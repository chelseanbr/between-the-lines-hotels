I booked on Hotwire and it only cost $97, but then they rob you when you get there with a $32 per night amenity fee. When I asked the lady at check in what amenities I get for my $32 she was speechless, then she said ""beach towels"" . Haha, beach towels that are old, stained, thin, thread bare, small and probably cost them $2 a piece when they bought them in bulk.

You know, the kind uou find at every grocery store ever. Yeah those. You also have the privilege of using rund down washing and drying machines that cost you $3 to wash and another $3 to dry. $30 a day well spent. Is your parking includes in this ""amenities"" package? No sir. You will pay $35 a day to park your car in an uncovered and unguarded parking lot in the middle of Waikiki.Also included with the amenities is the slowest wifi i have ever encountered at a hotel. It clocked in at a whopping 2.5mbps. But hey, at least you have that vending machine you can get Doritos out of to eat while your Netflix show is buffering.The rooms are fairly trashy and rather dirty. You should probably take your sheets down to the run down washing machine on the 3rd floor and wash them before you sleep on them. Also the cheapest mattresses i have come actoss in a hotel.

From the beautiful scenery of Waikiki Beach to all the tasty foods that line the streets of the city, to the activities only a tropical getaway can provide, I say enjoy the warm weather and get outside!If you’re like me wanting to save money but still desiring to escape to the islands, I highly recommend Pearl Hotel. Everything I wanted to do was very accessible - the beach, shopping, and pick-up to the snorkeling adventure I wanted to go on. My suggestions for an enjoyable stay and gentle-on-the pocket experience:1. Arrange pickup/drop-off to/from the airport through Robert’s Hawaii (transportation service)2. Walk a little. 5 more minutes of walking won’t kill you. This hotel is conveniently located ~10 minutes from the beach and guess what, it’s also almost $200 less per night compared to the other hotels in the area. There are plenty of eateries around too!3. Look for affordable lunch/dinner options. Try the local foods at the markets. I promise they are delicious. Spam musubis have protein and provide energy!!4. Use the drink voucher(s) that the hotel gives you. Hello - free drinks!!!5. Take advantage of the beach chair and towel service that the hotel provides as well. Yes, all of these things come with your hotel!!!Tips for Realistic Expectations of this Hotel:1. Amenities fee - they charge a small amenities fee that is not included in your stay (but WORTH it I promise). Mine was something like $60 for my entire stay of two nights here.2. Lets be real, this is not a luxury hotel. However, It is a CLEAN, affordable option. If you’re looking for coconut-scented bedsheets and an ocean view, ok this is not the place for you. But, if you want to enjoy Hawaii without breaking the bank, this is the one!3. Check-in is 3:00 p.m., check-out is noon. They will hold your bags before check-in time.4. The staff are very nice and always available to you. They have a texting service where you can reach them for any of your needs. On that note, thank you especially to Karen and Harry at the front desk for making my stay an enjoyable and professional experience.Hope this review helps you decide whether Pearl is the place for you. I would go back and I would certainly recommend it to my friends and family.",,Mandy C,0,5.0

We were on the 5th floor, on the night of October 3rd we saw a lady FALLING right past our balcony and land on the ground below. She fell from the 10th floor! The hotel won’t tell us the details, if she survived or not. We saw her twitching on the ground. The hotel won’t tell us if it was attempted murder, intoxication accident etc. It’s pretty scary thinking we could have possibly witnessed a murder. The police banged on our door shortly afterwards and woke the rest of our family up. We were up the entire night. I don’t like how hotel staff handled the situation whatsoever. It was very traumatic for us. They just seemed to want to sweep it under the rug and dismissed any questions we had. Besides the safety concern; the hotel room is outdated and gross. There are stains all over our carpet, our bedding and our window drapes have stains and holes as well. The bathtub is also stained and the bathroom as a whole just looks really dirty. The worst part are the mattresses and pillows- HARD AS A ROCK. I am not exaggerating- I am only 31 years old and have always prided myself on being able to sleep anywhere and backpack and camp wherever I like due to this ability. The ground is actually more comfortable than these mattresses. Every morning my neck and back hurt, I even bought a pillow at the mall because I couldn’t stand it. It’s absolutely awful. I am shocked this is considered a 3 star hotel. It is in need of much cleaning and updating. Oh, and we saw a cockroach!! I didn’t even know Hawai’i had these, I’ve never seen one on Maui. So there you go- if you have motel 6 expectations, you will be okay with this hotel- it’s on par with a one star motel, your average motel 6. If you want to sleep well and enjoy your vacation, I would stay elsewhere and get a place that actually had a pool as well. Another issue with the customer service- they pulled a switch on me. On the website they advertised $30 parking per day, then at the counter they told me $35 per day. What’s funny is they gave me a parking pass that says $30/day on it ‍♀️ I don’t trust the people that work here. Another important thing to note- WiFi is very sketchy. This was important to me, and we had continuous problems staying connected to the WiFi. When we could connect, signal was very weak.",,ChrissyHartunian,2,1.0

We'd tried to check in earlier than the 3pm start time, due to a red-eye flight the previous night, but they 'couldn't' make that work, so don't get your hopes up for that. They did store our luggage for a few hours while we walked around waiting. The room was basic, not comfy, but fairly spacious (because it's old). It's in a noisy area, w/ single-pane windows, so don't expect ""quiet"". It seemed clean enough. The AC was maxed out, but didn't really cool the room very well. Bathroom amenities were good. However, WIFI was bad (for America), which was very disappointing. I mean - this is America, hot spot, etc. Everyone uses internet, and needs good connectivity and speed.

Pros:-The staff are amazing. Keyneth, Agatha and Jason were instrumental in my transition onto the island. Whether asking for places to eat or just chatting after I got off work, they were kind, courteous, and friendly. Additionally, the management is incredibly helpful and accommodating if adjustments need made.-The location was very convenient, not only to entertainment, but also to the main thoroughfares in and out of the area. A wide variety of food and entertainment was only a short walk away, and I was able to save gas by frequenting them. -They were pet friendly. As I was bringing everything I owned, that included my furry companion, and it was great that he was able to reside there with me and not be kenneled. Additionally, the housekeepers were understanding and wouldn't clean unless I explicitly requested it so that he didn't inadvertently escape.Cons:-The building is old was not built to resist noise pollution. There were many times where I was woken in the middle of the night by some loud car roaring through that street. -The internet is trash. Wi-Fi in my room was next to unusable, and I frequently had to go to the International Marketplace in order to get tele-work done or even browse the internet without ripping through my cellular data plan.-Parking is interesting. Their parking lot consists of about 15 stalls behind the building, and are on a first come first served basis. This is not nearly enough for both the tourists rentals as well as the employees. However, I believe they are giving out parking passes for the Marketplace in order to relieve some of the congestion, but can't say with certainty.

The lobby is clean and has a few chairs where you can sit and watch an exciting video of the island while waiting to check in. There is a small parking lot in back, $30 a night, first come first served, which we decided to take advantage of because we just didn’t want to have to deal with trying to find parking in downtown Waikiki. There are ten floors with no outside common space; including no sun deck or pool, although on the street level of the hotel is a coffee shop with some outside seating (try the delicious fruity papaya bowl), and a bar. I was told that this is a budget hotel and our first room was definitely budget, like a roadside motel. Although well appointed with covers on the bed and closet; with a table and one chair, the walkway to all the rooms on that level was right outside and if you opened the drapes anyone walking by could see in. There was a microwave, mini fridge and coffee pot with packets of coffee and accompaniments. I had asked for a room with two beds (I was traveling with my 38 year old son) when I confirmed our reservation the week before, but when we checked in I was told that the room only had one bed. I complained (nicely) and was told that they were booked and that we could be moved to a room with two beds on Friday (we checked in on Wednesday), and they would send up a cot/rollaway bed to use until then. There wasn’t much they or we could do so we agreed and went up to our room.The staff were all very nice through all this and The next morning I went down to complain about the room (I’m not sure the clerk understand my analogy to a cheap motel room in Fresno); and the staff that morning said he thought he could get us another room and to pack up our bags and when we came back that afternoon he would have another room for us.This room was quite large, clean, with two comfortable beds, and was decorated similar to the first room. There was a spacious lanai looking over the street and city, giving us a pretty view of the city at sunrise and sunset, and we spent quite a bit of time out there relaxing especially the day it rained. The room was on the eighth floor so the street noise was not bad, although our neighbors did start playing music at 5:00 in the morning. The hotel is close to restaurants and shopping, but a bit of a hike to the beach going around, or through, the International Market. Parking is very difficult with metered spaces only, but there are two ABC Stores close by for water, snacks and other supplies. I would stay here again but probably no more than a few nights, and I would reserve a room with a lanai, and really if I was staying longer in Waikiki I would probably stay somewhere else, at one of the condotels with a kitchenette, pool and/or other common outside areas.","San Jose, California","Divermaiden</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",9,3.0

I didn't mind sharing, but when you are so close to someone for a vacation you want some of your own space at least while you sleep! Also, the internet was the slowest I've experienced anywhere, and the windows were paper thin. We never got accustomed to the time difference because we could hear every single thing from outside.

My husband and I stayed at this hotel from Monday til Sunday am. After the first day, we saw bugs. All thru the week, I kept getting bites. The manager did absolutely nothing. The desk clerk said he would take 40 dollars off our amenities which we did not use anyway and told him that. His comment was, if u had booked directly you would be paying me thousands. He said he would send someone up to spray. Not sure if that happened or not. We booked thru a travel agency. So the next day, we talked to a manager. Showed him all my bites. He came up to our room and kept telling us what good souls, people we are. He said he would change our room but the hotel was booked. The next day, which was our last day, I had more bites so I talked to another manager. This one was a black female. She looked at my bites, at least 10. She went up to our room 506 and her and my husband found what they thought was a small spider. She said yes, spider bites. When I told her that I may need to have my leg checked she ignored me. Said she would put us in one of their sister hotels and would call me by 12 to let me know where. Well I got the call and was told we were moving to the Aston hotel. My husband and I went back to the hotel. We were ere then told we were moving to the hotel next door, I believe the Hilton. But we would have to pay. She then said we r moving you to another room. She asked if we wanted someone to move us when the room was ready. We said yes. My husband and I left. We came back in a little while later and we were not moved. The manager came up and helped us move, 2 suitcases and 2 carry on's. I found out later, they charged us for moving our stuff. Well my husband and I went to walgreens. The pharmacist asked how I got so many bites. I said the hotel we are at. She told me what to use and said I needed to see a doctor over the bite on my leg. We went back to the hotel and told the manager. I asked her for the names of the urgent care. She asked if I was from the US and if I had insurance. I told her no I did not have insurance. Someone at the front desk gave them to me written on a piece of paper with the prices on it. I waited until I got home to see my doctor. I am on 4 different types of meds and she is worried about my leg. Also the housekeeping was terrible. There was blood on the bottom sheet, I asked for it to be changed. The housekeeper must have thought I was dumb. She put the sheet with the blood on the top. I found her on the floor and told her about the sheet. She said it wasnt her and she would call housekeeping. I went downstairs also and told them. They said they would call housekeeping. No one came, so later my husband threw the sheet on the floor. It stayed there until later the next day. There was hair in the bath tub that was not ours. We did not even used it yet. Management has not taken any responsibility except the 40 dollars the desk clerk gave us and a room change the last day we were there. In the meantime, I have at least 10, my doctor believes is BED BUG BITES and an seriously infected bite on my leg. I have pictures of my bites, etc. So please BEWARNED, BEWARE. I have written this to make people aware. There are also other reviews on here, people complaining about bugs and bed bugs. My travel agent made this reservation for us. We trusted them so did not review the reviews on this hotel. There were other problems but these are the main ones. When I first told a desk clerk I was bitten, the person said bed bugs, so apparently they were aware there was a problem. Enter at your own risk. They need to close this hotel and fix this bug problem! This bite is infected on my leg and got much worse after this picture was taken..",,Mary A,1,1.0

Bed very comfortable. Clean bathroom with good shower.Negatives were, too noisy, rude receptionist on arrival, rude concierge who was more interested in her own personal phone call than helping with a simple enquiry and we noticed she did the same thing to another guest a few days later. That concierge also misdirected us to a pick up location resulting in us missing our transport we had already paid for and so had to pay again for alternative pickup so we didn’t miss our excursion. However they seem to have different concierges on different days and the others seemed much nicer. The room in need of an update it was drab and disappointing and dark. The lighting was ineffective. The air con was very very noisy. Overlooked the car park which was horrible especially with car alarms going off which wasn’t the hotel staffs fault nor was the rubbish collection before dawn every morning which was incredibly loud. However they both added to our disappointing stay. For the size of the room there seemed to be furniture missing. Only one bedside set of drawers and one chair yet there was ample room for a coffee table and two chairs which would have made the room more comfortable.

I wouldn’t say it’s the cleanest but it’s manageable. The bathroom needs a makeover though. The toilet is sort of old and it makes a really loud flush and a lot of water builds up before it finally flushes. We thought that the toilet was clogged at first. The shower head has a bit of water stains and residue so maybe they could change the head every once in awhile? It was nice that they provide a PlayStation but there weren’t any games provided and no games were available for renting. They don’t have a pool but they do offer beach towels. No complimentary breakfast but for the price of the room, it’s not really an issue. They do have ice machines located on the 7th floor and vending machines on that floor as well. It was a little hard to find but it was mentioned in the paper they give you when you check in and it’s right next to the elevator. The ac in the room was a little weak. Didn’t really feel like it was on. The balcony was a little dirty so if you want to step outside you should bring some slippers. Overall the room is pretty good. Nothing really bothered me too much but it’s pretty loud at night and you can sometimes hear people fighting on the street. But the one thing I need to mention that I absolutely love is the location. It’s right across from international market place and Royal Hawaiian shopping center and many eateries. It’s a walking distance to the beach.

I’ve never stayed at a hotel like this before. From the moment we walked into the lobby, I knew it was a mistake to had booked our stay at this place. The building is really old. It looks like an old apartment building. When we walked into our room, it was very dark and dim inside (with the lights on). The first thing you hear is the LOUD A/C! Omg! Its very loud! The carpet was disgusting! There were stains everywhere! We didn’t get a remote for our TV. After being in our room for about an hour. THE A/C STOPPED WORKING! I called the front desk and told them about the A/C and missing TV remote. She told me that she would send the maintenance guy up. He comes into our room and starts looking for the remote control for the TV (like if we didn’t already do that). He couldn’t find it. Then he starts messing around with the A/C and nothing. So, he knocks on our neighbors door and asks if he can switch the BREAKER SWITCH on! The BREAKER BOX was in their room!! WTF?! As soon, as he turns the switch on, the A/C starts working again. A couple hours later, the A/C STOPS WORKING AGAIN!! She sends the maintenance guy up and he repeats the same scenario. Around 1:30am I woke up drenched in sweat! Guess what? The A/C broke AGAIN!!!!! I called the front desk, furious! She then tells me that the maintenance guy had gone home, and that she’ll send the SECURITY women up there. The security came into our room, I told her that she had to go into our neighbors room and switch the breaker switch back on. She didn’t want to do that, and told us to wait until the morning for the maintenance guy to come. At this point I was so angry and irritated! After the security left, the front desk called and asked if we wanted to switch rooms. I said no, because I didn’t want to pack all of our things and move at 1:30am! She then tells me that she’ll wave the hotel amenities fee ($20). What a joke! To make matters worse, there’s a sports bar attached to the hotel. All night, all we heard was screaming, loud bar goers. It was the worst experience ever! The following morning, I called the front desk because I desperately wanted to check out and GO ELSEWHERE. They told me that our stay was nonrefundable and if we left, we would still have to pay for the remaining nights. Also, be aware that they have LIMITED parking. We had to park across the street at the mall, because they ran out of parking spaces. Also, they never did wave that $20 fee for the inconvenience.

Anyways, they offered no apology, no kind of incentive/discount...nothing. Just blamed me for entire property consistent things (except maybe the drain, and it was late) That is the most unacceptable part of this. But, if you need a cheap, clean-ish, convenient place, and can sleep with what had to be a 30 dB AC, then you’re fine here most likely.

The door looked like it wouldn't be able to close, there was a crack in the top which made my husband a little wary about staying there. Secondly, parking was on a first come, first served basis. Thankfully there was a stall available when we arrived and when we returned from our shopping & dinner trip.

Parking was also a hassle, since the premises only had about 15 - 20 cars spot available and it was cost $30 a night and the only way to get a spot was to wake up early and be put on a waiting list. There were two other alternative; one was to find parking on the street which can be a nightmare or be directed to a parking garage two blocks away and pay $35 a night.

We noticed at check-in and check-out that many other guests were from other islands in Hawaii; that's a good recommendation. Graciousness, hospitality, patience, cleanliness, spacious and hospitable rooms, and LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. It's all here. I'm a flight attendant who's been traveling to Waikiki (for pleasure, not work) multiple times per year since 1997. This is the best value for money you will find, PERIOD, and a pleasure to call your home in Waikiki. I have been staying at this property since 1997. As a flight attendant, I have lots of opportunities to visit Waikiki and I've taken advantage of every one of them. Having been all over the world, my husband still says Waikiki is his ""happy, beautiful place."" I have recommended the Aqua Waikiki Pearl to friends, family and colleagues and they have always reported favorably. I stayed here from March 6-10 of 2017 -- my first visit in too long, and my companion's very first to Hawaii -- and the Pearl is better than it's ever, ever been. I cannot recommend the Pearl enough. For one thing, there's the location. You are a few minutes walk to the best of the beach. Next door is a small grocery; on the other side is a coffee shop. Across the street, a liquor store/grocery and Korean restaurant. A 24-hour supermarket and bus stops are within those same five minutes. The remade (and now quite glitzy, if you ask me) International Marketplace is practically on the doorstep of the Pearl. Our room, 813, was spacious, with a full kitchen and lanai. (Our leftovers from the various restaurants we visited were put to excellent use.) It was impeccably clean and we didn't see an insect on the property the whole time we were there -- amazing in the tropics. We chose to forego daily maid service, but when we saw the maid on the way in or out she was generous with a stack of towels and coffee when we asked. There's a pet-friendly policy; we didn't see a pet, nor did we ever see or smell any evidence of one, and that's as it should be. Our reservation was made last-minute (the only way an airline employee travels) and accepted graciously. We were greeted with a basket of canned juices and candies, free beach towels and beach chairs. Many of the wonderful staff members were folks I recognized from years back. Lisa, who staffs the tour desk in the lobby, was very helpful arranging our visit to Pearl Harbor. The front desk clerks Ape and Jo were extraordinary. Please accept my ""mahalo"" and believe me when I say that I cannot wait to return -- perhaps as soon as May -- with my husband.

The desk clerk told us the biggest complaint they have is about street noise. Although our first room at the front was large with a balcony, we moved to a smaller room at the side because of the street noise. Some of the air conditioners are super loud. Also the hotel charges $18 per day per room over and above the room rate for access to amenities that many other hotels offer as part of the room fee. These 'amenities' include coffee in the room, DVD rentals, borrowed beach chairs, and the Aqua shuttle.

No pool, no breakfast but location is good (especially to new International Market place) and perfect to catch buses to anywhere on the island. We didn't use the scheduled shuttle to Ala Moana. Apples and all day coffee in lobby are a nice touch. Food pantry supermarket just around the corner.Standard rooms are decent sized and have coffeemaker, fridge and microwave (warmed up my leftovers from dinner just fine).

The weather was perfect but, in my opinion, it turns out to be nothing more than ""an expensive tourist trap"". Service is generally poor. The overall ambiance of the place is tired and not very welcoming. Our chosen accommodation turned out to be quite basic - hard beds, no room seating, poor ammenities; and very bad internet in a building that was suffering from poor maintenance. The added daily amenities charge on each room provided little in enjoyment to the guests. Creating a seperate charge for things like water in lobby and towels for the beach is a bit over the top.

Okay, yes, the hotel certainly could do with a make-over, it badly needs modernising. Having said that, the bed was comfortable, the room was clean, so no complaints there. I was surprised, though, to see ear plugs resting on the bedside locker. It was obvious, though, why these were needed when you switched on the air-con!! What a noise it made! Did it keep me awake at night? No, I just turned it off! One thing the hotel has absolutely no control over, however, is the noise that about 200 birds, no exaggeration!, made about 5.00 in the evening and again about 5.00 in the morning. They gathered on a big tree each evening to rest for the night, they obviously had a lot to talk about each time they all met, because the noise was incessant. And the same each morning!! Anyway, it is nature, so we must just get on with life. Check-in was simple enough, but as I did not have a car I was not asked to pay $30.00 per night parking fee. What I did have to pay, though, was a resort fee of about $19.00. This entitled you to free WiFi, a newspaper, DVD rental, free shuttle bus to Ala Moana Shopping Mall and a few other small things. One issue with the free shuttle is that it does not actually stop at this hotel, you have to walk to the next block, about 150 metres, to pick it up. It does, apparently, drop you back directly to the hotel. I went down to the sister hotel one day to get the shuttle, and was told that there would be one along in about 5 minutes. As far as I am aware, it never came, at least I did not see it. The best option, though, is to take the Pink Line Bus, cost $2.00, to go to this Mall, the free shuttle runs about every 40 minutes, whereas the Pink Line bus runs about every 10 minutes. Your choice. The hotel room boasts a microwave, coffee maker and fridge. As well as an iron, ironing board and of course a safe. I only used the safe and the fridge, which was stocked with 2 complimentary bottles of water upon my arrival. These were easily topped up in the foyer. There are also complimentary soap, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, replaced daily. The room was made up every day, and the towels replaced as needed. There is a sports bar as part of the premises, with a market just opposite and another one about 50 metres away, if you need to get groceries, etc. This hotel is about 5 - 7 minutes walk, through the International Market Shopping Mall, to Waikiki Beach. There are plenty, plenty of dining options in the locality, but one thing I was not quite prepared for was the prices! Very, very expensive, even for a coffee!! Don't expect a fantastic experience at this hotel, the staff are helpful, (there is a concierge also located at the sister hotel), the room pleasant, but the best thing going for this hotel is the location, unless you want to pay extravagant money for a beach-side location.","Dublin, Ireland","AtrueDub</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",76,4.0

I asked to speak to her manager and she told me to call back in the morning. That is the worst customer service I have ever received.

Good reviews always mention the staff, and I agree they are all wonderful, they make you feel so welcome. We stayed in a Junior Lanai Suite, number 908 and it was perfect for us. The room was HUGE and the bathroom clean and had everything we needed. The Lanai was massive too and was awesome to enjoy a few longboards on. The hotel is right by the International Marketplace, and a really short walk to the beach. For the price it is perfect. There are heaps of food options nearby, and the DVD service was awesome too.

This hotel is not the Hilton, or The Modern, and no you probably won't get as many Instagram likes tagging yourself here, but seriously, you are in Hawaii, who cares. My ONLY suggestion would be that perhaps they need to have more people working on the front desk, as often at check in and out there were long queues. If you are questioning whether to stay here, don't request room 908, or book a junior lanai suite and have a good time outside of your hotel room!

Great location and lots of space for 5 people. Kitchen and fridge are a plus when trying to save money on food. Yes I would agree that the carpets could be cleaned better and the construction is a pain but let's be honest....you are in Hawaii and shouldn't be spending all your time in the room. It's a place to sleep and shower. As long as the room is clean (which it was) and the shower works I'm good. They have made some upgrades since we were last here: instead of first come first serve for parking it has to be reserved (if all spots are taken then you can park 2 blocks away), movie rentals, for the 2 bedrooms they now have a wall instead of a curtain for the 2nd room, and lastly nice beach towels and chairs you can use at the beach.

We chose something middle of the road. This is an older style in need of a refurb. The reception and housekeeping staff are really lovely. We stayed in a junior suite, as we were there for 12 days and wanted a bit of extra room. The verandah was large, though the view was of the rooftops on the opposite of the road. Nice lights at night though. The bathroom was roomy and looked as if the vanity had been refurbed. There was a safe, tv, chair, a fridge, microwave, coffee maker & the bench this was on looked to be refurbed. The junior suite has a double bed & a queen bed in it. We found the bedding comfortable & clean. The carpet had lots of marks on it. The housekeeping did a great job of cleaning the rooms. It's a short walk to the beach. The position is great. Handy to bus stops & the Food Pantry for supplies. The new Garden Hilton is being built next door. It's also across the road from the new International Marketplace which will be finished this year. There's also a sports bar downstairs which has US$3.50 Mai Tais from midday to 8pm. That's a great bargain! We were on the 10th floor & it was a bit noisy but I think that's only because of the construction of the Hilton & International Marketplace.

Check in time was suppose to be 3pm however that was not the case and even by 4pm the staff behind the counter looked bewildered with a blank look to say, ""yes we are on the computer screen and booked in but not sure if you can check in yet"". The carpets were all dirty and stained and I'd recommend you wear some sort of shoe inside to prevent your feet from getting dirty. On a couple of occasions we were not given enough towels for the number of family members staying in the room. The insinkerator did not work, and one hot plate only worked out of two. One of the towel rails fell off the vanity basin area and had to be fixed. Our other family members were staying in another room in the same hotel and their TV did not work and they had to be moved rooms as the first room was so dirty. Also on one occasion their toilet lever fell off and the toilet did not work (3:30pm) and when they rung down to reception they were told that someone would come the next day to fix it. Of course they had to say that that response was unacceptable because they needed to use the toilet over night and into the morning hours! The photos of the accommodation show nice outside balcony furniture. This is not the case. There are now other plastic chairs. It also shows nice flowers, vases and coloured cushions on beds in the marketing photos. These did not exist. And the bathroom in the marketing photos shows the towels all presented nicely and this was not the case either. I would recommend you do your research first on other accommodation before you stay here. Also it is very noisy from 4:00am onwards with rubbish trucks and then construction going on around the building. They do provide ear plugs for their guests next to the beds. For the cost of this place to stay I did expect a lot better. It was very disappointing. It was annoying that we always had to tell staff of their problems, such as not enough towels, hot plate not working, and so on when they should be maintaining and inspecting the rooms all the time to make sure they are in working order. We paid for a room that was in working order which it wasn't and staff seemed to not really care.

That could have been explained when we called. Never heard of any bond amount changing due to the room type in any hotel before.

Had to make my own sofa bed then asked for extra towels twice but was never brought up on the first night. Not quite sure if they're under construction with their car parking but there's limited space with their on site car parking so you'll need park at a different location when it's full and pay the car parking direct with cash and the hotel will remove that charge from your bill.

We had booked the Aqua Oasis 3 weeks earlier for just one night, but on arrival at Oasis at 2pm we were told that the Oasis was 'overbooked/rooms had become unusable' and so we were shifted to one of their sister properties - the Pearl. Not particularly happy about that but we really had no choice as it was afternoon and the hotel had already been paid for. Oasis paid for our cab to the new hotel. At the Pearl, we were upgraded to a massive double suite which was very nice. All clean, good towels, nice linen and comfy bed. You gt very nice quality beach towels too. Must say that ALL of the staff at the Pearl were exceedingly helpful and this partially made up for the issue with Oasis. The location was just fine for a quick walk to the beach. There was construction going on next to the Pearl and so was a bit of a worry to see earplugs on the bedside table, but we didn't have any noise issues in the morning, although there was a bit during the day but we weren't really hanging out in the room... Our room faced away from the construction so I'm not sure how others would have fared... I note that other reviewers have commented about cleanliness - we certainly had no problems at all in our room. (Of note, I did send an email to the attention of the manager of the Aqua Oasis but at almost 1 week later I have still had no response or acknowledgement.... that's a bit disappointing and in contrast to the attention shown by the Pearl staff and manager- think her name was Nicole)","Perth, Australia","AussieFrog</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",27,4.0

Very friendly and efficient. I have no problem at all with the people here. So they really a positive.As for the negatives, hey, it's an old building and it shows. It's run down inside and out. The carpeting in the hallways is soiled and worn. Same can be said for the walls in the hallways. I usually like to take the stairs anyway, a good thing because the elevator is slow and not air conditioned. The room amenities are pedestrian and average. Was this meant to encourage us to get out of our rooms and explore Oahu? If so, it worked. The maid service, incidentally, somehow forgot to make our bed when we arrived late in the afternoon. Not sure what happened there, but came back to see the sheet on the bed but nothing else. And they brought only one replacement towel for a family of three. The parking situation is not good. One is forced to use the valet service, as the parking lot is tiny given the size of the property. They have to move cars around just to get your car out of the lot. If you don't have a rental car, no worries, as the location is quite near public transportation and walkable to nicer places.The location is central but in a beat down part of waikiki, with a lot of construction going on. Very loud and noisy during business hours. A seedy looking bar located right at the entrance to the hotel made for awkwardness with two young kids with me. They do have a cool tree with lots of raucous birds in the morning. It is a bit out of place in such an urban environment, but I actually thought that was really cool, so I hope they don't chop it down!We only stayed three days and transferred to a lovely B&B on the windward side of the island.

However, we would likely not return to this hotel due to the fact that the condition of the hotel is far less than we had hoped it would be. The rooms looked nothing at all like they did on the pictures online. The hotel itself as well as the rooms specifically are significantly more run-down than the pictures show... The pictures I viewed before booking were unfortunately not an accurate depiction of the look or condition of the rooms themselves. The construction going on was TERRIBLE which made our stay very difficult to enjoy- especially if we wanted to relax on our vacation with some sleep in time... It was nearly impossible. I understand that it's certainly not intended to be a high end hotel, but we have stayed at MANY other budget hotels that were in far better shape and presented a far better value. Quite frankly, the rooms are just WAY too overpriced given the very old condition of the rooms and the hotel.

The staff are always willing to answer every question you may have. The trolley to Ala Moana shopping complex is located at the end of the street. I suggest using their concierge and booking tours once you are there as there no agent fees like here in Australia. In addition to this the concierge was very knowledgeable and he was honest in his recommendations. Check in was quite lengthy and the lobby was very hot. Not the ideal situation when coming off a 9 hour flight. The female that we checked in with was fantastic and very friendly. She would have to have been our favourite staff member. I wish I knew her name. We were told at time of check in (2pm) that our room was not ready. The hotel stated they could take our bags and we went and had a drink in the bar while we waited another hour. We only had one staff member (female) who was somewhat rude when we came back to collect our room key. But this was our only poor example of customer service and we didn't really see her after that so we were happy. When we entered our room it was very cool and clean. The bathroom was clean and water pressure was fantastic. The balcony was great in the evening. There is construction happening but it did not really affect us too greatly. We were not told about the construction upon booking but as we booked with our travel agent the fault does not lay with the hotel. We were always welcomed back into the hotel by staff members.

To the contrary they were tired/dated and the rooms smelled stale. We were on the 2nd floor with a balcony over looking the road with a noisy pub not far away. We booked a 1 bedroom suite so my teenagers could have their own bed - 1 in a room and the other on the couch which folded into a bed. We unfolded the sofa bed and a few cockroaches skittered out and the bed had definitely seen better days with a big sag in the middle. There also small cockroaches on the bench and the cupboards. There were 3 air-conditioning units in each room with a remote but none of them worked. The very large bathroom was accessed through the master bedroom so not ideal for anyone needing the bathroom during the night. We arrived at 11pm at night after a 9 hour flight and were checking out early the next day to drive to the North Shore. We didn't complain about the issues as we were so late checking in that we just couldn't be bothered. We did go for a walk on arrival to stretch our legs and although fairly close to the main shopping area it was a pretty seedy part of town. Good points - the staff at check in and check out were very polite and courteous, especially with our late arrival. There was parking on site directly behind the building $25 per day which was convenient.

Not fully understanding what was on offer we went to the rooms and found that they were next to each other but not connected in any way. The one bedroom ""apartment"" had a foul odour (stale urine) which we reported to reception and asked to be resolved. The next day the smell was still there and so they sent a carpet cleaner in. Coming back 8 hours later we found the smell still there. We were offered a room change but that meant having two rooms on different floors so we moved into the room that didn't stink. How they could even let people into the stink room in the first place is amazing. Then not show much care that there was a problem, wow! Add to all this the carpets in both rooms were stained. The balcony doors in one room were corroded to the extent that they could not open from one end. The bath plug in the other room was stuck in place. On top of all this the hotel, without prior advice, levies a $15/day compulsory ""Hospitality Fee"" for DVD rental (not wanted), Waikiki shuttle(not wanted), daily newspaper in lobby(not wanted), in room coffee,(not wanted), in room safe, local calls (not wanted), water in lobby, coffee in lobby from 7am to 11am(!), weekly manager's reception (every Tuesday from 2pm to 3pm - are they serious?) + ""complimentary"" WiFi. On the website and in the booking process the WiFi is touted as free. I asked for a refund on the big room and was given a pathetic $145 discount amounting to around 10% which I had no option but to take as I was on my way to catch a plane.This place is a disaster.

Our first part of our honeymoon was spent at the moana Surfrider which is an amazing beach front hotel. Aqua Waikiki doesn't compare in terms of elegance but it was very clean and the hotel staff and services were actually better here than the moana and the Sheraton Kauai. Upon arrival front desk attendant Dee was very pleasant and without us knowing upgraded us to a deluxe top floor room. This room was huge with three bedrooms and a fully serviced kitchen, huge fridge and stove and oven. This would be a great affordable room for a big family. It was the only place that recognised our honeymoon and they left us a nice gift of chocolate macadamias and champagne. Really pleasant surprise from a hotel that was far cheaper than our other two hotels. They provide a free shuttle to ala moana shopping centre and also free DVD rentals in the foyer. Both other more expensive hotels wanted $20 a movie. Again a cheaper hotel with better services. It's only a street sway from Waikiki beach.

Steps away from great food like Marukame Udon, minutes away from Island Vintage Coffee, witch is packed every day.And to top it all off, awesome FREE, not pay, wi-fi in EVERY room, not just the lobby like most other hotels.

Parking is also not free, so take that into consideration with the cost of the hotel if you have a car.

When checking out, get your car, pay the $20 parking fee in cash, if you use a card to pay its $23, then bring your receipt to have that $20 credited back to your overall bill - if you've paid the parking with the card and paid the $23 they will only reimburse the $20. I found this incredibly inconvenient. More so because these were surprises upon check in. It was a lot of hassle. We came from Maui so only had a backpack - if we would have had actual luggage, I would have been beyond irritated. They charge a $100 damage deposit upon check in as well as a $35 hospitality fee. The $100 was refunded but it usually takes ""7-10 days"".I get that it's Hawaii and you're going to pay more for things and additional fees and probably feel inconvenienced, but come on.... Let us know before we book the room. The second floor room we had was loud. Street noise as well as parking lot noise. Birds are part of being in Hawaii so that was expected. The staff was very friendly and the water was hot - that's about the only positive about the place.",,usetheforce21,11,3.0

What you must remember to ask for though is a 3 bedroom apartment with 3 defined bedrooms. We didn't do this on our most recent visit and when we arrived in our room it had 2 defined bedrooms and the third was a room off the living area which was divided between the living area by a curtain! We went down to reception to request a 3 bedroom apartment with 3 defined bedrooms but unfortunately one wasn't available for 3 days. The staff were more than accommodating and said they would be more than happy to assist our party of 6 to move rooms. On the morning the apartment became available the staff were true to their word and had the new room cleaned and available and assisted with the move.One other tip is that if there are more than 4 people staying in your room you will need to request extra plates and cutlery as the apartments are only set up for four persons. Since our last stay the International Market Place which was located just at the end of the street has been demolished and a huge construction site is now underway. Our first room was located down the same end as the construction site and we were awoken each morning to the sounds of construction, when we changed rooms the noise certainly was not as bad. So request a room at the far end of the building.The kitchen was adequate with a large fridge, two hot plates and a microwave oven. Our room was serviced everyday with fresh towels, bins emptied and our beds remade. The staff from front reception to cleaning were always polite, friendly and helpful.Starbucks is located right next door and good for the morning pick me up with the Food Pantry just on the next block for all your food supplies.

It was very central and only about a 5-10 minute to the beach with plenty of restaurants (both fine dining and even take away) surrounding it. Only a block or so away was all the big brand retail players such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Cartier etc... but I guess if your staying somewhere cheap like here you'd only really be window shopping like we were. Anyway, as for the hotel, we received a free upgrade upon check-in which involved being on level 2 with a massive balcony that faced the street. We initially were quite chuffed and happy with the upgrade given the size of the room (it had two queen beds with one completely in another room, couch, kitchen, kitchen table etc... basically a two bedroom apartment with a huge bathroom). The was room way too large for just my wife and I but we didn't mind. We realised this was perhaps the noisiest room (room 202) as it was directly above the ""Legends Bar"" and you could also hear all the traffic running in the street and connecting busier street... the worse of the noise was the garbage truck that stumbled through at 4 am...

The only thing he kept saying to me was that we're getting another balcony...like that was going to make up for having two separate rooms? I think not. We couldn't even get into the smaller of the two rooms until 3 hours after check in because they shampooed the carpets and they were still damp. I had to go down to the front desk and demand the keys for that room. We had a party of 8 girls and needed that second bathroom to get ready.

I picked the wrong one. I booked a room for 4, and got a room with one bed. They said i booked it that way, but i checked my confirmation later and i was right. The room only had one small window that was half taken by a window air conditioner. They say they have on site parking, but they have enough for their staff and maybe 10 cars. They have an overflow at a parking garage 3 blocks away. It Would have been nice to know the truth. The room i got was a little bigger than a closet, and had uncomfortable beds. I asked 3 times for an extra pillow, and in two days it never showed up. They staff is friendly, but seems to only tell you what you want to hear so you will go away.

We were really excited for our first time in hawaii but exhausted and were looking for someone where to freshen up,or relax ie our room. Unfortunately we arrived at 7am and the check in wasn't till 3pm! I was majorly pissed off because what was I supposed to do for 8hours with a 2 year old?? Anyway we had overlooked that on itinerary so I accept that. What I didn't like was the factory-like, not in the slightest empathetic response from ""Harry"" or ""Henry"" at reception. I don't think he could of given two hoots about our situation and casually waved his hand at the reception area and toilet area to wait for the next 8 hours. My dad was understandably upset as he was here to celebrate his birthday and didn't care to be spoken to like a backpacker. I was so distressed with the way Henry or Harry handled us I couldn't speak to him for the rest of our stay. All that aside, they manage to get us a one of our rooms out of three at 2pm which we were grateful for but I must say on level 7 the rooms were extremely mediocre and so were the amenities. They said they would call us when the other rooms became available...and they didn't. When we went down to find out the problem there were a bunch of other people suffering the same fate as us amongst other problems. This was not looking good. Apparently they had overbooked the hotel and as a result we did not get what we paid for which was one 2 bedroom suite and 1 bedroom suite with kitchenette. The best they could offer us after my dad had to come down and sort it out was the 1bedroom suite and two deluxe rooms. We relented as they were struggling and their was no point going on about and their was nothing we could do now. We were just becoming more and more devastated. To cut a disastrous and majorly long story short- the girls at the reception were extremely apologetic and helpful and tried to make best of the situation at hand. The rooms on level 4 & 7 were very budget and the hotel I believe is more like a two star- very very basic. It's ok in terms of location but I would just spend the extra and stay on kalakauka drive if you want to experience the real hawaii.

The first day we arrived, without even sleeping in the beds yet, the sheets were disgusting and stained, so we called reception for them to be changed.

There was hair all around the shower and plug hole. There was mould on the shower head. Dust and hair all over the bathroom floor - clearly they do not vacuum the bathrooms. Later that night we found cockroaches in the bathroom. I advised my concerns and utter disgust in how filthy the room was and asked to be moved. Later that day we were moved to 910. The room was slighty a bit cleaner. However again the bathroom had hair on the floor. House keeping came at 8.30am!!! Had to tell them to come back as we were still sleeping. Who starts cleaning the rooms at 8.30am??? When check out is at mid-day?? My friend also got attacked by bed bugs on the last few nights of our stay, which must have been transferred via the sheets. When we advised reception of this the manager on that day was not concerned about it at all. The only two good things I can say about this place is about the one manager which was extremely helpful and always kind her name I think from memory was Chantelle? and the location, that it is close to places and good walking distance to get to the beach. Would not recommend this place to anyone.

Although The Pearl is a little over a block from the beach, we found the location great as it was central to everything and a little out of the hustle and bustle of busy Waikiki beach. We stayed in a Junior suite which was really spacious and the room was spotless and very comfortable. There is a little road noise at night but as we were on the 8th floor it wasn't enough to worry us or stop us from getting a good night sleep. The staff were amazing. All so friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. The concierge, Jasmine helped us with all our bookings for excursions and we can't thank her enough. Everyone went out of their way to make sure our stay was as comfortable and enjoyable as it possibly could be. A special mention to Mark and Dee, two of the nicest people we have ever met. We can't praise them enough for their professionalism and for making us feel so welcome. Their knowledge of the local area was outstanding. While this hotel is not as fancy as others in the area, we found all the amenities and facilities of a very high standard. If you have a budget and don't want to pay for too many fancy extras, this is the hotel to stay at. The hotel was great and the staff were outstanding.Once again, a big thank you to Mark and Dee... you are both fabulous :0)","Brisbane, Australia","Lenore3008</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",0,5.0

Hotel also provide beach towels and chairs if needed - we did not use this but would be useful if staying for more than a night.Our main problem with the hotel was the noise - our room was on the 2nd floor and neither of us were able to sleep for more than a couple of hours due to constant noise of cars and what sounded like a massive generator directly outside our window. Our main reason for staying was to get rest so we could make the most of the next day in Oahu and we didn't achieve that.

The biggest factor in choosing this hotel was the price; it is significantly cheaper for a large group than many other hotels in the area. We knew it was a huge risk going for the cheap option, but we were very happy with the value we got for our money. It was 7 of us in a 3-bedroom suite; our room was very clean and comfortable, everything in the room worked as it was supposed to, and the staff was always friendly and helpful. The hotel isn't first-class luxury, but that's not what we were looking for in staying here.The only issues we had were trivial. The wi-fi was sometimes spotty during the day (presumably when more people were using it), but who goes to Hawaii to sit in their hotel room browsing the internet? At night it was much faster. Also, sitting on the balcony there was a lot of noise from the street, but none of our bedrooms faced the road so it wasn't noticeable while sleeping (at least, not from the 8th floor).What I would not recommend though, is staying here with a car. The parking lot is very small and was full most nights, which probably means there are many people who had to look for spaces elsewhere. However, in my opinion, if you're a tourist staying in the Waikiki area you don't need to rent a car except maybe for a day-trip of the island; bus stops for public transit and tour buses are all within a block, and they will take you anywhere you want to go. Just about everything we needed during our stay, including the beach (who needs a pool?), was less than a 5-minute walk away, and we were easily able to make ourselves at home.In summary, we had an entirely positive experience here, and would definitely recommend it to groups who don't need a lot of bells and whistles in a hotel room, and especially for people who don't want to break the bank on accommodations. We will be back.","Calgary, Canada","Vijay R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",4,5.0

Booked a junior suite for my family of four and a 7-day vacation. Check-in was efficient; the specifics--ice and vending at the 7th floor, laundry station on the 4th, cards that you exchange for free beach towels and vice versa, hotel entrance close by 10 p.m. (room key gains access), complimentary coffee, water and apples in the lobby, and free wi-fi (no password needed). Room was spacious and clean, well-kept actually considering the number of visitors here. Cable TV even had a Filipino channel so we were up-to-date with current events. A/C easily controlled by remote. Ref and microwave come in handy. Balcony even has a blower to dry your swimwear really fast! My family slept so soundly we needed a daily alarm to get us going. And now, the location. Starbucks, Subway and Chili's just a few steps away. Food Pantry for groceries, a pharmacy, an ABC store just around the corner. Histeaks inside Food Pantry offers quick hot meals, our constant source of rice and newly cooked eggs. No wonder the hotel does not have a restaurant, none needed. Ross and the Hawaiian Royal mall (Macy's, H&M, Cheesecake Factory) as well as the ""night market"" just a couple of blocks away. Bus, shuttle and trolley stops within a minute, Waikiki beach within ten and the zoo and aquarium within twenty. Your hotel card gives free entrance to kids and discount to adults in the aquarium. Posted in the hotel elevators are daily weather forecasts and free activities and shows very helpful to tourists. At the lobby is a tour desk that can arrange practically anything from helicopter and submarine tours to shows. We watched The Magic of Polynesia with acclaimed illusionist John Hirokawa and enjoyed it immensely. We also tried the Waikele premium outlet (round trip pick-up by shuttle is 15 dollars) and found the store selection quite limited; there is a K Mart and a Lowe's as a consolation. Finally, must make mention of the hotel staff who were always helpful, polite and hospitable. Dee and Mark were the best.

This was totally our choice, the person on the desk asked if we wanted someone to bring the bags up once the lifts were operational. The room had a microwave and a fridge.

HOWEVER, there is a GREAT breakfast at a diner about 1/2 block away. It was a FULL breakfast (fixed meal:2 eggs, bacon, and toast with coffee), but was great. The second morning (due to jet lag) we awoke at 5 a.m. and ate at an IHOP about 4 blocks away. Perfectly safe. We had dinner in the Holiday Inn's restaurant. Again, a walk of less than 1/2 block.So location for the Aqua Pearl is great. What is the best secret is that the rooms are HUGE. There was a microwave and small refrigerator. We could have cooked our own meals and there is a grocery store just around the corner. We met a guy who said that he lives in the hotel for about 5 or 6 weeks each year, and cooks his meals in his room.So you could stay on the beach and pay a lot of $$$ or stay at the Pearl and save that money.The staff for the hotel could not do enough for us. The check in clerk was great and whenever we needed help, we got it. I had problems printing my Qantas boarding pass, and the desk clerk literally spent about 30 minutes helping us out and printing our pass.This is a wonderful hotel to save money.

While the hotel itself is quite old, renovations to the rooms made them quite comfortable. I was surprised at how spacious the room was, and the fact that it came equipped with a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker made for stress-free mornings. The balcony was quite large as well, and offered a pretty good view of the city. The location was very convenient -- very close to the beach, restaurants, shopping. Having the Food Pantry close by let us pack healthier food options to the beach. We especially felt at-home because of the hotel staff -- always very friendly and accommodating. Special shout out to Dee for helping us with restaurants and directions and bus routes. She made us feel like family. The only complaint I have is that as the International Marketplace was being torn down, and the trucks and heavy equipment would start working early in the mornings.

As this was a last minute getaway at spring break I was having a difficult time finding a room that was affordable and available for the entire week of my stay. I selected it from the secret hotel deals. When the shuttle driver turned down the street i knew that i was probably going to look elsewhere. However it was late and raining heavily and I was exhausted. The front desk clerk was friendly and the lobby was bright and inviting. my room was large with a full balcony microwave coffee maker and mini fridge. But that is it for ameneties, there is no pool or shops however, the hotel is clean and the staff was very helpful and quick to address my questions and even arranged a tour for me. What the hotel lacks in extras it makes up for in service and location. Because it is located on a side street the view from my room on the 8th floor was mostly old rooftops and trashcans but the location was convienent, a block and a half from the beach, a few blocks to shopping with a Starbucks 2 doors down and Legends sports bar on property. I was concerned about noise but while i could hear music from the ground floor, my room was very quiet even with the lanai doors open. There is also a convienence store and scuba shop directly accross the street and a full grocery right around the corner and lots of fast food restaurants to choose from. While the street that the hotel is located on (Nahua) is basically quiet in the evening there is construction on the corner as they are building a mall and it starts early in the morning with the noise and lasts until about 6 pm. I was out of the room most of the day so it was no bother. , if you want night life it is easilly accessable just around the corner. The Makititi offers a full international buffet with a polynesian show for 19.99 the show was pretty basic but the seafood buffet was excellent with all kinds of fresh choices. close to the Zoo, Aquarium, and about 30 minute hike to Diamond Head For the price I went twice during the week i stayed.

But in the end, after comparing many reviews, we made up our minds to stay at this place and this was definitely a good choice. We really liked its location in a side street of Kuhio Ave. but still within walking distance of Waikiki Beach. This makes the place to be quiet enough but also to be close enough to all the action, shops, restaurants and so on.In case you don't hire a car when you arrive at Honolulu airport, an easy and cheap way to get to this hotel is by public buses 19 or 20 (they allowed us to board them with our luggage :-)). It is true that the ride takes an hour and fifteen minutes (or maybe a little bit more) but it just costs 2,5$ (you must have the exact amount when boarding the bus because no change is given if you only have bigger bills). These two buses have a stop in Kuhio Ave. just before Nahua St, where the hotel is, so you only have to walk a couple of minutes to get there from this bus stop.The staff that welcomed us was very friendly, helpful and cheerful, so it looks like they have fun doing their job. Good for them! By the way, it is here, in front of the front desk where they have an Apple computer for guests who do not travel with laptops or other devices. We always appreciate that (we also appreciated the self-laundry they have). The only thing that we could not enjoy was a complimentary breakfast because this hotel doesn't offer it. They do neither offer a swimming pool but well..., who does want a swimming pool when Waikiki Beach is just ten minutes away? Conversely what they do offer are big, comfortable, clean and well equipped rooms (at least our was very big and fully equipped with refrigerator, microwave, tea/coffee facilities and a good and not loud air-conditioning). Our room had also a spacious balcony over Nahua St. which was not noisy at all.

When our family arrived, they said they no longer had the room I reserved and paid for because they had overbooked. They said they would check other sister properties but supposedly none were available so we were stuck in two rooms down the hall from each other.

The carpets are stained, the sliding door won't open without extreme pushing, lamps don't work in bedroom, two burner stove wrapped in aluminum, noisy all night!

The only bright light is that the staff are very friendly and apologetic and why I didn't insist on moving us somewhere else but I think buyer beware if you are a family with kids that won't sleep through the noises from thin walls.","Vancouver, Washington","rrosepetal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Washington</strong>",87,1.0

Beds were a little hard for my taste. It was about a 10 minute walk to the beach and we loved the International Market Place nearby - so sad to find out it is being torn down.

Our rooms was small and drab but clean. After a few night we asked for an upgrade which we got for just $25 a night to a junior suite which was plenty of room for our family of 3. This was a much better room. I recommend you go for this kind of room if you are staying unless you are really on a tight budget. Staff are really friendly and helpful. Beautiful touch as we were there over Christmas and New Year was a gift left in our rooms. A handy carry all bag for Christmas and for New years a bag of tasty good quality snacks. This was a lovely touch. The location is very convenient to everything in Waikiki across from International Markets (which were closing down at the time of our stay to make room for the Saks 5th avenue complex). Some street noise but so has other higher class and price hotels we have stayed at. I am not sure what the plans are the hotel to match the new upmarket neighbours, but a facelift would be good.

This hotel was perfect! It was a 15-20 minute walk to the start and was a 10-15 minute walk from the finish (Honolulu Zoo.)From what I recall, it is not a resort so a resort fee was not added on and thus made the price within our budget. Overall, the hotel is clean, quiet, and has all the necessities people need. I didn't think it was a luxury hotel but the service provided by the front desk receptionists and cleaners always exceeded my expectations, hence the 5 star rating. As for parking, it cost $23/night if you parked at the back (which was quite small and had a tendency to be full after 6pm.) They have an agreement with a parking garage at the Waikiki Trade Center where it cost $20 cash (but you have to show your Aqua Pearl Waikiki parking pass when exiting.) The garage folks then staple a receipt on it and you have to show the parking pass and receipt to the front desk of Aqua Waikiki Pearl so they can delete the $23 charge on their system for that night. Just an FYI.Overall I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Waikiki beach was a 5 minute walk and while there, you'll find vendors trying to give you a free surf lesson, free ukelele lesson, etc. (similar to what the 5* hotels in the area offer to their guests for free.)","New York, NY","joey0530</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NY</strong>",82,5.0

Great location! Just a short stroll from the beach, Waikiki shops and restaurants. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The room has everything you expect and need out of a hotel room.Negatives- This hotel is NOISY and there is absolutely no noise proofing on the windows! There is a pub just under the hotel which gets pretty rowdy quite late. Motor bikes are constantly driving by. Up the road there is a club which pumps music till the early hours of the morning. This club was open every night we were there (10 days), so it is not just a weekend thing. Once the pub and club noise have died down (around 4 in the morning), the Italian restaurant across the road has its deliveries at around 6am in the morning. The reversing noise from this truck is constant and it will definitely be heard!Last negative. If you are traveling as a pair of two couples sharing an apartment- don't. We moved from a two bedroom 'apartment' to two separate rooms because the rooms were separated by a curtain. You have two options when selecting a two bedroom apartment- either have rooms separated by curtains or have actual walls but have a bathroom only in the master bedroom. This would make it a little awkward going to the toilet in the middle of the night....Honestly, I would stay back at this hotel if they invested in double glazed glass windows. Once we had moved to separate rooms our lack of sleep was the only problem!

I hesitated to believe it possible because our nightly rate here was 30-50% less than the ""specials"" most 2.5 star hotels in Waikiki were advertising. But Aqua Pearl turns out to be a good find.Book direct via their website. You get an additional 12% off the lowest advertised price with their Kamaaina (welcome) rate, and you can request an upgrade for just a few bucks if they have availability. Aqua Pearl is three blocks from the beach, directly through the center of the International Market (which happens to have a U.S. Post Office branch, fyi). It's also half block from the east edge of the tourist shopping and restaurant district, which is perfect because you can sleep at night removed from the noise. You can get anywhere on the island via the local bus service for $2.50. The bus stop is 1/2 block from the hotel so you don't need to rent a car, which saves lots of money on daily parking fees.Almost all of Waikiki's hotel construction is from the 1950s-60s, so everything is either old, renovated, or torn down and rebuilt. Aqua Pearl is in the renovated category. Now in our fourth night, after twice extending our stay, we find our room very satisfactory. We did get the upgrade to a junior king suite. The room is huge, with minimal furnishings. Though we've had our suitcases strewn all over the floor all week (because we didn't unpack thinking we might move) there's still more than enough room to bring the patio table and chairs from the balcony inside, so you can dine in air conditioning.The junior king room comes with a microwave and mini-refridge, which are both important if you can't bear to eat restaurant food every meal. We found a grocery store in Honolulu and stocked up on fresh fruit and veggies, yogurt, green tea, organic half & half, etc. The room has a coffee maker, but you need to bring your own cream, as only the powdered kind is provided. Toiletries provided are shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and bar soap. (No idea why every hotel on the planet doesn't provide body wash instead of goopy soap.)There is no pool or fitness center, but you can get a discount pass at 24 Hour Fitness (about 4 blocks away) if you're staying at one of the Aqua properties.The front desk staff and housekeeping staff are very friendly and accommodating. I really like the chilled watermelon water available in the lobby all day.The king bed is very comfortable, as are the pillows. Blankets aren't necessary here, and you can sleep with your balcony door wide open weeknights when it's quiet. There are literally no bugs !We have an astonishing view from our eighth floor room of Waikiki city lights after sundown. The balcony is enormous and it's very pleasant to enjoy a cup of coffee outside as the sun is rising. The bathroom has been renovated with granite counter, shower/tub enclosure, and a pretty mirror. The hotel skimps on bath towels (two per day), but that's understandable because I'd guess that guests take them to the beach and lose them or ruin them. I love the full length mirrors on the double closet doors in the bedroom. The flat screen TV is only about 27"" so you can't see it from across the room (no watching TV in bed), but then who comes to Hawaii to watch TV ? Our only complaint is the free Wi-Fi. It's difficult to impossible to get connected, and then if you do find a connection, browsing is approx. the speed of dial-up. No exaggeration. So forget hotel Wi-Fi. Starbucks is 1/2 block away, and if that one happens to be crowded, there's a second Starbucks one block north. I don't hesitate to recommend this hotel for people traveling on a budget.

The rooms have a fridge and micro wave which is good and bad... A lot of guests bring in take away food which is not making the rooms any cleaner I guess...I had a standard room which means view to another building with plenty of windows meaning you have to keep the curtains closed day and night and yes, the airco is loud... To give you an idea, the airco prevents you from hearing the tv unless you turn it up significantly.... Make sure you tip the cleaning lady daily. if not, the number of towels, replacement of soap, etc are reduced to a minimum. Also it seems that a lot of rooms are occupied by 4 people, plenty of them making a lot of noise in the hall way in the evening and night....If you are looking for a cheap(er) decent and good place to stay in central Waikiki, this is your hotel.","London, United Kingdom","Globe_trot_traveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",110,4.0

We were also informed of complimentary beach towels to use at the beach. The beach was only a few blocks away and the location of the hotel was right in the middle of Waikiki.

You also get free wifi in your rooms which not many of the other hotels in Waikiki have.

One is the parking - the lack of actually. They have limited parking that is by the hotel. If you arrive too late in the day, you have to park in their overflow parking which is about a 5 minute walk away. Paying $23 a night for parking, I'd expect to have parking at the hotel, which was not the case 3 of the 6 nights we stayed at the hotel. The second is the air conditioning. The air conditioning worked fine and would keep the room very fresh, but it was extremely noisy.

That's at least three different owners and half a dozen friends and colleagues -- all of whom loved it. It is still the first hotel we contact when planning a trip. As a flight attendant, I stay in lots of hotels and I often travel for pleasure to Waikiki at the last minute. (It's my husband's favorite place on earth.) The staff at the Pearl has always been accommodating. The addition of an ice machine and vending area is a real improvement. The rooms have a microwave and small frig (great for bringing back the leftovers from the oversized portions common in Waikiki restaurants). Coffee packets are complementary (many hotels in Waikiki charge you for them) and were refreshed generously for us every day. There is someone at the front desk 24/7. Our check in and check out were very fast and the cab they called for our trip back to the airport was there in two minutes. Free newspapers and entertainment guides are available in the lobby every day. One improvement is that this pet-friendly hotel is apparently policing pet owners a bit more stringently. We saw NO pet souvenirs anywhere around the hotel, as we often notice with consternation at other pet-friendly hotels. Internet was fast and free and we had no problems accessing it in our room and even on our balcony. Pillows and linens were crisp and lovely and room was very clean. With a family of three, I appreciate the bigger bathroom. Location is key in Waikiki. At the Pearl you will find a Starbucks so close that it might as well be in the lobby. (Bring a loaded Starbucks card and it's way fast.) A mini-mart is right across the street, well-stocked with beer, wine, liquor and all kinds of sundries, and at reasonable prices. It's literally a few steps across one street and you are at the International Marketplace and then across one more street and you are on the beachfront and in the middle of all that Waikiki offers in the way of restaurants and shopping and hotels. I read that one person found the hotel noisy. I do not find the Pearl any noisier than any other hotel I've stayed at in Waikiki, and less noisy than most. We've probably stayed in half a dozen over the years when the Pearl was full or when my husband was attending a conference hosted at a particular hotel. They were all more expensive than the Pearl, and many not as nice as the Pearl -- noise aside. People who have never been to Waikiki before are often shocked that it IS an urban environment, with all the activity that this entails. If you want absolute peace and quiet, go to the North Shore or Maui or ask for a room facing the canal. Waikiki is more like the Vegas strip or Times Square -- it's full of action and that's what my husband loves about it. While it's unfair to include them in a review of the hotel, I have to mention that the very casual taco place just on the corner (near the Subway sandwich place) made my son a fabulous quesadilla, cheap and fast, and the St. Germain bakery made wonderful spinach quiche along with sweets for breakfast, at a very reasonable price. Some other places we love to eat include Ruffage (the best tuna sandwiches in the world), Cheeseburgers in Paradise (although we prefer the location on Beach Walk, as it is a little less rowdy), California Pizza Kitchen, the Oceanarium at the Pacific Beach Hotel (pricey but worth it, especially with a group when you are VERY hungry) and, of course, our favorite, Duke's Canoe Club.","Clemson, SC","ToniVitanza</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clemson, SC</strong>",68,5.0

I like free Wi-Fi access in the room and the free Apple computer at the lobby for everyone to use. The only cons I found are the hotel is quite noisy in early morning due to the garbage pickup trucks even though my room was on 8th floor. There are limit parking space and they charge $23/day and they don't have a pool. I myself prefer the beach than the pool. Overall, my family really enjoyed our time at Aqua Pearl. If you're looking for a luxury hotel, then Aqua Pearl is not for you. If you're looking for clean hotel, comfortable bed in a central location, then you should try Aqua Pearl out. I definitely return to Aqua Pearl for my next trip to Oahu.",Canada,"NguyenFamily</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",2,4.0

The hotel is located in downtown Honolulu about a 10 minute walk to Waikiki beach. Parking was sparse, only about 20 spaces but we managed to get a spot each evening. Yea the area is lively and a bit loud but it is downtown Honolulu and there is a bar that is adjacent to the hotel. We stayed on the 6th floor. Rooms were clean but not big. The television was rather small. There was an IHOP about 12 minutes away for breakfast. Each room has a large window probably 6x9 feet. As we were walking to our room around midnight on the first night after a 12 hour flight, we walked by a room that had the drapes open wide. There was a young couple having sex on he bed. Oh well, kids on vacation which was not really the fault of the hotel. What happened next was a little troubling. On the second day after returning from breakfast, we discovered that our son's laptop was missing from the room. We immediately notified the front desk and we later filed a report with the Honolulu police. The staff was helpful in the matter but denied that it would have been any them who took the laptop. Did we accidently leave the door ajar? Did someone from the hotel take it? Was it taken by a professional thief? We probably will never know what happened. Our son is presently working with the hotel's insurance company on the matter. In all fairness to the hotel, other than the 2 incidents just described, we were happy with the hotel and its accomadations.

It is one block from Waikiki Beach, less than 50 metres from the International Market Place, Starbucks is on the corner and restaurants and shops are close by.We received an upgrade before arrival to a Junior Suite which was quite a big room with a balcony (facing other apartment blocks and a laneway) on the 8th floor. The room was rather dated and basic. There was a king and queen bed, one bedside table, desk and one chair (for 2 guests?) though there were 2 chairs and a table on the balcony, a TV, microwave, mini fridge and coffee maker. The lighting was quite poor and dim, room being lit only by lamps. The air conditioner was quiet and worked well over the 3 nights we spent here. The bathroom was in need of maintenance... fixtures loose or missing and the shower head rather rusty with restricted water flow. We liked the comfortable bed providing a good night's sleep, the free wi-fi and being on the 8th floor it was quiet. We never had to wait very long for the lifts to the ground floor and the water dispenser with watermelon in it in the lobby was refreshing. The front desk staff polite and service was acceptable, nothing especially praiseworthy like other reviewers have noted.We didn't like the lack of cleanliness and lack of servicing of the room. This is what let the hotel down for us. On first arrival in the early evening, our room was ready and appeared clean as you would expect, but closer inspection revealed a different story. The carpeting was stained and the bathroom tiled floor was tacky/sticky with residue from not being properly cleaned and rinsed. It stayed this way for the duration of our stay. For the next 2 days, our room was never serviced/cleaned before 2pm and one day well after 3.30pm. This is unacceptable. After doing a morning hike to Diamond Head, we came back around lunchtime for a shower to an unserviced room and therefore had to re-use our wet, dirty towels. After going and coming a number of times from our room, we mentioned that our room hadn't been serviced and were told, ""yes, the staff were in a meeting"". Maybe they ran out of time because when the room was eventually serviced the only evidence was clean towels. Toiletries were not replenished, hair, dirt and a rubber band that had been on the floor since our arrival were still there. Everything in the room was as we had left it/moved it and the rubber bath mat, instead of being rolled back up and placed on the side of the bath like when we arrived, was still in the bottom of the bath indicating the bath had not been cleaned... that and the suds still on the tiled wall were a dead giveaway. Also as a previous reviewer noted, there was a bit of a problem with bugs in the room, especially the bathroom. When we were using the bathroom, we could also hear the neighbours in their bathroom through the vent in the common wall.Would we recommend or stay again in this hotel?... I don't think so. We will accept a dated and basic room, we will accept a little time delay, but we will never accept poor attention to detail and uncleanliness. This could've been a more pleasant stay had the hotel got their act together!","Sydney, Australia","ForeverYoung50</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",347,3.0

Just looking at Aussieliv's review -- I think it's fair to say that it probably doesn't matter where you are at night there are going to be shady characters, we actually walked up to the beach at night because my daughter thought she left her camera there - and there are ""characters"" at the beach too - but during the day these ""characters"" are nowhere to be seen, more specifically if you want to spend $400-$500 / night then stay at a five star hotel - if you are interested in a clean room that has housekeeping done to it daily (fresh towels, beds made etc.) and close to the beach and still want to have some money in your pocket for other things - then this is a good place to be. We spent our entire day out and about and only came back at night to sleep, a plus was we asked for beach towels at the front desk each day - so it was nice not to have to pack beach towels !

It gets super loud at night since there's many bars around and for some reason, Harley riders loved going down this street at night and gunning it for everybody to hear(and feel) them zoom by. Incredibly annoying. Just be prepared.My other big gripe is what most other people already brought up. The elevators. First off, there was only 1 working for nearly our entire stay and its SLOW and SMALL. It amused me they had a sign that said they are ""modernizing"" the elevators. WTF is modernizing? haha It certainly didn't include making them faster or more efficient. I noticed they fitted new buttons and decor but Id rather have faster elevators than fancy buttons. So one busy morning we waited about 10 min for the elevator to go down and twice when it got to our floor(4th) it was already full so we said the hell with it and I folded up my son's stroller and we walked it down the stairs. Needless to say, I was irritated already.The lobby has a nice modern(ized) feel but its a little deceiving since the rest of the hotel isn't as updated. Don't let the lobby fool you!The standard rooms were quite large but what I didn't get was why there was only 1 chair in the entire room at the desk. No bench, no sitting chair so you either sat on that one chair or on the bed. And this goes for the balcony too. Nice big table but only ONE chair? Who's bright idea was that? I understand the view isn't the best but couples will occasonally sit and have soem coffee or eat a malasada outside and if there's only 1 chair outside its useless.Last but not least has again to do with the noise. We weren't able to get a room that didn't face the street so the sliding door was shut at night. However, our room had a HUGE crack on one end of the window where the frame of the sliding door meets with the wall and not only warm air came thru but sound as well! I should've taken a picture of that it was so appalling. They can put granite counter tops in the bathroom, put in a flat screen tv, but you can't renovate the sliding doors? Not cool.The sole reason I'm not giving this place a 1 star rating is the value for the money and its centralized location. The complimentary taro and sweet rolls, and muffins, coffee, tea in the morning is nice as well. I'm usually not a harsh critic but had to expose this place for what it really is in hopes that mgmt will fix these glaring issues.","San Jose, California","crossphaded</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",17,2.0

We chose the Hawaii package, since going to Hawaii had been high on our ""bucket list"" for some time. The cruise was a seven-day cruise on Norwegian Cruise Line of the other three islands; and that was a fantastic experience. However, the resort was a different experience. We were supposed to get a seven-day resort stay also, but there was only one resort that they had in their program; and that was on one of the other islands. After considerable negotiating with RCI, they gave us four days stay in the Wyndham Royal Gardens. It was nice, but not in a very convenient location; and they would not give us the two extra nights we needed prior to boarding the cruise ship. We were looking for an alternate place to stay for those two nights, and we asked one of our tour bus drivers for a recommendation. He said, ""you mean an affordable place"", and I said, ""that is exactly what we want"". He recommended the Waikiki Aqua Pearl, which was located about eight blocks from where we were staying, located in the middle of good restaurants, shopping; and less than two blocks from the Waikiki Beach. It is a basic small hotel, very clean, excellent service, courteous staff, and only $116 per night in Waikiki. They did not have a restaurant, but there is a good selection of restaurants within easy walking distance from the hotel. We stayed the two nights prior to starting the cruise, plus one night following the cruise to take advantage of a better price on our flight from Honolulu to Milwaukee.

The Waikiki Pearl is one of their budget properties, so I wasn't expecting something grand like the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The Good: staff is friendly, accommodating and professional. I asked for an upgraded room and it was quickly cleaned and made available for me. I also liked the lobby snacks, free wi-fi and close parking.On the flip side, the hotel is old and small, with virtually no lobby and certainly no curb appeal. But then, you usually pay for that in the cost of your room, so I didn't expect it and didn't care. I'd rather have a frumpy lobby and a courteous and kind staff (which was the case), than a grand foyer with an aloof and uncaring reception (had that before, but NOT at an Aqua hotel). One of the two elevators was out of order, which made getting up to the 7th floor onerous. These things happen. Forced us to slow down and chat with the other tourists.The room we had was HUGE (a one bedroom suite). Balcony views are quite unexceptional as they look down on some ratty apartments, but it's still Hawaii and it's always fun to people watch in Waikiki (especially the residents!)I would say the hotel is conveniently located, but I cannot think of a hotel in Waikiki that is not so (except maybe the Hilton Hawaiian Village, which is a destination unto itself). Really, pretty much everything is within walking distance.Arg, they charge $23 per day to park. Going rate, I'm afraid. Not unique to this property.Overall, I got what I was expecting, which was a solid, basic hotel. The only reason I would not stay at this particular hotel again is because, by the time I paid for the upgrade, I could have chosen a slightly more upscale Aqua property and been a little happier.

The price was so reasonable for the area. The facility has no pool or spa but spending time on the beach was more important.The air conditioning was amazingly quiet for a hotel. The room size was very large. I would recommend requesting a high floor to get farther away from the street noise. The higher floor allowed us to have a partial view of the ocean when we leaned out from our lanai as well. The street noise is loud as the hotel is just off of Kuhio, a very busy street in Waikiki and the trash was picked up early every morning. It is a nonsmoking facility. There is a little bar adjacent to the hotel. We had fun playing darts and drinking $3 mai tais there.

(We arrived at 2 a.m. so no housekeepers were there at that hour.) One day we didn't get fresh glasses or paper replensihments, but that was remedied quickly. One elevator was being refurbished, which left one elevator operating for the entire hotel and that made for a bit of a wait. They had snacks for the ""winter season"", but the rolls for breakfast were nasty. The afternoon snack was good. Good things: We received fresh towels everyday, even though we were willing to reuse them. There are fast food places close, so it is not necessary to spend high prices on food. A grocery store is just around the corner. It was easily accessible to catch the bus, trolleys or any tour buses. The staff was super friendly and helpful.

Dont get me wrong, the first time i went i had a great time, the room was fantastic and the staff were great, my review last time was a 4 out of 5. This time i would say that it surpasses that. If there were more stars to add i would have added a couple more.This time round - from the moment i stepped off my shuttle bus at the curb to have someone from the front desk waiting to take my suitcase from me was fantastic, especially for a hotel that is not a luxury rated. The gentlemen at the front desk was so friendly and helpful with everything i needed to accommodate me. Again like last time i was upgraded to a 2brm apartment. Love these people.. It was great. The bathroom is massive, the bedrooms are grand, and the living area and kitchen is very generous. I got a different styled 2brm apartment than i did last time, and the balcony was large.Everytime i would leave the hotel and walk past the front desk, i would stop and have a chat to the men if they were not serving anyone - always friendly.. one of the great things i love about staying at Aqua properties. And it is one of the main reasons i will keep coming back.Now what most people need to know is that the hotel is not on the beach, or the next street down, but is actually closer to the canal. However, if you have never been to Honolulu than here is a tip - Honolulu area of waikiki beach is not that big, this hotel is only about a 3-5min walk through the international market place alley to waikiki beach. Only 2 mins from the international marketplace itself. And if you are looking for a hotel with an apartment than you wont find these on the beach anyway. To end all i can say is thankyou to the team at the front desk for my upgrade from a standard room to a 2brm apartment, thankyou for your friendlyness that always made my day, and thankyou for always having a clean hotel with great service.THANKYOU.",sydney,"yetti</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>sydney</strong>",58,5.0

According to the front desk, there were no rooms available other than the one we had on the 2nd floor facing the street. The room was very large, but no other furniture except a desk and desk chair. There was a table and 2 chairs on the balcony where you could sit if you wanted to hear the traffic noise even better. The room smelled funny. PROS: The air conditioner was newer so was very quiet. We did get a very good rate--$321 for 3 nights using the AARP discount and the hotel was located in a very convenient area--across the street from the International Marketplace and various restaurants. CONS: The room smelled like a wet dog (maybe previous tennant?); no other furniture to sit on; coffee pot didn't work and the warming plate was all rusted; I did talk to the front desk about this but nothing was done. There are two elevators--only one worked the entire three days we were there so I guess it was a good thing we were on the second floor. Bottom line--would I stay here again? NO.

It was great. We travelled with my parents and two teenage sons (there were 6 of us in total). The kitchen was adequate with a large fridge, two hot plates and a microwave oven. There was only enough plates and cutlery for four so we mentioned this when we were heading out on the first morning. When we returned the additional cutlery and plates were stacked neatly on the kitchen bench. Our room was serviced everyday with fresh towels, bins emptied and our beds remade. The cleaning ladies were always friendly and when we were leaving on the last day at 6am in the morning they were just arriving for work and came across to say goodbye to us. The front desk staff in particular Harry and Jamar who gave us the best breakfast cereal tips were always friendly and helpful. The Aqua Pearl is located right in the heart of things just across from the International Markets a quick short cut through to the main shopping strip. Starbucks is located right next door and good for the morning pick me up with the Food Pantry just on the next block for all your food supplies. The trolley and bus stops are also just around the corner. We stayed in Waikiki two years ago at the Ohana Waikiki West and if we had to chose again we would definitely pick the Aqua Waikiki Pearl for value for money and the spaciousness of the rooms, it was also really quiet compared to the Ohana West which is just around the corner on Kuhio Street.

We settled on the Pearl based on need for a kitchen and a separate bedroom - and the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. All the other reviews are totally accurate. It is well located, but in a busy area that can be noisy at night - there's a sports bar right next to the hotel lobby. We saw lots of folks walking down Nahua Street at night and it seemed to be a very safe area. As mentioned, we stayed in a 1 bedroom suite with a full kitchen and it was a VERY large room. The living room was remarkably under furnished - I suppose to have enough space to pull out the sofa bed (?), but the atmosphere certainly would've been improved by even a coffee or side table to place a beverage on. The kitchen was fairly well equipped (we did buy a non-stick frying pan of our own as the room's wasn't the greatest) and we ate breakfast on the balcony almost every morning. The balcony was nothing to scream about - pretty basic, table and a few chairs. A small love seat would've been very welcome! The bathroom was fine (although the soap dish in the shower appeared to have been fastened with caulk, which was coming loose), the beds/pillows were quite comfy and the air conditioning was not excessively loud and kept the rooms quite cold (there were two units - 1 in the bedroom and another in the living room area). A number of reviewers have commented that the room was clean; which I would agree with...to a point. At the beginning of our stay, the room was spotless, but became less so over the 7 days we stayed. By day 5 I really wished there was a mop so I could give the tile kitchen floor a good going over. I am unsure as to whether the room was vacuumed every day and the balcony certainly was NOT swept for sand. That being said, it wasn't bad enough for us to complain about. As mentioned several times, one elevator was out of service and nobody seemed to be getting around to it, but we made the most of it and used the stairs most of the time we were there. The front desk staff was helpful with directions and beach towels; but with such a basic hotel (pretty much no special amenities; not even a pool) I wouldn't say the front desk service went above and beyond. They were simply nice people. We travelled with a nine year old child and he thought the Pearl was the greatest hotel he'd ever been to...even with no swimming pool! I think it's because the staff were kind to him and he enjoyed going to the lobby in the mornings to get some fruit to bring up to the room. Some notes on food: The continental breakfast offered by the hotel was pretty weak - grapes, what looked like really sugary mini-muffins and coffee pretty much every day. Having a kitchen, we made our own breakfasts, thankfully! Starbucks was on the corner and Food Pantry grocery was just a block over. We had a Hula Dog for lunch one day (just at the corner of Nahua and Kuhio in the International Market) - they were interesting for a change, but not something I'd eat every day (vegetarians note: you can get a veggie dog option there and they are cooked separately from the meat dogs - yay!). We really enjoyed the Veggie Star restaurant, which is right next door to the hotel, as well as it's sister restaurant Ruffage, which is closer to the Aqua Bamboo. They served great smoothies, a delicious vegan burger with avocado, and really tasty rice bowls (I had a yummy vegetarian one, my husband had a curried chicken and they were great!). We took a long walk to Bogart's Cafe (near the zoo) which is a very popular place (cash only!), very hard to find a table, but once we did we enjoyed yummy breakfasts and I experienced my first Acai bowl. They also had lots of options for vegetarians.","Winnipeg, Canada","pumpkin049</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winnipeg, Canada</strong>",26,3.0

Our ""junior suite"" was basically just a big standard room. There was still just a bed and desk/tv but with a lot of open space. Still, for the price, totally worth it. It is in a great location. You won't get any views of the ocean but you are only about a 5 minute walk from Duke's and the Waikiki beaches. As long as you are not expecting a posh resort, I think you will be satisfied with Pearl. I would equate the hotel accommodations to a Days Inn style hotel in the mainland. It's Hawaii so you are paying for location. This is in a great location. It was a bit noisy at night but again, we picked this hotel to have a nice bed to sleep off a night of partying in the city.

As we ate out a lot and went sightseeing the hotel was perfect, great size (2 bedroom apartment) comfortable beds, kitchen facilities good ( no wine glasses but can buy at supermarket) great internet service in room. Bus stop about 2 mins walk for the local shuttle buses.All the staff extremely helpful and accommodating would highly recommend this hotel to all families wishing to stay in a affordable and comfortable hotel. Great coffee shop "" Hawaiian Gold ""( not a chain coffee shop) up the road heading to the Zoo around 5 mins walk . TIPS Keep away from the ATM located around the island stick with the ATM at the major banks. Had my credit card scanned, and subsequently stopped as a result. Plus they dispense more cash depending which bank you chose up to $400.00. Best shopping for Surf clothes is up on the North Shore cheaper by up to 10-15%( compared to Ala Moana or the shops in Waikiki) on most items plenty of choice take your time to walk around and have a look. Best shopping in general according to my wife,kids (and Credit Card ) is Ala Moana. Try Matsomoto's on the North Shore for shaved ice, Giovanni's shrimp truck for a great meal, PF Changs and also Tanaka on Tokyo ( easier if you book a table) in Waikiki. If from Australia don't rely on getting cash out at shops as we do here.Could not find one that gave cash out with purchases next time i go will look at getting all my cash in American dollars before leaving.We used Virgin from Perth and Jetstar from Sydney had no issues at all with these airlines and will use again recommend getting extra luggage for 1 person and also pre pay for IPads on Jetstar flight.Weather was great as not too hot was coming into there winter season just perfect lived in shorts and t shirt whole trip.","Busselton, Australia","BrianR144</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Busselton, Australia</strong>",5,4.0

This is by no means a luxury stay but good enough to get a good night's sleep to recharge and go out. My parents and my sister decided to do the 2 bedroom suite with the kitchen. Only one bathroom situated ensuite one of the bedrooms which makes it highly inconvenient for everyone. I wonder why they didn't design the one bathroom to be located in the common area of the suite. It would be much more practical for everyone. The living room area was huge with couchd and tv. Kitchen was functioning with fridge and stove but looked a bit tired. What I did like about this place was location. Around the corner was a noodle shop lined out the door where I can get authentic Japanese hot meal for under $5 and is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 2 blocks or so to Waikiki Beach. Very close to bus stops to Hanauma and Ala Moana. Also, front desk is extremely helpful and friendly and so was the concierge who helped us book tours.There is a computer station located in the front lobby for general use and Wi-Fi is in main lobby only.","Calgary, Canada","JY_Globetrotter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",194,4.0

Just couple blocks from the Waikiki beach, and very well located to the main restaurants area. There is a Starbucks coffee shop at the corner, a Food Pantry market one block away (to the left after the Starbucks) where we used to buy water bottles, juices and some snacks to bring with us during the day trips and to keep us up during the day actvities, if you have the opportunity try the brownie bittes, really delicious! If you like, inside the market there is a little japanese food shop, where we had some awsome oniguiris (or musubis), like the grilled salmon, that you can also take out as a snack. The ""the bus"" stop to Alamoana / Downtown area is very near as well and it is almost in front of the famous Udon japanese restaurant, always crowded due to its very good food and cheap prices. We recomend to use ""the bus"" to go wherever you wanna go, just do a little plan using the web site or google maps before going out, and always remember to get you ""transfer ticket"" that allows you to use ""the bus"" again for free during couple hours (or some hours more) at the same day.We recomend Aqua Waikiki to everyone!","Sao Paulo, SP","Ginger_Up</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sao Paulo, SP</strong>",18,4.0

The staff is friendly and accommodating. Booked a queen/double room for a week and was given a two twin bed room. Staff was happy to change to the queen/double. Apparently all rooms are not created equal as we had a small room and many others have reported how large their rooms were. We caught glimpses into other rooms confirming ours was much smaller. Our room was on the third floor on the parking lot side vs the street side and it did seem a bit quieter. A/C is a wall-mounted unit and does run loud. Didn't bother our sleep though. There were regular outside sounds from being in a big city but almost no noise from other rooms which was nice. There was a closet but no true dresser (desk drawers could serve as a dresser...) for unpacking clothes. Tough to live out of a suitcase when visiting for a week or more.Again, the staff was very pleasant and accommodating.

This place stands out in my memory as one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. First of all, when I made the booking I asked if the hotel had parking because I knew my family members wanted to rent a car. They told me that parking was available. When we arrived, we were told that the parking was unavailable and were directed to park at a neighboring hotel. (A very shady place, where the parking attendants happened to be running a scam.)The hotel room was huge but there was only a small couch to sit on. It was kind of like hanging out in an unfurnished apartment. There was no maid service during our stay at all. On the second day, we came back to hotel to find ourselves locked out of the room by the hotel staff. It was an hour long run around until we finally found out that they had booked somebody else into the room at a higher price and wanted to ""down grade"" us to another room in the hotel. They would not let us enter our room until we agreed to clear out our stuff so their other guests could move in. When we saw the room they wanted to put us in, which smelled weird, didn't have a balcony or enough beds to sleep everyone in our party, we decided to check out of the hotel instead.

The experience at the pearl was amazing. The room was comfortable and relaxing. The staff made me feel at home, Tasi the Hotel manager at the pearl always handled and answered all my questions and concerns. She made sure that my stay was a awesome and confortable stay. She also took the time to make sure that as a tourist I was enjoying my stay and also advised me of all the wonderful things I was able to do in Waikiki. I took her advice and I had a wonderful experience. I also got to get to know some of the staff as I stood at the pearl, Rachel was one of them and she was awesome, always asking how my stay is going and also took the time to remind me there were offers and great ways to explore Waikiki Hawaii. She also always made sure that my room was up to standard and if I had any questions for anything or needed any help for anything all I had to do was make a call. Along with getting to know Rachel and Tasi I also got to know Harry and Dexter they were also very nice and helpful knew how to handle everyone approaching the desk with many different questions and concerns. The Aqua Waikiki Pearl is at a very convenient and wonderful location, a 5-10 min walk from Waikiki beach and in the center of the downtown area. The hotel has the accomidations of tours to take to explore hawaii and shuttles to get you to the airport along with many other exciting activities to chose from to enjoy your ultimate hawaiian get away! This was my first time staying at the Aqua Waikiki pearl and I am looking forward to my next stay there, it will for sure not be my last time staying there the experience and the staff including the Manager Tasi were wonderful and I am deffinately going back to the Aqua waikiki Pearl!!! :) ~Cristal Marin~ ;)","Carson, California, United States","CristalMarin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carson, California, United States</strong>",0,5.0

It was clean although the area around the hotel did not seem like the safest at night, although it may just be a bit seedy as opposed to dangerous.My review is really about the service at the hotel, which more than made up for the hotel itself. In particular, Dexter was so helpful and accommodating to our large group of close to 30 people, and did whatever he could to get us all settled in. He also helped with restaurants, transportation to Pearl Harbor, and transportation to the cruise ship.

The staff is amazing and treats you like one of the family. Everytime we walked through the lobby we received a greeting or comment about how our day was, etc... Our room was clean and spacious. We are a family of four and we have stayed in many hotels where we are stepping all over each other because the rooms are tiny. That was not the case at the AWP, we were super comfortable in our room. The fridge, micro and coffe maker were very convenient and helped save money. The hotel's location could not have been more optimal. We were steps away from the International Market Place, minutes away from the beach and surrounded by ABC stores and places to eat. The parking spaces are minimal but for the two days we did have a car we had no trouble finding a spot in the parking lot. I can't say enough good things about our stay at the AWP. We are planning a return visit to Oahu next summer and will definitely be staying here again. ",,SJC007,12,5.0

We had no issues with our reservation or getting into our room. Great location. You are right across the street from the International Marketplace, which made us feel like we were in the heart of Waikiki. A couple of blocks from the beach. Starbucks (not that good) within steps and ABC stores, for incidentals, every half block. Room was fairly clean and was good sized, with outside entrance. Microwave, refrigerator and safe were nice extras. The main complaint was noise, or to be more specific, closing of doors. When the neighbors closed their doors, it seemed to be inches from you and shake the entire room. We were awakened several times during our stay with the sound of shutting doors. We didn't really hear people in their rooms and didn't hear a ton of external noises (except for the doors) until 5:30 or 6:00am. For those who value watching TV on vacation (just saying), this is not the place. Elevators were slow. We were on the 3rd floor so just took the steps most of the time. The Pearl is fine for what it is. It is a budget hotel in a great location. We chose to spend our money on skydiving rather than on a nicer hotel and the Pearl certainly served that purpose.

They were there waiting for us and it went without a hitch. The hotel is in such a great location! just a short walk to the beach and the international market place is literally across the street. starbucks is on the corner and legonds is a bar attatched.. have a mai tai!Our room wasn't ready as we were quite early but they checked our bags and we went to get some lunch. worked out just fine for us.. since we were pretty hungry.on our return to the hotel they apologized that the room was stilll being cleaned, and it would be about 15 min. so that not being a problem we found the perfect opportunity to speak with the consierge Sarah Beth. WHO IS AWESOME!! she was able to book us everything we wanted to do and we didnt have to omit ANYTHING!! She combined a few things and made it as simple and easy breazy as possible. she also gave us information about the japanese lantern lighting ceremony that they do annualy which was an amazing thing to experience on memorial day. after we finnished up our tours ( which I totally recommend you do the day you get there so you can fit in everything you want to do) we were handed our keys and off to the room we went we had the Jr suite which was a great size room for 3 ladies it had a balcony and fridge counter top and microwave. Very clean rooms and beds. only a few stains on the carpets, but those were minor. the next morning we were greeted by a smilig staff and an aloha.. every time you come and go they say hello and tell you to enjoy your day or evening. Jamar was a delight. he took care of us anytime we needed somethig, recommendations on dining, or needing a cab. always a delight, he even broght us some Leonards doughnuts a local yummy treat.. We brought him and Sara Beth a doughnut the day before from another bakery we found , just for being so nice.. and we get a box of doughnuts filled with guava and coconut and chocolate.. i forget the name of the doughnut but they were delightful. I have stayed at many hotels across the world and the Staff at this hotel by far is the most amazing staff I have ever come across, I cant remember everyones names but seriously EVERYONE we came into contact with at this hotel was just the most polite and professional people they all deserve something extra..

Most of the hotels in the neighborhood were significantly more expensive like $60-$380 more per night on the weekend! wow! We were here to celebrate my birthday with family and friends. We didn't want to stay at some high end hotel nor some grungy place we never heard of. First of all the hotel is a little hard to find, but that was okay, we figured it out in less than ""two shakes"". Parking is right there on the property and I liked the fact that I could see my car and not have to walk over a mile like some hotels just to get to it. Parking is first come first to park, so we just left our car there the whole time because we could walk or take a cab to everywhere in Waikiki. I heard that they have other places to park also at their sister properties. Check in was super fast, got some coupons and a free newspaper, that was cool. The girl checking me in ( I think her name was Tracy) saw that today was my birthday and upgraded me to a one bedroom suite, that was the the best thing I could have asked for! Sweetness!! When we got upstairs and I thought holy smokes this room is just way too big for us! I mean the room was so big that if you stood in the middle of the hallway and talked, your voice actually echoed, this room was so big that you could probably fit 40 people in there for a party and they could all sleep over. There was a full kitchen and even ice in the freezer. About 1/2 hour after we got in to the room Tracy called to see if we liked the room and if there was anything else that we needed, I thought that that was a nice touch. The room was clean and the pool and Jacuzzi was right across the street. The free stuff included cable, 2 flat screen tvs with remote, coffee, internet ( most places nowadays that's not included) it was pretty fast we watched some streaming movies. The locations is right in the middle of Waikiki so everything is about 5 minutes away or less ( if you are a fast walker like me) ; convenience store, restaurants, night clubs, shops, theater and the beach. The next day I saw that some of the other people staying here had dogs, hmm, if I had known this was a pet friendly hotel I would have brought mine, come to think of it my room didn't smell of pets. I guess that house keeping does a pretty good job if that's the case. I called them for more pillows, I like me a lot of pillows. We caught a cab to go to dinner, I was worried that we would have to wait a while, but the cab was waiting for us when we got down stairs, super convenient. We hit the late night, night life and man let me tell you, I loved the idea of having to walk just 5 minutes to my room. Ya, I liked the balcony too, got a small tan and the view was really nice. The next day, I asked for a late check out and they said it was no problem, that won me over, I am definitely recommending this place and we would absolutely stay here again.","Waipahu, Hawaii, United States","Daniel P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waipahu, Hawaii, United States</strong>",5,4.0

I had a couple of issues upon check in(missing remote, internet), but they were resolved immediately. Front desk and bellman were always friendly and helpful. I felt this was a good value for my business trip. The only negative was the limited parking. I'm not sure I would recommend for someone who will have a car the for the whole trip. To be fair, I was always able to park on site, but there was always some stress when returning with hoping that I would'nt have to park off site. Since I was there on business, I would leave and return a few times throughout the day. In comparison to the Island Colony, I would say the Island Colony is better for longers stays and families due to the larger amount of ammenties that it has.

The Aqua Pearl was available at a very nice rate-- which I will admit almost scared us a little. But we HAD to have rooms, so we decided to roll the dice. Hey, we bingoed! The hotel isn't a 5 star resort-- it's a basic hotel. But, we had LARGE clean rooms, comfortable beds with nice linens, and spacious clean bathrooms. A bonus was the refrigerator & microwave. Parking is the pits (as it is almost everywhere in Honolulu) but we lucked out 2 of the 3 nights & got a space at the hotel. The other night we had to park & walk a couple of blocks. Yes, it can be noisy at night because all the tourists on the main drag act like idiots, but that's not the hotel's fault. The bar on the street level that someone referred to was never a problem-- I thought it was pretty quiet. People on the street you can't control, so yes, there was noise there. But the beds were comfortable enough that I slept like a rock once I nodded off. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Aqua Pearl again. Like I said, if you want ""fancy"", this isn't it.... if you want a nice clean room at a decent price with nice staff & in a convenient location, this is a great choice.

The housekeeping staff was always there to tidy up the room and refresh the linens daily. That was SOO greatly appreciated. The unit had a good kitchen unit, along with necessary utensils for preparing a meal. This amenity was a major help in keeping us on budget. We used the laundry room on our last day.

I booked a room at Aqua Waikiki Pearl on Hotels.com. I took a shuttle to the hotel and arrived around 10:30 PM. When I got to the hotel they advised me that hotels.com had made the reservation for the next day and there was nothing they could do about it. I asked them if there was a rate difference they advised me there was not but that they had a strict 72 hour cancellation policy. ( I only needed a place to sleep for 7 hours until I could get onto the next flight. They told they only thing they could do for me is book another night at the same rate. I proceeded to call Hotel.com (which by the way was 100% nicer than the front desk girl at this hotel.) Hotel.com called the hotel and spoke with Chris at the front desk who was nice on the phone to hotels.com but told them they would need to call back and they she needed to talk to her manager. When Chris would call the manager she would say things like I don't think we should waive any cancellation fee etc and was really rude about the whole situation. Being 5 months pregnant I waited and waited to find out the outcome. I just wanted to sleep at this point (almost midnight). The hotel wouldn't budge and so we booked another night. Hotels.com called and offered to cancel the room for the next night at no extra charge and would take on the cancellation fee. I was very impressed. I will use hotels.com again but there is no way I would ever book with this hotel again. As for the room- Both my husband and I got bit by something in the bed I had red marks all over my body the next day. This place is really a motel not a hotel. I barely slept they put us on the second floor and there is club right underneath the room, music was blaring all & rattle the room until 4 am. I could hear people partying and screaming in the streets all night. The beds were extremely hard and room was really dirty.

Upon checking in the staff is pleasant, all rooms clean and spacious. Only downer was the daily room service. For a two bedroom they only had towels for two people. I would assume when they (or if the information) was known that four people were staying, they should have had the proper number of towel sets. That remedied the second day. Third day no service at all. Not even to make the beds. The fourth day they only made the bed, did not change the sheets. SO I had to request the changing of sheets the next day, and in addition, more hand soap. (The soap was given to us on the the 7th day.) Then the sheets were the same for the rest of our stay... Not so horrible, BUT when sand is found in the sheets, its a bit annoying to fix it ourselves. We had 9 days in 808, had a good time, Just could have been a bit better with consistant room service. Hopefully this is not the norm. I think we would stay here again, The value, polite front desk staff and location is great.","Seattle, Washington","KM984</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",5,3.0

When we arrived, there was a HUGE line at the check-in counter. I waited about 15 minutes until I could check in. This was not the fault of the staff--it was just really busy at that particular moment. The lobby is small, but renovated with a contemporary look. There is free wi-fi in the lobby, and a computer is available if you need to use it.I stayed on the second floor, with a view of the TINY parking lot. The room was CLEAN, however, it smelled like mildew, and the bathroom smelled worse. I am guessing there is very poor air ventilation/circulation in the room. Once we had the air conditioner running for a few hours, the smell in the room was hardly noticeable, but the bathroom remained stinky. The staff was very friendly. But one thing that completely BAFFLED me was the housekeeping. Everynight--and I mean EVERYNIGHT--when we returned from the beach there were not enough bath towels in the bathroom. So I would have to call housekeeping to bring up more. There were only 3 of us in the room, so shouldn't we get 3 towels everyday? If you take away 3 dirty towels, shouldn't you replace them with 3 clean towels? One time, many occasions there were only 2 towels. On 2 occasions there were 2 towels, and a hand-towel disguised as a bath towel. On 3 occasions there wasn't a bathmat to step out on to. Now onto the parking. It really sucks. If you get back to the hotel before 4pm, you're probably ok. However, if you get there and there is no parking, you have to go to another parking garage about a block away. I thought this was ok, except when I had to do this on a Friday night with my child. The parking garage is located in the same building as two popular night clubs. When we arrived in the garage there were SO MANY rowdy people I was nervous to leave my car. People were drinking by there cars in the garage, and getting really rowdy. We finally found a parking spot on the 5th floor and had to take the elevator with 5 drunk men and women cursing and openly drinking. . . . while my son was with me!I know that this is not a reflection of the hotel, however, if you have children, are staying over the weekend, and will be driving, having to park in this garage might be an issue for you. The location of this property was decent. I've stayed all over waikiki in the past, but this location was not my favorite due to its proximity to the bars and nightclubs. On the plus side, it is close to starbucks, International market, and lots of restaurants. Another plus is that you can check out beach towels.","Cupertino, California","kandeesj</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cupertino, California</strong>",0,3.0

We stayed in the one bedroom deluxe suite which frankly was stretching it in the deluxe stakes. Its a very tired old hotel which friends told me used to be the cheapest nasiest one in Waikiki but as with all Aquas it has had a tart up and overall furniture/fittings are to a pretty good standard but the aspect from the balconies is really ugly and being a low rise hotel the street noise and bin collection are the ususal pain as with any low rise hotel. We had problems with the bath not holding water and reported it to the front desk who promised to sort it out but when we returned late that night after a very long day nothing had been done. The next morning a manager happened to be present so we spoke to him and fair play he apologised and rang up back quickly to say it couldnt be fixed and we could move to same room type which was ok but a bit annoying given four women shopping in Hawaii we had to spend quite a bit of time and hassle packing bags and also packing a fridge full of food, would have been nice if they offered some help with the move. The next bath did hold water but like the previous room seemed to run out of hot water after one shower so I gave up on the bath all together (quite annoying as it was a big part of my booking that room and I did impress that before making the booking so to have a bath but not be able to have hot water in it was pretty useless. As with all of themthe water pressure and capacity was rubbish. be careful about booking here on a holiday weekend as we had several people partying in the rooms around us who were coming into Waikiki for the thanksgiving long weekend and also the Sat night was a nightmare with myself and one daughter on the sofa bed the noise from the bar underneath the hotel kept us half the night with screaming and car noises. Staff were present and friendly enough but not as helpful with lots of shrugs of the shoulders when we aksed pretty standard tourist questions we gave up and took our advice from shopkeepers in the area. The wifi only worked on the outdoor hallways and in the foyer (dodgy even there). Those are my whinges and I would not stay here again however the location and value (especially for a larger group of people) was good being close to Starbucks, restaurants, the bus stop and supermarket, across the road is the international market and minutes to the beach strip. My advice would be to look at the Aqua Wave which is just across the road on Kuhio, its a high rise so much quieter in the higher floors and although the lift is always slow its great value and the views add to the feeling of being on holiday.",central coast,"deeCentralCoast</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>central coast</strong>",26,4.0

She suggested I drive around and find a metered space on a nearby street and my parking would be free. Luckily, I did find a space one street over. I was a bit nervous about leaving the car, but it ended up being fine. I faced a similar issue the 2nd night and opted to park in a nearby ""lift"" where your car rides up an elevator and gets stored in a warehouse-like parking lot for the night at a charge of $14.When we stepped off the elevator on the way to our room, I was wondering about my decision because the carpets in the open-air hallways were fairly dirty and worn. My concern was put to rest when we arrived in our room to find a recently rennovated and very large room and bathroom. This is an older property to be sure, but it had been nicely redone. All-in-all, I was very happy with my decision. The $ saved by moving here from the Sheraton Waikiki paid for my car rental expense for the entire week.

Good size desk with chair and desk lamp and flat panel tv (a little on the small side - I think about 20"" screen). Off in the corner there was a floor lamp which was all by itself - could have used a nice easy chair in the corner for extra seating (only ""seating"" was beds and desk chair). Two beds with nightstand, clock, and lamp between them. Bathroom was nothing special - clean and had good lighting (I guess - not sure about anyone putting on makeup - probably could have been a little brighter).

The property was fairly quiet (except for doors) - could hear people outside, but not too annoying. The area around the hotel (Kuhio Ave) is busy during the day and evening (and as our rooms faced the interior of the hotel/parking lot) we did not hear much street noise (except for the garbage truck on the other street).

If the purpose is to keep folks from using the computer more than three minutes, the hotel has met its goal admirably. After pulling up my boarding pass, I requested a printed copy. Staff looked at ""Luddite Granny"" with evident impatience and a young woman silently handed me a drive mechanism for the computer.Then she turned away to resume socializing with other front desk staff. It was only after I jammed the drive into the wrong port (unintentionally) that she turned around expressing concern for the computer. The next morning I asked the front desk to get me a cab. It arrived on time but it was a stretch limousine. When I said I wanted a cab, I was hustled toward the ""limo."" Because I had to catch a flight, I ran out of time to order a cab.

We live in Honolulu and had to stay at a hotel for one night because our house was having plumbing problems. It was only one night but several things happened that made our experience unimpressive. First, when I called to make reservations, the woman at the front desk asked if I wanted one or two beds. I said one. She quoted me $85 for a king size bed. I said the price online was less and she said it was actually more. I then realized she didn't offer me the queen size bed which was $74. She was trying to get me to pay more for something I didn't need. How rude of her, especially since I was a local resident and explained to her my dilemma with our plumbing. Second, the room was not the cleanest. The shower had many hairs on the floor and someone's shampoo left from a previous guest. Third, it was 11:30 at night so we wanted to get settled in and sleep. The woman at the front desk was kind of hyper, not warm. We had to call the front desk from the room because there was no remote for the AC. The woman at the front desk kept saying where it should be as if we were not looking hard enough in the small room. She finally sent a security guy up who verified there was no remote. He got us a remote to turn on the AC.Fourth, I went to take a shower and the water pressure was very low and didn't have hot water. I called the front desk and the security guy confirmed the shower wasn't working. We were moved to another room. Oh and we had to take the AC remote with us. Fifth, in the morning, I asked another front desk woman the price of parking and without looking up at me, she gave me a one word answer.

I thought the place was ""just a hotel."" Nothing special. It wasn't the worst place I had ever been but it certainly was not the best.I pre-paid through Priceline. The rate was very reasonable for my budget.The lobby leads you to believe that the hotel is posh and upgraded. There is a MAC computer available for guests' use. Don't be fooled by the nice hardwood flooring and cush lounge chairs. The rest of the hotel is 1987. When I arrived at 230PM, the room was ready. Check-in was very quick. I had a package delivered to me prior to my arrival and it was ready and waiting for me when I checked in. My room was on the 4th floor overlooking the street. If you are looking for a view, go elsewhere. The rooms facing the street look down on dirty Nahua Street. The rooms facing the courtyard get a great view of the hotel's parking lot. My room was decorated poorly but I never care about that. I will admit that the room size was HUGE. I was very surprised by this. I am quite sure that hotel room is larger than the master bedroom in my ""luxury"" apartment back home in DC. I think the room is called a junior suite, or something to that effect. The room has coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator. There is wired internet in the room, free for guests. Overall the room is clean and adequate. I can make no complaints about that. The lighting in the bathroom was a little dim but I realise that the lights had to warm up before they went to their full luminescence. The water pressure was decent; the temperature satisfactory.For some people, the one negative thing will be the noise. I always say that if you are in an urban area, you should get over it. If you want peace and quiet, get a hotel in the woods. There was plenty of street noise at the 4th floor. This hotel goes to the 10th floor. Last year, I stayed on the 17th floor of a property a block away and I could still hear street noise. I live in DC so noise does not bother me. But if you're sensitive, get a room overlooking the ""courtyard."" Less noise, but not entirely quiet because now you have people traipsing back and forth in front of your door. There is a bar adjacent to the building and this has quite a bit of noise until about 4AM. This hotel allows pets and this worried me because I thought there would be dogs barking all night. I didn't see one animal. There is laundry available on the 3rd floor. Bring your own quarters. There is no change machine. Go across the street to the video game place on Kuhio. That's the only place I could find with quarters.The staff was very polite. Every time I saw someone in the hallway they said hello. The front desk people were friendly. You can get beach towels, but bring them back because they charge supposedly charge $35 if you don't. One time I got a towel but they didn't even write my name down, so who knows if they enforce this policy. There was an issue with the phones but I don't use hotel phones. I think they allow free local calls but I can't verify this.Even though this area can be dingy at night, I did feel secure. I came back to the room while it was being serviced and maid did not simply just allow me to walk into the room. She checked my key and my identity before she let me stay. I appreciate this because any lunatic can just walk up into a room where the door is open while it's being cleaned. If you are looking for someplace clean and budget friendly, this is your place. If you are sensitive to noise then look someplace else. If you want cheap and close to everything stay here. If you want posh luxury, keep going.I would stay here again.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","WorfsBabyMama</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",75,3.0

This hotel stood out for cleanliness and location in its price range.I found the room spacious--it was really a one bedroom apartment with full kitchen and living room dining room area plus a spacious balcony. The room had high speed internet service (wired) and we found it fairly quiet from our perch on the 9th floor. The desk staff was very helpful and there was a parking lot that we didn't need or use. There was a sports bar attached to the hotel as well as an ATM and laundry facilities.In terms of location, we were 1/4 block from the Kuhio Avenue strip, 3 - 4 blocks from the beach, 2 blocks from the Food Pantry (supermarket/deli), across the street from the International Market including a Food Court and next door to a Starbucks! There was also a drug/sundry store (ABC), a bakery (St Germaine), a health food eatery, a liquor store and a very popular sushi restaurant within a block of the Aqua Waikiki Pearl.

However, what I heard was that there was a room, 603 or 607 which was finishing cleaning. Also, in his refusal, he also mentioned that we were booked in a cheap fare and gave us an upgrade for extra fee or give a room in lower one. We declined his offer and had a room in a lower one. The room was good but no view and equipped with mircowave.There is one queen and one double in the room. Howevr the internet required a cable insert which was impossible if you had an ipod or ipad.

We had not planned on being in the room much more than just to sleep and we were able to do this in complete comfort two of the three nights.

It is 20$ a day and I dont remember it was mentioned at booking or on the website.The room is spacious and bedding of good quality (except the sofa). It was pretty clean but towels were missing. Same for dishes, cookware and chairs. The table was so small that we moved the outdoor table in. It was a nightmare having meals in this room. Did not have much choice because one of my kids is gluten free.The aircon from the room next door was doing plenty of noise. Watch out: the elevator is dangerous for kids.

Although this hotel did not have all of the extra free goodies as the Surf and Spa, it was still pretty much a nice hotel and stay. Here are the positives:Location: EXCELLENT location for just about everything in Waikiki. The bus stops right on the corner. You won't even need a car if you are just staying in Waikiki beach. You can walk to everything Waikiki has to offer! Dennys is right across the street. Hotel is right next door to a Starbucks. Hotel is about a block or so from a bit expensive (sans the Pineapples) grocery store. International Marketplace is a few blocks down with every kind of food imaginable, plenty of shopping, free stage entertainment, and great koi ponds. There is an ABC store right across the street. There are also several ABC stores within a minute or so of the hotel. (ABCs are like a dressed up 7-11, but much cleaner. They are great for souvenirs or a last minute snack or a morning muffin.) Up the street is the main drag for Waikiki where there is a mile or so of stores, restaurants, malls, etc...Very fun for window shopping and people watching. At night there is always some sort of entertainment going on along this walk. I would be out until 1 am or so and always felt safe walking from the main drag back to the hotel. The police are VERY good at patrolling Waikiki and keeping everything under control. There are NO alcoholic beverages allowed in your hands while walking around Waikiki. Also, do NOT jaywalk or ride a bike and cross the street anywhere where you are not suppose too. USE the crosswalks. The police WILL give out tickets if they catch you violating these rules..Hotel is a very easy 7-10 minute walk to the beach. Or a 15-20 minute walk to awesome FREE snorkeling just past Waikiki beach close by the aquarium. (Hotel gives you huge fluffy beach towels to use. Just remember to return them or you will get charged $35.) Employees: Harry is hilarious!! My housekeeper and her husband were VERY sweet and very attentive to our needs. I made sure and tipped them extra. Rest of the staff were very kind and attentive to us except for one girl working the night shift; she was upset with me because I turned in a towel at 1 am. (They check their towel list at midnight.) So if you plan to do some night swimming, just let them know ahead of time. I can't blame them for wanting their nice fluffy towels back. ☺Internet: Free and fast! It is wired, yes, but to even be able to FIND free internet at any hotels in Waikiki is amazing. I did not mind having to hook into the wired router. Aqua Aloha Surf and Spa is also free wired internet.Room: Very clean and enough room to store luggage in a long sliding closet. There is a safe in the closet. Clean fresh linens. NO Bedbugs!! Comes with a mini fridge, microwave, and small coffee pot with coffee packs. Fridge is great for getting stuff to make sandwiches with and storing drinks to save some $$. Bathroom has tons of storage underneath the sink. Showerhead is great; water pressure is excellent. Tub and sink drained great. Never lost hot water while taking those long showers after night swimming. Windows are tinted and room curtains are very good at keeping the room dark until you want to let the light in. Here are a few things that sorta just bugged me but did really bother others. Price: I paid a little over a $1000 for 7 days through the web site. My original price was $896 but the website decided to act up so I called their direct line and the gal that helped me told me that even though I had my reservation #, the price was no longer available on the web, and for what I wanted I'd have to pay an extra $100+ total. Ok fine...it happens. So I asked for a high up room and King bed wound up with a second floor room with a queen and double bed, facing the parking lot. I figured this is all they had left and I should be grateful. Well, here is where the noise factor comes in. At night, there will be a lot of sirens, etc... zooming by on the main drag. When the bar next door lets out, you'll hear a few drunk folks hooting and hollering. In the wee hours there is a lot of noise going on due to the trash truck picking up trash, delivery trucks, housekeeping getting ready for their day, etc... Being on the second floor, all of this sound is multiplied. Fortunately I had earplugs, but my colleague did not and was woken up several times during the night and morning. During the day, it is also very noisy. You are in downtown Waikiki so there will be noise, but since you are so close to a main street, it is extra loud. I was not in my room too much during the day, but during the times I was, I could definitely hear it. It didn't bother me but I did hear others that were also on the same floor as us complaining. My advice: Go exploring! But, if you have to be in the room, turn on the A/C. It has a dull white noise that cancels out most of the other noises going on. And if you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs. Dogs: This hotel is one of the hotels the military uses when it needs to house military personnel traveling or moving with dogs. Big dogs, little dogs, it doesn't matter. The dogs that were close to us barked every time someone opened or closed a door. At 12 midnight, it was not pleasant for other hotel guests. Many of times the dogs were left abandoned in the room and we could hear them whining and barking. I kinda felt sorry for them. Again, I used my earplugs at night but others without earplugs were none to thrilled at the yappers. Some applauded when the guests with the dogs checked out! Ants: My room had a slight ant problem. The windows at the top of the wall in the room have these little spaces in the glass slats and the ants somehow found their way through these slats and made a beeline for the bathroom and the top of the area where the microwave is and where I had food. I swear they were acrobatic ants. I could see their trail at the top of the ceiling. Fortunately they were harmless tiny black ants. I sprayed them with Lysol, but they kept returning. I let the front desk know and within 30 minutes they took care of the ants. After that, the ants never returned during my stay, thank goodness! Parking: We decided to rent a car and it was very hard to get parking. Parking is a precious commodity anywhere in Waikiki beach so if you do decide to use a car, be prepared to pay. The hotel charged $20.00 a night, which is VERY reasonable for the area.TIP: If you want to park 6 blocks away, the Banyan Hotel straight down heading south on Kuhio & Ohua street has a huge multi level parking garage with security that charges only $10.00 per 24 hours. You enter the garage from the west side of Kuhio. It's about a 10 minute walk from the parking garage to the Pearl, and a rather nice walk day or night thanks to Hawaiis marvelous weather temperatures. The night time walk gave me a good reason to stop in at the ABC market and get my next mornings yogurt and muffin. Prostitutes: Even in beautiful Waikiki, they are there. They come out at about 11PM and you definitely can tell who they are by how they dress. They seem to like to hang out across the street by Dennys and another hotel within eye distance of the Pearl. The cops do their best to shoo them away but they really are unstoppable because the ""streetwalkers"" know what their rules and rights are. They aren't mean; they won't stalk you or beg from you or hurt you, but if you are out late at night and are male or with a male, they may ask you if you want a ""friend"". Just keep walking along and ignore them and you'll be fine. ☺I would stay here again because of the location, free internet, and great customer service, but I would first check to see if their sister hotel over on the next block, The Aqua Surf and Spa, has rooms. They are both the same price but the Aqua Surf and Spa has a small pool, most rooms have a lanai, there is a cute tropical waterplant in room, and a free small breakfast. Just remember, you're in Hawaii, om Waikiki beach!! You shouldn't be in the room TOO much!! Besides, who needs one of those expensive fancy rooms??? Get out there and have fun and relax!! Jump in that beautiful warm water and see the gorgeous fish! Watch the planes fly by above you as you soak up the sun. Swim at night just so you can say you did. Eat fresh pineapple while watching the hula dancers! Get a Dole Whip! Enjoy the beautiful blue sky, warm weather, and friendly people. It's what it's all about when going to the Islands. ☺",Oregon,"Noodles913</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oregon</strong>",63,4.0

I always have apprehensions before I arrive at a hotel when I make the reservations via the internet. I called the hotel to see if they had transportation from the airport and they said that they didn't but gave me information regarding transportation and I felt very comfortable when we arrived at the airport .

The bus stop is 2 minute walk away and the beach about 7. You ask at the front desk for a beach towel and just drop it in the laundry basket next to the lift on your return (no charge).There is a computer in the foyer and wi-fi in all the rooms for laptops (also free).With a laundry on site (not free) we found the Pearl ideal for our 4 week stay.

We received very short notice. We were unable to find a hotel that had three straight weeks availbable, until we called the Aqua Pearl. So we took four rooms. We rented a car at the airport and drove to the hotel.There were only 20 parking spots in the back of the hotel. The hotel has probably 200 - 300 rooms. We felt lucky there was one available when we got there and we parked our car. We parked there the first two nights we were there. But when we woke up at 5 am on our third day there, we saw that our rental car had been booted. I called the front desk and they said that we had to pay to park there and that I could get the boot off for $50. They also asked ""didn't you SEE all the reserved signs in the parking lot????"". I replied ""well yes I did, I thought they meant reserved for hotel guests"". But their tone with me was far from customer-service oriented. They acted like I was crazy for being upset that they booted my car for being parked in their lot.We were never asked at check-in if we had a car. If we had been asked, they could have informed us about the parking situation at the hotel, instead of BOOTING one of their guest's car. We live in the U.S. mainland, so we're not used to hotels charging us to park at their hotel.I just think it's very sorry customer service to just boot one of your guest's car without any warning, then tell them they have to pay $50 to have it taken off. It makes me feel like this is used as another avenue for profit. Besides that, the hotel isn't that nice. I was disappointed already when I saw what it looked like. Then to have the hotel boot my rental car without warning and tell me I have to give them $50 to get it taken off.!! I heard it was just renovated, so I really wonder what it must have looked like before. It's in a seedy-looking area.The walls are not very soundproof at all. If anyone within five doors of you shuts the door to their room, it's loud enough to make you jump.

I have stayed at several of the Aqua resorts during business trips in the past. By far I put the Aqua Waikiki Pearl at the top of my list. Not only is it affordable for a family or business the service was exceptional. Chris the security guy was the coolest! The staff from front desk to maid service were always with the Aloha spirit.There are many complaints about the noise levels in the surrounding areas. If you have never been to the honolulu area it is literally the concrete jungle as the locals call it. Expect street noise, expect the ""ladies of the night"" to be roaming the streets, yes all the streets not just Kuhio street. Unless you are staying at a hotel facing the beach and are on the 20th plus floor, ANY hotel you stay at will have some noise. My family and I stayed in the 2 bedroom suite, room 502, when my wife and I were in the master bedroom at night we could hear nothing with the door closed to the living area. My 13 yr old daughter slept on the pull out couch and said she only heard the trash truck at 8am... time to get your butt up lazy teenager( lol). Dont expect a view at all and again for those hotels that have a view/partial view/city view, you will pay for it.The location is great. took my family 6 mins to walk to the beach with all the boogie boards and mats (PROVIDED BY THE FRONT DESK). The international marketplace is less than 100 yds from the hotel entrance. Because parking in Honolulu is hard to come by I called ahed to the hotel (about a month early) and reserved my parking for my arrival which they had waiting when we rolled in at 1am.Good job Pearl team!

This trip included my husband, 70, our son, 17, and me -- I'm nearly 50 and a flight attendant who stays in hotels good and bad all over the world. We have stayed at this hotel under at least three different owners since '97. The Aqua chain has made it into a place we think of as our vacation home. My husband, who adores Waikiki, won't go if there isn't room at the Pearl. We have, at times, stayed at other properties, all more expensive. None compares.Prescilla at the front desk welcomed us warmly and checked us in QUICKLY (important after a long flight), but we saw several familiar faces at the desk during our week-long stay and I like to think that the management is creating an environment where employees want to stay. There were new vending areas and ice machines and the renovation (we stayed in the first fully renovated room two years ago) has made this place into a real gem. The lobby (where the Wifi is free) is VERY comfy with plush sofas and open air, and no one seemed to notice my teen-ager camping out there to play a video game. He plugged in his laptop and put on his headphones and no one minded and I didn't worry at all, it seemed very safe. There is a very nice computer set up in the lobby for checking in for your flights and perusing your email, if I'd known it would be there I wouldn't have dragged my laptop to Hawaii. The management has wisely NOT set it up with a chair, and have put it near the front desk, so that folks (especially kids) aren't tempted to abuse it as I have seen happen at hotels all over the world. There is a Starbucks so close you will begin to think it's part of the property. (Tip: Bring a Starbucks card with you for every member of your family, it makes checking out SO much quicker.)We've never rented a car in Waikiki so I can't talk about parking except to say that it appears there is a small lot off the lobby.We use Reliable Shuttle to and from the Pearl, it is not only reliable but very reasonably priced and they know the address well (415 Nahua is at the corner of Nahua and Kuhio.) The front desk will call them for you when you depart and provide their number so you can arrange transportation for your arrival; just call and ask.We had a small problem with our lanai door when we arrived and Pam, who is in charge of maintenance, came within minutes to get it fixed. She lives on the property and I like knowing that there is always someone there to come and see competently to things, which she definitely did.There is a frig/mike/coffeemaker/icebucket in the room, we used them all and they were all perfectly clean (practically new) and in working order. The frig means we can bring back restaurant leftovers (a lot of places serve positively huge portions, particularly Cheesecake Factory and Duke's Canoe Club); we chill and reheat for a quick lunch the next day, saving us time and trouble (and having to listen to a teen-age boy say, ""I'm hungry."") Buy some Kona at the 24-Hour Food Pantry (one block away) and have coffee in your room every morning if you wish with a sliced papaya (packaged in halves at the supermarket and with a fork). Stick a bottle or two of wine or some vodka and juice in your frig.The lanai is nicely sheltered and we were able to sit out and read when it rained once. The A/C is fabulous (operated with a remote) and we had internet in the room (hooked up behind the new TV). One thing we like about the Pearl is the bathroom; it is large, new and there is a full tub with the usual toiletries and a full size hairdryer. We also like the long hall from the door into the room; it's a great place to shake off your sand and stow your beach stuff. The drawer handles in the room and bath are like towel bars, and they're handy!A stack of complementary newspapers is put out every morning on the front desk. We asked for extra towels every day and there were always plenty.Many of the folks I ran into in the lobby seemed to be either repeat guests (like us) or folks from other Hawaiian islands. We saw lots of families with kids younger than our son.This is no lavish spot or honeymoon resort; frankly, I wouldn't go to Waikiki for a honeymoon or some completely blissful getaway. It's not that kind of place, and anyone who's been there knows that. But for what we have come to call a ""familymoon"" -- a comfy, cheap getaway with all that we need and nothing we don't, plenty of sushine and good food and Aloha -- NOWHERE beats this property. Last but NOT least is its LOCATION. As I've already written, Starbucks and a supermarket with fabulous produce and to-go counters of sushi, pastry, bento boxes, etc., are VERY close. The International Marketplace (with food court) is across the street. A liquor/convenience store is directly across from the front door and a dive shop is next to that. Denny's is catercorner. A pharmacy/photo shop/Chili's/bus stop is around the corner from Starbucks and there's a fancy pastry shop on the other side of the Intl. Marketplace entrance. In other words, everything you need for a low-cost, low-stress family getaway is AT HAND. The folks at the desk will tell you which bus to take to get to the movie theater, mall, etc., and how to arrange tours of Pearl Harbor and other sites.I'm reading over the survey questions and frankly, I don't care that there's no pool, restaurant, room service, business or fitness center. Heck, maybe there IS a business and fitness center. What matters to me?In a five minute walk, you are ON THE SAND and staying at a place you will want to return to again and again.","Clemson, SC","ToniVitanza</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clemson, SC</strong>",68,5.0

This time around, we were travelling with other family members and due to a very convenient direct flight from our local airport, we booked an ""air + hotel"" package. I was a little concerned about other reviews of the Aqua Waikiki Pearl, but showed up with an open mind. On first inspection, we were quite appalled by our small, dark and dingy third floor room, with a view that resembled a soviet-era tenement block. Undeterred, we spoke with the very polite and helpful lady at the front desk, and for the price of $10 per day, we upgraded to a larger, brighter room on a higher floor, facing the city. The rest of our party did the same thing. IMHO, the negatives at the Waikiki Pearl still outweigh the positives. On the positive side, the hotel is clean, the beds comfortable, in-room internet is free, the carpets and furnishings new. There's a fridge, microwave and coffee maker. The bathrooms and amenities are fine. Our air conditioner was very good.On the negative side the hotel is located just off Kuhio, which is Waikiki's ""low rent"" strip. The traffic noise (complemented by garbage trucks, loud motorbikes and obnoxious drunks hanging out in front of the sports bar downstairs) can be pretty obnoxious. The patio door in our suite didn't close all the way, which didn't help with the noise issue. The rooms are very sparsely furnished. Oh, and there's no pool. The safe in our room was missing it's locking mechanism. Although our 8th floor room was serviced very nicely every day, our family members on the 6th floor received barely any daily room maintenance at all, including unmade beds and no fresh towels four out of seven days. Overall, the Pearl falls short in several areas. Customer service is uneven at best. Amenities and facilities are barely adequate. But as long as you are prepared to overlook these shortfalls, comfort and security are fine, the beach is no more than a brisk five minute walk away, and hopefully the Aqua people are working to improve the areas that are under their control. I can't say that I would stay here again, but it's probably on par with other 2-star establishments along this section of Kuhio St.","Victoria, BC","GoodPlanet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, BC</strong>",12,2.0

We were travelling with 4 adults (2 parents, and 2 grandparents) and a 20 month old. We booked a 2 bedroom suite, and apparently when the grandparents check in first the room was one of the ones were the second room was separated by a curtain instead of it being 2 actual rooms - and when they mentioned that the staff changed our room for us. We really appreciated the accomodation - the only thing is that there's only 1 washoom and which is located in one of the bedrooms - but if you are an understanding person and flexible it's no problem to allow the people you are staying with to enter in and out of your room at their leisure! (the grandparents stayed in that room and put up with pregnant me going in and out and it was fine).The rooms: nice and spacious! The bathroom is also very very large, and we brought our own sleeping play pen for our little guy and had large pieces of luggage all over our room and it was still great. The living area is also very very spacious which was PERFECT for our little guy - since the grandparents had spoiled him with tons of toys so he had a lot of space to play with them. The kitchen was also very nice and we used it fairly often as we didn't always eat out. The only thing I can suggest to management is to supply cutting boards. Service: like I said before, they accommodated our needs when we requested it. Also, we actually got sick in Hawaii (stupid Luau....) and our little guy was vomitting. We had used a lot of towels, and housekeeping was very understanding and sent up extra towels for us, and changed our sheets and everything by request. Location: this is a pretty subjective thing... but for our needs it was central. right across the international marketplace, 1 block away from all the hustle and bustle, and maybe 4 blocks away from the good part of the beach (where it's barricaded). maybe 3-4 blocks away in the other direction to the higher end of town, where there are a lot of good restaurants. It just depends on what your needs are, but I am 7 months pregnant, and walking is not my cup of tea, so it was great to have the pharmacy and food pantry right at the doorsteps. I've read some of the other reviews, and my impression is that some people just have a higher expectation than what they're looking for. We're from Vancouver and live a comfortable life, and were very happy with our experience at the Pearl. We feel like we got great value (about $1000 for 4 adults for 6 nights). We were not looking for a high end hotel with an awesome view (views are only useful if you plan to stay inside a hotel... but why stay inside if you're in Hawaii??) and amenities. I wanted something reliable, comfortable for family life, and spacious, and if I could find that for good value I was very happy - and we got that at the Pearl! After a couple of nights we really started to feel like it was 'home', and even with 4 of the 5 of us getting a stomach flu we STILL enjoyed our time there, and were very glad that we had a place to call 'home' and rest up in. Will most definitely tell our friends and will stay there again!","Vancouver, Canada","mrs_lo3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",13,4.0

We were not happy. We had been booked into a 'savy saver' room which was a small square box that overlooked a square parking lot. This hotel is quite high and it faced one hotel directly in front of it and two on each side and one square parking lot in the middle. There are no balconies on this side of the hotel. For only $10 more, we were able to 'upgrade' into a nicer, larger room with a balcony, only to find that this side of the street was almost worse. In had garbage trucks in front of it every morning at 7am sharp that were there for at least an hour every day and were very loud. It sat directly outside our hotel EVERY day and emptied all the neighboring garbage bins for all the other hotels and apartments. When that wasn't there, there was usually a delivery truck stocking up the beer/wine/convenience store across the street. It had MANY trucks every day as they all brought different items to the store! I would never stay in this hotel again or recommend it to anyone else. The inside of the hotel was very clean though. There was also a pile of garbage (old computers, shelves, appliances) on the sidewalk that sat outside across the street for us to look at every day. They had a sports pub at the bottom of the hotel that was busy. Twice between 3 - 4am, there were people outside yelling and screaming and the cops were called to clear them up (not by us) on two different nights. The traveller in our room before us also left the hotel and switched to the Aqua Wave which looked so much nicer. I can't belive Westjet would use this hotel for one of their packages. There was also no fitness centre, room service, or pool. The lobby is teeny tiny and is super deceiving in the pictures.

I booked because the price, location, revews are good. I'll have to say though, the pictures online are decieving. We though we were getting a nicely renovated place but it felt like a cheap motel to us. we rented a 2 br suite-- The 2nd br is not enclosed-it's open to the living room. You have to pull a screen to give you some privacy. There's only one bathroom also. So ok, it's my fault for not looking closely before I book.We checked in at night and were givin a room on the 3rd floor. Ok. The first things we do when we check in a hotel is to check for possible signs of bed bugs. The 2 beds were ok but when we pull out the sofa bed, we saw blood stains on the sheets and found 2 LIVE bugs! So that's grossing us out already... walked to the kitchen area and right away saw a small cockroach crawled across the countertop. This all happned 15 min within walking in. So I called front desk and told them about it. She says she'll talk to the manager and call us back. Waited about 30 min and the front desk (not manager) said they can offer us a 1 br?! For 6 people? Needless to say we checked out after that and srambled to find another hotel-with a sleeping baby and luggage!I thought the manager at least should have called us directly and apologize. Even if he's not on duty someone should call and resolve this. I'm not saying NOT to stay at this hotel. I think it's in a good location, across from International marketplace and close to beach.

The hotel is centrally located in Waikiki, about halfway between Kuhio Avenue and Ala Wai Blvd. Like most Waikiki hotels that are not directly on the beach, it doesn't have much of a view of anything except surrounding buildings, but if you go out on the balcony and crank your neck you can see the ocean in one direction and the canal and mountains in the other direction. The hotel itself (again, like most Waikiki hotels), is older, but it has been recently renovated. The lobby is quite pleasant, with big couches on which to sit while waiting for a taxi etc., free wi-fi and a computer for internet access. The elevators are newer but very small (ie it was a challenge to fit the 5 of us and our luggage in one elevator). The hallways are outdoors, which can seem strange if you're not used to that. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite since we were 5 adults travelling together. We had asked to be upgraded to a higher floor for $9 per night to avoid some of the Waikiki noise, and we were glad for the upgrade since the streets are indeed quite noisy in the evening, especially on weekends. (We were on the 9th floor for both stays). Our suites (902 before the cruise and 914 after) were both very clean and quite large. Both were very clean and had comfortable beds. 902 had one closed bedroom with a queen bed, plus another bedroom with a queen bed that was separated from the main living area by a thick curtain. The living area had a double sofa bed plus a table and 4 chairs, and a television. There was also a fully equipped kitchenette with a fridge, a microwave and a stovetop as well as dishes, pots and pans, etc. The bathroom was large but had only a shower (no tub). Also it had no fan, which we found a little strange. There was a big balcony with chairs that provided a convenient spot to dry wet swimsuits, towels etc. 914, the suite we had after the cruise, was even larger than 902. It had 2 closed bedrooms with queen beds plus the same type of living area with a double sofa bed, a table and 4 chairs, a fully equipped kitchenette and a large balcony. The bathroom was huge and had both a tub and a shower. The one downside we found to 914 is that the bathroom is located off the master bedroom, so if anyone needs to use the bathroom during the night they need to walk through the master bedroom to do so. (We were only in that suite for 1 night, so we didn't really mind).The Aqua Waikiki Pearl doesn't have a pool or a fitness centre, but with Waikiki beach a short walk away that wasn't a problem for us. There is a sports bar in the hotel but not really a restaurant (and hence no room service), however there is a little Italian place called Mangiamo across the street that serves a good and inexpensive breakfast, plus a Starbucks right on the corner and a Subway less than 5 minutes away on foot. The hotel offers parking for $20 a night on a first come, first served basis, but we didn't use it since it was full when we arrived. They suggest parking at one of their sister hotels (there are a few in the area, at a municipal lot or on the street which is free on Saturday nights and Sundays).On a final note, I have to say that the staff at the Aqua Waikiki Pearl is friendly and amazing (especially Prescilla at the front desk). All questions were answered promptly, with a smile. All requests were taken care of on the spot. The Aqua Waikiki Pearl may not be luxurious, but it's a great value for money in Waikiki and it offers island hospitality at it's best.","Ottawa, Canada","Sudriveraine</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",88,4.0

Unfortunately that is not what I got. Upon my arrival, the ladies at front desk were busy looking at something and too busy to even greet me even though I was literally standing ten inches away from them. Two minutes is a long time to just stand there without anyone acknowledging your presence. After a brief & speedy check in, I was given my keys & up to the room I went. The room is small, it is about what I expected. The room was very warm and realized later that the AC didn't work very well even though I cranked it up & waited an hour. Upon closer inspection I realized that there was so much dust gunked up in the vents that the cold air probably wasn't getting through. Gross. The microwave is a nice touch, but it was covered with crumbs. The maid obviously wiped the outside down, but didn't bother looking inside. I don't know how often they clean the carpets, but my feet were literally black after walking around the room for one hour barefoot. I bought slippers right away.The bathroom seemed clean, but they only give you 2 towels which had seen better days. One of my friends wanted to make some drinks in the room and we called the front desk to see if they had a can opener ( we had to open coconut milk), the lady told us that they didn't have any. We didn't think it was such a weird request, but she seemed to think so. The windows that are suppose to be one way feel creepy and they do not work if your lights are on in the room, so everyone who walks by and all the people in the hotel across from you can see you. We did not experience any of the warm greeting and aloha spirit other reviewers mentioned. Maybe we went when all of the ""bad"" employees were on duty.I expected it to be clean, not luxurious and people to say hi to you at least, but this was as if I was staying at a motel 6, but Motel 6 has better cable. The area is very good, it is close to a lot of the eateries and shopping, but I think for what I paid I shouldn't have to feel disgusted in the room. Even after the maids supposedly cleaned the rooms, the crumbs in the microwave never left.We were only there for 4 days so we didn't want to repack and move hotels, we weren't in the rooms too much. I have traveled extensively and always on a budget and I expected more based on the reviews.","New York City, New York","Wandering_Lust00</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",9,1.0

The girl at the front desk was on the phone with about 5 people, including me, waiting to check in. When I finally got to the front, she gave me keys to 2 rooms. I told her I only booked 1 room. She said that they did not have the 3 bedroom available so they were giving me 2 rooms instead. I ended up having 2 rooms anyway! I have 4 children, what am I suppose to do? Leave them by themselves in a separate room? Needless to say I was very upset when the front desk girl handed me keys for 2 rooms. I booked this room back in April and called to confirm my reservations TWICE before checking in. Both times I called nothing was said to me about having to split into 2 rooms. Being that they gave me keys to 2 rooms I just assumed that these rooms would be right next to each other. I was wrong...I went back to the front desk and was told that the closest they could get us was on the same floor! Not even adjoining rooms! To top it off neither of the 2 rooms that they gave me had a kitchen! Both rooms had a small refridgerator and a microwave. I understand things happen and I dont usually complain but when I went back down to the front desk the person that was checking in also had their room split! I asked the clerk how many 3 bedrooms they had and she said they had only 1! I asked if it was a regular thing that they split peoples rooms up. ""sometimes"" was the answer I got. Maybe its just me but I dont think that this is good business. I booked this room specifically because it had kitchen and could accommodate me and my family. I didnt appreciate being notified on the day that I check in, that I wasnt getting the room I paid for. I know it wasnt the clerks fault so I wanted to speak to management, who was not there, so I had to wait until the next day. They gave me 2 free nights but still, it was A VERY DISAPPOINTING stay and in fact we checked out early and just went home. You know, its not everyday I'm able to take my family on little getaways...so when I do, its very important to me. Never again will I stay at an Aqua hotel, They really ruined it for my family and I.

When we arrived, we were disappointed that the hotel seemed old and a little run down, and it was surrounded by other buildings rather than any kind of pretty island view. But the lobby and our rooms did look exactly like the pictures on the website - lovely remodel with comfy beds, nice linens, beautiful bathrooms, in-room fridge & coffee-maker.We had chosen rooms with a lanai, thinking it would be relaxing to sit outside. Unfortunately, there are bars just across the street, and the noise kept us awake all night. The next morning we requested quieter rooms, and the front desk staff was happy to move us. The new rooms (without lanai) were quieter, smaller, and cheaper.All during our stay, we dealt with the frustration of door keys that didn't work properly, really slow elevators, noisy air conditioners (although it WAS cool!), and having to park far away from the hotel. But the staff was ALWAYS super friendly, happy to accomodate every request, and kept us on the reserved parking waiting list until we finally landed a parking spot in their tiny lot behind the hotel. Still have to pay for the parking, but much more convenient than parking a few blocks away!Location is close to several places to eat, shop, etc. and not too far from the beach.

Our room #805 was equipped with a microwave, fridge, coffee maker and in room safe. Good coffee was provided also. The bathroom had a shower and tub and was very roomy too. Waikiki is alive at night and so noise from the street can be heard but running the air or tv drowns the noise level. Our housekeeper, Lewelyn was fabulous, especially loved the personal hand written note that she left on our last day. Priscilla at the front desk was very helpful as well. One morning I needed directions to a place and was on google maps writing the directions down, she asked where I was going and printed out the map for me. Additional items that the hotel provided were boogie boards, beach mats and towels. This hotel is centrally located to everything. Getting groceries at the Food Pantry helped out a lot we did not have to eat out every night. Starbucks and Chillis is right next door. Highly recommend paying $20/night for parking at the hotel as parking is painful. Although meter parking after 6 pm and on weekends is free those are hard to come by. If you aren't renting a car you can easily catch the bus as the stop is just around the corner. The beach is only two blocks away, very convenient.

Upon arrival we were able to upgrade our rooms, made a big difference I think. The hotel is old, been revamped, and I could tell they are trying to keep it up with the times as best they can.The room was good, better than many I've stayed in from many years of traveling. The front desk staff were good, very friendly and accommodating. The hotel had spa specials with the spa two doors down or another Aqua hotel nearby. My sis and mom had a massage, and my other sisters did a facial. I actually tried to get in for a bikini waxing last minute, didn't work out, but the hotel desk called around and got me a last minute appt at the marriott. Can't ask for more when in need of services, can you?For what I paid, it was worth it. There was a place to eat breakfast across the street each morning, and a Starbucks on the corner. I also stopped at the St. Germain bakery at the end of my run and bought bread and pastries for the family.The two block walk to the beach was convenient to shopping, eating, lounging on the beach. I was also close enough by car to the Hale Koa for my subsidized PX shopping for gifts.The ABC stores are also a godsend, you can throw a rock in any direction to one.and for those of you worried about such things, the front desk had a hand scale to weigh your bags prior to departure for the airport.The street is not quiet at night, we were there during the world cup and there is an Irish pub right outside the lobby door and a CW bar that is always busy and full of people in the hotel around the corner. My last night there I did hear a terrible fight that went on forever, somebody got their butt wihipped for a good while until the police showed up, then it was quiet again until morning.I felt relatively safe, I went out and walked or ran by the canal each day.I miss Hawaii already","Washington DC, District of Columbia","materielgrrl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",13,3.0

They told us to park next door in another hotel's underground parking, so naturally i assumed i was paying something extra, and eagerly checked in on parking in their lot, which was in the back of the hotel in a dodgey lot, and assumedly free. They had us on a wait list, and we didn't hear from them concerning it for three days. Then when i asked they checked again on a clip board and said they did have parking, and they had tried to call us (nope) but didn't have our name written down correctly, quickly referenced an empty slot on a paper, then wrote our last name. Our car was then in the parking lot, in a dark spot under a tree, where it could be spotted with bird poo. Whatever. But the desk attendant was rude after i called him on over charging me a night.The room was fine, there was no coffee or coffee maker, and it was so noisy in the early morning that we just dealt with getting up at 6am. It must take the city 3 hours to pick up all the hotel's garbage each day, which is surprising because there isn't any way to seperate your recycleables, so you'd think it'd be one big pile. The amount of paper and plastic we had no choice but to throw out was disgusting.The elevators are remarkably slow and the buttons rarely light up. The staff were just sort of there...sometimes. Cleaning people were friendly, though we kept the 'do not disturb' sign on our door for our whole stay, so i can't speak to their cleaning talents. The location was great(ish). The view from our 7th floor balcony was kind of depressing. Into other hotels and into what appeared to be half empty slums, and the repulsive canal down the street.

The room we originally had was too small for us and it had no view. We wanted a room with the city view since we were going to be there for a week and we were willing to sacrifice spending money to be totally comfortable. I called the hotel about two weeks before our departure date and spoke with the manager, Kalei Lyman and asked if we could upgrade our room. He checked the computer for availability and said yes. However, because it was our 24th wedding anniversary, he waived the upgrade fee. We were so touched by Mr. Lyman generosity because even though all we had to have for our vacation was spending money, we struggled with even that because we are putting a daughter through college. Mr. Lyman didn't know that. Not having to pay the additional fee made - what we consider - a signicant difference in the amount of spending money we had. Mr. Lyman was a true blessing to us and we want to pause today to say, ""Thank you"" for having him as a manager. He represented the company well. We would definitely stay at the Aqua Waikiki Pearl again when we visit Hawaii; even if we have to pay full price.There's no way we could repay him for his generosity at a time when it counted most.

The place is clean, the rooms are cozy, the location is more than adequate and the service is exceptional. I stayed in a standard room with lanai on the 9th floor facing towards Nahua Street. My room, the elevators and the hotel common areas were always clean throughout the duration of my 11 night stay. From the lanai was a great view of the city to the west, a peak at the ocean to the south and a nice view of a waterway & golf course to the north. The extra charge for an upper floor lanai is worth it! The beach is only a few blocks walk to the south and there are numerous nice local and/or chain restaurants, and a convenience store, just outside.The only drawback of the hotel is the sound of garbage trucks each morning between 6 - 6am. My room was more than peaceful and quiet for 23 hours out of each day, but for some reason the sound of the big trucks in the morning seemed unavoidable...even on the 9th floor. I didn't have too much problem with that because I wanted to be awake early anyway. However, I would probably try to obtain a fan to drown out the noise the next time.Overall, the charm of the hotel was the friendliness, courteousness and respectful of the staff.

The last vacation we took we were crammed into a 10x12 foot room and we were miserable, so this hotel offered a 2 bedroom with full kitchen and almost 1000 square feet. So, space we did get, but not much else. We really only had 1 bedroom and the other bedroom was a bed behind a curtain. We had 1 T.V. The full kitchen was a joke. We had a mini coffee maker, 2 burners, a small fridge and a microwave. Dishes-only a few-flatware-only a few. Pans-just the bare minimum of everything. Good thing we did not really cook. It would have been grossly inadequate for that. Oh-it did come with roaches-babies-lots of them. When we checked in we had a a full garbage can in the kitchen of someone elses garbage and 1 bath towel for 4 people. We had to ask for everything. Nothing was provided without effort on our part. We were told we had complimentary coffee provided every day and as much as we wanted. Well, it depends on who you ask. The maid does not provide it so we would have to ask down at the desk and by day 3 we were told that we get 1 packet for free and that is it. Now, we were 4 people with a mini coffee maker, so we needed 2 packets of coffee to give each person in our party a cup of coffee in the morning. We all had to share one bathroom, but we managed with that. Upon our arrival, we could not get into the buiding because they lock the entry door at 10pm. We read about that ahead of time online and called them to inquire about this and they assured us that the door will be open for us even at the late hour of our arrival. Well, it wasn't, so we had to follow someone in who had a key. We asked for a room on a high floor since we had read online that the garbage trucks wake people up because thay are so noisy. The check in went smoothly. As for the maid service-well sometimes we had it and sometimes we didn't. They work on ""island time."" In other words, whenever they get there and when they get there they only make the beds. We asked at the desk and left a note and a tip for the maid to clean our floors and vacuum as they were not clean upon our arrival. Well, the tip was gone but the same trash, leftovers, dirt and toe nail clippings were still on the floor. We were instructed to place our used towels on the floor so the maid would know which ones were used, but when we left to go out for the day and we returned, the maid had not come yet and now all our towels were on the dirty floor and not able to be used, so again we would go down to the desk to get new ones. They are definitely used to this because they seem to keep extra of everything at the desk and will accommodate you for any request. But to have to ask for everything is a lot of expended effort while on vacation. Oh-as for the garbage trucks, oh yes, they woke us up every morning except Christmas and Sunday between 6am and 7am, even though we on the 9th floor, we could hear them perfectly. We eventually began sleeping with ear plugs!! The building is old and according to my inspector husband-displays a lot of construction errors! So, what good can I say-Well, the room had about 1000 square feet give or take and the hotel was near a lot of things. The beach was a 2 block walk, but we knew that before we came. No one knew the hotel by name because it has changed name so many times-including our cab driver from the airport-so I gave him the address. They were nice enough to print our boarding passes for us at the desk although not without sarcasm and negative inferences regarding mine and my daughters intelligence. The hotel had a bar but nothing else. We had no car so we did not have the parking issue. We managed well with ""the bus,"" as it was cheap and easy to use. I bought a package hotel and airfare combo but I would not do that again as I shudder to think of how much I really paid for this hotel. I would definitely stay at a well known hotel next time and have more ammenities available like pool, restaurants, hot tub, service, etc. This was definitely a ""no frills"" hotel, but not at a ""no frills"" price!","Palm Harbor, Florida","darcymrn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palm Harbor, Florida</strong>",0,2.0

I would recommend paying the extra $$ for the balcony/city view because it's so worth it,I loved having the sliding door open while I was in the room because theres always a nice breeze. Nightlife is great in Waikiki especially if you're young. It did get a little noisy at night & early morning but it's not as bad as other people said. I didn't have any pest/bug problems either. Mike that worked the front desk was super nice as well as the other guy that worked there & one of the girls(the one with the colored eyes) she was so sweet. I liked the location because the International market place was like a 5 min walk( local food in the food court there,I recommend eating local food while visiting because you'll save money & get the try new things!) Also here was food pantry to pick up groceries & other things like 5 mins away. Big Kahuna's is within walking distance & is nice to eat & grab drinks. The beach is like 10 mins walking & super easy to get to. Waikiki is pretty nice but expensive to non-locals so I recommend getting out of Waikiki during the day & exploring what the rest of the island of Oahu has to offer(beaches,hanauma bay,Kualoa Ranch,pearl harbor to name a few things) The hotel has brochure's in the lobby so check them all out, trust me as a local it was worth getting to play tourist for a week with my brother! If you can avoid going to the bar that's next to the hotel do it! it isn't worth it & doesn't show any Hawaii hospitality whatsoever.

We were looking for a hotel that was a decent value. We were not looking for 5 star quality or service, just a clean room that we could use. If you are expecting anything other than a 2 star, you need to pay more and look elsewhere. If you are looking for a clean hotel at one of the cheapest prices in Honolulu, you might want to consider it. The good: The hotel is exactly what I expected and actually a little more. The room was a double queen on the 6th floor. The bedding was pretty comfortable, carpet new, bathrooms ""remodeled."" Once again, nothing fancy, but clean and adequate. The pleasant surprise was the size of the rooms. They had plenty of room for the family. A coffee pot (no coffee provided) and a mini fridge might come in handy for drinks or snacks. The hotel is located on the north entrance of the International market. A quick walk through the market (about 1 block) puts you in the heart of one of the upper ends of Honolulu and another 2 blocks over on the primary point of Wikiki Beach (near ""Duke's"" statue and surf board rentals). This location was prime for this area during the day.The bad. What a difference a few blocks make. The first night we were woken up about 5:00am by a drunk man banging on a down spout, yelling and singing. The second night we were woken up at 3:30am by the yelling of a crowd and someone saying ""drop your weapon."" Don't worry, sirens soon followed and by 3:45 I'm guessing things were better. My wife and I listened to a rain forest app to drown out the noise and luckily the kids slept through it all. Also, while we were out on the balcony trying to see what was going on we saw what appeared to be a drug exchange in front of the hotel. In all fairness, these negatives had little to do with the hotel itself (with the exception of the sliding door blocking out very little noise, including the 5:30 garbage truck that others mentioned). There are a couple of much pricier hotels that would have had to put up with the same distractions. Next time we will either stay at one of the hotels on the beach (just a couple blocks away) or a little further away all together. In summary, a economical, clean, remodeled, bare bones hotel. It is a good value, but have realistic expectations going in.",OKC,"M C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>OKC</strong>",91,3.0

For a budget hotel... Aqua Pearl had it all! I booked thru orbitz with a package including the hotel. It is across the street from the international market, steps from starbucks, 2 blocks from the beach and really nicely located. I upgraded a room on orbitz, one queen and one full sized bed. Nice bathroom and balcony facing the street. Not much to look at but other hotels... however at night, the building lights gave a nice glow. The balcony didn't face a huge hotel right in front so that's also a pro. 300-350 sq ft. Had a mini frig, microwave, free safe and FREE in room internet (ethernet)! Other hotels would charge like 10 bucks a day! Downside... I booked the hotel for 5 nights and left after the 1st night. As the title says.. there were cockroaches. The first night... I noticed lil ants on the desk as I was researching Waikiki for tours. I killed at least 5. The next morning everything was fine up until 11am I found a cockroach about 1 1/2 inch long in the bathroom. As I went to phone front desk about the encounter, I noticed a cockroach on my laptop (which was placed on the desk where I had killed 5 ants the night before). As I investigated... I noticed 1 more ant on the desk... however this time it had a clear white bottom half. Baby cockroaches! Front desk sent maintenance, he was there promptly. He checked it out, left and came back with a spray can and thoroughly sprayed the infected areas. I was given the opp. to take a room on the 2nd floor (the only other room opened), however because of the size and 8th floor location I decided that if the spray didn't work I would move. Based on other reviews... Im a heavy sleeper but the noise at night and the dump truck in the morning were a bit much. So, I remained in the room to make sure the lil bugs didn't come back and I waited for the housekeeping to stop by and vacuum the room. 2 hours later as I was working on my laptop on the bed... something caught my attention out of the corner of my eye.... ANOTHER 1 1/2 inch cockroach on the headboard of the bed! I really liked the location and the hotel but that was it! I have never felt more disgusted in my life! The maintenance guy said it could be that cockroaches laid eggs in the new furniture before they received it, so I thought it was only the desk. Boy was I wrong!I threw everything (literally) into my luggage and bolted out of there. I called the lobby as I was packing and front desk said they were booked out. I waited in the lobby 30 min before the said they could move me to the 2nd floor. Forget it. I was over Aqua Pearl! I rather stay in a older hotel without pest problems than stay there and chance it. I was in the lobby of Aqua Pearl around 1:30. The hotel had me call my agent and go thru the whole loop of refunds and this and that. In the end the hotel wanted to charge me for 2 nights cuz chk out was at 12. I had to demand that they refund me that night as well before I got results. Would I stay a the Aqua Pearl again? Probably not. There are many other great hotels. BTW I booked a room at the Royal Garden. away from the noise but still walking distance of all things. The room is on the 12th floor with balcony.. great view of the canal and mountains! I have a frig 2x the mini frig at Aqua Pearl, microwave, stove with oven, conditioner, great view and NO roaches!

The Aqua Group have brought a lot of the older Hotels in Waikiki and renovated them, this is one of their better efforts. Formally the Honolulu Prince Hotel the newly renovated Pearl has been renovated correctly. Please note, this hotel does NOT have a Pool. The renovations are simple and it has a very modern, clean feel which extends into each of the rooms. I opted for the end room (higher numbers, I think my room was 917, 9th floor at the quiet end of the building) and it was quiet. I really liked the matting style carpet and unlike many renovations, the Pearl had new bathrooms. My room was spacious and clean, there was a big closest, the safe didn't work but there was enough hanging and storage space for two people. The bed was big and comfortable, there is a flat screen TV with cable and free wifi.I got what I thought was a good deal from a Trip Advisor partner, $65 a night plus tax (17%). This is a very good deal for this Hotel. I don't think it is worth more than $85 a night even in the high season (November 2009). The location is great, while being near the noisy clubs, it is far enough away so you don't get bothered by it. The staff were way better at this Aqua Hotel, especially Harry. Harry worked the front desk and would always go out of his way to make sure he could accommodate my requests, airport transfers, quarters for the laundry, directions to places etc. There are plenty of good value restaurants nearby and there is a 24 hour store minutes away.This is a budget Hotel but it is very well setup and managed, and if you can get it for a good price i.e. under $80 a night then you'll get really good value.",Shanghai,"kristian_page</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shanghai</strong>",42,4.0

Only 2 lifts, of which 1 was out of service for 1 of the 2 weeks we stayed here. Room was absolutly huge with balcony and airconditioned.

Room was cleaned every day. Bedding and towels clean. We could not connect to the internet, friendly staff quickly came and sorted it out for us. Have to pay extra for use of safe. Fridge, microwave, filter coffee pot and two mugs provided, but no teaspoons, sugar or coffee (would have at least expected teaspoons so you could buy the rest from the shop. Not quite what I expected from a hotel). No plants / flowers in the room as shown on their website BTW. Location good - just two blocks away from Waikiki beach.

For the first week, I was there with two friends in their double queen room, and was in a one bedroom suite for Labor Day Weekend. The first room was a very generous size, almost 500 sq ft, had a mini-fridge and decent size bathroom. The suite was bigger, not sure exactly how big, but was basically a one bedroom condo with a kitchen! As their website will tell you, they just recenlty completed renovating their rooms from top to bottom and it shows. I was a little worried at first, because of the older reviews of The Pearl from before their renovation weren't as glowing, but I have a strong feeling that will change now for sure. The best part of my stay there easily would be the Aqua Pearl's staff and the wonderful customer service they provide. Despite the modest size of the Pearl, there was ALWAYS somebody at the lobby desk, no matter the time of night, and they were always friendly and welcoming. After 10 days there, I knew most of them by name, Mike, Kalei, Harry, Wayne, Robin, and the really cool two lobby folks who seemed to man the desk into the wee hours of the morning when I came in from a long night out. They were always so helpful, that Robin even gave me her own bottle of conditioner she had on her when I needed some. That's customer service, something you're definitley hard-pressed to find these days anywhere, let alone a very nice, yet modest place like the Aqua Waikiki Pearl. I would definitley recommend it to anybody looking for a no frills, yet still hidden gem of a place smack dab in the middle of everywhere at a VERY reasonable price. Just to be fair, I should mention that if quiet is a high priority for your stay, you might take issue because of the median age of the other hotel guests being younger, and if you face the street, you will get some traffic noise, but nothing my hearos didn't take care of easily.

The hotel is not located right on the beach but the walking did us good because there is great food everywhere and we ate ... a lot. Also, the hotel left us a coupon for a free Mai-Tai at the hotel bar ... small and kind of dive-y (which we love) with lots of regulars (very interesting crowd). The Mai Tais were awesome (and cheap) and happy hour lasted until 8pm.
