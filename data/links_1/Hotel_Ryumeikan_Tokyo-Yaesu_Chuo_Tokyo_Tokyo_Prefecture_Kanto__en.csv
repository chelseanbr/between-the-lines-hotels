This time we had a standard double room no view. For 3 nights it was fine. Not masses of space but enough for 2 of us. Small tatami area at the end of the bed where you can sit at a small table. The room had everything you could possibly need (except a bottle opener which we were able to borrow). There is everything else though. Slippers, shoe trees for your shoes, yakatas and Japanese nightshirts as well as all manner of toiletries. The shower was great - didn’t want to ever come out. We didn’t eat at the hotel but there is an Excelsior cafe almost next door where you can have breakfast and many nearby restaurants for dinner as well as many restaurants in the station. As others have said the hotel is very close to the station ( but not noisy) so you can easily get from the airport on the Narita express and you can easily get around Tokyo on the local trains ( if you have a JR pass) or on the metro. You just have to find the Yaesu north entrance. This is challenging when you first arrive but Yaesu south or central are also ok. You just have to walk along the side of the station to the north end. We found the hotel good value for money. The staff were friendly and helpful. Though we didn’t see much of them as the rooms are on floors below reception. I would highly recommend this hotel for tourists or business travellers. ","Birmingham, United Kingdom","CatherineE905</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, United Kingdom</strong>",41,5.0

There is also a subway line right around the corner (which we didn't end up using for the short time we stayed). The hotel is beautifully decorated with a small gift shop and a restaurant on the 15th floor where reception is. We selected the Forus Double Room hoping it would provide a little extra space (Tokyo hotel rooms are known to be rather small). Our room was a perfect size for the two of us. It had a double bed with a sitting mat attached to the end of it. The hotel provided water, snacks, and even a cell phone to take out with you in our room (we did not use the phone so I don't know how well it worked, but thought this was a nice option). The bathroom had a phenomenal shower (ALL THE JETS) and I truly enjoyed that the toilet seats were automatic! All of the staff we encountered was extremely pleasant.

Here's a rundown of the stuff that like or not like about the hotel:LIKES:1. Transportation scene. The hotel is just across the Tokyo Station hub and a walk away from the Ginza line so it's very easy to go anywhere by train or Metro. You can also take the airport bus to and from the airport because the terminal is just across the street.2. Food scene. There's a Family Mart convenience store next to the hotel so your basic necessities are covered. A few blocks away and you have restaurants and cafes, some are even open 24 hours. You can also explore the wondrous restaurants in the Tokyo Station plus the food stalls at the basement floor of Daimaru.3. Sleeping. Although the bed is really small (Part of my dislikes), for some reason I slept well in this hotel. It was also relatively quiet. I thought we can hear the noise coming from the street, but we didn't get that at all.4. Toiletries. They have luxurious toiletries! Although I'm not familiar with the brand, their shampoo, conditioner, and body soap smell really good!NOT LIKE:1. Small room. We booked the Standard Semi-Double from Agoda so this is expected. There are bigger rooms in this hotel, but we're not prepared to shell out for some extra space.2. Small bed. It's not a double but a SEMI-DOUBLE, so it's expected as well. This is acceptable for couples, but I can't imagine having the same sharing set-up with a business colleague.That's about it! I'd probably consider staying here again the next time we visit Tokyo.","Quezon City, Philippines","jovanpuyo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Quezon City, Philippines</strong>",132,4.0

The room is small but the amenities probably exceed that of most mid-range hotels: comfortable bed, fantastic shower, extensive bathroom amenities, a 'Handy' smartphone, and free bottled water. The windows are sound-proof and also include blackout curtains which was also a very welcomed bonus.As highlighted in a previous review, the layout of the hotel is fairly unique. The lobby is on the 15th floor, but all the rooms are on floor 14 and below. Therefore, you will never interact with or even see any of the hotel staff unless you are checking in or out. This is the first time I've experienced something like this while on holiday. Nonetheless, on the very few times I did interact with staff, everyone was very nice and helpful. Cleaning seems to occur after 10am and was always completed to a high standard.In regards to location, it's definitely super convenient for getting around as both the JR Tokyo and Nihombashi stations are only a minute or two walk away. However, this area is considerably 'quieter' by Tokyo standards and lacks the bright lights + chaos of Shinjuku and Shibuya (either a positive or negative, depending on what you're after).Highly recommended, especially for the price.","Canberra, Australia","xgrowupx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",16,5.0

Each time, I found the basic customer service to be lacking but, because of the hotel's location, I put up with it. This last stay was the last straw. First of all, the people at the front desk are unfriendly, to the point of rudeness (highly unusual in Japan). This time when I checked in, after a long flight from New York, I dealt with Miss [-] and Miss [-], both unsmiling. But I noticed later that Miss [-] was actually very friendly to Japanese guests and to a white man (I am American of Asian descent), so perhaps it's just good old-fashioned racism at work? Who knows. I had booked a room that said on the booking site that it had a window but actually faces a wall. I asked for another room and was shown a smaller rand cheaper room with a window. I chose that one for the window, but because it was around 2000 yen cheaper per night--I had prepaid for two nights so that was a 4000 yen difference (and I had also prepaid for another two nights at the end of my Japan trip)--I asked if they could throw in the breakfast and I would pay the 500 yen/breakfast remaining difference (around $4.50). The breakfast buffet was 2500 yen--but costs the hotel much less, of course--and I had already prepaid most of that cost per night. Miss [-] refused. Still unsmiling. I reminded her that I would be staying at their hotel again for two more nights at the end of my Japan trip and that I was a repeat customer. She remained inflexible and unsmiling. I requested to speak to the manager but because he was not yet coming in for another hour, I asked that he call me in my room.Of course, the manager did not call me so I had to call and ask for him. He, Mr. [-], came to my room with Miss [-] at his side. I explained the situation (I also wanted to tell him about the customer service at the front desk but couldn't because Miss [-] was right there). Mr. [-] was not particularly friendly but he reluctantly agreed to give me ONE night's breakfast as a comp. Then he proceeded to tell me that this was a ""gift"" and that I could not ask for another breakfast later. He repeated this point more than once and made me feel like I was a criminal and was trying to rip them off, even though what I had prepaid covered the costs of two breakfasts. The whole encounter left a bad taste in my mouth. Not the way to treat a repeat customer or any customer--especially since the cost to them was almost nothing.  Nonetheless, I tried to ignore what had happened and enjoy exploring Tokyo for the remaining day and a half I was there. On the last day before I was to check out, I asked the front desk person--a Miss [-], also unsmiling--if she could make me a lunch reservation at a sushi place the next day since I don't speak Japanese. This seemed like a basic concierge request that could not go wrong, right? Wrong. Miss [-] said, ""No"" she could not make me a lunch reservation since check-out was at 11 a.m. and that the lunch would be at noon. I was incredulous. She insisted this was hotel policy. I told her that the restaurant did not charge a no-show fee or anything. She asked her male colleague. Both insisted they could not help me. No genuine apology, no attempt to help, no smile. Nothing. The reason for going to a hotel over an Airbnb is because of the convenience of concierge service. But this stay at Hotel Ryumeikan left a terrible feeling. I absolutely dreaded going to the front desk each time I needed something. I knew I would be greeted by unfriendly faces and a ""No"" to whatever I asked. My hunch is that the management at the hotel is doing something wrong to produce such terrible customer service (the front desk people look miserable most of the time).Let me end by saying that there were two exceptions to the terrible customer service I received during my stay: one a young man with spiky hair who helped me with my bags (he did not work the front desk) and a woman who worked the night shift--they were both friendly and helpful. Their attitude made a world of difference. Those two people should be promoted and working the day shift at the front desk!I will not be returning to this hotel. They lost me as a customer forever.","New York City, New York","lola</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",60,1.0

The hotel was very quiet and the sitting area near the reception is tranquil and has a good view. The single room I had was small but manageable.

The area is completely safe at night, the hotel building is modern, and I heard no sirens the whole time I was there. If you arrive by train, be aware that Tokyo station is large and has many different lines running through it. To get to the Yaesu North exit, you need to walk through the central hall for quite a way, in a not completely straight line. If you feel lost, look at one of the maps of the station, and you'll see where you are relative to the exit you need.

Water, very nice coffee/tea service, toiletries, robes,,,everything your need is provided at no additional cost...and it was all quality stuff. The bathroom had a great shower stall, which I preferred, but deep tub options more common in Japan were available in other room types if you prefer a tub option. The toilet was the most modern we experienced in Japan, which says a lot. I'm looking to purchase the very same model for my home now. Water pressure was adequate. Towels were typical for Japan (skinny), but of good quality. Toiletries were through the roof...all very nice. Pajamas, robes and slippers were provided. Room was cleaned and re-supplied daily. Currency exchange at the desk was provided and the rate quite acceptable. Staff spoke English and were courteous and helpful. Having no view did not deter from the experience at all. Vistas are available everywhere in Tokyo so not having one in the room really didn't matter. Tokyo Station has hundreds of dining and shopping options, but is quiet compared to other popular areas of Tokyo...which we found to be highly desirable. There is a restaurant in the hotel, but we dined off site exclusively.The only reason Ryumeikan did not receive 5 stars from us is there was no spa (steam/sauna/pool), but we had a very positive experience and will not hesitate in re-booking a stay there for our next visit to Tokyo.","Jacksonville, FL","travelguru54</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jacksonville, FL</strong>",69,4.0

We have no useable Japanese language and felt that no barrier whatsoever here. The staff ALL took so very much time and effort to help us ( well above the usual beautiful Japanese hospitality!). They helped to seek restaurant experiences and book them ( and navigate the trickier concepts of menu navigation and directions _ they actually printed itineraries and photos from google maps to try and help guide us). This was so of all staff, they were exceptional!Secondly the room we had was stunning. We chose the Japanese style room and slept the best we have in ages. It was beautifully appointed and little touches such as nespresso machine and free pods continually restocked, some complimentary drinks and seamless service was amazing, The bathroom needs special mention! Wonderful Japanese bath ( and shower) made it hard for us to actually consider leaving the room at all!Small but lovely little library with some cookbooks and gardening books that were good to leaf through.Must also say the laundry with free wash dry was perfect for the end of trip.So please do yourself a favour and stay here if you can, it is in the financial district (which always works for us as we like to see the beating heart of a city and to have quiet at night) and I cannot rate it highly enough.

In hindsight, I should’ve gone with my first choice in the heart of Ginza and where breakfast was included, and room rate would have been less expensive. Here at Ryumeikan, I was left feeling like I paid a lot for very little. The room is indeed microscopic and barely nil space to stack a suitcase spinner for one person, let alone a couple. No space for toiletry kits in the bathroom. Breakfast at the hotel’s restaurant was an additional (about) $23USD pp. Notes included in the original reservations were never acknowledged. The staff were functional and offered the expected level of customer service. It’s proximity to Tokyo Station also means an easy walk through to the Marunouchi side and then on to the Imperial Palace and Gardens. A less than 10 minutes walk brings you into the heart of the Ginza District and the Tsukiji Fish Market is about 25 minutes away, if walking at a brisk pace.

We also went to Tsukiji market for the auction and as it's too early for the tubes yet, we walked. It took us about 25mins so was not a problem at all and also avoided a crazily expensive cab ride. We have started and finished our 2-week long Japan trip, we stayed at this hotel in Tokyo for the first 3 nights and it was absolutely perfect. We had a Forus Semi-double designed comfort sleep room then - although tiny (just like most hotel rooms in Japan), we were not left for wanting anything more. They have the usual all signing and dancing TOTO toilets and a spacious shower cabin with a door that closes perfectly shut with a ventilator built in, which meant no more humid and musky bedroom after showers. They also provided kimono style pajamas, some shiseido cosmetics and 3 different types of pillows. It was also very quiet. We have gone back to the hotel for the last night and unknowingly got a standard bedroom. The cosmetics, design PJs and the buckwheat pillows disappeared, which would probably be predictable, but we had to ask for another room as the shower cabin was also not included, instead it was the old style shower curtain and tub, and without being able to open the window, the room was rather stinky. They did provide another room, that one refreshed so we can't complain. However we would have opted for the Forus room had we known that it would make a difference. Said that, we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. Additionally, there is a huge Daimaru with two levels of the most amazing food (from cakes to sushi to anything you could desire), which was perfect when we just wanted to pick up a few boxes of sushi or try (and be amazed) by all the different cookies and cakes.

So being unfamiliar with Tokyo, my priority was to find a hotel as close to Tokyo central station as possible so we wouldn't have to navigate too far away from where we got off the Narita Express.I quickly realized that there's a steep premium for this area of Tokyo, it's where many of the famous five star hotels are located. Among these high-falutin hotels was nestled the Ryumeikan. It's not cheap, but it seemed to represent much better value than those around it. So I booked a ""Standard"" twin room. This was a great decision!After crawling through the labyrinth of tunnels that is Tokyo Station, we emerged into the rain and scuttled along the street until we found the unassuming entrance of the Ryumeikan. The lobby is actually on the 15th floor and at ground level there's only an elevator... easy to miss actually.On the 15th floor the reception staff quickly checked us in, with decent English. Payment was required in advance and my Mastercard did the job.The ""standard"" room was great! As comfortable and spacious as any modern chain hotel. We particularly loved all the little touches like a fresh Yukata every day, fresh sleeping clothes every day, slippers, shoe/clothing deodorant, toe spreaders, foot massager, lots of face creams and amenities including shaving kit, face cream, decent shampoo and conditioner. The Japanese style short but deep bath was also great. The beds were a little firm for my wife, but perfect for me. Noise isolation was fantastic (or perhaps we had no neighbors for our 4 night stay). Wifi was fast, free and flawless, except for having to sign in again every day.We also had a good view over the main road towards the central station. Looking at the emergency escape map, it seems our standard room was actually much bigger than most of the rooms on that floor. I guess most of the rooms are catering to single business travellers, and if I'm right, those rooms don't even get a window.We also availed ourselves of the massage service, which was on time and efficient, right in our room (although I wasn't used to the Shiatsu massage style, but that's a different story).We did not take breakfast at the hotel. I couldn't bring myself to pay the equivalent of almost 25 USD per person per day for breakfast, not matter how good their spread is. Instead we used the Excelsior Cafe a couple of doors down for about 7.50 USD yen each for a nice coffee and toasted ham and cheese sandwich. All up, if I felt the need to stay so close to Tokyo Station again, Ryumeikan would be my first choice.

We had initially flown into Narita, but stayed in Shinjiku on the first leg of our trip, but for our last night we planned for low-hassle travel back to Narita. Hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo fit the bill. As many others have said, your nearly across from Tokyo Station, and taking Yaesu NORTH Exit best and most direct. Once outside cross the intersection, and go left for 1-to-2 minutes, you'll run right into the hotel, After entering the hotel, go through double-doors and take elevator to 15th floor (Lobby). *The Lobby has a great view, being on the 15th floor *Staff was very accommodating during check-in *Rooms clean & adequate in size, not huge by any means, but par for the course in Tokyo *Price fair (when we booked)CONS: * Staff member at check-out was a little less enthusiastic, when we asked to have our luggage held so that we could finish up a little last-minute gift shopping. Her face clearly went from pleasant to annoyed as soon as we asked *IF our luggage could be held, and she replied: ""I think So, but can you tell me about what time until you return?"". We had regularly asked this of hotels across Japan (and elsewhere in the world), this was the first time we were made to feel like we were inconveniencing hotel staff.OVERALL:  * Despite the attitude at check-out, we likely stay at this hotel again due to it's great location, adequate rooms, and fair price.","Louisville, Kentucky","SMcGowan36</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Louisville, Kentucky</strong>",49,4.0

Usually, it has been for a quick, one-night stop in Tokyo before taking the shinkansen to other destinations. But this time, I began my trip and ended my trip at the Ryumeikan; as a result, I was able to take fullest advantage of what the hotel has to offer for the first time.The location is ideal for train travelers. Exit Tokyo Station on the Yaesu side (best exit is the Yaesu north exit next to the Daimaru department store), cross the street, turn left and walk for a minute or so and you are at the front door. The moment you enter, the elevator lobby (reception is on the 15th floor) you are greeted by the scent of incense, the kind of elegant gesture which is characteristic of the property.Having previously stayed in the small but well thought-out standard single rooms, this time I chose the Forus rooms which are larger and more elegantly equipped with a Nespresso machine (and 8 capsules!), complimentary snacks, 4 bottles of water, high-end room slippers, robe and night shirt. Other nice touches included a foot massager, very nice green-tea scented toiletries, a great rain shower, and in the case of my Forus C room, an illuminated dry erase board for encouraging one’s creative side! Housekeeping kept the room immaculate and well stocked. If there was a downside, the room had no view; those who are strongly claustrophobic, take note.In addition to the reception desk, the 15th floor also has a lounge area with books to borrow as well as the hotel’s restaurant Hanagoyomi. My room rate included breakfast – a large, varied buffet of Japanese delicacies. Those looking for a western breakfast will be mostly disappointed but I found the food delicious and ate much more than I should have.As someone who has enjoyed many of Tokyo’s high-end hotels (I was a long-time devotee of the late, great Hotel Okura), my decision to stay at the Ryumeikan for my days in Tokyo was something of a lark. But I am glad I did. While not one of the city’s highest-end luxury properties, the Ryumeikan nevertheless provides its guests with caring, thoughtful hospitality in a prime location. I will be returning at my next opportunity.","Chicago, Illinois","lapyramide</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",38,5.0

None of that compared to my checkout experience. As I expected, my meetings concluded and I needed to check out early, and I told them that may happen when I checked in. I was driving back from a meeting and called the hotel around 11:15-11:30 to let them know I was checking out and would be there within a short time for the bill. They needed to credit my credit card for my other days. I arrived at the desk around 13:30. The girl I spoke to did not understand English enough to help me and wanted to charge me the entire next night, which I did not agree to. After some back and forth I asked for the manager and she hesitantly asked a man named [--] to try and assist. It took about 30 minutes of convincing him that I was not told about the cancellation policy when I checked in, and I mentioned the fact that I specifically asked about leaving early and was told I would just get a refund for the remaining nights. He finally gave in but insisted he charge me 7500 Yen for a late checkout because I had been standing there arguing with him. On top of that I was charged an entire night stay because I checked in around 10.30 am, so in total I was overcharged around 27,500 Yen.

However, this is simply not the case in reality. This hotel has the worst front desk service I've experienced in my recent years of travel.I got sick in my arrival unfortunately. In times, I'll ask the front desk for assistance, such as directions and room availability/rates if I want to extend my stay so I can rest. Some of the front desk staffs are pretentious and insincere. When ask a question, they have an annoyed/irritated look on their faces, despite their best attempt to hide it. And they gave me different information on room rates and availability everyday which made me very confusing. On 2nd day they told me there's zero room availability, but on the 3rd day I asked another staff, she offered me a much more expensive room for extended stay. I have no choice but to accept it and told them I will do the transaction next day.Later that night, my illness got worse and unbearable. I decided to cancel my extended stay and went to the airport to try get an earlier flight home. In the morning as I told them I'm leaving and would like to cancel the new room reservation, a female staff in her early forties was agitated. She raised her voice and talked to me in a harsh and hostile tone, blaming me for not telling her earlier and said that I would have to pay for cancellation charges in my future stay. I apologized and explained to her politely about my illness condition with my hoarse voice, she didn't even care and gave me a cold hard stare, then looking at her monitor with dead silence. No sympathy for a sick guest, no basic courtesy farewell to a paying guest. I took a glance at her before heading to the lift, saw her blabbering to her colleague about me. Very unprofessional and rude.I am extremely disappointed and disgusted by the services provided by hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo. Japan is a country well known for it's hospitality and manners, but sadly it doesn't exist in this hotel. I've strongly urged my friends and co-workers to stay in other better hotels near Tokyo Station, because I don’t wish anyone else to receive the poor treatment I had in Ryumeikan.","Singapore, Singapore","SorrowHill</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",1,1.0

There were bottles of water, snacks, and even a Nespresso machine with capsules -- perfect for a tired traveler who had just arrived. The room itself was very clean.

However we had nespresso coffee machine, two choices of night wear, complete set of toiletries for both men and women, which included skincare - we should not have bothered to pack ours. The bed came with mood music and lighting that got me engrossed and fiddling when I should be resting instead. We asked for humidifier and iron and ironing board to press our clothing. Not much space in the room to do this though. However the toilet and shower facilities were impressive, though there was no bath - which did not matter to us. Being presbyopic, however, it would help to make those bidet choices easier for non-kanji readers. Tokyo station was a stroll away. We were also informed of airport bus limousine to Haneda in a building across the road, which was very useful for us because it rained on our departure day. We saw quite a few people waiting at the bus stop in the open for a different company service. We came back to rest for another night when we came back from our 4 day stay at Toyama.

Started out as a couples trip but that changed when our daughter's due date conflicted with the trip. We went from a couple's trip to three guys. The schedule was Tokyo for 2,nights at the Palace hotel, 2 nights at the new Four Seasons in Kyoto then a plane ride from Osaka to the island of Hokkaido for 5 days of skiing. Who knew that skiing in Japan is awesome. We skied in Niseko, get the all mountain pass and have a great time. Lift tickets, rentals are cheap compared to the U.S. We had a guide each day, and it was worth it.So I digress, Tokyo was awesome, had a dinner at Nakahara, great grilled meats at the table,get the legendary Waygu beef tongue, have to order in advance, but it was phenomenal!! The Chef was born in the U.S. In San Jose then the family moved back to Japan when he was 4. Went to Sushi bar Yasuda. It is Yasuda-San, the Chef, his wife and their daughter, Junior, who take care of you. A great place to go, everyone wants to go to Jiro but this guy is the real deal. Narrow staircase to walk down to the restaurant but really worth it, and sit at the counter. He knows his sushi and his rice! Also in Tokyo, restaurant Takazawa, unbelievable 8-9 seat restaurant that is off the charts,if you can get in please go, and it is not cheap. And they have a crazy good wine list that Thatcher has put together. We had a 2014,Ramonet, a 2009 Lignier, and a 1988 Gaja speers. Cool place, cool people. They also have a bar downstairs if you want something a little more casual. Oh yeah, go by the fish market, Tsukiji and the shops/restaurants around it. And stop by the knife store, they hand make their knives and sell to Chefs...the name is Tsukiji Masamoto, I bought knives there and wished I had bought more.I was very impressed by the respect everyone shows to everyone else, and how clean the cities were. In Kyoto we had dinners at Kappo Sakamoto and Tempura Matsu. If you go you will experience Kyoto dining as no one else does. Tempura Matsu had a wonderful menu and only a couple of tempura dishes but they were light a delicious. Kappo Sakamoto was a total delight, a son, the Chef and his Mother run this small jewel of a place, maybe 6-9 seats at the counter, tough to find but enchanting.Hope you can enjoy what I did.All the best!!","Hillsborough, CA","refreshedtraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hillsborough, CA</strong>",16,5.0

The front desk people were really nice though and waived the kids' charge for the night (it would have come to about $500USD for a small twin room). But families should note this before booking.

So, we didn't have much to compare it to, other than hotels we've stayed in other countries. But now, having finished our 2 week trip to Japan, I can look back and say that this hotel was excellent. The staff were extremely kind and welcoming. Yet they were also pleasantly unobtrusive (other than the effusive greetings each morning at breakfast). I don't know what their breakfast buffet was like before they changed the menu in August, but we thought it was delicious. I was dealing with a chest cold, and their homemade chicken soup was perfect -- and something I didn't find at any other hotel we stayed at. The selection of Japanese dishes were all delicious -- I can expect that people wanting Western breakfast food would be a bit disappointed by the simple selection. The room was very well equipped; again, the best we encountered while in Japan. For example, they provided wash clothes, which we never encountered elsewhere. And the towels were quite large. We were given fresh bottled water every day -- this was very appreciated since I was trying to stay hydrated while I recovered from my cold. The yukata were very nice, again, the nicest we experienced on our trip. The location by the station was very convenient, but also managed to be a quiet place. Our room was a semi-double, and pretty small -- but we liked the compactness of it. Finally, this hotel had less of a businessman feel about it, with touches that made it feel more accommodating to women travelers, which I appreciated. The bed was very comfortable. I would like to make some adjustments to the Forus sleeping system so that the morning routine started with calmer music and vibration and the overhead lights didn't pop on so brightly, but the falling asleep routine was great.","Seattle, Washington","W774CTsharons</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",20,5.0

The toiletries provided in the bathroom were even better than those in most of the other lovely hotels we stayed at in Japan and the bathroom had one of the most elaborate shower arrangements I have ever seen. There was a fixed shower rose, a flexible hose outlet and 3 outlets shooting water horizontally onto your body. Then there was a top quality Japanese toilet with all the bells and whistles and water spouts and modesty sounds etc that we were becoming very fond of. The reception staff were very friendly and had a tiny amount of English which we appreciated as our Japanese was almost non existent despite our pathetic but heartfelt efforts. Apart from being very elegant it is close to a vast number of restaurants, Family Mart and department stores to buy food to take back to the room if you wanted to. We heartily recommend this hotel.","Noosa, Australia","hobart_10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Noosa, Australia</strong>",89,5.0

Many hotels in this area were averaging $500-700/night. Using Trip Advisor we found the Ryumeikan Hotel, an affordable little gem one street over from the Tokyo Station. It was in our price range ($200-300). I saw that it received great reviews but thought it would be a basic hotel. Was I ever pleasantly surprised! It was top notch, upscale. Excellent Japanese customer service at check-in (15th floor). Our room was compact and perfectly laid out, well-appointed with robes, slippers, bathroom amenities, complimentary snacks, teas, and a Nespresso coffee maker which is a personal favorite. Complimentary water bottles in the fridge. Bathroom was spa-like with glass walk-in shower with body sprayers and rainwater head in addition to a standard shower head. Wonderfully hot, high volume showers- excellent! Great shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Vending machine down the hall with inexpensive drinks of every kind, and clothes washer and dryer. You will find you have everything you need at this hotel. It is an easy walk to the Ginza, Imperial Palace, and Tokyo Station. Japanese restaurant on the 15th floor (we didn't try), good Victorian English pub next door, and plenty of food options at the Tokyo Station and vicinity. Lots of shopping opportunities nearby include the Maranouchi Shopping mall, Tokyo Station, and Ginza shopping district.Tip: To find the hotel from Tokyo Station, follow the signs for the North side Nihonbashi exit, go right on the main street Etai-dori, walk one street over. After crossing the street the hotel is the second building in to the right. Tip: Look up at the top of the buildings to see the giant RYUMEIKAN HOTEL sign, lit up in neon letters at night. Enter the building, take a left to the elevators, lobby is on the 15th floor. Our room said no view so I was expecting a widowless room, but ours did have a widow with natural light looking out at the building next door.The Ryumeikan Hotel was a pleasant surprise and a perfect stay.

The hotel service was brief as there is no interaction with reception on a daily basis due to its positioning on a high-floor of the hotel, however we found all amenities to be well looked after by the housekeeping staff and had no other issue or need to call reception. The location is desirable, meanwhile it did get rather cold travelling to and from the station exists, as expected in January. The rooms are basic however provide all the necessities that you require, and also have the automated Japanese toilets which is always a plus for visitors. I would recommend this hotel for those looking for a central base, that is not overpriced, within a respectable walking distance from transport and key destinations including Tokyo Station, Ginza district and the fish markets (while they remain at their current location)There are significant nearby amenities including starbucks, food court (across the street under Tokyo Station) and department stores. Further towards Ginza, the world is your oyster! Travelling to the hotel from the airport, I would advise getting on 1000yen shuttle bus that takes you directly to tokyo station rather than the usual airport limousine (because they stop at the same stop and the shuttle bus is cheaper for the same service)Travelling anywhere internally, I would recommend using Tokyo Station, or the surrounding stations, as required. It is a beautiful location for the Christmas and New Years period as Tokyo Station, Ginza and surrounding streets are lit up with lights and it is rather scenic.","Sydney, Australia","becsiri</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",24,5.0

You also have a combini next door, which is quite nice to buy some snacks in the morning.The first night was a bit suffocating. We had a really small room (it was the Standard Double Room) that faced a wall that was quite close (it seemed like it was 10 meters away tops, and the room was far from the sidewalk), therefore it was also extremely dark. The bed was tiny and had this weird sound and vibration system to wake you up (we didn't find a way to turn the alarm off). It did have a Nespresso machine, which was quite nice. We got used to the room and were a bit better the following and last night (during which we were in the Economy Double Room; it was a bit smaller, but at least it had a bit more of natural light).When dealing with the front desk staff, it felt as if they were doing you a favor whenever you talked to them (it was the only hotel in Japan I felt this way).

The three nights that we spent in Tokyo, we stayed at the Ryumeikan Tokyo Hotel and the experience from beginning to end has been very pleasant. After making the booking online, we got in contact with the hotel via email and asked them to please ensure that our room was non-smoking and away from smoking floors. The hotel responded within 2 hours indicating that our request was going to be granted. The first thing you notice when you reach the hotel is that the location is top. You are just a couple of minutes walking from Tokyo main train station (direct trains from Narita and Haneda Airports), Nihombashi subway, loads of restaurants to choose from and main attractions such as the Imperial Palace, Tsukiji fish market or the neighbourhoods of Shibuya and Akihabara are “around the corner”. On the hotel’s door step there is a nice restaurant, a couple of coffee shops and a 24/7 convenient store where you can grab a sandwich in the night if you are too tired and don’t fancy to dine in a restaurant. Reception is in the top (15th) floor. Upon arrival the staff is very pleasant, polite, and they speak English. The weather was cold, so receiving warm wet little towels to clean your hands and face was very welcoming and nice gesture from them. We booked one of the smallest versions of the possible configurations offered by the hotel; our room was located on the 14th floor. The room do not have wardrobe, but there is space enough in front of the the bed or in the room’s corridor to store your baggage (note that we carried two massive cases and handluggage!), so for us this was not an issue. The bathroom is also small, but practical and absolutely spotless. There is a little basket with loads of complimentary stuff such as shaving foam, aftershave lotions, bath salts, comb, brushes, toothbrush, toothpaste, headbands, cotton buds… and if you are missing something, the reception staff brings it to your room in no time. The bath is big enough and the flow of water in the shower is great, particularly after a long day walking around the city.The bed was of a decent size keeping in consideration Japanese’s bed standards. I had read reviews of hotels where the beds were really tiny. This is not the case in this hotel, where the two of us slept comfortably without bothering each other. Something I really liked was that the hotel provides a typical Japanese kimono/pyjama for you to use. It’s a nice gesture and gets you into their culture a bit; we found it fun to get them on. The room temperature can be regulated with a very easy to use thermostat located on the wall. I had read reviews of American tourists who found the air conditioned not good enough in Japanese hotels. We visited in winter, so I cannot comment on air conditioning as we made use of the heating; it worked fantastically leaving our room warm and lovely. The TV choice is not great, but you can purchase a TV card for films and stuff on demand. In the floor’s corridor there was also a self-service drinks dispenser and ice. Here is where you can also buy the TV on demand cards. The prices of the drinks are the same as the convenient store or the vending machines on the street, so it is good to see that the hotel do not take advantage of the service increasing the prices of the drinks. The room has safe to store your money, jewellery and documentation if needed. It also has a small fridge although I can’t remember if it had any drinks in it. There is also a kettle and a choice of complimentary teas and coffee. Every day they also put a couple of little bags of Japanese snacks that we found nice to eat during midday. Although we stayed in the tallest of the possible floors, the view wasn’t anything special. Again, this did not bother us at all, as we used the hotel simply to sleep and rest, and we spent all the time in the city out and about. WIFI is available and for free. Its speed and signal strength is well above standard. We did not stream music or films, but we were using chatting apps to catch up with friends and family and it worked absolutely fine. We also sent a few photos and checked email with no hassle at all. We can’t comment on the breakfast as we didn’t combine our room reservation with it. Instead we had breakfast on a Starbucks located literally 200 meters far from the hotel’s door. However the breakfast area on the 15th floor (next to the reception) looks fine. Check-out is at 11 am. The hotel asks you to return the card/keys of your room or you will be charged for them. Our flight out of Tokyo wasn’t until 23:00hrs so we asked the reception staff to look after our baggage, which they did for free and without any hassle, problem or hesitation (we did read some reviews of other hotels being funny about this, or even charging for leaving the baggage in reception, hence why we think is worth mentioning).Overall, a very pleasant and relaxing stay in a top hotel with a very reasonable rate per night.",Manchester,"Ferlondon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester</strong>",7,5.0

This is a fine hotel at the upper end of the business-hotel range in Tokyo. It is essentially across the street from the eastern side of Tokyo station and a couple blocks away from Nihonbashi — the zero-milestone for the nation. I found my 14th-storey room comfortable, quiet, and quite suitable for a busy vacation stay. Wi-Fi was fast, the in-room fridge works, and there is plenty of room. The bathroom is an efficient and fully equipped pre-fab. (You will find these in many Japanese hotels, and many people think them an improvement on Western hotel bathrooms.)The neighborhood is lively and good for eating, especially on a weeknight. But it's business-y more than charming. Local 24-hour activity will appeal to jet-lagged travellers. The hotel is convenient to many city attractions. And, importantly, Tokyo station is a departure point for the Narita Express and most shinkansen lines, and the eastern side is home to multiple malls and two major, upscale department stores. (Reminder to travellers: as in New York, Tokyo's main intercontinental airport, Narita, is about an hour from town. Only such grand cities can still get away with this inconvenience.)I recommend checking for deals (Tripadvisor will give pointers to the on-line booking agencies with the best rates). As of my trip, Japan is an affordable vacation destination for people from the U.S., UK, or Switzerland, due to favorable currency rates. I would stay at this hotel again. While it's not in my favorite Tokyo ward, the incredible convenience makes a swell base while exploring this biggest, most convenient, and perhaps most delicious of the world's conurbations.","Paris, France","slooone</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",16,4.0

After some time, I wanted to add another day to my stay and once again very prompt reply to my email confirming the same. The hotel website describes several room types in great detail. One must read this carefully to decide what type of room is required. We selected Forus type A- Discovery room. This was just enough for two of us. The room and the facilities provided are exactly as described -one hundred percent. Having stayed in several big cities- this is the best hotel I have stayed at. Booking, check in, staff and room facilities score ten out of ten. Location is brilliant- about 3-4 min walk from Yaesu north exit. Arriving on Narita Express, the walk inside Tokyo station is probably longer than outside! A Family Mart next door and a 7/11 shop in the side lane were useful.Reception desk is on the top floor-15F. Staff speak only working English. Everyone is extremely polite and very helpful. The mini fridge in the room was empty and very useful to keep drinks, yogurt, fruits etc. 4 bottles of mineral water every day in the room almost met our daily needs. Tap water is also of very good quality. Tokyo was really hot- 33 degrees and the ice machine on our floor was also very useful. We did not use the washing machine and dryer but I have seen it in use regularly. Rooms were exceptionally clean. Very regular provision of all toiletries and coffee machine supplies. My wife is now a fan of the Nespresso machine. Wi-fi was very good for connection and speed. We could comfortably use Skype, Facetime and whatapp calling in addition to usual Internet use. They had a good selection of award winning post cards in the room which they posted free for us!Very good toilet. Shower is the best I have seen anywhere. A bit amused by the electronic WC! We travelled a lot on Yamanote line and Shinkansen using JR pass and found the proximity of this place to the station very useful even during heavy rain.There were no problems in the form of – room key card not working, poor quality air conditioning, wifi not connecting, weak shower, inadequate lighting in the room, billing mistakes etc- at least one of these problems I have come across every hotel in the world- but this place is just perfect. Overall a brilliant hotel for location, staff, room, amenities and cost. Can not fault them for anything and really surprised as to how they keep everything perfect every day with courtesy and smile! Would happily stay again.","Leeds, United Kingdom","LeedsXray</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leeds, United Kingdom</strong>",54,5.0

We loved everything about it... well maybe we didn't love the ""potty porthole"" but that was an epic thing to send photos home about.If you are looking for excellent service, a centrally located home base in Tokyo, and a comfortable room, then this is the place for you!Everything was very modern and very clean. The room, as is typical in Japan, was very small. If you have a ton of luggage, you are going to need to store it and we were told you can ask the front desk how to do this. We only had 2 medium bags and these fit well in the room. There are tons of places to eat, places to shop, and every single mode of transportation in Tokyo within a 5 minutes walk of this place.THIS INCLUDES THE EXPRESS BUS TO NARITA AIRPORT! The Tokyo Station bus stop is a few hundred feet from the front door. Don't bother paying more for the JR Train to Narita if you stay here. This was faster and more convenient, unless you just prefer trains there is no reason to spend more for less.The front desk staff were extremely good at their jobs. They made an instant friend in me when we arrived on an extremely hot day and they noticed I was sweating. They got me an ice-cold towel and a dry one to wipe off with. Check-in and check-out were smooth.We stayed here on both ends of our trip to Tokyo. Both experiences were superior.We requested a second set of pillows (they have multiple kinds of pillows to choose from) be delivered to our room on the first night of the first visit and when we arrived for our second visit, the person checking us in mentioned to us that they had taken the liberty of putting 2 extra pillows (the type we had chosen the first time) in our room already. THAT is a perfect example of rock star service. It was a tiny thing that meant nothing, but also meant a great deal to us.They had slippers you were allowed to take with you and some biscuit/cookie things. There was a mini fridge and complimentary water each day. The room was cool and everything was in perfect working order. The restroom was large enough, the shower was excellent with solid water pressure, and they provided at least 2 dozen different toiletries for your use.We were so glad we chose this hotel... twice.The potty porthole is something you have to see for yourself, though.

But this one comes out on top, in terms of value, location, and the comfort. We booked their Forus A one, which was adequate space and perfect for 2 people (with 2 suitcases). The Nespresso machine and the cool wake-you-up-with-music bed were pretty cool. The toilet has all the bells and whistles you would expect from a good Japanese hotel. We never heard any noise while in our room either - amazing noise proof rooms! We booked via their website directly and the 30% off if you book 30 days in advance would give you a really good deal. The location is unbeatable. Given our trip involved use of the shinkansen (Bullet train), we simply love being near the Tokyo Station. As many other reviewers have said, getting to and from airport was also a breeze, be it that you use the Narita Express, or even easier if you use the Narita Highway bus which has a bus stop basically 10-20 metres out of the hotel door (right outside Excelsior the cafe). We arrived by Narita Express and left via the highway bus, as the highway was not only super handy if you have a bit of luggage (Tokyo Station is still a 5 minute walk), it's also super cheap at 1000 Yen. It took us 50 minutes from memory to get to Narita, which was very comparable to Narita Express. You would also find yourself always near lots of food and shop. We went to the First Avenue mall at the basement level of Daimaru Department Store a lot. We like the Tokyo Ramen Street there - about 6-7 different stalls offering ramen from various regions in Japan. Also lots of souvenir stores to get toys for kids - Hello Kitty, Star Wars, Disney - you name it. You are also about 15 minutes' walk from Ginza, where you would have endless shopping option like the magnificent 11 floor Uniqlo, Muji, Ginza hands (better than the Tokyo Hands at Daimuru), Zara, GAP...This is really a gem.","Wellington, New Zealand","travelyun</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",223,5.0

You will be spoilt for choice on the restaurants surrounding the area. There is a Family Mart convenience store just around the corner, so if you want a quick and cheap snack, then you can go here 24/7.Getting here: You have a choice of taking the bus limousine or the express trains from Narita airport. If you are carrying a large luggage, it would be easier to take the bus, even though it willtake a longer time due to traffic congestions. The Keisei airport bus (blue and white bus) stop is a few steps away from the hotel. The stop is ""Tokyo Station Yaesu Gate"". The Airport Bus Limousine (orange bus) stop is a bit farther, about 300meters. The stop is ""Tokyo station, Yaesu South Gate"". If you prefer to take the JR Narita Express, then you exit the JR Tokyo station through the Yaesu North Exit, and cross the street to reach the hotel, which is about 100meters away. However, be warned that the Tokyo station is huge and if you are very bad with maps and directions, it might not be the best option for you. The hotel reception is at the 15th floor, so at the entrance all you would see is the lift on your left and another entrance to offices.Rooms: as with any other Japanese accomodations, most of the rooms in the hotel are small. You can check their website to have an idea. I opted to book the Double Room to have a bigger space, but because it is limited, they only have the smoking room available. However, they were nice enough to ""sanitize the room"" and got rid of any residual smell. I wouldn't have known it was a smoking room if they had not told me beforehand. The bed is firm, and there are two types of pillows, soft and firm. I love that the toilet is separated from the bath. You do not need to worry about toiletries because they have a generous supply of bath/shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, make-up cleanser and facial wash and moisturizer (all Shisheido), facial wash and hair wax for men, razor and shaving foam, toothbrush and toothpaste, brush and comb, and a disposable towel for scrubbing yourself. They have a deodorizer for the shoes and clothes that you will keep in the closet. The double room also comes with Nespresso and free capsule refills, japanese crackers, and tea. Complimentary wifi is stable and fast.Facilities: There is a coin operated washer and dryer on the 10th floor, and an ice machine and vending machine for drinks. Breakfast: The buffet breakfast is mainly Japanese style. Their bread and cereal selection is very limited. If you don't prefer this, then you can choose to go to Starbucks nearby or to the Tokyo station underground for other choices.Service: The hotel staff have limited English skills but understandable. The reception is well-stocked with vicinity maps and are very helpful if you need directions going somewhere. You can also ask them to write the destination in Japanese, so if you want to take a taxi, then you can just show the destination written by the hotel staff for you.Value: Tokyo hotels are expensive in general, but for the location, service and amenities, I believe it is money well spent.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","gbytes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",49,5.0

I will do my best to keep it objective.The good:- LOCATION. The bus from the airport leaves you right at the front. Tokyo main train station is one block away. From there you can go everywhere in Japan. Main bus station is also at walking distance. Restaurants, pubs convenience stores and a good coffee shop with with coffee two doors away.- It is quiet. I did not hear the city noise.- They have a coin washing machine and dryer (as well as laundry service) The washing machine a cheap and convenient option. - One thing I personally like, what is is the room you can eat or drink without extra charge.- The bathroom is well stocked. Even nice bath salts. The toilet seats are amazing!- The bath is nice- The rooms are very clean- Check in and out is simple. And they provide assistance in english- The WiFi works wellThe bad:- The pillows are hard- The rooms are small - but this is standard in Japan.- There is a window in the bathroom that looks into the bedroom. This could be awkward for families.For you to decide:- It is in a business district. It is a safe area. - I can't make much comment on the service. Because I like my privacy when I travel and this hotel was really good at respecting mine. If you decide to stay here and you like sweets go to Daimaru across the road. They have a huge variety of desserts. Even just to watch the attention to detail in them is worth crossing the street. There is a lot to see just around the hotel.","Melbourne, Australia","Oz_Star_18</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",19,5.0

The hotel accommodation starts quite a few floors above street level, so on entering the hotel building, turn left through the double glass doors and take the lift to reception, it really is that easy and you really do not need a taxi unless you have a lot of luggage.Our room for 5 nights was excellent, it had been thoroughly cleaned and we had no complaints whatsoever. A simple call to reception brought any items that you were in need of.Tokyo JR station is a stop on all the Shinkansen lines and is also a stop for express, local and underground trains.We had room only (without a meal option) as the breakfast for 2 people amounted to £28 ($US 42) per day and there is a convenience store just a few steps from the hotels entrance.

There's only one element we'd have loved to see a little bit better.Location: 2 minute walk to Tokyo Central Station Yaesu entrances. Also only a 5 minute walk to get into the middle of Ginza, where you can do nice sightseeing stuff and go shopping.Room:Some may find hotel rooms in Tokyo small, but not the Forus B room, in our opinion. They're not particularly big, but very nicely and practically arranged and furnished. The bed ""experience"" is fun and relaxing, having a wake up system with light, music and vibrations. The shower area is very nice, spacious, luxurious (waterfall shower), and pretty much sound proof. There's no bath, but we prefer showers in hotel rooms anyway, so it was perfect for us. The photos on the hotel website give a good impression of the Forus rooms.Amenities:The Nespresso coffee maker is such a nice extra, as is the melodious water cooker ;) There's also a small refrigerator. Every day four 500ml water bottles were made available, and tea bags and coffee cups were restocked. While we were there, every day a postcard from an art collection was made available which the hotel staff posted for us at no cost for postage. The only thing we would have liked in the room would be a safe to store stuff while we went out. We loved the Japanese pyjamas and kimono, which we wore every day when we got ""home"" and were replaced every morning when the room was done. We would have been just as happy to have used the same set all days of our stay, but it did indeed feel very luxurious to have clean ones every day. The free wifi was fast.Soundproof:As the hotel website states, the Forus B rooms are sound proof. Ours was indeed, we were very pleasantly surprised by it. To be in the middle of such a hectic city with the traffic and all, it was very quiet. We also did not hear anything from other hotel guests at any point. Perfection.OK, so one little point of improvement we think would have made our stay more perfect than perfect: if all of the staff at the reception desk would speak a decent amount of English. Some did, but some could hardly put a sentence in English together and that is something we would have expected at a hotel we think receives many international guests.Other wise, if you wish to be near the train station and also near shops and touristy things and you like the feeling of being pampered: this really is the place to go!","Utrecht, The Netherlands","Hesterrr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Utrecht, The Netherlands</strong>",6,5.0

The best thing about the hotel was the location: it is more or less opposite Tokyo Station, which made it very convenient for a variety of different travel purposes, including arrival from Narita when you are really tired. The room was quite generous for Japan, and very nicely fitted out. The bed was comfortable, and had a clever console for controlling lights and other stuff. The bathroom was neat and clean, with everything you expect at a good Japanese hotel. There are two downsides. It is true that outside the window, about a metre away, was a concrete wall. There is no point in opening the curtains to look out, as there is literally nothing to see but some concrete. But, for the quality of the room and the price, we thought that was OK. Who wants to stay all day in their room anyway. The other odd thing is that the reception and restaurant is at the top of the building, and the rooms below. That meant that after we checked in, we didn't go to the reception again until we left to check out, four days later. So there isn't much 'hotel' atmosphere. You could be anywhere. However, you are actually in Tokyo, and the hotel is very well located for some delicious dinners. We ate very well in the Daimaru restaurant floors, almost opposite the hotel in Tokyo Station, and also at a range of great places in Coredo Muromachi, about five minutes away, including a great intestines restaurant called Hakata Motsunabe Yamaya in Coredo 2. All the shops and restauramts of Ginza are walkable from here too (we had a great dinner at Birdland, and a great martini in the Secret Bar at Dover Street Market).",London,"lyfliyfhv</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",15,4.0

I have stayed at dozens of different hotels in Tokyo - the Palace, the Imperial, the Okura, the Daiichi, the Marunouchi - but none of them come close to the excellence of the breakfast buffet here. What is so impressive about the food is that it's totally fresh, healthy & authentically Japanese. They have a fresh vegetable shabu shabu, make-your-own ochazuke with fresh dashi, even a bowl of tororo on the side. The day I ate, they had exquisitely simmered nisshin, renkon dusted with tobiko, a seasonal bowl of tara (cod) with shirako. In other words, if you're looking for cornflakes or bacon & french fries for breakfast, don't come here. But if you want to experience the real Japanese ""omotenashi"", this is the greatest hotel breakfast in town.

The rooms were always clean, well-maintained and equipped; in all three rooms I have stayed, there was an electric kettle with coffee and tea that housekeeping replaces everyday, an air conditioning system that you can actually control, a desk with easily accessible plugs to charge your devices, a small fridge, but no iron or ironing board (I bet all you have to do is ask the front desk). Another nice feature of the room is the fact that you can actually open the window a little. There's not much of a view depending on the room you stay, but the fresh air is certainly welcome. The staff at Ryumeikan is very friendly and won't hesitate to help you, whether you speak Japanese or not. During my second stay in the hotel, I forgot a phone charger in my room. A week or so later, when I went back the hotel for my third stay, I asked about the charger, and it was delivered to my room. A very nice service and commitment to the guest, considering they kept the charger for more than a week without me requesting them to do so.The location is ideal for people coming to Tokyo for both business and leisure. At the backside of the hotel, as you walk towards Ginza, you will find bars, restaurants, shopping malls, and convenience stores (there's one next to the hotel as well). Tokyo Station itself became a huge shopping mall. You'll find restaurants, gift shops, drugstores and all kinds of retailers for any kind of emergency. Needles to say that getting around Tokyo and other regions of Japan is very easy with all the JR and Metro lines serving the station.If you're coming from Narita airport, the bus to Yaesu is a good option. Yaesu is the last stop of the itinerary, and you'll be just a 3 minutes walk away from the hotel, without having to deal with the escalators or elevators that you would have to face if you take the train (a hustle if you have a suitcase). There is a Keisei bus line that departs to Narita airport right from the hotel entrance too.

While it is one of the smallest hotel rooms we've ever stayed in, Hotel Ryumeikan makes up for the size in a big way. Staff is very friendly and, thankfully for us, English speaking. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom is more than adequate. It has the fancy Japanese toilet with heated seat, deodorizer, built-in bidet with two settings. The shower has great water pressure; nice and hot immediately. Provided for you is also a tray of all the bathroom amenities one could ask for including bath salts, sanitizing wipes, and a hair band. In addition, laid out on your bed are two sets of pajamas (which my husband loved) and two beautiful turquoise kimonos with yellow obis (which we both loved). Although the room seemed to have everything you could need, we quickly noticed that there was no ironing board or iron. After breakfast one morning we left a comment card in the suggestion box in the hallway asking for an iron. Much to our happy surprise, the iron and board were waiting in our made-up room when we returned to freshen for dinner. What service! The hotel offers all kinds of extras like this such as nightlights, footbaths, and massagers which will be delivered to you upon request, free of charge. Laundry is also available for a mere 100 yen a load.The location of this hotel is spectacular. It is a short walk to the Ginzu area with lots of shopping and dining and it is basically across the street from Toyko Train station which is very convenient. There are also tons of restaurants to choose from because this busy business district caters to all of the hungry suits that have to take a meal before returning home. You could probably go to a different place to eat each night for a year and still miss a few. It is amazing. Everything is pretty much a short train ride away if you want to go to another district.Hotel Ryumeikan is highly recommended. We would certainly stay here again!",,meehabunny,45,5.0

We did not eat breakfast there and opted instead for a very light breakfast at a coffee shop two doors south of the hotel.

It is a three minute walk from Tokyo Station, there is a Familymart convenience store right next door and lots of affordable restaurants nearby. We encountered Typhoon Phanfone during our stay there and the train to Disneyland wasn’t working and all the buses had gone for the day. This was a problem because we had pre bought fixed day tickets. The staff at Hotel Ryumeikan called up Disneyland for us to confirm whether they were open and we ended up taking a taxi to Disneyland, which was not very crowded due to the trains being closed so the longest we had to wait for the rides was 15 minutes. We are very grateful to Hotel Ryumeikan for their help with this! Lots of other nice touches – we returned back to the hotel for our last night in Japan and found they had kept the drink and food we left in the room because we couldn’t pack it with us, and they had refridgerated the goods so they were nice and cold! This was beyond our expectations. It was our 4th wedding anniversary and they provided a small bottle of complimentary champagne, which was very nice as having a 3 year old, it’s hard to celebrate or be romantic anymore. They helped us book a transfer back to the airport. After the first night, housekeeping were perceptive enough to pick up that there were three of us so amenities were provided for three rather than two and my little one was very pleased with his slippers with a picture of a whale on them, complimentary of the hotel!

The location is excellent, rooms are nice and we always appreciated the little welcome packets you get with tokyo map etc. Service was always professional and good as well. However, the last trip i was dissapointed with the service of the front desk. I was waiting in the lobby in the evening, where they have some free tea to try, and noticed the watercooler was empty. I asked the front desk if i could make some tea, and staff seemed reluctant to help. Eventually a guy showed up to replace the water and i thanked him nicely since it seemed heavy but he just looked at me blankly and left. So it felt like this was a great nuisance to him, and that was unpleasant. Not a big deal maybe but since there are so many nice hotels in the area there´s no need to stay at one where some staff don´t care to make an effort.",Stockholm,"EmiliaStockholm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm</strong>",54,2.0

Everything was spic and span, and despite being right in the center of town the room had absolute silence, making for very restful sleep. The front desk spoke excellent English and were very accommodating and kind. The food at the in-house restaurant was lovely, but there are almost no western options so if you are someone who needs toast and eggs for breakfast, I advise you to walk to nearby Tokyo station. The location can't be beat - the Keisei bus from Narita drops you off literally half a block away from the hotel (1,000 Yen each way), and both the subway and the JR train stations are very, very close by. The hotel is within walking distance to the Imperial Gardens, and right across the street from a Daimaru department store.When I made my reservation I mistakenly booked only three nights, rather than the four I needed. When I called the front desk to extend my reservation, they were very accommodating about the extension, sent me a very detailed English email in confirmation, and even extended the original discount I had from booking to the 4th night, which I had neither expected nor asked for, so I was very, very happy about that.I will be sure to book this hotel on any return trips to Tokyo.","Seoul, South Korea","Seoulite2013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seoul, South Korea</strong>",19,5.0

Room also came with extremely comfortable and easy-to-clean slippers that they encourage you to take with you.One-time pay-to-watch system with a decent variety of movies and ""couples movies"". Vending machines on each floor and detergent-inclusive laundry/drier machines on a few select floors (at a reasonable price).Restaurant on the lobby floor, but they were booked for two days ahead. Plenty of casual eats at the Tokyo Station shopping area, however, and more on the street behind Ryumeikan.The beds were extremely comfortable as well. And the extra sofa-area was nice for meals. One note would be that you can't really see the TV from the sofa without moving the sofa, which we did not try. We also did not try moving the TV, which from the site's layout, looks like could have been a possibility.They also have interesting literature ranging from modern architecture to modern furniture. You can also buy the yukata, robe, hair products and other goods directly through the hotel.CONCLUSION-------------------Very relaxing stay and friendly staff, would highly recommend for young traveling couples.","New York City, New York","Sophie C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",8,5.0

We booked a basic room which was a great value for the Tokyo Station area. Our only compliants were the minuscule size of the room which barely accommodated 2 average large Americans and the fact that the room lacked a closet or any type of drawers which made it necessary to live out of our suitcases, not an easy task given the size of the room. I may have had a smaller room once in a hotel on the Left Bank in Paris many years ago but I really think this one was smaller. Otherwise, what the other reviews say about the positives of this hotel are pretty much reflected in our experience. A 10 minute walk from Tokyo Station where you can get the JR Rail circle line around the city to connect to any subway line in the city (buy tickets based on the fare to your destination at the automated ticket machines which have a large map in English and Japanese above the machines), a bullet train, or the express train ( reserved seating train or unreserved seating train, but tickets at the JR Rail office in the station) to Narita. There is also an express bus to Narita right in front of the hotel ( buy tickets in the Family Mart store). The streets across from the station and adjacent to the hotel are full of cafes,, a Starbucks, bars, and Karaoke places. It was bustling after work and during the dinner hour. On the other side of Tokyo Station (Marunouchi side) you can see the architecture of this beautiful but mammoth brick building and there are several upscale shopping malls with great places to dine. the hotel room was spotless, had a firm but comfortable bed, a high tech bathroom, slippers, robes, all the nice little touches. The front desk staff mostly were partially English speaking and were wonderful in helping us make dinner reservations, book a tour to Mt Fuji, get a cab at 3am to the tuna auction, or recommend places to visit. We used the coin laundry which was handy. Did not eat in the hotel restaurant on the top floor but there is an English pub on the first floor which was a nice happy hour place.

Also, the capital of Japan. Every thing is Green. Even a greenhouse. But, there are one hotel for me is the best. It is 41/2 stars on Booking.com. It's the Ryumeikan Hotel Tokyo. From the hotel walked to the JR line ( Tokyo Station ) it's just 5 - 10 minutes. So anyway, the receptionist is very kindly and helpful and very enthusiasm. The room is clean and neat. Ok. From floor 15, you can sightseeing the Tokyo. But be careful. In the elevator they have a key card sensor. We can only go to floor 15 or go down to floor 1 without using card. When you have the key card, it just from floor 8 to floor 15 and floor 1. Floor 2,3,4,5,6,7 is the office. You must know that what room is your floor is floor 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 or 13 or 14. It is automatic. Now, let's talk about the bathroom. Very nice. The toilet is automatically too, you know. The shampoo, Conditioner, Body Soap is green tea flavored. The bed is also comfortable. Ok. Let's talk a bout the review others write. There is a person named ' suncityga ' . His review is ' Great location to sightsee in Tokyo '. The first thing is that hotel is not for sightsee. It just a nice view. Not that can see all of the Tokyo.

For what I needed my last trip, Tripadvisor recommended just the right hotel in Shibuya. This trip I was bringing my son with me and I wanted the best hotel I could find near Tokyo Station and we wanted to stay fifteen nights. Clearly, from reading many reviews, the Hotel Ryumeikan was the best hotel in the area and the most reasonably priced. I was not disappointed! We were more than comfortable in our large room for two weeks!I emailed the Hotel Ryumeikan directly to make my reservations about five months before I planned to stay in April 2014. I received excellent service when I requested a Corner Deluxe Twin room on the 12th floor (to be near the laundry, because we would be there two weeks). I think I was able to get this room easier because I made my reservations quite early and the staff was quite helpful. The Hotel Ryumeikan email correspondence with me exceeded my expectations and enhanced my enthusiasm for the trip. During the last few weeks before we planned to travel, I wrote the staff at the Hotel Ryumeikan and requested that they order two cell phones. I also asked for information regarding a nearby driving range for my son. I received an email back recommending four driving ranges (2 with English websites and 2 Japanese only websites). I neglected to write back and say thank you as I should have done, and when we checked in at the front desk the hotel staff handed me printouts of the webpages I needed for the closest driving ranges. They also gave me the two cell phones I ordered and explained how to use them. The driving range was quite close by Tokyo standards, and so high tech that it was a lot of fun for us. We stayed in room 1203, which looked exactly as pictured on the Hotel Ryumeikan website. The room was immaculate when we arrived (and kept that way by the hotel staff each day). It was the perfect room for our long stay. The closet was large enough to hold my clothes on one side and my son’s clothes on the other. We used the hotel dry cleaning service two or three times and also the laundry which was right down the hall. The service provided by the Hotel Ryumeikan staff was outstanding in every possible way. We also ate some evening meals in the Hotel Ryumeikan dining room on the fifteenth floor and received excellent meals and service. They even accommodated some special diet needs a couple of nights. When we asked at the front desk about how to go someplace in Tokyo, they always were able to pull a map out of a drawer and show and tell us the best trains or subways to take to our destination. Because we did not always understand how to do something, a few times I know they did far more for us than we deserved, and they solved every concern that I had about anything. We were able to print out our boarding passes for our airline at the computer at the front desk with some help from the staff. And, the hotel staff helped us buy our tickets for the bus to return to the airport (the place to board the bus is a very short walk from the Hotel Ryumeikan entrance). Having taken the Narita Express, I prefer the bus to the Narita Express because I like to see the scenery from the bus better than from the train. The staff knew we had a language barrier with regard to our very limited Japanese, so they made an extra effort to help us feel comfortable by helping us do some things we could not do by ourselves; such as, read the directions for printing out our boarding passes and buying our bus tickets.I have stayed in other hotels in Tokyo and other places in Japan, and just as other Tripadvisor reviewers have stated, the Hotel Ryumeikan is one of the best, if not the best, hotel in Tokyo. I highly recommend the Hotel Ryumeikan to travelers of any age, from young adults to senior citizens (we saw people of all ages and nationalities at the hotel). The nearby Tokyo Station makes travel easy to almost anywhere inside or outside of Tokyo, and the Hotel Ryumeikan staff could answer every question and meet every reasonable need we had. If I ever need to be in Shibuya again, I will only stay in the Hotel Ryumeikan and take the train. To summarize, I believe the Hotel Ryumeikan is worth a 10 star rating!","Edmond, Oklahoma","LGP247</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmond, Oklahoma</strong>",7,5.0

There is nothing special about the room. As expected.....small and no opening of the windows. Our room window faces a concrete wall from the next building which blocks out most of the sunlight. The bed is longer than normal....which is good and bad. The Forus system with music and vibrating feet area isn't quite useful for us. The bathroom is good in size and has all the necessary amenities. The only bad thing is that there is no place to hang your clothes in the bathroom. Well there is also extremely little space to hang your clothing in the room. Therefore, there is no place to hang your laundry after washing. Thumbs up on the bathing system! The water pressure is so strong, making bathing time shorter and very enjoyable. There is more than enough space to move around in the bath area. Providing a seat in the bath area is very thoughtful.The staffs at the concierge provides passive services. They did not recommend us places to go or eat around the area. You have to ask them everything from laundry, laundry detergent, and airport bus bookings. Well....at least they always try their best to help find answers to our questions and their English is quite good for Japanese concierge staff.The Check-out time is at 11am which is the normal check out time for most hotels in Tokyo. However, some hotels are nice enough to allow free an hour or two later checkout time (if they have enough rooms before the next guest check in). This hotel only allows late checkouts if you are willing to pay for it. They charge 2,200JPY for 2 guests per room/ per hour.The bus to Narita airport is just a few steps away from hotel lobby and the bus ride takes a little more than an hour to get to the airport. The hotel only accepts 2 days advance booking for the airport bus. So, make sure you do book it in advance otherwise you many not be able to get a seat.Overall, this hotel is above average but not excellent.

From other tripadvisor reviews, I decided to choose Hotel Ryumeikan based on the positive reviews from other travelers. Without expecting much, the entire duration of my stay at Hotel Rymeikan was one that has left me of fond memories of Tokyo, a place to recommend to others and stay for future visits. The rooms may be small but that's expected of Tokyo but they had everything we needed and was comfortable and clean. Even the amenities were of high standard and was always fully stocked. The laundry facilities (both washer and dryer, no need to buy detergent either) were a lifesaver, while there were vending machines on every level. The hotel had free wifi which was a great bonus and there was even a smoking room by reception so you didn't have to go outside or find a 'smoking area' (Japan has strict laws on smoking and it can only be done in designated areas). As for location, the hotel is less than a 5 minute walk to Tokyo station. From here you can pretty much get anywhere and was helpful when we took the Shinkansen to Kyoto and Hiroshima. If you needed to shop, you could pretty much find what you needed at Tokyo station and if not, it was only a short walk or train ride away. But what stands out at this hotel is the customer service. From the moment we checked in the customary Japanese hospitality was evident and throughout the whole stay there was nothing the staff would not go above and beyond to help us with.

That was great because I was exhausted from that side-trip with our family. what can i say that others have not or that i have in my 1st review?Great place. Great location. Very comfortable room. Laundry facilities. It's all there. The one thing that i would say is that the female staff seem to be more warm and friendlier if you need to speak to someone more fluent in English. Otherwise. Another great stay. We'll be back again!For anyone who cares: The McDonalds that was in the Yaseu underground has closed. The one person helping me at the front desk told me there was no McDonalds anywhere near the hotel and just circled near by areas with restaurants. This was more for my little girl who wanted her Mcdonalds breakfast. There actually is a McDonalds at the south exit of Tokyo station.

Both rooms were exceptionally clean and had amenities you normally will not find in other business hotels. When you book, they will ask if guests are male or female. I did not understand the need for this until we were in our room. The triple room had Shiseido facial kit while my brother's room had amenities for men -- a proper coat rack, toiletries for men, etc. Both rooms even had traditional Japanese foot massager (complete with instructions and benefits of it) that has proven to be a life saver after a long day of walking. The triple room also had a Nespresso machine with enough coffee capsules to keep us up round the clock! Traditional Japanese rice crackers were also provided. The triple room had a good view of the Tokyo Station which was a plus. Its location is hard to beat. At the price you pay while staying a mere 5 minutes from the biggest station in Japan is hard to beat. Their website offers 30% discount when booked at least 1 month in advance. I booked mine 6 months ahead which is just the right thing to do especially when travelling during peak periods of Spring, Summer and Autumn. By the time I booked my 2nd room 2 months before my check-in date, they only had 2 single rooms available. There are numerous restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Tokyo Ramen Street in Tokyo Station will always be an option. There is a very cheap neighborhood place that serves decent enough Tonkatsu and Ramen a street away from the hotel entrance (as you walk towards the station). This is at the corner of the street lined with Cherry Blossom trees. They serve a big bowl of ramen for Y300 which is the cheapest meal I have had during our 14-day trip. The tonkatsu I think cost Y450. During our visit, the sakura was in bloom and the street looked amazing. Everything is accessible from Ryumeikan. There is also an option to take the Airport Limousine Bus and the station is maybe 10 steps away from the hotel entrance. I cannot comment on the food served at the hotel as we did not have the chance to try them. ALthough I did notice that they have complimentary tea and coffee making facilities at the lobby which was a nice touch when waiting for check-in or waiting for departure after check-out.We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Tokyo.","Manila, Philippines","MarqSterneTours</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",11,5.0

The Nihombashi stop on the Ginza, Tokai and Marunouchi lines of the Tokyo Metro is just around the corner (turn out of the hotel to the right, turn right at the corner and keep walking until you see the entrance). Maruzen, the premier bookstore, stationery and pen emporium, is just down the street from the subway stop, as is the great department store Takashimaya. If you go down into the subway, you can be at Ginza Crossing in a few minutes. The Tsukiji Fish Market requires a transfer at Monzen-nakacho, but the whole trip can be done in a jiffy.The restaurant on the 15th floor across from reception is good for a typical businessman's lunch buffet (very reasonable at 1,500 yen). I did not eat breakfast here, opting instead for sushi at Tsukiji Market every day.This was my third trip to Tokyo, but my first stay at Ryumeikan. I will never stay anywhere else in Tokyo.","Brooklyn, New York","David B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",157,5.0

Being right next to Tokyo Station makes exploring almost all areas of the city extremely convenient, not to mention being able to walk to many fantastic attractions nearby. Tokyo Station itself is a great resource as well - Ramen ""street"" alone provided several amazing meals, along with other food and shopping options that we found quite useful and fun. (Side note - get a JR rail pass if you're traveling anywhere else in Japan like Kyoto, because in addition to paying for itself with that one trip, you get unlimited use of the JR subway lines in Tokyo, which significantly reduces the stress of trying to get around the city).Because of cost/availability, my wife and I ended up in a room with two double beds (a little odd for us, but maybe good for others), but the room had plenty of space for us and our luggage - not necessarily all that easy to find in Japan. The shower/bath setup is a little awkward, though the water pressure was amazing. The staff couldn't have been nicer, though they weren't exempt from the language/cultural communications barriers that exist everywhere in Japan for westerners (maybe especially Americans).All of that said, it's not a luxury hotel. It's very nice, clean, and quiet (despite being in a business/downtown area with construction right across the street), but it's not fancy. We were happy to come back to relax after our days of wandering the city, but it wasn't a place we wanted to hang out.Overall - if you want a very comfortable place to use as a home base while exploring Tokyo, Hotel Ryumeikan is perfect.","Menlo Park, California","CalebWeaver</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Menlo Park, California</strong>",5,5.0

The hotel is within a couple of blocks of the Tokyo Train Station and you can reach multiple JR lines here, including the bullet trains which was key for us since we were coming in from Kyoto. If you're coming from Tokyo Station just find the Yaesu North exit and go left. You'll find the hotel across the street a few blocks done. It's pretty easy to find since the name of the hotel is on top of the building so you can see it from far away. The lobby is on the 15th floor so once we got up there we were greeted and got our room key, we were there around 5pm. The room was a pretty good size and had a shower/tub, toilet with controls, and stuff in the bathroom in case you forgot something like your toothbrush. Overall the price is great, the hotel is nice, and the convenience is great. I'd highly recommend taking the Narita Express to and from the airport, especially if you have JR East Rail passes. It's so convenient and the trains are super fast, comfortable, and clean. There are even monitors that show you flight updates and info on the terminal in English.Only complaint I'd have is check out is fairly early - at 11. We were 10 minutes late and they were calling us about it...","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Athena732</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",70,5.0

It is double the price of places like the Toyoko Inn chain and it is up to you as to whether it is worth the money. Location: Easy walking distance of Tokyo JR station (turn left out of the Yaesu North Exit and it is a short way on the other side of the road near a Family Mart) and B5 (and other exits) from Otemachi subway station. The lobby is on the 15th floor and the rooms below that. It was easy to walk to Ginza and the Imperial Palace from the hotel. Overall: great style and good quality of decor throughout - it feels like someone actually thought about this design as a simple modern hotel. The security seems to have been thought out somewhat as you need to place your key card against the panel to access any floor except the lobby / restaurant.Check In: efficient and in reasonable English although they seemed phased by the fact my friend was arriving later. They would not issue two keys until he had presented himself at reception. The room was not ready at the check in time of 2pm and they were very apologetic but it was by 2:10 - so who is to complain.Room: small but bigger than Tokyo budget standard - window was facing another building about 10 feet away but again usual for this class of hotel. Modern, clean room and well furnished. Outstanding points (for me): a Nespresso machine in the room with 8 capsules to use for 2 people and a great, powerful shower. Downside: no bath (my partner is Japanese and loves to have that). Weird: the bed. They talk about this sleep system. You push in your wake up time and then press start - soft music plays and the bed vibrates in time to the music. You don't have to do this but what the heck - I gave it a go. The wake up is the lights coming on gently with bird song playing. Restaurant: don't know because at 2,500 yen for a buffet I didn't pay for it. There is a chain coffee shop near the front door that does a set breakfast for 450 yen. Nice for a kind of half romantic stay just before Christmas - not sure I would pay the money for this to stay alone.","Saitama, Japan","StewieTokyo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saitama, Japan</strong>",198,4.0

The 24-hour Family Mart next door is also very convenient for self-catering of breakfast and purchasing snacks and drinks. The Keisei bus stop right outside the Family Mart makes airport transfers from Narita very easy. Location is perfect. Hotel staff speak good English, and very helpful.

Japanese style bidet toilet was a great addition, however it was a bit freaky as the toilet would get 'excited' (start powering up) whenever someone walked past it or walked into the bathroom. Free WiFi was a major plus. The bed was reasonably comfy, but the pillows were a bit annoying - whoever decided wheat was a good addition to a pillow obviously doesn't know what comfort is.

A bit of background about us as travelers and reviewers 1) We were suppose to head to Paris2) We were not very into Japanese Culture, and have no clue of the language or the writing3) But because we are young parents, and did not want to leave the kids for far too long and yet still want to enjoy a bit of lonely times and cool weather, and love autumn season - Voila, Japan it was for us.4) 1st ever trip to Japan for both of us Firstly, most of the things that other reviewers have mentioned were absolutely true. In general, there is almost nothing bad that I would even thought of worth mentioning, but of course, I need to let you know the uniqueness of this boutique hotel.Now points worth mentioning. a) The front desk executives spoke English and were very very helpful. We were welcomed warmly from them, and they have helped us hold our baggage before the check-in time. This gave us a bit of time (2 - 3 hours) to walk around Tokyo, We went to the gardens in the Imperial Palace which was 20 minutes away from the hotel, towards the West. b) The buttons in the toilets AND the room were very interesting. The funniest thing about this hotel (and perhaps other hotels in Japan - am not sure due to my limited knowledge of the city and country) was that the seat covers of the toilets are heated and warmed up. It lifted up within 1 second quietly attesting to Japanese technology. Just look at their hybrid cars (Toyoto/ Honda) - absolutely silent running engines. So the covers were not exactly comfortable initially, because we do not have them in Malaysia, but after a while of adjustment, it was very nice. should not talk about the rest of the buttons! (Laugh). In room 1417, the buttons on the control panel not only let out very soothing classical music from the bottom of the bed, but also let out a gentle vibration that stimulated comfortable sleeping. Yes, it was mentioned in the room menu and I kind of believe that, now. c) Value for money, especially when I monitored the prices for about 2 months prior to departure. I paid about USD200/night. It was a stop over for us. d) It's about 5 minutes walk to the Tokyo Station (East Side) where we boarded the Shinkanzen (Bullet Train) to other cities in Japan. Absolutely convenient and we did not even need the cab. The pathway to the train station was properly done up. I do not think my lugged luggage bags would complain. We also walked southerly and arrived at Ginza shopping district. e) When we arrived from Narita Airport via NEX, we accidentally came out from the Train Station (West Side) and because we are literally illiterate, we took a longer route round the station, to the hotel. That in itself took about 15 minutes walk. We walked towards the North from the red bricked building, turn right under the rail bridges towards the East. We kept walking, past 2-3 traffic lights, saw Shangri-La and Tokyo Station (scratched my head again) on the RHS and finally we arrived at the hotel safe and sound, next to a trunk road. If there's anything ill about our trip, it would be this and even so, I wouldn't consider this as anything bad as well.f) Very CLEAN and truly a NON-SMOKING room. That's a huge plus point for us, as we felt that a lot of Japanese smokes, especially in their restaurants. Another plus point which we really appreciated, was that the room had an air purifier. g) Nearby eateries both Japanese and Western styled, and 3 minutes towards the south of this hotel, there is a shoe shop with decent boots for sale. Excellent service there too! So in summary, I would recommend this hotel to anybody anytime. It's no fuss, simple, easy and probably the most centrally located (without paying through your nose) in Tokyo! Once we were near the Train Station, the whole of Japan was literally within our reach. Trust me, this is coming from somebody who did not like Japanese culture before - and we are truly converted.

I was told to look out for a beige building but the exterior of the hotel isn't really beige. Just look out for the hotel sign at the top of the building. As we reached the hotel around 7 am, we couldn't check-in yet but the staff were willing to keep our bags for us. We went back again at 12:30 pm, hoping that our room would be ready given that check-out time was 11 am and the housekeepers would have had some time to clean the rooms. But we were told that we had to wait for another hour. I felt that this was rather inflexible, especially since we saw our bags being transported to our room before the hour was up. It would have been nice if our room had given priority in terms of preparation since we had reached the hotel in the early hours of the morning and had been wandering around for sometime with no rest.Aside from this initial hiccup, the rest of our stay was comfortable. The staff didn't have a good grasp of English, including the restaurant staff. But one of them was helpful enough to come to our room to personally show us how to access the English TV channels. He was also kind enough to check the TV schedules for us on the Japanese channels to see whether there were any sports programmes showing. Unfortunately, we didn't get his name but he was on duty at the front desk at 1:30 pm on 2 Oct :) It would be nice if the hotel expands the number of English TV channels as I saw quite a few non-Japanese guests staying there. We stayed in the Forus room so there was no view. It was a bit disconcerting at first to look out and see the wall of another building but we got used to the lack of view. The shower stall (no bath tub) was awesome and was a key reason for me picking the Forus room. The comfort sleep system was over-rated - I didn't see how it would help to lull me to sleep. The items provided to us (e.g. bedroom slippers) were of good quality. The hotel was close to Tokyo Station and another subway station (name of which I cannot remember now) so in terms of travelling around and from Tokyo, it was convenient. There were also eateries, Starbucks and Takashimaya nearby so we felt relatively safe walking back at night.

Before commenting on the hotel, I have to add that I lived in Japan for many years, I speak the language and know a lot about the country (I went to college and worked in Japan), and now I came back to this country after an absence of almost 3 years. Now, back to the hotel, I have to say my expectations were not high, but not low either, having read the comments of previous users, and basically what I wanted from this hotel was decent service and a roof above my head while travelling around Tokyo with a friend (I booked 2 identical rooms, single). Trying to be as objective as I can, I did not enjoy the experience of staying at this hotel for the following reasons: 1)The room was simply too small; while I knew this beforehand, I found the price too high given the very very small space. In other words, the room may have been acceptable but only for a lower price given its size. Also, or even worse, the room faced a brown or beige building so it felt like a prison, really. If I tried a bit harder I may have been able to touch the wall of the opposite building. As I said, I stayed for 9 days at Ryumeikan, but this period was broken into two periods (2 and 7 days), having travelled in Japan in between. After the first 2 days, I asked the staff to get me a normal room with some view, ready when I get back for the second stay. But upon checking in again, I had the same problem and I complained…it was really hard to make them yield, I was told umpteen times it was not possible, but in the end I got very angry and told them that I can get a similar room facing a wall in a cheap business hotel like Toyoko Inn, but it would not cost me 200 dollars but 50 dollars. At last, after 10 minutes of negotiations and anxiety, the front desk lady told me she would call me back in 10 minutes (probably she went to escalate the issue to the higher manager) and in the end I got a room with a view on the 13th floor (this one was on the 8th floor). So in the end, it WAS possible to get a better room, despite all the talk that it was impossible.2)They asked for full payment in advance. When I checked in I had the option to pay by credit card or by cash; usually the hotels in Japan ask for your credit card and take a copy upon checking in, using it only if you disappear, but otherwise they wait until check-out and then they ask you if you want to settle by CC or in cash; at Ryumeikan, it was all upfront payment; 3)I included breakfast in my room package, and so I ate every day at the buffet restaurant on the 15th floor – the meal was identical every day, and by the 5th day I was getting tired of the choices available; also I found the price too high, basically 2500 JPY per person, I am sure the price of what I ate every morning did not surpass 800 JPY. Furthermore, on the last day I had to leave at 7 AM, so could not have the breakfast there (buffet opens at 7 AM), so I asked for a refund (why waste 50 bucks?) but they told me “impossible”; however, they stamped by breakfast tickets to be able to use them “next time”…I found this rather insulting and idiotic. Who knows when I will come back next time and what makes them so sure I will use their hotel? Apart from these points, the hotel was clean and very close to the station. The shower had good pressure, the toilet very clean and all necessary amenities available. The staff were very polite, but then again this is how they are everywhere in Japan, there was nothing special about Ryumeikan in this sense.All in all, I would not recommend this hotel for more than 1-2 nights. I think it should be good for people who want to be out all day and have a place to sleep at the end of a long day. I paid almost 20,000 JPY per night, but I would say the fair value of the room is closer to 10,000 JPY. But then again, prices are generally very high in Japan, so I had the option between a cheap and depressing business hotel of about 5000 JPY, Ryumeikan, or hotels like Hyatt or Shangri-La that cost at least 400 dollars per night. Given the choices available, Rymeiukan then is “relatively” cheap.","Bucharest, Romania","Stefan L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bucharest, Romania</strong>",43,3.0

We were certainly not disappointed from the moment we stepped into the lobby on the top floor to when we got to our room and was greeted with the much anticipated Nespresso machine ;)This being smack in the middle of the business districy of Marunouchi and Yaesu, the lobby on the top floor had impressive views overlooking the urban surroundings. Very nice touches in the various teas that guests could imbibe while waiting for check-in or out, both of which were hassle-free and quick.We were a bit worried that the Forus Semi-Double that we booked from Agoda at USD190, would be a really tight squeeze but it was actually okay. So we bumped shoulders a bit but the little things that make a hotel memorable more than made up for the squeeze. Firstly, the Nespresso machine with the 9 capsules beckoned and if you are a coffee addict, the smell of brewing coffee in the room would surely make your day. So I figured out what the whole ""designed for comfort sleep"" meant when I fiddled around with the various controls on my side of the semi-double bed. Ambient, dimmed lighting, soothing spa music and gentle vibrations at your feet will get you into sleep mode fast, unless you drank all of the 9 Nespresso capsules. Other thoughtful touches included 2 sets of yukata (Japanese robes), fluffy slippers and toe spongies for the ladies who need to touch up their nail polish. The bathroom came with rainforest shower and massage jets and there was even a swivel stool to sit on in case you got tired of standing! No view, but really I don't think you need it as you will be more engrossed with the sleep modules after the hot shower. Would definitely come back here again if I had to stay around Tokyo Station. Just to point out though that from Tokyo Station, make sure you find the Yaesu North Exit.

It is huge and it took a while to find the Yaesu north exit however once found and onto the street it was easy to find the hotel about 200 metres to the left on the other side of the road.The hotel is very classy with a clean feel about it. The reception staff were very friendly and had a reasonable grasp of English. The room we had was small and although I booked a double room the bed was up against the wall on one side. When I queried this they said it was a double room. only staying one night I wasn't about to argue but climbing down the bed in the middle of the night is not something I would expect of a double room. Everything although small was classy, the fittings, the toiletries, and the snacks and water provided.The bathroom was exceptional as was the toilet. What is it about the Japanese and toilets?It seemed to have a mind of its own and came to attention as soon as you got near to it.The immediate area is dominated by the massive railway shopping centre with lots of eateries and shops. Further up the road under the large corporate buildings there are restaurants and more shops. The other side of the railway station is the Imperial Palace. There is a walkway through without having to buy a train ticket.Something to be aware of if visiting Tokyo for the first time, navigation can be a challenge with street names being in Japanese and communication without Japanese language skills can be difficult. As always you tend to muddle though and get to where you need to go one way or the other.","Melbourne, Australia","WineloverMelbourne</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",140,4.0

The location was fantastic, two minute walk to Tokyo station. Not the best area for if you like going out partying at night though. We stayed at the beginning of our Japan holiday for five nights and hadn’t booked anywhere to stay for when we returned to Tokyo after traveling throughout Japan but after the first two nights here I knew we had to come back! We stayed in a Forus room. The room had an extensive range of toiletries including Shiseido moisturisers and a Nespresso machine with four different flavoured coffees. Also included was four bottles of water, packets of chips and flavoured teas. All of these items were replenished daily. The room itself was small. The bed was fantastic (on the small side though), the bed had a music, lighting and vibration function to put you to sleep at night. You could also plug your ipod into the bed and play your music through the speakers. The toilet possessed every function imaginable – a sensor for automatic flushing, bidet, dryer, seat heater. None of it was in English though so it was through trial and error to discover which button did what. The hotel had only one English TV station – BBC (I think) and free Wi-fi. Didn’t eat at the hotel restaurant so can’t comment on that but ate and had drinks at pub downstairs (The London Rose?) and it was honestly the WORST food I had in Japan so I wouldn’t recommend going there. We booked the first time 40 days in advance and received 40% off the room rate. The second time I booked over 10 day in advance and received 20% off the room rate. This was the only hotel I stayed in Japan I found that actually charged my credit card before my stay (which is usual practice for hotels in Australia). Staff were friendly and helpful. Just a note the hotel has laundries on the smoking floors and this is where the alcohol vending machines are. The non-smoking floors have only soft drink vending machines.

However the room had some significant drawbacks which after significant investment were a disappointment. Firstly the bed which as a small 4'6"" double was woefully small as a king or even a queen would have been appropriate for a room costing over £150 a night. Secondly the television offered 4 channels of european tv including BBC World. Sadly when we tried it was offering a pre defined audio track of jazz and no explanation of the lack of other language channels which if working would have made the world of difference for non japanese speakers.The lighting and audio system were billed as a new way of experiencing sleep and relaxation. Connecting my iphone to the system would only produce audible sound at maximum volume and this was poor quality and distorted. The lighting which I'd hoped would be all LED was a mixture of this and CFL low energy bulbs incapable of dimming or providing the relaxing evening atmosphere promised.The highlight (bemusingly the expensive item) is the toilet which auto flushes and produces every trick from a sliver remote control. Some english language help would avoid embarrasing flushes and water works. Overall the bathroom was good however a cheap shower wall material still makes it feel like a pre built installed system. Some tiles or real stone would make a world of difference here.So apart from location we wouldn't recommend this hotel.

Look across the street on the right and look UP (the name is on the top of the hotel tower). The price we paid was reasonable, and the room was average for Japanese size (i.e. small) and comfortable. There is a gorgeous lobby on the 15th floor. Staff was very friendly and spoke English for the most part. A 24 hour famliy mart is right next door (what a bonus!). There is no ATM nearby that takes US atm cards. The closest is at Citibank around the corner. You can ask the staff on how to get there and they will be happy to assist. Overall this is a great choice and I would recommend it.","New York City, New York","NikG76</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",51,4.0

I wanted to stay near Tokyo Station because we are taking the Shinkansen( bullet train ) to Kyoto and Osaka. This hotel is the best choice available for us. I highly recommend this hotel.I booked our stay via the hotel's website, and they offered 40% off if booked 40 days prior (although it is best to book earlier since the room choices decrease pretty quickly). Prepaid by credit card upon booking. Chose the standard single(1 bed about 140cm good for 2 persons) rather than the Junior suite since it came out cheaper. The rooms are on the smaller side( Japanese rooms are built to make use of all available space, and smaller than Western type hotel rooms), but space is still ample, not cramped.I emailed the hotel regarding nonsmoking rooms( make sure to choose the Nonsmoking designated rooms rather than just request for it), as well as having my daughter ( who is arriving ahead of us from Haneda airport) check in ahead of us. Plus requested for adjoining rooms( they do not have interconnecting rooms). Note that the hotel's lobby is on the 15th floor. Everything went along smoothly, they checked my daughter in, got us 2 rooms next to each other with a good view of the surrounding are. Hassle free.They emailed instructions on how to reach the hotel from Narita airport. Best and most economical way is to take the Keisei bus(#31), cost is ¥900. The best part is the bus literally stops at the corner near the hotel( Limousine bus stops further awayand Narita Express ( NEX) requires transfer and stops at Tokyo Station Yaesu North exit which is about 3 minute's walk). Have to purchase the return bus ticket to Narita at least 2 days before departure( receptio at the hotel has the info, payment is at the Family Mart close to the hotel. Plus the Nihonbashi subway stop (T10 line) is right behind the hotel.Everyone we dealt with were so helpful. There is a nice lounge on the 15th floor, they have a seating area with complimentary tea. The rooms have bottled water( in the refrigerator) pajamas, slippers and bathrobes. The main purpose of our hotel room is for resting and sleeping after a whole day of touring and shopping. So we did not use or require any facilities like a swimming pool or a firness center.We checked out of the hotel to travel to Kyoto and the front desk kept our luggages free of charge until we go back for 1 night's stay. They also have postcards in the room and will mail the postcard free of charge.We are going back for 1 night and will be staying in their Forus room Discovery. We are looking forward to this. Staff members are very helpful, rates are really reasonable and great value for Tokyo. It is a very central place, so this hotel is in the best location for a lot places. The bathrooms and amenities and toiletries are so complete and plentiful.Alll in all, this is really the best hotel to stay at in Tokyo.","Saint Augustine Beach, Florida","galtraveller22011</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Augustine Beach, Florida</strong>",93,5.0

There is no closet and barely anywhere to walk around in the room as the bed and the wall desk/chair takes up pretty much the whole room. The bathroom is perfectly fine...not the smallest bathroom, but is fine. As usual, Tokyo hotels have excellent water pressure and they also have very firm beds, which we prefer. My husband loves their heated toilet seats and built-in bidet. We paid $197 USD a night and would have gladly paid more to get a larger room at this hotel at not a whole lot more money, but since it was a prepaid rate, we were stuck with it.

Right from the pleasantly scented entrance our whole experience was wonderful. We got a Forus Semi-Double C Create room. We booked it through Agoda because they allowed us to choose which semi-double room size to reserve. Do be aware that Agoda requires you to pay for your entire stay at the time you make your reservation. The single semi-double rooms are A, B, or C, with C being the largest. We could have reserved the room through Hotel Ryumeikan's website but I was worried about reserving a room without using a credit card, which apparently is common in Asia. Some other hotel reservation websites wouldn’t allow us to choose room size A, B, or C at Hotel Ryumeikan.The Forus single semi-double C was plenty big for two people and space to spread out luggage. The room was 26.9 square meters and non-smoking. The bed was 140 cm x 205 cm which was slightly smaller than an American queen size bed but it was fine for us. The bed was very firm, just be aware. The pillows had a combination of buckwheat hulls and a soft filling which are popular in Asia. They are nice for neck support and we found them to be comfortable. They also have regular pillows. The bed has automatically dimming/brightening lights, music, and vibrations at the foot of the bed to help you fall asleep and wake up, which was very nice. Our room had a Japanese toilet with a heated seat, automatic nightlight, and automatic flush. There was plenty of counter space in the bathroom. The bathroom also had a hairdryer. The shower was a shower stall style (no tub) and was very nice, very strong spray, also with a rain shower head. The room was very clean, and feels newly renovated. The room also had a closet and wifi in the room, as well as a desk and small couch. The window only looked at the building next door but the room was so nice we didn't mind, and we just left the curtain closed. I recommend printing directions to the hotel - after a long flight, you don't want to be searching for the hotel while carrying luggage. From Tokyo Station, take the Yaesu North exit (follow the signs for Yaesu Central), exit by Daimaru department store, then cross the street, go left for 2.5 blocks, and the hotel will be on the right. Print a street view if desired.The hotel is also a short walk to Nihombashi train station for accessing trains that don't go through Tokyo Station. It was easy to get to Tokyo Station for using the subway and it was also nice to be able to get on the Shinkansen for day trips without having to transfer to another train station. Tokyo Station has plenty of restaurants to eat at. If you are looking for some nicer restaurants nearby, I recommend the Shin-Marunouchi building (the one closest to the Imperial Palace south corner - there are several Marunouchi buildings). There are several nice restaurants on the fourth and fifth floors as well as shops. We had a very nice dinner at a French restaurant there. There is an awesome French bakery Maison Kayser just a five minute walk away. Be aware they don't open until 10 am.  The hotel was quick to respond to emails before our trip, and they were very helpful. They put a lot of nice personal touches into the hotel and room. We liked Hotel Ryumeikan much better than the Hotel Granvia at Kyoto Station which was nice but was a very large hotel and felt very impersonal. We thought it was fine to stay near Tokyo Station even though it is a little less of a tourist area and more business. Most days we just hopped on the subway since Tokyo is so big. It is really helpful to be close to a train station. Tokyo Station is very large, so plan for extra time to find your train and platform. On our last day we were running through the station with our luggage to find the platform for the Narita Express to make our train in time. We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Ryumeikan and would definitely stay there again.

Hopefully, this review would help others make an informed decision :)Ryumeikan is the best Tokyo hotel we have stayed so far over 2 Japan trips. It is not the most expensive (Prince Park Tower was twice the room rate), but it gave us the best experience, by far.A bit of background: we stayed at Ryumeikan on the final day of our 2-week Japan trip. It was our ""chill and relax"" stop before the flight home the next day. We have always treated Japanese hotels as rooms to sleep in at night, rather than rooms where we can enjoy ourselves during the day. Ryumeikan so totally changed that perception.Pros:- Modern, boutique hotel décor consistently applied in rooms and common areas.- Lounge at the top floor has a nice view of the area with complimentary tea to enjoy.- FORUS system. It is one of those new-fangled room environment control system that integrates lighting, music, vibrating bed...(you get the idea :) It is definitely worth a try!- In-room Nespresso coffee machine. For coffee lovers like us, this is a godsend. Miles better than those you get in Lawsons and vending machines.- Room is new, cosy and extremely comfortable. Designer is a genius who balanced functionality and form perfectly. We want to stay in there all day!- High-end Toto Neorest toilet. Using it is a joy in itself.- Location: within short walking distance from Tokyo station. Get out at Yaesu North exit, cross the big street in front of you and turn left. Look out for the Keisei bus stop (there will be queues) and the Victorian Pub.- Keisei bus. This must be the cheapest way in and out of Narita. Forget NEX and other options. For 900 yen per trip, this saves you a lot of yen and best of all, Ryumeikan is right behind the bus stop. No more worries about lugging heavy bags up train escalators.Cons:- Our room had no view and stared right into a wall. Does not take away from the experience though ‘cos we just went up to the wonderful lounge at the top floor when we want to get a view.Tips: This is really a nice ""stopover"" hotel. You can do all your shopping in Daimaru, all 7-storeys of it, just across the street.Do have a meal at the Victorian Pub. We ordered the beef steak. Never ate so much meat in Japan :)Stay more than a night here.

They also give you a free bottle of water everyday, which I found to be a very nice touch. Laundry machines are located on certain floors, which is a lifesaver if you're traveling light. Oh and the showers in the Forus rooms are amazing! Incredible water pressure and massage options.The service at the front desk was impeccable too, and they even gave me a nice pocket map of Tokyo's subway lines with useful Japanese phrases (with English translations of course) on the back. Very polite and friendly, and they helped me with various things like sending luggage to another hotel via Ta-Q-Bin). Location wise, it's located in the middle of a business district I think, but there's a lot of restaurants around so finding food shouldn't be a problem. It will be busy though, since a lot of salarymen will be hitting up those food places. A Family Mart is also located right next to the hotel, which I frequented a lot. It's about a 5 minute walk to Yaesu North entrance of Tokyo Station, but be warned that it'll take a bit longer to reach the actual train you want to get on. Tokyo Station is absolutely massive and shouldn't be underestimated. Akihabara is also really close by if that interests you (2 stops).Flawless experience in my book. Also, free Wifi! For some reason, all the other hotels I visited had free internet in the form of a Ethernet jack. Hotel Ryumeikan was the only one that had actual Wifi in the room. I'll definitely visit again on my next trip to Japan.","Vienna, Virginia","lowzip</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vienna, Virginia</strong>",18,5.0

Location is AWESOME right across the rd from Tokyo Station and very easy to find. It's also close to Nihombashi metro which is convenient for several sights such as Asakusa and Ueno. There are lots of restaurants & bars in the surrounding streets and busy nightlife especially Friday night. The first room we had was huge, the second room for 1 night at the end was small but still comfy. Beds are very hard which we loved, this hotel gave us the best nights sleep of the trip.

Our room was a above average size which was excellent value for central Tokyo.Service was great, and is often the case it is the little things such as being given a hot face towel when we arrived at midnight coming in from 5'c night after a 12 hrs of flying. Nice introduction. The front desk staff spoke decent English which is good for those of us whose Japanese is a little bit lacking.It may well be normally at other Japanese hotels, but I liked the bathroom which has a Japanese touch to it such as bathing stool and bucket(you can still have a normal stand up shower if desire) and a deeper than the normal bath which was nice to relax in after a long day of walking. The hotel also supplies a good selection of toiletries which I haven't seen much of at other hotels such as hair gel, face masks, various skin and ageing creams! All very welcome.As is normal at most hotels in Japan, you get free WiFi and the speed was pretty decent.We had a buffet breakfast on the first morning and it was very much a Japanese style breakfast which i quite liked. Nice and refreshing food rather than the normal pastries and fried food. Though if you dont want to spend the money on a buffet breakfast each day(which is relatively expensive), the Excelsior Caffe next door does a cheap sandwich set breakfast meal which was pretty good.Hotel is about 3-5 minutes from the Yaesu North exit of Tokyo station, though realistically it is about 10 mins to get to an actual platform by the time you navigate through the station. Though, a better bet if you are planning on using the metro, is to go straight to Nihonbashi metro station only about 2 minutes from the hotel in the opposite direction which we found a lot more convenient.Having stayed in Shinjuku when last in Tokyo, this area of Tokyo is a bit more orderly and quiet. Having said that, it is still Tokyo and still plenty of places open to go to eat and drink and Tokyo station is always buzzing.","Brisbane, Australia","Scott M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",6,5.0

Stayed 2 nights and this is my 5th time to Japan so I hope I am able to give a fair review. Let me quickly touch on the important factors for choosing hotel: 1. Location- is actually not 3mins walk from Yaesu North exit. Is about 5 to 8 mins with luggage. 15mins from your JR exit. Ensure you have a 4 wheel luggage unless you use a Taqbin (courier service). this is why I didn't rate this hotel location as 5*- you can use an airport bus but I would advise N'ex since it is covered with JR pass or Suica card which saves you close to 6300yen.- With location at Tokyo station (is a major interchange), it is great for travelers planning to visit Kyoto/Osaka/other places since is the first stop so you can get seats even on non-reserved trains during Golden Week like us! The Japanese train transfers are a challenge if you have a big luggage, trust me. You will have to walk from one end to the other unless you know the directions very well. This is the main reason why I choose to stay near Tokyo station. If you are just planning Tokyo, you can choose Shibuya or Shinjuku however they are not far from Tokyo station using the JR Yamanote line as well.- very near Daimaru/shopping using the same Yaesu North/Central exit or entrance. You can easily get food there or Excelsior Cafe which is just 20m away and FamilyMart, 10m away.Starbucks is also just round the corner. There are many eating places around the hotel since there are many working crowds2. Service-typical polite Japanese folks-provided maps whenever necessary but they do not have a proficient concierge who can advise properly especially when English is not spoken commonly but that's ok since we have been to Japan a few times-they do not help you to put your luggage in the room which I found it appalling for the price paid -SGD 340 per night! Then again is Japan...everything is expensive in Tokyo ESP. 3. Rooms- we picked a twin room with two standard beds. While it is small (approximately 28sqm), it is adequate for two with one big and small luggage.- bathrooms are also good in size with a separate vanity area- the beds and pillows are also right in firmness - the only complain I have is the lighting, too dim and no way toadjust it to be brighter- cleanliness is top notch!Others - hardly any views, we had a view of the Tokyo station area only- they provided a whole basket of vanity items like hairband, facial creams which I like since they are from Shiseido-4 bottles of complimentary water which is from Kurobe area - robes for sleep is provided as well- we can't comment on their breakfast since the rate was without as we reckon we might be better off hunting for food elsewhereWe may choose other hotels in our next trip since there is nothing too outstanding about this hotel but it is still good overall minus the price.

Staff is well equipped with English language as well.If you are going in the Sakura blooming season, you could even catch the blooming on the next street as well.There's no better hotel under my opinion in Tokyo that could match them in terms of money well spent, location and comfyness.","Singapore, Singapore","AlexWong</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",58,5.0

The hotel is super quiet and the location was great, right across from the Tokyo station.

The hotel is very conveniently located a five minute walk from Tokyo station.We chose the hotel for its ease of access to Tokyo station with its easy access to Narita on the Narita Express. The hotel is also just around the corner from Nihombashi metro station. In terms of location it was a very good choice, you can easily get to/from the airport, travel around Tokyo and then return to this little oasis of calm. There are plenty of restaurants near to the hotel, most of them either had English menus or plastic food, so it is relatively easy for non-Japanese speakers.The room was well equipped with an en suite bathroom containing a fantastic shower. We stayed in a Forus room, which is an interesting concept. The bed vibrates in time with music to send you to sleep and the lights slowly brighten to wake you in the morning. It is certainly a novel experience.The reception staff were very helpful, we asked lots of questions about places we would like to see and they were happy to tell us how to get there. They also gave us maps, an English guide to Tokyo and an English guide with basic Japanese phrases.Would we return? Yes.

My room was 815 and since it faced another building's wall really had no view but that helped make it darker and easier to sleep for me. The Forus room category also feature a programmable sleep aid system that plays soothing music and gently vibrates the foot of the double bed and brings down the lights and does the reverse at the time you want to awaken that you set into the bedside control panel. I originally thought it a bit of a gimmick but it really is a pleasant way to drift off and awaken over some anonymous digital alarm clock beeping. The Discovery room also features a large shower stall, no tub, with five shower heads & nozzles you could adjust to your liking and it made for an invigorating start to the day that I grew to like. While not a large room as I was staying solo it was plenty big enough and offered plenty of well designed storage including drawers below the bed that I could put clothes and personal items away but still have them easily at each. The heated toilet seat and choice of toilet controls also sat well with me. Rounding out the room features was a nice Nespresso coffee maker, flat screen TV with a few channels in English (CNN & BBC), good soundproofing so you didn't hear your neighbors, individual heating & cooling plus and an in-room safe were also other room features that made this little room a comfortable place to unwind and get some restful sleep away from a hectic city while still being right in the middle of it.The staff is also as wonderfully helpful and hospitable accommodating my requests and answering my questions quickly and efficiently. The hotel is exceedingly well managed and run and you notice that in many ways from staff interaction to art postcards the hotel will post at their cost to bike rentals and Yubisashi city maps that are printed in both English & Japanese to ease your sightseeing should you get lost. In short, lots to like about this hotel and recommend to those wanting a central location at a decent price. I can't really find much to fault about the entire stay except that perhaps the terms & conditions of the 30% off promotion could be a little clearer when booked online as while I couldn't find it written anywhere despite having to fully prepay at time of booking to a credit card this rate is completely refundable up to 2 days prior to arrival as was confirmed to me by a staff member when I'd email asking about the fine print. That, however, is a very small detail compared to everything the Ryumeikan does and does very well and were I to return to Tokyo would definitely put this hotel at the top of my list of hotels as I'd love to return for longer than 3 nights.","Edmonton, Canada","tcook052</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",247,5.0

We booked a triple room (which was a twin with an extra bed) and we had plenty of space even with a cot in the room as well. Take care to book a triple for three people (apparently this is not assumed when paying extra for a triple). The woman that checked us in was quite surly, an anomaly in Japan I found, but the rest of the staff were outstanding. I left something at our previous hotel that they organised to get to me overnight at a very reasonable price, and one staff member even walked with my 4 year old son to the post box at 9pm (it was outside the hotel and down the street a little) as he didn't understand that they would send his postcards for him- so lovely. The hotel is in a great location, a few blocks from the mammoth Tokyo station, which has food options that would take a year to sample. It is walking distance from the shopping district of Ginza and there is an airport bus for Narita outside and one for Haneda down the road. There is also a convenience store next door. There is a laundry room in the hotel which is a godsend when travelling with little children!I highly recommend this hotel if it is in your budget. It has a lovely feel to it, the rooms are really nice and the toiletries were excellent - my aching body appreciated the bath soaks each night after walking all day!

They also included origami paper and a free postcard which they mail and pay the postage for. It's the little touches like that that make this hotel awesome. The only downside (and this isn't even really a big deal) is that the cheapest room might be a bit cramped for two people. I was on my own, so it was perfect. I was expecting small, so it was fine. As a side note, I planned the trip with a friend who because of scheduling had to book a hotel later. He booked one right down the street and roughly the same amount that I paid per night, but when I went to visit him, I was shocked at how much nicer my room was than his.

To be honest, we were a bit anxious before we arrived about how the hotel will be. But the moment we stepped off the taxi, we were absolutely in love with the place. Here's why.The property is in pristine shape. It's not a typical hotel where you walk into the lobby on the ground floor and there are tourists and staff falling over each other. Rather, the entrance is more like an apartment, with only a lift lobby. For the reception, you'd have to go to the 15th floor. We loved this, as we felt like we were staying in a serviced apartment, rather than a hotel. We stayed at a Forus C room. Our room, although slightly smaller than average, was very well designed. There was great utilization of space, plenty of amenities in the bathroom and main room (including Nespresso machine). The bathroom was immaculate, with a separate shower booth (great force on the shower) and the legendary ToTo automatic toilet. The only drawback of the room was no view, and very little storing space (two compartments under the bed). For 2 people that's a bit tight, but it's very manageable. The room, otherwise, was very quiet with comfortable bed and pillows.The staff were extremely polite, as are the entire population of the great city of Tokyo. They were very eager to help out with any queries with excellent command of English. Thanks to wonderful(sarcasm) Air China, our baggage was delayed by a day and the staff were very cooperative during the process, coordinating with the airline whenever they could. The best thing was that the hotel's staff was always there when you needed them, but never really in your face otherwise. The staff always makes the hotel. No wonder we had a great stay!Last but in no way the least, the location of this hotel is unbeatable. It is literally steps away from the Tokyo Central station, which is the main hub for all metro and commuter trains in and out of Tokyo, including the Shinkansen. But don't think this makes it a crowded area, you won't even feel like you're staying next to a central station. The hotel is also walking distance from the Imperial Palace, which is on the Marounochi side of the station, among other things. Daimaru, which is right opposite the hotel is the legendary Japanese department store. The neighborhood has plenty of sushi bars, ramen places as well as a Starbucks. You couldn't find a better location for a hotel.7 days wasn't enough for a first-time trip to Tokyo. We're definitely coming back and when we do, we won't even bother looking for any other hotel.

CONVENIENT LOCATION. Really enjoyed our experience - we only booked 1 night here because it is near Tokyo Station which we were departing from the next day for a Kyoto trip. Wished we would've stayed longer.FRIENDLY STAFF. We asked the reception to keep our bags for the few days that we were away so that we could pick it up when we return. Great service, friendly English-speaking staff.AWESOME ROOM. Our room had a rain shower thing and even a spot to sit. Very nice. Love the bed with the music and speaker to help us relax or even wake us up in the morning! Japanese rooms are tiny, this one is small also, but not overly so.SPECIAL TOUCHES. It was our honeymoon and they gave us a nice bottle of champagne. And bathrobes come as standards for most hotels in Japan I think, but Ryumeikan also provides us with a little booklet with Tokyo map, subway map and some Japanese lessons. Very helpful since that was the start of our journey.We will definitely return (to Tokyo and to this hotel.)",Melbourne,"littlemisslooksee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",29,5.0

You can get from here to pretty much anywhere with real ease.The hotel is a 5-10 minute walk from the Yaesu North entrance of Tokyo station. It's actually on the same road. Nihombashi subway station is around the corner, a 2-3 minute walk away.Otemachi subway may look close on the map, but it's a good 20 minute walk. It's handy if you have to use it, but plan to get by without it if you can.Even though the hotel is right in the city, next to the station. It's easily the quietest city hotel I've stayed in. The room doors are big heavy fire doors, but they soft close with literally no sound.We didn't hear any noise from the street, even though there was construction work going on on the other side of the road from the hotel. The windows are obviously very well sound proofed.Depending on which website you use to book, they describe the rooms differently which is a bit confusing. I was travelling with my wife and we booked a standard 'semi double' which on the Ryumeikan website is actually called a 'standard single'. Essentially this is a room with a normal double bed (for UK sizes) pushed against the wall. The room was very small, there's only just enough room to open a large suitcase on the floor. There's no wardrobe, the only hanging space is a hook on the wall for a couple of coats and a few shirts maximum.There's a fridge in the room that they stocked with bottles of water we used each day and were free of charge. There's a small convenience store right next to the hotel which is handy.The array of toiletries provided in the bathroom was actually quite impressive. In amongst the collection were a hairbrush, toothbrush, shower cap, hair band, bath salts, shaving gel and moisturiser.Little things that impressed me were the mirror in the bathroom was heated so it doesn't steam up. The shower gel and shampoo were topped up every day so they were always full. There were slippers and pyjamas provided. The toilet is a funky Japanese toilet with a heated seat and all the bidet features that appear to be standard in Japan. These are minor things, but I've paid a lot more for hotels in London and got nothing like the level of service this hotel provided.Another example, when we arrived they gave us warm towels and a pocket map of Tokyo.Additionally, we actually checked out of this hotel and back in again after staying in Kyoto for a few days. The hotel reception were more than happy to look after a case and bag of ours whilst we were away. This was free of charge and when we checked in the second time they'd already put our bags in our room. Another nice touch.Overall I fully recommend this hotel. The location is truly excellent for getting around Tokyo, combined with the high level of service, it makes it really great value for money.","Wokingham, United Kingdom","Timberford</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wokingham, United Kingdom</strong>",91,5.0

The bed was really firm which we prefer. Considering its location the room was also really quiet, even with construction work happening across the road. We couldn't hear any noises from outside or the neighbouring rooms. The bathroom facilities were comprehensive and really well kept with the typical Japanese toilet and a shower and bath. Air con and heating was easy to adjust. We didn't have breakfast included, but thought we would try the hotel breakfast on the first day. It's pretty much Japanese fare only, and even though we were prepared to be adventurous, we just couldn't handle that sort of food to start the day, so went to some local cafes for a more Western option for the rest of our time. The hotel is right next to the Nihombashi subway so it's very easy to access public transport. **TIP** If you get dropped off by the airport limousine bus all you need to do is head left as you step off the bus straight down the road a couple of blocks. If you've been walking for more than five mins you've probably gone past it. The hotel is on the same side of the street as the bus drop off. We were given a map at the airport that showed something entirely different, so we spent a fair bit of time wandering around trying to get our bearings.

The basic room that I booked through hotels.com with one double bed was very small with one place to put a suitcase and no closet. The window had a wide and long sill on which I put most of my folded clothes. Despite the lack of a closet and the compactness of the room, everything looked new, was immaculate, and felt very cosy. There was a small fridge, hairdryer, LCD TV (with only 2 English language channels -- CNN and BBC), and great ethernet and/or wifi connections at no cost. The outlets in the hotel fit standard 2-prong U.S. plugs (either the grounded kind or the old ones with 2 identical prongs). There is a decent desk with an office chair. The bathroom had a deep tub and an on-the-wall or hand-held shower with fabulous water pressure. The toilet had a heated seat and other nice options. The mirror over the sink had a defogger so that even when the room fogged up from a shower, a part of it was always clear. The amenities were abundant and nice -- robe, slippers (replenished when I took a pair to bring home), shoe brush, toothbrush, hairbrush, comb, razor, facial cleansers and moisturizers (no body lotion however), liquid shower soap, shampoo and conditioner. Despite its downtown location, the room was very quiet with the windows closed. My room (1105) was right over the A/C/heating system and so it was very noisy when I opened the windows -- imagine that this would be true for the same and neighboring rooms on the 10 - 14th floors. The hotel felt very safe as a key is required to get to the hotel floors (note that this is a business building with the hotel being on the upper floors). The reception is on the top floor (15) which is not immediately clear when you walk into the building. Walking in from the street, you need to turn left and go through another set of glass doors to the elevators and then go up to the 15th floor. There is a sign downstairs,but it's on an LED screen that rotates so that I saw nothing in English or indicating where the hotel was when I first walked in.The staff were okay, but the ones I interacted with did not have great English and I don't speak Japanese. The advice they gave me on getting to Narita airport was confusing with one staff member recommending one bus company (the one right next to the hotel) and another saying definitely not to use that bus as it was complicated and required buying a ticket from a specific convenience store (apparently not the one nearby). (I'm adding some transportation tips under Tokyo Central Station).As noted by others, the location of the hotel is very central. Tokyo is a town of distinct neighborhoods, and the Ryumeikan is in a very business-y area with Tokyo Station a block away. The area doesn't have a lot of character, but there are many restaurants nearby and the station has more restaurants as well as a department store, Daimaru, that has an expansive selection of prepared foods, including sushi, tempura, sweets, etc. on the lowest level. There is a ""Family Mart"" (convenience store) right next to the hotel and ""Excelsior Cafe"" is 2 doors down. Were I to return to Tokyo, I would certainly consider staying here again; the reason I might not would be because I would like to be in another area with more little shops.",US,"StarryNight01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>US</strong>",56,5.0

And with its close proximity to these transportation lines, you can bet there are an ample number of restaurants and shops nearby. But let me also mention the hotel's amenities. I thought the service and accommodations at the ANA Crowne Plaza Osaka were par excellence, so I wasn't expecting much when I arrived at Hotel Ruumeikan. But boy, was I wrong. The hotel is very quiet and ""boutique-y"" and has laundry facilities for its guests. The staff is very helpful and all speak amazing English. My room (single) is immaculate and although it doesn't have an official closet, the frills within it make up for the lack of storage space. There's an in-room espresso machine. There's an ample office area. There's a small refrigerator. They leave clean pajamas for me daily. Sound good? Wait, there's more! My room is a FORUS room. I wasn't sure what that meant when I booked the room, but let me tell you: it's heaven. When I want to go to sleep I turn my FORUS sound system on. It automatically turns down all the lights in my room and begins to lull me to sleep with relaxing music and vibrations at the foot of my bed. I've never figured out how long this plays because since my first night here I've fallen asleep within a few minutes. When I set the alarm clock the opposite happens... The lights in my room gradually begin to come on about ten minutes prior to my wake time. Ten minutes later the lights are fully on, music plays to awaken me sweetly, and soft vibrations beckon me to get up. I'm seriously wanting one of these systems in my house!Tonight is my fourth night at the Hotel Ryumeikan Tokyo and I've found everything to be consistently terrific.

When the preset wake up time is up, the music will be played again, and room lights will be on. You can also switch on the foot vibration. This sleeping experience is very unique and very useful when u need a good quality sleep.The room rate is a bit pricey but given a premium location it's totally worth all the penny.

The staff were very professional, and the rooms new and clean. There was no view from our room (a Double Semi-Forus), but it didn't really matter as we spent most of our time recovering from jet lag or out and about.

The one funny thing about the hotel is that the reception is located in the top floor, instead of ground floor. There's a restaurant (with quite a pricey brekkie), and a pub downstairs (that's apparently never open), but the sheer amount of restaurants around Tokyo Station makes it up. Rooms - well, clean, beautiful, and feng shui to the max; toilet is also very good (no bathtub, but who needs one anyway) with *amazing* shower. You don't get to see the staff of the hotel that often, since well they are located in the top floor instead of ground, so there's no reason to hike up there usually. But who wants to see them anyway? And then there's the speakers, which I absolutely love. Yeah, great set of almost-surround-like speakers embedded in the bed, providing very good quality sound for evening/morning music listening, which is usually the one thing that's relatively complicated in a hotel room.

It wasn’t as easy to find as we’d anticipated. Getting out of Tokyo Station to the Yaesu North Exit was a task in itself. Once going through the two parts of the Daimaru department store, we couldn’t easily see the building which is on the street directly out of the exit – look to the tops of the buildings for the hotel sign as in the pictures, to your left, on the opposite side of the street. Even the taxi driver parked in front of the station didn’t know where it was, including after seeing the address. There’s a diagonal crosswalk out of the Yaesu North exit – cross diagonally to 10 o’clock, and keeping walking past a couple of small streets/alleys, and the building will be almost at the end of the main street.Finding the building was the only challenging part – the rest was wonderful. Once inside the building, from reception where they gave us towels to freshen up, to the actual rooms, which were small but absolutely wonderful. They block out all the street noise, and are geared for a calming experience. The showers are exceptional – they have rainfall showerheads and massage showers, including a seat to sit on while the shower jets massage your back. The shower is built so that the steam also does flow out into the bathroom or the rest of the hotel room. The rooms are spotless. There are a large assortment of tea and coffee to choose from. They even provide mini fold up maps of the city and transport that include useful phrases in English and Japanese.This will be my new go to place each time I return to Tokyo – but the challenge may be the availability, as it wasn’t available the next time I tried.

This was a problem for us because we have a toddler that wants to eat toast and eggs for breakfast.","Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","Judy G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates</strong>",33,4.0

I printed off the directions the hotel gives on their website which probably could be improved ,looking for an ivory coloured building wasn’t much help at night , however if you use their instructions cross the road on the zebra crossing turn left and follow the road for around 800mtrs its one of the last buildings on the street. You will probably see the Rose & Crown bar before you see the hotel sign as this is right next door.We tried to book directly with the hotel however the website said that they had no rooms available so we booked a standard semi double room through Agoda. The room was small i.e. one person had to be on the beb to allow the other one to walk around , however on the plus side the bed was comfortable , the free toiletries the best we have ever used in a hotel and the rooms extremely quite. We didn’t hear any noise from the adjoining rooms or outside.Because it’s in the business district & its proximity to the station and Daimaru there were plenty of options when it came to eating that didn’t break the bank. Another major benefit was that it’s only a couple of minutes walk from the Nihonbashi Metro station, walking distance to Ginza and the Imperial palace.

With the JR rail pass you can use the Yamanote line that circles Tokyo. You must be observant to spot the hotel sign since it’s more of an office building with hotel rooms starting about mid-building and lobby / restaurant on the top floor. To reach the hotel, enter a small elevator lobby just inside the main building entrance. Hotel is maybe 2-3 blocks north of the station above ground, but after a while in the area you realize that you can almost reach the hotel underground in the maze of shops, restaurants, below street level around Tokyo station.Basic business-style rooms and no view unless you like looking at nearby office buildings. Single rooms are small with basic accommodation having no closet, but hangers on a hook for clothes. Below the hangers was a bench/single-drawer that had space for a small in-room safe. Nice touches are complimentary Tokyo mini-map (on the bed on check-in), daily bottled water, and room slippers. There’s also a “low-tech” foot massager for those long days of walking around Tokyo sightseeing. Room is equipped with a modular, compact bathroom with one of those technically-advanced Japanese toilets. The bathroom did have a strange feature – a large porthole window over the bed – maybe to watch TV (though the angle is difficult) since there's also a speaker system to hear the audio from inside the bathroom.

I decided on somewhere near Tokyo Station as I was going to be using the Narita Express to travel to and from Tokyo and also the Shinkansen for my trip across Japan.Hotel Ryumeikan had a very good rating and availability for the the beginning and end of my month's holiday and it completely lived up to that ranking.The hotel is just a couple of blocks and a few minutes walk from Tokyo Station so once you've worked out which exit to use (the hardest part) getting there is a breeze. There is also a subway station about five minutes walk away from which you can get to just about anywhere using Tokyo's superb transport system (when arriving at Narita airport buy a Narita Express + Suica card, the latter can then be used on all rail lines within Tokyo including subway and private lines).I was a little early for check-in so I left my bags at the hotel and went to explore. When I returned my bags had been delivered to my room.I had a semi-double room on the 12th floor with a nice view over downtown Tokyo. The hotel occupies the top section of an office block so all rooms will be on high floors. The reception is on the 15th floor.The bedroom was small (as many are in Japan) but with a double bed. The only possible drawback could be if you required storage space for clothes as there was none save for a few hangers. The bed was very comfy though and they provided a fresh yukata and bottled mineral water every day. There's also a fridge which is left empty and not filled with the usual overpriced booze.External noise levels were very low and I had some of the best nights sleeps of any hotel (although the sake may have helped!). Free Internet was available via a ethernet cable or fast WiFi. There were also Ice and vending machines on my floor and a coin-operated washing machine and dryer which was very useful as I never really saw a lot of laundromats. The bathroom had a full range of amenities which were replenished everyday. The toilet was a typical Japanese one with bidet,washing functions and a heated seat (a very nice way to start one's day). Everything was neatly arranged to the extent that all the nozzles on the soap dispensers were turned so that they all pointed in the same direction!)I never saw or heard the housekeeper but the room and bathrooms were kept spotlessly clean. There was a restaurant next to the reception on the 15th floor but as the hotel is located on the edge of the Ginza entertainement district there didn't seem much point in using it. There's also an English style pub by the ground floor entrance.At street level Tokyo can be quite difficult to navigate so I'd highly recommend getting a portable WiFi device (there are several companies you can rent one from who will deliver to your hotel) to use with your smartphone.Even more impressive than the hotel though were the staff who couldn't do enough to help me with any requests. They booked several restaurants for me and even let me know when the chef at one of them had moved to a different location. Well worth sending any special requests ahead of time to them.I'm already planning a return trip to Japan and the Ryumeikan will be top of my list for accommodation in Tokyo.","London, United Kingdom","HERMANOPRIMERO</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",16,5.0

It's very conveniently located near to Tokyo's main station, so for arrivals both by Shinkansen and the Narita Airport express service. Best exit for the hotel is Yaesu North, cross the road, then go left for about 100 yards. The reception is on the top floor which initially caused some confusion.We had a more basic room for our first stay, which was nevertheless comfortable, quite compact, but had everything we needed. Our second stay we went for the slightly nicer room with bathroom divided into shower/bath room, toilet (complete with automatically opening toilet lid and the usual inbuilt bidet) and basin room. The staff were always polite, friendly and helpful, example including helping us book Sumo tickets, and getting a cab for our red eye excursion to the fish market. They also remembered that it was my girlfriends birthday on our second visit and sent us up some complimentary bubbly...a lovely touch. Next to reception there is a small restaurant which does a nice buffet breakfast and evening meals. It's not the cheapest, but if you don't fancy going out it's decent.As another reviewer mentioned, if you want the livelier part of Tokyo, head to Shinjuku, this seems more of a business area, but it's close enough to Ginza (about ten minute walk) for more upmarket shopping and Chuo for the fish market. I would recommend staying here.","Rickmansworth, United Kingdom","boyvision</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rickmansworth, United Kingdom</strong>",97,5.0

It's quite affordable for this area and it feels like a luxury hotel. The location is very convenient - just two blocks from Tokyo Station where you can easily catch the Narita Express or Sobu Line to Narita airport. Tokyo Station is a huge transportation hub so you can pretty easily get anywhere in the city from here by subway or JR Train. There is a 24 hour convenience store right next door to the hotel. The area around this hotel is real swanky, which was fun to experience, at least for one afternoon.

It was very easy to find - just down the block from Tokyo Station at the Yaesu North exit. The very lovely reception area is on the 15th floor. There were several floors (including the ground floor) that were offices and the hotel rooms were in between. These are the things we really liked:- Stylish decor- 2 complimentary bottles of water each day- Nightwear, which we used as robes, came freshly pressed each day- Toilet with all the Japanese buttons (heated seat, sprays, deodorizer)- Big tub and shower with large pump bottles of shampoo and conditioner- English language newspaper (complimentary) in the reception area- Empty refrigerator for you to fill with snacks- Free in-room wifi- Having the train station, shops and dining halls right across the street- Walking distance to Ginza- The staff: although not everyone spoke English, they were all exceptionally friendly There were only a few things that could have made the place perfect. 1. We booked the least expensive rooms and they were tiny. There was virtually no storage - a few hangers and part of a drawer which shared the safe. We managed because we didn't unpack even through we were there for 4 nights. We considered upgrading, but the only rooms left were smoking rooms. They were considerably more expensive and much bigger. 2. On a Friday night, you need reservations to gain entry into most of the local restaurants.The housekeeping staff even folded our nephew's clothes which he left on the floor of the room.","Brighton, Michigan","baileyfirestone</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brighton, Michigan</strong>",89,5.0

Originally chosen due to its proximity to Tokyo station but after staying here we will definitely chose this hotel in the future. It is quite new and spotlessly clean. A different feature is the lobby is on the 15th floor and all of the rooms are below. Literally just a few steps from Tokyo station on the Yaesu side, north exit, it has everything nearby you need. From Daimaru department store and numerous restaurants in the station itself to a variety of restaurants and bars in the small streets nearby. The rooms are smallish but quite adequate even with several large suitcases - which we had. The hotel held these for us when we departed for a couple of days. The bathroom is wonderful. A great Toto washlet toilet and a large Japanese style soaker tub, both in seperate rooms. Free internet is included. Since Tokyo station is the center in Japan for most domestic travel it is a convenient spot. Buses run to Haneda or Narita frequently at the south Yaesu side and of course all of the trains to everywhere.

We stayed at this hotel on Jan 2 and 3, 2012. After finding our way out of Tokyo Station with a lot of help, the hotel was right across the street. Took the elevator to the 15th floor reception desk and we were greeted with warm wash cloths and hand warmers (and it really wasn't that cold). The desk people are the most helpful I've ever run across. When we left, the girl at the desk went down on the elevator with us, hailed a taxi and explained to the driver where we were going (the bus station to get a ride to the Haneda Airport). And there's no tipping so this wasn't an attempt to get money. These people are just genuinely nice! The room (described as a FORUS room) was fairly small but had an incredible array of amenities; every kind of toiletry item you can imagine. The amazing Toto toilet had a control panel that I never actually figured out, but touching the toilet was unnecessary. There were buttons to lift the lid, the lid and the seat and close everything. The seat auromatically heated when anyone was in the vicinity and a small light came on in the toilet if you approached it at night!! The bed had an alarm system that vibrated the bed, played soft music and slowly turned off the lights at night and did the reverse in the morning. No cheap old coffee pot. The room was equipped with a Nespresso machine and a separate container to heat water. Each day we got new slippers that were sealed (and quite nice) and instructed to take them with us. Fresh robes were laid out on the bed every day. When we went to the front desk to inquire about a city tour for the one full day we were in Tokyo, the entire front desk staff got involved and made reservations for us; then gave us detailed instructions on how to get to the pick up point. This is a place I would recommend without any hesitation; both for the accommodations and the extradorinarily helpful staff.","Blackshear, Georgia","rogo82</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Blackshear, Georgia</strong>",38,5.0

Selected the hotel based upon TripAdvisor reviews and wasn't disappointed. Although the hotel is in a business district and located on the top floors of an office building, it was a great base for this senior mom/adult daughter team to explore the city. HOTEL RESERVATIONS: The hotel offers a variety of discounts for booking online. I received a 30% discount for booking more than 30 days in advance. I booked approximately 120 days in advance. When I tried to book earlier than that the reservation system was not set up to accept the rate so I kept checking back every week or so. NOTE: The card you use to make the reservation is the card that will be charged upon check out. We wanted to use a different card (one with no foreign transaction fee) than the one used to make the reservation but found out (or at least were informed very politely) we could not switch cards because the hotel staff does not have access to the online payment system. Choose your card wisely before booking online!FROM NARITA TO THE HOTEL: We used the Airport Limousine (AL) coach bus service to Tokyo City Air Terminal (referred locally as ""T-CAT"") and then took a taxi to the hotel. This route was recommended by the hotel, as the walk from the closest AL bus stop was farther than my mom and I wanted to negotiate in the dark, after a long flight, with our luggage (mom also uses a cane). The one-way fare from Narita was 2900Y per person and our taxi fare was approximately 800Y. The ride from T-CAT to the hotel was relatively short because we arrived on a Sunday evening and there was no traffic. If you take a taxi from T-CAT when traffic is heavier the fare to the hotel will be more.CHECK IN: Reception is on the 15th floor and check in was fast and efficient, especially since all credit card information was already on file. The elevators have a security system; you will need use your room key to access your floor.THE ROOM: Guestrooms are on floors eight through 14. We booked a non-smoking standard twin (two beds) and were very pleased with the room size and location (12th floor, overlooking Sotobori Dori, the street in front of the hotel). Very impressed with the soundproofing -- it was one of the quietest rooms we've stayed in. The room aesthetic consists of clean lines and calming effects. There was plenty of space for the two of us to each have our own ""space."" We invited two of my mother's university colleagues who are in Japan on sabbatical to see the room and we were informed that it was only a little smaller than their two-room university apartment! In addition to the two beds (each were the equivalent of U.S. full size bed with a firm mattress, and two pillows, one of which was half-filled with buckwheat or something similar), the room had an armless easy chair and matching ottoman, a wardrobe for hanging clothes, a wall desk unit with good surface space, a comfortable desk chair, a humidifier (which we used after a staff member showed us how to turn it on) and plenty of lighting. The sink and vanity were separate from the shower/tub combo and Washlet toilet. The tub is shorter and deeper (by U.S. standards) and the water pressure and availability of hot water is exceptional. The pictures on the website are very accurate as to the room layout and furnishing.ROOM AMENITIES: Free wi-fi, two bottles of complimentary water every day. Small fridge in the desk unit (not a mini bar) and an electric kettle for tea (which is provided). If you want in-room coffee you'll need to bring your own instant, like Starbucks Via.Very nice green tea shampoo conditioner, and bath gel in large pump containers. They were always full, so we suspect the housekeeping staff refilled them every day. There are two drawers underneath the vanity filled with every toiletry and personal care item you could imagine. Be careful about using the moisturizers - they are very runny. When I opened a package the liquid squirted out of the package, ran off my hand, and onto my t-shirt. In addition to slippers, the hotel also provided each of us with a sleeping garment: a white waffle weave, robe-like garment with front buttons.They were replaced fresh every day. HOTEL SERVICE: We experienced excellent customer service, from my email inquiries about transportation from Narita to our day of departure, when a reception staff member escorted us downstairs to the front of the hotel, went around the corner during a rain storm to hail a taxi, and stood over us with two umbrellas as we put our luggage and ourselves into the car. During the week I had transportation questions about using the train to get to destinations outside the Tokyo. I was provided with a detailed train map in English and Japanese and directions for correct train to take. The reception staff patiently wrote out a half dozen phrases in Japanese that we could show a taxi driver once we reached our destination. While our questions and requests were answered in English with varying degrees of fluency it was always with a uniformly high level of courtesy and willingness to help. We never saw the housekeeping staff but our room was always serviced by the time we returned (housekeeping service begins at 10:00 a.m.) and they kept our room meticulously clean and well supplied with water, towels, sleeping garments, and toiletries. LOCATION: Perfect for our purposes. Easy access to the train (the north entrance of Tokyo Station is a three-minute walk; Tokyo Station is also a good place for a meal, as there are a number of restaurants throughout the station - try DomPierre in Kitchen Street for Asian-style curry). Very close access to the subway (Nihonbashi Station, entrance/exit A3, is a one-minute walk around the corner on Eitai Dori). Coffee and light American-style breakfast items are available at Tully's (on Sotobori Dori, across the street from the hotel entrance, next to the post office), Excelsior Caffe (exit the hotel, turn left, just past the Family Mart, a 24-hour convenience store), and Starbucks (exit the hotel, turn left, walk a couple blocks, turn left at the golf store on the corner and it's down half a U.S. block and across the street). Department stores within a five-minute walk: Takishimaya, Mitsukoshi, and Daimaru (don't forget to check out the department store restaurants for sit-down meals and food halls on the basement levels for takeaway). Other places to visit (distance from the hotel is noted in minutes) include the Nihombashi Bridge (Tokyo history and Japan geography - five minutes); Kite Museum (a small space crammed with a fraction of a fantastical collection of Chinese and Japanese kites - five minutes); and the Bridgestone Museum of Art (built during the post-war period, it houses a modest but charming collection of French and Japanese Impressionists, with a smattering of sculptures, including some ancient Greek and Egyptian pieces - seven to ten minutes).The Imperial Palace Gardens are nearby (northwest of Tokyo Station) and the Crafts Gallery (west of the Gardens).After exploring Tokyo and making discoveries, either locally or farther afield, we always looked forward to returning to our room for what we knew would be a relaxing and restful night's sleep.","Portland, Oregon","LucieBlue</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",106,5.0

This is very convenient if you are taking the N’EX (Narita Express) or the Airport Limousine buss from the airport. You won’t have to take a taxi or subway to reach the hotel since the hotel is just across the station. In addition if you need to take the Shinkansen you are also just across Tokyo Station. The hotel is also right around the corner (literally and figuratively) from a Nihonbashi station exit/entrance.Once in the building you need to take the elevator to the 15th floor where the lobby (and check-in) is. There is nobody to welcome you or help you with your luggage on the ground floor though, not a problem since the elevators are right beside the entrance of the hotel.Check-in was quick and the staff always polite (you’re in Japan after all). I was informed/reminded of my restaurant reservations as well.My room , a Forus B (Success) room, was small (any room in Tokyo will be small) but it’s wasn’t cramped at all. The layout was very efficient even though there was a double bed, desk, and couch in the room. The room looked new and is quite modern.I was actually surprised about the free amenities in the room: slippers, internet, Nespresso machine, bottled water, toothbrush, razor, and lots of other toiletries. I wish chain hotels would offer these amenities as standard as well (yeah, I think I will have to keep on dreaming though)… The bathroom does not have a tub (expected for such a small room) but came with a shower booth that had a big rain showerhead. Fantastic was to start or end your day (water pressure was great btw)! The toilet was a Toto washlet (a super fancy toilet) that had an electric lid and (heated) seat, automatically flushed, front/rear washing, and dryer among other things. There is also a good sized sink with enough counterpace.The bed was also interesting. It lulls you to sleep or wakes you up with the use of a vibrations in the bed, lights, and sounds… Very interesting, relaxing/soothing, and effective.I only had breakfast (a buffet) once in the hotel (the restaurant’s name is Hanagoyomi and is on the 15th floor) and it was overwhelming. It’s an extensive and very heavy breakfast which could probably pass as lunch.The concierge was very always helpful in answering any question, directions, places, stores, anything.Checkout was quick and efficient as well.Next time when I will be in Tokyo I will definitely stay at the Ryumeikan again since it is a very good base when visiting Tokyo.","Boca Raton, Florida","GXS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boca Raton, Florida</strong>",29,5.0

It is conveniently located close to Nihonbashi, the Imperial Palace and grounds, the Ginza shopping and theater district, and Tokyo Station where you can get many local subway trains as well as the Shinkansen high speed national train system. Dozens of taxis are lined up waiting to take you anywhere in the city or beyond.This review is based on our 3 day stay at Hotel Ryumeikand in a standard twin, non-smoking room in November 2011.The spacious rooms at the Ryumeikan are decorated in a simple but elegant style and have stunning city views. The beds are heavenly with large, soft pillows and smooth, soft linen. The rooms are very private and quiet. Heavy curtains keep out early morning light but glide back to show a floor to ceiling view of vibrant Tokyo. There is a large desk and ample closet and bureau space. A large chaise longue by the windows give the room the feel of a suite. Everywhere in Japan hotel guests are provided with night wear. At the Ryumeikan, the wonderful soft cotton pajamas and yukatas are especially comfortable.The bath is well appointed with plenty of room for toiletries, many bath amenities and luxurious towels. For those guests planning a longer stay, the hotel provides excellent, clean and inexpensive laundry facilities on every floor. In addition, high speed internet access is free.The staff at the hotel is fluent in English and are very helpful. Because we had two large suitcases, the staff quickly arranged for a second luggage rack. They helped us with dinner reservations, tickets for the Kabuki Theater, and helped us figure out how best to get to Haneda Airport for the domestic flight we were taking as part of our visit to Japan. In our experience, most cab drivers speak only Japanese. If you are concerned about telling the driver your destination, the hotel staff will arrange for a taxi and provide you with a return address card which can be very helpful.In passing, I would like to mention that we traveled to Japan on Japan Airlines (JAL) because they offer foreign visitors a special ""yokoso fare"" on up to five domestic flights. While the trains are a wonderful way to travel while in Japan, the yokoso fare is more economical and faster if you plan to travel longer distances.And two final tips: When attending the Kabuki, be sure to pack a picnic to enjoy during the long intermission. It is the customary thing to do! Make it a special bento or some wonderful bread, cheese, fruit and wine purchased at the bustling but sophisticated food markets in the basement levels of Ginza departments stores like Mitsukoshi or Matsuya. Mitsukoshi also has a branch very close to the Ryumeikan in Nihonbashi. If you arrive in time for the 10 AM opening of this store, you can watch the store staff perform their traditional store opening and special greeting. American tourists will be amazed by the large number of store employees who are friendly and helpful and eager to provide first rate customer service.","San Diego, California","Gail N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",46,5.0

The Japanese room at this hotel is the perfect solution. It is divided with a sliding screen, lovely bedroom on one side and dining area on the other. Two extra mattresses and bedding were all made up for us in the dining side and were very comfortable for the girls. Free drinks in the fridge, fantastic bathroom with loads of toiletries and we requested the balcony room which we got, was also a very nice touch, although there is no view. Location excellent and finally, the staff are superb, extremely helpful and efficient. Based on the suite we had, I would definitely recommend this hotel.","Sale, United Kingdom","Jan142</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sale, United Kingdom</strong>",2,5.0

It was voted 2nd best in the area of Chuo (1st best was fully booked!). I found the price per night quite reasonable - cheaper than a night in a 3 star in London! - and wasn't disappointed.Now Japanese standards are high, we all know that, but this was pure luxury! It is literally less than a 5 minute walk from the MASSIVE Tokyo rail station if you exit by the north exit, and you will spot the tall building straight away as it's clearly marked. Reception is on the top 10th floor, which was a bit weird, but service was excellent and very attentive. My room was impeccable, sound proof and clean, fully equiped with more than you could ask for. The bathroom was pure luxury, the toilet detected that I was in the room so it would heat up the seat as soon as I entered the room, and you don't even have to touch the lid or the seat, a button will do it all for you! The toilet control panel looked like a stereo sound system and had all the usual levels of spray for the ""front"" or the ""back"". The bathroom came with plenty of wonderful towels and the power shower was amazing, it had 3 jets and it was more like a wet room, it even had a stool inside so that you could have a little sit down to enjoy it all - I the same installed in my house! The room is equiped with more gadgets and goodies than you can shake a stick at: Nespresso machine - I was very excited to use one for the first time and for free! - a basket absolutely packed with all sorts in the bathroom, a safe under the bed, a fridge (empty but handy), free bottles of water, free internet, free slippers, free origami (!) a humidifier, shoe horn, shoe brush and shoe polish, flatscreen TV, a super equipped ""office"" area, I was impressed that it even had a kettle and mugs, I thought that was only a UK thing!The bed was pure heaven, it came with 3 different types of pillow but the thing that made a lasting impression on me was the radio alarm system by the bed. The instructions in English were atrocious - honestly I couldn't understand them - but once I managed to get it to work, it woke you up with not only soft music, but soft lighting which got brighter and brighter - very much like a SAD alarm clock - and it even made the bed vibrate very softly to wake you up! What a lovely way to start the day!The Chuo area is mainly a business area so you might find it a bit quiet and dead at night. If so, head down to Ginza, which is only about a 15min walk and you will hit one of the most exciting and visually stunning areas of Japan. There are plenty of restaurants, game centres, shops and vibrant ""yakitori"" restaurants with outside seating and friendly, inviting staff, I loved it! If you want to venture further into crazy Shinjuku, the Tokyo metro in Tokyo station is very handy.I didn't get a chance to try out the restaurant but I'm sure it's an equally amazing experience. All in all: amazing, it made my short stay in Tokyo very special and comfortable, (specially as I had spent 2 weeks volunteering in the north of Japan helping out with the tsunami clear up and the manual labour and basic accommodation were killing me) and hopefully I will stay there again one day.","Oxford, United Kingdom","LetTheSunShineAgain</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oxford, United Kingdom</strong>",37,5.0

It's a good quality upper-mid range business hotel, new and fresh.

Check-in was fairly quick and efficient. As is usual for business hotels, you pre-pay the room charge. The room was comfortable, with a good bed and working space. The wireless internet was free and worked well throughout the hotel. There was one of the highest-tech toilets I've ever used (in the land of high-tech toilets), and a good quality unit bath.

They also have a small library of guidebooks you can borrow to your room during your stay free of charge, which is great.  The hotel is great value if you paid what we did, around 18000 yen per night for three adults.  The area is good for arriving and departing from Tokyo as it is close to Tokyo station where Shinkansen and Narita Express trains go. The shopping however, is soso. It is close to Ginza, but unless you're shopping for international snob brands like Armani and the likes, it's not so good. There are tons of izakayas close to the hotel, and some Karaoke bars. We didn't find a lot of good restaurants though (except for a great classy sushi bar), but it's close to a subway station so it doesn't really matter. We never tried the hotel breakfast buffet as this was the end of a two week trip when we really couldn't take anymore japanese breakfast (but still loved japanese food for lunch&dinner), instead we went to Illy coffee bar close to Tokyo station which served us cappucino worthy of Italy, excellent croissants, and good sandwiches.","Gothenburg, Sweden","GoldPeng</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gothenburg, Sweden</strong>",36,4.0

Helpful staff spoke good English as well. I recommend booking online direct with hotel (try the ""special recommendation"" for a good deal). close to both Tokyo and nihombashi stations. Try dinner or lunch at one of the small booths in Mitsukoshi (mitsukoshi mai store) if you dont want to go to a restaurant - great food at a bargain price and just a few minutes around the corner from the hotel! Or take some food back to your room! There is also washing machines/dryers & drinks machines provisded on 2 floors of the hotel - a useful provision for travellers needed to refresh.
