It is on the edge of the strip bordered by the beach in front and the zoo on one side. I did not pay extra for the ocean view but still had a fabulous view of the beach. The safe was pleasant and helpful. If you are looking for a comfortable but more barebones hotel this is a great option.,,Foot B,6,4.0

Truly 5 star service because of these two! Hedwyne handled some issues early on flawlessly and I could not have appreciated it more! Because of Jeanette recommending the Coconut Club, it made our stay much more enjoyable! I hope these two AMAZING Team members get recognized for there OUTSTANDING customer service. Also a shout out to the hotel in general and the rest of the Team who helped make this experience as wonderful as possible! We left halfway through our trip because of Hawaii's governor shutting things down. I was DREADING asking for a refund on our prepaid trip.

Gorgeous view and nice location at a decent nightly rate (but do remember to include the resort fee). Some commenters have mentioned the need for room refurbishment, but that didn’t bother me much. The furniture is okay, and room is very clean. My problem is that the street noise and live music at Tiki’s are LOUD. My room was on the 8th floor. The musician played until 11pm, which isn’t unusual for bars and restaurants... except my east coast body clock wanted to sleep at 9pm. The street noise and urban campers across the street did not quiet down when the music stopped. I was awaken to yelling and banging multiple times each night. A trade off for the view of the Waikiki beach and sunset.The staff here is wonderful, and I will probably stay here again, but next time I will definitely request a very high floor.","Atlanta, Georgia","klay1970</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",5,4.0

A little warming up needed. Our first experience was the check in and the resort fee which seemed high for 3 nights (US$144). When we queried this we were told we had to pay it with no explanation how it’s calculated or why. We later found we had 4 nights at around AU$290 in our account. This was being sorted by the reception but now have 2 pending deductions in our account. Our check in was late due to our flight delay. This was about 1am and we fell asleep once in the room #1001. The next day it was windy and the balcony sliding door and room entry door made whistling noises all night. Not much sleep has the 2nd night. On the next day the wind has increased and the balcony door was shaking violently. We thought it would blow out. Reception kindly relocated us to a room #1213 in the centre of the tower. The balcony door still whistled but no violent shaking. We slept better. However around 4am there was a group of giggling girls around the pool. We were 12 floors up so glad we weren’t lower as no one was stopping their noise. Eventually they moved. The rooms are very dated and need an overhaul. Old timber built in robes and furnishings. Brown featured carpet. Also the blanket on the bed in our first room had dark brown stains. On the high side is the location opposite the beach and Waikiki walls. Also we had good views of the beach even though it was a city view room. I know this sounds like a whinge but you can see from my other reviews from around the world they’re generally positive. Not sure about staying again. ,"Sydney, Australia","560JohnM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",101,3.0

For $7 a night we were able to upgrade to an oceanfront view rather than ocean view. No brainer! We overlooked the main beach right across the street from the hotel. The location is at the end of the waikiki main drag, so its quieter than many properties, but still within walking distance of everything. The zoo is right across the street, the aquarium is beyond that, and Diamond Head is also adjacent with a nice public park. We loved the security feature of having to scan your room card to get on one of the elevators. The pool is next to the reception area as is a restaurant. The staff brought us frozen fruit cups while we were sitting in the chairs. They also supply you with beach towels and i believe beach chairs, but we didn't use them. The bed was comfy and the room was large. We were able to pay for late checkout at 4 pm since our room was going to be empty. We had a late flight and the hotel has a place to store luggage if you dont have a car and want to hang around town for a while. Valet parking is mandatory if you have a car. Our car was available whenever we wanted it by calling the valet desk. The only thing we can say negative was the lines at check-in and checkout. They need to get more staff during those times, or upgrade their systems to work faster. We got tired of waiting to check out after 10 minutes and dropped our key in a box. They did email us a receipt after i sent them a request. We would definitely stay here again!",,R1440WEdenniss,6,5.0

The first room we were given, had a decrepit bathroom, with towels more suitable to use cleaning up slops rather than for humans. They were so old that the colour was grey and stiff as a board. The floors in the bathroom were filthy, there were three of us in a room, yet we were only given supplies for two. The dusty bedroom had certainly not had a good clean in quite a while. We were unable to remain in such conditions and were moved to an Aloha Suite, this was a little better, but the bathroom was still as bad. The air conditioning ran very cold and we were unable to adjust it, we called the housekeeping, who sent an engineer up to check it out. His verdict was that we should turn it off and open the balcony door, which is not conducive if you want to sleep at night.At no time were we given any information as to the poolside activities, the daily resort fee is a scandalous rip off!This was my fourth visit to Waikiki, and tis hotel managed to mar the 7days we had there.","Blue Mountains National Park, Australia","betty3009</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Blue Mountains National Park, Australia</strong>",57,1.0

The walk from the front-desk, down an escalator, across the street into the sand of Waikiki Beach is, maybe, 45 seconds! Perfect location. If only customer service was as great! It wasn't! Let's start with the resort fee -- $45 for ""a lot of great stuff,"" as I was told. That's a joket! Did not need or want anything that the resort fee covered, and the WIFI was, at best, sketchy. My room was a mess upon check-in, with hangers, toilet paper and more on one bed and a large glass and more on the other. So, I went back to the front-desk for another room. Jeanette at the front desk saw the pictures I took, apologized, asked if I would email her the photos, then gave me an upgraded room. I asked her to reply that she received the pics; she never did. Second room on the 23rd floor, was nice, though only 1 bed and had asked for 2. Received a call in the second room from manager Chris to make everything was OK. I said, yes. He asked if there was anything else he could do for me for the issues; I said, 'You let me know,' hoping he'd waive the resort fee, which I mentioned. He said he'd check and call me back -- no call back! Upon checking-out, manager Gina said she approved a 3-category upgrade, which I knew nothing about, and that's all can and will do, regardless of the WIFI and room issues.

Nice rooms, Tikis is amazing, a fun pool to splash in and a great location.But let me tell you about my guardian angel AKA Allan Antonio AKA the front services supervisor. This man deserves all the praise. My husband, toddler, and I were in a rush to get checked out of the hotel and to the airport to fly out. When we checked our bags at the airport we realized we had lost one along the way. We called the lost and found and they didn't have it. I asked to talk to the valet and they confirmed they had found my bag. I was still in a panic trying to figure out how I was going to get my bag before flying out and figured I would have to pay a high fee to get it sent to my next location, or even worse, leave it behind. Enter: Allan Antonio. He called me and told me would personally drive my bag to the airport to give it to me. From the time we hung up to the time my bag was back in my hand was 25 minutes. I was able to check it and get to my gate in time. My trip would have ended on such a low note if not for Allan going above and beyond to help me out when I needed it most.

For us, having never been to Waikiki Beach we wanted easy access to the beach - you can't get better than Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel for this. Yet after several visits to the beach, we didn't want to be actually on the beach so much due to 1) crowds and 2) homeless/drunks. We couldn't believe how many drunks were loitering around, right next to where kids are playing. We are from NZ where there are some beaches you can pretty much have to yourself most of the year so it was weird squeezing your beach towel on the sand next to somebody! So having now been to Waikiki Beach itself, a hotel ON the beach/directly across from the beach would not be a top priority for us here! If it is your number one thing on your list - you're not going to get much better in terms of beach location,The elevators/reception are at the best of times - FRUSTRATING! The front desk/reception is on the 3rd floor, so when you arrive you either have to take the elevator or escalators up to the 3rd floor where the front desk is - by the pool! IF your room is ready early, you'll then be introduced to the strange elevator system where you press what floor you want into the keypad, swipe your room key and it will tell you which elevator (A, B, C etc) you will need to get into. At times - given that there were only 3 elevators that serviced the ENTIRE hotel (another 3 went up or down from the pool level (3) only) - it was chaos on level 1 waiting for an elevator and it made us not want to pop down or out for coffee etc, knowing we'd have to run the gauntlet of the elevators each way. The rooms are very small, quite dated - and this was a bit one for us - seemingly ZERO noise proofed. You can hear every little thing going on down on the street - and we were 10 floors up! It took brute force to open the ranchslider to go onto the balcony. The bed had NO blankets and just a sheet with another sheet on top. We were cold most nights. A note had been left from the housekeeper saying to let her know if there was anything we needed during our stay. So I left a note asking for some blankets - to no avail! There is NO laundry on site. Never thought this would be an issue for us, but we were there for 8 nights, in and out of wet bathing suits - boy how we could have used a laundry! The closest laundromat was a good 15 minutes away and everything I read said to be careful for the homeless coming in and stealing washing from the machines. Luckily we moved on to Aulani in Ko Olina on our 8th day where the front desk even gave us free tokens for their laundry so we could do some washing while we waited for our room to be ready, The front desk at Aston were always friendly and helpful. Front Desk don't seem interested in going above and beyond for anything though (like the example with Aulani above) When we asked for a luggage trolley to come up on the day we were leaving, they said we'd have to wait 30 minutes at least! So we just struggled with the ridiculous elevator system and 11 items of luggage ourselves! The pool is so over powered with chlorine that we had super red eyes every time we had swam and it's shaded by the hotel itself, which is great on a super hot day, but get's chilly on a colder day. Nothing special about the pool area really. The activities that are run pool-side are great though.The good stuff - the little gift shop on level 1. Given that there are ABC shops what seems like every two steps in Waikiki, I much preferred the little gift shop at Aston. Same prices as ABC on a lot of things, cute little gifts and the ladies that worked there were so lovely. We had selected a partial ocean view room. For a partial ocean view - it was a pretty good view! The NYE fireworks were right in front of us and that was with a SIDE room. So no need to upgrade to an ocean view room if you are offered the chance really.Wolfgang Puck Express was a good, cheap alternative to dining out. Staff are great there and you never have to wait too long. We did miss Wolfgang once we left Waikiki! Right across the road from Honolulu Zoo, short walk to Waikiki Aquarium, a five minute Uber ride to Diamond Head and a few minutes walk to the bus stops - all great points.So we're mixed on this place really. I wouldn't rush to stay there again but it's not the worst hotel I've stayed at. For the price, it could be better though, Definitely in need of a face lift!!!","Auckland Central, New Zealand","ClareHC1974</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",3,3.0

I was contemplating staying at the other end of the strip however I really enjoyed the less hectic pace of the south end with the protected soft sand Kuhio beach for swimming. We did a lot of beach hopping (till we got to the Hilton Hawaiian Village) and was surprised at how crowded and rocky some of the beaches were. In the end, we took up a great returning customer rate at the Aston.Previously on two of my trips I had a premier ocean front room. This last trip I had a partial ocean view room which was a free upgrade. Oh my goodness, the view from the 16th floor overlooking the pool and Waikiki beach was nearly as spectacular as the ocean front rooms. It had a full lani so we often bought tropical fruits at the ABC store on the ground floor of the hotel to eat on our balcony each morning for breakfast along with coffee as the hotel had a Keurig machine with Kona and Paradise pods which weren’t too bad. A total of two per day. My husband took his own green tea so I just heated the water without a coffee pod. I also took some coffee bags with me.The hotel room was small however we were hardly in it (apart from the balcony). The room including the bathroom was clean and well maintained. There are toiletries but no shower caps, so take one with you if required. The king bed was super comfortable. The mini fridge was smallish and could only fit a few cold drinks. The room was serviced each day so we left a couple of dollars tip each morning. As usual, the staff were genuinely friendly and always greeted us with a salutation and were very eager to help in any way. We flew Hawaiian airlines and arrived around lunch time and was given access to our room straight away which was great. Check in/out was super easy.The in-room air conditioning worked well thank goodness as it was quite humid. It’s important to note that hallways and lifts don’t have air conditioning. I utilised the ice machine on our floor twice a day.The Aston’s location and price for same are its biggest drawcards. It’s a no-frills kind of place. No room service. They do have Tiki’s bar and restaurant on level 3 which has wonderful sunset views. They do charge a resort fee as do most places in Waikiki so you need to factor this in as it is over and above your room rate. That said, for similar hotels on the strip I believe it is very good value for money. The other thing worth mentioning is that there are a few different types of rooms and you get what you pay for. If you want a full lani ask for it as some are just stand out only (no chairs). The same if you want an ocean view, or partial ocean view, ask for it however it will cost more. Some room rates include the Coconut Club however this didn’t interest us.For breakfast there is Denny’s around the corner, Lulu’s next door, or the ABC shop downstairs. BTW, this local ABC shop have Costco style hot dogs with toppings for less than $USD2 for a quick lunch before heading out somewhere exciting for dinner. And there are lots of exciting places for that!The hotel has a shuttle service to and from the airport, the flea markets, Pearl Harbour and Waikele outlets which we utilise every visit. There is a trolley stop on the ground floor and a short walk to Kuhio Avenue if you want to take The Bus. It’s a 10-minute walk to the Cheesecake Factory along the main drag.If you have realistic expectations of the Aston you will enjoy staying here as much as I do.",,Cheryl P,13,5.0

We had a week long stay from December 13, 2019 to December 20, 2019. Came to learn that the hotel is now under different management and some things aren't like we remembered. However, this stay was just as good as the one before. There is a $39 resort fee (plus taxes) charged per day which include pool access, gym access, complimentary beach towels and chairs, complimentary sun screen and bottles of water, and I think a few other services we didn't use. We also rented a car for this trip, but quickly had to find an alternative for parking it for the week. Reason being is the hotel doesn't have a parking lot, just valet only. For this service, the hotel gladly charges you a $45 fee per day to park your car on the property. Save yourself a bunch of money and go about a block and a half down the street and park your vehicle in the Banyan Public parking located at the intersection of Kuhio Ave and Paoakalani Ave. Since we were there for the week, the parking structure has a $80 cost for the week to park, or if you're there for 1-2 days, you can pay $20 per day. Either way, don't park your car at the Aston! Beds and pillows were quite comfortable, our view from our lanai overlooked Waikiki beach, which was amazing both day and night. Only real complaint I had about the room is the air conditioner system didn't seem to work all that well in our room and get it as cold as I would have liked. Engineering did come to the room, adjusted the vents, and changed the air filters to see if that would help, but it didn't seem to make the difference. The hotel did offer to move us rooms if we wanted, but we just stayed where we were and I slept with just the top sheet only. It's Hawaii, so not that big of a deal. I also liked having the Tiki' restaurant attached to the hotel so after a day of play, I could come down and sit at the bar and have a nice cocktail, snack, and good conversation with strangers. Ended up coming home with 2 Tiki glass souveniers. Staff at the hotel were always helpful and another added bonus was a small little store on the ground level where you can buy simple things like drinks, sandwiches, small souveniers, snorkel gear, body boards, or small things you may have forgot to pack like toothpaste or a tooth brush. If you want to have more options for souveniors, go around the corner in either direction from the hotel and you will find an ABC Store. Plenty of shopping in walking distance from the hotel up and down the Waikiki Blvd. The Honolulu Zoo is just around the corner from the hotel and is worth checking out, or if you're a hiker, take a small excursion to Diamond Head. I ended up walking all the way to Diamond Head from the hotel and still hiked it too. I don't recommend that and I underestimated how far it was to the entrance. Take the bus or an UBER because the parking lot is always full. My last bit of advice is take a few min and visit the excursion desk for information about family things to do on the island. If you want to get some discounts on some things like Luau's, and if you have the time, take 2 hours out of your day and listen to their presentation on their time shares. You don't have to buy, just spend the 2 hours to get your discounts. The Paradise Cove Luau generally costs $130 per person, but with the discount, that price drops to $30 per person. It's honestly up to you what you want to do with your time.In closing, if we make it back to Hawaii in the near future, Aston is always a hotel we will consider. It really is close to everything you want to do. Anything else is just a short drive from the hotel.

Part of the reason we chose this hotel was for the open air tiki bar/restaurant right on location. As had been mentioned before, the $45 per night resort fee kinda sucked and we were really confused over our access to the Coconut Club. When we checked in we were given an access key to the Coconut Club but were told that is was going to be $89 per day extra which included a continental breakfast and an all you can eat happy hour. After speaking with the front desk a couple of different times we were still confused as to whether or not we could use the club. We eventually went to the club, used our access key and took advantage of the amenities there. We were asked our room number and then were told 'OK'. We asked the attendant on duty if we were okay to use the club and she told us yes so we used it the 2 days we were there. The hotel may want to consider making it a bit more clear whether you have to pay the additional fee or if you have access.Finally, the people at the 'Activities Desk' tried their hardest to lure us into a timeshare presentation. We expressed some interest in doing an excursion and wanted to do something on a boat. They were quick to recommend 2 different boat rides each for a high dollar amount but after their 'discount' the price was more reasonable. The never disclosed any information about the timeshare deal until I finally asked them. I would expect this type of trickery on the street but not at the actual hotel lobby where I assumed they were looking out for their guests best interests. They completely failed to mention a nice inexpensive catamaran boat only a few blocks walk away and right on the beach and instead were pushing for a higher priced boat ride which was miles away. This seemed like a slap in the face to their guests.","Andalusia, Illinois","Brandy4540</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Andalusia, Illinois</strong>",4,3.0

Easy access to good protected swimming area across the street, and a short walk from snorkeling at Sans Souci. Pool area is up off the street (level three), which makes it ideal for families as well as simply relaxing while enjoying the ocean views.

We spent 6 days in Hanalei, Kauai prior to coming to Oahu for 4 days to mainly to tour Pearl Harbor tour and to catch our flight back home. After we saw the room, we quickly decided to rent a car and spend as little time in the room as possible. Best Decision ever!Let me give you a run down of issues:Paid for a ocean view room (not partial ocean view)-see pic with complimentary roof and A/C units from next hotel.Our A/C never cooled below 75 degrees-it’s bad when you come back and have to lay still and naked to cool down.We finally put a towel by the door since hallways were open air.Maintenance guy was called but couldn’t do anything. He sent up a fan, so CALL AND GET A FAN day 1.Don’t stay at a hotel unless it is directly on the beach, otherwise the BUMS in all the pavilions will be your only street view. GROSS. They apparently have enough money though for stems and seeds. Overall cleanliness was low. I kept having to wash my hands to feel clean. If mgmt is reading this have maid clean the shower head and old out of date tile floor better.Tiki’s bar in the hotel is a joke, baking in the cost of a “commemorative glass” into every drink, poor service.The tv is intermittent, finally just turned on music on my portable speakers instead.Turbo jet flush wakes up all others around including neighbors.$45/day resort fee gives you towels and a Walmart collapsible chair, inspect carefully. You could buy brand new chairs everyday for that fee.When we asked for a late check out they gave us an hourly rate...NOT a very good customer service option, more nickel and dime, even after we told them it has not been a good stay.Overall the staff are friendly and mean well, especially the valet guys.The list above should deter you from booking here.

Here are my thoughts.Location:10/10. If you pick this hotel, pick it for the location. It is a few steps from the beach and right in the heart of Waikiki.Price/value for money:I recommend this hotel, as long as you accept that it's a 3-star hotel (They try to sell it as 3.5 or 4 star). You also have to accept that you'll pay a resort fee of >US$40 per room per day when you check out (the fee has gone up). Note- when you book, this is not going to be included in your ""total"" even if your booking says ""fees and taxes included."" But it's best to accept this asap because all decent accommodation will have a 'resort fee'. I will say, there were some cool perks included - for example, you can take beach chairs to the beach and you can borrow GoPros.Views:We opted to pay extra for an ""ocean view"", which turned out not to be facing the sea directly. But the view to the side was nice (see photo from balcony). There are rooms that face the sea directly, so maybe you can request such a room. I must say the ""mountain view"" is also very beautiful. If I were to stay here again I would go mountain view and save a few $$ (I attached a photo of the 'mountain' side). Just don't go 'city view.'Staff:I can't fault the staff. Check in and check out was easy. Just be aware that a queue forms at peak times. We asked advice on taking the bus route and the guy fetched us a map and explained which bus to take. We also got a text when our room was ready (which was much earlier than their 3pm check-in time). Food:I was disappointed to find out that the hotel doesn't have a proper breakfast / eating place. BUT, there is a nice restaurant/bar called Tikis right on the property, next to the pool. The restaurant has ocean views (see photo attached). They have happy hour from 3pm-6pm. You can also grab food at the restaurant right downstairs called Wolfgang Puck Express (not fancy).Now for the Coconut club. You MUST pay the US$30 at least once for the key to the Coconut club. It is a nice dining area on the 21st floor with beautiful panoramic views of Waikiki beach. The rest of the photos I attached are taken from the Coconut club balcony. The US$30 includes breakfast and dinner. The breakfast was kind of disappointing but the dinner was delicious. Everything from cheeses, to sushi, to cookies with cream and ice-cream. The views alone are worth the money.Room/decor:Ok I'm not gonna lie, the carpets/walls/ceilings need to be re-done. But how important is that when Waikiki beach is right across the road? The room was clean and the king bed was really nice.","Sydney, Australia","nadiastain</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",3,4.0

It is not your high end luxury hotels like a Hilton, or Hyatt or similar, but offers adequate rooms with comfortable beds. They have a unique elevator system which is different than any other we've seen. in the exterior hall of the elevators there is a key pad where you scan your room key, then press the floor you are going to and it will show you on a small screen which elevator to catch. It's a good security system. Once on the elevator, there are no buttons to push, rather it simply takes you to the floor you selected. The rooms are small. The so-called partial ocean view in our room was that if you pressed your nose to the window you could peek at a small view of the ocean, but we did have a nice view of Diamond Head. The one criticism of the furniture is that there was a small high table with two wood benches at the table, but no chair in the room. The rooms would be more comfortable with a chair, otherwise the room was ok and again, nothing fancy. The view overlooking the top of the adjacent hotel was of rusty looking air conditioning systems, but I guess with how close most of the hotels are to one another it's not surprising to see that sort of view.",,dougs63riv,1,3.0

The first and second year were nice, we enjoyed Aston’s wonderful staff, continental breakfast was provided, a little welcome package at check-in added a nice touch.Fast forward to our third and fourth years, continental breakfast stopped, but we could still enjoy their free DVDs and daily newspapers. Then comes August 2019, I was told there won’t be any daily newspapers and free DVDs are no longer offered. Im told hotel is under “new management”, hence the changes or should I say, the elimination of some basic accommodations. I paid over $40 per day ($39 plus tax) for resort fee which is supposed to come with two logo water pouches and some other miscellaneous things that are irrelevant and needless. As pathetic as they sound, I still didn’t receive the water pouches!They did some repainting in the rooms and it didn’t really do anything to improve the look, the repainting job actually makes the place appears washed out. The in-room safe keeps malfunctioning and each time we had to have maintenance come to fix it; it took approximately 30 minutes each time they come. In total, I was stuck in my room while they were fixing the safe and lost my vacation time because of the malfunctioned safe!After 5 years, I have never received a thank you for being a regular customer, yet everything is being eliminated to cut cost and I feel like this place is turning into a cheap dingy motel.Sadly to say, this will be our last year staying at the Aston.

Period. Kudos for having a great location, but there are a ton of hotels in the area that have equally great locations and I'm pretty sure provide a better room. In addition, we paid for an ocean view, but got what I would call a partial ocean view. You could see the ocean if you went outside on the balcony, but not from in the room. Service was ok. Daily housekeeping was a little spotty. Our room was skipped more than once. Elevators are super slow. AC in the room wasn't great. It was set pretty high when we arrived (which is fine. Save some energy, I get it...) and we tried to lower it to a more reasonable temp and it literally took 2 days for it to get to that temp (like 72/73). And you had to keep the curtains closed. If we let the sun it, it couldn't keep up and the temp would go up to 75/76.TV was also super frustrating. The remote didn't work very well, it had one of the old scrolling guides, signal was really spotty, and the guide wasn't even accurate half the time!

I stayed here a few years ago when the hotel had been beautifully decorated in a vintage Hawaiian style that was very colorful and modern. It was disappointing to see that everything had been painted beige. It looked like the hotel was trying to achieve what they thought was an upscale look, when in actuality now because it hasn't been completely redone, it's left with a mishmash look that's neither upscale or charming like the original vintage Hawaiian look. Also more shade and landscaping around the pool would go a long way. Virtually all of the hotel guests sought out the shady bits, leaving the exposed lounge chairs unused. Much could be done to improve the check in process to make it a bit more humane. How about a complimentary drink and a place to sit while you work it out on an iPad? I spent a lot of time imagining how this hotel could be improved!The maid service is very good and the staff working here is a nice group of people, but don't expect any information on Hawaiian activities or interests outside of the basic tourist brochures. Case in point - I had booked a group tour for the Doris Duke Shangri La House tour. You have to take a shuttle to the Honolulu Museum to get there and not one person had any idea of what I was talking about regarding either the tour or how to get the shuttle to the museum. Ironically there was a sign right in front of the hotel that had the museum name & logo indicating the bus stop!Overall this place needs work. The best thing about the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel is the proximity to the great beach right across the street and the fact that it's on the end of the strip away from all the malls, giving it a more relaxed feel.I guess you are saving a bit when compared to other places right on the beach in Waikiki.",,Exploration573122,1,3.0

Not expensive, so don't expect lux. The one thing I have to criticize, which can be easily dealt with, is that theres not enough shade around the pool. Not enough umbrellas, and no planted trees. How easy would it be to fix this?! The whole week I stayed here, I saw people clamoring for a shady spot around the pool, to no avail. I had no option but to sneak into other hotel pools that had some shade around them. Would have been nice if I could have stayed put at my own hotel and had a seat under an umbrella. That being said, everything else was decent. The view from our room was lovely, and the maid service was superior, they were really sweet, and on it, everyday. On another sad note: across the street at the beach, I witnessed a drowning, or near drowning the evening of Aug. 14th. It was horrifying, I can't stop thinking about it. Does anyone out there have any information about this sad episode? I asked everyone, including the lifeguard on duty the following day, no one has any info., and I can't find anything out on the net.

It was me, my husband and 13-year-old daughter. We booked this hotel based on the location and price. Price was great for the location, which cannot be beat. It is at the end of Waikiki near Diamond Head, right by the zoo. And right across from the beach and a park. The only drawback was the ocean across the street has a big wall which doesn't allow for much swimming - so we walked about a block down the beach where the wall stopped and my daughter was able to swim. It's beautiful and she could basically snorkle and see lots of fish right there. Beach is crowded because it's public beach access but it wasn't terrible. The only other negative thing to our stay was that there was a ton of construction going on in front of the hotel - the sidewalks are blocked off, so walking was a pain and got too crowded and noisy due to the construction. The hotel itself is quite nice. Nothing fancy, the rooms are well appointed and clean but not very big. We did not really have a balcony, more of a tiny, narrow ledge. But it suited our needs because we didn't come to Hawaii to hang out in the room or the hotel! The pool area is very nice - lots of seating and umbrellas and I love that they have towels and beach chairs you can rent for free each day. They also have water available as well as good sunscreen. One afternoon, they came by with pineapple shaved ice for everyone, free of charge. There are also game areas with large Connect 4 and large Jenga, which was fun. We played those while waiting to eat dinner one night at Tiki's. We have eaten there before and we love that restaurant. Other than Tikis there is not another hotel restaurant, although there are quite a few options right downstairs - Wolfgang Puck, a smoothie place, cookie place and Subway.We liked the smoothie place for breakfast as they had breakfast bowls but did try Wolfgang Pucks one morning - it was overpriced but OK but did have a nice area to eat outdoors.There is a covered area with lots of seating where we'd eat some mornings and it's also where you wait for buses for tours and airport transportation. There's a small gift shop as well.We had a nice stay at this hotel and I would recommend it to anyone looking for budget-friendly but still nice place to stay in Hawaii. As long as you're not looking to hang out all day at the hotel, this hotel is perfect as homebase while touring all there is to see in beautiful Hawaii.","Greensboro, NC","Tikicisti</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greensboro, NC</strong>",41,3.0

A lovely lady called Pilar was there in the coconut club every morning during the week and she never stopped working keeping the place immaculate.We ate at the Tiki restaurant in the hotel one night and the meal was excellent.The parking fee at $45.00, we thought, was very expensive and taking advantage of the fact that you have no choice but to pay it.","Feilding, New Zealand","Vanessa D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Feilding, New Zealand</strong>",20,4.0

There was a terrible piercing noise in our room and when the maintenance guy came up it turned out it was the toilet. He fixed it for a couple of hours and then it went all night ! I also paid the extra for a club room and by the time we checked in we were ready for a drink, can you believe they do not serve any alcohol in their club room ?? Maybe it should have been rename a kids room. I have travelled all around the world and never have I been to a club room without alcohol. We walked straight out in disgust. I complained to the manger as it was advertised when I booked that there was alcohol but apparently they changed there policy a couple of weeks before we arrived. I said it was terrible and maybe they should have contacted everyone who had paid for a club room the option to remove it from their room. Not worth the extra money... we ended up going downstairs to the bar and paying for our drinks. The manager offered me a $30 refund, big deal but I never even received that.

There is a Denny's around the corner (if you want something familiar for breakfast) as well as, a Pancake House within walking distance. For your convenience, you are able to rent towels and chairs for the beach. The only reason for the 4 star was because the concierge did not really help us.

The Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel is beachfront down the zoo end of Waikiki across the road from Kuhio Beach and it’s a pleasant 10 minute walk to the centre of the strip. Location, location, location. There is a trolley stop and tour bus pick up /drop off just near the concierge desk. It was a short walk to Kuhio Avenue to get The Bus.Just got home from my second visit to Oahu and my second stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel. They kindly gave us a 20% discount as returning customers. I requested and was given the same room as last time on the 10th floor in a premier oceanfront room which was a pleasant surprise as I did not really expect it. The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable as last time. The view from the full lanai (witch had two chairs) was stunning as I had remembered it. Many a morning and night it was well utilised to watch the sunsets, fireworks and two different parades for King Kamehameha and the Pan Pacific Festival or to just chill.There is a small fridge and Keurig coffee machine in the room that was well used. They give you two free coffee pods every day. The toiletries were good quality however there was no shower cap so I would advise you to take one as I did. There is a safe, a hairdryer and an iron with ironing board and two bathrobes for use. The room was serviced every day and supplies were replenished. We left housekeeping a few dollars tip each day as I imagine it is back breaking work. We always left the room clean and tidy for her. The wifi was brilliant. Never an issue. Same with the in room air conditioning. There was an ice machine on our floor which was handy to refill our drink bottles with iced water before going out exploring.We used the pool area to cool down after a day out touring which was quick and refreshing along with a cocktail from Tiki’s bar. Economical too if you go during happy hour (s). You can’t charge to your room so you will need some cash. You can sign out pool towels and beach chairs to use outside of the hotel without cost. With the beach across the road this was very handy.One of the stand out aspects of this hotel is the staff. Sean on the front desk was friendly, professional and informative as we arrived after our long flight and he got us into our room within minutes. Mercy the room attendant was unobtrusive, thorough, and always greeting us with a smile and aloha (as did every staff member we came across). The lifts have a unique system which I think work very well. You punch in your room number and scan your door card and you are directed to a particular lift. This is a good safety feature. It seems to group floors together. That is, floor 10 and over, levels one and three etc.One day, we got the hotel shuttle to Waikele outlets for $16 each return. They had various pick up and drop off times. We had used their Pearl Harbour shuttle the visit before. Anyway, I accidently left a perfume package in the shuttle. I had so many bags that day! The kind concierge organised for it to be dropped off the next day. I didn’t get his name however I would like to thank him very much.This was a no frills kind of place however I believe the Coconut Club has just been launched which would suit some people.Thank you Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel for another wonderful stay.

It is obvious absolutely nothing has changed in 7 years in regards to hotel upkeep. The Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel is in dire need of renovations. The mattresses on the beds, sofa beds & furniture in the lobby all desperately need replaced. The bathrooms need new tile, room carpet is dirty & tired. Loungers around the pool need replaced. We had a junior suite (room 2028) with 4 people. This room has ample space for 4 people and a stunning ocean view. We were only given 3 towels & 2 coffee cups each day. We had to call housekeeping every day to ask for additional items to accommodate 4 people, which was frustrating day after day (despite tipping $5 each day). The hotel no longer offers a complimentary continental breakfast. There is a “club level” which you can opt in to (for a high daily fee) which provides a continental breakfast & snacks each evening. This is the first “club level” I have experienced that only offers “mocktails” in the evenings. If cocktails were included the club option would be much more worthwhile & attractive. The line at the front desk was always long & slow. The best aspect regarding Aston is the location & ocean views.

Its location is top notch being in the center of Waikiki with a gorgeous beach right across the street. Check in and check out can be time-consuming with a significant wait in a long line, though the bellhops in reception quickly took our bags and secured them in storage until our room was ready. In general, the room supplies were on the stingy side with only 2 sets of towels, 2 K cups of coffee, and 2 styrofoam cups in a room with 2 beds intended for 4 people. Their elevators drove us nuts! You must swipe your key card then enter your floor and it then tells you which elevator to take. There is no indicator light to let you know if the elevator is going up or down and you can't select a floor inside the elevator at all so if it misses your floor you must exit the elevator and start over again. The restaurant, Tiki Bar and Grill, was top notch and we enjoyed several meals there. Would I stay here again? Probably.

There is a fridge in the room and there are loads of ABC convenience stores around so we bought yoghurt and muffins for breakfast in the room.My advice is if you have a car try to stay as far away from Waikiki as possible.  It will be a longer drive to and from the airport but it would be worth it ...then Just get the tram into the city when you want to take it on.

The best thing about this hotel is it’s location. It is literally steps to the beach. We booked a premier ocean view room and the view was just gorgeous. We were on the 18th floor and even though we were high up, sometimes it was a bit noisy. The road outside our window was always busy with tour busses, trolleys and people, but we never had an issue with noise while sleeping at night. We took a nap almost every afternoon to regenerate and had no problem falling asleep. You have to understand that this is a hotel in a major tourist city so some level of outside noise is to be expected.The hotel could use a facelift and that I guess, is why the rates were reasonable for a hotel with a prime location. Hawaii is very expensive and hotel choice is a major part of the overall trip cost. The Aston Walkiki fit our desire for a great view without breaking the bank. That said, our room interior was nothing to write home about. The bathroom was small and outdated, but the water pressure in the shower was great. The shower head was not high enough for a tall person. The walls needed a fresh coat of paint with color. Our room was not as pretty as the one pictured on their website. There were two sad pictures on the wall that did not represent the abundant beauty of the island. There was not really space in the room for a chair and a chair would have been nice. There was a small table and two stools, but the stools did not have any backs to them. The room, however, was clean and we had no issues. I’m not complaining, just stating the facts. This is no luxury hotel, but luxury would have cost a lot more.All the staff members we encountered were very friendly, especially the housekeeping staff. We saw them most days in the hallway and they always spoke to us and made us feel welcome.A nice feature is that the hotel has beach towels and chairs you can check out each day. They also give you portable water pouches that you get to keep. They have a water filling station near the towel area. We took them everywhere and it saved us money.The elevator system is different than any other we’ve encountered, but it was no problem. There are two restaurants on site, Tiki’s, which was more upscale and had live music, and Wolfgang Puck Express, which was open from 7 am to 10 pm. We had a pizza and a Hawaiian pork sandwich one evening at Wolfgang Puck’s and both were very good.Overall, the hotel is in a very desirable location. You can easily walk to shops and restaurants. Many tour companies pick you up right in front of the hotel. Starbucks is steps away and opens at 4 am.There is a daily resort fee and parking is valet only. If you rent a car you can save on the $45/day parking fee by renting at Enterprise across the street and return the car to them each day. There is also a parking lot near the zoo that costs $1/hour that comes in handy.Overall, we had a good experience here.","The Woodlands, Texas","ThatTexasChick</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>The Woodlands, Texas</strong>",24,4.0

Our first 4 nights, we always had a cockroach in the bathroom. We called Front Desk to help and they came up with housekeeping to spray our rooms but the next few days we still had issues. Maybe it's the maintenance/engineering aspect of the hotel that needs fixing. Also, Front Desk is short staffed and I feel that we always had to wait 15-20 mins just to ask questions because there were only two people at the desk.I do appreciate the hotel being right across the beach, close to shopping malls and not near congested tourist spots.

The front desk accommodated us and were very nice: this was still considered ocean view but more scenic. Thanks to Connie Teresa and Gin! If we asked for extra coffee ,they brought us 4, bottle openers bought immediately etc. We researched all hotels and found out that most hotels charge the resort fee everyone hates. Airbnb vrbo May not , but hotels do. For the location and view and price we made our decision and we were very happy no complaints. King room comfortable always clean, a bit dated, unique elevator system which we found was much quicker, less waiting around. We booked with Costco, price included free cancellation up to 2 days prior , most Airbnb don’t include this , airport transfors and vouchers for food at Wolfgang puck express at hotel 1 voucher per person , per day we were there 9 days 18 vouchers and not one bad meal, great portions as well. Part of resort fees were the fold up black chairs and towels these came in quite handy. Beach very clean less busy, if you have small children water very calm, location is great because you can walk easily to busier section but then come back to quieter end of strip, we rented a car for a day enterprise at Marriott right next door, very easy. If you rent for several days you might want to park at zoo 5 minute walk they charge 1dollare an hour.Waikiki has so many great restaurants , you can make your trip as expensive or as inexpensive as you want, do some research, check out utube videos on where to eat some really cheap, and yes we tried some and they were awesome, me bbq, markome udon, island vintage for the best açai bowls and shave it,musubi snack bar , go to a luau, go to the north shore Haunama bay , climb diamond head but plan plan!! we watched a lot of videos lol it was great trip.","LaSalle, Canada","augger59</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>LaSalle, Canada</strong>",1,4.0

The hotel is an older hotel that has been renovated and it is literally across the street from Waikiki beach. You cannot beat the location! Also the hotel provides you with a great reusable water bottle to refill at the filtered water stations they have and you can check out wonderful beach chairs and towels to take to Waikiki. The beach chairs made our beach day very enjoyable and people on the beach even asked us where we scored the great chairs. For sunset you can sit at the pool chairs and watch the sun go down literally across the street. The fireworks on Friday you can watch from a pool chair as well. The Tiki bar has great happy hour deals and their drinks are delicious! We took a city bus one day and the stop was a few blocks from the Aston, making it very convenient and inexpensive to get around. Overall we loved our stay at the Aston and everyone who works there made it thoroughly enjoyable.

We traveled during the very busy holidays, and while we would have preferred to stay in a condo-type room, this is where we ended up. I booked an Ocean View Aloha Suite with a lanai. While I realize not all rooms will have a view, or the same type of view, let me warn you as to what they consider ""ocean view"". Our room was on the 5th floor (528) facing Diamond Head. The lanai was probably about 18 inches deep, barely room for two people to stand. The ""lanai"" was also about 6 inches above a roof covered in bird droppings. There was an animal trap that appeared to be put together with miscellaneous things someone found in the garbage. The front desk said the ""state does that to control the birds"". Um ok. In addition to all that, there was virtually no view. Maybe if you stood on tippy toes and leaned out over the ""lanai"" you could get a glimpse of a couple palm trees and a little water. Not a view. Certainly not one to pay a premium for, which I did.The rooms are small. Beds are double beds, not queens. Bathroom is tiny and dated with very little counter space. The décor is blah, furniture is kind of beat up and old.After checking in, I called down and asked about the crummy view. ""Not all rooms have views, sorry."" I asked to be moved, even if it was the next day. ""We have nothing available."" I was offered a break on the resort fee and free breakfast, which was nice, but it didn't change that the last 4 days of our vacation (we were in Maui prior to arriving in Honolulu) was in this room with a lousy view. They said there was nothing they could do. We were very disappointed.I booked this trip through Costco. I called the next morning and asked if they could help. Their rep called the front desk, and what do you know? We were moved for the last two nights to a room with a lovely view and a real lanai (1427). This is what I expected for what I paid. We got a king instead of two beds, and used the sofa bed and a roll away for my mom and daughter, which worked out fine. Sean at the front desk went over and above to get us the room early in the day. He was professional, understanding, and super nice about the whole thing. Overall, I would say this is an ok place to stay. While outdated and in need of renovation, the rooms were clean. Housekeeping was friendly and very responsive to requests for towels, etc. The pool set up is strange and small, we didn't use it. But, the proximity to the beach is great, and the hotel providing towels and chairs is a nice amenity. The valet service is efficient and the guys are great, they even went to our car to get something we forgot. Make the view the priority when booking, it is what makes up for where the hotel lacks in other areas.Huge thanks to Sean...his efforts saved the last part of our trip.

The room is quiet small with an outdated bathroom; the wall is quiet thin, but we still had decent rest. Instead of heading off to the other islands or mainland for Christmas, we decided to do a staycation on the island. As expected, you pay for the view and location, if you are looking for somewhere that is modern and luxurious, this is not the place. The valet parking is $35 per day with tax, resort fee is about $37 and the ocean room is about $260 per night, so you are looking at $330 per night, which is still relatively cheap in comparison with likes of Hyatt or Sheraton in the vicinity.

We really enjoyed our 4 nights at this hotel. Yes, as others have mentioned in their reviews, the hotel is old. We really don't care about old, we care about clean and a top location with a fantastic view. We booked a premium ocean front room and were so glad we did! Fantastic location with uninterrupted views of the ocean. A small balcony but we did not have anyone stay in the rooms either side of us, that we know of, so the balcony was very private. Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. I am a terrible sleeper usually, but slept fine here. We spent most days exploring Oahu and came back to our room to catch the sunset each night while enjoying a mai tai cocktail. We thought the cost of our room was reasonable considering the excellent location. A tip for people complaining they did not get the ocean view they wished for - you need to book and pay for 'oceanfront', then you will not be disappointed. The staff on reception, concierge and tour desk were all helpful and we are still using our complimentary drink bottles today. Tiki's Bar & Grill at the bottom of the hotel has excellent food, drinks and service.We have stayed at Waikiki before in a different hotel who fairly recently did a total upgrade, then tripled their rates.

I thought the hotel was great! It was by far the most affordable hotel close to the beach (it's literally right across the street). Yes it's an older hotel, however it was more than adequate. We booked an Ocean View room and were on the 24th floor. The view of Diamond Head and the beach were fantastic! The room was very clean and spacious, had a small balcony, a big TV, wifi, an in-room safe, fridge, coffee machine, etc. The beds were really comfortable and it was quiet at night.The pool at hotel was lovely - we would visit the beach in the morning and then when it got a bit hot for us we went to the pool for a while, as it is in the shade until the early afternoon. The hotel has towels and chairs you can use and take to the beach. I didn't love the $35 US resort fee, however I was aware of it when I chose this hotel.We did eat at Wolfgang Puck Express a couple of times which was good, as well as the Tiki Restaurant located right beside the pool. You can actually get nice views of the beach from the restaurant, depending on where you are sitting.Our flight back to Vancouver was not until 11:30pm so we were able to arrange a late checkout (for $75) and had our room until 6pm, which worked out perfectly.There are so many great restaurants in the area (there is an Italian Restaurant one block from the hotel which was fantastic, and not too expensive either), as well as shopping (I dare you to count all the ABC Stores in Waikiki, lol). I was able to buy a beach umbrella from ABC for $18 to use at the beach which was perfect, as the hotel does not have beach umbrellas for guests to use.The hotel is near the end of Kalakaua Avenue, so it's less busy there which was nice. There is a nice park right next to the hotel and getting to Diamond Head is easy as it's not far from the hotel at all.Overall I was really pleased with this hotel - all of the staff we encountered were so friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.","Vancouver, Canada","Allison B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",16,4.0

Complimentary water bottles were provided and water filling stations are easily located on the 1st and 3rd floors, which we used to fill the keurig. The elevator system is a bit awkward at first but after you scan your key card, you type in your floor and the panel assigns an elevator to you, which actually makes it convenient to avoid overcrowding in the elevators. Room service and coffee is provided every morning and you can request extra k-cups and cream/sugar packets if you’re a heavy coffee drinker. The hotel is also conveniently located down the street from local food spots, the Honolulu zoo, and bars.This was honestly the best vacation I’ve ever had, waking up to the sounds of the ocean waves crashing on the shore as sunrise hits the diamond head ridge is perfect for couples to take in and appreciate.

The view was awesome but the room had 2 double beds (not our first choice) and the dresser and table and chairs was lined up across the other side of the room. It was very cramped feeling meaning too much furniture and poor layout. We also did not like the security measures. It was difficult and time consuming to swipe a card and your floor every time and wait for the specific elevator. Sometimes it was so busy it wouldn't take your floor. Specifically, the last night we were in the room at 4 in the morning we heard a horrific noise coming from the room above us. It was a horrific scratching noise that woke both of us from a sound sleep. We both got up and checked the vents and bathroom convinced something was trying to get into the room.

Will try to do this in point form (pardon typos as I'm using a tablet which I am not quite used to yet)Location: great location directly across the street from the walled in area of Waikiki Beach which made us feel safe relaxing on float tubes. Variety of restaurants at street level and other places such as Danny's, Burger King etc a short walk away. Close to bus stops and Honolulu Zoo.Room: had a room on 15th floor with wonderful view of Waikiki Beach. Great place to watch surfers in distance and Friday night fireworks. We found the room a decent size for the 2 of us and it was very clean. We had a small issue of the pin lock on the patio Door not working part way through our stay. Stopped at front desk to let them know on our way out to supper. When we came back an hour later it was all fixed. Keurig machine in room with K-cups replenished each day - was wonderful to have coffee and sit on balcony. Facilities: pool area was nice. Pool never seemed crowded. A few afternoons that we were at the pool they came around with flavoured shaved ice or a frozen grape and pineapple dessert cup. Towels and beach chairs available for sign out. Staff: the staff was very friendly and efficient. Always an ""Aloha"" and a smile. Mia checked us in and was wonderful. Glenn checked us out at the end. Our housekeeper Zeneaida was sweet. Check out day: check out is at noon but many flights don't leave until very late at night. After check out you can put your luggage into the bell services on the 1st floor but you can still use the facilities such as the pool and washrooms until your transport arrives to take you to the airport. We really appreciated this so we enjoyed an extra 8 hours of pool and lounge chair time.A couple of suggestions: (1) would be nice if there were 2 chairs on balcony so we could both sit out together. (2) realize there are smoking laws but it would be nice if the hotel could create a designated smoking section that only hotel guests could access. Some of the homeless that approached us looking for cigarettes, money etc made us feel uncomfortable/nervous.Summary: good value for location and amenities. Would stay here again no problem at all.

This hotel is located at one of the most touristic areas of the island which is great and convenient for may, they have some cool outdoor like lobby where overviewing of the pool is a gift as you come in. HERE IS THE MESS THOUGH, the service at the checkin is very disorganized, people here do not know information about reservations and more than one person has to get involved at the time just for checkin!Another crazy time here and this one will take some time for the rant is the ELEVATORS, this place has the weirdest elevator system I have ever seen and I must say I did not like it at ALL. You SACN YOUR KEY and get an elevator letter, once that door opens you go in and it will take you to your floor. The only good thing I saw with this system is the fact that you avoid a long elevator ride and at worse will be stoping only a couple of times before your own flair. BUT THERE ARE SO MANY NEGATIVES HERE: - This hotel is pretty busy so you may endure a line to scan you card to find out what elevator you on!!! This is insane!!!!! - If you do not have your key….. no access to the elevator, this is again a very busy hotel so you may have to endure a line to get a new key and now a line to get on the elevator. - Going down the elevator is as weird as going up, now you need to press a button # to get you down but nobody tell you!!! - You want friends to come to your room??? Nope! You need to go down to get them, cause they need to SCAN A KEY!!!The list of inconveniences is vast here with these elevators.The room is pretty great, I had a partial view of the beach and it was amazing to see the sunset from my balcony. This hotel also houses one of the most yelp stared restaurant bars of the island so that is definitely a plus. This hotel had some great things to it as far as location, accommodations and some of the amenities, but I think that here the pice does not justify as this place has too many negatives that by a long shot out weights the good things.

We then went on to cruise home to Sydney via French Polynesia and New Zealand.The view from our full lanai was stunning and well worth the extra cost for this room in my opinion. It made me constantly “feel” I was finally in Hawaii. We would often sit on the balcony with a view that changed constantly depending on the time of day. I never tired of it. The hotel is located adjacent to the Park Shore Hotel and the Zoo in the quieter end of Waikiki. It was an easy 10-minute walk to Waikiki central. My daughter and I always felt safe walking home at night. The staff at this hotel were friendly, helpful and professional at all times. There was availability on arrival to pay $USD60 for an early check in which was much appreciated after arriving from Sydney at 6am. Those overnight flights are brutal if you can’t sleep on a plane (like me). Check in (which is usually 3pm) and check out (usually midday) was super easy and fast. Natasha at the front desk made us feel very welcome. We ended up checking out earlier and just left our keys in a drop box. The pool area was very pleasant and good for a quick dip after a full day out touring. The hotel has a shuttle service that we used to get to Pearl Harbour, $USD32 return which was on time in an air-conditioned mini bus. Great value for me. The WIFI worked beautifully with no issues except that it was dicey trying to summon an Uber from the street as you need an internet connection to do so and it didn’t quite have reception that far. I enjoyed swimming at Kuhio Beach across the road to cool down on many occasions. The ocean was refreshing and not cold. You could check out towels and deck chairs without charge which I felt was a very good service. The Outrigger on The Beach charges you by the hour I believe. On check in, you can collect an Aston water bottle at the pool area that you can fill with iced water and then there are ice machines on some floors, including ours, to refill it as needed. One thing about this hotel is that there is no room service and we knew that when we booked. It didn’t bother us in the least because there were 2 ABC stores, a Wolfgang Puck Express, a Jamba Juice, a cookie store and a Subway on the ground level.Tikis grill in the pool area was lovely too. Independent of the hotel. You could have a light meal by the pool with drinks or dine in the restaurant for a more a la carte menu. There was nightly music and entertainment. We were on the 10th floor and the music was enjoyable, not intrusive.For a lovely Italian meal, I can recommend Arancino Di Mare just one block from the Aston. Beautiful food at moderate prices. A nice change from the American type food available everywhere in Waikiki. The portions are smaller however I prefer quality over quantity. The lifts at the Aston are unique. I won’t explain here except to say that they worked well. We never waited long. Every day you get two pods of coffee for the in-room coffee machine. I really appreciated this perk. Newspapers are available on every floor every morning. One more thing. I so enjoyed my first time in Hawaii that I am going back again in June 2019 and the hotel are giving me 20% off the advertised rate as a returning customer. That is very good customer service.

I've stayed here multiple times based on location and price (I stayed previously as well in July 2018) and each room seems to have the same issues, however for fairness I am now specifically rating room 1721 which is considered to be a premium room, as follows: The tile and grout in the bathroom need to be cleaned.The bathroom has yellow tile that was painted over with white wall paint on one side and left yellow on the remaining sides. The towels are course and thread bare. The door sticks when shut and needs maintenance. The closet doors squeak and the safe inside the closet doesn't work.The carpet in the room and hallway is old thin and dirty. Air from the open air hallway enters the room through the worn out gaskets around the door.The sliding glass door is not sealed correctly to the building opening and when the door is closed the outside air enters the room.Noise from 17 floors below can be heard when the sliding door is shut due to the worn out gaskets and lack of sealing of the sliding door to the building. Air entering the rooms from the hallway and the sliding doors prevents the room air conditioning unit from cooling the room.If you want to sit on the balcony you can see in the next room as there is no partition between the balcony to allow for privacy and noise reduction.The room could use some sound proofing so you don't hear the guests above, below and on either side through the walls, floor and ceiling.When I was younger I was a member of a college fraternity and staying at this hotel allows me the opportunity to re-experience my college years!",,Alan C,0,3.0

The pool area is nice snd very clean. There is no room service, which is a huge drawback. You cannot charge things to your room from the pool snack bar, the bar/restaurant near the pool or the convenience store on the first floor. These are all real limitations. The TVs in the room are not that easy to figure out and there are no real instructions. They have a free DVD rental service, which is a nice perk. But using the PS4 to play the DVDs is not that easy. We used our computer. Our first room was a disaster, the two beds were tiny and we needed to upgrade, which was not that big of a problem, though it cost $40 a day. But that money was well worth it. We were upgraded to a suite with a good, but not great, view, because they ran out of the ocean view rooms I paid to upgrade to. The suite was comfortable and nice. The only thing old about the room was the bathroom, which could use an upgrade. The maid service was really great; the women work very hard and do a nice job. We had a clogged bathtub one day that I reported, and it was fixed with a note when we returned. It is a real overcharge to charge $35 a day for parking. It also is a little ridiculous to share the resort fee. It was also supposed to be no smoking, though I smelled the thick sweet stench of marijuana smoke in the hallway almost every evening, I don't really care but why have the policy if you let this happen without consequence? All of the staff with whom I dealt were very nice and helpful. I did see people in arguments about things, but that did not happen to us. I wish they had bartenders taking orders around the pool. I wish the snack bar by the pool could be charged to the room, as well as the bar and convenience store on 1. But that is their deal.

With that being said, the lobby area and elevators and hallways are open air in a very humid climate making it feel more like a motel, the bathrooms were disgusting, and maid service was a bit rude to us when she came to clean after we came back from spending the morning out and about. We had an ocean view room which had a lovely view but we were too scared to go on the lanai as it felt unsafe. The bathrooms were old and dated, which is okay, but they also were filthy with stains everywhere (the non permanent and perfectly cleanable with a good scrub variety) and were really tiny. Because of this we were so uncomfortable being in there. Being across from Waikiki Beach it was super convenient for washing off the sand, so perhaps that’s why the bathrooms were in such bad shape. Nonetheless, this ruined our stay there and we retreated to another hotel for a few nights of our stay (which was 300x better). The front desk was friendly and helpful however. The ocean view room was tiny and uncomfortable for two adults and a toddler.

This was my 8th trip to Hawaii, but my first time at this hotel. Room was tired and in need of a makeover. Was not like the pictures. Was not impressed by being told that we “had to pay” a “resort fee” upon arrival. Have never been charged or paid a resort fee before. After a long flight we could not really be bothered arguing and just wanted to get to our room so managed to negotiate a reduction in the resort fee to $25USD per day, from $35USD. We were not happy about it, but just wanted to get our room! We were told the resort fee was for ammenities, Wi-Fi, beach towels, pool side snacks, local calls, use of the gym and a daily newspaper, that we did not use for the entire stay. When asked why we had to pay the staff and manager could not provide any information as to why we must pay, other than that we had to, with no explanation! I have since researched this so callled resort fee charge and have identified that it is no compulsory, it is not legislative and appears to just be a money grab, or a made up fee, for the unsuspecting traveller. Frankly, I would expect all the above amenities to be provided at a hotel. First of all the premises is a “hotel” and not a “resort”. We questioned this upon check-in and were met with blank faces with no explanation. Had to attend the check-in area some days later in respect of an enquiry and overheard an American guest arguing about the resort fee, which was subsequently wiped in full. When I questioned as to why they were excused from the resort fee and we were not, I was again met with blank expressions and no explanation, and told that we were unable to receive a refund for our “resort fee” payment! Why was the other fee waived and ours not? Well that’s the $1000,000 question. Frankly it just appears to be a fee for the unsuspecting traveller. My suggestion is to stand your ground and use this review as an example as why not to pay the resort fee! Needless to say we will not be using this hotel again, however we still give it a 2/5 for our experience, but would have been a 3.5 had it not been for the resort fee fiasco! Include it in you price and not hit the unsuspecting traveller after a 10 hour flight upon arrival! By the way the housekeeper was 1st class, and did a great job every day!

The hotel was great to us and helped us get rebooked for an additional two nights, and although we weren't able to stay in the same room, we were very excited to experience an ocean front room for our extra days! Tiki's (the restaurant) was awesome, and we really enjoyed sitting on the 2nd floor deck and looking at the ocean and people watching.

The property was in a great location directly across from Kuhio Beach on the quieter end of Waikiki. I rented a car and arrived at the valet on the first floor where they directed me to the third floor for registration which is located by the pool and the adjacent Tiki Bar. The Tiki Bar is very nice. There is a $35 a night parking fee and it’s valet only, but the valet service was outstanding. Friendly and quick service. When you need your car, just call valet 15 minutes ahead of time and they’ll have it waiting for you. Check-in experience was great. Kalehua greeted me with a smile and was fast and efficient. She confirmed my reservation for an ocean view room with two double beds, but when I told her I would be the only one in the room, she asked if I would prefer a king bed instead and if I wanted to be on a higher floor. When she learned I had family on the island, she asked if they were OK since Hurricane Lane had just passed 2 days prior. Her genuine caring, helpful and friendly service truly represents the aloha spirit of the islands. She explained all that was included with my room rate and gave clear instructions on how to use the elevator. The elevators are like those that you find in some hotels in Vegas and California where you select your floor number BEFORE you get into the elevator and the screen will assign you an elevator. The property is very secure because you must scan your key card in order to select a floor. Kalehua closed out the check-in process with a follow up call to make sure everything was to my satisfaction after settling into my room. Great job by Kalehua!I was happy with my room, 2411. It was clean and comfortable. The view of Waikiki Beach and the ocean was so relaxing. Housekeeping did a great job and when I needed it cleaned at a certain time one day, they honored my request without a problem.The resort fee included free wifi, a free water bottle, water service by the pool and towels for the beach. There is also a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, Subway and Cookie Corner on property.Overall, I had a great stay and I’m already looking at staying at this property next year.","San Diego, California","sdpow</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",26,5.0

The atmosphere was relaxed and fun, the bell boy service was prompt and easy, the Tiki bar grill provided pool-side service to the hotel guests from happy hour onwards and the rooms were fine. Most tours pick up out the front, or across the road at the Marriott.There is a tour desk including Expedia and a few other companies. The Expedia guy, David,was awesome - Full of good advice and character.The staff at Aston were helpful and friendly - In particular Kalehua at the front desk. We spent the first night in a room which overlooked a roof and another building with 2 double beds - We weren't worried about the view but the room seemed a little dim. I slept terribly that night trying to share a small double bed with my very tall husband. in the morning we requested if we could have the beds pushed together but Kalehua did one better and offered to move us to a better room with a king bed which had a partial ocean view. The room was a lot lighter and felt more spacious- We overlooked the pool and could see the beach to the left. We encountered Kalehua's hospitality and lovely genuine smile a few more times during our stay and each time she went above and beyond where possible to meet our requests.The rooms, as most hotels in Hawaii, are expensive and a little out-dated. I had to keep tying our shower curtain up as I couldn't stand it touching me as it smelled a little stale but it wasn't a big issue. American hotels seem to love using shower curtains...I also have to say, I understand a resort fee is common across America, but it is ridiculous to not just include this price in the per night rate. It's compulsory, it's not an add-on package you can opt out of, and it only includes basic amenities you receive in any Australian/European/Asian hotel I've ever stayed in. Giving a little card showing what the resort fee includes is almost a laugh.. ie access to filtered water, pool towels, movie hire... These should be a given. The only other negative feedback is regarding the courtesy room. WE had a late flight to LA and checked out at 10am choosing to spend the day at the beach across the road. Kalehua mentioned if we ducked back to see her at 3pm she could try her best to get us into the Courtesy room quickly. We came back just after 3 and another girl served us and rather matter of factly said there was no way we could have it and she couldn't even let us book it so we would just have to keep coming up and seeing her. If your Courtesy rooms aren't able to be booked then maybe consider a showering room at the pool area or putting some showers in the bathrooms at least. Overall we would definitely stay here again. The location is awesome right across from Waikiki Beach, shops and food are close, the rooms are neat and tidy and the price was on par compared to other hotels.","Brisbane, Australia","MelM499</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",31,4.0

The room was spectacular with an excellent view of the sea and the bathroom was very clean. The staff was mostly friendly and did their job efficiently. In the Lobby every day they had water with flavors to cool you on a sunny day. Also in the lobby area they give you a small bag with products like sunblock, creams and many other things and there you can ask for towels and chairs that you can use on the beach. A negative point that disappointed me a lot was that after I checked out, I was no longer allowed to use the bathrooms and since my flight was much later I had to find a bathroom somewhere else.

The main problem was the room. I booked an ocean view room (requested king sized bed) thru Priceline. I called the hotel 2-3 days before my arrival to confirm, which the friendly staff did over the phone. My flight got delayed and after 12+ hours, we finally arrived. The front desk clerk was friendly but she was too occupied with something else. She told me that she was putting us in a room with 2 double sized beds. I told her we wanted/asked for king sized bed. She said “OK, I’ll see if I can find you one” then gave me the key cards. I thought everything was good since she never said anything about it after that. We left and went to our room - the keys didn’t work. Left husband watching our suitcases and went back down. By then, it was check-in time and the line was sooo long. Stood in line for a long time, got new keys. Went back up, opened the door and was surprised to see 2 double sized beds. Not to mention other in-room issues. Waited for 30 minutes for checkin time to slow down and called front desk. We were told they could save us a room with king sized bed the next day. He said to come down at noon to checkout of our current room, leave our luggage with the valet people, come back to check in again at 3pm. I wasn’t about to do that. What if they didn’t have a room with a king sized bed? Then we would be sleeping on the streets. LOLI wrote a review on Yelp and contacted corporate. Natasha got back with me right away. She jumped right on it. She blocked a room with king sized bed for us for the next day. She kept in touch with us the entire time. The next day, she called us at noon and sent people to help us move to another room. She stayed on top of our other issues as well, which was wonderful. We used to get free tote and other stuff at check in every year but not this year. ??? I’m in the hotel business. I work for the corporate office of the 2nd largest hotel group in the US. We could have stayed at 1 of my company’s hotels with employee discount but husband wanted to keep our tradition. We’ve been staying here since 2007. I’m giving them 4 stars all because of Natasha.

Our first room was on floor 24 and had a view of the ocean and Diamondhead. We were upgraded to an oceanfront room on the 10th floor for our last two nights. Rooms are small and basic, and the faucet dripped and ac wasn’t the best in the second room. Overall, the staff were friendly and helpful, location was great, we were given 2 refillable water bottles and a tote bag upon arrival and got a great deal on a reusable cooler bag with 4 drinks. Pool towels and beach chairs were provided, as well as light snacks poolside twice in the afternoon.Parking is valet only, cost $25/day, and did get backed up at times. There is also a resort fee daily of about $35. This seems to be typical of hotels along Waikiki Beach.This is my second time staying here (previous stay 10 years ago).

The beach is right across the street and the zoo is basically right next door. There are plenty of shops and places to eat all around. Starbucks and Jamba Juice are right there and open up very early. I had my fill of coffee each morning at 5:30am at Starbucks.We stayed in the Premium Ocean View room on the top (25th) floor. The view was amazing and from our balcony (lanai) we could see the entire beach and all the surfers out in the water. The sunset over the ocean was incredible as well.The elevators are weird to say the least and take some getting used to. The floor buttons are outside the elevator. To go to your floor, you have to swipe your keycard then enter the floor number. The screen will then tell you what elevator to enter when it opens. There are no floor buttons inside the elevator.The room was clean but clearly dated. The room felt more like a Motel 6 than a resort. Though it was a ""Premium"" room, it was very, very small. There was barely enough room to walk around with the two double beds. Frankly, for the price I expected better accommodations. We were well stocked with the usual amenities (shampoo, soap, etc) as well as mini-vacation (no microwave though). The room also had a PlayStation and DVD player with free rentals, but we didn't take advantage of it.There are two restaurants in the hotel. One is a grill on the and the other is a Wolfgang Puck Express for a quick eat. There is also a pool with a large area to sit or sun bathe. Being near the beach, the pool seemed little used.The AC in the room worked well, but due to the size of the room we couldn't avoid a direct draft from it. Not a big deal for me, but my wife needed an extra blanket. The beds and pillows were comfortable enough.The staff was always helpful and pleasant. No complaints at all with personnel. We also drove a car, so we had it valeted every night. It cost us $32 per day for valet plus tip. It took about 15 to 20 minutes for them to retrieve my car, but you can call down ahead of time.Overall, I consider the Aston Beach a good place to stay if you want a view and/or a great location. If you want luxury, I'd try somewhere else.","Chicago, Illinois","Butchboy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",57,3.0

Sooo conveniently located! We had a main tower beachfront room with views over the water. Loved sitting on the balcony watching the sunset. Also enjoyed being slightly away from main crowded Waikiki beach. Very nice beach across the road with the ocean pool. I absolutely loved swimming in a calm safe environment. Although this was during beginning of school holiday period it was never crowded. There's a rock wall that you can walk out on, and on the adjacent side of the rock wall a large beach where you can swim in the ocean. This beach has volleyball nets at the back and a beachstall with umbrellas and surfboard hire. We didn't bother having housekeeping come in, but they were present ever day cleaning adjoining rooms, and accommodated our request for fresh towels and emptying bins. Our room was spotless when we arrived, and that's from someone who can be OCD when it comes to cleanliness. Unfortunately, Aussie flights arrive early morning. We arrived about 10:30am, so expect to wait for room. No one at reception suggested they would look after our luggage (see earlier review where bell hop took care of same), so we went off to the Tiki Bar (otherside of pool) where they were happy to accommodate us and our luggage! Liked offer of free beach towels and beach chairs. We were supposed to get free drink bottles (just recalled reading earlier review), but it was not offered when checking in. Great coffee machine in room but need to supply pods of milk. Also it would be nice to have two wine glasses, only supplied with two ordinary glasses. Make sure you choose screw top wine otherwise will have to buy cork screw ($9 from shop downstairs). Wine seemed to be cheaper at this little shop than big brand store next door. A fabulous place for inexpensive healthy breakfast or lunch is Tucker & Bevvy Picnic Foods three doors down. We stayed on 8th floor, and for premium beachfront wouldn't stay lower than this for great views. No problems with traffic noise or music from Tiki Bar. Reminder, lobby on third floor. Liked the efficient card swipe for lifts which eliminated lots of waiting around.

It's towards the end of the Waikiki strip, next to Honolulu Zoo. You're probably aware of hotel tax, there's also a daily resort fee. The hotel does their best to ensure that you feel like you're at least getting your moneys worth for these extra costs. We booked a partial ocean view room, the photo Im inserting is the view from our room! We got a beach bag with two drink bottles (theres water stations to fill these up whenever you want) and some vouchers inside. You are also allowed to hire beach towels and chairs free of charge. The pool area is decent but pool is small compared to some places, but it's never over crowded or fighting for space. They bring around treats like shave ice and frozen fruit for free. In the rooms, there's a coffee machine, coffee, creamer etc. There's soaps, shampoos etc in the bathroom. There's also a PlayStation, a fridge, safe and iron. There's like 50 overpriced ABC stores in Honolulu, so we were glad that there's a little convenience store inside the hotel downstairs because it was cheaper than the ABC stores (we didnt realise we paid $8 for a loaf of bread from the ABC store lol). There's also two restaurants, jamba juice, subway and starbucks downstairs. This is a really family friendly hotel, in a great location across the road from the sea walled area of the beach (safe/easy for kids to swim). Hotels in Waikiki are expensive without the tax and resort fees, we felt that we got our moneys worth with this place! Outside the hotel there's also a bus stop, this is a pickup/drop off location for tour busses, and the trolley busses that take you around Honolulu (we used Waikiki pink line trolley $2pp :) ). And if your tour bus doesn't do this hotel, 5 metres down the road is another hotel which you'll be able to wait at. The only slightly negative thing I have to say is, the housekeeping wasn't that great. Everyday I left a $2/3 tip for ours (was this enough?), the beds were made toilet cleaned, towels changed. But the table was never wiped down, sometimes the coffee wasn't replaced and the carpet wasn't vacuumed. We are pretty clean so this didn't affect us too much but my tips were obviously for nothing. They need to replace or actually clean the fixtures in the bathroom (taps, shower head) because they have staining.

As a general comment on the island, we absolutely loved Hawaii and thought it was stunning. For the duration of our stay on Oahu we stayed in the Aston Waikiki Beach hotel. Overall we did have a very positive experience with the hotel, below are some Positives and “Negatives” from our stay. Now while I say “Negative” please note that these did not bother us much at all, but they may be an issue for others, as I said we had a very positive experience.Positive:- Location: Perfect Location, right on Waikiki Beach front. Only a short walk to most things in Waikiki- Views: We had an ocean view room and our view of the beach and ocean was absolutely stunning.- Service: Our experience with all the maids, customer service and other staff within the hotel was great do not have a bad thing to say.- Room State: Clean and tidy room, everything was clearly clean and neat.Negative:- Hotel looked and felt on the older side. Carpet and walls etc. had the appearance of being older and a more used condition.- Room Size: Room and Bathroom were on the smaller side, possibly the smallest we had while in America, again not a huge problem as we spent most of our time out of the room.- Noise: Room didn’t seem to have amazing noise reduction ability, although most nights it was not a problem at all, one night we were able to very clearly hear the music from the Tiki Bar attached to the hotel until about 11pm (we had our flight the next morning & were on the 14th floor from memory).- A general thing we found a little strange was the showers. This is more of a comment common to basically everywhere we stayed in America. The bathtub shows I find are not exactly the best, can be a little dangerous and they always feel very cramped. Again it’s not really a negative it’s more of a preference thing and it was something we noticed across the board in the USA.A lovely touch for this hotel was a little welcome package that we were provided which included a small fan, a couple of water bottles and a beach bag. We thought this was a fantastic idea and it added very nicely to the hotel. Overall again we were very happy with this hotel, the service was great, the location was absolutely fantastic and only a few downsides if we were to be VERY picky. We found the hotel great, especially for families with it being close to the beach as well as having its own pool it seemed like a great hotel for people from all walks of life.","Perth, Australia","Mossy911</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",22,4.0

There is also a shuttle that stops off in front of the hotel that is cheap and takes you over Waikiki so you can see more of the island. Yes there is a beach by the hotel but it gets very crowded. So the room and all facilities were great so no complaints there. However when we booked we paid a deposit (like normal) then when we arrived we paid for the duration of the stay at the beginning and my partner and I paid cash and our friends paid on their card. Half way through our stay our friends realised that the hotel had put another hold for the same amount they originally paid and because that was all their money gone we went to the front desk and they managed to help us out since half the bill was paid cash they gave us that back and just charged the card for the full amount. So we thought it was all sorted. Once my friends went home (to Canada) about a week later they had another hold on their card - meaning that the hotel had charged them three times!! They had to call multiple times to even get some answers and at one point someone said we owed another $400 - which we didn’t. Luckily my friends bank was able to release the hold and they got their money back.

First off this is a light and bright hotel and we received a nice welcome. Porters very helpful in receiving and handling our luggage. The reception is on the 3rd level and you can take an elevator or escalator there. Usual resort fee to add to room cost but encountered this at most of the US hotels we stayed. We had a partial ocean view room on the 21st floor which provided a very good view of the beach and ocean as well as Diamond Head crater. We could choose a smaller room with larger lanai or a larger room with smaller lanai. We elected for the latter. Wi-Fi was included and signal and service excellent all the time we were there. No mini bar but small fridge included which was fine as we just bought our own stuff at plentiful stores nearby. Room was relatively spacious and clean. Rooms maybe a tad dated (particularly bathroom) but comfortable enough with good AC. Probably could be made a bit more comfortable with a small lounge seat but that is minor. Seems to be popular with families and we did have some noisy children as neighbours for awhile. The very nice Tiki grill and bar is located on the 3rd floor but be aware it isn’t connected ed to Hotel so you can’t charge dining to your room. There is no room service available. Free DVD and PS3 game rental ( a PS3 in each room) included with three dispensing machines in the lobby. Nice little supplies shop in the hotel as well. Tours depart from outside the hotel or a couple of hundred metres away at the Marriott. Location is really good- just across from Waikiki Beach. There is a small pool available but it was always full of kids and the ocean is over the road anyway. Just be aware this is what I would class as a good quality mid-range Hotel- not one of the luxury brands.

I think the odd number rooms face Waikiki and ocean and even rooms face Diamond Head and ocean. The hotel website got changed a few months ago and isn't real clear on what size of lanai the rooms have. To my knowledge this is the way it goes, on the partial ocean view rooms that are 264 sq ft the lanai is full size and can accommodate 2 chairs and a little table. The rooms that are 312 sq ft the lanai is small and can only have 1 chair. I thought the old website explained this better than the new one. Ours was the smaller room with full size lanai. We were right above the pool and didn't have any problems with noise. The AC was just barely adequate but my wife gets cold easy so she thought it was great. The room was nice and clean and the bed comfortable. Even though the room is small it was fine as we unloaded part of our suitcases in the dresser and stored them in the closet. The rest we put on the luggage rack. When we first went up to the room I noticed that the refrigerator was empty so I called down to the front desk to see about getting it filled but found out that some rooms get it stocked and some rooms don't. The WIFI was free and we had a good signal. I know others have said they had to pay for their WIFI but we didn't. Maybe that was the trade-off for not having a stocked frig? We are not needy guests and only had the room cleaned once in out 7 night stay because we put out the ""do not disturb"" on the door. We would just see the person cleaning other rooms and get fresh wash cloths from them. One curious thing was the first day there was only 1 wash cloth so we got more from the cleaners but the day we had it cleaned they only put 1 wash cloth again. This was a room with 2 beds that can accommodate 4 adults. No big problem, just stopped a cleaning person and got more. Didn't eat at TIKI's, went there to eat breakfast and found they only have a few pastries and fruit for $15 so went to Wolfgang Puck's and it was fine. My wife went to Jamba Juice and got 2 smoothies, which she really enjoyed. Didn't use the pool since the ocean and beach is right across the street. Got beach chairs and towels twice and had no problems. The hotel staff were courteous and helpful. Most everything is within walking distance. We went on a few tours and they picked us up either at our hotel or the Marriot across the street. There is a problem with homeless people in the area. They didn't cause any major problems and there was police in the area most of the time.

Our room was an ocean view (as booked) on a higher floor, and had a nice balcony that we could stand on to watch the beautiful sunset. We had booked directly through the hotel's website and were informed of the extra resort charges that would be collected during our stay. The resort fee includes use of towels for the pool & beach, folding chairs for the beach, DVD/Game rental, Wifi, coffee maker, etc. If this is shocking to you, get used to it - many (if not all) Honolulu hotels charge a daily ""resort fee"" of some kind, you can't escape it. Staff is very friendly and willing to help with any questions you may have. The cleaning staff members are very courteous. The pool was well-maintained. The on-site restaurant Tiki's was great, the food and drinks are good and there is usually live music to enjoy starting in the afternoon - great Happy Hour food and drink specials. A pristine beach is right across the street, and we found the location to be a bit quieter and less congested than further down the road. Shopping is endless - plenty of ABC stores for conveniences and souvenirs, and gift stores abound. It's a short walk to the ""busier"" end of Honolulu, where there is more high-end shopping. Travel desks with information on tours are available on the main floor of the hotel. Our room was a tiny bit dated, but nothing that would turn me off to the place. It was very clean.

The view was good, if you can get a view directly above the pool then you’ll not only have a view of the pool but a better view of Waikiki beach. Our room was small, one luggage rack (like all hotels) but nowhere to put luggage for 4 people in a room. We had a 10yr old & a 4yr old, I would hate to think if there were teenage kids or worse 4 adults in this room. Our air conditioner kept cutting off after about 45 mins. It works on a sensor, so if it stops sensing movement it turns off. Very inconvenient for during the night, our room was pretty stuffy so when one of us would get up because of the heat we would turn it on, it would cool enough for us to get back to sleep, then the same thing would happen again. I was told by the front desk that the sensor function could be over ridden however we had 2 different maintenance staff come to our room, one said the fan needed to be replaced, the next guy said there is nothing wrong with it. I mentioned it again to front desk and nothing happened, and again upon checkout, nothing said other than I’ll pass your comments onto our maintenance team, still charged me for resort tax, and nothing done to compensate our discomfort. The room however is nice and clean and no sign of bed bugs like a lot of previous people have posted. Staff are lovely and polite (other than nothing being done to rectify our situation, & language barrier with maintenance staff though). Pool area is lovely, ordered some drinks from Tiki’s bar however didn’t eat here so cannot comment on the food. We were on the 14th floor so we couldn’t here the music playing each night from Tiki’s but the street noise was absolutely terrible.

Our room was on floor 24 and was the smallest of all we stayed in.

Also, the ac in our room never kept us cool enough. My husband made fun of me for buying a small travel box fan and bringing it with me, but we would have been very uncomfortable at night if it didn’t. Overall a good stay.

I went to the hotel page we check for any military specials . They say that $25 dollars and taxes would be waived if you make a reservation with Waikiki Aston Hotel .

The employee told me that the amount would be waived after you check in and show an active duty Id . I ask her clearly if it make a different do the reservation on the phone or online from the actual hotel Webside . Her response was No is the same thing . We get to the hotel and GUESS what ? They told my husband that to be waive the reservation have to be staying more that two days . I check the Webside again and in the Military appreciation program doesn’t say anything about how many days you have to stay in the hotel for you to get the discount . I try to talk to the front desk and explain to me where is it say in the Webside that I have to stay more that one night . Her respond is that I made the reservation wrong because they have 5 different kind of military programs . Well I guess I work for the Waikiki Aston hotel because all I did is made the reservation on their Webside follow the instructions and I was told that as longer you show your ID the amount would be waived . Because I don’t work for this company and I guess I don’t know how to make a reservation with the military appreciation program never got waveid the amount that was told it will . Anyways I would never stay in this hotel again . I know is just a discount but at the same time if I call and verify I going to want my discount . The personnel of the hotel have no integrity . We talk two employees and they give my husband a different excuse that they give me as longer we didn’t get the amount waived. We do stay vacation all around Waikiki .

We brought our own Garmin - I like to preprogram stops so that instead of relying on phone we just punch in place and go. The 20 mile trip took about an hour. We pulled in Valet parking ( there is public parking but after fighting traffic we thought go with flow) The Valet were very courteous and we were told to take the elevator to 2 where we would sign in. Unfortunately we got on wrong elevator and ended up at 12. Without a pass card, it is impossible to use elevator. We finally got on and went to check in. The check in was good, the lady tried to get us above 10th floor for view of beach.

I didn't know that you could have a conversation with the F-Word every other word. They finally settled down and we got back to sleep.We should have called them we got up every 15 minutes so they could enjoy their interupted sleep. Next day they were gone so that was done.The hotel has lots of options to eat and what we saw was good.

At 4.30 we came back, only to find a queue of around 150 people. It went from the desks across the lobby, lifts etc, around the corner down past the 3 tour areas all the way to the bar. One person bravely went to the front desk in front of the queue (as advised when we all checked in in the morning) only to be told - no you have to queue to get your room key! There were 4 desk operators and the manager did not have the sense to open one of these for people who had already checked in that morning. The queue would have dropped by half if that had been done. We queued for nearly 1.5 hours to get our room key.The other lovely trick this place does is applies a resort fee if you have been booked in as part of a package holiday deal. $26US per day and it is non negotiable. So if you dont want to use their beach towels, internet or dreadful coffee you still have to pay for it. One of our friends booked the hotel through booking.com and did not have this big financial penalty applied.So BEWARE of this hotel or at least be warned as to what to expect.

As a result, we had originally booked at The Mariott down the street but in the end, decided to save a few bucks and booked the Aston after all. We knew what we were getting into and honestly, mostly the location earned this hotel a 3 star rating. It is directly across the street from the beach. For simplicity sake, here is my Pro's and Cons list:Pros:1. Across the street from beach2. comfortable beds3. Easy check in4. Magnified mirror in bathroom (important to ladies)5. Hawaiian Tropic bathroom products - good quality6. Heated pool but small7. Beautiful Ocean View (we were on the 25th floor)Cons:1. Totally outdated - bathrooms need a complete over haul!2. Sun doesn't hit the pool deck until at least after 12 noon.3. Beach chairs are regular lawn chairs - NOT the low kind4. Extremely noisy on the pool deck - from the busy street just below - trolley's dinging, horns blowing, loud bus engines, motorcycles, and.....loud children in the pool. It wasn't relaxing at all.5. Very noisy in the room as well when you open your patio door - street noise is very loudSo, as you can see, it does has some good points. But, your budget and level of need for luxury will help make your decision. This is not luxurious but you can save a few bucks.

After looking at photos posted by other travelers, we knew what we were getting into and all we wanted was oceanfront room. So, you get what you pay for. We paid around $450 per room for 2 nights including taxes and $25/night amenities. We didn't have a car so no parking fee. We checked in other big name hotels, oceanfront was around $300/night.The location is really good because it is towards the end of the strip and when you get oceanfront room, you get to see all the hotels on the strip, it's a great view. There are over 20 floors and we liked the fact that we were not that higher up. Honolulu zoo is 5mins walk. The beach is 3mins walk. Starbucks is located next to ABC stores which is part of the same hotel building. Tiki bar and grill and Wolfgang puck are also in the same building. Lots of options for breakfast /lunch /dinner. Food prices are pretty high ($11- $15) unless you want to eat cheap , there is McDonald's very close. OMG, Mexican restaurant, 5-7mins walk is really good and their food prices are $9-$15 - not bad for a very filling meal.Aston waikiki has its own store (mini version of ABC store) - they have snacks, small meals, water bottles, energy drinks, souvenirs, hats, sunglasses, plastic leis. The hotel gives a card to you when you check in, it's for free DVD rental - looks like Redbox. The people checking in are not too friendly but don't let that spoil your vacation - they need more training especially for a tourist destination!! Overall, great hotel if you don't care for the fact that it's dated - atleast it doesn't smell like old room. Go for oceanfront and you will enjoy your vacation.

I was greeted by a staff member named Sean who worked out that I was on my trip solo, and celebrating my birthday...alone. He said ""not celebrating with friends!?"" I replied ""no"". He then said, ""i'll be your friend, if you pay for all my dinners and drinks"". I was absolutely HORRIFIED! This is how I was welcomed after a 17 hour trip and long flights?To make things worst, I was told the room would be ready in half an hour, which I was extremely grateful for. I waited by the pool at a table, no one suggested where else to wait, and no one came to get me to advise my room was ready, so I checked back after half an hour to be told to continue waiting it would be ready in 5 mins,,,after 10 mins I still continued to wait, and be told it would be ready soon. Not a good start.When I arrived in my room, the balcony was big enough for a small person to just stand on, the bathroom scungy and small and worst of all, I could hear some loud ac or fan unit outside.The next day, I had to go say something to reception, a lovely lady listened apologised and spent the time to find a quieter room for me. Which was greatly appreciated. However, they could only offer a phone call for management to apologize about how I was greeted to by Sean...I thought, was was the point in that? And unfortunately, I could still hear toilets flush, which are extremely loud by the way, like plane toilets. Must have paper thin walls? I also had to request tea and an electric jug as one was not provided, no real milk is provided for tea and coffee...the iron leaked water on and into the iron and seemed un safe to use, and also when I turned the hair dryer on, it sparked and smelled like burning then did not work...Another con is the WiFi is not very good, you can only pretty much get a good wifi connection in the hotel room, it struggles by the pool or at the Tiki's bar which is in the same area. I know this is only a 3.5 star hotel, but come on...really? Very over priced for what it is...you pay mid range resort fee's, and you have to pay for bottled water (no complimentary water included). I'll end on a happier note with some positives.PRO's: opposite Waikiki beach, most tours pick up and drop off from this hotel or near it, within walking distance to shops, bars and restaurants. Right next door to LuLu's which is nice for breakfast...free DVD's to rent at reception. I would research other places first before thinking about staying here again...","Perth, Australia","2davinap</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",10,3.0

This is a great hangout! There’s live music, good food or bar bites and the drinks are always flowing!There’s also a Wolfgang Puck express restaurant below, or go around the corner towards Kapiolani Park and grab a burger at Lulu’s or maybe a drink at Starbucks.

There were 3 of us in a room, Mom, 5-year-old son, and myself. First the good stuff. The service was great, and the staff was always helpful. Our son was very happy with the welcome gift he received from the hotel, a bucket, and shovel to use at the beach. Clearly, the hotel is family friendly. The hotel also has a couple of restaurants close by that are very good. Wolfgang Puck Express and Tiki's Grill & Bar are two restaurants on site we visited. It was also nice to have several tour desks on site, with knowledgeable people to point us in the right direction for some outstanding adventures. Lastly, it is hard to beat the location, directly across the street from the beach, and just to the side of the zoo, great for our son. On the flip side of things, personally, the room was just a little too small for 3 people. We reserved an ocean view room, but when we arrived at our room, the first view we had was of the hotel across the street and not the ocean. We called the front desk to confirm we were in the right room and in fact we were. In the morning with the daylight, we were able to see the ocean but had to be outside on the lanai, or laying on one of the beds looking diagonally out the window. Certainly not the experience we were expecting based on the pictures and information from the hotel website. For those taller travelers out there, it might be worth noting the shower head is very low in the bathroom, making it difficult to wash my hair. I am a little over 6 feet tall. The rooms are also in need of maintenance. The wood bathroom door was peeling, the metal bathroom fixtures such as the wall mounted mirror had rusted in areas, and there appeared to be mold in some spots on the bathroom walls. I was expecting better quality for the price and location. Lastly, when we booked the hotel, on the hotel website, we were given the option of a few promotional discounts, such as on a snorkel tour, trolly tickets, and shuttle to the airport. Our confirmation said we would receive information on how to redeem our promotional discounts a few days before we were to check in to the hotel. We never did receive the email, and when we asked the front desk about the discounts they claimed they never offered them.All in all, we had a nice stay, but I'll probably look more closely at some other hotel options next time.","Anchorage, Alaska","colinun</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anchorage, Alaska</strong>",8,3.0

We asked concierge to get maintenance up to our room to have a look at our bathroom floor which was always wet (leaking toilet), only to be told it will be fine, don’t worry about it. After a few days our carpet was soaked, and found mould near our bed the size of a baseball. Upon check out, we informed the concierge again of our issue with the room, and showed them the photo. All they replied to me was, “aww that’s no good. Sorry to hear about that. How would you like to pay the room tax of 25 per night, plus tax” on that which is also puzzling. As stated the lobby and halls were clean and tidy, and the room cleaners were always friendly.

I did not inform my wife that we would be staying in such a room and when we checked in to the room, she cried tears of joy. We were celebrating 20 years since we last came to Hawaii and also our 20th Anniversary of my wedding proposal. I can guarantee that Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel is the BEST venue to celebrate your momentous day.Besides the great view, it is in an ideal location. The trolley stop is just in front of the hotel and you are just steps away from the beach. As it is nearer to Diamond Head (and the Honolulu Zoo), an early morning hike from the hotel to the top is easier. Also, good food is readily available (Teddy’s Bigger Burgers, etc.).

Hair on the bathroom floor upon first entering. And this time? The Aston passed with flying colors! Not a single stranger’s hair. Other than that, a decent hotel. Nothing special, although we managed to get rooms with a beach view so our balcony view is lovely. The other side of the hotel probably has a nice view of the park, although we didn’t ask. The room is nothing special - just average for a hotel in this price range. (Although we got a nice off-season deal.) One odd thing, however: there isn’t a chair. There’s a mini-table with a stool, but no actual chair that you could offer to a visitor to your room. Not there’s room for one; the room is not spacious. Oh, trust me, I’ve had smaller rooms. So the room size here is okay, just not spacious. They give out beach towels and beach chairs every day and that’s super convenient. The elevator system is weird - you swipe your room key (so we appreciate the security) and enter the floor you’re going to.

We had a partial ocean view room. You could see the beach from our patio and Diamond Head Crater and the zoo when you walked out into the open hallway. We were in a room at the very end of the hallway, which opens further down (almost like a patio walkway). While the views were amazing, being in this open location had its drawbacks. The door was not air-locked and all you could hear all night was the howling of the wind against our door; we ended up playing music during night to block it out. Also, because of the location of this hotel, nights were never silent due to the hustle outdoors.

Please note we are not fussy and have stayed in many hotels around the world.1. Stayed with baby. Had great difficulty organising a crib as they can ONLY request one. Not confirm2. We had 7 mth old baby and our room was with metres of ice machine that kept waking up the baby when used by other guests.3. Rooms shabby and small with towel rack falling off the wall and paint peeling. Tiles cracked and dirty bath4. Room housekeeping enter without waiting due to no privacy door signs5. No place to have quiet drink apart from Tiki bar which during busy times very hard to get tables. They do not take reservations6. Staff not very helpful and hard to find when needed.7. Pool very small.Positives 1. Opposite beach2. Provide free Dvds3. Good nearby restaurants.Note: Very expensive for a run down hotel.

Some Tips:-House keeping only cleans your room every other day unless you specify that you want it every day. -The rooms all have a mini fridge and keurig coffee maker. Housekeeping replaced our pods regularly, but we also purchased a box from the grocery store -The pool gets sun in the afternoon from about 1:30 pm onwards-The wifi is terrific. Got solid connection everywhere in the hotel-We cabbed from the airport for arond $50 US (including tip), but took the shuttle on the way back. You have to book yourself onto the shuttle downstairs at the luggage area and it was $12/person + tip. -There is a very weird elevator system... you'll see-We used the gym every day and it was never busy. A few pieces of cardio equipment and some free weights mostly. Overall this hotel is average. The only thing taking up to the next level beyond and that I cannot stress enough is that it is in an AMAZING LOCATION. It is literally 5 steps from the beach, right above multiple restaurants (Lulus, Starbucks, Tikis, Subway, Jamba juice, etc) and an ABC store, and right next to the zoo! It is clean and comfortable and all of the employees were courteous and helpful. We wouldn't stay anywhere else. For the price, it cannot be beat! ",,jayandchels,29,4.0

But if you want a well-priced, full-service hotel that’s only a crosswalk away from the sands of Waikiki, this is a good choice. Some photos make it look like it’s ON the beach, so let’s start by dispelling that misconception: south of the Moana Surfrider no Waikiki hotels are directly on beach. Public areas:-Street level driveway loop & lobby w/big comfortable chairs where you can wait for your taxi or shuttle. Bell desk, small gift shop, chain eateries such as Puck Express & Subway. -Check-in desk on the 3rd floor. Access via escalator or elevator.-Tiki’s Grill overlooks the avenue facing the beach w/both open-air and covered tables. Salad was fresh and beautifully presented, though service was very poor for us at lunch. Bar has upbeat live music in the evenings.-Small pool on the 3rd floor terrace wasn’t getting much use. It sits in the shade of the building until afternoon. Lots of available lounge chairs.-Elevators have a quirky security system which may make you feel foolish the first time you use them. Other guests who’ve been there longer are usually on hand to give you an initial training session and it’s easy after that.Rooms:-Website gives you a good description w/photos of the different categories. Our Ocean View Select (20th floor & above) had a fantastic view of the beach & ocean beyond if you just turned your chair a bit to the left.-Amenities include free wi-fi, Keurig coffee brewer, in-room safe, bath products.-Construction materials are pretty basic quality—formica sink countertop, plastic tub enclosure, etc. What you would expect for 3 stars.-The double beds are small, not really suited for 2 people unless they're children.-There's a good amount of street noise in this area. Book a higher floor if you're a light sleeper.Other amenities:Free beach towels and beach chairs",California,"Callejera1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",61,4.0

The location is good, a little removed from the craziness a few blocks away, right on a great part of the beach that's a little less busy. The service we received was also good, but after waiting in way too long of a check in line. Why the low rating - it needs a major update. I have to give below average due to the shower and bathroom tile being reminiscent of a Motel 6 built in 1960 and no effort being done to fix the grout. The bed was comfy enough and we had a room facing the ocean, so the view was nice.

As soon as these are carried out and the if hotel is constantly updated and maintained, this could be one of the best hotels in Waikiki! Beds are super comfy which is a blessing after a long day out exploring. We're pretty self sufficient travellers so don't require much assistance however the interactions we did have with staff were great. The concierge team were fantastic help with our bags, housekeeping were very friendly and the front office staff were fantastic in getting us checked in promptly when they could. This is a high volume hotel so check in can get slammed and lines are long but those on reception maintained efficiency and friendliness. Special mention to Natasha for ensuring our room was as expected and Sean on reception for his advice on how to get our mobile phones on the Hawaii cell network. We did exactly as he suggested and it was perfect! The lift system was great too - saves you time and gets you to your hotel room quicker. The biggest negative we experienced was when it was windy, the wind did whistle in through the balcony door which made for a long night.

Our hotel was designated by the travel agent so of course we had the lowest grade of room which was Standard. I must say that the location of the hotel couldn't have been better. Prime location right across from the beach.The hotel needs a face lift, I have never been to a hotel before where the check in was on the third floor and the ground floor entrance has the appearance of an underground car park.There was nowhere to tell us where to go to sign in, eventually I saw a staff member who told me to go to the third floor.The elevator system was archaic. You had to select the floor you wanted, then wave your room card key in front of a magic eye. The elevator you needed to get into was then flashed up, either A,B,C or D. A very strange system.Our room was on the 5 th floor at the very back of the building which ended on an outdoor corridor which resembled flats I have seen on television programmes. I must say I was very disappointed, particularly with the balcony and the sea view which you could barely see for the roof tops. We were unable to use the balcony because if the wind probably because we were on the back corner.The room itself was nice and clean as was the bathroom. Towels and toiletries were replenished daily. The coffee maker was very poor and sometimes the coffee was replenished and sometimes not. Water was charged at 2 dollars a bottle.Until we checked out we were unaware of the spa charge and tax for each day of our stay. This amounted to just over 30 dollars per day. This soon adds quite a bit to your payment, together with water etc.There are lots of shops, restaurants etc in the location but we did not like the restaurant on the ground floor, it looked very cheap and tatty. We had a pizza from there one evening and it was terrible, the worst pizza we have ever had. More or less a crust which had hardly anything on it.As I said in my title.. You get what you pay for.

I was somewhat hesitant about using this hotel based on reviews. However, hotel turned out to be just fine. It is a large, tour based hotel but I found it to be clean and in good condition. It is right on the beach (actually just across the main road) so ocean access is almost immediate.I was assigned a 12th floor, ocean view room with balcony. It was quiet and immaculate. Bed comfortable and room good sized. Absolutely no issues with the room. The only reason not 5 stars is check-in was, well, bring a good book and something to eat. I arrived at 3:45 pm for 3:00 pm check-in. There were 6 people ahead of me and two receptionists. After 20 minutes the line was reduced to two people and me and that is when everything stopped. Both receptionists were engaged in prolonged check-in issues with their customers. One left and did not re-appear. At this point a seriously large number of people showed up. The check-in line was now the entire length of the lobby, past the last elevator and around the back with exhausted travelers becoming more and more disgruntled. Another 10 minutes later two new receptionists showed up and began checking in people. I finally got checked in and given key at 4:20 pm. The line was still enormous, not moving much and growing as I left reception. There were now four receptionists.None of the receptionists seemed very bothered by this and kept their friendly, aloha attitude. Certainly management must know that the day before the cruise their hotel will be filled with pre-cruise passengers (this is the only hotel NCL uses) coming from the airport and arriving within a short time of each other. Failure to have adequate front desk staffing at a high activity time is a management scheduling failure.Of note is the issue regarding accessing the elevators.

We got the room type we paid for (ocean view in the Waikiki side) no free upgrades for honeymoon but we did get the best possible room for the type we paid for (closest to the ocean and highest flooor without paying extra). Oh, and a free picture frame.The room was nice, nothing special but the bathroom needs updates. The facet didn’t shut off when the handle was straight down and the shower and floor just seemed old. Didn’t care though as the view from the room made up for it!!! Also I found it really odd that there was no little patio table for the balcony. The elevator had a bit of an issue a couple times, takes along time sometimes and you have to scan your card before it comes. The location of the hotel was nice, less busy at the end of the strip but extremely walkable still. One negative of the location was the homeless people who seem to congregate in the huts by the beach across from the hotel. There were quite a few bum fights we witnessed and apparently a bit of a meth problem on the island which we were not aware of.All in all it was a great location and nice hotel. If I were to go back I’d probably stay one street back from the beach and save myself $1000. One street back was just as walkable and looks like ocean view would be possible too.Also was surprised there was a per day fee to use the safe.","Oakville, Canada","S_A_E122</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakville, Canada</strong>",17,3.0

Our room while not the biggest, was very clean, and had the most breathtaking views of the beach from our lanai. I loved how all the people that work at the Aston made us feel very welcome.

We were a little concerned when arriving because we had read reviews of the place being outdated. While the reviews were correct, the location of the hotel made up for all the shortfalls - for lack of a better word. Our room was spacious and on the 25th floor. The bathrooms are outdated but were clean. The room meet our needs. The hotel staff worked very hard in keeping the place clean and everyone was super helpful and cheerful. The best feature of this hotel is it's location. It's steps away from the beach. There's also a bunch of restaurants of various price range in the vicinity which adds to the convenience factor. The hotel is also accessible by public transit and is close to Honolulu Zoo and Diamond Head. Our only negative expertise with AWBH was that we were surprised to see a $25/night transaction charge added at checkout - we were under the impression that this would only be a one time charge. We should have done our due diligence when reserving. Another minor nuance was the elevator system. You have to key the floor from outside before you enter - a bit of an odd system but seems to work - this did add to the wait times especially during rush periods. Overall our experience at AWBH was very pleasant and the hotel met all our needs and then some. Factor in the room rates and it'll be hard to find a better location in Waikiki. If you are a stickler about room appearances then stay at the Marriott across the street - but be willing to open your wallet.

At check-in there was a woman handing out cups of shave ice to everyone waiting, which was nice. We got to our room and set the thermostat to 70° before going out. 3 hours later we came back to the room and it was still 74°, which to us is uncomfortable. I spoke to the desk and they were extremely helpful and sent a maintenance tech to the room. About 40 minutes later the temperature hadn't changed, so the desk moved us to a better room. As far as the rooms go, our rooms were clean. You can find places in the rooms that need to be touched up but I'd be willing to bet that you can find the same thing at one of the higher priced hotels down the strip. Housekeeping did a great too.At checkout you'll be charged a $25/night amenity fee and $32/day valet parking fee (if you used valet). Parking in Waikiki is a premium and the $32 is pretty much what you'll find at any Waikiki hotel. If you don't want to pay that, just take the bus because you won't find any street parking. The $25/night amenity fee covers multiple things the only one we really used was the WiFi. Personally, I'd rather the amenity fee be added to my room total on the front side so it's already paid when we arrive. But it's ok, just make sure you budget for that. If you're going to be driving, the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel is at the end of the strip, so getting in and out is pretty easy. If you've ever walked by any of the other hotels on Kalakaua, you know that getting in, and especially getting out, are difficult.The hotel employees are great, so be kind to them.

When I arrived I wanted to see if our room was ready and was transferred 7 times in less than 4 minutes until I finally asked for a supervisor and they figured out how to check if a room was ready...2) Got to the room, and it was a lot more drab than expected.. One of the yellow pillows was missing a pillowcase. The sheets and towels had stains on them each night even though we requested to have them changed daily.3) Valet is a JOKE. Called from my room 15 minutes in advance, and still had to wait downstairs for another 10 minutes. I could have WALKED to where I needed to be in the 25 minutes it took for them to get my car. Expect to wait 15-20 min each time. When returning the car, expect to wait in your car for 5-10 minutes either on the sidewalk or in the street. Can't even drop off your car because the cars in front aren't being moved.4) Got a knock on the door at 8:30am with NO announcement of who was there, and someone immediately putting the key to get in the room?!? Since when does housekeeping NOT announce they are outside before trying to enter the room?? Luckily had the bolt lock up because I was changing. Housekeeping also left behind a huge can of Lysol on our sink.5) A few days after leaving the hotel, checked my credit card statement and saw an additional $59.69 charge from the hotel. Tried to call to find out where it was from.... only to be transferred another 5 times to the same people, finally transferred to a supervisor, and was only able to leave a voicemail.5 stars for location, 0 stars for service, 0 stars for cleanliness.

Love that a great beach is right across the street and that's it's close to Kapiolani Park. It's location is a little less manic than some other Waikiki locations.This trip we were greeted wonderfully by Helen at the front desk. She took care of our reservation in a way you'd want to be treated by anyone working the front desk of a hotel. EXCELLENT. Honorable mention goes to Chris and to Sean as well who checked us in last July.Having said this, I only gave the hotel 3 stars for a few reasons. For starters, the room furnishings as well as the bathroom fixtures are a little long in the tooth. Some updating is definitely in order. The bath towels are a bit on the coarse side.If you can afford it, I recommend an ocean front room, as the view is definitely million-dollar. A room near the elevators will keep you awake at night and a room off one of the side streets will awaken you way too early with the sounds of beeping delivery trucks backing in.The pool, while small, is decent and the deck area has been nicely updated. Although we didn't visit the restaurant on property this trip (Tiki's) it's a good one and Wolfgang Puck Express down below can be a life saver.I'll be back getting my Aloha on again, soon.","New York City, New York","lvb5th</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",11,3.0

Also each room has a PlayStation u can rent games from the lobby or movies sort of like a redbox kiosk it's included with your resort fee so you don't pay extra. I was bummed that my room was ocean view technically but I had no patio it was a small little area you step out and that's it nothing fit there literally and was actually pretty scary. I had 2 small children with me I just kept it locked just didn't seem safe. The hallway was really loud with wind blowing thru the halls so you could hear it all night wind blowing thru the hall. The reason it does that is because part of each floor has a open section and there is no door it's open so the air move freely thru the halls which made it very loud you could feel the air pressure pushing underneath the door had to put a towel.

It would just keep cooling. This resulted in us freezing in the middle of the night. So we'd have to turn the A/C totally off. Then we'd be hot a couple hours later.

The hotel is a bit dated, the room was very clean, bedding comfortable, everything worked, but you will notice a lot of small things aren't as perfect as a true five star hotel would be. It didn't bother me, as I came for the view. I requested a room on a corner, which offers a little more privacy, as the balconies are rather exposed to other balconies residents looking at you. With a small wait, they were able to fulfill my request at no extra charge. The checkin area of the hotel is in an awkward location, adjacent to the pool, fully exposed to the elements. The staff all around were very friendly and hard working. My hunch is the rooms with ordinary views or no views aren't as good a value as their few ocean front rooms.

Who doesn't say thank you for staying with us upon checkout??- My daughter left her watch in the room and told me where she left it, and I kept thinking she lost it.

There is some street parking if you can find a spot however Hotel has valet parking for $32/ per day with in out privileges. Check-in was good however When I booked the hotel it said a King bed or double bed. I end up getting a King bed and did not feel like going thru the switch. Hotel room had a partial view of the Waikiki beach and the pool. Request higher level as the lower level rooms can get noise from the pool area. Not sure why hotels don't have microwaves in the room but their is a microwave in the pool area and a small mini mart has one too by the lobby that guest can use. Over all my family had a good stay.

I had checked reviews prior to booking but when a ""bargain"" was advertised I jumped at the opportunity. The location is the best thing here at the quieter end of Waikiki opposite the beach. We arrived late from Maui and checked into our room after being ""upgraded"" to a deluxe room on the 9th floor with a good partial ocean view. The room was on the small but the bathroom was tiny with the toilet so low to the ground it almost felt like you were squatting!A few weeks before travelling I checked rates for curiosity and found may bargain rate was now even cheaper. It was a non refundable rate so I decided to contact the live chat to see if I could change my room type given rates were cheaper ; I typed my query and received a very short response saying contact Reservations. I replied with a thank you and expected a mahalo in response to indicate end of live chat - but nothing - very rude. I did email reservations with my details and the same query and received no response at all; once we'd arrived in Hawaii a computer generated response that my request was received etc finally came through but no one actually responded to me personally. This hotel needs lots of work but simple things like provided additional umbrellas around the pool area won't cast much but provide relief from the sun as well as some palms in pots to break up all the hot hard surfaces. We had to sit near the toilets to get shade, the pool towel guy had 1 of the 6 umbrellas available for himself and guests couldn't get shade when needed! The room furniture is all scratched and chipped, the carpet full of dust around skirting boards but beds were very comfy.The position is not enough to book this hotel for the money.","Terrigal, Australia","nothappyjan1507</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Terrigal, Australia</strong>",22,2.0

Visited from July 24 to August 3. Stayed at one of the Ocean Select room. These rooms are the best as they directly overlook the ocean and beach. If it's in your budget, splurge for the Ocena front Select room on the higher floors. Well worth it. (we were on 18th)We were a family of 4 (self, wife and 2 kids(17 and 11 yr old))I'm surprised at some of the negative and specific comments of the other reviewers. We certainly did not experience any of those negative things!Our check in was quick and efficient. The bell boy delivered out bags within 5 mins of checking in.Our room was clean and furnished with everything that was advertised. The view was amazing! The hotel is not spanking brand new and maybe not ""5 star"" , but it certainly is not run down and it is clean and well kept. Never say any bug/insect or anything ever in our room or hotel.We did not experience any bad smells at all (in room or hallways). The Air condition worked well. The hallways and hotel in general was always clean and tidy. The carpets were not worn out. While the 2 beds in the room were not queen size, it was adequate for the 4 of us. and the smaller size beds meant more room to move about in the room.My wife is very picky and did her own ""housekeeping"" and only asked the maid to change the garbage as needed and give us new sheets and towels. The maid was very friendly and always pleasant, smiling and helpful.We rented a car and the guys at the valet parking were friendly and prompt. never a problem or wait. Generally the stall was friendly and helpful.The small restaurant on the ground floor (wolfgang puck express) was convenient, but not the best for dining since lots of beach foot traffic. But they are not part of the hotel. Great for a quick coffee though, and they don't fuss if you wanted several refills.As for the Tiki Grill and Bar- we found that to be excellent! Food was great, the staff was very good. One manager in particular, KYLE was excellent to us and made each visit even more pleasant.While other guest may have individual negative experiences, we certainly did not see the things they complained of. In face speaking to other guest, we got the impression that they were likewise satisfied.The plus about the hotel is the location! This hotel is located in an amazing and convenient spot. Great for the beach; walking to the waikiki hot spots and driving to the highways.Our family has travelled a lot; staying in several 4 and 5 star all inclusive hotels in the Caribbean etc. We have found that what makes your stay even more enjoyable is having a positive, open attitude and not finding fault with every minute thing. Don't complain because a piece of paint is peeling on a small spot on a door or wall! Relax, you are on vacation.Lastly, we want to give a great big thankss to NATASHA AKEE. We arranged our stay through her. She met us a couple of times during our stay and made sure everything was to out satisfaction. Very personable and friendly service.

(Supposed to get an ocean/Diamond Head view and we were on the opposite side of the hotel looking into the hotel across the street and only on the 9th floor.) The dresser looked like it had been in a loosing fight with a dog. The bathroom was less than impressive and looked like my parent's back home. I was in tears so my husband went down to talk to the employees. They did give us a higher room with a view of what they told us we were getting. (Unfortunately it was overlooking the other neighboring hotel and all we could hear was the air-conditioning unit.) The bathroom was still the same, disappointing one as downstairs. There was a room safe, but you had to pay to use it. They had valet parking that we understood to be $32 for the week, but when we checked out it was $32 a day. There was water in the room, but you had to pay for that too. There was a pool and towels, but it was all charged in an amenity fee at the end of the week.

Cleaning of the room was haphazard to say the least. Some days the tissues/toilet rolls and shampoos etc were replaced and some days they wern't. The cleaners didn't seem to do a very good job either.Staff were very matter of fact - not at all friendly or helpful.The Wolfgang Puck quick service restaurant on the ground floor was a disgrace. I realise that it is probably independantly owned and operated, but the food was inedible and the restaurant and staff grubby and the hotel I am sure would not want to be associated with such a disgraceful operation.The Tiki restaurant on floor 3 is almost as bad. The food was pretty poor and the service even worse. They managed to get 1 out of 2 drinks wrong and then served the 2nd in a glass with a bug of some sort floating around in it.

We had stayed here in 2008 and the rooms were much nicer then (at least the one we stayed in).View - What they gave us was a full ocean view - just on a lower floor so some palm trees were covering the view. Still great to see. The only down side was that we were on the roof level and you could see lots of items discarded from rooms on the roof top. Towels, hats, shirts, trash. Not the greatest view.Check-in - quick and easy. I'm glad that we arrived before 3pm - when we went back down to the lobby after 3pm the line up was about 50 people long.Room - overall, it was adequate. The furniture was a little tired but the bed was comfortable. The more irritating part was that there is a restaurant in the lower levels of the hotel and you could smell it in the room 24/7. It wasn't the best small (though not foul) but very greasy, and a smell that just wouldn't leave. Also the air condition didn't seem to work that well - it was always on but the room didn't seem to cool much.Bathroom - the bathroom was definitely lacking and tired. It definitely needs a refresh - the hand rail had been repaired many times to stay attached to the wall and you should see the patchwork etc.Pool/ocean - we didn't use the pool at all, but the access to the ocean is great.

This way we all go to sleep together and all get up together. Otherwise we run the risk of the kids getting on a different schedule and watching too much TV or playing on their phones too often. Many of the name brand hotels in Waikiki could not offer us a big enough room for the 4 of us (with 3 beds) but the Aston had a very large room and a great price. There were 2 double beds and a pull-out sofa and plenty of space. The housekeeping crew was fantastic providing extra towels and amenities once they saw that there were 4 of us in the room. The location is perfect at the far end of all the hotels - still walking distance from larger hotels and the expensive shops, but far enough away to be more quiet.The hotel is also a short walk from a grocery store, the aquarium and the zoo. While the beach in front of the hotel is not ideal, it is nice enough and you can always walk to any beach that you want as there are no private beaches.The hotel also provides towels and even beach chairs free of charge.

Unfortunately, the pool was only open until 9:00 and evenings would often find people giving their kids swimming lessons in the pool.

The hotel had rules for the pool (no jumping or diving) but they were enforced like a UN resolution (""stop or we'll tell you to stop again"").None of this is really the hotel's fault, it's actually mine for expecting that people in 2017 would recognize that other people exist and act accordingly.

We stayed on the 15th floor with a partial ocean view room. It may a small well have been full ocean view as we had a beautiful view of Waikiki beach. Check I now took longer than usual but worth it a short the room was spectacular. I enjoyed my morning coffee on the balcony every morning before most of Waikiki woke up. The Keurig machine worked great and it was replenished daily like clockwork for us. Even when I only use Sec new sugar from the packet, the room attendant added another packet so I wouldn't run out. What really stood out is in the day we checked out, although they didn't clean our room, they restocked our coffee whichever was much appreciated. Not knowing they would come in, I had my electronics laying out, an envelope with a significant amount of cash laying out. Nothing was touched! I am truly amazed by the professionalism and friendliness of the staff Fromm the check in staff, to the wonderful pool attendants, to the room attendants, to the valet Parkers. There was one security guard who patrolled the pool constantly who was a bit of a stickler and didn't allow jumping onto the pool, I read the rules posted by the pool and had my kids (5,7 years old read them). However nowhere did it state no jumping in the pool. As you can imagine, it's quite difficult to explain to young children why this isn't allowed. What is even harder is that newcomers to the pool would inevitably jump in, prompting my kids to ask why those people (adults and kids both) were allowed to do so. From my days lounging by the pool, this one guard was the only one who reinforced that ""rule"", no one else did. So if he wasn't around, the no jumping ""rule"" was never reinforced which to a 5 and 7 year old is unexplainable. There were written rules of no outside food allowed which wasn't reinforced, no floats in the pool was half reinforced as some kids had arm floating which were allowed but larger donut floats were not. All in all, no big deal except for that one security guard who's name I could never seem to catch. If you are asking why We spent so much time at the pool, it's because during two days, Waikiki beach has jellyfish and my kids go to stung and refused to go back for a few days.The beds were comfortable and the elevator system was smart and you have to use your room key card to Push your floor number before a specific elevator was assigned to you. This helped min crowding in the elevators and helped them run faster. This hotel is located toward the end of Waikiki beach whichever isn't a big deal since the entire strip is so walkable. Lots of shops and restaurants nearby. Wonderful hotel and we would definitely return.","Sterling, Virginia","lylykwok</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sterling, Virginia</strong>",19,4.0

The check in process was fairly painless and took approximately 30 minutes (we arrived roughly around 5pm). When we checked into the room, the first thing we noticed was obviously the beautiful view. It was absolutely gorgeous!! Upon first walkthrough, we did find an empty wine bottle behind the curtains. We also thought the bathroom was dirty/dingy, but after a closer look, it just appeared that way because the tiles were stained and a few were cracked; it was actually clean. The commode did leak water from around the base slightly, which was unfortunate. The shower head, when pushed as high as it would go, still was only high enough for a 5'7"" person or shorter to comfortably take a shower. I was crouching down to wash my hair and am 5'9"". There was one night when the hallway lights quit working completely on our floor, but after calling the front desk, they were back on by the next morning.The room and bathroom walls did have several coats of paint on it, without the previous coats being removed and was very obviously noticeable. There was minimal rust on the metal fixtures in the bathroom.We also had an issue where another guest who was staying one floor down and one room over was smoking weed on his lanai. We went inside our room from the lanai and shut our lanai door because we didn't care for the smell, and realized the door did not seal and we could quite distinctly smell the odor. We had previously recognized this to a degree because you can hear street traffic and people with the door shut at night. The valet services were generally okay and our vehicle would be brought up within 10-15 minutes of calling. However, on three occasions we called the valet station with no answer (common problem it seemed when calling anywhere except the hotel operator). There was one instance where we did call down and requested our vehicle be brought up, we came down twenty minutes later and the vehicle had not been brought up. We waited an additional 10-15 minutes before our vehicle was brought up. There was one older gentlemen who worked the valet station (later morning/early afternoon), who was particularly grumpy and unfriendly but he seemed to be an isolated case.All in all, the staff was friendly. The housekeeping staff was especially friendly and courteous; they greeted us every time they saw us or passed by us, and also kept the room very clean. The mattress in the room was exceptionally comfortable and we slept like babies most nights.We did have several packages shipped to the hotel during our stay (flowers x2, a gift basket, chocolates, etc) and they all were waiting at the front desk for us and a message left on our phone to come pick them up. We also were not sure what snacks and drinks in the room we could eat and drink, and what we would be charged for.The hotel overall is an average three star hotel; nothing glamorous or overwhelming about it. Its redeeming qualities are its location and views. It is debatable on whether it was worth what we paid for it, but bed was super comfortable and let's be honest... who is in their room that much in Hawaii. We certainly were not.","Aiea, Hawaii","br11183</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aiea, Hawaii</strong>",4,3.0

First time was with family during our family vacation and second time was for business. Here's what I think...- Although very courteous, valet could've offered assistance with my luggage. I was traveling alone with luggage for the week.- Next to a sewer so smell can be intense at times.- Check-in line was long and on the 3rd floor...seems they could've/should've had enough staff to accommodate all the guests that they knew were coming in for the day. - obviously, its hot in Hawaii so waiting in line outdoors to check-in, after a long flight, is quite exhausting. - The front desk staff were all very friendly. Stella helped and once I got to her, check-in was a breeze. - got to my room and it was a bit stuffy. I made sure the AC was on and it took a while to feel comfortable but it was fine in the end...- Albeit this facility is located right on Kalakaua, each front, I wouldn't stay there again for business but it would be great for someone vacationing with family for the first time. - Bathroom had a tub and toilet; outdated but useful. - I didn't find my room had enough plugs for all my computer cords, etc.- I found it a challenge to iron my clothes without a nearby plug.- They no longer serve breakfast in the AM. They supply you with a reusable welcome bag with sunblock, lip balm and playing cards. - Great sunsets if you have a room with a partial or full ocean view. I caught some great pictures! Bottom line: Since I had to stay in my room longer than I would've liked to tend to business, the lackluster room was closing in on me. Outdated rooms are ok if you're just sleeping and using the bathroom but not ok for a work trip when you're prepping for meetings, etc. The staff there are all wonderful I'd say and they do give off that Aloha vibe. Just comparing differences to what I'm use to, I suppose. Great bang for your buck, though. Mahalo, Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel, but I won't be back.

There is a pretty good and relatively inexpensive restaurant by the pool that is not part of the hotel.

There are beach towels available at times but my experience is they were usually out of them and passing out bath towels. Not a big problem but could be easily remedied. It is across the street from the beach park with the sea wall;we used the beach several other places. Waikiki is not the best or cleanest beach on Oahu but there is lots of fun stuff to do and eat here, it is steps from the street and you can rent surf boards and boggy boards by the hour.The beach is public and the more expensive hotels are on the beaches with waves, you can use the beach anywhere you want. The Aston location is at the Diamond Head end, so not as crazy as some others and the price is about half of what we paid for beach front elsewhere, If you have not been to Hawaii before be advised that the room charge is where it starts, added is Amenity fees, resort fees, parking, tax and that's the price of rice in China.All things considered this is a very good value for the area.

Positives: rooms look the same (still nice furniture and decor, bathrooms are a little small), partial ocean views still have a decent view of the ocean. Amenities are Hawaiian Tropic and they also gave us a cooler bag of great Coola samples. We only stayed one night this time, but would definitely return again.

Housekeeping did a wonderful job each day even with our constant accumulation of ""stuff"" and responded promptly when we had an issue with our blow dryer. The room had tons of space for us to spread out and relax. My family really liked being able to swim in the pool and then rent a video game or movie on the way back to the room.

When we arrived there was only one balcony chair so I called housekeeping, who rectified the issue within minutes. Everyone who works at the hotel was really friendly and lovely (except for one surly guy at the valet bell desk!) and we felt really safe and secure in our room. The hotel is a block from Honolulu zoo, so sort of other end of the hotel strip from royal Hawaiian village, outrigger etc, but we actually loved the location as it was a few blocks away from the madness and frenzied busy-ness but still close enough to stroll down there for shopping/restaurants. (Check out aloha burrito at 307? Lewers st - next door to moose mcgillicutty - fantastic giant burritos all $8 usd - sigh - I miss those!). Waikiki trolley pink line stops at the hotel - you can get on there and pay $2 per trip, which goes to ala Moana shopping centre - sometimes when it was super hit we would get off a couple of stops down if we were feeling lazy.The free DVDs are awesome - our playstTion didn't work so we called concierge who were in our room within minutes and had fixed the issue.Keurig coffee pods delicious coffee gets replenished daily - you can buy milk if you need from one of the many abc shops in the block, or I think they had packet creamer. There is also a handy little shop near the room lifts for items such as water (99c for 1.5 litre), drinks, snacks, ice cream etc.Wolfgang puck express is downstairs in the complex - make sure that you try a pizza if you like them - I had a breakfast pizza and I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed this - a highlight of my meals in Hawaii! The base was like a buttery and crunchy Turkish bread - delicious!We went to the pool a couple of times but the issue with it is most of the time the pool is in full hot beating down sun, so it was actually too hot to get in For risk of my fair skin burning - wished I had taken my rash vest. The beach is across the road and there are plenty of beautiful tall palm trees there to provide some shade.Fresh towels were available - just needed to sign them out and sign back in and you counsel use at the pool or the beach.I was there from 3 to 17 may and I Am already depressed as I miss it so much. Rooms themselves were not luxurious but they were clean, tidy and well maintained - beds and pillows were comfy - I loved my time at the Aston Waikiki beach hotel and hope to return in the future ","Ballarat, Australia","511vicp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ballarat, Australia</strong>",10,5.0

Location was the best part of this property. it's at the end of Waikiki beach, a quarter mile from the ""Duke"" statue. the beach out front is wonderful, with a protected swimming area. The red and pink ""hop on/hop off"" buses stops right in front of the hotel. The zoo is in walking distance, as are many restaurants and shops across from Waikiki beach. The hotel is in need of much work, and the rooms are small and dark. The bathroom in our room was in need of remodeling. we were in 1502, with an outside entry into our room. the lanai is small with one chair. the view of the beach is ok, with the Marriott blocking the view towards the west. we could see diamond head to the east very clearly. the room had a king sized bed, a tv, 2 small nightstands, and 2 small wood chairs with very narrow chairs. i would rate this room below expectations, and i was disappointed with the quality of room provided.other comments: the elevators are confusing at first. No instruction was provided, and i had to return to checkin to figure it out. they were actually pretty prompt, but you had to stop at level 3 to go to your room. it was a bit odd, but i'm sure it was for safety, so i'm ok with it. Pool was ok, and water was cold, which was a surprise. Hotel has a bar/restaurant called the Tiki's bar and grill . very nice bar and very good food. I'll review separately.one word of advice - they charge a deposit on the key. when we departed, we turned in the key, but the deposit was not returned. seems kind of cheap and underhanded, to keep our deposit.","Columbus, Indiana","drs1041</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Indiana</strong>",32,3.0

But, to be fair, 90% of Waikiki is dated;) We just got home today from staying a wonderful 10 nights at the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel. This place is a great location, right across from the beach, and the last hotel on the Waikiki strip. Everyone working there was very friendly, and helpful. Being that we arrived at 9:30pm, and departed at 8:30pm we had zero issues checking in, or out. Our room on the 7th floor had a partial ocean view, and partial view of Diamond Head. The room was about 250-300 sqr feet. Had everything a hotel room usually has, and noise was not an issue on the 7th floor. And by the way, if you need a hair dryer, it's in the closet, in a black bag that says hair dryer (girlfriend found that out on our last day lol)Hotel had full, very strong wi-fi all over the place (but to be honest, you are in Hawaii, and shouldn't be on it;) )The resort fee was $25 usd per day, a bit of a bummer, but I couldn't find a hotel in Waikiki that wasn't charging one. And $25 was on the lower end for the area. Parking was $32 usd a day, again high, but typical for the area. A valet will park your car for you, as space is very limited this is not an option, they will park it for you. And pretty much all the ""cheap"" or ""free"" parking no longer exists as Waikiki has grown a bit over the last few years.Bottom line, if you want a solid, economic, helpful, and reliable hotel, this is a great pick. And hey, you are in Hawaii, you shouldn't be in your room that long anyway:)Oh, and as far as the elevators go (as this has come up in past reviews) they are super simple. Hit your floor number, scan room key, and an elevator is automatically assigned to you. The hotel is a busy place, don't expect the elevator to just ""show up"" immediately;)Hope this helps.And thank you to the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel for such a fantastic addition to our holiday.",,alecfab,2,5.0

Other than this everything was perfect.I had been charging my camera and left this by the plug socket to remind me to charge the spare battery ahead of our snorkelling and Shark dive. But after returning to the room in the evening the camera was missing. I turned the room upside down thinking at first I had misplaced this but can now be assured this was NOT the case.

This was over a week ago and I am yet to receive a response.I have also emailed but also waiting for a response.As a result of this theft I was unable to record and take photos at various snorkelling sites and have had to spend more on photos and camera hire since.

TV has plenty of channels. Bathroom is older and desperately needs a renovation. First, we had a long black hair in tub upon check-in YUCK.

If this is a compulsory fee, why is it not just included in the price of the room in the first place? $25 (excluding tax) is extremely expensive just to maybe use a beach towel and a chair for a few hours a day. Despite these little details, our stay there was very pleasant. The Tiki Bar and Grill down stairs is great. The vibe there is great and also the location is excellent.",,Jeffrey Y,0,3.0

When it arrived it was simply shoved in the room and made it impossible to move in the room.

Went to Pearl harbor and returned to the Aston at 3. There were a number of people in the registration line so we decided to have a late lunch at their captive restaurant and wait for the line to go down. I came back a half hour later and the line was the same. Came back at 3:50 and spent 25 minutes in line. There were only 4, sometimes 3 registration clerks available. Processing time was long for many people. We spent 25 minutes in line before reaching the counter. By this time the line behind us was half again as long as when we got in line. I guess they don't care. This is queuing theory plain and simple. Wait time depends on three things: how fast customers arrive, how many stations there are to serve, and how long it takes to process each customer. Let's see. Arrival rate is predictable based on season, day of week and time. Processing time depends on work flow design but over the long term is under management control. Last but not least is the number of stations. This is definitely under management control. So if they can predict the customer arrivals, and can send staff down to assist in registration, then it is clear they just don't care how long their customers wait in line.Then get this. They tell us our room has been upgraded. Who knows why but I had not said anything at this point. But a room upgrade is nice so thank you. But guess what? Their are no chairs in the room. I wonder what would have been missing had I not got the upgrade? What level does it take to get chairs?",,red62tr4,13,1.0

Overall the quality of the rooms was lacking as well, old and cracking in places.

Yes the bathrooms need updating but my room was very clean and let's face it who goes to Hawaii to stay in the room. The view from my room was AMAZING!!! We arrived late on so our first view was at night which was just beautiful. Being from England and the time difference we were awake at 4am most mornings and I was surprised to see how busy waikiki was getting by 5am with people running along the beach and once the sun was up by half 6 the surfers were out. I did see a lot of homeless people and they are all over waikiki but they don't bother you for anything, they didn't us anyway. The pool at the hotel is small but my children loved it towards the end of the holiday as there were not many people using it so had it to themselves pretty much. Sunbeds were easy to get as like I say hardly anyone stayed round the pool due to either going to the beach or being on trips. We used the bus lots while here to get to places, saved hundreds of dollars by getting to places ourselves. A lot of the touristy places are actually free or very cheap. We managed to get the free tickets at uss Arizona and it cost me $5 to get there on the bus. We also got the bus to punchbowl which I'm glad we did as we spent a while there paying our respects and watching some guards there practising for a funeral that began as we were leaving. It's a beautiful setting and one that shouldn't be seen through a coach window. We also walked to diamond head from the hotel which was nice. It only costs a dollar to get in so again saved money by doing it ourselves. I highly recommend the go card as that too saved us hundreds of dollars. Do your research though as like I said a lot of the touristy things are actually free or cheap. Overall I loved this hotel and didn't want to leave. Word of warning though, there are lots of birds and I mean lots. One actually got into our room at night and laid an egg as well as making a mess all over my son's clothes.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay this year as we had previously. The hotel is in an excellent location; across the street is the beach, walk west on Kalakua Avenue you have all the activity, restaurants, & shopping, or walk east you have the quiet of the Kapiolani Park with the Zoo, Aquarium and band shell. The concierge and lobby/pool areas are clean and well laid out. Most importantly, our room was very clean, well laid out, and very comfortable. The view from our lanai was outstanding. The in-room safe is great for travel documents and other important items. The bathrooms are very clean, well-stocked and well maintained. The king bed was exceedingly comfortable which is a real bonus after a busy day of sightseeing. Recommend a Select (21st Floor and higher) Oceanview Room, well worth it. The hotel staff members are excellent. Every staff member we met during our stay performed their duties with skill and in a very friendly personable manner. Front desk, hospitality, pool, housekeeping, engineering and security personnel made our stay comfortable, secure, and pleasant. Any questions or concerns we expressed were handled promptly and effectively.I have to say the elevator system is the most efficient we have experienced. Swipe your room card at a kiosk and enter your floor number and one of 5 elevators will be assigned to you. Then, it’s get on and go. To go to the registration/pool level, press the star key on your floor. There are no rushes for the elevators at high traffic times and you don’t get on an elevator with all the floors selected by a previous prankster.The amenity fee covers a lot of great items. The free towels and beach chairs are a winner for us. The daily free local paper is great for finding out about the islands. We did not use the DVD and game kiosks but saw they were very popular with families and student groups.

We noticed that every time we used the elevators on level 1, there were always people there who were confused. Also, even though you could use the elevators to go from level 1 to your room floor, you could not go from your room floor to level 1 without stopping on level 3.

My recommendation, if you have a rental park at the pay lot by the zoo. It is $1.00 an hour and you can update the time on your cell, if needed. It is just around the corner from the hotel and you only have to pay for the time the car is parked.

I had requested ocean view but with accessible bathroom When we got there the room had the accessible bathroom but not a ocean view. We spoke to two ladies at the front desk who said they first met the accessible requirement and they don't have accessible rooms with ocean views, which seems strange. Being that our need is basically easy to get into tubs and we were paying for ocean view, we decided the ocean view was more desirable and that we would deal with the tub. The registration clerks were very helpful and changed our room immediately. They are great employees. The rooms have Keurigs which is nice. But they only supply the cups for the machine with coffee. As usual with all hotels I stay in, I have difficulty getting tea. The hotel did not have Keurig cups with tea which do exist. And there are also hot chocolate cups for kids etc. which I assume are also not available at the hotel. I brought my own tea and a apparatus to heat the water it as I always do. I did call down and ask and they said the Keurig made hot water and they would send up tea bags. They did do that but only green caffeine free tea bags with no other selection. Many of us drink black tea so I still supplied my own. I would suggest the hotel purchase the Keurig cups with tea for those that request it. There is a over $25 a day charge for amenities. It could easily pay for tea. I know this is a minor problem but when paying for a hotel of this caliber, my expectation are not unrealistic. 2 restaurants in building, many nearby which is a very nice feature.","Tacoma, Washington","wahenry98</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tacoma, Washington</strong>",19,5.0

Eggs 'n Things just outside reception and elevators. Easy walk (3-4 minutes) to bus stop, Zoo and aquarium.Easy access from airport (bus 19/20 Waikiki Beach Hotels - $2.50 OW) and to Ala Moana Center.**** Be aware of the daily amenity fee. It provides 'free' WIFI and DVD rental. It's overpriced, but almost all of them are******I recommend this hotel if you want to spend the day at the beach and walk to your room in a matter of minutes. Not a lot of frills, but the basics are there, it's clean and it's reasonably priced (for Honolulu).",Kansas,"BobthedogOR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kansas</strong>",20,4.0

However, every hotel in Honolulu has pretty much the same fees.

The rooms, I stayed in two, are dated and in need of renovation. The first room had a slow drain, and a sagging shower curtain rod that caused the shower curtain to slide open. The second room had a faucet that was tricky to get into the off position. Both rooms had relatively comfortable beds, always a plus, but the entire decor was drab and looked like a throwback to the 1980's. The lighting didn't help brighten up the place because it was too dim.It had a small refrigerator, and a Keurig one cup coffee maker, which is nice, but you only got 2 coffee pods per day, no tea. There's also a game/DVD player and you can get free rentals from machines in the lobby.The location directly across from the beach is fabulous. Their ""Tiki"" rooftop lounge is a wonderful place to watch the sunset. The drinks are expensive, as is the bar food menu, but not too bad. You don't feel gouged, and it's the price you pay for the lovely show that is Waikiki Beach.I would give this property a higher rating if I thought it was a good value for the price I paid, but they also charge a $25 per day resort fee, and if you don't want to have to scramble to look for parking, the valet-only parking is $32 a day, plus a tip for the attendant.

I unfortunately didn't do as much research as I did for our last trip and I booked during Black Friday weekend in a rush since everything seemed to be booked. So Aston Waikiki is what we decided on which looked fine online for the price but definitely was a change from our last hotel stay. The hotel is old with a small pool. Valet fee is pretty high but they are very quick to get your car out. You're not really ocean front as the main road is in front of you with the tiki bar below. It starts to get quiet around midnight where all you'll hear are the homeless people randomly yelling and smoking what appeared to be crack? Meth? Who knows...my husband got it on video when he was positioning his camera to do a couple time lapses late one night on the balcony. Check in was easy, the elevator system is a bit annoying as there's no direct way from your floor to the first level so we'd have to get off at the lobby then walk through the wet areas by the pool and then down the stairs. There are elevators but every time we'd swipe our cards it would keep saying to see front desk. The room and bathroom felt dirty to me, outlets are non existent or hidden behind the curtain and dresser which are then covered in dust. There's no microwave nor is there room service which I feel should be one or the other. The walls felt paper thin where we could hear everyone next to us. What really set me off was their printer being down for days, I needed a voucher printed and one front desk woman had me send it to her email to print out, perfect. 2 days later I ask another front desk person to print another voucher and apparently they had a meeting where it's not protocol to do that. BUT apparently it's totally normal and protocol to have a damn broken printer for multiple days with no damn solution in sight. Slow cleaning service as well. Came back in the afternoon and our room hadn't been touched yet, we just grabbed towels and toilet paper from the cart down the hall. Will I ever stay here again? Hell no. Would I recommend this place to my friends or family? Hell no. I'm here until Saturday and the experience has been below average. If you want to be in the heart of busy Waikiki with ocean views but not really being ocean front and don't plan on being in a dirty room/bathroom for long periods of time and don't mind having any amenities stay here. If not pay a little more and go somewhere else. I didn't think having access to your own little strip of beach was so important until we came here and saw how busy it is everywhere.

Similar to other reviewers, this hotel is conveniently located on Waikiki Beach (towards the end next to zoo) and right across the street from the beach. It's clean and basic. Dated and tired. It's like one of the Las Vegas hotels that get high use/turnover - and you can tell. Pool area was okay; meets basic needs. But it really didn't matter because the beach was right across the street. The $25 daily resort fee covered the towels and chairs to use on the beach; another feature that my kids enjoyed was the ability to check out DVD movies to play in room. For people with families, this is a convenient feature for bedtime. The hotel staff were nice but not as friendly as other Hawaii hotels I've stayed in. There's a balcony but no chairs to sit on.All in all, for the price point, it met our needs and we had a great time enjoying Hawaii. Who stays in their hotel anyway?",,4breo,2,3.0

It is clean, but the decor is quite dated. The overall feel is quite 1970s, which we really liked. However the bed was extremely comfortable, which is the most important. We had a balcony with sea view. So awesome and high up that we both had vertigo! The pool doesn't get a lot of sun, but you don't need a pool when Waikiki beach is a few steps away from the hotel. A Starbucks and an ABC convenience store are located directly below. No room service - but Lulus next door has good food. We also walked to Diamond ahead for spectacular views of Waikiki (some fitness required) plus a short walk to Leonard's, the best bakery in Oahu. We hired a convertible Jeep and drive around the island. I highly recommend a meal at the Cheesecake Factory. You will have a long wait, but it is the best food I've ever had!

Very clean nice hotel. Directly across from the beach. We had a partial ocean view and it's exactly what you get. The good- directly across from beach, great staff, cleanly, affordable The not so great- the restaurant tiki's we didn't really like the food so much. The happy hour was good from 2-5 every day. Was very expensive for everything else and some of the staff were really bad. The one night the waitress was so bad we were there for 2 hours and saw her twice. She forgot our drinks and ignored our table. The manager brought our drinks as he could see we were annoyed but the rest were great. Maybe she was overworked and busy but she sucked badly. It is an EXTREMELY busy place. Maybe because it was over Christmas but it was soooooo busy so if you want a quiet place to go. I somewhere else besides Waikiki beach haha. There were homeless people everywhere begging for anything And everything. Most were pleasant but some were aggressive. They think because you're on vacation you're loaded. Everything is very expensive. There's a quiet small little place around the corner in an alley that is super cheap for breakfast. Can't eat in there but it's cheap and pretty good. If you want shopping this is the place for you. There are SO MANY places to shop. I've never walked so much on vacation. But it was good! It's very beautiful as well The very badBeach vendors!!! They're in your face ALL THE TIME. You'd think going to Hawaii you'd be free of them but you are not. They yell at you in the street and one even said ""I'm not Isis you can talk to me"" because we ignored him. Because we'd seen him 50 times and said no thank you. There are daily resort fees of $23 as well on the hotel but we were told about these before. The safe costs money to use it each day. We didn't use it. A tip- buy booze at corner store, the hotel gives you towels and beach chairs just ask at pool, you can actually get drinks at tikis and take them pool side we didnt know this until the last day. There's a sign that says no drinking or eating poolside but this isn't the case It did suck that the pool only got sun after 3pm. But over all great stay!

I had stayed at the hotel next door during my previous visit, and since I wouldn't be returning there, I decided to try Aston Waikiki beach. It is so conveniently close to the ocean, all the shopping and Waikiki life. The lobby is on the 2nd floor, I had made a reservation with a payment to partial ocean view, non smoking room and a request the room to be away from the elevators. There were 3 people working at the front desk and I belive it was David who assisted us to check in and he confirmed my request for a room away from the elevators. We got checked in and took the most confusing yet convenient elevator to our room. The room was literally 7 steps away from the elevator. We got in and all we saw was the next hotel. You had to reach out and peek over to the right to see the ocean at a distance. What a disappointment. We made a call back to the front desk saying that this was unacceptable, as I had requested a room away from the elevator and it is exactly what they gave us. We closed the balcony door to leave the room and all you can hear is wind whistling. No way is anyone able to sleep in a room like that! So the gal at the front desk had prepared the second room for us and we got the keys exchanged and continued to the confusing elevators. Now this room was like an ashtray, it reeked of cigarettes. I had to sign a non smoking waiver threatening fees for smoking in the room, no way were we going to stay here and get second hand smoking cancer and fines for smoking which we didn't do.  November in Hawaii is a slow season, the hotel was no where near full, I didn't understand why they had to play this kind of a game with us. Upon returning to the front desk for the 3rd time, I wanted someone competent to assist us. This time I believe it was a supervisor Michelle, who attempted to show us where the available rooms were at. She suggested a room with a nicer view but again it was next to the elevators. Finally she got an approval to get us into a room, not facing the ocean but with an amazing view to the beach. The rooms are renovated but you can see it is a old building, the balcony doors, bathroom tiles and paint were old, as was the faucet and the shower. Supervisor Michelle called to check in if everything was ok with this room, which was a nice gesture. We stayed for two nights, the bar had a happy hour special for every day. Pool was small and mostly in the shade all day long, but it was clean. The Wolfgang Pucks restaurant had decent breakfast and lunch. And of course there are ABC stores in every corner.Would I stay here again? Most likely not.

The paint was discolored and the bathroom could use an overall makeover as the tiles were dingy and the shower head was very low, about chest height and I am 5'6"".Overall, I would stay here again, because the location and convenience of getting in and out.What you need to know:If you really want a view ask for a balcony over the pool, but ask for a higher room to avoid pool noise.Know that you are paying for location and not a fancy new looking room.If you uber to/from this hotel, make sure you enter the address as there is another Aston down the street an it can get confusing.","San Diego, California","Marquette N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",11,3.0

Good access to transport. Just across the road from Waikiki Beach. View from the room was great but the room and cleaning had some issues.As soon as I walked in there was a large wet patch of carpet outside the bathroom door. I complained about it and was told that all they could do was treat the spot with the wet vac and that it would only make it wetter than it was when we complained.The air conditioning wasn't working properly. It was pumping cold air but, the control panel was broken (the screen was completely blank) and couldn't be adjusted. It must have been set to igloo and after putting up with it for 2 days we finally complained. We reported it to the front desk and then went out for several hours only to find that nothing had been done when we come back at 9pm. When we went back to the front desk to complain again we were told that someone would be there in 10 minutes. I told the lady at the desk that a 9 pm I don't want to wait for a technician. At 9 pm I want to go to bed. We waited up for the technician who at 9 pm couldn't do anything anyway. He told as he would replace the control panel the next day. He came back the next day with a control panel he had acquired from another room only to find that it didn't work either and told us that if we were desperate and needed to switch it off that we should rip the control panel off the wall. He organised an electrician for the following day to come and replace the control panel yet again but this time with a new one.I also had to go to reception and request that the waste baskets be emptied when the room was serviced. It wasn't the only cleaning issue we found. I dropped something on the floor and while we were down on the carpet looking for it we found a penny, something that looked like a Malteser and a bottle cap. Also when I went to look out the window the sheer curtain had what looked like a dried booger on it. The bed head had a large black looking stain that appeared to be from someone's greasy head.

We arrived into Honolulu on an early morning flight and dropped by the front desk to see if any rooms were available. Not expecting anything much. A gentleman by the name of Sean was condescending and rude to my partner as he refused to even listen to him or even answer any questions. He just bluntly told him ""I already told you there are no rooms until check in at 2pm"". My partner hadn't even opened his mouth at this point. When we finally waited in line at 2pm we tried to ensure that we were not served by Sean. The lady who did check us in was lovely and offered us a complimentary photo frame to commemorate our wedding. Although, while we were waiting in line to be checked in we watched Sean be his same rude self to other guests. We'd highly recommend bringing this to Sean's attention.Our first room was nice and spacious with a partial ocean view (very partial). Then our second suite was large and spacious with stunning ocean views, and a separate living area, perfect for getting ready on our wedding day.The pool is nicely located next to the front desk. Nice way to wind down.James who looks after the front desk overnight was amazing, answering all our queries and accommodating all our requests. He is a superstar and a true asset to the business.FYI, the hotel and Tiki's Bar and Grill (who look after the Coconut Club) are separate entities operating in the same space.They are located on the edge of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. A fair walk to the centre of it all but ideally located right across the road from the beach.Would I stay here again?

I understand the area is fairly humid but I found mold in the closet top shelves about halfway into our stay and was immediately turned off but did not want to ruin my honeymoon by making a huge deal about it since more than likely there was nothing that could be done and we were already unpacked and settled in. The restroom mat that was used to place into the bathtub had black marks which looked like mold and was never changed out. The shower curtain was dirty I saw residue from last users on the rings that keep it onto the shower rod.The walls had random hairs stuck on it in the bathroom which I ended up just leaving alone because I didn't want to touch it. I'm just so happy that I bought disinfectant wipes with me, literally wiped down the entire room. Some of the towels we were given were dirty. The a/c maxed out at 65 which normally is great but it felt muggy and humid in the room thourghout the night so I feel like it would never reach the actual temperature which was extremely annoying. Smell was a little off but I guess that's normal for the age. Paint job for the room mediocrely completed. The 18th floor hallways was never air conditioned but I'm not sure if that applies to all the floors of the hotel. Our very first encounter with an employee at the front desk was immediately underwhelming. I forgot his name, I think it may have been Chris I'm not sure but he seemed very uninterested in being there. I even commented to my husband that I was very surprised how unfriendly the staff was already and I expected an experience way different . So he offered us a ""better room"" if we waited until 4:30 to check in instead of the original 2pm, so we said sure and went to grab a quick lunch. It might have just been him because when we returned to do our check in later on at 430 and Michelle was so much friendlier and helpful Even though our room wasn't ready until a little past 5. Housekeeping, bell, and valet staff were all great and friendly from the start. Honestly I probably would not stay here again just because overall I had more negative than good to say. I didn't want to be THAT guest who raised hell for every little problem and I also didn't want to ruin my honeymoon and first time ever coming to Hawaii.

This time around I was really disappointed in the rooms as I recalled them to be a bit more up to date. I'm not sure if they are in the process of remodeling some and haven't gotten through everything yet but my particular dislike was the bathroom. The floor specifically, it just looked incredibly dirty. I have no doubt it was being cleaned but I think it's just so old that there's nothing you can do really short of replacing it. The bathroom as a whole was small and very out dated. Other than that I was happy with the room, while it is on the smaller side, the bed is very comfortable. I may stay somewhere else next time around unless I hear that they have remodeled.What I DO like about this hotel is the location, it's on the far side of Waikiki Beach (towards Diamond Head) which results in slightly less people to fight with for a spot on the beach. It has the Tiki Bar and Grill which serves decent food but I particularly like their appetizers from the bar menu. The Chicken wings were amazing and the quesadilla was very good as well.

Our first impression was not good. Our reservation was set up by Expedia and was for a king bed with a partial ocean view. Upon arrival we were told all they had available was a two full with a partial ocean view. We ended up getting the room we booked after I put up a bit of an argument so it didn't ruin our stay totally but we definitely got off on the wrong foot. We didn't spend much time in our room except for sleep. The only complaint about the room itself is that it needed to be updated. The pool are was nice and the bar/restaurant had good food and drinks and servers. The other reason for the three stars was the protest we woke up to on the last day of our stay. Not sure if they were protesting the hotel or not. Signs just said no respect. Overall I would probably stay again but for the price difference I would tell my past self to choose a resort style hotel instead. ,"Roseville, Michigan","davidrI2336AE</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Roseville, Michigan</strong>",4,3.0

Their way of getting to your room is by swiping your room card and it tells you to push your floor number and then tells you which elevator to take and it takes right to your floor. The elevator is super fast, not scary fast but definitely not slow. You go to the 3rd floor to register and they explain everything to you! On the 3rd floor there is also a bar, inside and outside eating places and the food is reasonable and very good in the casual seating. We never ate on the inside so can't say about this, but after the 1st time we went to the casual eating we went there at least 5 more times to eat! All employees and the Housekeeping are very friendly and make sure you have everything you need. The other thing I liked about it was no one could get to your floor without a card and the restrooms on the 3rd floor where the bar, swimming pool and restaurants are has combination locks and unless you are supposed to be there you can't get into the restrooms!

What I love about this place is that it's on the main drag of Waikiki Beach, but being one of the last hotels along the line of properties; it provides a little more of a quieter atmosphere which is appreciated when you are in you're room. So you have the choice of being in the mix on the street, or having the peace and quiet from your room. The only improvement I could see is the quality and choices of their breakfast, I think they are better than the provisions that are offered; Although it's basic, I much prefer eating at Lulus for Breakfast, or even Cheeseburger in Paradise or the almighty Cheesecake Factory (best place in the world, truly).All in all Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel, and the Aston properties at that, live up to their ratings and price tag.

We had pre warned them that in the time we stayed here we were getting married, having our honeymoon and it was both myself and my (now) husbands birthdays.When we arrived we we're pleased to see that although the hotel is at the quieter end of the beach, it was an easy 10 minute stroll to the busier section of Waikiki (there is still LOTS near the hotel so no need to worry!).We were greeted by a lovely woman on the reception who congratulated us on our upcoming celebrations, presented us with a gift for the occasion and as I had requested a high floor away from the elevators was given the keys to room 2527. This room is on the top floor and I'm almost certain is the room the hotel took its pictures in for the website. (Aloha suite ocean view)The view was breathtaking and although the rooms/bathrooms are slightly dated I felt it was more than adequate for what we had payed for and most importantly it was clean and the bed was one of the comfiest I have ever slept on! Although we had an ocean view room we also had a balcony on our floor which faced out to diamond head which I have included a picture of and I know from when the cleaner had one of the doors open on that side of the hotel the view from those rooms was just as amazing.My slight grumble would be the amenity fee although I know this is something all hotels make you pay here, an addition £249 is steep!

Let me start off by saying that we enjoyed our stay, nothing was so unpleasent that it ruined our stay. With that said, I would more than likely never stay at this hotel again just because it was not really worth what we paid. When we arrived at the hotel checking in to our rooms went smoothly and the people at the front desk was friendly enough. I told them that I was there for my birthday and they offered us a free upgrade for our seconded nights stay. I'm not really sure why it was for only one night. That was great and all, but not really worth the trouble of checking out the next day, then waiting until 3 to check back in to the new room. The hotel on the out side and in the lobby was a lot nicer than the rooms themselves. Also the elevators, although small, were quite nice. I also want to say that the restaurants at the hotel were nice also. The pool was on the small side and closed very early, that was a big let down. There was also no hot tub. All in all the pool was just OK for us. The first room was a partial ocean view room with a very small walk out balcony. The view room the room was blocked mostly by another hotel, we latterly cold carry on a conversation with the hotel next to use with no problem at all, you are that close. The views that you could see were nice though. The room it self was ok in size, but the bathroom was quite small. The room and the bathroom were both very dated. The furniture was also old and worn looking. For the most part the room was pretty clean as well as the bathroom. The next day we moved to a deluxe partial ocean view and the ONLY thing deluxe about this room was the balcony was big enough for a small table and chair. The room itself was smaller, I guess to make room for the bigger balcony. Again the room and bathroom were both on the smaller size. We had 3 adults and I child in this room and it was quite cramped in there. The day of check out we were able to get an hour longer check out time which was nice. However when I went down to check out my fees that I was charged on my card were about a 80 dollars more than what was on my receipt itself. The man at the desk said that the charges would be changed that they always charge more then refund the rest. He said that it was just a hold, but it is day 2 and the charges have yet to change. Also we are a military family and we go a military rate that also refunded the resort charges, we were to get this as a visa gift card at check out, well they were out of gift cards so I was told that they would be mailed to me as soon as they come in. I asked if they could just take the 100 dollars off of our totally bill and we were told no. I then said that I would like a supervisors written instructions and signed stating what he had said about them mailing us our gift cards. I didn't want to get home call and check on them and then someone try and tell me that we already received them at checkout. This in itself took a few times me asking to get it. The man at the front desk stayed kind, but you could tell he was getting annoyed with me. So to this day I still am owed about 180 dollars from this hotel. Like I said in the before we will not stay here again, there are a lot better hotels around this same location for the same price and with nicer rooms and more amenities. Oh yes I almost forgot on the website that I viewed it said that the Aston offered a free "" breakfast on the beach"" meal, but when I asked about it at check in they said they no longer offer it, but yet they are still advertising it.

But we went right down to the lobby and we received a upgraded room the following day and after that everything was fantastic. Bus and trolley stops were right at our doorstep. Restaurants were close by no matter what you want to eat. Even the staff for excursions was extremely helpful when our booking through Viator when haywire.

Friendly staff. Interconnecting rooms : We had requested interconnecting rooms & double checked prior as had 2 young kids. Yes this is on request but also chose on basis they had interconnecting. When we checked in they weren't interconnecting. they were able to sort for us by taking a room on a lower level even though we paid for a higher level but we were fine with that. The interconnecting door didn't open but maintenance promptly fixed. Maintenance were always prompt & really friendly.We liked the live music from tiki's could sit on balcony & listen while kids were sleeping.Elevator system was great avoided long waits. Free DVD rental (incl in resort fee)Cons: air conditioning is average, struggles in the hot afternoons, maintenance checked it for us but not a lot they can do were told some rooms just needed upgrades. We didn't mind the noise of the aircon - good white noise for the kids. Decor a bit tired but expect this in a 3 star. Definitely had the hot/cold shower thing the second morning which some other reviews have mentioned. Strange as first morning was fine. Not pleasant been blasted with cold then hot, cold then hot. Even in a 3* you want a hot shower. Can be really long cues at reception definitely recommend express check out. Tip for families: After hearing that many Hawaii hotels aren't into early check ins we were arriving at 7am so opted to pay for 1 room the night before to guarantee it. after an all night flight with 2 young children we were glad we went for that option despite the added expense. Then we added an interconnecting room for the night we were actually sleeping there. Was really hot so good not to be waiting around all day with check in not until 3.

There's actually two beaches to choose from, both uncrowded compared to central Waikiki. Pricing is mid range and definitely value for money. If you want 4.5-5-star, then there are other choices but for a well priced hotel and great location, go no further. The Zoo and Aquarium just metres away. Like all hotels at some point in time, there's some need of soft refurbishment but overall, more than sufficient. The Tiki Bar would be one of the best bars in Waikiki, food quality and entertainment (every night) would be hard to beat. (and we have been to a lot of them) Add a 2pm-5pm happy hour, you can't go wrong.The overall service provided by the Hotel is great, very friendly and professional staff.

If you do not plan on spending a lot of time in the room, then this is not a bad place. We had a problem with the front desk and the charges. They put a hold for our amenities fees, on our credit card, which was not an issue. Then they put a note on our car, to see service desk, that was parked there. Once at service desk, they put a hold on our credit card, which was not an issue. When we got back, we parked our car and my son and his friend parked their cars. They called the room and said we needed to come down to service desk. We were told that they need to put another charge on our CC. We asked for what and they said because we had 3 cars parked there. But yet 2 of them were parked over night. The cost is $30 a day valet parking. $150 was what we were expecting, but they said that we needed to come up with $450 to cover the 3 cars, or we would be locked out of our room. After the manager got evolved, my sons parking was free, for the night. The trip was good until this point and it was aggravating and embarrassing, as we were on a budget and only put money on the card when needed.

Rooms overall are small. But hey, aren't they all small in Waikiki. The interior is decorated adequately. The washroom however, could use a MAJOR upgrade. Bed is comfy but last I checked, it's 2016. Most hotels have depleted the use of the nasty 1990 wool blanket and replaced it with a nice thin duvet. Aston believes in recycling and reusing I guess. Was booked in a ocean view room on the 25th floor. Views from the balcony are breathtaking. Fitness Centre is one of the better ones compared to the other hotels I've stayed at in Waikiki. Offers newer machines and free weights. Pool area is okay, not spectacular or bad. Could upgrade and install a hot tub since most hotels offer that amenity. The week went by great until our last day. We had a 630am flight and had arranged our transfer to pick us up at 445am. After retiring in our room at 115am, I plopped on the bed and started checking emails. In the corner of my eye, I saw something moving on the pillow. Sure enough, the fear in many travelers was happening right before my eyes. I had a bed bug on the pillow!!!!I sprang into action and called front desk. He apologized to me for and said that he could NOT do anything because no manager was on site, but could only change my room until I check out. He instructed me that housekeeping and security will be coming to my room to investigate. I waited 15 minutes and no one came. By this time my husband took the bedbug and went to front desk himself to complain. Housekeeping later came and took apart our whole room. We were later moved to another room until checkout. By this time it was 215am. At checkout, they credited my portfolio $50 for the inconvenience caused and was told a manager from the property would contact me as soon as possible regarding this matter. It's been 8 days at the time of writing this review since I've been back from my trip and still NO ONE has contacted me. I'm truly appalled by how my incident was handled, as I'm sure all hotels have a protocol they must follow when bedbugs are found. I wish the front desk personal was a tad more professional and more EMPATHETIC to our situation. We solely feel because of our checkout time, not a lot was done because in a few hours we'd be out of their hair. I was planning to write a great review about this stay. Sadly because of the last few traumatizing hours at Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel, I will not remember the lovely ocean views, or the gorgeous sunset views from my balcony. My husband and I will only think of the nasty blood sucking bug crawling on our pillow. Aston, step up your game. If you want to be respected like other major hotel chains, make sure your guests are treated properly!

Travelling by bus is fairly simply , just $2.50 each for a journey but you must have the exact money as the drivers dont carry change, or the local ABC stores sell bus cards We had a fantastic stay at this hotel, their staff are a credit to them as everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful I would defnitely stay here again and wouldnt hesitate in recommending it to anyone Thank you Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel for making our first trip to Waikiki so memorable","London, United Kingdom","Angel305</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",14,5.0

Check-in was quick and our request for a room on a higher floor was accommodated. The elevators are accessed using your room key and punching in your floor level for security reasons. Little confusing at first but easy to use once you get the hang of it. We were thrilled with the view of Waikiki and spent much time out on the lanai. The room was on the smaller side with one of the double beds pushed up against the bathroom wall. Bathroom is dated but we didn't mind. Beds were comfortable but sleeping was occasionally disrupted by some late night partiers below at Tiki's restaurant. Also the sliding glass doors can be hard to open/close and you hear everyone around you using theirs. City noise (trash/recycling trucks and emergency sirens) also easily come right through the sliders. Valet was efficient as we usually called down before we left our room to have our car pulled up. Bell/Valet were very helpful also with our needs. We were staying there to move our daughter into the dorms at University of Hawaii. They quickly brought our boxes and supplies purchased to our room and were very helpful in bringing it all back down and packing everything into our car for move in day.

We indicated we want a king bed and that this trip is for our wedding anniversary. Upon arrival at reception, we weren't even greeted with the usual ""Aloha / welcome"". There were 2 of them and 1 of them just told us ""she will be right with you"" (referring to the other girl who was on the phone). The person who told us this wasn't even helping someone else at the time so I don't know why she couldn't help us herself. Finally after a few minutes the girl got off the phone and helped us (no Aloha /welcome greeting still). She told us that they are really busy and they don't guarantee the type of bed and thus they don't have a king bed for us. They gave us a room with what they claim has 2 queen beds but when we got there it was more like 2 twin size beds. The earliest we can get what we paid for which was a partial ocean view room with a king bed was the next day. So this was a waste of time for us because instead of us unpacking and settling in that night we had to wait the next day which messed up our plans for the next day. This is not a good way to run a business. How can you say you don't guarantee the type of bed, this is the first time I have heard of this. Every time we go on a vacation we get a king size bed. These hotels are busy too but they are able to work with our requests. This makes Aston seem incompetent by telling us they are busy so they cant accomodate requests. We paid for the room, it should have already been reserved for us regardless of how busy you are or tell us that we cant have what we paid for so we could have moved to a different hotel. Not impressed with this and taking into consideration as well that we indicated it is for our wedding anniversary and Aston gave us 2 twin beds??? It doesnt even end here, when we got transferred to a king bed the next day, the room safe was not working so we had to call it in at around 3 pm. We got back at around 7 pm and still not fixed so we had to call it in again. Finally when we came back at 10 pm it was fixed. The room was mediocre which we expected as it is an older hotel. It was clean though. But with the nightly rate we paid and the daily amenity fee they charge you, we expected better service which we did not get (other than the housekeeping which was great). On our first night there we did not feel welcome and we felt insulted because they gave us 2 twin beds for our wedding anniv.

We ended up on the top floor which is 25. Facing the Waikiki Beach. The view is simply amazing. The other side of the hotel faces toward Diamond Head if you prefer that view.

Overall this stay at the Aston Waikiki beach hotel was outstanding. There is a hotel amenities fee and a tax that we paid when we checked out because we had prepaid our room. It amounts to about $25 per day. This hotel is within walking distance to the Honolulu Zoo, and Diamond Head is a short bus ride or walk away about 2 miles or so. So much shopping is nearby you can buy almost anything for the beach or clothing.The sunset views from the Lani are the best thing ever just incredible.

I was told they would add that to the reservation and all seemed well. When we were in the airport I called AGAIN to confirm our reservation was an oceanfront view (which it was and it was pretty phenomenal) and asked again about the crib. The representative said there were no notes about a crib but that she would add them. Then when we arrived at the hotel (which by the way you have to pay a mandatory 30 dollar per day valet fee) we asked at check in AGAIN for the crib. The front desk rep that checked us in was very nice and even offered us a late check out for an additional fee of 50.00 but said there was NO crib listed in the reservation.I gave this hotel several phone calls prior and not a single one of those people made that note about the crib. When we went to our room, we waited for an hour (it was almost 8:30 by this point) and STILL no crib. I have no idea why getting a crib was this hard. We called down to front desk and asked for it AGAIN and then it arrived 15 minutes later. The crib was dirty, the sheets as well, and my daughter woke up with bites on her face from which I can only assume are bed bugs or something else in the room. The room itself was literally a Motel 6 style which was clearly never renovated from the 60's except for artificial thick brown gloss paint on the doors and new furniture, which looked worse then second hand. Honestly, it was gross. HOWEVER, the view was phenomenal as long as you don't mind your neighbors literally staring at you from your balcony. No privacy and awkward. We will not stay here again. If you're planning to celebrate something special or traveling with family, there are better places out there.

Bathrooms could use updating.This is not a resort. You have tikis bar and grill on site by the pool. Let's be honest the restaurant is not that great. Good for drinks that's about it.What really kills it is the $25 daily resort fee, and the $30 per day parking fee. If your here for a week, that's a good chunk of change. No they don't tell you about this ahead of time. A sneaky hotel charge. You only hear about the parking fee when you pull up to the valet. Elevator system is funky. Takes some time to get use to. Your right on Waikiki beach so that's about all this place has going for it. I would never stay here in a non ocean view room.

The room has Keurig coffee maker, and playstation, wifi internet, and welcome beauty kit upon arrival in the room which included on the hotel fee. The only thing i dont like is the set up of this hotel. When you arrive on the ground floor, is the hotel lobby and where Valet is located. Ive noticed while i was sitting on the lobby, a lot of their Guests when they arrive at the hotel are confused where the Check In located. We had to go up to the 3rd floor to check in and you can take elevator or escalator and this is also where the Pool and the Tiki Bar and Grill are located. Once you're done checking in, you will be given a card key that you can use for the elevator and your room. Although, a bit pricey but it was great. We've checked out the next day but they have free storage for your luggage all day if you have late flights at night. They also can arrange shuttle to the airport for $12 per person at Valet. One tip I can share also is NOT to take TAXI from the Airport to any Waikiki Hotel as they cost a lot for USD$45 + $3 for luggage handling. If you can arrange your shuttle from the airport to Waikiki will be much better i.e. Roberts Hawaii cost $15 per person or other shuttle only cost $12 pp. The Parking is $30 a day but if you park near Honolulu Zoo is $1 per hour.","Ottawa, Canada","chaddavid</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",49,5.0

We arrived early and were glad to have a room available for us upon our arrival. We were on the 21 st floor and had a great partial ocean view overlooking Waikiki and Diamond Head. The only thing I would have changed was to maybe be up one floor so we didn't look right into the hotel next to us.The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was clean. The bathroom may be a little dated, but it served our needs well.It was great to have access to towels and chairs. This was great for our time on the beach. It is conveniently located right across the road from Waikiki Beach and there are tons of restaurants and stores close by. We loved going to Tiki's for Happy Hour and we really enjoyed Sansei across the road at the Marriot for some really great sushi. We really appreciated the late check out. We found the cost reasonable ar $50 to be able to check out at 4 pm.Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it.","Sherwood Park, Canada","780sunseeker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sherwood Park, Canada</strong>",8,4.0

Check in was quick and straightforward, room was easy to find and nicely Hawaiian decorated. Like other reviewers I did find the bathroom to be quite dated but a lot of Hawaii felt dated and it had the basic amenities so I see no reason to complain about it. The shower head was quite low but it was manageable. Our room overlooked queens beach, disappointed it was the wrong time of year for the Hawaii 5-0 premier as we would have had an amazing view. As it was our honeymoon we received a small gift from the hotel and our bridesmaid had called in advance to arrange a gift basket of wine, fruit and macadamia nuts. Breakfast was basic and to be honest we only used it twice as we preferred to go out and have a larger breakfast to set us up for the day. The pool we only used on our last day as we had to check out a good few hours before our flight. Location was perfect, option of two different beaches across from the hotel, one with a rock edge to make it more pool like the other a typical beach with waves crashing to the shore. Next door to the zoo and only a short walk from the shops and restaurants of Waikiki and the aquarium. Dined in tikis a couple of times and loved how convenient the hotel was to other options with a Wolfgang puck express, subway and cold stone creamery on the ground floor. Ideally located for abc but I think everywhere in Waikiki is. Word of advice is to use the abc store down the side of the hotel as the one on kalakau is dearer with it being so close to the beach.

My family (daughter & husband) stayed at the Aston and we had a great time! check in: Fast and efficient. We did not have any trouble checking in and the room given to us is what we had asked for ""BREATHTAKING VIEW"".. 16 floor.. Room: Was of reasonable size, not too large - two Queen beds, very comfortable to sleep in and the pillows were soft and had a great night sleep. NOT FANCY! Only CON in the room was the missing remote control; which guest services took care of it right away. Also, the air conditioner had problems because it was outdated. We didn't want to move rooms so we left the air running all day and the problem was fixed. The room came with a refrigerator; which made it very convenient for us; I would recommend they had a microwave also, just to warm up any leftovers (specially when traveling with kids). The housekeeper made the beds every day and organized the room- always smelling clean and refreshed (note: we left a tip every day; because of the great service). Overall was nice room, not too fancy; but, worth your money. Location of the Hotel: Perfect!! Close to all the shopping stores, food, beach, local eateries and the zoo (one block distance). Loved the convenience.. Also, If you would like to snorkel you can take a day to visit Hanauma Bay - the bus that takes you there is (line 22) drops you off right at the site for $2.50 each way. You also have the convenience to take the trolley right in front of the lobby.. Great location.Ambiance: Had breakfast and Lunch at the Tiki Grill - loved their food & service ***** five stars!! The ambiance was great throughout the day, live music playing, great cocktails and the people there are so nice, polite and know how to have fun.. Very safe for kids, they have hotel personnel always walking around to make sure everything is in order.. Pool: Clean, not too big 6 feet I think was the dept. Lots of families with their children. No lifeguard on site (parent discretion). They had lots of chairs and they provide towels and beach chairs. You can take them to the beach across the street; but you do have to return them by the end of the day. Overall: Nice, clean, and convenient Hotel. They have a little market on the lobby with all the essentials (soda, milk, cereal etc..) ATM on site, Tour booths available on site if you would like to book tours throughout the day.

We stayed here 4 years ago and noticed some maintenance that needed carrying out ( bathrooms especially )and forgive it as the location is amazing, the staff are 5 star ( you cannot fault the staff, they are amazing ) and thought those issues would start to be addressed, however the bathrooms dont look to have had any care and are starting to look very tired indeed, in our room the soap dish was coming away from the wall and shower head attachment from the wall is moving at its own will, the tiles need some attention, a lick of paint would make all the difference and some very simple maintenance fixes. The staff make this place and it's fabulous location and I would implore management to start putting some money into the place. Also it's a bit of shame that employment relations have broken down to the point that there are a small but determined number of demonstrators outside waving placards, also a shame thatA4 flyers from both disgruntled employees and responses from management are posted under people's doors, each revoking the others claims. So here's the thing, sit down, sort out your Maintenance issues and start an open dialogue with those demonstrators ( although to be fair you may have tried to do this already). I am still giving a 4 star review as I believe those staff we met deserve that and more, house keeping, good job, front desk, Jono, good job.

We were served by a young man who didn't seem confident with the check-in system and it took him around 20 minutes to sort out our rooms. Then when we reached our rooms, our keys (cards) for both did not work. We then had to line up again in reception to receive new keys. The next attendant we had was swift in resolving our problem, offering sincere apologies for the inconvenience. This admittedly was the only hiccup we had staying at this hotel. Our rooms were amazing and were serviced daily by our room attendant, Rosanna. Who was always lovely and chatted to us when we ran into her in the corridor. We had a slight problem with our Wi-Fi connection, which was attended to within ten minutes of calling reception. The gentlemen who fixed it was wonderful, also very talkative.The location of this hotel is brilliant, Towards the left end of Waikiki beach. Surrounded by numerous restaurants, and ABC stores (of course!) But because it is one of the last hotels along the Waikiki strip it is out of the way of all the hustle and bustle. It's a ten minute stroll down to the main part of Waikiki beach, just a little further up are all the retail shops and it is less than a two minute walk to the Zoo!A trolley bus (USD$2 each way) stops/picks up from outside the hotel which takes you to Ala Moana shopping centre. Tikis Bar and Grill is attached to the hotel on the same floor as reception, which is a happening and popular place to go, Meals are a little expensive as are drinks, but the atmosphere and view makes up for it.

The ""breakfast on the beach"" is somewhat chaotic in the mornings, everyone gets into line at the same time and the options are somewhat limited. However, take it for what it's worth, a solid continental breakfast plus a few hot items. Take advantage of the portable nature and get out of the craziness by taking the food to the beach or back to your room. The attached (but separately owned) Tikis' restaurant is also pretty good, featuring local classics and comfort food, with excellent tropical tiki drinks and happy hour specials. The pool area is small, but when we were there, it was never too crowded after breakfast died down.

However here, I am just tired of Aston. Too many issues last time and this time as well. TV was almost falling on me, toilet flush very hard, bathroom door quite beat up, refrigerator not working, crappy coffee and on and off wifi. Most of these got addressed quickly but it was getting to the point for me that no matter how nice (and they were) or quick the staff is, I just should not be having this many issues with my hotel on vacation. The best they did is give me 2 nights credit for the daily service fee. I know all hotels at least in Waikiki charge such fees, but still when you charge fees for things that normally other hotels don't charge fees for, I expect working quality. I just don't feel Aston puts any effort into preventive hotel maintenance like other hotels, especially chain ones. If I go to Choice hotel or best western, I would be pressed to find a place with so many problems. Maybe Motel 6 could have some thing like that, but I thought Aston is a bit higher than motel 6 and they certainly don't price their rooms like motel 6:) $30 / day parking fee - takes forever to get it from valet, sometimes over 15-20 min.

Our check in was very easy and didn't take to long at all . We arrived and hour and a half before check in and although they weren't able to give us our allocated room next to our friends, they did accommodate us by putting us both on another floor but not next to each other, which really wasn't a problem. This way we were able to check in earlier. The pool although not huge was very clean and there were plenty of chairs and lounges around it. They supplied good towels for both the pool and the beach. The Hotel is right opposite the 'pool' areas of the beach which was great to learn how to paddle board , swim & snorkel. Also the Hotel is 'at the end of the strip' near the zoo so away from a lot of hustle & bustle.

The ocean view from most of the rooms is at about an 80 degree angle, so it is awesome only if you go out on your tiny balcony and sit sideways (we looked many times and never saw anyone out on their balcony on our entire side of the hotel or the side of the hotel facing us during entire week we were there) or if you stand in one spot in the room. You can move the table and tall chairs to that spot, but then only one person really has the view.The location on the Diamond Head side of Waikiki is good because it is less crowded. Also, you are closer to the following attractions on that side: Diamond Head (of course), a good sushi restaurant on the way to Diamond Head, outdoor volleyball courts, a pier/jetty people jump off to boogie board, a beach next to the jetty with lots of fish in clear water, and a real farmers market in the park on the way to Diamond Head (the other farmers’ market, on the opposite side of Waikiki, is mostly for tourists, with overpriced items and mangos from Mexico).The mandatory “resort fee” is only worth it if you want to see a lot of new release DVDs in your hotel room instead of exploring the island or walking through Waikiki. Similarly, the small pool, with no slide, diving board, nor enough length for laps, is not fun or interesting enough to justify swimming there instead of in the ocean.Tip: The front desk staff are very helpful, for example, providing good directions to farmers markets and explaining where to catch the bus.On the same level as the front desk, there are a series of independently operated desks labeled as “concierge” services. These are really just private contractors selling tour packages and rental cars. One, the Budget Car Rental, provided a rate better than we would have gotten if we had gone directly to Budget. We went to Budget to pick up the car, and they had our reservation and rate we had negotiated at the Aston “concierge”/contractor.","Ventura, California","David G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ventura, California</strong>",39,4.0

That being said, I would definitely recommend this hotel. I've stayed at several hotels on the Waikiki strip. I LOVE that this is NOT centrally located because it is at the end of the ""strip"", which is much quieter and the beach is calmer too. I would definitely recommend upgrading to an ocean view room, SO worth it. I found that the room and linens were very comfortable, the FIRST hotel that I actually LOVED the pillow. I slept so well here. The bathrooms are a little dated, but for all intents and purposes are fine. You did not come to Hawaii to hang out in the bathroom. Resort fees are everywhere, add to that daily valet only parking fees, that can be kind of an unexpected surprise at checkout. That being said, this resort fee included a very handy beach tote and pouch with helpful sunscreen toiletries, playing cards, and fans. I used the beach tote as my ""purse"" the whole time in Hawaii. The resort fee also included free DVD rentals and beach chair rentals. I loved having the mini-fridge in the room because you can never get too have too much cold water in Hawaii. I found that the staff were very helpful and friendly. Getting your car from the valet can take some time, but just call ahead 15 minutes before.

Add the fact that the hotel's price is similar to some of the accommodations more than a block away, and you have a great value in Aston Waikiki Beach. My one gripe with the hotel is that when I booked, they were still offering Breakfast on the Beach, and had I not read TA reviews from this past winter, would not have known that it was discontinued. Instead, based on the date of my booking, I was offered breakfast vouchers to be used at Tiki's. While I only took advantage of breakfast at the hotel restaurant on one morning, the high cost of food in Honolulu makes the vouchers a great value.

That never happened so I called again and asked for a rug to put over the wet spot. When housekeeping came they brought in a huge loud fan instead and left it blowing.

We stayed in an Aloha Suite (Partial Ocean View) which gives you beach/ocean views towards Diamond Head (but not Diamond Head itself). While not as stunning as the other side of the building it was very pleasant and the room more than made up for the lesser view. The suite is very large and comfortable and has a nice modern décor. The facilities are quite adequate and there are 2 good sized double beds plus a sofa bed. The great things about this property are the location (directly across the road is the beach) and the fact that it is very affordable. Food and beverage wise; the hotel itself does not have any offerings but at the front on pool level is the Tiki Bar which is a great place to eat or just have a drink. There seemed to be live entertainment every night and the place was always humming. Downstairs there is a Wolfgang (something or other) which has good affordable food for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The staff at the Aston were consistently very friendly and very helpful and all got a 10/10 from us. The hotel is probably a 15-20min walk to the heart of the shopping strip but nothing that deters from it's location. This was our second stay in Waikiki and I would rate this hotel much better than the previous one used (beachfront only a 100 or so metres away.

It's close to a range of food options, with really good access to a kid friendly beach. The staff were very accommodating, moving our 2 separate rooms together (travel agent stuffed this up), happy to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Valet service downstairs had answers to all questions. During the morning of our 2nd last night, there was protest on the street (picket signs, and mega phones) demanding fair pay for Aston employees. Police keeping everyone civil but not sure of more details. Was surprised by it is all. The restaurant (Lulu's) and bar (Tiki Bar) had great options for formal dining, or casual eats. Great to get a table near the edge and watch the sunset. Staff made this a great experience. Sat by the bar one night and was well looked after, being offered samples of local beers before trying a pint. And recommended an epic cherry infused bourbon not available in Australia. Others have said that the Pool isn't big enough, but maybe it just wasn't as busy when we were there. Virtually had the pool to ourselves when we were there, but why swim in the pool when the kid friendly end of Waikiki beach is straight across the road. The hotel is situated on the best end of Waikiki Beach, with the break wall making swimming great for kids with no waves. Visit an ABC shop, spend $2 on an inflatable lounge, and laze about floating on the most iconic beach in hawaiiShopping is easily accessible via the pink line trolley (tram bus thing) stops outside the hotel, $2 to get on and follow a circle that stops at the best shopping spots (let the wife go crazy will you enjoy a mai tai by the pool).

We didn’t use some of the things covered by the fee (e.g. entertainment center), but that’s the real world, other people do use them.I have to say the elevator system is the most efficient we have experienced. Swipe your card, enter your floor number, and one of five elevators will be assigned to you.The hotel provides a very secure environment. Their security staff are present but not obtrusive. We have never felt uncertain of our safety.Over the last few years we have often chosen the Aston as our home for our holidays. The hotel continues to provide holiday comfort while evolving to meet changing demands.

I didn't know what it was when I first saw it, but my curiosity got the best of me and I had to walk over to it. It's very interesting and has a great (but sad) history.The room wasn't luxurious, but it fit our needs just fine. We were rarely in the room, except to sleep and shower anyway. There was plenty of room and the beds were comfortable. The housekeeping ladies were fantastic, and we always came back to a freshly cleaned room every night.The staff at the hotel always made us feel welcome. We had a slight issue with our door lock, and they had a maintenance man there within 10 minutes to fix it. I tried to give him a tip, but he wouldn't accept it, which I thought was very professional of him.We enjoyed the breakfast on the beach featured at the time we were there. We always took our muffins to the beach. My granddaughter really enjoyed this because she got to feed the birds. She literally had birds sitting on her hands waiting to be fed.I would recommend this hotel to families in particular.

We had no choice but to upgrade to an Ocean view room which was $17.1 USD per night including tax. Being jetlagged and quite tired we turned on air con (which didn't work) and slept. I complained about the air con as it didn't work only the fan did. The technician came to fix it and although it did work it would be so cold even if you raised the temperature to 30 degrees. The technician was called again to fix the bathroom as the water wasn't receding when we had a shower. On the second night there our WIFI stopped working and no one could assist us, I complained the next day and was offered a $5 USD discount, this happened a second time 2 nights later and I was offered a $12 USD discount who the person processed as a charge and I only found out when I checked out. One of the nights we had a fire alarm go off at 1230am and no one bothered to tell us that it was a false alarm even though we stayed in our room for at least 20mins after the alarm went off (thinking it was a false alarm) before leaving our room. We only got told of it when we asked the front reception. It also happened a night before we had to visit Pearl Harbour and we had to wake up at 5am the next day. On one of the days we arrived back to our room at 3pm and our room wasn’t even serviced. We had to request for it to be done and all they did was replenish the bathroom amenities. Housekeeping was slow to deliver anything you ask for and I had to make a second call on most occasion to find out when I would get things delivered like bath towels. Overall it was a very disappointing stay, I mentioned this to Chris upon checkout and he had refunded 3 days of amenity fees. Not worth the upgrade we paid for to be honest.

So, it's hard to give it 3 stars; there's SO much to appreciate about this property. Let's get the negatives out of the way: the room we had was worn and out-dated. We requested a Deluxe Partial Ocean View - and the view was amazing from our lanai (but had only 1 chair, which seemed odd) but ""deluxe"" didn't apply to the accommodations. While the beds were comfy, the water pressure adequate, the coffee maker, refrigerator and TV all worked as promised, there was just a worn-out feeling to our room. Furniture is dated, bathroom needs complete updating and thorough cleaning and the AC a bit tricky to regulate. Now the positives: location, location, location. On the Diamondhead end of Waikiki, the Aston sits on Kalakaua Ave and across from a quiet, protected beach. This area is less congested, with the park, zoo and aquarium less than a block away. There are several eateries on the property (independent of the hotel) that offer quick sandwiches, pizza, burgers etc. Two ABC stores are steps away as is a Starbucks and a Jamba Juice.Can't say enough about the staff, especially housekeeping. The ALOHA spirit is evident and our requests were met quickly and with a smile. Our room was serviced every day and any issues were quickly resolved.The amenity charge receives quite a few negative comments from guests but it's clearly stated in the reservation info so shouldn't be a surprise. We didn't miss BOB (Breakfast on Beach) and appreciated the extra sunscreen products etc in the amenity bag (although a $90 value seems inflated). WiFi service was spotty throughout our stay but we were able to stay connected as needed. Beach towels and chairs are available at no additional cost at pool-side. Overall, the Aston is still a good value offering a wonderful location in Honolulu. Pay for the ocean view room, accept a little wear and tear, and enjoy incredible sunsets over Waikiki - you won't be disappointed.

As we were only staying 2 nights we declined to have room cleaning service. The check-in was easy to find on floor 2. The restaurants they had were nice, they will also keep your luggage if you arrive early or need to checkout but keep it there for awhile. Their elevators were interesting but very fast and prompt, staying on the 21st floor in this case took a mere 30 seconds to ever get down or up. The location is excellent. Right across from the beach, on the right is a breakwall to allow for calm relaxing water and it's divided by a wall on which the other side is totally wave unobstructed. They also allowed us to check in 30 min early. They also gave us the highest room with 2 dbl beds and their partial ocean view was spot on.Negatvies: The special fee they collected was definitely not worth it, whatever it was a resort fee or whatever. They give you a tiny thing of sunscreen, all in all worth maybe $15, a few dvd rentals, and ps3 access in your room. I found this charge to be too high, at most it should have been $10 additionally a day if that. The lanea was incredibly small, you could maybe fit 2 adults on it standing, no room to sit down with a chair.All in all I would stay here again for sure. If you are on a romantic getaway or expecting a 5star treatment, go elsewhere, It's disappoints me to hear those complain about this resort when it;s been made clear what it is. You want a butler and 1000 thread count sheets, go to a 5 star hotel, don't choose a solid place like this, ignore all the reviews, and then rate it badly. It's ignorant for those who do this. If you need a good place to sleep, a good location, and still a quality place, here ya go.","Kent, Ohio","826jasong</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kent, Ohio</strong>",18,4.0

They stopped doing that a few years ago, so don't expect it and be disappointed like we were. They will give you a nice bag of pricey suncare products that really work - instead of breakfast, I guess. There was a loud worker protest (drums, noisemakers, yelling and chanting songs) very early one morning. I thought it was cheerleaders at first. Apparently, Aston/Xenia housekeepers make quite a bit less than Marriott workers next door. We were given a flyer about it under the door that asked us to mention that on Tripadvisor and yelp. It only happened once during our stay or I probably would have looked for a quieter place. The beds are soft, too soft for us, but some people may like that. The AC was really cold and we could not get it to turn off for any length of time. There is a Keurig, but you only get 2 pods per day. Sometimes someone will knock on the door in the morning and offer you two more. There is convenient shopping and beach activities within walking distance.

Check out Super Shuttle (all mercedes vans) for their inexpensive accessible vans with a 24 hour notification and Ace Medical if you are in need of a patient lift. We used Roberts Hawaii 54 foot tour bus in our ""Circle the Island Tour"" on land. The bus has a lift in the back and really made the 9 hour ride comfortable.

When we booked they offered free breakfast but when we wandered around lost the next morning they told us that they did away with that. I explained to them that was one one of the reasons I booked this hotel and they suddenly provided me with $60 worth of vouchers for the onsite restaurant which was probably worth more than the free breakfast they had been serving. Rooms are average, we didn't spend a lot of time there. The TV was horrible, kept cutting out and freezing up.

The check in staff that helped us when our flight was cancelled and we needed to book another night- sorry I didn't catch your name you were very helpful. The view was fantastic- we booked ocean views and for the price thank god we had side ocean views. The downside- the first room we were in had two beds instead of the requested king bed which may have been who we booked through. The amenities tax? The DVD player (PlayStation) didn't work and every time we rented movies they never worked. We used the wifi out of the whole amenities tax. Quite expensive. Housekeeping would knock at our door anytime from 730 am onwards- even this time is early without considering the time difference where were from. Our room was cleaned and towels and cups were taken and not replaced and when we called they either wouldn't come or if have to call again there was long black and red hair on our beds. Both of us are blonde. The bathrooms were dirty in the corners and dusty with mould in the shower. The check in process was horrible. After being in transit for 20 hours we had to wait in line for 30 minutes as there was only two people on check in with a large crowd awaiting to check in. Overall the room was quite expensive.

Had no idea how to pick a hotel so went with one on the beach that looked like a good value. We had such a great time at this hotel that we cut our trip to another island short to stay an extra day here. This is what makes the hotel special - first it's a bargain. Basically a hundred bucks less a night then other ones right around it. It has beautiful views. It's literally across the street from the beach. Not a few blocks away like some of the pricier hotels that don't have direct beach access. It has a great sit down restaurant and deck restaurant, accessible from the pool deck, both of which have great food and beach views. The staff were without exception, very friendly and helpful, even when they were obviously slammed with check ins and check outs and people from all over the world speaking different languages. They were very patient and efficient. The rooms are not fancy, but we found them to be very clean and comfortable. Bed was great. Room was a very nice place to relax after a day out, especially the balcony. I cannot overstate how beautiful the views are from this hotel (some of the rooms may not have views but looking at it from the street, it appeared most or all do; we had a deluxe ocean view; not sure what standard rooms have). There's a little store on the street level and lots of other stores and restaurants right around the hotel. No need to have a car. In fact, skip a rental car and just take trolleys and shuttles (like the shuttle to Hanauma bay or the airport shuttle for which you can buy round trip tix at the airport at baggage claim). They all stop at the hotel. The pool deck also has a great view of the beach and the sunset. Basically, you can have a great time just going from your room, to the pool, to the beach, to the hotel restaurants, to the little store, etc. (not sure if the restaurants are part of the hotel but it's all connected so very convenient). Sort of like a resort, but not super expensive and isolated (and boring) like other resorts. It just has a great vibe to it. And it's at what I consider the best location on the beach. Toward the zoo end rather than the marina end. So you can walk to any part of the beach in just a few minutes - the more crowded parts or the less crowded.

The first morning we were waken up by knocks on the door, which was the coffee capsule refill service. We didn't hang the 'privacy please ' card since there was no one in our room. So I had to creat one with the hotel envelope and my handwriting and hung it on the door handle when we left. The most unbelievable thing occurred on the morning of the day we checked out. We received bill but no any notice of the broken-down of the elevators. We had to call front desk asking what had happened and told them we were heading to the airport and don't want to miss our international flight. After couple of calls, we were able to get down with assistance from some staff. We were lucky that day because we wanted to leave earlier than catching-flight needed to do some last stop shopping at the airport, otherwise, it would be very likely that we have to stay longer at Hawaii.They knew we were checking out that morning and they knew the elevators were out of order, but they didn't inform guests and didn't provide assistance with a timely manner.","Beijing, China","Richun</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beijing, China</strong>",2,4.0

It took me a while to write a review but it's amazing how time flies. Pros: Proximity to beach -- you cross the street and you're there as well as shops, places to eat and drink, and ABC Stores (which is actually everywhere). The ground floor lobby is cool with the surfboards displayed on the wall. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The Tiki Bar and Restaurant has a great view of the beach front, the food was good not spectacular, and they have a live band playing although not everyday. The room was ocean view, not ocean front but when you sit in the balcony it didn't matter. I watched the surfers from sunrise to sunset and the people walking up and down Kalakaua. On New Year's Day, one of the hotels had fireworks which was quite enjoyable. It was a comfortable room, with a small fridge and nice flat screen tv. The wi-fi was decent. They have a gaming system (a PS3 I think) which you can also use to play DVDs. They give you a Video card for the kiosk to rent movies and presumably games (I don't play video games so I didn't notice) for free. The disks are returned at the same place. Unreturned items are charged to your room. Cons: The air conditioner was not working properly. The thermostat could not be set by the guest. It was set at 62 which is 10 degrees colder than I prefer so it was very difficult to sleep for 3 nights in a row. I didn't spend that much time in the room so it was by the 4th day I finally called housekeeping to make it warmer. The doors to the balcony opens but being on the lower floors, the street noise was loud but quieted down by 10pm.","Pittsburg, California","SeeTheWorld173</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pittsburg, California</strong>",2,3.0

Perhaps that's enough for some visitors. It is located near the east end of Kalakaua Ave., right across the beach from Waikiki. There are no hotels on the beach at this end of Waikiki, so beach access is wonderful. The hotel, however, is a dog, which is surprising due to Aston's reputation. Rooms are old, crowded, and in need of TOTAL makeovers. The check-in process involves waiting in a queue. Heaven help if you need to use the restroom near the front counter; it's key-card entry only. You can't get your card, however, until you've made it through the queue. Next, the elevators involve a unique, key-card process of calling an elevator to your specific floor. Strange, to say the least. Most rooms have an ocean view from small, private balconies. Our slider worked fine. Our friends, in room 811, couldn't get their slider open and had to call for maintenance. Thankfully, we only stayed one night as we were returning to the US from an international vacation. Any more and we'd have felt really cheated.Checkout: Don't be shocked by a $23 (plus tax) daily ""resort fee"". I asked what it covered and the desk clerk slid a sheet in front of me...access to in-room telephone, the resort swimming pool, pool towels, $10 breakfast coupon, etc. Think what you'd be paying if you stayed here a week. Do the math...ouch! Final injustice: $2.00 charge for each plastic key-card you don't return. I've never, never heard of this charge. Aston is really looking under the rug for every possible revenue stream. Overall, there are over 70 other hotels in Waikiki. Aston Waikiki Beach is near the bottom of the list, from our experience.","Seattle, Washington","tghiemstra</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",78,1.0

The desk gave us the key and called out building maintenance, I returned to the door the second keycard did not work so we waited for the maintenance guy who of course go the card to work on the first try. The my wife tried the card and again it would not work so we had to spend the next 15 minutes getting checked out on the proper way to slide a keycard into the door in order to get the thing to work (and yes there is a specific way to do this for the Astons old locks). I also had booked an ocean view that turned into a partial ocean/ mountain / top of a building view but for one night I let it go. Once we got all that sorted out the kids wanted to head to the pool for swimming that was closed and roped off when we got there (the sun wasn’t even down yet) and already exhausted from the door fiasco we just moved on to the beach.

For the price, you cannot beat the Oceanfront Select room views of the beach, Diamond Head and Waikiki. Other hotels this close to the beach, with this view would be much more expensive. The hotel is within easy walking distance of everything - the beach, restaurants, the zoo, the aquarium, all of Waikiki. The staff is friendly and professional. The room was good, two clean, comfortable double beds, a refrigerator with complementary drinks, an adequate bathroom, free Wi-Fi. The bathroom showed the wear from the many guests and was in need of some minor maintenance. The A/C kept the room comfortable, but the thermostat was not functional. Initially it would not work at all. Upon notifying the front desk, a maintenance person quickly arrived and replaced the thermostat. After replacement, it would go on or off manually, but not automatically, which was a slight annoyance, but no big deal. Valet parking is mandatory and adds $30 a day to the cost.

The rooms are quaint and had undergone some recent paint and some new touch-ups. My guess is that you won't be spending too much time in your room anyhow, right? The beds are super comfy and each morning awoke refreshed! There is a gift shop on the lower floor where you can get anything from snacks to soft drinks to souvenirs to liquor. We didn't see if the hotel offered room service, however don't fret there are dozens upon dozens of places to eat right on the main street which the hotel is located on. Everything from fast food to upscale dining; you're covered. The hotel has a bar ""Tiki's""which is often loud, crowded and fun, a great place to unwind, listen to live music and have a great mai tai! The hotel pool is nice, clean, kid friendly and you'll get pool towels too. Interested in watching a DVD in your room, you'll get access to free DVD and PS4 game rentals in the lobby; a great touch! Plus, when you arrive you receive a care package that includes assorted sun tan lotions and hand fans; a nice touch. There are numerous ""tour operators"" downstairs that offer hundreds of things to do while in Oahu. They will even pick you up at the hotel! Note; some attractions are actually ""free"", so what you're paying for is the bus transportation and the driver telling you about interesting details on your way to that location. Example, The USS Arizona Memorial is free. If you have a car, drive there early yourself as they give away approx 2,000-2,500 tickets away for free. We paid $100 each and took the bus, go figure.

It was clean, the amenities were very reasonable, and the staff was very nice.The ocean view room we initially paid for, ended up being way too small. I informed the front desk, Chris, and he let me look at two other rooms. Ultimately the room we choose was more expensive, but he was able to get the price down to where it was affordable. He did this for us even though the desk was slammed with checkins. You pay a daily resort fee, but I was impressed with what you get. Unlimited movie and video game check out privileges. The movie selections are similar to what Red Box will have. There is a PlayStation 3 in the room, along with a Keurig. You get coupons for $10 off breakfast for each person in your room, at Tiki's, the hotel restaurant. They also have beach chairs and towels for check out.The hotel is located directly across the street from the beach. The beach has a wall to keep the surf out and has a sandy bottom. Nice place to let the kids go free and not worry about them getting sucked out to sea. There is an equipment rental place on the south side of the beach, you can get boogie boards, SUP's, umbrellas, etc.There is a Wolfgang Pucks and Subway on the street level.

You will pay $27 a day for valet. There is no where else to park nearby. The valet named Bartz, is a heck of a nice guy and very helpful. The local trolley's stop by the front along with taxis.

We dutifully waited until after check-in time, but of course our room wasn't ready. The restrooms in the lobby require a key card to enter. So, you need to go to the restroom but first have to wait in line to check in, then can't get a key because your room is not ready, so you have to wait more time for your keys and still can't get into restroom. The front desk staff was a very nice lady but completely unhelpful. She told us we could enjoy the hotel amenities while we waited (except the restroom, which requires a key). When I asked what amenities, she said the pool or we could rent a DVD or PS3 game or go to their bar/grill ""Tiki's"". (We had already eaten at Tiki's, where I ordered strawberry pancakes for $16 that had absolutely NO strawberries.)When I asked if there was a changing room for the pool, she told me no, you have to use the restroom. That would be adequate if I had a key to get into it!! And a DVD does me no good if I don't have anything to play it on. The TV/DVD player being in the room I can't get into. There is absolutely NO seating in the lobby. You can sit by the pool with your luggage (in the rain, in our case) while you wait for your room to be made up. The elevator system is so screwed up I will not try to describe it. The rooms are small. Decor is outdated. The bathroom tile is old and cracked. The tub looked dirty. There were two sets of towels for a family of four. We called for more and they were never delivered. There were no glasses in the bathroom, only two coffee mugs in the entire room. The mini bar contained no alcohol, just an assortment of bizarre snacks. Beds were comfortable. The only seating was a bar-high small table with two stools. We were lucky to have a small lanai with two chairs and an amazing view of the beach. I put out the ""do not disturb"" sign and the maid knocked THREE separate times!! On checking out, we stored our luggage as we had a night flight. The bell captain opened the door for us and made us go in back and stack our own luggage.

The views we had from our room and the Hotel's location were fantastic. The Hotel is obviously not a 5 star resort and people should take that into account. We were fortunate enough and appreciative to receive an upgrade to a Level 25 Ocean View Select room. The rooms are not huge, those with 2 children [like us] may find it a tad squashy. They are clean and neat but sadly are probably in need of few little touch-ups. Its a tricky scenario trying to renovate a hotel that is in reasonable condition. We did have a few minor issues with TV, Air-Con and Phone that management did their best to address. We really did not spend much time in our rooms as the beach opposite is amazing. The pool on site is not the biggest, but is always clean and tidy [but was sadly in the shade for most of the day on this visit]  The Resort Fees don't have much to offer besides the Wi-Fi [which wasn't too bad] and the DVD/Games hire. Sadly, the mad rush for breakfast has been replaced by a sun-care pack which we didn't even open. This is one area that maybe management could add more value to? Tiki's Grill isn't one of our favourites and we ate most meals elsewhere. Wolfgang Puck's Express on Ground floor is quite good for a quick quality casual meal.The Expedia Travel office in the Lobby is fantastic with helping with your Holiday needs. We found a great car-hire deal through them [A convertible car is a must for all other Aussies] Its tricky to recommend this Hotel. Yes it is quite good [IF you get it at a good rate and an Upgrade] otherwise you will most probably find better options in that price range. We have seen the standard drop a little but that has nothing to do with the efforts of the staff and management. There were so many more positives than negatives in this most recent stay and its tricky trying to just point out the smaller bad points. Its not as far away from the centre of Waikiki as some people might think and the Kuhio breakwall Beach opposite is probably the best in the area.

The room very comfy with full cable tv and a high stool dining table. The bathroom however was more than a little disappointing.

That was a poor first impression. We booked under the Mahalo for Memories rate which came with partial ocean views and choice of opting for the resort fee which came with some amenities. We decided to skip the amenities for a fee and were glad we did. The next troubling experience was that reception did not have the rate conditions and we had to prove it by producing a printout of the email confirmation. We were glad we did but you would think a hotel of this reputation would have a handle on this. We were extremely disappointed that the Hotel offerred WiFi at the rooms for a charge, in this day and age, you would think WiFi is a given. Nevertheless we could access free WiFi around the reception area. The room was quite clean and had a very decent view of the Waikiki beach. The washroom was clean but quite dated, the tub did not drain properly. They kept a pouch with sunscreen spray and body lotions which I thought was a very good touch but then they spoilt that when I saw a charge for using the bottled water and coffee machine. Housekeeping was quite friendly and provided excellent service. The other shortcoming was that the Hotel did not provide for a public tea/coffee station so that customers could get their morning cup before going out for some of the early tours. We did couple of the inter island tours and had to leave early by around 5am. At this time, no cafes were open nearby and we ended up having breakfast at the airport, which was not too bad. Check-out was nice and easy. Overall we had a good stay at the hotel, they just need to iron out a few kinks. I would definitely recommend this hotel since it is located right across the beach with easy access to dining, shopping and of course the beach.

The King size bed was very comfortable and our room on level 23 was far away from most of the city noise below. The security system re the elevators makes sense. Unfortunately at US$225 a night the room was a little undersized, and as mentioned, the bathroom was tired, and really in serious need of a renovation.

We filled out all the paperwork and I asked if the desk could text us (as many hotels have a system for) when the room was ready and the person at the desk said they could but ""to be honest, I usually forget to do that"" so our best bet was to come back after 3. We went, had lunch, came back and had to wait in line all over again to get our room keys. It would be helpful if there was some sort of express line for guests/circumstances like this where we didn't need to go through the full check in. Geri helped us the second go-round and was very nice and helpful. Heads up - because I didn't realize this - they do charge not only a resort fee of $23 a day, which I knew, but also a parking fee of $27 a day and the only option is valet. I don't mind a valet but to only have that as an option, and to have it an additional $27 a day I feel is a bit much. Our room was fine, a bit small, but we got a king room as requested with a great view. The $23 a day gives you $10 vouchers toward Tiki's for breakfast. You can only use 1 per person per day, so no holding them over. Breakfast options start around $14-$16 each so you will still have to pay out of pocket for breakfast. There were protesters on our last full day there. We were on the 21st floor and heard them loud and clear with the door closed -- we were attempting a nap. From a google search, it appears this has been going on for a few months now. Again, just something to keep in mind. They have the right to do so, and it went on for over an hour. Loudly.The wi-fi was spotty and I kept dropping a connection so I ended up having to use my cellular data and create a hotspot. Again, it's an annoyance to pay a resort fee that includes free wi-fi when it doesn't work well.Overall, the hotel is showing age. Our room, the outlets were quite loose on the outlet strip under the coffee maker. There was only 1 other wall outlet in the bathroom. It was clean, and mostly quiet (except the protest) and it was in a good location, however it likely wouldn't be my first choice again due to the parking fees on top of the resort fees, and the age of the hotel.","Gilbert, Arizona","sandy6879</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gilbert, Arizona</strong>",27,3.0

The location is fantastic, Waikiki Beach is directly across the street. Fully worth the extra cost to have a Ocean View Room. I stayed here with my husband, brother and sister-in-law and parents. We had booked three rooms, but apparently they do not guarantee room types (just view), so my husband and I ended up in a room with two double beds. After calling down to the desk and waiting a VERY long time and speaking with multiple people, they did offer to move my husband and I, but we would have been away from the rest of our family, so we declined.Other reviews recommended requesting high floor to avoid street/traffic noise. We were in the top third of the hotel, and had no issue with noise.The daily breakfast was fine, and it was nice that they give you insulated lunch bags in your room, so you can stock up from breakfast. Our one issue with breakfast was the day we had an early morning tour pick up. Our pick up was before breakfast started, so we asked at the desk the day before - they told us, no problem, someone will be here, just ask, they can probably give you a muffin or yogurt to go. That was NOT the case the following morning - and we ended up rushing around to find food before our tour.The restaurant on site is good, has a great drinks menu and is nice for a late-night cocktail.After our stay we received an email survey, which I filled out. I outlined some of the issues we experienced, and someone from the hotel not only got back to me (I was shocked) but also offered to refund some of the upgrade fee (for the Ocean View Room). I was so surprised, and very, very pleased - I didn't think anyone actually followed up on those surveys.","Rockville, Maryland","Blueyeris</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rockville, Maryland</strong>",11,4.0

The furniture was a little dated but everything was clean, the matresses and pillows quite comfortable with crisp white sheets and the view of Waikiki Beach well, what can I say? The room had a large flatscreen TV, Playstation, coffeemaker and small refrigerator. The fridge wasn't working properly but they replaced it within a half hour of our call. They offer free movie rentals in the Lobby. Our stay included a ""Breakfast on the Beach"" insulated bag with fruit, danish, granola bar and coffee/juice that could be picked up from 6-9am each morning. I understand that they are phasing this service out. There are numerous places to eat all within walking distance. Location was great. Beach across the street, the Park and Zoo a block over and views of Diamond Head. Bus and trolley service is available right in front of the hotel.

They serve lunch, happy hour specials, and dinner. Open to the public. Food was tasty and not over priced. Note-this is not run by the hotel so you won't be able to charge your meals to the room.

In both cases we requested accommodation with the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel. This request was because of the prior experience. The hotel was very positive, the flight on Allegiant, not so much. The flight on Air Canada was much better, although the flight departure times could have been better. Now about the hotel, very clean very nice beds (for a relaxing sleep) and the housekeeping is very good indeed. You are supplied with the usual toiletries and plenty of clean towels. The room has a number niceties, such as a safe, small fridge, iron & ironing board, and a Keuriq coffee maker. The is a flat screen TV and the usual radio/clock combo. A room with the ocean view is nice, but there are so many combinations that are not explained that it is difficult to decide what may suit you.We requested the same room we had on our previous visit, and were told that this was a higher class and required an additional fee. When we stalled at that, we were told that if we called back before we arrived they may be able to offer and upgrade, due the fact we were previous guests. When we checked we were told that the request for the particular room was on file. When we arrived we were told the room “was not available” and we were given a room on a lower floor, still with an ocean view, but a considerably smaller balcony, with no chairs. (Hint: if booking a room try to get a higher floor - less street noise). You are not likely to spend a lot of time on the balcony, but it would be nice to have somewhere to sit.Speaking of seating, you do not have any chairs, so to speak. There is a table with two, very uncomfortable wooden benches. You may use the table for whatever but you won’t sit there too long. Should you wish to watch the TV, you’ll have to do that from the bed. Its not as if there isn’t any space for chairs, they just don’t supply them. I will admit you don’t spend a lot of time in your room, but having a reasonably comfortable chair would be nice. Replacing the benches with regular chairs would solve the problem (it would likely necessitate changing the table which is rather high).One of the main reasons for choosing the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel was something called a Breakfast on the Beach. This was a very positive feature of our previous visit. There isn’t much sense in describing it because it was cancelled prior to our arrival. There was no refund for the change, because it was replaced with something called “Grab & Go”. This certainly was nothing like “breakfast on the beach”, it consisted of an orange, a fibre bar and a pastry, coffee, tea and juice. Two days before we were to leave, the “Grab & Go” was cancelled, and replaced with a $10.00 voucher at Tiki’s Pub in the hotel. That actually turned out to be better than the Grab & Go. I would wonder how the hotel is going to handle future guests. Is there a plan to just cut out anything as a breakfast option?One truly annoying action, by many of the hotels in Hawaii, and we have found in Nevada (called a resort fee there) is the addition of an “amenity” fee. This is to pay for the items normally free at hotels throughout the US & Canada, items such as WiFi (which incidentally is spotty and generally a weak signal), in room coffee maker, in room safe, newspaper, unlimited movies and PS3 games, local and 800 calls and the fitness center. They don’t mention the hotel swimming pool and the loan of towels for the beach, but that may be then next addition to the amenity listing. When you pay for a package deal for a holiday, you don’t really plan on the fact the day you leave, you get a bill under the door, for the amenity fee of $23.00 a day plus tax. Wouldn’t you think they could just jack the room price up by $23.00 a day, plus tax?If you are in the habit of forgetting to turn your key in, that will be $10.00 each please. Also a nice hotel feature is glass glasses and coffee mugs. But don’t think about taking a mug with you, that will be added to your credit card ($10.00 each).  If you rent a car, where do you park it? The hotel will charge you $27.00 a day parking, which includes valet service(you can’t park yourself). There is an excellent bus system throughout the Island, and plenty of alternatives to renting a car. It is rush hour for most of the day and evening, something else to think about.What’s the bottom line here - the hotel is probably in the best location in Waikiki. Across from the beach, close to everything within walking distance. The bus stops are very close to connect to just about anyplace you might want to visit on the Island. If the hotel were to straighten out their problems with the addition of a breakfast option as part of the hotel charges, we think this would be a very good choice when choosing accommodation in Waikiki. Otherwise you might want to check out other hotels in TripAdvisor. Yes I would recommend this hotel.","Summerland, Canada","Peter M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Summerland, Canada</strong>",36,4.0

Our partial ocean view king was actually nice and overlooked the pool and the beach. The staff at the front desk and our housekeeper were very attentive and helped make our stay pleasant. However, the pics on their site do not show the worn condition of this property. The bathroom was small and had missing or broken tiles and initially the tub was not draining well (however once we alerted the front desk, it was fixed immediately). The room also had no available power outlets next to the bedside tables, meaning we had to charge our electronics on the drawers/hidden minibar/fridge. Another quirk is the AC always was set at 65, but we knew it was nowhere near even 70 -- thankfully it was still cooler than outside. But my biggest pet peeve was the mandatory valet parking. Two different occasions we called down for the car to be brought up, only to have to go to the valet stand to ask for the car 15min later to see that they didn't even retrieve the keys to get the car. At one point, we were getting so late for a dinner, we had to ride in another valeted care to where our car was parked and we drove our car from the valet garage ourselves!!! I'm sure that was against the rules, but it seemed ridiculous especially since it wasn't a busy time and there didn't seem to me many people waiting for cars or dropping cars off. This hotel will continue to be popular mainly because of the position of being across the beach. My hope is that if they want to increase their prices to be almost the same as the international chain next door, it had better be reflected in the upgrades.","Portland, Oregon","BeATraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",57,3.0

The beach itself will mesmerize you. If you are there with a partner, you may fall in love all over again. It is just that amazing! As for this hotel, the pool attendant on our first day (Thursday 10-15)had the attitude of a poorly paid office temp worker. He really should find other employment, because frankly, customer service is not his thing. On the other hand, the front desk staff was helpful and assisted us with a room change after the first day ( our shower overflowed incessantly due to a design flaw, thus necessitating a room change so as not to flood us out of the room).The central air conditioning in our room did not seem to cool at times- not sure what the cause was or if it was pre set by staff. Lastly, the pool did not look inviting at all. It had a lime green hue to it ( not to mention it was full of kids- um no thanks! )I would say that you can find a better option in the area. If you get this hotel for a good price, by all means consider it. I just think that for a bit more you can have a much better experience elsewhere. PS: there is no breakfast buffet.

While the staff was willing to let us switch rooms, we looked at 4 other rooms that were no better in comparison and not worth the hassle of re-packing all of our stuff and moving. Plus, while looking at other rooms we could hear the neighbors next door, so, at least where we were it was quiet. But the bathroom and balcony were literally falling apart. The second most disappointing thing was to find out about the discontinuation of the free breakfast. What they did give us was very mediocre. Apparently it is going away entirely.

Expensive, we were prepared to pay the fee, based on our past experiance, for the breakfast buffet and morning entertainment but now that's gone. I'd say BUDGET CUTBACKS, and the daily fee hasn't dropped with the drop in services either!- the suits/rooms have had the wall behind the bed heads painted but as other have mentioned, the air conditioners struggle (we couldn't alter the temperature of our last couple rooms) and the plumbing was blocking in our room, so agreed with others, the rooms need a revamp but again they have a lovely view.... The staff did move us to a new room after we asked after our noisy air conditioning unit this last trip.... But in Australia this would be a 3.5 star hotel.I hope this fairly impartial summary helps as we have a soft spot for the place but it is waning.","Brisbane Region, Australia","David R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane Region, Australia</strong>",3,3.0

The hotel is just across the road from the beach and easy walking distance to all the shops, but is in need of a complete refurb. I would rate it to be the equivalent of a hotel you would pay around $100 in Australia for. We were shown four different rooms before we found a room which we were happy with and I have to say that Geri in Reception who assisted us, was very obliging and helpful, couldn't have been nicer.There was a coffee machine in the room, no milk and no instructions! The bed was very comfortable, but the rooms are very small and dated.All properties in Honolulu are completely smoke-free so for those who want to smoke, the area allocated at this hotel is out on the side-walk where people are walking past all the time waving the smoke away, in the hot sun or rain whatever the case may be, much easier not to smoke!The one great thing about this property is the elevator system, there is absolutely no waiting time. You just swipe your room card and key in the floor you are going to and a display tells you which lift to take (there are six lifts from memory,) and usually the lift is there almost immediately, it's a great system.This hotel didn't meet our expectations, for $300+ per night we felt it was over-priced and over-rated.","Melbourne, Australia","AnnetteMonty</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",45,3.0

I knew not to expect anything for breakfast, so that wasn't a surprise (it does sort of suck to have to pay the same amenities fee that there was when we booked our reservation that included a great hot breakfast buffet- now you get a muffin (not fresh), banana or apple, and a granola bar. Juices and coffee as well.The good: Location, of course. 5 min walk to the beach, surrounded by popular shops and restaurants/bars. I was actually pleasantly surprised with some of the room, small yes, no chair (there are 2 bar stools) to sit on, but the beds and linens are new (read some horror stories about hairs/stains/bugs in the bed). The pool was small, but perfect for our 5 year old after being tossed around all day at the beach. We enjoyed the free movie rentals, though sparse, there were some good titles. Full cable was nice too. Beach chair and towel rental was great for the pool area and beach. Our rooms had absolutely no cooling issues- in fact we froze and had to request additional blankets. Not a problem in my book :) I enjoyed having the Keurig in the room, and Starbucks downstairs of course.The bad: I will say that the bathrooms are pretty gross- we had connecting rooms and both were really bad. Broken tiles, dozens of random different hairs not only on the floor, but mostly the walls and countertops. I requested that the bathroom be cleaned again upon my arrival and they maybe got 2 of the god knows how many other hairs. The carpet is very dark and boldly patterned, so I have no idea about the cleanliness of that. There were tiny bugs crawling in the bathroom on the floor and coming out of the drain in the sink. The blowdryers are useless, only blow very lightly and very cool air. The lanai was a small maybe 2 ft by 4 ft space, no chairs or room for them. Not that we'd spend much time in the room anyways, but unless you're planning to just be gone all the time, you're not going to find a chair to relax in. I suppose you could sit on the bed.We check out in a few days- I will not book this hotel again, nor will I recommend it. While it's a screamin' deal based on location, I would very happily pay more to stay elsewhere, or stay a bit further off the beach for something that is actually clean..buyer beware of course.","Denver, Colorado","JamesonsMommy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",5,3.0

The resturant in the hotel was great. Here you had great views of the beach, sunset & fireworks (on the weekend).

We always just left the cooler in our room and ate breakfast by the pool, since we were hopping on a shuttle for some excursion or another. The staff were friendly and helpful. There are kiosks off the lobby staffed by local tour companies to help you book any kind of excursion you'd care to try. We booked a dinner cruise to celebrate our anniversary, and it was a nice experience. We appreciated the second-floor lobby and keycard access to the elevators.

Disappointingly so, we will not be returning to the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel for our next visit to Honolulu. A significant reason we liked this hotel was because of the ""breakfast on the beach"", which was not incredible, but enough food to last us until a late morning snack or lunch. This time around, we found out not through the hotel itself, advising us that they had eliminated ""breakfast on the beach"", but instead through TripAdvisor that they switched over to a grab and go style breakfast which consisted of a piece of fruit, a small pastry and a Quaker's chewy chocolate chip granola bar. As a young couple, we saved and budgeted for this vacation but having to tack on an extra meal to pay for (as the grab and go is not nearly satisfying) for the entirety of the trip is a significant expense… in addition to the $24 amenity fee that includes the 'breakfast'. One morning we even woke up (at 6 AM) to the hotel employees loudly protesting. A silent protest would have been equally as effective and much less bothersome to guests who paid $145+/night to stay there. Throughout the duration of our stay, we found 2 cockroaches in our room, which was also unpleasant. Just small features they offered last year that weren't offered this year were missed - live entertainment at breakfast hour by the pool, or coffee/tea available at all hours, neither of which are available now.

The registration staffer gave me a better rate than anything I saw online, and much better than our original “not on Waikiki beach” place. For having stayed on Waikiki Beach, in Hawaii, viewing the beach, on a holiday weekend, I feel like I got a great deal. The room was very nice and comfortable, and more than adequate as a base of operations for everything we did on Oahu. All the staff were great; special thanks to the valet staff, who were extra busy because of a local event/festival, and still always came through for us quickly. Great view of the beach. BE AWARE – after seeing sites that were east of Waikiki (Hanauma Bay, etc.), Google Maps would plot a return path to the hotel through residential areas, including a horrible left turn (no light) across 4 lanes of busy traffic, with poor visibility. Instead of exiting at 26, go down another mile to 25.

Having paged through countless reviews, photographs, maps, and any bit of information that could possibly be provided, we finally decided upon the Aston Waikiki Beach. We had chosen a partial ocean view suite, not only because the photographs on the web site made the room look perfect, though also because the price was completely within our price range. After a very long flight, a very long taxi ride from the airport and checking in (which too was long, though we had arrived just as a bus load of guest did also, so the wait was to be expected), we entered our room and were greeted by the most spectacular view of Waikiki Beach that I would imagine is possible. Our suite, situated on the 24th floor, was spacious, immaculately clean, and very up to date. In addition to a king size bed, the room also boasted a spacious living-room complete with a large couch, coffee table, end tables, 42 inch flat screen television, bar table with 2 stools and refrigerator. Leading out to the dual balconies are 2 large sliding glass doors, and each balcony is furnished with a chair, ottoman and small table. A large closet near the door provides ample space for anything you might bring and need to hang, as well as an ironing board, iron, two kimono’s and a safe. The king size bed and pillows were more than comfortable and provided perfect sleep for our entire visit. The staff was overly accommodating in every aspect of our stay, in fact there was not one question that was not answered immediately, nor one request not met with the full enthusiasm of the hotel staff. In addition to the hotel is Tiki’s, a full service restaurant and bar with a perfect ocean view, small gift store with everything one might need during a stay, Wolfgang Pucks, a full valet service and local travel agents to assist in making arrangements for tours and transportation. The hotel is within easy walking distance to the public beaches (simply crossing the road) and many shops and restaurants. Our stay at the Aston was as perfect as we could have ever hoped for and this is one of the true hotel gems I have come across.","Robertsville, Missouri","ReginaUsher</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Robertsville, Missouri</strong>",3,4.0

I saved hundreds per night over the other hotels, some of which were not as well located or as well appointed. The view from our room was wonderful. You have to pay daily fees for parking and in room features, but I found that true of pretty much everywhere I checked. The fee charges seemed standard. My daughter and I enjoyed dinner at the bar.

If you were to walk 100m from the hotel lobby your feet would be covered in sand and probably be up to your waist in water!For our 10 days in Hawaii we spent the first 4 nights at the Aston before heading up the north shore.

The staff informed us that our room had already been vacated so they would have it made up straight away and if we were happy to return in an hour they could check us in then.-We also received a gift pack of sunscreen, water, snacks, etc on our arrival which was a nice touch.-Staff were extremely helpful, rooms were cleaned to a high standard and always done before lunch time.-The pool has a nice shady deck in the forenoon and plenty of umbrellas for shade in the afternoon-Included in the resort fee is a picnic style breakfast. The hotel supply you with a cooler bag on arrival, then each morning they have tables set up at the pool area to supply you with a goody bag (usually a piece of fruit, museli bar and some sort of pastry, per person) as well as coffee/tea/juice.Other points to note...-Weird thing about the balcony was that there was only one chair and one footrest, even though it was a 2 person room, plenty of room on the balcony if they got rid of the foot rest and just put two chairs.-The pool isn't key card protected at all, and given it's close proximity to the beach, it could mean that non hotel guests could also be using the pool.-We had a 'partial ocean view room' but it was a lot more than partial, pretty much full view up Waikiki beach to the west.-The elevator system is a bit strange (have to pre select level, no buttons inside to select multiple levels) and at 1500 check-in time, they get extremely busy and you could be waiting a while, but I guess this is the case at any hotel at that time of day.",,Kelsie W,2,5.0

To start things off - the location of the hotel was great. The beach was a street cross away and scenery was a view to die for. Convenience was a huge plus, with all the food and shopping options nearby. The main concern that arose during our stay was the amenity charge, which includes: Breakfast, WIFI, television channels, and movies. The charge alone was the only real gripe we had with our stay with Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel. Half the channels were skipping, most of the movies were not working, and the WIFI connection was horrid. We called for the tv connection to be serviced and was told by the engineer it was the channels that was causing the issue and that was that. We did not want to spend too much time trying to re-mediate these issues during our stay. We totally understand that a vacation in Hawaii should be spent out and about, but if we are charged to pay that amount for amenities, I expect the quality to reflect the price. We voiced our concerns at checkout and our rep Geri was very helpful, but not much could be done with the daily amenity charges. I do not believe our expectations for the amenities to be unreasonable. With that said, I would still recommend Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel if you find the amenity charge to be a trivial thing.","Los Angeles, California","A K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",3,3.0

These were the best two things about the hotel, the view and the distance to the beach. It is also a convenient location for tour pick ups. We went on several tours and pick was always right outside. They also have a DVD rental system which was neat as well. We went to Tiki's a few times. The food was okay and drinks were good.

As a result, we received a nice discount on our room costs but nothing in Honolulu is cheap, even with a discount. Plus the AWB is an easy and convenient drive to the UHM campus. The AWB staff was friendly, polite, attentive and welcoming. I noticed many guests with an AWB tote bag and when I inquired about them, the front desk staff handed me one. The valet parking staff was courteous and offered some good local suggestions for places to eat. The valet staff was quite accommodating, but the parking area is crazy hectic in the early morning and at dinner time. Thankfully, there are comfortable sofas and a TV to watch while you wait for your car. Breakfast is served beginning at 6:30am; however, coffee was out when I came down about 6:00am. Coffee and breakfast are served on the pool deck. Breakfast is a brown bag that includes a muffin/pastry, fruit, and a protein snack. Quick and simple but not necessarily filling. AWB has two dining options: Wolfgang Puck and the Tiki Grill and we ate at both several times. The Tiki Grill offers a seafood based menu and the purple dinner rolls were a novelty. Strange looking but they tasted like a regular dinner roll. The wait staff advised the rolls were made with taro root which is considered a sacred food on the island. After a hot, humid day of moving my student into the dorm at UH, my dinner consisted of a basket of purple rolls and a most delicious and refreshing watermelon/feta salad. The Wolfgang Puck option was not a fancy, white-table cloth restaurant. It was a quick dine-in or take-out that offered pizza, salads, pasta, etc. Waikiki Beach was across the street from the AWB. We had an ocean front room and the view was breathtaking. The balconies was very close and you could have easily shaken the hand of your neighbor on the next balcony. Our rooms was clean and adequate but not luxurious. There were sufficient reading lamps for both beds. The room refrigerator was stocked with gratis items but the items were not typical for mainland tastes - coconut water, agave juice, etc. The bathroom was small but it was clean and offered appropriate amenities. There was an in-room safe. The AWB did not have a business center, so if I needed to use a computer (a screen bigger than my smartphone), the AWB staff suggested I visit the Marriott Hotel Business Center. However, the AWB staff did say they could print airline boarding passes for me; however, I was not inclined to give them my login information. The room provided an in-room safe and WiFi was free. The elevators in the AWB were unique. You placed your room card in front of the reader and then the screen told you which lettered elevator to catch. If you caught the wrong elevator, it did not stop at your floor. There were no buttons inside the elevator to select the floor on which you wished to stop. This approach certainly added a strong security component; however, it took some adjusting to. Most of my time was spent on the UH campus; however, I had no complaints about the AWB. It was a good value for the money; it was across from the beach with awesome views; and it was within walking distance of many restaurants and stores; and the staff was professional and friendly. I will likely be back at the AWB when my student graduates from UH in May 2019 (hopefully).","Richmond, Virginia","abc1129</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Virginia</strong>",30,4.0

There are something like 26 stories of rooms. Our room was decently spaced, had a nice soft bed and clean bathroom. There is a balcony that overlooks the pool and part of the Pacific. I found staff at the hotel to be very nice and accommodating. The grab and go breakfast usually consisted of a muffin, a snack bar, and a piece of fruit. Fortunately, they did have self serve coffee and juices as well. They give you a cooler that you can pack with your breakfast and then dash across the street to the beach. By weeks end we were quite tired of the muffins. I think that it would have been better to serve other things. I would've liked yogurt or eggs or peanut butter added to the grab and go breakfast. When I got to Hawaii, I had already paid for my airfare and hotel or so I thought. Another thing that I was not expecting was the $27 a day parking fee as well as a $23 a day amenity fee. Included in this amenity fee, was Wi-Fi and movies to rent as well as ""complementary"" coffee in the rooms. I suppose that somewhere in the fine print it was mentioned, but it was not apparent until I was signing in for my room. Overall, I probably would not book in the Ashton Waikiki Beach Hotel again. I probably would look for something with a kitchenette so that I can make my own breakfast and save $23 a day in amenity fees. If you do book here, make sure you know how much it cost to park per day as well as other hidden fees. I wouldn't have minded them so much had I known about them beforehand.

The room we had on the eighth floor had a king bed as requested and was very clean and serviced daily. The view overlooking the pool and beach was great and the lift service was very efficient. The only down side was the bathroom which was clean but very out dated. We found the staff friendly and ready to help with our enquiries such as confirming our activities for the next day. The breakfasts were very basic with your choice being cereal,yoghurt,fruit, pastries etc and seating was very basic and you had to be early to reserve a table. This was a minor fault as most people decided to go back to their room or go over the road and eat on the beach as guests were supplied with cooler bags to transport their meal. Talking to some people who stayed in other hotels we feel we made the right choice as one couple paid the same price as us but did not even have air conditioning and did not have the room serviced while they were there. One week. I guess if we decided to stay at the Hilton or other up market hotels we would have better meals etc.but for the money difference i would rather spend it on tours or shopping but we were totally happy with the choice we made and if we go back to Hawaii we would stay at the same hotel.

We arrived the same time as a bus load of JAL air crew. We couldn't see the fancy lift system for all the people standing in front of the panels and ended up going on a wild goose chase trying to find reception and stuck in a lift with no buttons. We are a family of 4 so we asked for 2 double beds on booking. On check-in we were informed there were no rooms with double beds available and the best they could do was offer one rollaway (2 kids). So one kid ended up sleeping on the floor with a towel for a blanket cos he was getting frustrated sharing a single with his bed hog brother. There is no additional bedding in the room. The room itself was nice. It was clean, spacious and we had spectacular views from the 10th floor oceanfront. The bathroom is old and basic but it was clean. WIFI didn't work. Signal strength was too poor. I mentioned it at check-out and was refunded the amenities fee. The kids enjoyed swimming in the pool although basic and it was easy to get a lounger. The tiles around the pool area/reception are extremely slippery when wet. I saw 3 ladies fall over in the one day we were there.The kids were stoked with their gift bags with bucket and spade and colouring in book. In the morning we headed down to Breakfast on the Beach only to discover we didn't get the ticket for it. I'm not sure if that wasn't included in our room rate or was an oversight. Either way I didn't bother following up as it didn't look very impressive. Muffin and a banana by the looks of it. Upon leaving we waited about 45 minutes for our car to be brought around. It was bedlam. In the end the valet gave us our keys and lead us out the back to where the car was parked surrounded by giant piles of old mattresses. That must be where all the double beds went. I would possibly stay here again given the great location. I'm not sure. While helpful, none of the staff seemed very happy and I think that says a lot. If this place was run a little better it would make a great value hotel.","Waialua, Hawaii","Trooly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waialua, Hawaii</strong>",8,3.0

Breakfast: Included (yogurt, cereal, muffins and different other breads, miso soup,fruit, juices, milk and coffe). You have other options available for more money not sure but it was about 5 extra dlls. There are not enough tables at the pool area to enjoy your open air breakfast, so you may want to go bac to your room or eat at the beach. DO NOT FORGET TO GET YOUR COMPLIMENTARY COOLER since you are definitely going to need it to carry anything you want to eat.The room was absolutely clean, I really enjoyed mi stay there for 6 nights. The rooms are in good shape, we asked for a king size bed and we got it. Small fridge was available but no microwave. You have a keurig coffee maker but coffee and water are not for free.The location was great. You can walk to Diamond Head, a lot of different restaurants around for any budget. As a tip, we enjoyed several dinners at Lulu's bar & Grill.The beach is just accross the street and is really good for families with children since there is seawall that allow young kids to be at the beach snorkeling and playing.Only downside was the reception, the guy was on the phone and he ignored us for about 10 mins while we wait in line for check in.","El Paso, Texas","PPCancun</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>El Paso, Texas</strong>",31,4.0

Had it been disclosed earlier, I'd have given hotel a 3. Were there an option to decline the fee, the hotel would get a 4.Now for the good: * This hotel has a great location, with an awesome view from all rooms; its architecture is really convenient * The package deal that we got was not that expensive, considering the neighborhood.* Valet parking is $27 a day, which is - believe it or not - quite OK, given the location and traffic* Beach towels for free - this is a big thing, very important to know ahead of time, so you don't pack your own, these things can be bulky.The bad: * $23 amenity fee - not sure if this is normal, but it feels like a total scam. It was only disclosed to us at check-in, and of course I had no options other than to agree to it. Let me mention some of the ""amenities"" that you get for that: local and 800 calls (normally free), in-room safe, use of coffee maker, daily paper ... see where I'm going?* we are a family of 4, we paid for 4, I disclosed there were 4 of us - yet somehow we always got 2 towels in the bathroom, so I had to call them up every day to bring 2 more. Is it that hard to have a note about the number of people in the room? * even when service lady did the room service while we were there, and saw there are 4 people in the room, she managed to give us only 2 towels. She did not speak English, so it wasn't enough to say ""may I have 2 more towels, please"", because she did not get it.* as I said, we were 4, and we dutifully paid the amenity fee, yet we always got 2 coffees (I know, the management would now say it's hotel policy to give you 2 coffees, but it's my policy to give reviews when I'm nickel and dimed)* breakfast - note to hotel management - please do not call this ""breakfast"". Call it ""complimentary poolside morning snack with watered-down fruit juice"" and I'll accept it. I wonder if hotel managers have such ""breakfast"" at home before they come to work.The ugly:* smoke detector went off the first night, right when we were totally asleep.

Do not pay any attention to the reviews talking about a cooler left in the room for you to fill up - that no longer exists as of yesterday.

As soon as we got back home from our trip to Hawaii, before even going inside my house I had to take my family to the doctors, I was very sick for over two weeks after returning from my trip, I had to have a double round of antibiotics, creams and antihistamines to fix the bites I received.I have been back home for five weeks now and the hotel have not sent an apology or contacted us at all, I have sent a couple of emails and they have just ignored me. This hotel knew we were bitten before we left and they knew what was in our room, I believe they had an obligation to let us know what was in our room and never did.For the amount of money you pay to stay you should not be exposed to such filth!

Their hotels insurance company has once emailed me to ask only for my medicare number and have never recontacted me again, this insurance company would have verified all claims but still no response from them. We have still had no contact from the hotel either. The only thing they reply to, is replying to comments on this site. They try to down play the problem that exists in their hotel, if you read other travellers comments it wasn’t just my room other levels also had problems. The number of bites my family and I received wasn’t a small problem of a few bugs coming in by previous travellers as they stated previously, these bugs must have been there a while and constantly multiplying to receive the bites we did.

We had kids with us so the hotel was perfect as right across was a walled portion of the beach, making it ideal for young children. There were several restaurants on the ground level including Wolfgang Puck. Parking was a hit and miss. It could be very busy and so bring a lot of patience when you have a rental car.

And what a good decision that was. I booked about 10 months ahead, ocean front select room and requested a high floor, which we received. Arrived at HNL around 1pm, we were at the hotel by 2pm and our room was ready by 2:45. Very nice staff at the front desk. The view is amazing. Loved seeing the sun set over the ocean every day of our vacation. The room was nice and clean. Two double beds and standard hotel bathroom that was clean and stocked with toiletries daily. The housekeeping staff was always friendly. The elevator system is easy to use and very efficient. I have to say the only time there was any wait, i.e. more than 3 minutes, was during the breakfast rush hours. Ok, so about the breakfast on the beach deal that is included with the amenity fee. There was plenty to choose from, mainly carbs in the form of pastries, fruit, yogurt, various juices and coffee/tea. It was a great way to start the day in a convenient location. We also brought the breakfast up to our room to enjoy the view and avoid the crowds. The hotel's location is superb. Across from the beach and close to the park/zoo, restaurants, public transportation, etc.It was great to be able to walk from the pool area to the beach and vice-versa in about 2 minutes. Ok, so this might not be a fancy enough hotel for many, but for us it had everything we needed and the price was good. I'm looking forward to returning to Waikiki and this hotel. I just hope it won't be another 5 years before that happens. ",chicago,"rebianco1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>chicago</strong>",26,5.0

The Hotel itself was nice and clean. The staff were quite indifferent. No real customer service that stood out. They did what was expected of their job and nothing more. Our towel rack in the bathroom was damaged from the moment we checked into our room and by the time we left, we weren't able to hang our towels, as housekeeping constantly hung new towels on it until it nearly collapsed. The hotel is located at the end of the main strip, near the zoo. This wasn't really a problem, but we had to walk to get to the main part of Waikiki, where all the designer shops were and where there was more variety for dining. What lets this hotel down and really turned my family and I off was the breakfast. Breakfast is included in your daily charges that you have to pay. We didn't do breakfast every day and following is the reason why. You were supplied in your room with 2 small soft eskis. I thought they were to store your cold drinks for your use at the beach. No - they were for your breakfast. You would go downstairs to level 3 for breakfast near the pool. Breakfast consisted of yogurt in little containers, 4 types of cereals in little boxes, miso soup, pastries, fruit, tea, coffee and juices. This was the problem - you needed to pack all this in your Eski. Lots of rubbish - paper bags for pastries and styrofoam cups for your milk for your cereal, for your juice and your coffee/tea and styrofoam bowls for cereal and fruit. Plus plastic spoons, knives and forks. Lots of rubbish for breakfast. I kept thinking how much rubbish is thrown out at this hotel every morning? Not very eco friendly. It was also very hard to find tables to sit down and eat. And there was no toast. Can't believe they didn't supply toast! Too bad if you didn't want anything sweet to eat. I felt it was a very 'tacky' breakfast. Aside from the issue of breakfast and the distance, it was a reasonable hotel. The dvd hire was a hit with the kids. Having the beach across the road was a bonus too. I'm sure the views would be great if you had ocean views. ",Melbourne,"HelenK43</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",32,3.0

The Aston Waikiki is in a great location, literally right across the street from the beach. The rooms (or our room at least) are not very updated but we did not spend much time there. The room was very spacious and clean and had a decent view of the ocean, but a spectacular view of Diamond Head and overlooked the Honolulu Zoo. The wi-fi was not reliable. We had maintenance come and re-set it, but that did not last more than one day. The morning breakfast is served poolside and consists of very basic items. No plates or utensils are provided and if you want to take something out of the pool area a small soft-sided cooler is provided. We skipped the offered breakfast most mornings. The one MAJOR complaint would be the parking situation. ALL parking is valet. There is no problem with that, however, we did not learn of the $27 PER DAY valet parking fee until we received the check out bill under our door the morning we were leaving. Not a single word was said the day we arrived with the car and there was no sign in the drive-thru area indicating there would be a fee. The hotel already charges a $23 per day amenity fee and if there is going to be a valet parking fee it really should be included in the amenity fee. Street parking in the area is nearly impossible to find, so you are forced to have the car valeted even if you are just briefly returning to the hotel and want to quickly get ready to go out for dinner then leave again. We tipped the valets every single time they brought the car. Some days that was three or four times, and some times it was quite a long wait for the car even though we called ahead. The Concierge was very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. The front desk staff was helpful enough but definitely not over the top friendly. All in all I would say it was a very adequate place to stay. Just be aware of the parking situation and $27 per day valet fee. That, combined with the daily amenity fee, is an additional $50 per day.",MESA,"JULIE M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>MESA</strong>",2,3.0

Trolley cat stops at the door - so all very handy.We arrived and found the layout confusing. Reception is on the 3rd floor beside the pool. Very barren. All concrete - no plants or much shade. Guests checking in people watch the sunbathers to fill in time.Finally got our room. We found we had a twin when we had asked for a queen. We were told they would get back to us. After half an hour we rang again and was told they had rung but our phone was out of order. Rather strange since we were in one of their rooms and we had just used it to ring them?We were shown to another room which was a twin however, the Tv did not work nor did the internet. We were told it would take about an hour to get someone to fix it. After being checked into a room/rooms for two and a half hours we finally had a TV and internet. The rooms are very small and breakfast is an ""adventure""For breakfast you are given a cooler bag and you need to go down to the pool sometime after 6.30am and fill it up with cereals or pastries. Be warned it is configured so you only get one shot at it so you see people filling their cooler bag to overflowing. If you want a proper breakfast then you will need to go elsewhere. The other downside is that if you do not feel like lining up with your cooler bag you do not escape the noise from the pool side dinners from 6.30am onwards which rules out sleeping in.This hotel is good value if you want a cheap holiday and somewhere to stay near the beach. On both accounts it ticks the box for probably a good 3 star hotel. If you want a bit of peace and quiet in reasonable surrounding then consider another hotel.Also remember the bar and night club are on level three so if you get say the 5th floor you are just two above the noise of the pool and night club It has its place - just as a good family orientated hotel where atmosphere is not required and you want to be able to let your children run free around the pool -ni room in the hotel room itself.

Friendly staff. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. We had a partial ocean view which was fine. I rather be standing on the beach than looking at it. The breakfast did have quite a selection for just being continental. The location is good too. You are at the end of the main strip so it isn't as busy. I was worried about my youngest who is a picky eater but there were plenty of places to choose from. Tiki's was fun the grown-ups too. Even though I didn't use them, I did like how there were so many shuttles to take tourists all over. The pool is ok but when you are across the street from the ocean, why bother?The one con I did have was that being a beach hotel, I wish there was somewhere (bathroom/balcony) that we could hang our towels and swim suits. Instead it was getting all musty in the bathrooms. I saw a few towels go flying by our window if you hung it on the balcony.

We had room 1830 and had full view of Waikiki strip, partial Diamond Head when on the Lanai and a fantastic Birdseye view to watch the surfers because the beachfront was directly across the street with no view obstruction. Comfortable room, clean bath, unlimited free movie & Xbox games to check out in lobby. The free breakfast buffet was nice with variety of cereal, sweet rolls, miso soup, yogurt, cut fruit, juices, coffee, but if you want an omelet, waffles or French toast you have to pay $4-$7. The breakfast on the beach option was nice. They leave to cooler lunch bags in your room and you go to the buffet and take what you want in to-go containers and you can cross the street and eat on the beach, take a table by the pool, or bring it back to your room. They were generous size lunch bags so you could easily take extra rolls or container of fruit for an afternoon snack. Breakfast ends at 9am and not being early risers on vacation we would literally hit the buffet in the last 10 minutes and never felt anything was lacking in selection. The onsite restaurant Tiki Bar & Grill was fantastic. It doesn't do breakfast but has a great menu for lunch & Dinner, or just drinks (Definitely try the Five-O Lava Flow or Shark Bait drinks!) with live music at times and awesome beach view! The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the pool wasn't as big as I expected but you are right across from a beautiful sandy beach with a breakwater wall so it's like a natural huge clear blue pool. We were within a comfortable walking distance of so much for even someone with limited mobility. There is more than one ""Aston"" hotel so be sure it has this exact name or you may be looking at another. Also lots on construction on the strip and some hotels, and I was fortunate to have family living there tell me which hotels have lots of construction going.

We stayed on the 17th floor and they still woke us. Obviously not in the hotels control but still a total bummer. I also wish breakfast could have been restocked until it was removed.

We were able to easily walk to the beach, surrounding restaurants, the Honolulu zoo, and meeting areas for the different tours we took. Included in the stay are unlimited DVD and PS3 game rentals (somewhat misleading, because there are only four different games to rent) and a continental breakfast. Offered at breakfast were items you'd see anywhere, but also some interesting items like taro donuts (loved these, not what I was expecting at all, much like a regular donut minus the blue color) and Japanese style noodles. You can also purchase other items, such as a custom made omelet for eight dollars. We did this one day in addition to our regular food and split it. The omelet was large and more than enough for the two of us. The downside to this delicious, continental breakfast? The SEATING. Most seats are around the pool and directly in the sun, and if you go anytime past seven AM, you'll be fighting for a seat. After we'd recovered from jet lag and woke up later than we had been, we chose on our last day to go back to the room and eat. Overall, we found the rooms to be spacious and clean. However, our bathroom had numerous tiny bugs crawling around. The other two couples traveling with us reported none in their rooms. Also, I found the elevators to be a hassle. In order to take the elevator, you MUST have your key, which then is scanned for going up or down. One day, we were trying to go down to leave and kept receiving the message, ""See front desk."" To make the matter worse, staircases are NOT easily located, in fact this may be the only hotel where I haven't seen a map on the back of the door or near the elevator bank listing the locations in case of emergency.

Our coolers were missing but the check-in person gave us replacements. The partial ocean view was just that, partial.

The check in was flawless, the beds are very comfortable and anytime we have needed anything it has been supplied in a matter of minutes. We are here for three weeks and are very happy with our change of accomodation. Only suggestion I would add to the hotel would be as you are a family hotel if you could somehow incorporate a laundry you hotel would get 100% rating from me.

My expectations weren't over the top, I simply wanted a well located, clean, comfortable room.On the positive end of the spectrum, the hotel is in a great location in terms of beach access and convenience to the local shops and restaurants. Two steps out the front valet area and you on are the main drag in Waikiki. The room we had originally booked (king bed) was unavailable when we checked in, so we were upgraded to a room with a full ocean view on the 14th floor. And, MAN, what a view it was! The view was absolutely stunning and hands down, the highlight of the trip. We had a full 180 degree panoramic view from Diamond Head on the left, all the way down the beach to the right. Wow!The staff was very friendly and helpful, there's a free continental breakfast included in your room price, which was nice, and they had live music in the pool area morning and evening. Unfortunately, other than these points, the hotel was a huge let down.To start, the rooms are very, very worn and outdated. Even our, ""superior view"" room was thread bear. There's no pictures on the wall, etc. The beds are insufferably uncomfortable...mine had a divot in the middle as if the mattress were 10 years old. The sheets were scratchy to the point of being uncomfortable on my face, and there are only two thin sheets with a thin blanket in between to cover yourself....no comforter, no duvet, no blanket. The thermostat in our room was broken, so the only way to achieve much needed AC was to allow it to blast on non-stop at a mind numbing 65 degrees. Again, with no blanket to cover up, we froze all night. Opening the balcony door wasn't an option at night because you can hear EVERYTHING coming up from the street...all night long. Music, laughter, sirens, traffic. It's a busy, loud street late into the night, and the position of the hotel, while beautiful for ocean viewing, is horrible for peace and quiet.The bathroom was tiny, especially the sink area...there wasn't room for 2 people's toiletries. The towels were tiny, thin, and scratchy. The showerhead itself was positioned so low that even at my fairly normal height of 5'7, I had to bend down to get the top of my head wet.While we did have free wifi in our room, it didn't work out on the balcony (ummm, what)? So, it was limiting.Overall, I would pass on this hotel and spend a few more dollars and stay at one of the other newer, nicer resorts along this road.","San Diego, CA","RideMeToTheMoon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, CA</strong>",31,2.0

We arrived on a sunday night and the place was packed. The said we could upgrade on Wednesday free of charge to a ocean view.

Three out of five guests in the room woke up with itchy bed bug bites. We go downstairs to the front desk clerk, Geri, to tell her about the awful situation. She calls a third party contracted company and has the 3/5 of us fill out a claim informing us that the hotel's insurance company would be reaching out to us in a few days. In addition, they had us pack all of our belongings, and the hotel moves us into a different room. This process took over an hour, and it was the most inconvenient experience for a vacation. In this new room, the sink was broken. We had to turn it a specific way in order for it to turn off and not waste water. Great... We were already behind schedule for our day activities, but made it back in time to get ready for dinner. One of the guests in our room sat on the couch for about an hour while waiting for the bathroom to be free so that she could have her turn to shower. She gets off the couch, and finds 3 new bed bug bites. At this point, we are disgusted and do NOT want to stay here. We call the front desk, and the same process occurs. Third party contracted company comes up to our room, the guest that got bit fills out a claim, and they want to move us AGAIN. We do NOT want to pack all our things again. We want to check out of this disgusting hotel. Both the night shift supervisor, Steph and hotel manager, Adam, advised that they could not offer any refund, waive any hotel resort or parking fees, or do anything to accommodate us except move us to a different room. WHY ON EARTH WOULD WE WANT TO MOVE ROOMS AGAIN when the same situation occurred. The risk of moving rooms is the same as staying in the bug infested room. We even asked, ""what would you want the hotel to do for you if you were in our situation?"" And they both responded with ""we would want to be compensated."" Exactly. We wanted our refunds or ANYTHING to better the situation, but neither did NOTHING!! We clearly did not want to pack all of our belongings and move rooms AGAIN. Adam repeatedly said everything is dealt through the hotel's insurance, and it would be against hotel policy to waive the approximate $25 resort fees per night and $27 parking per night. This totaled to $209 in fees that we had to pay. We figured this situation would be an exception, but they made no effort to better the situation. We were furious. WE ARE NEVER STAYING HERE AGAIN, and this is a warning to all guests. This hotel needs to be thoroughly inspected, and the priority of the hotel needs to be shifted to care more for their customers because that was clearly lacking.",,Christina B,8,1.0

We stayed at the Aston Waikiki beach hotel. We had a great stay - check out my review back then. So this year was my 50th birthday and there was no where else I wanted to be than Hawaii. I did some research for a few other hotels thinking we might want to try something else. But I kept coming back to Astons website and remembering how great it was to stay there. So I booked it again. We arrived about 4:00 pm on a Saturday. The valets were right there and ready to help us unload the car and get me set up for parking. They explained the process that I remembered from before. Up to the third floor to check in and was greeted with a warm aloha and a welcome back. They got us checked in right away, explained the elevator system and sent us to our room. This time on the 12th floor looking right out over Waikiki beach. The room was clean, bed comfortable, bathroom well equipped and a view to die for. On the second night we had taken a free movie from the box downstairs to watch in the room. For some reason we were not able to get it working. We called for maintenance and they were there within 5 minutes. He fixed the machine (operator error on my part) and showed us how to work it properly. We enjoyed our movie and had a nice evening. Every time we needed the car we would call down and it was always there waiting for us. The valets were all friendly and helpful and always asked how our day was or what excursions we had done and always seemed genuinely interested. Just a great group of people down there. We had breakfast at the pool all but 2 mornings. One morning we took our bag of food and 2 chairs supplied by the hotel and sat on the beach eating breakfast. The other morning we are at a Lu lus for my birthday breakfast. (But that's another great review to come) the breakfast at Aston is good. They offer a good mix of regular and local items, donuts, bagels, pastries, sushi, soup, cereal etc. coffee, tea, juices, milk. All included in the room charge. You can also get a custom omelet or waffle for a small additional fee. For added enjoyment there is a singer and hula dancer that are great performers and welcome audience participation. It's just a really nice way to start every day. Sadly after 8 days it was time to go home. The checkout process was easy and painless. No surprise charges or anything in the bill. Very straightforward. However, since we had a 10pm flight I asked if there was any way we could have a late checkout. They asked how late and I answered 6:00 pm with a laugh knowing no hotel lets you stay that late. She looked in the screen and said that wouldn't be a problem and would only be $75.00. WOW! Seriously! I've asked other hotels in New England for a 1:00 pm checkout and am always told that I would have to pay for a full night.Well here is Aston stepping it up. We loved having the room until it was time to go the airport. It allowed us to see the pride parade, go to the pride festival, do some last minute shopping and have our last Hawaiian meal. Then take a nice shower before heading home. I guess since I've only stayed at the Aston Waikiki beach hotel the 2 times I went to Hawaii I don't have much to compare it to. But I will say just walking through some other hotel areas I can tell I made the right choice with Aston. Really hope I can come back in 2 years and stay at the best hotel on Waikiki beach.

The wifi was good but would have been great if it worked around the hotel and not just in the room, it didn't work on the balcony either.I didn't rate the breakfast - I mean pastries and cereal got a tad boring after day 3 so we decided to venture out the rest of the mornings. The pool area is small but welcoming and the tiki bar was great - cheap food and drinks.We didn't use the valet but it seemed to be very hectic and I heard a lot of people complaining. The trolley/bus stop out the front was really convenient to get about and the beach over the road was perfect. The activity/tour desk gave us very misleading information and after spending almost $2000aud we were a little disappointed with the outcomes of the tours/activities having not been told the correct information when booking.I would visit Hawaii again but id stay somewhere that offered a little more than what the Aston did but mahalo for making our trip one to remember.

We traveled with family of 14 people. I prepared myself after reading countless review about this hotel, some good some not so good.

We had a 15 passenger Van and when we first pulled up the valet looked frightened but they accommodated us and we had a good experience with the valet staff. Never waited more than 10 mins. Check in was fast and easy. We had four standard rooms on the 5th floor. I tried to get us moved up to higher floors but they were unable to accommodate our request, no biggie we were still had a slight partial view of the ocean. Besides we didn't spend a whole lot of time in the room anyway as we were out exploring the island. All of our rooms were clean and comfortable with the exception one that we had problems with. The bathroom had a strong odor of wet mildew, the hairdryer was not working, there was something disgusting on the balcony, and the room door paint was peeling off. Once brought to the staffs attention they quickly did a thorough cleaning of the room and replaced the hairdryer. Breakfast was nice, Kiosk for movies and games was great to have. Loved that we were able to check out towels and beach chairs. Elevator system worked good. Overall we enjoyed our stay and hope to visit again soon.

We were checked in by Emma, who cheerfully upgraded us (without being asked) from partial ocean view to full ocean view deluxe on the 10th floor. The room had two queen beds and an absolutely perfect view of Waikiki Beach. Yes, as many have said, this is an older hotel and it did show in places, but it was clean and provided us with everything we needed. (After all, we were in Hawaii and who would want to spend excess time in the hotel?!) We rented a car and the bell staff were very accommodating and friendly (sorry, I didn't get names!). Yes, it did cost $27/day, but to us it was worth it so we could travel the island at our leisure. The ""beach breakfasts"" were satisfactory. My daughter loved the pastries and fruit, I'm more of a bacon & eggs person. One down-side, there are very few tables by the pool, so we had to sit on chaise lounges to eat - a bit uncomfortable. We didn't see too many people carrying chairs to the beach - and we didn't opt for that either.We did not eat at the Tiki Bar/Restaurant as neither of us saw anything on the menu that really appealed, but it did seem full each evening. We could hear the partying in our room, which disturbed my daughter more than me, because I was asleep the moment I hit the pillow!The walls are a bit ""thin"" and we could hear movement in the next room, i.e. toilet flushing, doors opening/closing - but not bothersome to me.A special thank you to the front desk staff: Geri, Glenn (who checked us out and printed our boarding passes), and of course to sweet Emma.

Free Wi-Fi in rooms - Twice I had to get someone to check the connections as it kept disappearing. After that there was quite often ""limited access"" which meant sometimes it went and sometimes it didn't. The biggest problem was they would not re-stock the toilet paper. Twice I had to ask for some. I had to resort to the tissues and even supplied my own at one stage. And it wasn't just our room - we heard some other people down the corridor asking the hotel cleaners for some more as well. The hair dryer never went. But I never complained about that since I`d already complained about the Wi-Fi and toilet paper enough times. There was no laundry at the hotel and we never had a laundry bag or form to have our laundry sent out. This wasn't a major issue as it was a good excuse to buy more clothes. And the other issue was the air conditioning was cold. It wouldn't turn up, only down. I could turn it off but this just gave me the choice of hot and stuffy or bloody freezing. The breakfasts were a good idea, the staff were friendly, the beds were comfy and the beach was right over the road.

My last visit was in 2011, and they have done some upgrades since then. The pool deck is completely new & quite nice! I read some previous reviews about he old pool deck furniture, but they have added all new furniture. Pro's: LOCATION! Gorgeous views of the beach & all amenities close by. Views from our room were fabulous! We chose the partial ocean view deluxe room & it was perfect. We have always stayed in the oceanfront rooms, but we were on a tighter budget this go round. I was still quite happy with our view from the 7th floor! Staff was wonderful from the front desk down to the cleaning staff. I asked for an additional chair & it was brought right up. We had the ""do not disturb"" sign on our door as I was leaving one morning & the maid saw me & quickly asked if she could at least refresh my towels, soaps, coffee, etc. We had a late flight home, and even though they were sold out, the front desk clerk (wish I remembered his name) was able to work some magic & allow us to check out an hour later, which gave us a place for a quick shower after an a.m. beach visit. This was a huge help! As mentioned before, pool deck was very nice! We never had a problem finding a lounger during the late afternoon. They also have a small drink/snack area by the pool where you can purchase drinks, hot dogs, etc., & they have frozen mocha's that are delicious! Breakfast was great. As others said it is carb laced which isn't too great, but they do at least offer yogurt and milk to get a little protein. I would say it is a step above a continental breakfast in that there was a larger variety, i.e. cereals, oatmeal, fresh fruit, several juices, etc. What I did was go to ABC & buy a hardboiled egg in their deli to go with my breakfast each morning & all was well! You can also buy the ""extra"" omlet or waffles, but I found that to be overpriced for what you got. Cons: I've seen comments about the rooms being dated. I don't feel this is an issue, & in fact the rooms were remodeled just before my first stay in 2007. I've noticed since then they've done some refreshing, with new paint, headbords, & dinette sets. What I did have a problem with was the bathroom & I will absolutely support this complaint! My particular issue was the floor. It was absolutely disgusting. It wasn't a lack of cleaning, but more permenant filth from being just plain old & guessing the original tile. Note to management, please make your next ""project"" a bathroom refresh. I personally wouldn't have a problem if you left the dated fixtures (vanity/tub) as they were in perfect condition, but the floor & ceiling where they repainted over mold has got to be replaced. This is the main reason I wasn't quite ready to give this a 5 star rating. We went to use the safe & there was a sign advising of a charge to use it? It is absurd that this would not be included in the lovely ""resort fee"" that is mandatory to stay here. I was disappointed at this. As many have complained, the ""resort fee"". Management can defend it anyway they want to, but if you have a MANDATORY fee that is not optional then you need to include it in the listing price of the room. It is beyond annoying when you see a room price of say $150/night only to push forward to the final booking screen to see your rate is now $200+ with taxes and resort fees. Put the higher price up front so there is no misinterpretation, bait & switch, etc. I saw management reply to an earlier comment with something to the effect of ""resort fees are common in Waikiki"", I ask does this excuse work with your kids? i.e. ""everyone else is doing it...."". Two wrongs don't make a right. I appreciate management taking the time to reply to reviewers, however you have a loyal customer in me, so please do not ruin that with a condescending reply attempting to justify the ""resort fee"". Nothing you can say is gong to change my view & condescending comments will only push me away from your facility for future visits. Overall, for the price we paid the return of investment was great. Our price with all fees & taxes ended up just over $180/night, and unless you want to go a block or two off beach you really can't find anything better I will stay here again if I can get a similar deal.",Washington,"traveltosun</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington</strong>",43,4.0

True there isn't enough seating poolside to accommodate all guests for breakfast but why would you want to eat by a pool when the beach is across the street anyway?

I spent a long time searching the net on all the hotel booking sites only to find the best price was to book direct. We prepaid everything before going including our resort fee.We taxied from the Airport probably our first mistake $50USD including tip and took about 30 minutes. On returning to the airport we used the hotel shuttle $12USD plus tip per person and took only 45 minutes as it was filled primarily with our hotels guests it only had one other stop so there was very little time difference to the airport when comparing to the cab. Obviously if there are more people then by all means for convenient to jump in a cab.We arrived at the hotel about 1pm and although we could check in, our room was not ready until 2.30pm and guaranteed by 3pm. Over the next few days it did seem from what I observed that the rooms weren't available for early check in very often.We booked a room with a partial ocean front view and a balcony with a chair ( some were only walkout balconies not for siting out on). We were on the 8th floor and had no problems with noise from either the music or traffic.We had beautiful views of Waikiki Beach and also overlooked the pool. On the down side was that we faced west making our room quite warm and by lunchtime way to hot to sit on the balcony, but the mornings and evening especially sunset were stunning.The rooms were average decor but certainly comfortable as was the king size bed,a FRIDGE, coffee maker and we requested a kettle for making tea. There was plenty of drawer and hanging space for our clothes.We had a DVD player in our room and on checkin you are given a card that allows you to go to a self serve machine and select DVDs to watch all of which were complimentary, great for night time or a bit of timeout.Our bathroom had a shower over the bath.It also had a bar and 2 stools to sit on inside the room which was a little bizarre as the curtains and door didn't pull back far enough to enjoy the view and as soon as you opened the door the air con stopped anyway, but it was still nice to have somewhere for both of us to sit and enjoy a drink. We had to call room service for a corkscrew and couldn't get a wine glass which I thought was wrong they should have been in our room to start with.There was a ice machine on our floor.The resort fee included breakfast and on checkin we were told that we had little cooler bags in our rooms that were for our use at breakfast and that we were welcome to fill these up from the buffet and use them throughout the day or even go across and sit on the beach for breakfast. A bit confusing until the first breakfast experience and we walked around the buffet filling up our little cooler bag, with cut up fruit, muffins, pastries, yoghurts, bagels, spreads. Tea and coffee was also available as much as you wanted but the buffet was not able to returned too, so get everything you want in one go. Also available for purchase were Belgian Waffles, omelettes, juice and toast. A lovely touch was the live Hawaiian music and dancers a beautiful way to wake up and start your day in Hawaii.The hotel has a great little bar restaurant on site called Tiki's that has a great atmosphere, good food at reasonable prices and stunning views especially at a Sunset and there is live music everyday.The pool area was nothing special and there was no spa but the biggest downer for me was that there was not a self serve laundry on site. The fitness area was adequate. Another plus for this hotel was the Elevator system a little strange to work out at first but it works really well and we had very little wait on lifts.I would give this hotel a solid 8/10 it wasn't luxury in fact nowhere near it but it's personal touches, breakfast, atmosphere, and location more then made up for it.We really enjoyed staying here and would definitely book in again on our next visit.",brisbane,"joyce l</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>brisbane</strong>",46,4.0

My husband was really interested in the breakfast on the beach every morning. Of course we would have booked an ocean view or an oceanfront room, but as it turned out I found a great deal on a condo and talked him into having breakfast there every morning. We ended up at Aston Waikiki beach for one night and really only for a few hours because United had some flight issues and they were gracious enough to put us up for the night. So it could be that because we had a voucher from an airline we ended up with the nastiest room in the resort, or it could be that any room that isn't ocean view or oceanfront is just a dive. And that's pretty much how I would describe our room. It was run down. The tile in the bath was in need of repair. The bath wasn't even clean, there were a couple of hairs that had been missed by housekeeping. The room was dark. No brightly colored tropical prints on the bed or the walls. The elevators have no buttons. You scan your room key in the outside of the elevator and put in the floor before you get on the elevator. Just a little bizarre. I was grateful we hadn't booked and stayed here. And the coffee maker was a kuerig which was fantastic but the room had no to go cups and no decaf pods and sadly for me I have to have decaf. It was room 2012 which had a view of other hotels. It was also a double queen and the darling at the front desk, she really was a dear, said it was a mini-suite. There was nothing suite-ish about it.

Expect to wait 15 minutes just to drop your vehicle off and longer for pickup. We paid extra for the ""Beach View"" room which was 10 floors below our friends and a smaller room. Definitely not worth the expense, save your money for parking. Rooms allow in a significant amount of street noise. Facilities are dated and cramped.

We had the perfect view of the Zoo, Diamond Head and when we looked to the right, the beautiful beach/ocean and breakwater/pier. The only downfall to the room was its proximity to the elevator cars which were quite noisy and took a couple days to get used to. The elevators themselves were easy to use - I read many reviews stating that they were confusing and difficult to use but we found them easy to work with. The complimentary buffet breakfast each morning was also quite nice. Yes, the offerings were the same every day but it was free, why complain about something free??! We picked up extra fruit and yogurts, muffins and pastries which helped tide the kids over on car rides around the island in addition to eating breakfast three days out of our week.

Location, location, location...it's perfect! The ocean is right in front of you as well as the amazing view of the diamond head. The rooms are not as bad they describe it to be. Yes, they can use some remodeling and updating. But hey, when we were in Hawaii, we were hardly in the bathrooms! It serves its purpose. The only two things I would recommend management to take a second look into are the ridiculous parking charges. I know it's Waikiki but it's totally impractical. Second, breakfast food. It's very generous of them, really. And I totally thank them that I dont have to worry about where I'm going to get food early in the morning. My suggestion is, to add a little bit more variety. On the 4th morning, I had to go to the nearest mcdonalds. But overall, it was nice. They also have little baskets in each room for you to take whatever you want from the breakfast buffet and take it to the beach or wherever you want to. That was awesome.A few days before our arrival, I sent an email to their office for some requests. Not only did I get a prompt response, we also got what we requested for and more! Our rooms were pre-assigned before check in and on both rooms we found cards with our names on it and a box of chocolates! A very sweet touch!

I had never stayed at this end of Waikiki Beach, but with its position opposite the Kuhio Beach breakwall, its a MUST!!The Hotel itself is typical Waikiki.

Obviously the evergrowing problem of the homeless in Honolulu is an issue, but I found them to be quite relaxed in the area around the Hotel.

We booked the special newlywed package at a reduced rate. We received a souvenir frame and a bottle of sparkling wine as a congratulations. All the staff members we interacted with — from the front desk to housekeeping — were very friendly and accommodating. The resort fee pays for your breakfast, free DVD rentals (which we did not take advantage of), and towels at the pool (which is pretty small, but with the beach right across the street, who cares?).We got a partial ocean view room with a full-size lanai. It provided a great view of the ocean and sunset, so a full ocean view would have probably been overkill. They were able to accommodate our request for a high-floor room, which I had hoped would be less noisy. Having been up since 3 a.m. EST, we just wanted a little peace and quiet for our first night. We could still hear the festivities from the pool and bar from our 20th-floor room, however. I would recommend asking for a room on the Diamond Head side of the hotel if you want quiet (though I don't know how good the ocean view was from that side).The room was clean but definitely needs updated. The bathroom was tiny and didn't have a fan, so it got really hot during showers. We had trouble working the air conditioner (once we got it on, we couldn't get it to turn off) and the TV only had sound and no picture. But, you don't come to Hawaii to watch TV, so that didn't really bother us. The bed and pillows were pretty comfy, but there was no extra blanket provided. We appreciated the complimentary breakfast, though we wish there were more protein options instead of just fruit and pastries. Get there early, as there was a line before they opened at 6:30.... and beware – there are some greedy people who will take as many items as they can, even though there are signs (and common sense) that politely request not to do that.We mentioned these things (both good and bad) in the survey we got via email after we checked out and almost immediately received a response from the guest services coordinator. She apologized that our stay was not up to our expectations and offered a partial refund as a gesture of goodwill. Unnecessary — we really did have a nice time, and only wanted to let them know if the issues in our room so they could get them fixed — but appreciated all the same.

I reserved 2 rooms ahead of time, about 3 months before our trip. My family and I arrived at the hotel to check into our rooms. We have requested ahead of time to either have our rooms next to each other or on the same floor. Front desk told us that our rooms were not ready. No problem, we understand we were 1 hour early to our check in time anyways so we left our luggage's with the Bell desk and went to explore. We ate and explored the nearby area for about 2 1/2 hours and then returned to the hotel to proceed to check in. The front desk girl told us that 1 of our rooms was ready, but the other one was having maintenance issues and so they would need to relocate us to another floor. We stood at the front desk for a good 20 mins while the front desk girl was still trying to check us in. After seeing that I was getting impatient and the people behind us were getting checked in to their rooms fairly quickly, she proceeded to instruct my family and I to go up to the 1 room and wait for her. She mentioned something about her computer having glitches and that she would personally come up and hand us our new room location and keys once she gets that fixed. So we did as told and went up to the room to wait. My family and I waited in the room for a good 15-20 mins, no word. Finally, we got restless and called the front desk from the room to see what was going on. The front desk continues to tell us that they cannot get us our rooms, and quickly passed us along to their supervisor. The supervisor (Stephen) was also not helpful and proceeded to tell me that our rooms would not be ready for another hour! I was getting pretty irritated and angry, the fact that (1) they sent us all up here to wait with the promise that we would get our room, (2) then they don't even bother to give us a courtesy call to let us know what was happening (whether we would get rooms or not), and last, (3) the supervisor tells us that we have to wait again. The bell guy also showed up at the room with our luggage's and I had to send him back down and explain to him that we were not staying in that room. So my family and I had to go back to the front desk. By that time, I was very furious as it has been 4 hours now since we arrived and still we don't have rooms. We did not agree with them making us wait another hour, they gave us sorry excuses about glitches with their computer system and that they couldn't switch rooms around in their system. But we refused to wait another hour for our rooms and stood firm until they gave us the rooms we were promised. Miraculously, after not giving in for about 15 mins, they were able to shuffle things around and got us our 2 rooms. To compensate for the hassle we had to go through with them, they promised that our valet parking would be compensated for the ""WHOLE STAY"" (note the bold). When they initially told us, they tried to be as vague as possible, but I recall specifically asking if the valet will be compensated for the whole stay, and the supervisor said YES. But when we checked out and got our bill, well,...disappointed again! We were charged for the valet for the whole stay. When we brought it up to them, they said No, they were only going to compensate us the valet parking for 1 day. Furious again, we had to backtrack and remind them what they promised us. Then they have the nerve to tell us that they can't waive the valet since it's on another system. Then how were they able to comp the 1 day valet that they were going to give us? We did not give in to their excuses and stood firm on getting what we were promised. Finally, after 15-20 mins, another miracle happened, they were able to credit us for the whole valet stay as promised. Again, they blamed it all on their computer/system glitch that the bill was incorrect. So overall, this hotel needs to really work on providing good customer service and to deliver on what is promised. It seems like the people employed by this hotel have been working on perfecting excuses and misleading their guests. A few other things to note about this hotel:1. Valet parking - HORRIBLE valet parking service. We would call 10-15 min ahead before going out to ensure our car is ready, and we always end up waiting. One time, we ended up waiting for 30 mins. I would NOT pay the $27 daily valet parking. 2. Complimentary Breakfast - Ok, just a bunch of pastries. They have a breakfast station that will serve waffles, pancakes, sausages, eggs, etc...for $8. 3. Rooms - pretty old and outdated. 4. Elevators - SMALL, you can barely fit 8 people in there. And when people are coming in and out with luggage's....good luck trying to squeeze in there. The only good thing about this hotel is the location, the beach is right across the street and there are some shops and restaurants nearby. We will never come back to this hotel! My family and I are not picky, all we wanted was our rooms. But they continue to mislead us and in the end, they lost future guests. Word of advise if you plan to stay at this hotel - ask specific questions and do not give in to their excuses. They make it appear like they can't do certain things and will give you their #1 response - computer/system glitch.","Sacramento, California","zjyang</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, California</strong>",10,1.0

The hotel is across the street from the enclosed swimming beach which is nice since there is no coral in the protected area. However you're not really in the ocean with some surf. Breakfast is included from 630 AM to 9 AM which is too early for us night owls. Be sure and take the small ""cooler"" type bag in your room to breakfast so you can load up on food for the day. They don't supply trays so this is the only way to carry your food to the chairs around the pool. There are never enough tables for breakfast so either share, eat in your room, or use the lounge chairs with small low side tables to eat breakfast. You can take as much food as you like which is mainly pastry, fruit, yogurt, etc and they have a good selection of drinks. It often rains in the morning so either eat in your room or take a towel to dry off the chairs and tables. The reception area is on the ""third"" floor which as far as I can tell is actually the second floor. The elevator system is bizarre, unique, and good for security. You ""scan"" your room card in front of the elevator control buttons, punch in your floor on the keypad, and then the elevator number (the letters A through E) you are to board will flash on the screen. There are no floor buttons in the elevator so you must board the elevator designated. The elevators worked very well. The room was smallish for a $180 a night room but it was clean with a nice balcony with oblique ocean view. The hotel is perpendicular to the beach so rooms on all sides seem to have a decent though ""oblique"" view. I wouldn't advise paying extra for an ""ocean"" view. Supposedly they did upgrade us for free at check in. There is plenty of counter space in the bathroom with single sink. There was a free in-room safe as well as a frig that was empty and not a mini-bar - a nice touch IMHO. No bugs in the room even though Hawaii is famous for them. (I've even had roaches in some rental cars there!) The AC worked fine. The balconies are set up so your neighbor can peak into your room if they choose. Only one chair on the balcony although there was room for two. It's $27 a day to park your car, plus tip. Resort fee is $23 so the room price was actually over $200 per day. Forgot to mention that they do have live entertainment at breakfast. Nothing much but a nice touch. The hotel is the last hotel on Kalakaua before the park and zoo on the Diamond Head end of Waikiki. But it's a convenient location. The pool is OK but nothing special. If you feel lucky you could park your car along the Ala Wai Canal and walk to the hotel and save $27 a day for valet parking which is the only way you can park your car. No problem with the valet parking. It was timely and courteous. The included Wi-Fi worked well in the room.","Las Vegas, Nevada","Homeboynot</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",120,3.0

It's got shops of all manners and kinds within walking distance of the hotel and it offers all of the amenities you could need to be happy. It can get a little loud at night with bands playing at bars close by, but it's not that bad at all. It takes some getting used to the elevator system as you must use a key to access the elevator and it only let's you pick one floor as your destination. So if you need to meet friends you have to meet them in the lobby they can't just come up to see you at your room. From a security standpoint it's great! But it can also be a little more work as well. I really enjoyed my stay here and I feel it's a good value for the location. I would stay here again without question.

My wife and I are seasoned travelers and this property met all of our expectations so we could focus on enjoying our holiday. Our room was clean, well laid out, and very comfortable. The view from our lanai was outstanding. The in-room safe is great for travel documents and other important items. The bathrooms are very clean, well-stocked and well maintained. The king bed was exceedingly comfortable which is a real bonus after a busy day of sightseeing. The hotel is in an excellent location; walk across the street you are on the beach, walk west on Kalakua Avenue you have all the activity, restaurants, & shopping, or walk east you have the quiet of the Kapiolani Park with the Zoo, Aquarium and band shell.The hotel staff members are excellent. Every staff member we encountered during our stay performed their duties with skill and a very friendly manner. Front desk, hospitality, pool, housekeeping, engineering and security personnel made our stay comfortable and pleasant. Observing the challenges the staff encounter every day and the positive manner with which they handle them is truly amazing.We felt that we received excellent value for our dollar. The resort fee covers a lot of value features. We really like the breakfast, filling our bags and enjoying it on our lanai. The music and hula dancer at the breakfast is truly first rate and truly Hawaiian. We didn’t use some of the things covered by the resort fee, but that’s the real world, other people do use them.I have to say the elevator system is the most efficient we have experienced. Swipe your room card at a kiosk and enter your floor number and one of 5 elevators will be assigned to you. Then, it’s get on and go. To go to the registration/pool level press the star key on your floor. There are no rushes for the elevators at high traffic times and you don’t get on an elevator with all the floors selected by a previous prankster.Renovations were being made to the pool deck and the registration area. The results are very light and fresh. We did not experience any inconvenience as a result of the renovations being done.

The complimentary breakfast they offer consists of lots of pastries and muffins, fruits, cereal, and the usual coffee, tea, juice. There was an omelette and waffle station but you had to pay for those and considering that the hotel charges a daily fee for such things as the breakfast, that should be included in the breakfast instead of paying for it.

We chose this hotel due to the location and for the view and we were not disappointed. Our room on the 18th floor provided us with one of the best views we have ever had anywhere. Check in was fast, friendly and we received instructions about using our card for the elevator which was a little awkward at first, but makes sense after using the card prior to getting in the elevator. It provides a great level of safety and makes the elevators run more efficiently. The check in on the 3rd floor rather than on ground level makes it somewhat burdensome if juggling several pieces of luggage which was a negative. We had a problem with the air conditioner after checking in as it simply was not cooling the room, but one call to have maintenance check in out was enough to get quick efficient service. It was a very easy fix and the repairman was very friendly and glad to help. Our room was not terribly outdated; however the bath area could use some upgrading. We didn't participate in the breakfast provided using the cooler; rather we opted for breakfast elsewhere so we can't comment on this feature which seems to have both positive and negative comments.

We took our food back to the room and ate on our balcony most days. Maid service was good. Rooms clean. A little more attention to cleaning bath as ring around tub noticed on our first day there. Beds very comfortable. Clean towels every day. Beach towels/chairs available to sign out which was great. Like availability of tour desk. Used it to book 4 tours. All great! Hotel rooms are older and have been updated but served our purpose. Ice and pop machines on our floor and used them often. Anything in room should be gratis. Don't put water in the room if it isn't free. Overall our stay was very enjoyable. Hawaii is a wonderful place to visit. People are friendly and would definitely stay here again.","Cambridge, Canada","PACMEG6</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, Canada</strong>",9,4.0

So, when we needed a couple days away from our family group after our wedding, we booked the newlywed special for a weekend. Some of it was still great, other parts, not so much. Since I had to go to the wedding venue before the check in time, I went to the hotel for the bell service to hold my luggage and do the check in paperwork so we could check in upon our arrival late in the evening after the wedding. Luckily, a room was ready and they gave it to us, which was great customer service. First, the view from the Oceanfront Select is truly gorgeous, can't complain about that at all. The balconies however are very close to each other, so no real privacy when sitting out there (also to note: there is only space for one chair and footstool on the balcony, not a big deal). Also, the door was a bit difficult to open for some reason. Unfortunately, the hallway and room decor is beginning to look a little dated and worn. Also, there was a stain of some type on the pillow case that we saw right when we arrived. Opening the bed, the sheets looked a bit dingy. Not appealing for a honeymoon stay. However, the hotel did provide a lovely bottle of champagne when we arrived at the room in the evening. The ceiling panel in the bathroom that I think must provide access to the A/C kept coming down at one corner. The provided bath amenities were fine. The water pressure in the shower was good. The best things about this hotel, the location, the breakfast (along with the little cooler to take it to go), and the customer service. The rooms being a little worn and in need of a little more attention being the cons. It's just me perhaps, but for the price, I'd expect just a little more from the condition of the rooms.","Columbia, South Carolina","foozlegirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbia, South Carolina</strong>",6,3.0

We had a room with a partial ocean view, but when we stepped out on the (very tiny) balcony, we had a glorious view of Waikiki Beach. It is burned into my memory forever. The only thing I would do differently, and that would depend on the cost, would be to get a room with a bigger balcony. But while you are in Hawaii, who wants to be stuck in a hotel anyway? If you are a smoker, you cannot smoke anywhere but on the sidewalk. If you smoke in the room, or the balcony, it could cost you an extra $450. But that's for all hotels.

I was on the 12th floor so it wasn't bad with noise and great view. Now the wifi internet....sucked.

We very much enjoy this hotel for the staff and the location. When we arrived on a Wednesday evening we were able to get an upgrade to our ocean front room to a higher floor corner room if we didn't mind doing it on Friday. That was fine with us and took our assigned room for two nights. When we arrived in our room the bathroom had not been cleaned, in fact it was filthy. I called the desk and spoke with Chris who had checked us in, housekeeping arrived in less then 5 minutes and cleaned our bath. On Friday we moved to our new room that was fabulous. They staff, especially housekeeping, was professional and friendly.I have read reviews here that the rooms were noisy from Tiki's and the street. Our first room was on the 12th floor on front and the next was the 16th and had no problem with noise at all.  The downside to our stay was that it was during spring break and the number of adolescence/ teenagers in school groups staying at this hotel was overwhelming. They clogged the elevators, breakfast and lobby. I don't mind children when accompanied by parents. However these children seemed to travel in packs and with no adult supervision that I observed. I don't know that this is fault of the hotel, however it did change the feel from our previous two visits.

I don’t normally do reviews but felt like I had to so that no one has to go through what me and my wife went through. If you are ever planning on a wedding at the Aston Waikiki Beach don’t do it!!!! Especially in the Coconut room on the 21st floor. My wife and I had a really bad experience from planning to the wedding day.1. I will not say any names but whoever is in charge of coordinating the venue has very poor communication skills and does not get back to you in a timely matter. If she feels that something needs attention in a timely matter she will email you back and expect a response ASAP but still ignores your question from the previous email. But if you decide to ditch the email route and call her directly she does not pick up her phone and won’t get back to you for a couple days. We figured that maybe she was busy for the first week or so but not over Six Month duration of dealing with her. This is what we dealt with the entire time.2. Since we are not from the islands and this was a destination wedding it was very difficult for us to know any better on the venue location. The thing that sold me and my wife on the venue was the view. There was an awesome view of the beach and the ocean. Because the venue was on a lanai we were exposed to the elements which were okay because we were in Hawaii. We figured hey lets have some fun in the sun and maybe if it rains we can put up umbrellas. We asked the venue coordinator and of course it took another week to find this out that no umbrellas would be provided so we accepted that if it rained it rained. However on the wedding it did not rain and the sun was out. We had 8 tables setup outside and all the guests on those tables were burning hot. Most of them were not prepared for this and left the ceremony early due to the extreme heat and sunburn. When we asked about umbrellas the coordinator said that we could not do anything about it. It was explained that during the time of our reception the sun will be beaming on the lanai, so if you plan to have a daytime wedding don’t do it. Again if would have known this before and in a timely manner it would’ve helped us decide whether or not go with the venue.3. A couple weeks before the wedding while we are trying to finalize items in the contract we go over the DJ information and she says that we never discussed having a DJ and that they could not have any DJ music. Who has a wedding without a DJ? There was no line in the contract stating that we could not have a DJ. Because I had already booked/paid my DJ he was cool enough to call her and straighten things out. Again if these were things we would’ve known ahead of time we wouldn’t have had the venue at this location. 4. Once we arrived on the island and met with the coordinator she kind of just handed us over to another coordinator. Which was fine but it was like the new coordinator knew nothing at all and this was her first time hearing about everything. So spend about half an hour going over details and what needs to happen. Come to the day of the event. Nothing was setup on time. They were an hour late and fortunately some of our family that was there early setup the tables and settings. Nothing was setup at all but 3 tables out of 10. When we asked the new coordinator about this she said the thought the event started at 1:00PM even though the contracts states that we had the venue from 12:30-5:00PM and we went over the start time 2 days before meeting her. Poor planning and attention to detail.5. If you are going to staff people to serve/bus at a wedding party make sure they want to be there and don’t make my guests feel uncomfortable. We heard from a couple of our guests that some of the servers were complaining about even being there and couldn’t wait to leave. 6. If I can say a couple things positive it would only be the great attitude of the Bartenders and the great tasting food. The overall experience we had with this wedding venue was horrible!!!!! If I could give this place negative starts I would.

The breakfast that's provided with the room costs is horrible. We only had this once. It consists of cereal and yogurt. We are from new Zealand and are quite spoilt with yogurt so thought this here was disgusting. There is a selection on pastries which were all stale. The pool is very small for the size of the hotel. But I must say all the pool area etc. Is very clean. The tikis bar located by the pool is great. But this is separate to the hotel. No room charge or anything.The staff are all quite rude. We were so shocked. When we Checked in which was very early but worth a try the front desk girl was very inconsiderate and kept talking over us. No idea about customer service. We also asked for some advise on transport down to other end of waikiki and was given a very cold response without any eye contact.That's ok though.....know one gets tips when they provide such poor service.

Located few steps away from the beach, just opposite fully enclosed part of lagoon, perfect for kids. We had an Aloha suite with separate sitting area - adequate space for two, but might be tight fit for four people, if sleeper sofa was unfolded. Modest bathroom and small closet, lots of furniture without storage space, only four very shallow drawers in the TV console. Connecting doors and front door very thin, so you can hear every word and every sneeze in the corridor and adjoining rooms on both sides. Gorgeous views of ocean, Kalakaua avenue and/or Diamond Head crater. Lots of street noise since hotel is located on the main thoroughfare where every tour bus and trolley, and Harley Davidsons too, makes left turn and stops to unload passengers. Two tiny lanais, more like step-out balconies facing similar wall of balconies in Marriott. Continental breakfasts served by the pool were very welcome addition to morning routine. Breakfast was very generous: cold and hot cereals, variety of Meadow Gold yogurts with exotic fruit, trays of fresh cut fruit, such as pineapple, watermelon, melon, mango, and sprinkle of grapes and kiwi slices, hot broth every other day, variety of asian salads and sushi rice, fruit drinks, teas and coffee, and huge selection of tasty pastries, pigs in the blanket included for meat lovers. Our hotel lunch boxes packed, served us both for breakfast and lunch. Plenty of eateries around, and a shrimp bus three blocks down Kuhio, within 10 minutes walk. Hotel staff is reasonably friendly, looks like they are in the process of struggling for better labor arrangements, which adds to the street noises in the mornings. Elevators have no buttons inside, you push your floor numbers outside, and wait for assigned elevator: A, B, C, D or E. Never took us too long to wait for it. Very decent place to stay, close to everything, we watched parade from the balcony, fireworks in the Hilton Village, morning surfboarders and sailboats, etc. Just surved our purpose for being in Waikiki.","Riverton, Utah","K1n0dar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Riverton, Utah</strong>",38,4.0

Free in-room wifi and a nice full continental breakfast. I'd love to tell you about the pool but who goes to Hawaii and sits by a pool? However, it did look nice as we walked by it on our way to the ocean :0) The hotel is within walking distance of anything you'd need and literally, right across the street from Waikiki Beach. We rented a car both times we went because we love to explore but it's really not necessary with this hotel's location. They've recently started charging an amenity fee (valet parking) but this appears to be the norm. Room was clean with a stunning ocean front view. The staff is very attentive, incredibly professional and friendly. And, check out is 12pm! If you're looking for quiet time though, Waikiki strip is not the place to find it. It's busy and noisy constantly but this is not anything the hotel has any control over. I talked to a local who said Oahu is known as the 'gathering place' where 90% of the state's population lives.

Turns out, the hotel was quite good. It's not frilly or fancy, and the rooms are small and old, but everything works. When I asked if we could be in a non-adjoining room, they made the switch right away, and in fact upgraded us to an ocean-view room. The staff were friendly and accommodating, and definitely helped make the stay comfortable. The location was wonderful; right across from an incredible beach with breakers so you could swim for as long as you wanted, and the hotel is at one end of a crazy strip of hotels and shops that goes on and on.. It's fun to walk the strip, but it was nice to be in an area that wasn't quite as busy, it was more laid back and restful. We booked our excursions through Pleasant Activities at the hotel, and they were pleasant to deal with. When one of our trips got cancelled due to weather, we had no issues getting our money refunded. The only things I would say were not good were the ""breakfast on the beach (the food was sparse and not very good), the pool (which was CLOSED during our stay!) and Tiki's Bar and Grill (we went one night and had to send our food back, it was so greasy).

So it is possible that my expectations were so low that I was pleasantly surprised. It is NOT a plush, luxury hotel. So if you tend to spend a lot of time lounging in your room on a vacation, then this probably isn't the right place for you. But if you just need a ""base-camp,"" then this is just fine.The room was nicely decorated with warm colors, and the furniture was nice. The bed was comfortable. The room was clean. It had a fridge, a safe, ironing board, and a coffee maker (single serve) with k-cups provided. The tv was also just fine. I had wireless coverage at all times with excellent connectivity. The breakfast is a buffet of fruit and pastries, cereal. Hot breakfast is available for a fee. If you do go, bring the small lunch bag with you and load it up. Even if you don't eat it all in the morning, put it in the fridge for a late night snack. Seating is limited around the pool. Yes, you can take it to the beach, but it's a bit of a hassle.The bathroom, on the other hand, did reflect the hotel's age. Upgrades have clearly been limited in the bathrooms. It did have broken tiles and a color that didn't match the rest of the bathroom. BUT it was clean, served our needs, provided a hot shower with good water pressure and a newer ""throne."" Fancy? No. Acceptable? Yes.There are no chairs in the room. So when we DID spend any time in the room, our option was a small high table with 2 benches, a lawn chair on the balcony, or the bed. Not a huge deal, but one level of discomfort.Valet parking only is dumb. But you will find that everywhere in the Waikiki area... Parking is very limited Ina condensed, busy tourist area. Go to the Aston Banyon, about 2 blocks from hotel entrance and pay for a week of parking at $80. Cash. That worked great. Ideal? No, but we would leave in the morning, walk our 2 blocks, and be gone to other areas of the silane all day. So,my ou learn to adjust. At least you're not waiting for someone to bring your car for you.The lobby is pleasant. Again,if you want luxury, go somewhere else and pay for it.Our only disappointment was even on 9th floor,new heard the constant traffic noise below us well into the night. It is a crowded, busy, tourist-heavy area, and the noise is a by-product of that. The beach is across the street. Nice beach area and great swimming in a protected area from the big surf. Be prepared, however, for the homeless who take over the picnic areas. This is a problem in the entire area, not just here.  The zoo is nearby. Many restaurants in the area. The location of this hotel is it's best feature. It is 2 blocks from the bus, and if you do drive, finding and getting to roads out of town are easy. They were customer service oriented, except for the bell staff/valet group who were friendly until they realized we didn't use valet parking.... My biggest complaint is the resort fee. Yes, I had good wireless internet. But the pool was under construction for our entire visit, and our fee should have been reduced fir that reason. And we were charged a fee to use the safe! So, be aware, as you compare hotel costs, be sure to include whatever their resort fees are in your comparison. We felt this was a total ripoff. So don't expect total luxury. But this is a satisfactory hotel for the cost, compared to other options. So don't stay away just because of a few cosmetic issues. Overall, except for the fee, we thought it was just fine as a home-base. And we were there 2 weeks.Here's a tip: if you bring your floaties to the ABC store, they will blow it up for you for 60-cents.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","479janetc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",25,3.0

Overall it is very difficult to pick a hotel in Honolulu from 5000 miles away. Do not rely on the pretty professional pictures they show on the Aston website alone.Do not rely on tripadvisor photos I looked at, most of 2009 vintage. Do use Google map street view to get a better idea of the hotel and its location.PLUS: Room clean and beds comfortable. Had an older fridge and nice flat screen tv.Beautiful view out tiny balcony of Diamondhead and if you lean way out a view of ocean.Fun place with Tiki bar a great place for a Mai Tai for $5 at happy hour and live music in evening.Excellent location right next to Kapiolani Park and the zoo. Right across from Kuhio beach and a short walk to action on Waikiki.You can catch the Pink line trolley for $2 right on side street to get to AlaMona shopping center.Other bus stops nearby -For 2.50 catch Bus2 to downtown or Bus 23 to Diamondhead for hikeWifi worked well and free movies a treat from machines in lobby.Continental breakfast okay but I am a donuts and coffee kinda guy.A/C worked well.MINUS: Room very tired and retro...suspect an Elvis groupie stayed here for the 1972 concert.Bathroom very dated but clean.The balcony was super small and only one person could stand on it.

Great for kids and lap swimming. Many restaurants to choose from. Tiki's, the Astons restaurant is very DELISH, original and fun. We enjoyed the live music and beach front views. Love the korean taco's, poke , fish tacos, and lilikoi Creme Burlee and fabulous tropical cocktails. Our rm was Oceanview on the 16th flr. The view has to be one the best sunset views in Waikiki. The lanai was small but fit 2 chairs and a small table. Our bed was comfortable and linens were soft & new. We had a bath tub, nice towels. My only complaint is the bathroom tile was old and should be replaced but was clean. The room decor was inviting and relaxing. The pool was open, pool water was chilly tho.

This disappoint went well beyond the renovations taking place, which included closing the pool deck. The “breakfast on the beach” is entirely misleading (it’s certainly not on the beach), disappointing, and poorly executed. We have never seen a hotel provide breakfast but then provide no plates, instead expecting their guests to place the items in a small paper bag and then into a provided cooler. Four tables are then provided for a full hotel that is 19 plus floors. Not surprisingly, we were never able to sit at the tables or enjoy the entertainment we saw one morning. The entertainment was for about a dozen people who were lucky enough to sit and eat. Instead we had little option but to return to our room and eat. The hotels suggestion to go across the street and eat at the beach is just not practical. You would need to carry the food, hot drinks, then sign out and carry chairs and eat out of your lap. Not surprisingly, we say nobody doing that. Most upsetting is that the hotel charges for this as part of the “resort” fee. Although it seems that there has been an attempt to update the rooms, that could not hide the chipped front door, stained bathtub and peeling paint. Our sheets were stained and the room was never fully cleaned, with the garbage not being emptied and waste just left behind. Upon review of our account at the end of our stay, we were taken aback to see a deposit fee of $2.00 per a room key card. While we returned the cards and received the $4.00 back, this is something we were never told about it at check-in. We have never seen a hotel require a deposit for plastic room card keys that are usually treated as disposable. After paying decent sum, plus tax each night, in addition to the ""resort"" fee, charging an additional $2.00 for a room key is a little insulting. The newspapers, also part of the “resort” fee, disappeared quickly. Why would they not be left out for the day? Or perhaps there just weren’t enough. In summary, we found this hotel to be a rather unwelcoming place to stay. The staff seemed largely disinterested, not even asking how our stay was upon leaving. No response was received to our feedback, sent after our stay. There are many other hotels to choose from in Waikiki and next time we would look to stay elsewhere.",Toronto,"Melkev2009</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto</strong>",15,2.0

We all made our reservations May 2014 because this was the best vacation package for the buck at that time. Prior to our arrival I discovered there were going to be some renovations taking place during our stay and the pool was going to be closed during that time. I communicated my disappointment and concerns directly by phone and emails with guest services and was advised they may be able to make some changes to our accommodations upon our arrival if the work was still going on. When we arrived, both couples were upgraded to better rooms with ocean views on upper floors and we were given permission to use a pool at another Aston property nearby if we desired to do so. These considerations were appreciated and we thank the Aston guest services for their assistance in this matter. Special thanks go to Stepha and Jon at the reception desk for all of their help. Your attention and service made it all work.Check-in went quickly in our case, but it was during a slow period as we saw other times that there were long lines of guests arriving and waiting for their chance to check-in. This I'm sure is due to various airline arrival time issues.The breakfast on the beach service went very well and the food was adequate for a simple breakfast, best described as a ""Continental style Breakfast"" nothing served hot as others have related.The rooms we were in were fine. Nothing extravagant, but clean and fully meeting our needs for the little time we spent in them. The beds were comfortable and the bedding was changed every 2 days. Not unusual and if requested, it would be changed sooner.The location was absolutely perfect for our needs. The beach was right across the street and all our transportation drop off and pickup stops were either right out front or within 50 yards away. This included local trolleys and bus stops.Numerous restaurants are nearby and even the best restaurants, shops and hotels are all within a 5-10 minute walk away. All in our party are in our 60's and found our walks in the area easy as well as safe. We did notice the sidewalks and all restaurants were somewhat crowded after 6PM. For shopping, a helpful hint is to go to the Flea market at the Aloha Bowl Stadium for all of your souvenir needs on Wednesdays and weekends for the absolute best deals anywhere. only $1.00 entry and 47 acres of sellers/stands selling everything at better prices than anywhere on the Waikiki beach strip.Would we select the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel again? Best answer is, if we were staying in Oahu, Absolutely Yes! It met our needs fine and we were treated very well.

We were in room 1419 and had a beautiful view of Waikiki Beach, including the fireworks on Friday night. The room was quiet even though it was directly over the pool except for the morning the housekeeping staff was marching in a demonstration with drums.The king-bed room was comfortable. (The Aston honored our request which was a major relief when we checked in. Thank you!) The housekeeping service was great, despite whatever their complaints are. They were friendly and accommodating, bringing extra hangers and even a feather pillow when I asked. The bed was comfortable and tv choices were adequate.On the other hand, the room is in bad need of renovation. Perhaps the renovation of the pool area is a sign of good things to come for the rest of the Aston, but I couldn't help but be put off by cracked tiles and the dingy tub in the bathroom which had an overall tired and worn out atmosphere.You can't get away from the resort fee so there's no use complaining about it. The Wi-Fi was adequate (it was a working vacation) and the breakfast was ok for a few days but we tired of it on Day 4 and started going out after that. Eating on the beach was fun once, but the rest of the time I took our yogurt and pastries back to the room where we ate on the lanai or at the hightop in the room. I would rather have two chairs on the lanai than a bench and chair, but we made do. We also took advantage of the beach towels.Should management decide on renovation, I do recommend taking some of the paint off the door. Whereas most hotel doors close automatically, our door was so heavy with old paint that we had to forcibly shut it and I was always afraid we'd be disturbing others with the loud bang.Tiki's downstairs was a great place to grab a Mai Tai in the afternoon and they give you a free Mai tai the next day every time you dine there so we took advantage of that. My husband said they had the best Poke of the whole trip and their drinks were all very good. There is also a Japanese Restaurant in the hotel around the corner which is excellent.

Therefore the arrival check in process was as expected.Instead of wasting time waiting around for 4-5+ hours we go to plan B which is, freshen up and change in the pool facility area and catch the 10am shuttle ($5 each way) outside the DFS shop to the Waikele outlets. This gets a shopping trip out of the way. On returning at 3.30pm our room is ready.The main room is a reasonable size and you do not feel cramped for space.It has a bench near the balcony and two wooden stools. The stools are not overly comfortable to use for any length of time, and you can only fit one on the small balcony. The balcony in our room (SE side) overlooks part of Kuhio Beach and the small jetty at the end of Kapahulu ave. This was perfect for me as this is the boogie board area and I was able to check out the waves from our room. As I have now found out, the surf at Waikiki at this time of year is not as good as other times of the year. The bathroom is clean and functional, but the fittings are starting to date and the last paint job to smarten up the room lacks a quality finish. The toilet has a loud flush and as a result you can hear the plumbing in the adjacent rooms especially in the early hours of the morning. Like many Waikiki hotels the Aston charges an additional daily Amenity fee on top of the room rate. Currently it is $23+tax. It supposedly covers (1) Breakfast (see below), (2) In-room WiFi, (3) In room coffee maker, (4) Unlimited movies and PS3 games, (5) Local calls, (6) Daily newspaper, (7) Fitness centre, (8) In room safe.The inclusion of a couple of these items in an additional fee is a bit dubious. Eg 2,3 & 8 are standard expectations in a 3-4 star hotel. We did find the available movies (4) to include some recently new releases and a reasonable selection was available. My wife said the Fitness centre was smallish and a bit claustrophobic so she didn’t use it much.There has been a fair bit written in reviews about breakfast. Breakfast consists of 4 types of Kellogs cereals, a large selection of pastries and cakes, yoghurt, sometimes there is some sort of packaged noodle, a fruit salad (same 4-5 fruits every day), orange fruit juice? (more like orange cordial), tea and coffee. Its Ok but as we were staying 15 nights we found you need to break it up by eating elsewhere a couple of times.Staying opposite the beach at Waikiki is not cheap, and its not hard to find nearby hotels significantly more expensive than the Aston. Whilst there were a couple of minor annoyances I would still consider returning based on location and price.Note: 90% of the total cost was billed to my credit card within days of making the booking. I then found the small print that said that they reserve the right to pre-authorize your card prior to arrival.","Blackburn, Australia","RobandCarmen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Blackburn, Australia</strong>",18,4.0

Prices for hotels close to the beach can be high so this was in the middle range and served our purpose. 3- 3.5 stars is about right.Pros:Location!! the beach is literally across the street. You can get free towels and chairs to take to the beach!Around the corner is Subway, Jamba Juice, Cookie Corner and some clothing/trinket stores. Go around that corner and there is an ABC store, a Tucker and Bev where you can get drinks and sandwiches. Then the Zoo is there too. very close. Wolfgang Puck Express is also downstairs if you want to grab salad or sandwich. Walk north and you'll hit the other hotels, plenty of restaurants and stores. 15 mins or so we hit the Royal Hawaiian Center - more stores and restaurants. the street behind the hotel I think is Kuhio st? is where we got the bus to Diamond Head - only 10 min bus ride at $2.50 so that was cool!The tours I scheduled also came to the hotel to pick us up so it's a good location.We got a room with partial view of the ocean room so the view was great on my right side, I got another hotel in front of me and the mountain behind that, it was ok. Also saw the storm on Valentine Day wknd, was awesome watching the winds and waves getting higher. thankfully wasn't stuck in the elevator like some other guests.The bedrm itself was fine. beds comfy and pillows good too. TV worked fine though my sister had a tv that was missing some channels in her room, weird. Her AC also wasn't working but ours were so bit inconsistent.DVD kiosks also great. got movies almost every night.Free bkfst (not really free since it's included in the ""resort fee"") which includes cereal, mini bagels and muffins, assorted pastries - some hawaiian pastries if you get there early enough. yogurt and fruit. Outside the room where they had the food, you can get coffee, tea, OJ and milk. You get a mini cooler bag so you can take your food outside to the poolside (when it was open) or to the beach or we took it back to our room.Hotel Staff were great and friendly. Maintenance came quickly to fix my sister's AC. When I dropped some foundation powder all over the floor, housekeeping was quick to come back to the room and vacuum my mess. =)Cons:The lanai is thin and can't put a chair and sit there to look at the ocean. Bathroom definitely needs a renovation. this ""resort fee"" bugged me but hard to avoid on Waikiki. Typically the fitness center is included in your room charge but it was part of the ""resort fee"". Granted the fee covered for the wi-fi, beach towels and chairs if you get them before they disappeared. Newspaper, bkfst and DVDs so it's going to show up on your bill - be prepared. Didn't have a car so I think they charge a separate fee for that. I read a lot of complaints about the new elevator. I have seen this system in another building so wasn't surprised but many people were bewildered. Just have to pass your card on the panels and punch in your room number then go to the elevator it tells you to. Security is the reason I hear for this system. It doesn't handle the rush of bkfst time though so was always waiting for it and once or twice it passed my floor. Probably because it was full but can't tell since I was just standing there and eventually figured out I have to hit that damn panel again. 8am-9am is the busy time and also when the good pastries are gone, go earlier! Also pool was out of order when we were there. was fixed couple of days before we left, oh well.... there is renovation going on so be aware. oh and no computer and/or printer to use so I can print vouchers for my tour! what??? the front desk offered but sorry didn't want to give them my password and user ID.Lastly, we arrived late and check in took forever! ok may have felt like forever but there were 2 people working and looked like they had guests with issues to deal with. Someone wanted to analyze their bill right there and the other couple were being moved to another room for some reason so it just made our check in process soooo long...Overall we had a great vacation.

We stayed 5 nights at the Aston Waikiki beach hotel. It is at the end of Waikiki beach and right next to the beach. There is a street separating the hotel from the beach but it is a very short walk across the street and you are on the beach. We had a great lower (9th floor) beach front room which I would recommend for a few dollars more. We just kept the balcony door open and listed to the waves and the live music they offer by the pool. It was a very relaxing stay and we could just sit on the bed and look out at the beautiful waters. Pros - beach close, good size rooms, clean rooms, loved the beach front balcony.Cons - there is a lot of construction so the hotel is a bit messy and there are unpainted walls, and wood panels, etc. The hotel does need some work and it not in the best shape (you can see it's age) but most of that is in the common areas (the rooms were good). The free breakfast was not too great. They give you a small lunch box and you take it down in the morning to an assembly line of good and you get some muffins, danish, fruit and yogurt. I have never seen anything like it and we did not eat there again after the first day. No one really could figure out how it works and it does need some explaining to know what they want you to do with the lunch box they leave in the room. But, it's free. The elevator situation is also not great. The are slow and they have a computerized elevator system (you push your floor number on a main panel in the hall and it tells you what elevator to go to.)Most guests had a hard time figuring out how to use them and were surprised to get in the elevator and see there were not buttons to push for the floor.

Here are the high points and low points -- High points - location, location, location. Being right across the street from the beach was great. Also, we could easily walk to San Souci Beach to the left or the beach in front of the Royal Hawaiian to the right. The included breakfast was also nice since I don't like to have to get up and get out and hunt for breakfast each morning. The DVD kiosk that is included was great. Each afternoon, my dg and I would pick out a movie to watch that night. There was lots to choose from. Another high point was that, even though I reserved the cheapest room, we had a view of the ocean (Room 824.) Several times, while sitting on the bed in the room, I could see whales spouting in the bay. Fabulous.- Low points - the elevators were not working very well the first day because of the high winds. I got very familiar with the inside of the service elevator. Once the winds cleared up the next day, the elevators worked fine. Our room had a super skinny lanai and no chairs for sitting on the lanai. I dragged a stool out there each morning and crammed myself in a corner to sit on while drinking my coffee. The fact that I had an oceanview room at a standard room price made up for it.I make a trip to Oahu each year with one of my grandkids (4 down, 3 to go) and would stay at the AWBH again for the location, the breakfast, and the DVDs (especially if I am able to get a good deal like I did this year.)","Red Bluff, California","lizinrb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Red Bluff, California</strong>",49,3.0

Diamond head and the park are right there next door, public transport within feet of hotel to airport, mall etc.. Breakfast on the beach will save you money each day and may stretch until noon ;) Plenty of food eaterys near by too. Sunset on the beach 100 yards from the hotel. Great service, our patio window had issues and I reported this at 6.45 am and the technician was up to promptly fix it by 7am. While some bemoan the resort fee it's pretty cheap (23 bucks per room per day I think) clean towels and deck chairs for beach each day, endless free dvd rental which is great for the kids. The staff were very friendly shoutout to Brezey, mahalo! Will definitely stay there again.","Boston, Massachusetts","IsaccoTenore</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",18,5.0

This trip however was really something else. I booked my room 6 months in advance, paying full rates for a delux room, week of travel though I found out they had work going on at the hotel which would cause a lot of noise and disruption and no use of the pool. Due to this, I requested a higher floor as I usually stay on the 20th, despite this I was placed on the 12th floor, directly above the pool that was being renovated and woke up to the sound of jack hammers every morning. On a couple of occassions I had to ask the front desk for bath towels as by 3 in the afternoon, house keeping still had not come round, and being in Hawaii, my friend and I had been doing beach activities and hiking, so a shower was really necessary by 3pm. For the most part, staff was very friendly. Some staff went above and beyond to be friendly and helpful to guests, and some also went a little too far by becoming flirtacious and hitting on guests. Based on this trip, I wouldnt recommend staying here for anything other than its location and Tikis Bar and Grill. Previous trips I would have recommended highly.

Just back from a fresh visit there this weekend. Let's just go with simple pros and cons on this one:CONS- Parking, valet service and entry/exit. Total system failure here. Wait times just for pulling into this valet only guest parking area are totally mismanaged and unacceptable. They've been doing this a while now, you'd think they'd have a system figured out, but they don't. Just waiting to pull in at peak times is a nightmare. You will have to drive around the block several times because of their one way entrance if you can't pull in. Attendants rarely, if ever come out and offer help or info about what's going on when it's backed up. If you need to leave, call down at least 30-45 minutes in advance, that's how long some of the wait times were just to get the car out. If you have dinner or show reservations, factor it in. Not to mention, the tourist trolleys and buses also stop directly on the curb at their driveway entrance. Again, peak morning and evening times are very bad with all the congestion.- The pool and deck are under rehab construction, so don't plan on swimming or laying out on the lanai there anytime soon. The 3rd floor reception area and elevators are also undergoing renovation, so it's not pretty.- And yes, that whole 3rd floor check in and elevator jam is just a mess. Elevators are automated to be more efficient, but with the volume of people moving through there at peak hours, be prepared to huddle with the masses until your elevator opens. This will continue even without the renovations going on because it's just a bad set up. Keep in mind this is also the same area where the complimentary breakfast is served, so it's like feeding time at the zoo especially between 8-9AM when everyone is grabbing to go to the beach. PROS- If you get a room with a beach view, good for you. But be prepared to have any of dozens of denizens from the Marriott across the street staring back at you. - Rooms are extremely average. But kudos to the housekeeping staff. The mostly Filipino staff are always friendly, accommodating and smiling. They should train the parking staff on customer service. - Location is great, if you like being in the middle (or actually the end) of everything Waikiki. You can jump on trolleys and buses without walking and the zoo and beach are right out the doors. You can stroll the whole length of Kalakaua in both directions. Just note that large portions of Waikiki are undergoing major commercial construction, including the classic International Marketplace which is completely gone and encircled by construction walls. The street has lost a lot of flavor and charm because of this I think. The Aston Waikiki is your average tourist churn hotel. They could do so much better by just improving their guest systems a bit.",California,"CaliforniaIslandBoy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",2,3.0

Honestly I had higher hopes of our hotel. When we first arrived my mom was ready to storm down to the front desk and raise noise. The bathroom floors were scary, the bathroom didn't have a proper fan, the beds were quite small, the pool wasn't available, our wifi didn't even work in our room (we used my moms room number instead), the parking that was suggested to me for $10 a night difference (at a sister hotel) was jacked up a few days before, and when we had asked about a room upgrade we felt a little laughed at. That being said, we calmed down. My mom's room was adjacent to diamond head with views through the alley to the beach. We however weren't quite as lucky with the room next door as we were directly across from someone else's lanai. Breakfast isn't really as bad as everyone makes it out to be. There was a good selection of pastries, yogurts, fruits, coffee, oatmeal, cereals and a few other things. You can take everything up to your room with the cooler bag they provide you with. They have hot water in the lobby at night which we used for cups of noodles from the store downstairs and for hot chocolate we have saved which was from breakfast. They also have lemon and orange water during the day which was always nice in passing. The biggest perk we found about our trip was being directly across from the beach and having Subway, Wolfgang Puck Express, Starbucks, ABC, and the small store in the downstairs lobby all at our fingertips. The biggest con about this hotel was quite possibly the elevators which decided to start to quit when there was a very windy day. It was a little nerve racking seeing a elevator door wide open and dark on the bottom floor and getting into elevator B only to have it go no where. There were a few times when they took us up from the lobby in the service elevator and then decided to open the stairway doors so we could freely get from our room floor to the lobby floor. I'm scared about elevators as it is so I took the stairs as much as possible after that. Another con which we luckily didn't have to deal with was how crazy busy the valet area gets. Right around 7ish it always seemed to get packed. A few times our car was either forgotten but another the valet was extra helpful to us. Most of the time they all seemed quite grumpy.","Langley City, Canada","Sydney M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Langley City, Canada</strong>",9,3.0

I had to request extra towels, shampoo and conditioner daily. I don't understand why they wouldn't stock the room appropriately?!? 3 large towels for 4 guests?

But when I got here the place is all renovations! When we pulled up the valet guy told us to take the elevator to the 3rd floor, when we got to the elevator there was a crowd of people trying to go to the 3rd floor to check in. The elevator you need a class just to use it, we had other guess teach us how to use it. The girl at the front desk was great (local girl from Kahalu'u) very friendly and helpful. Upon getting to the elevator we end up waiting again because of the complicated elevator system. The room was very small for a $280 a night room with a partial ocean view. Room was outdated, but clean! Beds are comfortable and clean. We had come for a stay cation and dinner in Waikiki. We went to Hy's steakhouse for dinner, it was great. It was a very peaceful night sleep. Upon getting up we found a bill was slid under the door for $93.75. The bill consisted of fees and taxes. $42.50 in taxes and $50 in fees and if you can believe it $2 for use of the room keys. We went down to the front desk to talk about this untold bill, and we're told that this is standard. I travel a lot and have never had to pay almost $100 like that. Usually the taxes are in the bill not a separate bill. Upon checking in we were told parking was free because the type of reservation we had. Then this morning we were told it wasn't.

When we got out of the cab we were absolutely swamped by about 3 men from the hotel. My partner was trying to sort out money from the cab driver which was proving to be difficult because the men were kept asking our name, booking dates and kept trying to grab our bags. We were really confused and didn't know what was going on. One of the men took our bags and told us to go upstairs to the front counter. He insisted that we were too early and wouldn't be able to check in (an hour early) and we would have to leave our bags with them downstairs and when our room was ready they would bring it up. We went upstairs and were advised that we could check in in 45 minutes. At this point I went back down and got my bag back off the man. He seemed resistant and stated that when we found out our room number we could just come back down, advise him and he would bring them up. I thought this was a little confusing because if I was going to come back down to tell him my room number, I might as well just get my bag.

The only reason it get's the second ""star"" is because of the location. It is literally right across the street from the ocean and we had AWESOME views from both the balcony (gorgeous ocean) and the back door (open air walkway that looked directly at Diamondhead.) That is it. We stayed 8 days, 7 nights, for our honeymoon. Upon arrival, we DID get an ""upgrade"" to an upper level, which gave us those awesome views. We had to pay an additional $28/night for a ""resort (laughable) fee"" and an additional $25/day for valet. The resort fee covered 2 coffees/day, unlimited redbox (their version) the pool (which was under construction and unusable) and breakfast (one walk through with a cooler - eggs, waffles, anything hot cost EXTRA!). The room we had was just run down and crappy. It was NOT a nice bed, the sheets were scratchy, and the mattress didn't have that nice luxury feel that you want when you stay in a hotel. The bathroom was dingy, had chipped tiles, and reminded me of a middle school for some reason. The shower head was too short for my husband and he had to scoot down to shower. At one point, there was a tile in the bathroom ceiling that fell down. This WAS NOT a quiet hotel. We heard literally every police car, construction vehicle, and trash pickup. The carpet was worn out, and the bathtub was grimy.Maid service was just bad. Twice, we were interrupted in our room by the maid who just came in and started cleaning. At one point, we had come back to the room and she had obviously been by and started cleaning earlier, and left our balcony door wide open. We were pretty high up, but the balconies touch and someone could easily climb in. I was on the phone with my father, who was scheduled to go in to major back surgery the next day, when the maid knocked on the door. We asked for 5 minutes while we wrapped up and got ready to leave. Instead, she told us she had things to do and just came in and started to clean anyways. I was trying to see how my dad was doing, and she's running the vacuum next to me. BEWARE: She DID NOT wash the glasses or coffee mugs, she only rinsed them and put them back. Gross. They didn't change the sheets while we were there - whatever, that's not a huge deal, but we're told it happens every three days. Not so. The construction was a complete distraction. I get that a hotel needs to update now and then - and this one especially - but we paid hundreds of dollars for this resort fee, and weren't able to use the pool or the downstairs area at all because it was so loud and dusty. I felt bad for the front desk people, it was SO LOUD. The elevators were brought down to only two for the whole hotel, and it took 10 minutes sometimes waiting for one to come up to us on the 23rd floor. We eventually said something after 5 or 6 days and they did give us half of our resort fee back, which counts for something but it felt like we still paid an extra $150 for nothing.The only people that we felt did a good job during our stay was the valet. They were prompt, friendly and took care of us. We never had to wait for our car, and we took it out more than once a day, every day.I would NOT recommend this hotel, 100 times over. We are usually pretty forgiving of hotels considering we didn't really even spend time in the room other than to sleep, and read a bit.

Although there were a lot of families staying at this hotel, I never heard any noises while trying to sleep, or otherwise throughout the day. In the minifridge the hotel offers some complimentary tastes of the island, try them!! I had some kind of mango soda the first day and it was so nice to come to my hotel to relax and be able to try some local flavors. Every morning the hotel offers breakfast by the pool complete with a ukelele player who sings and takes requests. The hotel provides a lunchbox in every room so you can take your breakfast to the beach to eat, or so you can stock up on some yogurt or fruit for later. Get to breakfast early or risk being left with few options. Don't plan on being able to find some chairs by the pool to eat either, sometimes just eating on your balcony is a better option because you can still hear the music but are not around all the people trying to eat. The hotel is located right by the zoo (highly recommend), and is within walking distance to all the shops and restaurants. It is a great home base for anywhere you may want to travel on the island, and is not too far from anywhere. I chose this hotel because I had heard great things about the location and I'm glad I did. The property is clean, quiet, and well-situated;the beach is literally right across the street. Unless you want to shell out tons of cash, you cannot do better than the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel.","Madrid, Spain","gabrielle d</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Madrid, Spain</strong>",17,5.0

No restaurant, room service or business center. They feature ""breakfast on the beach"", buffet tables of baked goods, some cereal, mixed fruit and beverages. Too many starches and the fruit was mostly melon, I did find a few pieces of papaya and pineapple but I was very early that morning.My biggest issue-I reserved a partial ocean view and had none. The front desk explained that because you can stand on the balcony and lean over and see the ocean this qualified. (not in my book) They did move me to a room with a view and an ice machine in hallway in front of the door. Luckily the machine was very quiet. The Wolfgang Puck Express in the lobby was a good place to eat.The front desk was very helpful and printed some documents for me without charge. The valet staff was funny and fast.

We were very disappointed to learn upon arriving that the pool is closed and under heavy construction (which is very very loud and continues all day). The lobby area is partially closed off and the escalator was closed on and off during our visit. Additionally, our telephone didn't work, the PS3 in the room didn't work (until we fixed it ourselves), and the bathroom was desperately needing an update. Breakfast left a lot to be desired (just some sweet buns and fruits) and we found the additional resort fee pretty high (it covers the amenities that they apparently provide, but which seem like they should just be included with a 3-star hotel). The one redeeming feature was the view,which we did really enjoy, as it has a fantastic view over the entire beach if you have an ocean view room. But again, it was mostly interrupted by heavy and loud construction throughout our stay, which was very disruptive. This was a very special trip for us, anniversary and birthday, and we specifically chose this hotel because we wanted a pool and some peace & quiet, so we were really disappointed to know that we had no pool and were woken up each day by the construction noise. The hotel does offer a complimentary access to their sister hotel's pool around the corner, but I felt that we should have been notified somehow before booking that the hotel was undergoing construction. Service from hotel staff was very good throughout our stay and location was perfect (right across from the beach!) but it was not enough to make up for the disruption and inconvenience. I don't think we'll be staying here again and we'd recommend to guests considering the hotel to stay elsewhere at least until they complete construction, especially considering the price.","Victoria, Canada","Laurin K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, Canada</strong>",84,2.0

The balcony sat two (we just used the luggage rack with a towel over it as an outside table). The bed was nice and pillows nice. There was enough room. It was definitely set up for leisure rather than work and I could see the table provided might be an issue for older people (but the staff really went out of their way to try to make any request happen).The hotel is currently undergoing some major renovations - jack hammers at 9am daily kept us from sleeping in. There was no pool access whilst they re-tile this area. The breakfast location changed and there was some variety in the pastries provided.

So up an elevator to the front desk. Our two rooms had been on separate floors; with a request to move to a room closer to my parents, they accommodated without hesitation and got us two neighboring rooms. Rooms were clean and bright. The elevator is a little confusing, but once you understand it, it's fine. Bed was comfortable and road noise was minimal (Waikiki is known for its road noise - late night parties and early morning deliveries to hotels make it potentially hard to rest) Breakfast is free, but very minimal.

There is no way to get any beach chairs in the hotel because they are gone at 7 AM (huge hotel and maybe 20 chairs...unbelivable). Chairs by the pool falling apart.

It's a great location but there are a few things that may be a bit irritating to some. Check-in was excellent. We had booked an Ocean Front Room (highly recommended) and requested a shower chair be placed in the room. The check in was quick, efficient and friendly and to our surprise, the shower chair was waiting in the room (many hotels where one is requested, often result in several reminders!) We found the room to be VERY clean. Bed linens were immaculate and the carpet was obviously quite new. The air conditioner worked well, although the WIFI was a bit spotty. I found a better connection by logging into the WIFI from the neighbouring room! The hotel, however, is a victim of when it was built. The hotel was probably built over 40 years ago and although it is obvious that upgrades (a relatively new shower stall for example) have been made, it is still a product of the 1970's. The rooms are relatively small; there is no room for a couch or even a chair. The balcony only has room for one chair and a foot stool. The bathroom is frustratingly small. The pool area was poorly designed and beginning to look shabby, although as we left, a massive construction area was being prepared to replace the pool deck. The pool was placed in an area where it only gets the late afternoon sun; but then again, the beach is literally across the street. Those looking for a ""quiet retreat"" should look at other places as the Tiki Bar and Grill is literally outside and underneath many rooms. The music from the bar is very loud but DOES end at midnight. That being said, TIKI's is a GREAT restaurant; a bit pricey but well worth the cost. I am NOT a fan of RESORT fees (aka Amenity fees). The Aston charges $23/day + tax. It included a ""Breakfast on the Beach"", which is basically a continental breakfast that you pick up pool side and take to your room, the beach or eat on a lounge chair next to the pool. It also includes room WIFI, use of a coffee maker in the room, unlimited DVD rentals, local calls, use of a very small fitness centre, a daily newspaper and the use of an in-room safe. All we used was the WIFI (spotty in our room) and the safe. Not great value for our $23. Free beach towels and beach chairs are also available, but more often than not, the chairs were gone early in the morning so I ended up buying my own. Beach Towels were always available but somedays, they ""ran out"" but promised they would be replenished in ""20 minutes"". True to their word, they were. All interactions with the staff was extremely pleasant. The cleaning staff acknowledged us in the hallway EVERY time we passed them. Once at the pool, a staff member who identified herself as a customer relations representative inquired as to our impressions of the hotel and if there was anything she could do. Our TV stopped working after the first night, but was replaced very quickly. Overall, we were quite happy with the hotel. Very clean, friendly staff, excellent location but a product of the decade in which it was built. Would we stay here again?? Most probably.","Edmonton, Canada","albertaguy2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",18,4.0

My wife has a hip issue and could not get in the chairs so there was nowhere she could sit in the room except on the bed. Our balcony had an ocean view but only one chair so we could not sit out there together, Whose bright idea was that?There is a mandatory ""resort fee"" which includes Wifi. But the Wifi connect was spotty at best. I had to do some work and during one session of an hour or so was kicked off more than five times, which made my work much harder. The fee also includes breakfast, which wasn't bad - adequate for me, but they limit you to one trip through the line so you better make sure you have what you want the first time. The breakfast includes boxed cereal, some fruit, average quality muffins and scones, coffee, tea and juice. Eggs and the like are an extra charge. There are no plates or trays so you need to be able to carry everything or stuff it in the little lunch bag they give you. The worst part of breakfast is finding a place to sit - there are not enough tables around the pool. On the plus side, a guitar player/singer and a hula dancer were a pleasant touch. Parking is valet only and is another added cost. I had no problem with the fitness center - it is relatively small but both days I used it no one else was there at the time. The pool is rather small but who would want to hang out there with Waikiki Beach across the street?No complaints about service. We did not experience the check-in delay described by other recent reviews and the people at the front desk were helpful.I know Honolulu is expensive but this place seems overpriced for the size of the rooms and overall quality. The resort fee and valet parking add an extra $50+ to the quoted price.We had dinner both nights at the Tiki Bar and ordered from the bar menu rather than the indoor restaurant which has a more extensive menu. We had good service both nights and enjoyed both the food and drinks. (Recommend the pork quesadillas.) There is a Wolfgang Puck Express down on the ground floor.Overall, if we ever go back top Honolulu we will probably look for a better place.","Haddonfield, NJ","Medstrike</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Haddonfield, NJ</strong>",53,3.0

The concierge assured us he will try to get our room available ASAP as check in was at 3pm- we were extremely exhausted!! We ended up sleeping in the hot sun near the pool as our room wasn't ready untill 3pm exactly. This wasn't a great start to our holiday we were so excited about. This was my least favourite thing about our stay here, but there isn't much you can do if a room isn't ready for you. I did try to contact the hotel in advance to work out a plan for the times, however I didn't recieve a reply. When we first walked into our room we were pleased with the size and beautiful view out the window ! My partner was extremely happy about the PS3 ! The bathroom could Deffinately do with an upgrade, as the shower leaked onto the floor after you finished, as it was only a shower curtain that didn't do it's job, so our towels were constantly on the floor so we didn't flood the bathroom ! The movie machine is fantastic!!!! We absolutely loved watching a movie before bed every night, it was a great way to end our busy days. The breakfast was very basic, cereals, fruit and juice were all we ate, which isn't worth the 23 fee. But I think the cooler idea is great! Be prepared to pay for hot food- eggs and waffles. As recommendation, the hotel should look into adding bacon and eggs onto the menu to please a lot more of their customers!! I know it would of made my partner a lot more Excited to wake up for the breakfast, as there would of been something he liked there. The staff are extremely friendly and always willing to help you out!! The aloha vip tour desk was so helpful, and helped us get the most out of our holiday so thank you!! The location of the hotel is fantastic ! You get to have a lovely stroll of the Main Street before you get to all the restraunts and shops. Most shops are open untill 10pm which made nightlife incredible as you roam the streetsOverall we were really happy with the service at the hotel, and the location, the beach across the road is beautiful.

Be aware the hotel includes a mandatory ""resort fee"" at check-in! I can justify a resort fee if the hotel is an actual resort but I don't think the Aston Waikiki is anywhere close to being a resort!! The resort fee includes: breakfast, wifi, gym. Please be warned, the breakfast is not great, box cereal, cut fruit and a few pastries which usual run if you're not down by 7am. The wifi is spotty better off using your data plan. And I've seen bigger and better gym facilities at some apartment buildings. Check-in is painfully slow, be prepared to wait in very Long lines!! Either they need to schedule more check-in agents especially during high season or need to provide efficient check-in training to staff. And check-in is 3pm, whether they have available rooms or not!! Be prepared to wait till after 3pm for a room. You will see families hanging around the small pool in the lobby with luggage waiting for rooms for most of the day.Worst of all, for a hotel that categorizes itself as a resort, the Aston Waikiki does NOT provide hospitality rooms for their guests to use after check-out. Clearly they need to take a tip from other 4-star resorts/hotels in the Waikiki area on providing hospitality amenities for their customers with late night outbound flights. You would think this would be included in the ""resort fee"". I even spoke with the manager on duty who could not even give me a clear explanation as to why this is the case for a supposed 4 star resort!! So I asked where I could freshen up and she pointed me to the outdoor showers by the pool with no running hot/warm water!! I asked if maybe I could shower in the gym, in private, with warm water? But guess what...the gym does NOT have showers! Really..and this is suppose to be a 4 star resort?? Do yourself and your family a favor and book somewhere else with better amenities and much better customer service. I was expecting a little more from Aston Waikiki but I was disappointed.

The cost was $3221.20 in total, that's $1073 each for 7 nights, daily amenities fee not included (has to be paid directly to the hotel AT TIME OF CHECK IN).Whilst there was technically nothing wrong with the room, that seems to be the only good thing I have to say. We arrived around midday and asked concierge to hold our bags (check in was at 3pm). Concierge did hold our bags but they were otherwise not very helpful or hospitable. We went upstairs to check-in which consisted of waiting in a long line of other like minded people who thought they would check get in early and beat the rush, only to be told that we would have to come back at 3 to be handed our room key which again consisted of waiting in a long line. When we got to our room it had 1 king size bed in it, for 3 girls. We had requested 2 double bed from the time we had booked the room 3 months ago AND we had told the staff at check-in that we needed 2 double beds. This was eventually sorted but not until various calls were made to reception. The room was far from modern, the shower is one of those annoying ones where you turn on the water and it goes straight into the bathtub until you pull the pin and get it to stream water to the shower head. There was a shower curtain, i thought these died long ago when some genius created shower screens. The carpet in the hallway was dated and smelt, moreover you could smell the Asian cuisine ( i hope it was cuisine and not the people) coming from some of the rooms. We stayed on level 12, ocean front room, the most expensive rooms in the hotel - only to realize that we had the longest commute from our room all the way down the smelly hall to the elevators (located near the garden view rooms). And not to mention the lift would require you to get out at Level 3 (Lobby) and get into another lift to go to Level 1 which was the level which you exited onto the street. The hotel is one of the last on the main strip of Waikiki beach, yes its waterfront but every time you exit your hotel there is still the usual homeless or beggars or drunks right in front of your doorstep. We had to be mindful walking home. The balcony had one chair on it. The bed was standard (nothing luxurious) and we did not once use the pool (small and uninviting). Tiki's bar & grill was popular for dining but we did not have the opportunity to eat there. The staff (excluding maids) were unhelpful. I needed to use the bathroom on NYE so I rushed to the lobby (instead of taking two lifts to our room and running down the hallway) and I was told that they are closed by 10pm, so my room key would not allow me to use the bathrooms in our own hotel, again the staff were rude and inconsiderate of this.Overall, it was very very average to say the least. I am struggling to find a highlight or even good thing to say. Perhaps the breakfast (included in your daily service fee) would be it. A selection of fresh baked goods, cereals and fresh fruits is available between 6am-9am, but that's not helpful to anyone who doesn't want to wake up early. A hot breakfast will cost you extra, plain omelette was around 6-8US$. And last but not least, smokers - don't bother. In general in Hawaii you can't smoke on your balcony or within 20 ft (6metres) of any door to a shop/hotel etc. You would think they had a smoking section at least, but no such luck. I can't count the number of times we were asked to move whilst smoking in the carpark/drive in area of the hotel. It was the only spot where you were able to sit to have a cigarette and enjoy it until concierge moved you onto the street (which was about 3 metres further out in front of the area which families and other tourists were waiting for their tour buses. Wi-fi, we all know how important that is when travelling. Wi-fi was good inside your room but the second you stepped outside YOUR ROOM (not the hotel) it would disconnect. You could get average connection in lobby and on level 1 (street level) by entering your email address each and every time you wanted to connect but it was not full strength. This is just unacceptable given that wi-fi is part of the service included in your daily amenities fee (a MANDATORY $25-28US a day). Overall just exceptionally poor in all respects. Would not stay there again, even if it was the only hotel available.","Sydney, Australia","elle_paras</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",8,1.0

Our a/c did not work for the first 2 days and was finally fixed on the 3rd trip from maintenance. Two of the rooms we had booked were inside as soon as you came off the elevators on the 7th floor so those rooms stayed cooler but our room was located on an outside hallway and the full sun was on the room most of the day so it didn't really cool down until later in the evening once the sun set. I was also not crazy about having a room that was outside, it felt very old school motel to me and I was not paying an old school motel price.

The hotel is pretty much like most other hotels in the area and you get what you pay for, similar to the Jetstar flight coming into Honolulu. I travel light and was permitted only 7 kgs of carry on luggage however there was always room for my favourite movie No Retreat No Surrender, which you may have seen. No Retreat No Surrender is a classic made in 1986 which is about a Bruce Lee fan called Jason Stillwell played by Kurt McKinney, who trains martial arts at his fathers dojo in Los Angeles called Sherman Oaks Karate. A crime syndicate (Van Damme) is trying to take over the dojo and although Jason's father is a black belt, he's not a huge fan of fighting so the Stillwells decide to leave LA. They move to Seattle where they encounter the same problems and Jason is continually being beaten up, similar to Daniel Laruso in the Karate Kid. Like Daniel, Jason seeks help to become a better fighter and one night, the ghost of Bruce Lee appears and teaches Jason everything he needs to know, for self defence only of course hihihihihihi. Jason takes on the Van Damme in the final scene to finish off not only the greatest martial arts movie ever made, but arguably one of the greatest movies ever made (Followed by Kickboxer 1, Wrong Bet/Lion Heart, Bloodsport and Kickboxer 2, Best of the Best and King of Kickboxers). I was extremely excited when I discovered the Aston provided DVD capabilities in the room. We landed in Honolulu at 6:30am and arrived at the Aston an hour later. I was hopeful and had my fingers crossed a room would be available so we could watch No Retreat No Surrender, however this wasn't the case. I was disappointed that there wasn't a movie room where you could play your movie whilst waiting for the room to be made. This could be an area of improvement for the hotel.Our room was finally ready somewhere around 10am which was a relief and the excitement levels were back! Not long after entering the room, I noticed there was no DVD player, rather a PlayStation which could play DVD/Blu-ray. I wasn't quite sure how I felt about this, I was actually beginning to be a little nervous. Although I am 32 years of age and have watched No Retreat No Surrender on average once a week, usually Monday nights or if I'm on a date, I started to ask myself - What if the movie doesn't work? What if the region settings are locked? What if I don't get to watch my favourite movie? There was only one way to find out. I placed the disc into the PlayStation and after a few flashing lights and selecting the right input mode on the TV, the NRNS logo appeared. What a relief. Soon I was on my double bed with my feet up watching one of the greatest stories ever told in one of the most beautiful locations in the world. What more can a person ask for? However, things were far from perfect.I started having trouble with the various functions such as pause, fast forward and rewind as I had to use the PlayStation gaming controller. The controls for the movie were not exactly straightforward which caused some frustration when wanting to pause or return to particular scenes. So another suggestion for the hotel would be to install proper DVD/Blu-ray players in each of the rooms, which would not only make watching your favourite movie a lot more enjoyable, but the overall trip to Hawaii also.","Sydney, Australia","JasonInHawaii</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",1,3.0

There is a long line of people selling tours but they did not want to help us wih directions in our car as we were not taking a tour. They also told us that a restaurant (Dukes) does not take reservations.The included breakfast, billed as breakfast on the beach, is a disappointment. This is provided on the pool deck and each room is given a small insulated bag. The premise is to take your breakfast and eat it on the beach, or anyplace for that matter. There is limited seating around the pool so the takeaway idea is probable to encourage people to leave as the hotel is pretty large. Food options are really, really, crappy. Cold cereal, Danish options, some fresh fruit, coffee, tea, juice, miso soup and that is about it. They have an omelet station and waffle station but they charge $7 for the eggs and $5 for a waffle.

Didn't care much for their beach chair/towel policy (return everything by 7)-- why not just hand them out and have guests return them at the end of their stay if they choose to keep overnight? But these are minor gripes for an otherwise great stay. Tip: Banyan tree parking is a good cheaper alternative to the hotel valet parking and only about a five minute walk away.

So while we got a good rate on the room of $161.00, the additional fees plus the GE taxes and the TA tax, we paid $235.00. That's a little high for checking in at 6 p.m., checking out at noon. In addition, this is the first bad experience at an Aston hotel. We have stayed often at the Aston Waikiki Beach and the Aston Waikiki Sunset over the past 20 years.Our room was advertised as ""partial ocean view."" That's ocean if you can see it over the palm trees. (Request tenth floor and above for good 'partial' view.) Also, was over pool so was noisy, and we also got noise from restaurant with live music till late at night. That can be acceptable if one is getting a deal. What was not acceptable was: 1) hair on bathroom counter, 2) hair in bathroom sink, 3) hair on bathroom floor, 4) dirt specks on bedspread, 5) TV that kept turning off, 6) hairdryer that did not work, 7) little bar stool table with glass top that kept sliding all over the place, 8) no other type of guest chair but bar stools, 9) only one chair on lanai, 10) Keurig coffee maker with NO decaf available, 11) skimpy bedclothes and lousy pillows.We have stayed often at the Waikiki Beach Hotel and always had excellent rooms and service.This time the reception clerk, Chris, was outstanding. The man running the valet parking, Wayne, was rude, short, interrupted me, was impatient and just so lacking in Aloha Spirit. The driveway was packed full of cars so I had jumped out to go register us and then back to front to see what to do about our car, which was still in street. I can still hear Wayne's impatient Heavy Sigh as I asked for help. I understood that it was very busy, the the valets were shouting out ""aloha"" as they busted their buns parking cars. He was even very rude and condescending to a non-English speaking couple.At checkout I stated my complaints about the room (cleanliness, things not working properly, lack of decaf coffee) and how kama'aina should not have to pay the full amenity fee, or at least have parking fee waived. That's when I found out that staying 2 or more nights will get both those fees waived. (Now I know.) But as far as the other complaints, all I could get was $5.00 off the amenity fee. And the gentleman at checkout was not very gracious about it, nor did he seem too concerned about my cleanliness complaint.So, as customers of Aston for over 20 years, I have to complain. The room should have been cleaner (it had been too long of a day for us to complain at the time...we just wanted to shower, and go to bed) and all amenities should have worked, and the bedding of a higher quality.

Up front they offer you free breakfast, free Valet parking, free wifi and $25 per day you stay with them (the put the total balance in a visa check card when you check out). The resort fee and majority of taxes also are waived. If you are married w a family check your TLA rates and your meal rates. Some folks don't know their total entitlement. The meals rate is a flat standard and you are paid it regardless. Some of their rooms are bigger than others so when you make your reservation keep that in mind. I maxed my TLA option and we are staying in a large suite (big family). They gave us two free upgrades to a partial ocean view with a lanai which is super cool. My wife and kids love doing spending some morning time out there and settling down at night too. The beach is 25 feet across the street and this side of Waikiki is a little calmer, so it's perfect for smaller children. The beach has a small wall to allow calmer waters for young kids swimming w/o strong currents. You can walk a quarter mile down the strip and it picks up so you won't have to walk far at all if that's what you prefer. There is a nice pool on the main floor (3d floor) with a restaurant (Tiki's) adjacent to it that has beautiful live music played every night. In the mornings Mon-Fri there is a guitar player and Hula dancer who perform during breakfast hours (really nice).

Still parking should be included along with any other lock and load amenite fees which include item the are standard at most hotels these days. Adam.B",,Adam B,0,3.0

I must say that if you are a family or an individual on a budget and looking to go to Hawaii but don't want to cost yourself an arm or a leg this Hotel will definitely do~! There are too many other hotels in Waikiki ripping people off. My favorite part about this hotel is the morning breakfast buffet. Upon arrival you get a complimentary lunch box. Just fill it up with the breakfast goodies and you are good to go all day! I would usually head out to different parts of Oahu thus, these snack and breakfast would come in handy in the car. However, if you are looking more than just a place to sleep perhaps you should look elsewhere. Besides did you come to Hawaii to stay in your room or to explore the island and its beautiful coast?

You can snorkel right over the breaker wall. The music can be noisy if you leave the door open, but it ends early enough. Breakfast was continental, but a nice option to just get the day started.

When we arrived we were told that our room was given away due to them overbooking. I was appalled considering that's not my problem, but the hotel's mistake. After refusing to be moved to a single bedroom, they gave us a double bedroom instantly, that they had had all along. Seems very sketchy to tell me that there are no rooms available, and then instantly produce one.The hotel also brags about amenities and the option of valet parking on their website. The amenities are an additional 23$ + tax a night which is not mentioned on the website. You have the option of finding your own parking, but good luck in downtown Honolulu, so you are basically forced to use their valet parking for $27 a night for valet parking. Basically, you'll be paying an extra $50 every night that they don't mention until you arrive.The only reason I'm rating poor is that the front desk staff was friendly, and the location is great. However, I could have gotten more for my money's worth.

Because this was our fourth time at this hotel in the last four years (2011-2014) and it was for my 40th birthday I emailed them to see if they could cut me a deal and they did. We booked a standard room and the hotel gave us complimentary upgrade to a partial ocean view room and 20% off which saved us around $300, not bad eh. Our flight got into Honolulu at 7am so we tried to pay a little extra to check in early but they wouldn't do it because they couldn't guarantee that our room would be ready before the normal 3pm check in time and sadly this was the case, the previous guests were still using the room when we arrived. So after wandering up and down Kalakaua Avenue like a zombie, or someone who didn't sleep at all on a nine and a half hour flight from Sydney, we asked if we could check in at 2pm and thankfully we could. Our room was on the 17th floor, now a lot of people complain about the hotel's lift (elevator) system, that it's confusing, complex and stupid but it is simple, easy and brilliant. All you have to do is swipe your room key card, press which floor you are on and the lift system will allocate one of the five lifts for you, A to E. This saves a lot of time for everyone since the lift goes straight to your floor or only a few guest's floors depending on whether you are sharing a lift or not and when you think about it, it's great security wise. We finally got to our room, it was at the end of the hall which was great because the lifts can be pretty noisy and that's where the standard rooms are, score! Our room had a very comfortable king sized bed, The room was very clean and in a good condition, and this year they have a Keurig coffee machine in each room which was awesome! One bad thing about the Keurig though, you only get two K-CUP coffee pods a day (unless you hassle a housekeeper for more) and they weren't very nice, we ended up buying our own from Walmart. We had a small table with two stools which came in handy when we ate in our room and/or used my notebook. The bathroom is small but manageable with a small tub and a shower with excellent water pressure though the hot water took a little while to kick in. Being a partial ocean view room we were located on the left hand side of the hotel towards Kapahula Avenue and the Honolulu Zoo. Our balcony was a small ""step-out"" balcony but you still had a great view of Queen's Surf Beach, the Waikiki Pier and the start of Kuhio Beach Park. The room also had a good sized tv which I think was about 32 inch (LG I think) as well as a PlayStation 3. When you check in you get a dvd rental card which allows you to rent free dvd and games from down in the lobby, it's great! Okay there were some negatives here I will admit. I wasn't happy that this year our room's wifi dropped out several times a day, one day it took half an hour before I got back online which was very frustrating. There were times when my notebook and iphone couldn't even find our room's wifi so we used the room next door and even the Park Shore hotel next door's free lobby wifi, shhh! The air con could get very cold which was great but it was very noisy and the on/off switch was a pain to use, you would stand there pressing or holding the button with your finger waiting for the air con to turn on or off which was annoying. I don't know what the go is with those bathroom basins with the pull up push down plugs but there were days when I couldn't get the plug to stay closed so I could shave. But all in all, the staff are very warm and friendly from the reception staff, lower lobby car parking staff, housekeeping staff, pool kiosk staff though the market store staff always looked unhappy and bored. I loved the housekeeping staff, they are always happy, do a great job, say aloha and good morning every time you walk past them so I was more than happy to leave a tip for them every time we needed our room serviced. We were very pleased to see that the hotel is finally renovating the surface around the pool, it was getting pretty bad and looking rather tatty. The Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel has an amazing location, great staff, awesome service, great views and all at a great price especially for that area of Waikiki. Although the next time we are on Oahu we may stay somewhere else for something different I highly recommend people, couples, families and groups to say here.

I have to say that 3 of the front desk people were exceptional and I would give them the highest rating available. I had an unfortunate accident during my stay. On the day of my daughters wedding (10/18/14) there was a horrible storm - it was supposed to be a hurricane, but was downgraded. The hotel is all open area's where rain could come in and saturate their slate rock floors. I tripped on their wet carpet - flying across the pool deck and dislocated my shoulder. Three people at this hotel deserve my ultimate respect and gratitude. Geri, Jeremy and John all witnessed my accident and came to my rescue. Soon after my fall, the bad area's were roped off with warning signs posted. I had hoped that I would have been offered some sort of discount to compensate for my pain, however, I was unable to speak with the General Manager about anything that happened. The hotel is lovely and convenient to the beach, but I feel that they let me down - not even offering to comp my amenities fees. If you stay here - try to stay during really good weather - I was not the only person that fell - there were 4 other falls that I personally witnessed before any warning signs were posted.

The decor follows a Japanese aesthetic: simple, straightforward, unfussy. Think also Sofitel. The room I used had a clogged tub drain that remained plugged even after housekeeping left a message indicating that the clog had been cleared. The bathroom was clean, though, even if the floor was particularly dingy. The beds were comfortable, but certainly not luxurious. My balcony had something of an ocean view once you were outside. It was not the sort of room that you'd linger in, but then you're in Waikiki so why would you do that?The elevators took some getting used to, but I liked the concept. By badging in and adding your room number, the elevator bank identifies an available elevator, which then automatically takes you to your floor. A combination of security and efficiency.I didn't use it, but there is a pool, and a poolside bar, which I did avail myself of.

There is a police station near there too, if you ever have any trouble. We did not have any issues with the staff, or rooms as they were prompt, and the rooms were well made, not a stain or speck of dust to be found. The rooms were also spacey, and easily had plenty of space for the entire family, at a reasonable price (considering the location and time of year we traveled). All in all its a great hotel, with a perfect location, and great rooms. ","Sydney, Australia","Albiilive</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",1,4.0

The first night we check in and they put us in a room with double beds(we booked a king room online) so we said we wanted a room with a king bed. The supervisor said they are all full. We were quit upset and said we should have gotten the room we booked. He then tells us the policy of 'No guaranteed rooms' and that he can switch our room the next day. (its 10:45pm at night when we check in) He gave us the option rudely saying he can kick other guests out of there room to accommodate us. He then finds a room for us with a king bed, we sleep there but couldn't sleep because of the strong smell of food. In the morning realize the room was directly over a restaurant. And there was a yellow stain on the sheets ! so gross! So we talk to the manager, she then switches our room but we had to wait till 3pm (wasting half a day to check in all over again) we get the room and the sheets are dirty! brown stain (we have pictures to prove it)at this point we are so fed up we get the maid to come change the sheets and we just stay in that room for the 3 nights. Not to mention concierge took 45 min to bring us our luggage, we call and find out they put our suitcases in anther persons room ! so frustrating when we want to enjoy our vacation. At check out we asked them about compensating us for all the hassle we went through at this hotel and the front desk said there is nothing they could do When we got back from our vacation i wrote to the head customer service and no reply... I would not recomend this hotel to anyone! waste of money!! terrible customer service!

The elevator system was very sophisticated; all you have to do is tap your room key and enter your floor and it will tell you which elevator to take. The rooms are very clean. The only complaint I have is the beds are a little small for 2 people. Each morning, we brought the free cooler bag down to get breakfast. There was a large selection of breakfast items including some local Hawaiian donuts which were very delicious. With the cooler bag, it was easy to take your breakfast to the beach or to your room to enjoy. There is also restaurants downstairs (Wolfgang, Tiki's, Subway) to choose from as well. There are also ample ABC stores around the block to buy souvenirs! There is also a small gift shop downstairs which is opened until 11 p.m. in case you were too lazy to leave the hotel. Transportation was convenient as there were taxis outside the lobby and the trolleys also stop right outside the hotel. Our stay here was very pleasant.

I always book my accommodation based on the overall Trip Advisor rating but in this case went to a lower overall rated hotel because of the location. I read all the reviews some of which were negative and rated the hotel quite poorly. However, my concerns and worries (based on some of the reviews )turned out to be unwarranted! The checkin was quick and professional with a very friendly staff member and all my requests were granted. We had requested interconnecting rooms, with two double beds in each, a late check-out and rooms from the 15th up. Three days before our arrival I had rung the hotel to reiterate my requests. Also 4 days before arrival, the hotel sent me an email where I could request upgrades - I did this for double beds at $5.00 per room and a late check-out for $45.00 (this would cost $75.00 at the hotel). We had booked partial ocean view rooms, which from checking with the hotel, I knew would only have standing room terraces. To get a full terrace you would have to pay more for a full ocean view room. We were more than happy with our rooms and we got our partial ocean view combined with a lovely view of Diamond Head. The rooms were a little tired but neat and tidy, quiet, of a reasonable size and well serviced every day. The bathroom was on the small side but more than adequate with good shower pressure and a great hair dryer. The only negative would be that the air-conditioning was on the noisy side although very efficient. The elevator system was excellent and rather than everyone squeezing into one elevator you were allocated a lift when you swiped your room card. We never waited for more than a few seconds and the lifts were never very full. The ""breakfast on the beach"" suited us perfectly, with a range of pastries, some bread rolls, yoghurt, cereal, fresh fruit, fruit juice, coffee and tea etc. All of which we would put in our complimentary chilly bags that were in our rooms. We never had to queue for long and always found somewhere to sit where we could watch the dancer and listen to the Hawaiian music. You could also hire (no charge) towels and chairs and take over to the beach. The Tiki Bar was always busy and popular with a good selection of food and cocktails. We had a quick late meal one night at the Wolfgang Express and this was great value with the fish and chips being actually nicer than we had at more upmarket and expensive restaurants. At check-out we were told our rooms were not available for late check-out but they could move us into a large bedroom with a big bathroom and plenty of space for four women and 8 bags. This was done efficiently with no fuss and mean't we could stay until 6.00 pm. Our check-out was a bit complicated with us wanting the bill divided 4 ways but Geri was outstanding, nothing was too difficult and she was so helpful and friendly.I would most definitely stay here again, the location was perfect (22 steps across the road to the beach), close to shops, restaurants, bars, the trolley bus right outside the door and Lulu's a great little restaurant just a few steps from the hotel.

I stayed there for 9 nights and had enough time there to give you my critique and recommendations.The breakfast included with the vacation package was a Continental breakfast. I was told that if it doesn’t say “Continental Breakfast,” then it is an American breakfast. Well, to my dismay and embarrassment, it was a Continental breakfast including cold cereal, yogurt, mini muffins and greasy scones and croissant, miso soup and ramen, mixed fruit, coffee and juice. There were few healthy choices to eat, all the food except the coffee was cold and nothing was cooked from a kitchen. There was little seating for this breakfast around the pool and we were forced to either sit in our room during the times it rained or on a banana lounger sharing a tiny table to eat breakfast, if there was even a table available. I heard other guests complaining about this not being a real breakfast and the lack of variety.The room was dirty, including:1. the bathroom floor had dust bunnies;2. the white bath mat was dirty from shoes having walked on it many times before I stayed in the room;3. there was mold in the shower and on the floor around the baseboards in the bathroom; 4. there were paint spatters on the floor tile from the last time it was painted; 5. chunks of paint were scratched off the back of the door leading to the hallway; and6. there was dirt on the room’s walls, door framss and baseboards. I have pictures to prove it.Finally, the hotel put our room across from the maid’s service room and the ice machine on the 6th floor, which made ice all night long and the maids were noisy at all hours of the day. Also, the noise from guests in the hallway in the middle of the night woke us up several times. Needless to say, I would never stay in the hotel again nor recommend it to anyone. Several guests complained about the breakfast, cleanliness, and the general condition of the rooms. I find it ironic that the Aston website says it has gone through a renovation. I shudder to think what the rooms looked like previously because they still aren’t, in my opinion, and I suspect from the conversations I overheard in the hotel, not acceptable for most people’s standards. I am surprised by some of the favorable reviews . . . I have pictures to prove every statement I have made.

On this trip I booked this hotel through Expedia. This hotel was given a 3 1/2 star rating. One of the things I have learned through my travels is the hidden costs that are not optional and not included as the room rate. That is the ""Resort or Amenities"" fee. This not an optional fee. At this hotel, it is $23 a day. Valet parking is $27 a day. Then there is a $1 GE Tax per day. Hence, my room rate was quoted as $219 + $61.16 in taxes and fees which comes to $270.16.On arrival, the valet advised me to call from my room to cut down the wait to get my car. I still had to wait even after giving a 15 minute lead time.Now for my thoughts on the accommodation. The room was okay. The furniture looked worn..the wood had very visible wear. The table was okay, but instead of chairs, there were two Asian style stools. They were not comfortable and probably not safe for older people. The bathroom tile floor was visibly in need of serious cleaning. The grout was almost black in some places.

You got a choice cereals/yogarts/several baked goods (purple rolls/muffins etc.) plus your tea coffee milk fruit juices. if you wanted anything cooked like eggs or toast you have to pay for. (boiled egg $1) The only thing that i found which was annoying was the lifts you scan your key card and lift is allocated to you and they seemed to take forever.

We were awed by picturesque sunsets over Waikiki and a prime view of the surfers tearing it up. For not having a formal dining area, Aston was very creative with their space. They offer buffet-style breakfast out at the pool and creatively suggest patrons utilize the beach across the street for additional seating. Of course it is included in the mandatory $24/night amenity fee. The Tiki was superb both the restaurant and the bar side(s). And the ""1944 Mai Tai"" was epic, best on the island. The menu is pricey, but the bar food is reasonable. Everything we had was great.By the way, there's also a mandatory $27/day valet fee for those with a car.So, if you're a driver, you can count on an additional $50+ day in fees and parking.All in all, a great experience.

You come out of the cool rooms and the hallways and lift lobbys are like saunas. The pool area looks very tired and dated, but with the beach across the road there were never too many in it.

I was a travel consultant for 25+ years and we've had the opportunity to experience most of the properties in Waikiki. The reason I highly recommend the Aston Waikiki Beach is the warm sincere Aloha welcome we received from all the staff and the effort everyone makes to guarantee the most pleasurable vacation. Geri was wonderful at check in and made us feel like we came back home for a visit with old friends. After watching the other staff it was quite evident that everyone was trying very hard to make visitors feel at home. Enough can't be said for Christina our housekeeper. She was friendly and cheerful no matter how busy she was and our room was always spotless. We love the Breakfast On the Beach concept because it's fast and easy with so many choices. We stopped and chatted with the tour desk people and they offered ideas on things to do and the easiest way to do activities. The Tiki bar was friendly and we enjoyed a beer every afternoon at Happy Hour after being at the beach all day. The Concierges desk was also very informative and able to give great directions for walking around Waikiki or which bus to catch to get somewhere. The nice lady that sells jewelry during breakfast was so much fun. I bought a beautiful necklace to wear on the plane and by the time I got home I'd had five strangers remark on how pretty it was and wanted to know where had I purchased it. I should have gotten a few more of her business cards. Really, the only thing we missed was a coin-op laundry on site. We purposely packed light but worked around that by just buying a few new things. Unfortunately we had to leave 5 days early because of a medical emergency but both my husband and I agreed that for the ten days we stayed at the Aston we had a wonderful vacation.

Breakfast was great eventhough it was a cold breakfast with no hot items (with the exception of some Japanese dishes) Was such a wide variety to choose from that it really didn't matter that it wasn't hot. Was so nice being able to take your breakfast down to the beach eventhough we chose to listen to the musician and watch the hula dancer poolside instead. Was really nice having WIFI in room and to be able to rent movies for free. When I asked for more blankets they were at my door within 2 minutes and when I didn't know how to use my DVD player the serviceman was there in 2 minutes as well. Loved the security elevator feature as we usually had our own elevator since there were 6 elevators and you swiped your card to make it only go to your floor. Excellent location to walk to everything in Waikiki Beach. I can't see how anyone could possibly complain about this hotel. Depending on when you arrive the front desk at any hotel might get swamped but if they are doing their best to serve each customer in a friendly manner with 100% of their attention then that should be forgiven and not held against them. Also, just about every hotel in Waikiki Beach has a resort fee so that shouldn't be a shocker either or be held against them as it's becoming a normal occurance even in Vegas. I give this place 4.99 stars. The only small thing that wasn't perfect was that the room was smaller than most rooms I've stayed in before. That really didn't bother the 2 of us much though as we aren't there to spend 100% of our time in the room so it was good enough for 2 people and the balcony and view definately made up for the less space inside the room.

For our last week we had wanted a quiet and relaxing experience, and our stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel helped us achieve that.The hotel is located in a great spot, right opposite Waikiki Beach and in walking distance to bars, restaurants and other attractions. We had an Ocean View Select room on the 22nd floor and had great views of Waikiki beach and the ocean.The room was spacious and comfortable, and even with 3 open suitcases and bags of shopping everywhere we never felt cramped. The 'Select' rooms also offered a complimentary set of drinks and snacks on arrival, as well as free wifi (good speed and strength) and free use of the in-room safe. The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. The free breakfast, which I believe is the only one offered by any hotel in Waikiki, had enough variety to meet the needs of all types of eaters. Cereal, pastries, fresh fruit, yoghurt and oriental options were available at a buffet by the pool, and all rooms receive a souvenir cooler bag so you can pack it up and eat your meal by the pool, in your room or on he beach.The pool was nothing special, especially since the beach was right across the street. The only nuissance was the resort fee that was debited daily from our credit card, however I believe this is a fee that all hotels charge when you're in-house and there's no avoiding it.

I have never stayed at an Aston hotel before so I thought I'd give it a try. At first glance it looked great. I thought I made a great choice. Well after 14 hours on a plane I wanted to get to my room ASAP. Had my hopes up since there were 2 people in line. For some reason it took close to an hour. Part of there problem is the backwards checkin system. The elevator has to be explained to every guest. Then the forms and explanation of the resort. I just wanted to go to bed.I have to say that the staff...all the staff were excellent. They would have so much less stress with better systems. Then I get to my room. I thought I would relax and turn on a movie. No such luck. You have to go to the lobby to get your movies. They are free but it is a pain.In the morning I went to grab their continental breakfast. This is simply terrible. A few muffins, pastries, cereal...Normally that would be fine but the pastries was tasteless. Everything tasted the same. I tried it 2 or 3 times and I had the same result.Once again, the staff was excellent but here is an issue Iran into 2 or 3 times. I like coffee. They give you 2 individual cups. I wanted 4. I usually left a note. If they did not leave 4 I would try to find one of the house keeping staff. I guess the supervisor is pretty strict. I had to negotiate at times. Not hard core. I think it's their policies.OK so there are negatives but the view is incredible. You are where the action is. It's the perfect location. You will have a great time and you are surrounded by great restaurants.Would I go back? Probably, I know what to expect, loved the view, and they provided excellent customer service.

At check-in a full working staff meant no long lines and minimal wait.I discovered I misplaced my photo ID and the gentlemen at the front desk sensing my frustration put me at ease by simply asking me to verify the information I provided on my online reservation. Within minutes he processed my paperwork. He was efficient, quick, and made the my check-in transaction stress free. Exceptional service delivered with a smile and the aloha spirit. We booked a standard room and were upgraded to a partial ocean view. From our balcony we marveled at the tranquil blue pacific and watched surfers ride the waves. I could have easily sat there all day to admire the awe inspiring vistas. And the room amenities did not disappoint. Fast WiFi connection, A/C, flat screen HD tv, comfy pillows/beds, and a decent sized mini refrigerator. The décor reflected a tropical chic, modern theme without compromising the Hawaiian flair. In my opinion the hotels designers succeeded in providing an authentic island atmosphere. Lobby furniture decorated in native tapa print, lime greens, and teals with a backdrop of surfboards cleverly spelling out the hotel’s name. Verdant walls with bamboo added to the visual appeal. The hotel’s location is idea, just across the street from a gorgeous stretch of golden sand beach perfect for families who appreciate calm pool-like waters. There are no shortages of places to eat in the area and Tiki’s Grill & Bar and Wolfgang Pucks are on the hotel grounds. For those who use public transportation, buses are a short block away on Kuhio Street.I have to mention the hotel’s elevator system. At the lobby I simply entered in my room floor, swiped my room key card, and automatically was directed to the next available elevator. With six operating elevators, we rode directly up to my floor, most of the time without other guests. An ingenious system which is the first I’ve seen at any hotel.A plus was “Breakfast on the Beach”. The concept is simple: fill a plastic portable cooler (which the hotel provides and you can keep as a souvenir) with breakfast food items and choose to eat in room, picnic on world famous Waikiki beach across the street or lounge and dine in the pool area with Hawaiian themed live entertainment. The continental breakfast consisted of the familiar selections and also included delightful Hawaiian choices. Macadamia/vanilla, coconut Kona coffee and passion fruit juice. Pastries also featured traditional local favorites: poi glazed donuts, okinawan andagi donuts, taro sweet rolls. Available choices of mango, guava, lychee, haupia yogurts. Tropical fruit included island pineapple and papaya. Also Asian guests appreciated the Japanese miso soup, furikake musubi, Korean kimchee, cold soba noodles. It was a generous selection and an energizing start to our day. The Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel met our expectations and our overall experience was positive. The hotel emailed me a short survey a day after we checked out. Upon completion, I received an email from local management acknowledging my input and an invitation to return. It wasreassuring to know my opinion was valued and my business appreciated. The hotel’s desire for feedback demonstrates their willingness to analyze guest reviews and recognize the importance of online social media reputation. What would I do differently if I stay there again? Not a thing, it was close to perfect. Well, maybe request a room facing iconic Diamond Head and definitely book a longer stay.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Abe A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",33,5.0

The hotel was AWESOME. We had a high floor, lanai and amazing ocean view. The room was pretty small, but we weren't ever in our room! Had a fridge, that's all that we cared about! The bar downstairs had some yummy food and drinks, but the night we went they happened to be having a private party which interfered with our service. The location is great, it's at the end of the ""Strip,"" so you are still in all of the hoopla, but far enough away to still feel like you are in a quiet tropical paradise. Valet wasn't priced too bad so we used it the first couple of nights, then moved on to the free street parking down the road. Exploring hawaii via rental car is one thousand times more convenient then public transportation. Worth the extra bucks to not have to cram on and off a bus and not go where you want to go, or stay longer somewhere to swim/explore. Did I mention this hotel offers included breakfast!?? It's SO great. They give you a little cooler, so we would stock up on fruits and pastries before hitting the road for the day.

The front desk person, Geri, was so nice at check-in. We were stressed because my monther-in-law was in the hospital and we were worried and had missed celebrating our anniversary a few days before. Geri upgraded us when our original room wasn't ready and was kind and empathetic. Our room, an ocean view on the 22nd floor, had a gorgeous view of Waikiki beach from the balcony. (It would have been nice to have more than one chair on the balcony.) The room, while not overly large, had a nice, comfy bed, and small, very clean bathroom. Having a refrigerator was a plus - we walked to a grocery store and bought sandwich makings and drinks so we could fix our own lunches. Hotel service was excellent - when we arrived, we noticed a running toilet and also the air conditioning was stuck at 67 degrees. A friendly maintenance man arrived quickly and all was well!One of the things we loved was the ""Breakfast on the Beach"" program. We were provided a small cooler bag which we could fill each morning by the pool with individual cereal packages, yogurt, a great assortment of pastries (excellent scones!) and even malasadas, fruit salad, and miso soup. There were also various juices and coffee. All can be taken to go across the street to the beach. We stayed by the pool, though, and started our morning listening to the excellent live Hawaiian music and watching the lovely hula dancer. Great! We ate dinner at Tiki's restaurant on site twice because we liked it so much - be sure to reserve a table by the outside railing and enjoy the sunset! There is also a Wolfgang Puck's Express on the first floor, as well as many nearby restaurants.This hotel is at the quiet end of the beach (near the zoo), but you can easily walk to the other end, either along Kalakaua Avenue or along the beach itself. We walked to Diamond Head along nearby Monserrat Avenue and hiked up to the top of the crater for awesome views (the whole thing was about a five-mile round trip from the hotel). We also took The Bus out to Hanauma Bay for a day of snorkeling. The bus stops almost across the street from the hotel - so easy! We also rented a car one day (good price from the on-site tour desk) and drove around the island, with our favorite stop being gorgeous Wailua Bay.All in all, this hotel is perfectly situated and a good value for its location and views, and we would definitely stay here again.","Sunnyvale, California","Jeanette1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunnyvale, California</strong>",173,4.0

Did not call down cause thought maybe it was just me. After reading other reviews I realized this is an ongoing issue with this place.Slow check in. When we checked in only 1 person at the desk and about 3 people in front of us. Geri was amazing however.Not the hotels fault but boy is there a lot of homeless camped out up and down the beach.In the big scheme of things we spent more time out and about so really the room was just used for sleeping.

She originally checked us in and found a room for us at 8am straight off our flight from Australia, so we didn't have to wait until the 3pm checkin! We had booked a partical ocean view room & got the most incredible room that was more than a 'partial' ocean view, it was more like a 'whole' ocean view!! Our room was directly above Tiki's & we never heard a peep to keep us awake. The bathroom was not the flashest bathroom ever but when you consider the price, the incredible view & how much time is actually spent in there, it was no big deal! Most importantly it was clean & tidy.The breakfast service was nothing special but lovely nonetheless, and we made good use of the cooler bag by stocking up for two breakfasts, allowing us to sleep in every second day! We didn't use the pool, only because the ocean is literally 50 steps away so why bother!! We both loved this place & my sister had already started planning her return trip before we'd even left!!!

We sat on the balcony for a few minutes in awe.  On our return from our cruize, we stayed for another night.

The room was nice and up to date. The hotel is like right across from the beach where we walked over and strolled along the seashore, mornings and evenings.

The good: LOCATION is what sets this place apart. The hotel is located right across from the lagoon and is a much quieter portion of the beach when compared to the center of Waikiki beach which is jam packed in the busy season. There were people around but not so much that we couldn't enjoy ourselves. Starbucks is right downstairs which was a huge bonus for me. Our ocean view room had a terrific view of the water and the Waikiki strip. We had a problem with our air conditioning twice during our stay and the front desk staff and maintenance responded quickly and were very nice.The not so hot: The resort fee. The complimentary breakfast is pretty much worthless. We only went down once. Its all sugary pastries. Pool area is just so-so but this is true of almost all of Waikiki. After all, the fabulous ocean is RIGHT THERE. Be prepared to wait for your car.

The cost 'covered' a coffee machine in our room (which two did not work) a newspaper (that was never delivered to our room) WIFI that did not work, after numerous complaints to the front desk it never got fixed. TV and play station that we never used.We booked and paid for a 'full ocean view room' which apparently means a view from the side of the building with a balcony you could not fit one chair on.In one room we booked a King side bed, instead we received two very small double beds instead.

I had just moved into our room with my 2 year old and husband. I was barefoot in the room and stepped on broken glass. I called the front desk and they sent up security with a first aid kit and house keeping. My foot was bleeding. House keeping vacuumed the area and security gave me antiseptic and bandaids. I removed the shard of glass from my my foot and security also found glass on the ground. I filled out a report and was told management would be in touch with me. I was told Management would be in the office two days later. Management did not contact me that day, the day after, or two days after. On the third day before check out- I contacted the management myself. I explained what had happened and the manager said she was doing all that she could. I asked her what she was doing about the situation and she mentioned that she had apologized and would contact the insurance company that handles all claims. She also 'offered' me to sign a form saying that I am not looking for compensation. I, at that point, was very offended and did not trust that anyone would contact me to offer an explanation and try to make my stay more pleasurable. The manager had told me that the insurance would now deal with any of my complaints. I told her I don't need medical insurance since I'm from Canada and can go to the doctor without being charged. I was left with more questions than answers. I do not understand why I wasn't treated with more respect and why I wasn't contacted earlier. Why was my room not vacuumed? Why was there no follow up? Why was this ignored? I have, since returning back home, received an email from the hotel manager who has offered me a refund for one night. I do not think it is worth saving money in order to risk safety of my child and myself. I do not know if the glass has Hep. A or could cause an infection. I feel it is my responsibility to inform families who respect and trust customer service, safety and hygiene to avoid staying here.

Waikiki Beach is right across the street and you can check out a towel at the hotel so you don't have to bother with packing your own. There is a litle protected swimming area there that is great for kicking back and children. Actual waves to boogie board are to the left but still very close by. Check in was longer than expected and outdoors, so it's HOT and there isn't a place to sit while waiting. There is a great station to rent DVD's for free and use the Playstation to play them on a low key night. Some have mentioned problems, but we didn't have any. Our TV remote was fickle, but still worked.Our room (#1204) was small, but very functional. Lots of drawers and little places to put clothes - and lots of hangers. It wasn't necessarily ""dirty"", but wasn't clean either. Lots of caked on dirt in the bathroom and around deck. Deck was nice and had a view. Small, with one chair and ottoman. Big enough for two people to relax for a wee bit. The air conditioning was okay and definitely cooler than it was outside, but not that blast of cold air I've grown to appreciate after a hot day in the sun. It did the job, just not as well as I'd hoped. As many have mentioned, the breakfast really is disappointing. Pre-made pastries that aren't very appealing, fruit that was cut way too early for serving so it looks 'recycled' and not much else to speak of. Oh - the cold cereal with milk was the food highlight, along with the vanilla macadamia nut coffee (only one by the soda machine) was really good and a welcome improvement to the rest of the hotel coffee. They did have daily music at breakfast with a singer and hula dancer which was a nice touch, but I'd still rather spend the automatic $23 at Tiki's or Lulu's for a hot breakfast.Housekeeping missed our room twice and was quickly remedied once notified, but it was just frustrating to have to do it. There was no consistency as to when we would see them either - sometimes at 9am, sometimes not until 4.30pm, once the majority of your day was done.Overall, I'm not amazed with my experience, but not bummed out either.

However, I was hesitant on the location bc it's at the end of Waikiki and the beach in front of hotel has this ""rock wall"" making it not ideal to play in the water. This made us walk about 5 blocks up to find better beach areas (near Moana Surfrider hotel). I didn't like being at the end of Waikiki bc it was ""far"" from everything. The valet is extremely slow and there's no self parking. It's always busy in the lobby area bc there are a couple of casual restaurants in the building, which is great, but crowded. Pool is mediocre and doesn't overlook the ocean (there's a restaurant in front of it). Although the room is cheaper than most in Waikiki, you have to pay for wifi, bfast (normal), use of the safe, in-room coffee, and use of fitness center. Check in took forever. Rooms are TINY and not that great. Pillows are thin and the sheets have that foam blanket in between vs a real comforter (indication of cheap hotel). Furniture is old and dark; not cheery like the photos online. Bathroom is tiny and shower has curtain (another trait of cheaper hotels). Beds were fine since I slept alone and my friend in the other, but if was traveling with my bf I would not want to get too cozy in these beds. Air conditioning is old and horrible. I set the thermostat to 65F and it's probably about 74 in here. It's VERY noisy at night. U can hear people in the next room, outside on the street, and in the hallways. I was in room 1805 and upgraded to an ocean view room which is not a true ocean view and if this is an upgraded room, it's not that great. Noise is really a problem in this hotel. Bad sound insulation. I will never choose this hotel again. Id rather pay just a bit more and stay at a nicer hotel like a Marriott, Hyatt, Westin, or Starwood property.

We were able to check in early, coming from Australia we do not pay a separate 'amenity fee' so was a little surprised as we were charged extra for items we barely used. Anyway, we were 'upgraded' to an undisclosed room, we walked in and had a partial beach view, which was absolutely breathtaking when you get to step out on the miniature balcony. GREAT! Thanks so much for an upgrade to a room you cannot even enjoy the balcony and weather and the view as there's nowhere to sit, can stand two people max on there. Really annoyed, as every other balcony had a chair and big enough to enjoy and was functional. Was upset at that. Breakfast, well, perhaps front desk should have disclosed you needed the provided freezer bag for breakfast, as the first morning we struggled to hold our food, find a spot to sit I mean we coulda used our balcony but DAMN can't really use it hahah! Ridiculous. The pool area needs revamping, it's also awkward that it is right where the lobby is..where front desk is. Didn't like that, so didn't use the pool at all. Beach it was!

Service was excellent and prompt when needed, chamber maids were thorough and generous with towels and bed changes, and the complimentary breakfast each morning was enough to start my day right and set me on the way to the beach right across he street!

The parking staff is also very good.The view - We had 'partial ocean view' and it was great.CONS:Food - The free breakfast is so bad I stopped eating it after day 2. Bad coffee. No one expects bad coffee in the land of Kona coffee. Low quality, tasteless fruit. No one expects bad fruit in the land of pineapple. Low quality, tasteless muffins and pastries. The only good thing... tofu and pickled cucumber one day and possibly noodles and veggies another day. I don't know if the noodles and veggies were good or not because they ran out of them before 8 a.m.Service - Nonchalant. There were two incidences of things missing from our room. Security was sent to the room for the first one and a report was written. They were concerned and helpful but no one else was. The second incident I was sure was just a matter of a white shirt being left on a bed getting accidentally scooped up with the sheets. I asked at the front desk about a lost and found, a physical place where lost things were kept. I was told there was such a place and connected to housekeeping. Later that evening housekeeping calls back to say the person who cleaned my room didn't find anything. Well, of course not, but that's not what I asked for. I didn't pursue it because I didn't want to ruin my vacation, but I certainly didn't appreciate the handling of it.The property - Old and worn.

I also had a small balcony which could only really squeeze 2 people on if you were sitting straight up and not stretched out so if you see them advertising the room has a balcony do not think that this is a luxury, for me on my own however it was a perfect size. Check in isn't until 3pm which is really un realistic when guests arrive at all times of the day there were a lot of tired travellers always lingering on poolside waiting to check in so be aware if your arriving early on your stay, however the hotel did try their best to have to room ready quicker but they will not come tell you, I had many repeat trips to reception. There are toilets in the lobby to partly freshen up after your travels.Tiki bar is part of the hotel complex which is a very very popular bar on the strip the food, entertainment and drinks deals were amazing the whole week, bar staff a little distracted and a bit slow for service but they made amazing cocktails, so if your looking for a holiday where you don't want to travel far from the hotel for fun Aston is definitely a good option by having Tiki bar.The key card service for the hotel was a bit of a nightmare they don't work fluently and sometimes could take up to 9 10 attempts for the card to open the door I had to replace several during my stay.A good facility is the free poolside and in room wifi. The complex is perfectly clean which is a must for me. The breakfast on the beach is an amazing attribute to the hotel you get given a cooler and they open the buffet at 630 and you can fill up with as much as you like, which was also perfect for early morning tour transfers, I could grab the food and run for the bus. Be prepared to queue though I got caught out a couple of times, when getting early morning buses, the queue goes down fairly quickly but people do like to be there at 630.The hotel is at the further end of Waikiki strip I would suggest staying somewhere a bit further up the line if you don't want to walk far as it is also one way roads so if your mobility is limited this could be an issue.The walk to the beach took 2 minutes which was amazing it almost felt like the beach was a part of the hotel this really brought my opinion of the hotel up. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the hotel its clean and the staff are extremely friendly. You are on the main strip of Waikiki and a 2 minute walk to the beach and most tour transfers do pick up from the Aston. I just felt like for the money I spent the hotel didn't live up to what I would of expected for the price.","Christchurch, New Zealand","StaceyL98</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Christchurch, New Zealand</strong>",30,3.0

The other hotels we wanted were booked, so we picked this one due to the location. Sadly, the location was the only good part of our stay as it was right across the street to the beach. Our first room was very small, with a tiny bathroom looking like it had not been refurbished in 30 years. Old, cracked tile on the floor, very dirty grout to the point I did not want to even walk on it. Our shower had moldy grout. The bottom of the tub was worn and stained and also grubby looking like you would not want to stand on it. We got in so late that night, and were too exhausted to change rooms. Bed was uncomfortable. We changed rooms the next day, and got ""upgraded"" to an full ocean view. The down side was we had to check out of the first room, and had no room till after 3; when I went to check in I had to wait 30 minutes in the sun (so hot) to get the new keycard. Not the way I wanted to spend the little time we had... The next room was marginally better, somewhat cleaner, but very tired and worn out looking. Same uncomfortable bed. That night we could not sleep, as we were above the nightclub on the 12th floor. Crazy loud even though we were so high up. Great view from the room though. We stayed at the Hilton many years ago, and it was so nice- very disappointed as we paid just as much for this room and had such a bad experience, and this was supposed to be a trip for our anniversary. Parking was not free- cost $27 a night to have your car jammed into a space- also you could not leave when you wanted as it was so busy at valet.

We did not get the rooms we thought we had reserved, but our rooms were fine. We were on the 16th floor facing west & had lovely views of Waikiki beach. Everything is quite convenient to this location - the beach is literally right across the street & there's lots of shopping within walking distance. There seems to be an ABC mini market on almost every block, which is great to get sun tan lotion & cheap souvenirs. The swimming pool down on the 3rd floor (13 floors below our balcony) was surprisingly noisy in the evenings until quite late. The rooms were acceptably clean - nice white bedding, firm mattresses, lousy pillows. Our air conditioning did not keep the room cool & we were not able to adjust it. It always read 65 degrees, even when I'm sure the room was 80 degrees. We requested servicing of the A/C, which didn't really help. The bathroom could have been cleaner - we kept a towel on the floor, as it was stained & did not appear clean. The tub had a bit of mildew, which wasn't surprising, considering the humidity. The hair dryer blew only lukewarm air (fortunately I brought my own). Our maid service was hit & miss - we spilled a bit coffee on the bathroom floor the first day, & it never got cleaned up during the 6 days we were there. The maid would also often forget to leave toiletries & would never leave refill k-cup coffees for the coffee maker, unless we left a note requesting it (we left a generous tip each day for housekeeping anyway). There were no washer/dryer facilities, which I would have expected in this price range. We liked that we could sign for towels at the pool & take them across the street to the beach (you are charged for them if not returned). Expect to be charged $27/day if you have a rental car, as there is no other parking besides valet. Each room is also charged a $23/day amenity fee, presumably for the continental breakfast. The ""breakfast"" was the one thing we were very disappointed with. We are a very easy to please family, but this ""breakfast"" was the worst ever! There was almost no protein - we were hoping for at least some hard boiled eggs. What we got were strange purple donuts, cold cereal, super sweet yogurt, overly strong coffee & strange little noodle containers (possibly for the hundreds of Asian tourists we saw). The life saver for us was the Starbucks right around the corner, where we got excellent coffee & breakfast sandwiches.Overall, it was pretty nice & I might stay there again.","Parker, Colorado","Cutes12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Parker, Colorado</strong>",20,4.0

""We"" are a family of four: 2 adults, one 18-year-old male, and one 13-year-old female. This hotel is located on the easternmost end of Waikiki, closest to the Diamond Head end of the beach. This, therefore, is a ""pretty good"" location, though it is a good walk from the most expensive and posh end of the shopping and beach complex. If you're going to Honolulu to hit the most expensive and high end of the shops, then this hotel is not conveniently located for you. Also, the hotel is about average in condition, etc. Let's face it, Honolulu in general, and Waikiki in particular, has lost a lot of its shine. Much of it is rundown and not well maintained. While this hotel is definitely not in the ""rundown and not well maintained"" category, it is showing its age and getting a bit shopworn. While our room was clean, there were soiled areas on the couch arms, chipped paint on the doors, old and worn bathroom fixtures, etc. Staff was very nice but the front desk needs more folks on it. I frequently observed lines of 5 or 6 or more waiting to check in or otherwise interact with the front desk folks. The view from our room was quite nice. We faced west, so we looked right out toward Waikiki Beach and the center of the tourist and shopping maelstrom. The ""Breakfast on the Beach"" is not on the beach. Here's how they work it: In your room there will be a couple of small six-pack type cooler bags with shoulder straps. You take this down to the pool area and each person gets to go through the buffet food line once and only once. You can take all you can carry in your hands and your little cooler bag. There's no hot food to speak of. Bread, cereal, fruit, that kind of stuff. Not bad, but not extensive or fancy and the only way it's ""Breakfast on the Beach"" is if you decide to carry it downstairs to street level, go out of the hotel, cross the road, and get over the to the beach on your own. Staff was nice and friendly and helpful but busy. Tour booking is convenient. I recommend Ron at Expedia. He helped us a lot and didn't steer us wrong. He worked hard to get our tours scheduled and juggled around so we could do everything we wanted to. But, I strongly suggest you make your bookings and reservations in advance, before you arrive in Hawaii. First, it's cheaper; and, second, you won't miss out on anything. We had two tours we almost couldn't do because everything was booked up on some days. If you stay at this hotel, there's a Starbucks and a Subway and a Wolfgang Puck in the same building complex and block. It's a block from the Honolulu Zoo, which is a nice stroll some afternoon when you're tired of touring and would just enjoy some quiet time in a beautiful setting. Diamond Head is just east of the hotel but you don't want to walk to it. The entrance is a long way uphill and around the back side of the crater. Take the #23 bus or a cab. The bus was $2.50 per person and a cab will run you maybe $5 per person. Or, sign up with Uber and go that way. If you do go to Diamond Head, take the hike up to the observation post at the top rim of the crater. It's a strenuous hike and it was hot the day we did it but it was fun.","Houston, Texas","edwardsjbe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",48,3.0

Check in was not too long. When we checked in, they upgraded us to a larger room which was great after getting off a 9 hour flight. Our room was ready and with the extra space, our luggage was out of the way. We had a partial ocean view room on the 7th floor which still gave us a beautiful view. The hotel was relatively quiet and the beds were comfortable. The room was starting to show a little wear, but overall it was a nice room. The breakfast was good with a nice assortment of continental breakfast items plus items like fresh fruit and fountain soda (which made my husband happy). We ate breakfast on the pool deck where they had someone playing Hawaiian music. It was nice. While we did find a seat, the pool area is relatively small and I saw a lot of people taking their breakfast to their rooms (did not see many going to the beach). On our last day, we asked for a late check out. The Aston may do this, but with a $25 fee to check out by 2:00. My only real complaint about the hotel was how they handled the cars in the valet area and the space to pick up tour buses. Downtown Waikiki is busy and I get that, but for 3 days, we had to weave in and out of cars that were coming in or to be valeted. The entire front entrance way was chaotic. Also, when we called to ask the bellman to get us a cab, we came down and he had not called a cab. (Not a huge deal as you can usually flag down a cab.) The hotel is across the street from Waikiki beach and next to the zoo. The are several decent restaurants in the area. The ""main"" shopping and dining areas of Waikiki is about a 6-8 block walk (or a $10 cab ride for 3). One nice touch the hotel had was lemon and orange water all day in the lobby. There was also a convenience store to buy sodas and snacks. Would stay here again.","Crystal Lake, Illinois","Green24</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Crystal Lake, Illinois</strong>",146,4.0

It was at the end of the hall and I guess it just got missed. Towels were delivered promptly when we called. The lunchbox provided in the room is a wonderful idea to pack breakfast for the beach. All the appropriate containers were by the food in the buffet so it is easy to pack your picnic breakfast. Many restaurants and shops are within walking distance but if you choose to stay close the Tiki Restaurant serves great food.

We even enjoyed a view of Diamond Head when we went to get ice around the corner of our room!!! There was street noise, but it was blocked out as soon as we shut the sliding glass door. The elevator system was unique and cut down on crowded elevators; was no big deal to use it. The room and hotel itself though could stand to use some polish. The room itself was not spacious; I would like to see an added shelf under the sink in the bathroom; there was a safe & refrigerator, but no microwave. There was minor damage to the bathroom door, but did not impact our stay. Beds were comfortable. The beautiful view made up for the deficits. We took advantage of the breakfast deal; packed our cooler with pastries, juice, milk & coffee. Then went downstairs to Wolfgang Puck Express for omelets to round out our breakfast. The location was great; dined at the onsite restaurant Tiki's Bar & Grill the first night (delicious meal!); walked across to Kuhio Beach & shopped at local ABC stores for souvenirs; down the street from Leonard's for malasadas and nearby plate dinners at Zippy's and Rainbow Cafe. The staff were all friendly and pleasant; provided us with extra towels & pillows as requested. A special ""mahalo"" to valet attendant Bartz as I thought I had lost my SLR camera; he walked me down to our parked car & we found the camera just where I thought I left it. But he went above & beyond to calm me down & attended to my concerns. He was even kind enough to have our car ready by check-out so we didn't have to wait long, to risk being late to the airport.

They have ranged from 2 stars up to 5 stars. So I have a pretty good idea of what lodging in Waikiki is like. As for our last visit which was in May of this year, we chose to try the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel. The location is had to bet for the price! I have to admit that I too was surprised at the $23 per day “resort fee” that was not included in my prepaid package booked through Hawaiian Airlines. I asked about it at the desk and was told that it was a mandatory fee. The desk clerk was very apologetic about any misunderstanding and pointed out to be that it was in fact spelled out in itinerary. As they say, read the fine print! Just as a note, I did some investigation on some of the other hotels and their resort fees and it turns out this Aston has one of the lowest. Sheratons were anywhere from $30 to $35 per day! It seems to be the last way to stick it to the tourists! As for the Breakfast on the Beach; I have to agree that it was less that wonderful. You are stuck in a long line of folks whom I am sure had never eaten before! It was obvious by the way the stuffed insulated lunch bags (provided by the hotel and are in each room) with as many pastries, yogurt and dinks. This was in addition to the heaping plates they managed to carry off. The coffee was fine, but not worth the trouble of dealing with the cattle calls. Use the Keurig coffee maker in your room! This hotel has been around for a long time. It shows some wear but it is undergoing some updating. We found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating. As an example when we checked in I politely asked if it would be possible to have a room on an upper floor with one of the nicer views in our partial ocean view category since we would be there for 9 nights. She checked and said that if we didn’t mind changing rooms after the second night she had a very nice room that she would move us too. That sounded great so we accepted the offer. When we got to our first room it was very apparent that it had not been renovated. (Tip here is to make sure you ask for one of the newly renovated rooms) The bathroom needed some work and the carpet was worn, etc., but we have stayed in far worse and paid a lot more. The view of the park and Diamond Head were incredible! One the third morning I checked in at the front desk and asked about our room change. The clerk found the note and said that we would be moved and asked for my cell number so she could notify us when the new room was ready. Again great customer service! Within a few hours I got the call. As it turned out the new room was on the same floor but just across the hall from the first room. The big difference was that this room had been completely re-done and had a fantastic view of the ocean and the beach! The view continued all the way to the Royal Hawaiian! One of the best views I have had for these prices. Tiki’s Bar and Grill is located on the second floor of the property. It offers one of the best beach views in the area. The prices are about average for Waikiki and the food is good. The bar has a great happy hour with beer and mixed drink specials. Overall I would recommend the Waikiki Beach Hotel to anyone who wants a reasonably priced hotel with a great beach side location. I know we will stay here again!","Reno, Nevada","Rick D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Reno, Nevada</strong>",6,4.0

A few things note worthy about the Aston was the checkout on second floor was open air, the staff very friendly, however there was always a line and it took us 30 minutes to check in ? Then comes the crazy elevators . You wave your key in front of a pad and it tells you elevator abcde ? Took forever. Then where's breakfast ? Well if you call it that , it's continental no hot anything served by the checkin and pool . Pitiful for a hotel of this size. That's ok, we found some really nice places to eat.

The rooms have had a bit of a facelift it would seem & they are nice, quite a good size & with a huge comfortable bed. The bathroom performed all required duties flawlessly but it was a little tired in appearance & if you have come to admire the bathroom rather than the room view you may well be a little disappointed, this to us was of no concern.Once again the lift system impressed us, we found that often we had a lift to ourselves. The extra level of security afforded by this system is laudable & well worth the 10 seconds or so you have to initially invest working out how to use it.As with our last stay we found all staff we encounted a pleasure to deal with.The breakfasts we also enjoy & as part of your amenities fee which so many hotels charge now actually offers something material you get for your money. We felt there was possibly a little less variety than 2 years ago but not a huge difference, standard cereal packs yougurt fruit salad quite a large range of muffins pastries etc various juices & pretty decent coffee, not bad really & always enough to provide a little lightweight lunch as well.Last but not least must mention Tikis Bar & Grill which we liked already and on this holiday they also provided the best meal I had while on the Waikiki leg of our stay.","Hamilton & Waikato Region, New Zealand","Melnp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamilton &amp; Waikato Region, New Zealand</strong>",34,5.0

HA!) right on the beach - what is great about this hotel is you are within walking distance of all the shops and restuarants and it is a main hotel pick up area for all of the tour companies in Waikiki. The hotel itself was lovely, our room was spacious, the beds were comfortable and rooms were serviced to a high standard. The hotel also offers a complimentary breakfast and provides its guests with a 'cooler bag' which you can go down to the breakfast bar and pack full of fruit, yoghurt, crossaints, cereal, muffins, juice, water, tea and coffee etc - the hotel also provides bags and containers for the food to go inside your cooler bag. We really thought the breakfast bar and cooler bag idea was fantastic. We saved a tonne of money not having to go out for breakfast every day (which can get very pricey after a week or two).

While waiting on our housing to be ready we stayed at this hotel. I am only halfway through my 32 day stay here but wanted to write about this hotel during this busy PCS season to inform everyone how military and family friendly this hotel is. Up front the offer you free breakfast, free Valet parking, free wifi and $25 per day you stay with them (the put the total balance in a visa check card when you check out). If you are married w a family check your TLA rates and your meal rates. Some folks don't know their total entitlement. The meals rate is a flat standard and you are paid it regardless. Some of their rooms are bigger than others so when you make your reservation keep that in mind. I maxed my TLA option and we are staying in a large suite (big family). They gave us two free upgrades to a partial ocean view with a lanai which is super cool. My wife and kids love doing spending some morning time out there and settling down at night too. The beach is 25 feet across the street and this side of Waikiki is a little calmer, so it's perfect for smaller children. The beach has a small wall to allow calmer waters for young kids swimming w/o strong currents. You can walk a quarter mile down the strip and it picks up so you won't have to walk far at all if that's what you prefer. There is a nice pool on the main floor (3d floor) with a restaurant adjacent to it that has beautiful live music played every night. In the mornings Mon-Fri there is a guitar player and Hula dancer who perform during breakfast hours (really nice). During the weekends you can watch parades from your room lanai, the pool area, from the beach or by the street! Restaurants all close by with plenty of shopping and things to do during the day/night/weekends. When I go to work my wife is able to enjoy the hotel amenities and Waikiki beach.

Front desk staff did not appear happy being at work -- it shows with the lukewarm welcome you will constantly receive anytime of the day. To be fair, this was observed during our week stay alone. The staff may be happy and welcoming on other times, who knows?Worst thing, my wife suffered a back injury during our stay at this property. Their front desk is on an upper floor level accessible by an escalator or an elevator. An elevator which needs instructions to which floor level to go. Due to this, most people prefer to use the escalator even with their vacation luggages. On our way down to walk on Waikiki beach, a group of teens had checked out and decided to take the escalator. One of them had accidentally lost handle on her large, heavy suitcase. My wife and I were about halfway on escalator going down when we heard a scream from higher up from us and helplessly saw a careening luggage. My wife was hit square on her back and was violently shoved down the escalator stairs until she reached the bottom. Needless to say, it was a horrifying experience for us at this property. Other than the paramedics being called by the management, there was no offer of any consolation or compensation for cancelled tours nor a hotel compliment except for approved late check out on our last day. We had suggested for the hotel to have a bigger sign (much bigger than the current 5""x8"" placard) to say luggages not allowed on escalator or maybe an attendant that watches the area to prevent future accidents.

Our room had a small lani with a beautiful view of the ocean along Waikiki Beach. They provide an continental breakfast included with room costs. Staff was very pleasant and helpful. My selection for this hotel was due to its reviews on Trip Advisor, the cost which included continental breakfast, its location across from the beach and along the main street within this district, but primarily the fact that it was within one block of St Augustine by-the-sea Catholic Church.

Truly a great value and glad we found this place. We will stay here again next time.A tip on the air conditioning. We discovered the thermostat was set for 75 which is a little warm for our taste and could not be adjusted. Fortunately, the maid showed us a little work around. Grasp the thermostat with both hands and it pulls off the wall. Then give it a few seconds to reset and push it back in place. Now you can set it as low as 65 and it works well. It will revert back to us and you will have to do the procedure again a least every 8 hours.

We stayed in an Aloha Suite which had two Full beds and nice size living area with a sleeper sofa. This is perfect for us as the two full beds do not generally allow us good night sleeping for all 4 of us. Our kids are 13 & 17. The room was clean and well appointed and our balcony view towards Diamondhead was beautiful. The hotel breakfast was OK but nothing great, consisting of cereals, breads, coffee , juice & milk. There are several restaurants within 2 -3 blocks of the hotel and we would go and get some sausage & egg biscuits to add to our poolside breakfast. The walk down to teh main strip is about 5-6 blocks and we walked down several times daily. You will notice an abundance of homeless people along the sidewalk, but this is everywhere, not just the Aston. The hotel bar nice as well and a good atmosphere there. The staff was nice and accommodating, check in was easy, and the elevators very fast. If you have never been to Waikiki Beach, the sand is very difficult to walk in and there is coral under the breaks. It is pretty to see, but there are much better beaches on the island. I canb say that if you are averse to Buttocks, then the beach is not for you. The Dental Floss Bikinis are very popular, whether large or small butts.  The Zoo is across the street and it is worth the $$. Spend about 4 hours there. My brother lives in Oahu, so we will return to the Aston again. It is an excellent value and I recommend it for families.","Athens, Ga.","Pinecone62</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Athens, Ga.</strong>",34,4.0

For starters, the hotel is priced very well considering its on Waikiki beach, where everything is more expensive. Its located near plenty of shopping and eateries. It’s the last hotel on a strip of hotels near the beach so it’s closer to the less crowded area than most of the hotels on the strip. The absolute best feature of this hotel is the elevators. You simply scan your card, type in the floor number, and a specific elevator will take you where you need to go. This is great because you won’t be waiting for an elevator forever, just to find it too crowded to get inside. I rarely waited for an elevator for more than two minutes, and I was on the twentieth floor. I read reviews that the rooms were small, I do not understand that. My wife and I had more than enough space and our king sized bed was very comfy. I guess if you have kids you may want to get a suite, but otherwise there is no need. The breakfast was very nice. I like the fact that they give you a nice cooler to fill up with breakfast food and you can take it on the beach. The hotel also gives you beach towels and beach chairs that you can check out. A small con I would say was the front desk was always busy. The staff was friendly and helpful but I think they were understaffed. The only major con I would say is I’m not a fan of Waikiki beach, it was just too crowded and it was more like a busy city area than a relaxing beach area. If you like places like New York City or Chicago you will like Waikiki, if you want something quieter, go somewhere else. I’m not going to downgrade a hotel just because I don’t like the city it’s in though. We did a cruise of the islands and I liked Maui much better than Ohau, if I go back I’ll just go to Maui, maybe Kauai also. If Aston has a Maui location I would definitely consider staying there.","Amarillo, Texas","Joe806</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amarillo, Texas</strong>",15,5.0

Let's face it, just remove the pool from the upper deck - it was not used the week we were there, and I had a good view from my deck. The pool gets filled with breakfast remnants each day, and just did not look like a place I would want to swim.- overall hotel condition: there was a leak in the ceiling down the hall - I looked up and saw soggy ceilings in our unit too, bathrooms need updating.

The front desk customer service was about the worst I've experienced. Also, if you book a stay at this hotel via booking.com be careful, the price I booked was different than the confirmation I received from the hotel (there are issues with taxes and fees in fine print that make the totals in-congruent be sure to read the fine print) and then the final outcome. Also the hotel charges you an extra $23/day ""amenities fee"" - this is NOT included in the daily rate you are quoted so be sure to add that to the daily rate you are quoted and add tax too.If you stay here, ask for a room on the 25th floor with an ocean view. However, know that what you request is not guaranteed on arrival. You may request a king bed and end up with a room that has double beds. To change rooms, you will be required to check out before noon and then check back in again at 3pm... which means you need to re-pack, leave your bags at the front desk and then check-in again and unpack again... they won't just transfer you to another room (or at least did not give me the option to do so considering I stayed there an entire week - it never happened...) not ideal if you are travelling long distances and just want to relax. Also, the rooms don't a have desk/table with proper sitting chairs - so no chance to sit down and get any work done if needed. Hit the Starbucks next door you will be better off there.The Hotel is not located on the beach - it is across the street from the beach. If you want a beachfront resort where there is access to the beach from the property then I would recommend: Outrigger on the Beach - Waikiki, Westin Moana Hotel on the beach, Royal Hawaiian, Sheraton Waikiki on the Beach. There are a lot of shops and restaurants close to these hotels too. Plus they have restaurant/lounges on their property which are beachfront and have access to the beach. So depending what ambiance you are looking for make your choice.There is a 24hr Fitness a couple blocks from the Aston that has beachfront views and charges $69 for a week pass. It was a great gym - super inspiring and perfect for working out.Near the Aston is a Starbucks :-) Wolfgang Pucks, and Subway, plus a good breakfast place located above the Starbucks called ""Lulu's"". The hotel breakfast is weak and the line-ups are not worth it... You are better off going to LuLu's next door above the Starbucks and get a view of the Ocean plus full service - the eggs Benedict, omelettes and traditional breakfast were all great there!The beaches across the street are good. One has a wave barrier which keeps the water calm which would be great for kids who want to play in the water. To the left is a regular beach and great to hang out if you want to experience some waves and good crowds. The Honolulu Zoo is also near - if you have kids it might be good - I did not visit but it was very close walk.","Basel, Switzerland","KOtravel2013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Basel, Switzerland</strong>",41,2.0

I felt a bit cramped. Since we were only staying one night, this wasn't a big deal, but if we would have been staying for longer, I know it would have gotten challenging. Staff was great and wish we could have stuck around for the poolside breakfast; however, we wanted to get to Pearl Harbor and we checked out by 6am.","Germantown, Wisconsin","Elizabeth V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Germantown, Wisconsin</strong>",4,4.0

I 1st stayed here in 2004 & going back in 2014 everything was just about the same. As always I check out the reviews to see what may have changed & see what other people had to complain. But, like my last stay I was impressed with my room as well as view. Except this time I was on a higher floor Room 2501 booked an Oceanview Room (the view I had was consider partial ocean view back in 2004 because Oceanview back then was room right along Kalakua Ave which is now consider Oceanfront Rooms) it was a corner room so I had the best of both worlds....open the room door to see Diamond Head...Aston Waikiki best value is location and amendaties. They serve daily breakfast but you can pay a small fee for Omlettes made to order....This time they tact on Resort Fees $168 & some change with taxes. Make use of the DVD/Video game kiosk since it is included in the resort fee. We usually did when we came in for the night, but the movie always ended up watching us....lolThe location is excellent, plenty of places to eat and the hotel bar are restaurant were very good with a good Hawaiian automosphere. They provide valet parking service at $27 per day but instead of renting a car consider the public transportation as the hotel is on the main stop for shuttles to get around. The check in was fast & friendly...even though we weren't on our Honeymoon he gave us the gift since it was my boyfriend's 1st time there he treated us like Honeymooners. The elevator key system, seems pretty confusing at first, but it actually keeps the elevator from being over crowded. I think a little clearer signage is needed coming from the guest floors back to the lobby or street level as there really isn't a ""1st or 2nd"" floor and if I'm not mistaken I don't think you need you room key to come down. All and all I think with just a little clearer instructions inside the elevators or on the guest floors would help. Also a better indication of what elevator you need to take to the ""lobby"" that doesn't require a key cardOtherwise, everything else on the property was just how it was in 2004 but I am sure they remodeled since then.Although, I feel Waikiki Beach isn;t the same as it was 10 years ago. There more commercialized stores that now is taking over. You don't get the Hawaiian feel anymore. They have taken alot of local shops & restuarants out to make it more high end. I felt like I was in Beverly Hills instead of Hawaii. So, when booking tours take advantage of the island tour as you will see what the City of Honolulu is like besides the resort area.So, I am sure if I visit again it'll be a major change in the area as well....","Minneapolis, Minnesota","arylicious79</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",0,5.0

Like my last review I usually stay at the bigger chain properties and I have have been finding out that hotels like Aston and Aqua have really made me always now seriously consider staying at their hotels. No Four Season but the value I feel is considerable considering location and amendaties.I do quite a bit of traveling and have racked up a bit of expedia points which I never really considered to be that much of a value but more of a marketing gimmick. Not the reason I book travel or hotels but decided to use them here anyway. I was upgraded to a Ocean front room on a high floor. I have stayed at a few hotels in Honolulu and this room by far is one of the best I have had in regards to a balcony view. Couldn't ask for a better view of Waikiki beach. I probably wouldn't have paid for the room upgrade because you never really know exactly what your going to get but I don't think you could ask for a better room view anywhere else.The location is excellent, plenty of places to eat and the hotel bar are restaurant were very good with a good hawaiian automosphere.Valet parking service was good and always timely. Someone mentioned in a previous post that with a AAA card you get free parking, well you have to book that package and the rate is exactly that much higher per day, so it's really not a discount. I do not think there is any self parking on the property which is one downside to this property. But with the crazy traffic there it's one thing I didn't mind not having to deal with.The check in is kind of odd being on the upper floor and right by the pool. But It seems to work. The other odd thing that I have never seen before is the elevator key system. At first I thought wow what a confusing mess, but it actually moves pretty many people very quickly through the hotel. I think a little clearer signage is needed coming from the guest floors back to the lobby or street level as there really isn't a ""1st or 2nd"" floor and if I'm not mistaken I don't think you need you room key to come down. All and all I think with just a little clearer instructions inside the elevators or on the guest floors would help. Also a better indication of what elevator you need to take to the ""lobby"" that doesn't require a key cardIn summary I would highly recommend this hotel and seriously compare the Ocean front room rates to any other hotel in Waikiki, You won't be disappointed","Dayton, Ohio","cousinit8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dayton, Ohio</strong>",9,5.0

I think people need to be a little more realistic with their expectations given the nightly rate. The hotel is a little older, but we felt it looked updated quite a bit! Our room was very clean, the bed super comfortable and the balcony had a perfect partial ocean view! The included breakfast isn't anything special, so don't expect bacon, eggs and pancakes. It's more like cereal, muffins,fresh fruit and doughnuts. Oh and sushi or miso soup if you like that sort of thing in the morning?Halfway through our stay the city experience a main water pipe break which left us without any water and when it did return it was scotching hot - for 2 nights. It wasn't the fault of the hotel, but they were more than helpful and willing to move guests to their sister hotel or around the hotel to other rooms once the situation slowly started to resolve. So given that experience, I am still giving it 5 stars because the staff, rooms and location really are great!!! If I had to say anything bad about the hotel, it would be the fact that their main desk is on the 3rd floor instead of in the lobby on the first and the elevator system is a little annoying - you have to flash your card and select your floor to call it.

Really uncomfortable trying to watch a movie, had to try and fold it in half so we weren't just laying flat. Invest in some new and additional pillows! Our balcony was about a foot and a half wide.

The Aston is in a good location, but it felt like a place that was just housing tons of people. The staff were rude and unfriendly. They always acted as though we were asking too much of them. Their breakfast is the biggest joke of all. Besides no seating...... Other than fruit and muffins you will pay extra. They also don't know how to keep anything full and yet they have only had it open for an hour. Hate to see what a couple of hours brings. I always read reviews of places I stay and I always have thought man people you are so picky.... You are on vacation. But after being at the Aston I couldn't help but write a review to tell others to shop a different place to stay. You are in Hawaii and everything is so expensive to begin with, however, when there is no customer service with what you are paying I am sure you can find a better hotel to stay at.",pipestone,"SFredagent</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>pipestone</strong>",4,1.0

Across the street is Waikiki Beach, how do you do better than that. To the east is Kapiolani Park. You can go for a quiet walk along the beach, you can visit the Aquarium or the Zoo. Head west and you are in the heart of Waikiki with all its sights, sounds, and activity. The westward view of the beach from our room was nothing short of spectacular Their staff is outstanding. Everyone in all departments from housekeeping, to guest services, to bellmen, to maintenance, to reception, and security supported our holiday in a very friendly, efficient, and professional manner. We were always greeted with a smile and “aloha”. Thank you to Thelma, Liza, Mia, Pilar, Nora, Justin, and all whose names we cannot immediately bring to mind. We must also mention the excellent room. The king size bed and pillows provided us a wonderful night’s sleep from day one of our holiday. Relaxation is a big part of what we want on a holiday and the comfort the room provided was right on the money. We were fortunate to have the same room we had had before and were very impressed with the renovations. The room was updated and bright without losing any of its comfort or character.Breakfast-on-the-Beach has continued to be a great feature for us. It was our treat to bag our breakfast and take it to our room so we could enjoy it on the lanai overlooking the bay. The musician and hula dancer added such a beautiful ambiance.Have to say the elevator system is a real bonus. Another great idea! Easy to use: swipe your room card, enter your floor, and the system assigns you one of five elevators. There were no mobs cramming into any available elevator or entering an elevator that had all the floors pushed. It didn’t take very long to learn and after that it was a piece of cake.The free towel and chair service deserves mention as it makes a day at the beach so relaxing. There are plenty of restaurants and take out places within a short distance. At the Aston, Tiki’s Restaurant & Bar provides superb food, service, atmosphere, and live music daily. Teddy’s Burgers, Wolfgang Puck Express, Fursato, Seafood Village, and many more are within a short walk.",Edmonton,"mscholtzEdmonton</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton</strong>",29,5.0

A Keurig coffee maker is provided and they are supposed to provide you with two free coffee pods each day. Our bathroom was quite tired and could do with a thorough scrub down.....needs up dating. We had quite a few housekeeping problems and it seems housekeeping generally is lax and not well monitored or managed. They provide a morning breakfast of mixed fruit which mostly ends up being melon, yogurt, cereal and various pastries. The pool looks nice although did not use it.

From memory it was about $25 for the night. On previous trips we had sometimes used the Roberts shuttle. but we learned that it would take ages if you were staying at a property towards the end of Waikiki (as opposed to HHV or Ilikai where it would probably be a good option).We had booked an Ocean View room with balcony and it was very nice. The property was a little older, like many in Waikiki, but everything was good in our room, We had a balcony with a great view over Waikiki. The room also had one of those Keurig coffee machines that are popular in the US - they make a decent coffee or hot chocolate from the 'pods' the hotel provides.We had never stayed at Waikiki Beach Hotel before, but had been to Tikis Bar and Grill several times on previous trips to Hawaii. Tikis has great service and a nice atmosphere. We have enjoyed Mai-Tais and Lava Flows on their terrace bar and had hoped to do the same on this trip. Unfortunately we had picked up some kind of bug in New York and were too sick to enjoy Tikis on this trip.The hotel provides a breakfast that you can eat by the pool or take over to the beach in a cooler bag the hotel provides. We enjoyed the breakfast by the pool, which had plenty of decent choices.We would definitely stay here again, There are ABC stores across the road which sell beer and wine and practically everything else you might need.. If you are heading to the airport the next day, being at the end of Waikiki means that you just need to go one block to Kapahulu, turn left then head up to the H-1 freeway..","Canberra, Australia","dominick517</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",66,4.0

Nice flat screen tv, a table and 2 stools plus a good sized cupboard and safe.Bathroom was clean and adequate. LOVED the King Sized bed! Sooooo comfy!!! Linen was clean and crisp.We stayed on the 23rd floor and looked down Waikiki Beach. I think when your booking accommodation in Waikiki and your on a budget you have to decide whether an older place on the beachfront with views or a newer Hotel but a couple of blocks back with no views. We choose the views and glad we did. Spectacular!Tikis bar on the ground floor was awesome, a really nice vibe all the time.Breakfast served next to the pool was great. Plenty of choice and plenty of food. You can take the chilly bag from your room and fill it with food and then take it to the beach to eat.

Spacious room, ocean view. Clean, quiet. Balcony is for views only, very tiny.We needed an overnight accommodation which provided easy access to Waikiki Beach. We had just completed the Norwegian 7-day Hawaii cruise and wanted to visit Pearl Harbor before our return flight the next day. The Bell Desk arranged shuttle service to Pearl Harbor and the next morning to the airport. Both shuttles were prompt, courteous, and efficient for us. The Shuttle to Pearl Harbor was Round Trip and gave us flexibility for the return trip when the launch to the Arizona Memorial closed due to high afternoon winds. Disappointing, but we met our primary goal of catching the local shuttle bus over to the new Oklahoma Memorial, right beside the Missouri Battleship entrance. Our daughter-in-law's great uncle died on the Oklahoma during the attack, so this visit was crucial. (Get local shuttle bus ticket at the Arizona Visitor Center windows and catch the shuttle just a few yards/meters to the right).The Bell Desk also has a reasonably secure luggage storage area next to the Bell Desk. Since we were very early arrivals for check-in, this was very important and appreciated. On site restaurant provided a great meal. Noisy and very busy, as expected, but part of our overnight experience. The wait time was about 30 minutes, not bad for a busy Saturday evening. Chilly and breezy weather meant outside seating was less desirable, probably contributing to the wait time.The complimentary breakfast at the pool on Sunday morning provided expected pastries, coffee/juices, cereals, and cut fruits (melons). Suggest getting to the buffet early, as the cut fruits were scarce by the time we arrived there. As advertised, you can take stuff over to the beach in the provided cooler bag. Just be sure to leave the bag when checking out or a fee will be charged.Elevator system was efficient but a bit confusing at first. Specific elevators are for service between the arrival level (1) and the desk/pool/restaurant level (3). Escalators also nearby. For service to room floors, wave your room key by the call panel, enter your desired floor, and WATCH FOR YOUR ASSIGNED elevator. Once in the elevator there are NO buttons for floors.Bottom line: This was an excellent choice and a great value for our vacation.","La Crescenta, California","Wizzzzzard</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Crescenta, California</strong>",43,5.0

BUT I have to say, if you are going with children (from 2 to 21) they will WANTto be on WAIKIKI! We have just returned from 2 weeks in March 2014 at the Aston Waikiki Beach with our daughter and her boys (5 & 8). The Hotel was the BEST we could have hoped for. The Reception Desk was pleasant. The pool on the 3rd floor was beside Tiki’s Grill – the BEST casual restaurant on Waikiki where EVERYTHING was good, and it overlooks the ocean! The hotel offers FREE – DVD’S (NEW!), FREE Nintendo Games, a FREE full continental buffet breakfast, and FREE towels and beach chairs. They have a lunch snack bar for minimal cost with sandwiches and hotdogs. Below the hotel is a Subway, a Coldstone Creamery, and a Wolfgang Pucks Pizza Place! It is a great place to walk down Kalakaua Avenue and see the Duke and many other statues, beautiful plants and Banyan trees. An ABC convenience Store is on every corner and many shops and stores to see. The Hotel is across the street from the Honolulu Zoo, and is the main Trolley and Bus Stop for most transportation. The beach is beautiful at that end. For small children there is one side with a break wall where they can play in shallow water, and on the other side of the pier, there is more undertow and waves for older kids that want to try their surfing and snorkelling. We stayed in a “partial ocean view” for $145. A night, which gave us a room with doors that opened onto a 2 foot balcony. Not enough to sit on, but had the beautiful ocean breeze, great view, and could dry our bathing suits and shoes out! Our King Bed was SO comfortable, and our daughter’s adjoining room had 2 double beds and was great for her. There was plenty of dresser and closet space, and a mini fridge and hairdryer.

Thus when it was time to stay on Waikiki again we chose the Aston. This time around they have a mandatory 'resort fee' that you get to pay upon arrival. $23 per day. I'd be okay with this if it were not mandatory but where it is mandatory it really should be included in the room rate since you can't have a room without paying this 'fee'. It is to be noted that other hotels in the area do not charge a similar fee, they just charge a rate and offer similar resort amenities. Myself, I think they do this to get a lower room rate on internet sites. That said, factor this into your plans when you book and you may find a better deal at a better hotel. On to the review!The room was clean. No fooling. VERY clean! No dust anywhere to be found, the bathroom was spotless and it stayed that way, the beds were comfy and the linens smelled fresh. The tile in the bathroom is old and needs to be replaced and some attention is needed to some peeling paint in the bathroom (room 1612 in case anyone cares) but everything else was pretty good. The view from this room was of Diamond Head and was great! The noise from an air conditioning system from the next hotel was loud enough to make us keep the door closed all night so we missed the night breezes but still enjoyed the view. The balcony is large enough for two people to stand on it but there's not enough room for a chair. Leaning out on this balcony you get an ocean view. The breakfast (NOT complimentary but part of that 'resort fee') is okay. Yogurt with tropical fruit flavors, local donuts and simple pastries, along with cereal and freshly prepared fruits make for a passable continental breakfast. For an additional $7 you can have an omelet - but we never tried that and instead opted to just have the light breakfast. Japanese breakfast items are also available for a change if you want. Ten years ago the breakfast was more substantial with egg sandwiches included but times change. Juices, tea, coffee, and milk are also options. The live music by the pool at breakfast is probably one of the better features of the breakfast and even if you get bored with the breakfast offerings I'd recommend getting a cup of coffee and staying to enjoy the music. It really sets the mood for a Hawaiian vacation! The location right across from the beach affords awesome opportunities during the day. Some of the best snorkeling we did on this trip was across from the hotel in the lagoon where we saw trigger fish, a five-foot long moray eel, a four foot long coronet, thousands of schooling goat fish, a huge puffer fish and more. A few hundred yards east near the Natatorium we saw innumerable game fish and we even saw turtles in the water. Easy access to Diamond Head, Waikiki shopping, Kapiolani Park, the Honolulu Zoo, and the Honolulu Aquarium are all major benefits of staying here. The Wolfgang Puck Express restaurant downstairs is excellent and well-priced for a quick service place that serves upscale food. The downside of the location are the numerous homeless people who've staked out claims to territories on the sidewalks, planters, and at the picnic table areas across the street from the hotel. The begging is non-stop, the smell of urine in places is extremely distracting, and a general feeling that you're not very safe after sundown is a bit disquieting. Not that the Aston can really do anything about the homeless people and the other rough types that come out after sundown, but you need to consider this if you plan on any night time activities on the beach. Me, I'd recommend against that idea and tell you to stay in the crowded and well-lighted areas of Waikiki after sundown. I'd also say that I'd keep my small children close after sundown. Oh, and by 'after sundown' I mean IMMEDIATELY after the sun sets! No kidding, you can watch the families melt away from the beach and watch the unsavory types filter in not ten minutes after the famous and fabulous sun sets. As we walked around on this trip we checked out some of the other properties along Waikiki and the generosity and ohana (look it up!) of the hoteliers along the way was pretty amazing. We were welcomed and treated as guests at the Wyndham Waikiki Beach Walk where they welcomed us with fresh leis! We were also welcomed at the Royal Hawaiian, the Moana Surfrider, the Hilton Hawaiian, and the Hyatt where the hotel staff was most helpful with our rental car. We'll absolutely consider these hotels (and the Wyndham which is a condo hotel) for a future stay. In closing the question I leave with is what would make me come back to the Aston over all these other places? 1. Ditch the 'resort fee' and just make it part of the room rate instead of playing some silly game with me. 2. Improve the breakfast just a bit. Raise the room rate if needed, but make me happy about it in return! 3. It really is time to update the tile in the bathroom. 4. Nag the local politicians to get the homeless and their urine off of the beach! Otherwise it makes sense for me to stay at a resort that fronts on the beach and makes the homeless unwelcome. Disclaimer to the 'sensitive types': Yes, I know the homeless need to be somewhere. That's true. But when I pay good money for my only vacation of the year I don't want to spend it on having to deal with aggressive panhandlers, urine smells permeating a beach area, and having to step over people flopping on the sidewalk 24 hours a day. I can see that in California for free.","Sacramento, California","PeterFinn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, California</strong>",27,3.0

It's also located at the end of Waikiki which is a little quieter area. You can easily escape the crowds by walking a block to the zoo and park area. It's also right on the route of many shuttles and tour buses, which we found very convenient. The hotel is an older building which has some updates and is generally clean, bright and pleasant. Unlike a previous reviewer I liked the ""Breakfast on the beach"". They give you a small cooler to pack up your complimentary breakfast, and have beach chairs available to take across the street to the beach. Coming from -15 degree weather in Minnesota, eating breakfast on Waikiki beach was pretty hard to beat! Besides, the hotel doesn't really have room for everyone who wants free breakfast. It's a very creative solution to a lack of breakfast space, I think. The hotel has a strange elevator setup; you scan your key card and punch in the floor you're going to from outside the elevator and a display tells you which elevator to get on for your floor. At first I was put off by this arrangement, but over the course of our stay it seemed like this system really reduced elevator traffic and wait times.

And was kinda nervous hoping the hotel was not as bad as people on here writing. The hotel is in a great location right across from the beach. The hotel it's self needs some tender care and love. They have tried to ""refresh"" the rooms but in my opinion did not do a great job. Paint was un even the a/c vent was black from the dust inside what it seemed. The balcony sliding door was very flimsy and had rust on them. The bathroom is where I think the refresh should of happened. Very outdated. Other than all that. We had an okay stay clean room and comfy. Friendly staff and the little breakfast was nice. I would probably pay a little more next time and stay elsewhere like outrigger or the mariot.",,Zhdanyuk,2,3.0

We had an oceanview room of Wakiki Beach with a small balcony. The room was fine for the two of us but I think it would be crowded if you have children with you. They did provide a free continental breakfast which consisted of sweet rolls, fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, breads, coffee, & juices. I think some kind of soup. They are limited on space, so they give you an insulated small cooler to put your food in, in case you want to take it back to your room or the beach. This was located by the pool so seating was kind of difficult. They provided towels & chairs for the beach. The in room coffee pots were weird. On the internet, they provided keurig coffeepots and they did deliver one to our room when asked. They only provide 4 free pods, and any more are $2.00 each and we stayed 4 nights. That was pretty cheap but otherwise I have no complaints. The location is great at the end of Wakiki Beach.

Perfect as we have a toddler and are stuck in the hotel room after 7pm. - Tiki's, the attached restaurant, went almost every night! - the shuttle to Ala Moana Shopping Centre, stops right outside the hotel, it's so convenient and only $2 each to ride- right on the beach - Tucker & Bevy and Lulu's right around the cornerAfter leaving Aston Waikiki we went to Aulani, the Disney resort - much much nicer and much much more pricey. My main gripe with Aston Waikiki was the average breakfast fare with no free seating around the pool (nightmare with a toddler) and the room decor was very tired.

When we checked in at 4pm, we found we had a beach view, albeit not a perfect one due to the angle of the building. Still, it was nice to look out from the bed across to the beach. We were on the fifth floor, so in terms of noise it wasn't ideal as the partying on the pool level is right below you. I'd ask for a higher up room next time. The breakfast buffet is casual but comprehensive, and the best but is they provide cooler bags so you can take your breakfast down to the beach (or in our case, to our balcony).

If you rent a car, parking per day at the hotel is $27.00. There is no street parking so you'll have to suck it up & pay it.

Trollies are $2.00 per person & The Bus is $2.50 for a two hour pass.The hotel restaurant is called Tiki's & overlooks the beach. Food is very good, but I don't recommend the bar section as service is very slow & only offers a limited menu. The inside is a full service restaurant with faster service & excellent meal options. Downstairs at street level, there is a Wolfgang Puck's Express which has very good food. Ice cream, Subway & a cookie store are also in the hotel main floor.

She is an old bird, but that really only shows in the rooms, as updating should have been done 10 years ago. Frankly if they renovated the bathrooms in the rooms, I would have nothing to criticize. This is where the age of the hotel really shows.My pet peeves about this hotel is that they do not have a central laundry service, only dry cleaning.

It cost $46.00 to do 20lbs, taxes included. Also, if you are a smoker, expect to stand out on the street corner & bugged constantly by those looking to bum a smoke from you. I think I gave away more cigarettes than I smoked, & frankly felt a little unsafe there especially in the evenings. This hotel could easily place a bench & ashtray in the entrance of the parking area 40 feet from any business activity to accommodate their smoking guests & offer them a little security from the street.

We had spent our money in mom and pop bed and breakfasts, expansive and luxurious resorts and then.... the Aston. We checked in after realizing there were no other parking options except for paying $27. The young woman who checked us in was pleasant enough, but did not really go above and beyond for us. She did mention, however, 'Oh....you booked through priceline.' We were given keys to room 601 and went right to the room immediately. As we crossed the threshold, the strong scent of mildew permeated through the whole hotel room, not just the bathroom - where it was so strong you couldn't walk in. There were stains all over the credenza and table and chairs, and the barely there balcony looked out over the ghetto buildings behind the hotel.It just was not an acceptable room for us being that it was a romantic vacation and had come at the worst part - the end. I immediately called the house supervisor, Geri, who was very pleasant and said she would do what she could to get me into a different room. She personally walked us up to room 1926, an upgrade, and told us she just started recently as general manager and, unfortunately, not all rooms get the attention to detail they should. You could tell she was trying to do the right thing. Our new room was slightly bigger, did not have as much of a moldy stench as 601 (but it was there, do not be confused) but the bathroom was severely old and had mold all around it. Housekeeping never replenished new coffee or glasses (despite my written request with tip for them to do so.) The room had a view of waikiki but there was no way two people could sit on it and enjoy the view comfortably- partly because it is on the 19th floor and the bigger reason is the balcony is just too damn small. My rental car even came back from Valet with a dent and scratch in the driver side door.Really disappointed. Pool water was cool, too crowded to take advantage of the Breakfast on the Beach (ran out of food)..... so probably wouldn't go back.

We had a partial ocean view on the 14th floor with a King Bed. The view was unobstructed to the left, which was great! The balcony a little small for two people to sit on one chair and relax, but we made do. Had a great encounter with a member of the cleaning team, which resulted in having a very clean room and additional hand lotion / toilet paper / towels - as we requested. Thank-fully how we booked via the website had the amenity fee already included within the quote - which was nice to know what we were quoted on the website was included in the full fee.Here was a brief pro/con list from our visit:Pro's:- Great location- BYOB bag to pack snacks for a Breakfast on the beach- Nice ambiance with musician and dancer playing while breakfast is served/good music in the evening playing from the Tiki Bar- Paid option for paid for Valet service.Con's: - The hotel needs a facelift (holes in the wall, water damage on the ceiling, shower draining problems, paint faded, cracks in cement outdoor corridor)- Customer service was a bit of a con when dealing with a concern we brought up during our stay in regards to our key card/door lock not working / location of our room and having an ice machine right across from our door... literally 2 and a half feet away. (it was a little annoying trying to sleep as it would generate ice / guests needing ice at 3 am?...)- The hotel requires some new sound proofing for outside noise (dumpster, walking traffic, ice machine and other hotel guests)- Not a ton of variety for the Breakfast options for Gluten-free (fruit only), tons of cake and muffins though (so ok if you have kids) If you're looking for a budget-friendly hotel on Waikiki Beach, the Aston Waikiki Beach is probably a really good option. The pool / breakfast area would be great for people with kids. However, we found ourselves wanting to leave Waikiki for the slower more local experience of the North Shore, and other parts of the island. Reality is, who travels to somewhere like Hawaii and stays in the Hotel the ENTIRE time??... all in all - I would rate our experience as Average.

Tons going on along the main street along the beach in Waikiki. Choose Honolulu knowing it is a city with noise and homeless people but lots of people and things to do. Hotel pool has no sun until the afternoon, but the beach is so close.... Breakfast is by the pool each morning, no charge with lots of standard carbs and fruit. Omletes ($7), waffles for an extra charge made on the spot. They give you a clever little six pack type cooler to fill up to eat in your room or on the beach since seating is scarce by the pool.

The location of this hotel makes up for average quality of the rooms. My room was clean, although stuffy untill I open the patio door. This hotel is located as close to the beach as is physically possible without being a resort on the beach. Our room was just over $100 a night as we upgraded to an ocean view room with a balcony. It was arguably the best view I have ever had in a hotel and was worth the $20 increase in price. The room itself was average if not below. The beds are Asian style which means they are stiff in nature. At first I was impressed as it looked as if the room and bathroom had been modernized, especially the bathroom with artificially stressed furniture. It was only after closer inspection that I realized it was old distressed furniture. The big giveaway was the rusted hinges on the bathroom door. This room was also very small. There was no desk and the chair had to double as a stand for my suitcase. The room itself is done in the Asian motif and has tiled floors. I am glad I brought slippers. There is no microwave but does have a fridge. Wifi is extra unless you are in the cramped lobby. The fitness room is an extra $15, (in this day and age who charges for wifi and fitness rooms). It has old school air conditioning that was noisy. It is located on the main drag so traffic is loud, however you can walk everywhere at anytime of the day and night.All the being said the front desk staff was awesome and the view was killer. Free newspapers are always a nice treat. In the middle of the night I turned off the air conditioner and listened to the surf. It was awesome. Only the birds in the tree across the road o the beach broke the tranquility. The view itself was worth the money. On an overcast rainy day I sat, drank wine and watched the beach and surfers, it was awesome. I had a great stay in an average room because of the location. My money was well spent.From the airport take the shuttle, return for two people is about $55. If you have more than two take a cab. Ask for a room on floor nine or above because there is a huge tree in front of the hotel and you will not have a view unless you are above the tree. Rooms at the back with a balcony face another hotel’s back wall so be aware. You are not allowed to smoke on the property but sometimes people will smoke on their balcony…..bad people.

So well equipped.ANNOYINGLY, we had to pay an extra $18 ""amenity"" fee for wifi, dvd rental and continental breakfast, which was set out around the pool and for which we needed (supplied) cool bags. Seating was limited & uncomfortable. Car parking was an amazing $27 per day.Why can't these Hawaiian hotels just charge a rate for a room which includes everything?","London, United Kingdom","alancmoss</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",65,3.0

Once at the counter, we had our id's/receipt in hand when it was our turn to check in. We pre-paid for a standard room with a king-sized bed. I asked the woman if our room was considered ocean view, to which she smiled and said, ""Actually you've been upgraded to a partial ocean view!"" We said thank you and were given a key and headed to the our room on the 8th floor. When we entered the room, it was nothing like the rooms advertised on the website, was entirely outdated and out the window was literally NO VIEW of the ocean. All we could see was the back of another building, a big dumpster and no view of anything remotely nice and there were two double beds. I was shocked they can call it a partial-ocean view. While we already waited to check in, I now had to go downstairs and get back in the long line, to wait to speak with any desk staff to try and get a room with one bed as was promised and written on the receipt. A nice young man at the desk was much more helpful. He listened to my reasons for being upset with the room and explained the following: a ""standard"" room really means any room from the 5-8th floor that does not have any remodeling, which is only on upstairs floors; he changed our room to a true partial-ocean view on the 5th floor right in-between the restaurant and the pool. It was a beautiful view of the part of the ocean we could see and was much better than the first room. Credit should be given to the cleaning staff as the room was very clean, and would look kind of icky no matter what because of it's age. Housekeeping was excellent and there were many painter's working throughout the day on other rooms on the floor. They tell you that you get 3 free Keurig K-cups with your room, but they don't give you the K-cups, just the machine. You get your little breakfast tote and breakfast between 0630 and 0900. If you get there too early, you will likely get the left over fruit from the day before and the fruit is mostly the same daily. You get yogurt, pre-packaged dry cereal if left, thankfully there's oatmeal, extremely greasy and cheap muffins/doughnuts and pastries daily and literally plain, wheat or purple sweet potato dinner buns. Yes, cheap dinner buns. There is a juice machine, good coffee-but always empty and people are searching for a somewhat-full pot, and miso (tofu) hot soup as an Asian breakfast staple a few times during the week. You pay extra if you want an omelet or a waffle. There is a solo musician who plays his guitar every morning during the breakfast hours while a young lady dances as he plays. The dancer would teach young children to dance and they looked like they love it. This was enjoyable, but extremely loud as the speakers were very near our room. It was enjoyable the first two days until we realized the exact same songs were played for all 8 breakfasts. The Tiki restaurant had great food (a little spendy-but normal for the Waikiki area), great staff and great managers that we met. The down side is that if your hotel room is on the restaurant side of the hotel, the music is so loud, it is loudly heard until late at night every night. Our room had a locked adjoining room which was very thin-walled and could hear regular talking voices next door. The two men that were assigned to the hotel towel and beach chair station were very kind and professional. The problem with the beach chairs is that they were all out by 10:00 a.m. most days - which obviously isn't the fault of the employees. The workout facility is small but has nice, working and clean equipment and clean towels. Check out was easy, but be ready for the additional daily fee that is almost equivalent to paying an additional night's stay. I wouldn't recommend this hotel other than the location of this hotel is great if your goal is to sit on the sands of Waikiki Beach most of the time. Wolfgang Puck's was very good and reasonably priced and there are many convenience stores nearby.","Saint Paul, Minnesota","KPV8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Paul, Minnesota</strong>",10,2.0

The Wolfgang Puck restaurant down on the ground level had awesome food, huge portions and was definitely the best bang for your buck.

We complained and was told they would get back to us that evening which they didnt,so i went down in the morning and eventually got a room on the other side although we had to wait untill the afternoon.On the plus side we had free breakfast in the morning free wi fi in the room and free dvd and game rental also there is ps3 in the room which is great for the kids .All of which does,nt come with the Hilton or the Marriott which are just across the road and more expensive. They where redecorating when we where there but it did,nt impact on the stay at all.Its just one of those things that has to done.Parking is expensive but all valet parking in waikiki is. A little tip drop your cases off and head down the block just to the left of you at the end is the Waikiki Banyan they offer parking for $80 a week or $15 a day much cheaper.Breakfast was great a very nice cold selection and much as you want with live music and Hawaii dancing every morning. Tikkis bar and grill was great look out for Mike with the pony tail he was a fantastic waiter. live music every night there is a full restuarant and a bar .Didnt eat in the restuarant side it seemed a little expensive to me. We stayed in the bar and the food was fantastic.Try the lettuce wraps most meals where around $12. All in all a great place to stay.We did complain to the manager about the service at the beginning of the holiday and was told they would give us special rate the next time we stayed but we could have done without all the hasle after nearly 24 hrs on a plain.","Cardiff, United Kingdom","hil9279</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cardiff, United Kingdom</strong>",33,4.0

During our three night stay, the weather was fantastic, so we were able to really enjoy the full ocean view from the balcony of our 15th floor room. The location of this hotel is first class: right across the road from Waikiki Beach and within a short stroll of Waikiki shops, restaurants, cafes and bars.The room itself was cosy but clean, and tastefully redecorated. The bathroom was a little dated but immaculately clean. Service at the front desk was great. When we arrived, we were informed that we couldn't have the king bed we requested but instead they offered us two queen beds and a full ocean view instead of the partial ocean view we had booked. A fair deal. The breakfast offered a great assortment of fruit, yoghurt, juice, coffee and baked goods.I took advantage of the fitness centre and was very pleased to note that although small, it contained modern equipment and the air conditioning was set at an appropriate temperature. Finally, a few words about Tiki's Bar, which is probably the best hotel bar I have ever encountered. What a great spot. My friends and I took full advantage of the sweeping patio taking in great views of the beach and surrounding area alongside the daily drink specials. The food was fantastic, as well. Alongside Duke's, it would have to rate as one of the best watering holes in the area.The only facto preventing a five star rating for me is the price, which reflects the location and the price of other hotels in the area. It's not inexpensive, and for value for money rates 4/5 stars. I'd stay there again.","Toronto, Canada","jdogscoop</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",3,4.0

A previous reviewer put it well--the room is large enough, but there is nothing to make you comfortable in the room. Shallow drawers, no chair or sofa, no drawers in the nightstand, bizarre hanging beads serving as closet doors. The bathroom is terribly inconvenient. A previous reviewer said there wasn't enough shelf space--our bathroom had zero shelf space. You had to keep your toiletries in the other room. Why not put some kind of shelf in there? They even put the hairdryer in the closet because there is no place for it in the bathroom.We had booked in October and the resort fee was only $18 then, so that is what we paid, but it is now $23 per day.

We found a reasonable (for Waikiki) rate at the Aston and decided to stay for five nights. The good.....I liked the location of the property. It is directly across the street from a mellow beach with a protected swimming area. Great for small children or early morning lap swimmers. This hotel is at the end of the madness on Kalakaua Ave. (main beachfront street in Waikiki) I liked taking my morning run past the park, towards Diamond Head without having having to weave through crowds of people. The not so good.....Very unimpressed with the condition of the room. Stains on the ceilings, spots on the walls, beat up tiles and doors in the bathroom, and old fixtures did not lend itself to feeling as if the room was clean. The mildew smell in the bathroom from the lack ventilation was very unappealing. The pillows were flat. I could live with a small room if the space was utilized better however I found the bathroom did not have adequate counter space. The room itself was NOISY! We were on the 19th floor, facing the ocean. Every morning, on top of the street noise there was a man crooning Hawaiian tunes and a crowd of people clapping away. Forget sleeping past 7:30. At night you could hear people whooping it up at the bar. Sorry if I sound grumpy but I haven't slept well in five days.The continental breakfast was average but swarms of pushy people was a turn off. You can pay too much for cooked eggs if you so desire. The take away cooler was nice but we didn't use it for breakfast on the beach. There is a Starbucks around the corner if you prefer better coffee and oatmeal or an egg sandwich. Just past Starbucks is another little place that makes wraps and other healthier options. Overall, I would not choose to stay here again. I really liked being on the end of Waikiki so I would stay in the neighborhood. We are longtime Hyatt and Marriott patrons. The Hyatt Place is one block away and Marriott next door. I would have much preferred one of those properties if we were not traveling on a work budget.","sacramento, ca","TravelBug075</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>sacramento, ca</strong>",5,2.0

While the location and views were outstanding, the hotel rates just average on everything else.Check-in went smoothly. While the service was not bad, it definitely felt like this place does a TON of business and we were just another reservation. I had done a lot of research and was expecting the extra resort fee and advanced elevator system, so no surprises there. I had reserved an oceanfront room and requested a king bed in a quiet location. We were given a corner room on the 8th floor, with a view from Diamond Head to the other end of Waikiki Beach. It was fabulous.What was not fabulous was the room itself. It was not small, but definitely lacked creature comforts. The only place to sit was on the bed itself or two little barstools. There was no chair, no recliner, no couch, but room for any of them. For an oceanfront room, I also felt the lanai was very small. There was only one chair and footstool provided. The first day in the room I ended up taking a beach chair (your typical camping-style chair) and putting it on the lanai. The other days we moved the bar stools out and sat on them. We rented the oceanfront room because we're not really water-people, but wanted to enjoy the beach. There was a noisy refrigerator and a dresser with four small drawers. A safe was located in the closet. There was no coffee maker, no laundry bags, no folder outlining the services at the hotel (like TV channels, etc.) or transportation options. It almost felt as if they were forcing us to go outside and spend money. Luckily, there was not much noise from the neighbors, but the street outside the room was very noisy, as was the constant group of homeless people loitering on the street in front. (At least they were good entertainment!) The paint was chipping in places and the bathroom was very dated, but we expected an older hotel so weren't bothered by it. Housekeeping was okay. We found quite a bit of dust and lots of handprints on the sliding door. Another oddity was that the sliding door did not open completely--only about halfway due to a stopper. We weren't sure if it was a safety issue, but it was definitely annoying.We never used the pool, but didn't really see the need. There were a lot of rules--no water toys, no splashing, no jumping, no yelling. I get it, especially since the check-in desk was right next to the pool and the kids' beach just across the street. But, it simply looked like a gigantic soaking pool--quite boring. During our 4-day stay, I saw maybe a handful of people actually using it.Breakfast was adequate. We enjoyed the fruit, yogurt, and local-made Hawaiian donuts. The pastries were definitely stale the first day we tried it, so I'm not sure what their delivery schedule was. The donuts always seemed fresh, though. Never tried the pancakes or omelets because we didn't want to pay extra. We did bring our own travel mugs for coffee--the cups they provided were itty-bitty. I'm an early-riser when I'm on vacation, so made it down while things were relatively quiet. However, at about 8:30am, the area was pretty frenetic.Location was great. It was within walking distance of all major Waikiki attractions. We walked to Ala Moana Center one day--about 2.5 miles, but an easy stroll with lots of fun people to watch. The Honolulu Zoo was right next door. There are quite a few restaurants within a few blocks. (Tiki's and Lulu's were alright--their premium prices are likely for the location and popularity with locals.) Luxury row was just a few blocks down. Note that Honolulu is currently having issues with the scores of homeless people sleeping on the streets. The corner of Kalakaua and Kapahulu is a gathering place for the vagrants. While I can't fault the hotel or restaurants for this, the aggressiveness and drunkenness of these people made us feel very uncomfortable. I found myself avoiding the businesses located on that corner--which is bad! Tucker and Bevvy's had great healthy options! Also note that many transportation options stop at this hotel, including the Hilo Hattie's shuttle (free wheels to Ala Moana!), Japanese tour companies, and city bus.All in all, it was not our favorite spot to stay in Honolulu, but can see how it may be more popular with families, young, single travelers, or foreign visitors. We prefer the quieter, opposite end of Waikiki.","Anchorage, Alaska","tgsapo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anchorage, Alaska</strong>",59,3.0

We arrived late at night and had no problem with check-in. We left early morning and had no problems with check-outWe booked through Travelocity and were aware of the amenity fee of 18$ before we booked. We did notice that the fee had increased after we booked but we were still honored the original fee price. The hotel is located on the East end of Waikiki Beach, very close to the zoo(across the street) and also directly across the street from the lagoon (walled off) portion of the beach, which is much nicer for our small kids to swim. We did not rent a car for this trip. There are trolley and city bus stops right outside or within a block of the hotel that can take you everywhere. We prebooked a taxi to take us to and from the airport for a flat rate fee of 29 each way. We stayed in a deluxe ocean view room #1823. The view from our balcony had some of everything. We could see the ocean, beach, city, and even glimpses of the mountains between hotels to the north. We were very happy with the view. The balcony is not huge, and only had one lounge chair to sit in. The rooms themselves are not very big but when we go on vacation we are not there to spend time in the rooms! We all found the beds to be really comfortable. Even my daughter slept thru the night which she never does at home! Our room did not have a coffee maker which was fine as Starbucks is just a few steps from the hotel. There was a little table with 2 barstool style chairs. Also a nice sized TV for the room and a playstation 3. There was a dresser which was big enough to fit my clothes, as well as both my kids clothes, but not my wife's, so she was the parent who lived out of a suitcase for this trip. There is also a closet and in-room safe. One downside to the room was that some of the outlets did not work, but we just took turns charging our devices. There was a small fridge in our room that was perfect for holding any breakfast items that we wanted to save for a snack. There was also 4 drinking glasses that were changed as we used them by the cleaning staff. The bathroom was not huge but served its purpose. Tub/shower combo and the water pressure was absolutely awesome! I miss it! There was lots of hot water. One thing about the hot showers was the steam would make everything in the bathroom damp, and the fan was or did not seem to be existent or working very well in there. Our room was cleaned daily by very friendly room staff. We would come back from our daily adventures to nicely made beds. Our towels were changed daily even if we hung them up( a card asked us to hang them up to save them so as to conserve energy). Fine by us, but what's the point of the card? Our bathroom soaps, shampoo etc were restocked as we used them up, which was nice. We did bring our own just in case. The breakfasts included daily with your amenity fee were decent. There was muffins, danishes, pastries, cookies, fruit salad, juice, pop(for breakfast!) and coffee and tea. Also included which we ate a lot of was yoghurt of different varieties, some were not sealed properly when I opened them and had to be tossed, which was too bad. Everyday there was also a different Asian type of breakfast, either noodles or rice balls with a side of either kimchee(yummy) beans, or greens. I think our favorite breakfast item was the malasadas. 3-4 different varieties that were actually pretty good. We started calling my son Mr Malasada because he ate so many. We were given one bag to fill up with breakfast items. Seeing as we had 4 in our group this didn't seem enough. We just had to ask the breakfast supervisor at entry to the station and we were given an extra bag, no hassle. Instead of jockeying for a limited table we just ate up in our room. A note, breakfast opens at 630AM. If you want to be one of the first thri the line you should get there at least 10 mins early. The line got long otherwise but did move quickly. Items (especially the malasadas!) were restocked pretty quick which was nice. The elevators were NOT a problem at all. Pass your room key in front of the sensor. Type in your floor. Done. I think the longest we waited for one of the 5 elevators was 30 seconds. The DVD rentals included in the amenity few were a nice touch. However, a lot of the discs are scratched up and the movies would skip on the Playstation 3 BlueRay player. Other times the movies would not even work, such as The Hobbit. I think thought this was due to the movie being a DVD and not a BlueRay but other DVDs worked fine. The game rentals only worked if it was a PS3 game. If all the rentals were PS3 or BlueRays this problem could be averted in the future. Wifi (also included in the fee) worked well as long as you were in your room. If you went onto your balcony it stopped working. There was wifi available in the lobby area but I never used it. The pool was located next to the lobby. It is in a shady part of the hotel during the morning and early afternoon. The sun shines after that. The water is cool which is nice during the sunny afternoon but not so nice before that! You can borrow beach towels and beach chairs (number of chairs is limited) which is included in the amenity fee. All in all I was extremely happy with my families stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel. We all agreed it was a great location and the room was perfect for our needs. Should we make our way to Waikiki again we would definitely consider this Hotel.","Sidney, Canada","kabukibird</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sidney, Canada</strong>",4,4.0

Everywhere in Hawaii you see great concern for the environment. Not at the Aston! The ""breakfast"" is served in numerous small styrofoam containers that will stay around long after we are gone.The rooms are dated but ok. The front desk staff was not very friendly. The room safe did not work and the air conditioning could be turned on or off. I couldn't control the temperature or fan. The ice machine outside the room added excitement to the noises of the night. The two good things are the location right on Waikiki Beach and the cleaning staff that were very friendly and did a great job. If you decide to book the Aston Waikiki Beach because of the price, make sure to come with no expectations! And oh yes, add $18 to the price you thought you were going to pay.","Tel Aviv, Israel","Gabriel L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tel Aviv, Israel</strong>",9,2.0

Here's our thoughts on the hotel and the area:LOCATION:The hotel is nicely situated toward the end of the Waikiki resort corridor. It's right next to the zoo and within a long walk to Diamond Head. We liked that it was directly across from the beach with only a short walk across the street to get there. You can check out towels and folding chairs to take to the beach at the hotel pool. FOOD:The breakfast is better than most hotel free breakfasts. It's just the basics - cereal, fruit, coffee, juice, yogurt and some very good doughnuts and pastries. There is also some Asian fare for those who want something different. They also make fresh omelets and french toast for $7.00 and $5.00. We never had the french toast but the omelets were great and the large enough for my wife and I to split. It came with toast too. It thought it was a bargain considering the area. They give you a small cooler bag to take your breakfast to go.The food at the Tiki's was very good as well. Be sure to go to happy hour. They have a good selection of well drinks and beers for $3.00! Again, a bargain for Waikiki!We also ate at the Wolfgang Puck Express on the ground floor. Also very good with restaurant quality food and big portions.There are lots of other choices within walking distance. We ate at the Farmer's Market at King's Village. It is on Mon. Wed. Fri. & Sat.ROOM:It's an older hotel that had a remodel some time ago. It's a basic hotel room. It is not the Four Seasons but for the price point it was fine. Clean, good towels, good water pressure, lots of hot water and a beautiful view. Didn't need much more!! Hint: There's a small table and stools in the room. They just fit through the sliding door for meals on the balcony overlooking the ocean!STAFF:We had an issue with our reservation upon arrival. They said the company we had booked with had booked two rooms instead of one. We were initially told we would have to resolve the problem ourselves or we could be double charged. It's not really what I wanted to here at the beginning of our vacation. However, the supervisor Nicole took the reigns and got it straightened out within an hour. Also, the first room we were assigned was too cold and the thermostat wouldn't work. We let Nicole know while she was solving our first problem and she quickly moved us to another room. Kudos to Nicole for stepping up and making sure we were happy! The rest of the staff was always friendly, helpful and smiling.Not sure where all of the unsatisfactory reviews are coming from. The hotel met or exceeded our every expectation for a hotel in a reasonable price range. We would definitely recommend and stay there again!","Lincoln, Nebraska","MMSJLV</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lincoln, Nebraska</strong>",81,4.0

You get on crack at breakfast and if two people occupy the room, then both must appear at the same time. This hotel should be renamed, Nickel and Dime Hotel, because that's what they tried to do to us. There are so many other hotels on Waikiki that if you choose this hotel then I would have to assume that you do not know the difference between getting services that you paid for and lousy service.

Miso soup was part of the complimentary offerings, but the only other hot offering (cooked to order omlet) carried a $7 charge. I thought having live music and hula dancing during the early morning was going to be hokey and annoying, but the guitarist/vocalist and his dancing wife were very good. They added a soothing presence to the bustling, jostling breakfast scene.","Voorheesville, New York","Alan K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Voorheesville, New York</strong>",37,4.0

The staff was very professional and courteous. There was not a time that I was in need of anything. They are attached to Tiki's Bar & Grill that has some of the best food I have ever eaten and a life band most evenings. Each day at breakfast the hotel had a Hawaiian singer and Hula dancer; which made each day have a great start.

You are given a card which you use for your room and also to use the elevator. Although my room did not look like the rooms on the website, it was pleasant and clean and everything was in good working order. I stayed in an ocean deluxe room on floor 19 and I was very happy with the view; beautiful, overlooking the ocean with a balcony and chair so I could sit out. Breakfast was good; a selection of food and you are supplied with a bag so you can take your breakfast and eat it elsewhere if you do not want to sit by the pool. Every day there was a singer at breakfast time which is lovely to hear while having your breakfast and creates a lovely relaxing atmosphere.The location is good; directly opposite the beach and if you walk 10 minutes up the road you will find a good selection of well known shops and shopping malls/markets. Closer by the hotel is a selection of smaller shops and restaurants. You can also dine at Tiki's Grill within the hotel which is great. There are quite a few homeless people near the hotel but this wasn't a problem. Most of the people I met in Honolulu were friendly and I felt quite safe walking around even on the evening. Waikiki itself is quite busy and the road the hotel is situated on is always busy but I found there to be no problem with the noise level and with the balcony door closed I could hardly hear any sound at all from outside.Amenities also included unlimited DVD's where I was given a swipe card and you can use this at the machines near the front desk to choose your DVD'S however I think some improvements could be made on the DVD options.Overall I am very happy I decided to stay here and would recommend this hotel to anyone. If you are looking for a lovely hotel which is clean, safe and has friendly and helpful staff, located near the beach with beautiful views then this is the hotel for you.

The twin room was a bit compact, the suite was very spacious and the king was somewhere in-between! The ocean could be seen from all rooms and the suite had an amazing view across Waikiki beach. The only thing missing in the rooms was a kettle.There were mixed opinions about the 'breakfast on the beach' concept - I quite liked it as it meant I had snacks to munch on all morning, but others would have preferred a more traditional sit-down hot/cold buffet breakfast. It also finishes way too early so there's no chance of a lie-in!The mandatory amenity fee is annoying (although I realise this applies to a lot of Waikiki hotels) - I'd prefer the room rate to be a bit higher and have it all included, or only have to pay for the things you actually want to use. Having said that you do get quite a lot - breakfast, wifi, gym, DVDs and games, safe, newspaper and free local calls.All the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful and they got me checked-in before 11am as I arrived early from an overnight flight. The tour desk was also good and found us an awesome 'open-door' helicopter flight around the island.The pool area is a bit uninspiring - too much concrete and not enough greenery, but we really enjoyed the relaxing afternoon happy hour cocktails in Tiki's bar and also ate there a few times - excellent food and service.Location is perfect - right across the road from the beach and plenty of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.Some friends stayed at the Hilton previously but said the value for money is better at the Aston.

Years of wear and tear were very clear. It didn't feel ""unclean"" per say but needed a fresh coat of paint and a new mattress badly. Pros: The breakfast and movies that fall under the amenity fee were very nice. We enjoyed picking out our food nice and early for the best selection and taking it up to our room and packing the cooler they provide for later on (By early I mean 7am at the latest!).Cons: It seems they spent more on the elevator system than anything else. Too complicated and wasted too much time. This is a very busy hotel. Our first and only experience in Waikiki so I don't know if its the case everywhere but relaxing is not the atmosphere you get. Luckily we only needed a place to lay our heads down before moving on. Do not pay for valet ($27 a day!).

We had a exterior hallway from the elevator to the room that overlooked what looked like a small apartment building, it was not the beautiful beach, but it wasn't disgusting.

I do have to say the air conditioner, didn't work well when you came in hot and sweaty and stayed that way. They sent a service man in and said it was fine, but it only cooled down during the night. I asked at the desk in the morning, and they offered another room, but not a king bed and it would be on the other side of the building.

Unfortunately, we were there when the jellyfish invaded the water, but that's nobody's fault, we'll just have to plan a bit more around the full moon next time. The breakfast was easy to get through with plenty of variety if you like pastries and fruit. We loaded up our cooler every morning, ate in our room and it was more than enough for all of us to last until our normally very early lunch. The valet parking was $27/day (ouch) but as there really weren't other options and I didn't want to risk the rental being damaged if we parked down at the zoo. Plus, with the unpredictable rain, we would've been soaked at least once getting to the car. The valet was quick and courteous. When we'd call ahead from our room, the car was already there by the time we got downstairs.It also had very easy access to H-1 for when we went to Diamond Head and Koko Head craters. Two turns, 7 or 8 blocks down and you were to the highway.The elevators were very efficient. Scan your card, hit your floor # and it tells you which lettered elevator to get in. You often went direct to your floor, but at most only 1-2 other stops first. I love that system.

My only other suggestion would be for the hotel to install a laundry. As this is a family orientated hotel, with most guests staying a few nights,this can become a nightmare.

The highlight of this hotel for me is definitely the breakfast buffet! In every room, there is a small cooler you can bring with you, and at the buffet, you can fill it up with juice, yogurt, cereal, pastries...all of the breakfast items they offer, which is great! Then, you can either spread out on the chairs by the pool and enjoy the daily singer and hula dancer, or take everything back to your room (hey, if that's what you like!), but my friends and I would check out some beach towels and chairs and walk across the street to picnic on the beach!

The air con didn't work, but you know what, we didn't need it - a lovely ocean breeze coming in the window was enough! The breakfasts had a lot of pastries, but also had a wonderful fresh fruit salad every day which was just divine! As well as wonderful entertainment every morning.

We were away from the middle of the hustle and bustle of Kalakaua Ave on the edge of it, right next to the zoo! The staff were all lovely and helpful, and the tour desk staff were so friendly.

The hotel security was very nice in the way they handled the situation and cops were called, etc. As I was traveling on my own with my son, this attention was appreciated and needed.We especially appreciated Vivinne's attentiveness. Such things can and do happen in hotels. In this case, my beach bag (containing shorts, sun screen and my room key) was stolen from the beach. So there was no mystery as to how someone got the key. I went directly to the hotel to report this and also mentioned my concern about returning to my room knowing that my key had been taken. But the receptionist did not take my fears seriously and said there was no way anyone could find out which room we were in. Wrong.After the incident, we were moved to an ""upgraded"" room...which appeared to be just like the one we were in before with the exception that the tv didn't work (had to call maintenance) and the fact that BOTH beds had sheets with huge holes. GAH! On check out we were told that Nicole from the hotel would be calling to speak with me about the burglary incident. No call received. I ended up calling a month later, leaving a message, received a call back a week later, only to have Nicole inform me know that the hotel's insurance wouldn't cover my stolen property. Um, what stolen property.....I retrieved it myself supermom style. I explained that I simply wanted them to review their security policy, let the front desk know that guests concerns regarding security should be taken seriously, and that they needed to revisit their idea (which she repeated countess times) that there is no way a burglar can find their way to the correct room with the room key. Nicole said the hotel would be in touch. That was three months ago. Apparently these issues are not a great concern. Pity.Burglary and holes aside: Would I stay here again?

It's nothing flash--not particularly 'Hawaiian', not contemporary or glamorous or chic--but it's fine. It does the job its meant to do.The only issue I had was the shower. The shower head was so low that I had to bend over to wash my hair (I'm 5'7, hardly a giant), and there's no way of raising it. And as for the flow, you know that episode of Seinfeld where Kramer discovers they're putting low flow shower heads into the building, so he buys something that's used to clean elephants on the black market? I think Aston Waikiki Beach did the same thing. I was practically pinned against the opposite wall from the spray every morning. Try as I might, I couldn't fix that either. On the plus side, it sure does blast away all the errant grains of sand stuck on you from the beach.Overall, the hotel is totally fine for a few days while you explore the island. You're paying for the location, not the hotel. Keep that in mind. For the price you pay you'd normally expect a better hotel, but this is Waikiki. A three-star hotel for a 4-star and above price.","Lahaina, Hawaii","PollyPolly_123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lahaina, Hawaii</strong>",1,3.0

Honolulu hotels are very expensive. So to get on Waikiki on a budget, this maybe an answer, but don't expect much. I had read the reviews and was concerned going into this hotel, so I did not have high expectations. Think of an aging Motel Six, but a high-rise. Don't drag your bags up to the second floor unless you know you can check in as an early check in is unlikely. You may need to leave your bags with a porter that's on the 1st floor arrival area. Morning breakfast is a waste of time. Better breakfast options are nearby. Pool is tiny. In the shade until afternoon, smaller than most backyard pools and not deep. Its on the second floor. Ten man homeless troupe on the corner, creepy. Beach conveniently across the street, but other than the seawall protected area, it is not too good for casual swimming. Underwater rocks will bang up your feet or worse. Strong pull of the waves. Plenty of HPD walking the beach. Short walk to restaurants and luxury row of shops. Nice sunset views. Starbucks and Subway on the corner and close by. Room decor is quite dated, but reasonably clean. In room safe is handy. Room is very small, especially with four bags for a lengthy stay. One chair balcony and is very small. Bathroom pretty small and unvented, steams up easily. Beds soft and ok. Not likely to get an early check in as cleaning staff is short and slow. Late check out is about $20/two hours up to six hours ($75) IF you can get it, but bell hops will hold your bags if you have a late flight out. Maybe a 2.5 star hotel. Tip: Stay on another island like Maui and do a day trip in into Honolulu/Oahu for sightseeing. Did not care for the big city feel nor for the rude/entitled Asians that make up 80% of the tourists in Honolulu. Did not see much of this on Maui. Honolulu is not a relaxing place for a vacation. You can get by here, but would not want to stay more than two days.","Powell, Tennessee","Danny W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Powell, Tennessee</strong>",27,3.0

We then had to find our own way to reception which was on the first floor.No directions, no help from porters.Upon checking in we were told that check in is not until after 1.30 pm and that if we wanted to check in now we could upgrade our rooms for an extra $60 a night! we were here for two weeks so declined the offer. When asked what we were to do for 5 hours the receptionist just shrugged his shoulders.We asked a guest at the hotel what to do and she told us we can leave our bags downstairs with the bell hop if we wanted to have a walk around Waikiki. So we struggled down stairs with our bags again, once more no help from the Hotel.After a 9 hour flight and no sleep in 28 hours we were not impressed.When we finally got in our rooms we were even more disappointed. Small,dirty, the verandah was so small you could not put a chair on it. The bathroom was old looking with a bath tub and shower screen and a small dirty shower head.The silicone around the bath tub was missing and the water pressure was very weak.There were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room, i expect this from a 3 star room let alone a 4.5 star. The ceiling was stained the carpet thread bare in places.I asked for a kettle which was brought up an hour later but most mornings the cleaning staff removed it.The swimming pool area was a disappointment, the painted concrete around the pool was old and sections had been repaired but not painted.The toilet in the pool area was disgusting, ceiling panels falling down, urinals dirty and falling off the wall, tiles broken and smelled.The so called ""Breakfast on the Beach"" every morning that was advertised and was one of the deciding factors in us booking this Hotel was a joke!. You got a small cooler bag in your room and you were supposed to fill it with the continental break fast and take it across the street to the beach ha ha, most people sat around the pool on the few tables and chairs and sun beds, if none were left which was most of the time then you took it back to your room.On the positive the location of the hotel was not to bad. Its the last hotel on the strip and is next to the Zoo. Tikis bar and grill which is on the pool deck is very good and has live music most nights, the food is excellent as is the service. There is also a Pizza cafe on the ground floor as well as a Starbucks around the corner.All in all i would not recommend this hotel if you are expecting a 4.5 star rating. Expect a 2 or 3 star and you will not be disappointed.","Townsville, Australia","Dean J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Townsville, Australia</strong>",3,2.0

Never asked why we were in Hawaii or made us feel special. The pool was right next to check in so that was awkward. And the 'breakfast on the beach or poolside' was a tiny lunch bag to fill with donuts. After two coffees and two donuts the souvenir bag was full. When you have a family of four and only allowed one trip through the donuts line it just was not enough for a family. Waikiki just like California-shops are too expensive and very crowded. This is not the dream Hawaii you think of. Also note that there are a huge number of homeless people in Waikiki-they do not bother you but they are everywhere.

I've stayed at this property at least 5 tines in the past but this one was a bit more disappointing than the others. In fact each stay has been less memorable than the last. So this visit- upon check in, advised ""system was down"" so we needed to wait by the pool (which was cordoned off in a very tacky rope fencing until system was back up again. - upon check in I was made to sign a document stating that any smoking in the room or on the lanai (balcony) would result in a $275 cleaning fee. To our surprise the room already smelled like it had been smoked in for several months upon our opening the door. The cigarette smell was in the AC and was with us the entire time. Disappointing for a $300/nite room. - valet parking is$27 / day plus tips ! Why? How do you justify this charge Aston?! Ridiculous IMO - fees are confusing. Breakfast was covered in check in briefing as being included. But documents provided say its part of a $18 a night resort amenity fee. Is that fee per person? Need to clay spell out what is included and what is an additional charge.

GREAT location & amazing balcony views2. All the employees were so helpful and nice3. Free breakfast (although, it would be nice to have a little bit of variety every few days- but this is being nitpicky. lol)4. Free beach chairs (as long as you bring it back before 6pm)5. Kid friendly poolCONS:1. Rooms need some refurbishment, esp the bathrooms. Our toilet leaked whenever we would flush. The bathtubs were very slow to drain (important when you have little kids)2. Rooms were on the small side. Even with just two normal-sized suitcases and a fold-up umbrella stroller, we had no room to really walk around.3. Beach towels & beach chairs must be returned by 6pm; otherwise, you get charged a fee. I get that they need to take inventory, but sundown wasn't until past 7pm.

We stayed on the 24th floor - the 25th floor is the last floor. The elevator is interesting you swipe your card, type in your room number and it directs you to the elevator to hop in and it takes you directly there. One thing that I found a little disappointing was the breakfast. They do a wonderful job of offering a cooler and encouraging you to have breakfast on the beach - but they do this as the breakfast area has very limited seating. Also the breakfast is very unhealthy. You are only offered cereal, pastries, fruit and drinks (juice, tea, coffee etc.) and you have to put it in the cooler you are given in your room. There is no tray so if you decide to eat around the pool (with the limited seating); it's a balancing act. The added annoyance is that you are only allowed to go and get breakfast once. If you want to have anything more you are welcome to omlettes and french toast - but they are an extra $5 each. Overall expect to pay a lot in Hawaii - everything costs something.

I called to find out about a late check out to which the front desk person put me on hold for 5 minutes before rudely picking it up and saying ""I'm checking people in right now & don't have time to check. I'll call you back."" Then called me back 10 minutes later to tell me I'd have to ask again the day before I checked out or he morning of. The next day we had no hot water! My boyfriend called down, he was told by a woman she would check with maintenance and then call back and never did. I got up the next morning to take a shower and AGAIN no hot water. I called down the manager Nicole told me she would check with maintenance and call me back to which I informed her I expected a call back unlike yesterday when they didn't feel a need to return the call. Waited 30 minutes for her call back to be told I had to wait another 30-45 minutes for the boiler to turn on. But as an ""accommodation"" she would let me check out at 2pm for free. Sorry but that's not equivalent to the problem, but I told her I would accept that for a start. I went downstairs this morning to talk to a manager (I didn't know it was her the day before) and instead of getting me a manager he proceeds to spew out he can only do 2pm. I again repeated when does the manager arrive to which he told me 7am. I returned at 7:30 am to be told I already spoke with the manager yesterday. I politely told him I wanted to speak with her again and he told me well she's in at 8 am I'll have her call you. I'm in Hawaii, I'm not sitting around on my last day waiting for a call. So I informed him of that. So now I'm waiting for a cell phone call. I hope we can come to a better ""accommodation"" because it will truly define whether or not I return to this hotel. However, if you don't have issues the rooms are clean and the hotel is right across from the beach. We didn't like the breakfast, every time we ate it we seemed to be sick for the day. It's continental unless you want to pay $5 for an omelet, $3 for a waffle (plus tax of course because the tax you ridiculous here).

It has mixed reviews but our stay was great. The room was standard size and a great view of the ocean. The balcony size has been commented on previous reviews but was pretty standard for a hotel room for 2 to sit and watch the amazing sunsets. Staff were nice and welcoming. The room could definitely do with a coffee machine though. Breakfast was quirky down by the pool and a bit of a free for all but it was different!Tikis bar was great and staff really friendly, food was really nice with good cocktails. The pool is a little small and could do with some freshening up.I can imagine how busy that will get however with the beach directly across the road it's not too big a deal.

The staff arrange two rooms that located in different floor. Besides, both of these room have ice maker just right in front of our door. There were always have people take ice cubes during midnight. We asked them to change our room, they did changed, but their attitude is very bad. My father doubted that the staff have discrimination to the Asian people for arrange those bad rooms for us.Here are some reminders for the people who want to stay here: 1. They only provide the valet parking which charge $27. I suggest you can park in the zoo's parking lot. It also very close to this hotel, one hour only charge $1.2. You will be require to pay $ 18 per night/room for your breakfast and Wifi. They will provide a small bag for you to pick up your breakfast. If you want to eat at the poolside, that will be very hard to find a place to sit.Anyway, This hotel only worth for their good location. They provide the worst service that I never seen. We won't stay and recommend this hotel again.這次的家庭出遊，我負責訂房，8/21-8/24的兩間雙人房，結果櫃台故意安排不同樓層，且兩間都門一打開就看到製冰機的房間。到凌晨四點多都有房客拿冰塊，加上房間隔音又不好，一直聽到門外和隔壁的嬉鬧聲。家人也質疑是否該旅館歧視亞洲人？故意安排沒人要的房間給我們？總之，服務極差，只有地點好還算不錯。建議考慮本旅館的人：1.他們停車只提供代客泊車，要價一天27美金，不如考慮就停在附近的動物園停車場，一小時只要1美元，還可自由進出。2.很多旅客在訂房時沒注意，一個房間一晚還要額外收取設備服務費18美元，可以使用wifi和早餐。房間會提供一個小袋子讓你在泳池邊領取食物帶走。但如果要坐在泳池邊享用的話，可能很難搶到座位。","Taipei, Taipei, Taiwan","doris374</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Taipei, Taipei, Taiwan</strong>",8,1.0

On the last day when we were packing up we realised that during our 4 night stay, to which we only had our room serviced once, the following went missing. Iphone 5, my fiance's deodorant and my daughters body board which we had only just purchased at the beginning of the trip. Iphone 5, i only noticed on the last day was missing as it was my ""australian"" phone so wasn't using it, I had been using my ""US"" phone. The Iphone 5 eventually turned up between the mattresses of the king size bed. How it got there none of us can work out as my fiance and I both saw it in my handbag and neither of us would ""hide"" something between the mattress.As for the deodorant and the body board, they never turned up!!!If it wasn't for the missing items I would give the hotel a rating of average as it is in a great location, the breakfast each morning was good for a continental style breakfast. unfortunately due to the missing items I won't be going back nor will I recommend to friends.The other negative on the last day we needed to print out our boarding documents, there is no business centre or 'free' service. We were directed to a VERY expensive computer and printer where we had to pay for internet and the printer. It cost us $20 to print out 4 boarding passes.

The hotel is located right across the street from Waikiki Beach! We had a great view without having to spend a fortune.While the hotel was great, there were always long lines at the front desk. We probably waited thirty minutes to an hour just to check in. Another downside was the ""breakfast on the beach"". Sadly, they advertise that breakfast is on the beach, but it is actually served around their pool and they offer a cooler to take your breakfast over to the beach. Definitely a bummer when we found out about that. The breakfast was ridiculously crowded, especially for the small offering they had. On the bright side, we used the valet parking daily as it was so convenient and the valets were very friendly! The movie rental was also a bonus as we could stay in and watch a movie if we wanted for free.

I wanted a hotel where we could see the ocean from our room and easily get to the beach. This hotel is across the street from a beautiful beach park and very close to the zoo and aquarium. The staff were friendly, the rooms were nicely decorated and clean, the free breakfast was just enough (assorted cereals; yogurt with local flavors such as mango, papaya, and coconut; assorted pastries; fresh fruit salad, and coffee/tea/juice. You could also purchase omelets and waffles at a reasonable price. Seating around the pool was very limited but we didn't mind taking the food to our room. We also had a refrigerator and a coffee maker in the room. The coffee was perfectly fine for my husband but I was thrilled that there was a Starbucks next to the hotel on the street level. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was small but had everything we needed. The room was plenty of space for two people. We had two queen beds, a large dresser, a table and two chairs, a desk, and a soft chair. We really only used the room to sleep as we spent most of our time touring, walking along Kalakaua Avenue, or at the beach. Even though we didn't have a car except for one day, public transportation was very accessible. There were many island tours available for a fee and the trolley lines and the free shopping vans all stopped at the hotel. The elevators were amazingly efficient. By scanning your room card and entering your floor, you were directed to one of six elevators. You never had to wait more than a minute and you never stopped at more than two other floors. The International Market Place was only six blocks away with lots of shops and restaurants in between. Our favorite restaurant was the Chinese seafood restaurant in the lower level of the Hyatt Regency Waikiki. Not only was the food excellent but the early bird specials were very reasonably priced.

Upon arriving, check-in was friendly and swift - and our room was as we requested.This hotel is spotlessly clean - housekeeping do a fabulous job - in fact, all the staff do a fabulous job. Our room was on the 17th floor with a lovely view of the ocean. As mentioned in other reviews, this hotel is not ultra modern - but I liked the quirky charm of the traditional decor - and the room was spotless. The bathrooms are not modern - but as I didn't go to Hawaii to look at granite countertops in my hotel bathroom, this did not bother me in the slightest - the bathrooms are clean, well stocked, and the shower had good water pressure with plenty of hot water ( not that you really need it in Hawaii!)I thought that the $18 per day per room resort fee was well worth it - my 11 year old took full advantage of the Playstation 3 and free games when the sun got too much for him. We also watched several dvd movies when we returned to the room after dinner. Included in the resort fee is the DVD/games rentals / wifi / breakfast / in-room safe / towels for pool + beach.The breakfast is around the pool every morning - yes it can get a bit monotonous but it is perfectly adequate with variety and it is well stocked - we probably had the breakfast 3 times in the 7 days we were there.The pool area is lovely - spotless pool, plenty of sun beds and not too busy.Would I recommend this hotel - absolutely!

Arlyn saw to it that our billing was happily uneventful. :) We had some mixed feelings about the breakfast set-up, but, it grew on us, and compared to other available local options, it was really pretty innovative overall. They give you a cooler bag to keep that you fill every morning with an extended continental breakfast & some fancier prepared extras for a very low price. My husband had the great idea of actually bringing breakfast up to the balcony, so that was nice. The staff is very upbeat and ready to serve. The rooms are clean.

On a similar budget, we may go back to the same place and type of room.

The staff was incredibly courteous, the room was adorably decorated and though our view wasn't ""incredible"" we really didn't mind since we were rarely inside during the day (and if you're camped out in your hotel room while you're in Hawaii, you're doing Hawaii wrong!). The hotel is LITERALLY across the street from Waikiki Beach. There are so many places that are walking distance from the hotel (including a zoo!) and that was a big plus for us, it was fun to go exploring. The pool/bar area was fun, there was live music, delicious drinks and great food! There was a free breakfast buffet included which was your standard continental breakfast, nothing special. Though they do offer a ""Breakfast on the Beach"" service, which we sadly didn't take advantage of (we were too busy!). The only thing knocking this down from an excellent to a very good is the bathroom was a tad bit old and had a slightly mildewy smell, but honestly it was worth it.","Los Angeles, California, United States","LBShelby</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California, United States</strong>",5,4.0

After finalising and paying for the booking, I read several bad reviews and so was not sure what to expect. We arrived at noon and were advised that there was a room available straight away if we wanted to upgrade to an ocean front room (1731) which we did. The room had a panoramic view of Waikiki and was well worth the price for the upgrade. The continental breakfast was good and there was plenty of cereal, fruit, yoghurt, croissants, coffee, etc. There were also hot breakfast options for an additional price but we were quite happy with the healthy options available. We found this hotel was well located, had great dining options whatever your budget and the staff were efficient and friendly. We were more than happy with the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel and Its a property that we would have no problems in recommending. Luckily we didn't ready the ""bad""reviews until after we paid for the booking. Suffice to say that unfortuantely, certain people will always find something negative to say, even if they stay at a 5 star hotel with nothing to complain about.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","KC01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",33,5.0

We really like this hotel, and we feel very much at home here.When staying at a beach hotel, wherever it is, we feel that the three most important things are cleanliness, comfort, and convenience, and this hotel has all three! Our room was spotlessly clean, the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable, and there was great and responsive maid service as well as plenty of hot water in the shower! From room 1932, we had an incredible view of the ocean. The Aston Waikiki Beach hotel has a very nice pool and is located right across the street from the beach, and within walking distance from Honolulu Zoo, Waikiki Aquarium, and plenty of stores and restaurants. This is the perfect place to stay, especially for families and very active people.The section of the beach that is right across from the hotel has a wall in the water that makes that portion of the beach almost like a swimming pool. Walk several yards in either direction, and you are on a beach with waves and surfers and all kinds of lessons and rentals for watersports. You can buy a floaty and inflate it right downstairs in the convenience store (and you can refill it when it deflates). Probably any shuttle that you want to take to any activity that you want to do will pick you up at this hotel. You can arrange things on your own or at any of the activity desks downstairs. The continental breakfast is still a good deal, even with the new ""amenities fee"" that is charged separately from the room charge. And, really, what could be nicer than sitting by the pool, sipping delicious coffee, and listening to beautiful live music while watching a lovely hula dancer?There is valet parking at an additional charge, which we did not use this time. Instead, we rented a car for a day to drive around the island and up to the north shore. We have used the valet service in the past and found it to be excellent. The bell services are also wonderful--we checked out and left our suitcases there for the day, and then the bell captain arranged for a cab for us to return to the airport. We noticed that traffic was horrendous at any time of the day, so I would expect that the valet service would seem slow considering that the car has to be driven around to the waiting area--even a drive around the block would take quite awhile with that traffic!Waikiki was incredibly crowded, and there were long, long lines EVERYWHERE we went! So, we were not upset about the check-in line, which moved quickly, or the breakfast line. In fact, the only place we didn't see long lines was on the north shore.I personally was very happy about the fact that there was complimentary coffee in the evenings, right near the check-in desk. The coffee was so good, and really hit the spot at the end of a long and busy day. I have said this in previous reviews: if you are the kind of person who is looking for a stuffy and formal resort where you don't ever leave the property, where drinks are served to you at the pool, and where you would feel uncomfortable walking into the lobby in your bathing suit and flip flops, this is not the place for you. This is absolutely a more fun and casual place, where you can easily run from your room to the beach to the pool and back, and it is a springboard for anything you could possibly want to do on the island.On the pool level of the hotel is Tiki's Grill and Bar, which is still one of our favorite restaurants in the entire area. The food is great, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is really nice. We did not go to any of the Happy Hours there, but it was always busy, and we enjoyed hearing the live music in the evenings.On the street level, there is a convenience store, a Wolfgang Puck's Express, a Coldstone Creamery, a Subway sandwich shop, the Cookie Corner, and two gift shops. Right nearby is LuLu's Waikiki restaurant (also great), an ABC convenience store, and a Starbucks.I know that other reviewers talked about the size of the room and the size of the lanai. We have traveled a lot, and there are many places, like Waikiki, in which space is at a premium. I have stayed in hotels in New York City as well as other popular places where the rooms are smaller and the prices are higher. Also, having traveled to the Jersey Shore a lot, we know a good beach hotel when we see one!I would make some suggestions to management, however.  I think that the rule that a guest can go into the breakfast line only once causes people to ""stock up"" and probably take a lot more stuff than they would otherwise take. It is much, much nicer to pick up a couple of things and then just go back if you are still hungry. I don't know why this change was made, but I actually think it is to the detriment of the service. Honestly, it was shocking to see people stockpiling food, and I am sure it is because of the ""one time only"" rule. Also, the pool hours are kind of short ( I am still thinking about our first time there, when the pool was open later in the evenings). Sometimes when you come back from a long and busy day, it would be really nice to take a dip in the pool. 8 PM seems kind of early to close. There might be a good reason for this--perhaps because of insurance--so I don't know if this can change. And, while I fully understand how commonplace an amenity fee is, I would still rather just see it built into the room rate. This is more a general statement on charging an amenity fee separately rather than a criticism of this particular hotel. The amenity fee here covers the continental breakfast, beach/pool towels, folding chairs, a daily newspaper, and unlimited DVD and game rentals (which we did not use, but guests with younger kids used the DVD and game rental a lot).We know that this hotel listens to its guests and we have seen changes (such as the improved elevator service) attesting to this fact. After our fourth stay, I can still say that we highly recommend the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel.",USA,"Lu-AnnR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>USA</strong>",94,5.0

It's time for an update for sure. While we were aware of the extra fees at check-in, it was clear that other guests were not. There seem to be lots of arguments happening.

I didn't need 5 stars because I am here to see Hawaii not stay in my room. My room was a typical hotel room, good view, not overly large but enough for 2 people and most important it was clean. Yes there was some wind noise, but I have that at my house when it is very windy, but it didn't keep me up at night.Breakfast was typical of some smaller hotel chains continental breakfast, but I was certainly able to fill up on fresh fruit, cereal, donuts and yogurt each morning. At a busy hotel breakfast around the pool was full up so we would take our food to the tables outside the street level restaurants and there was always a table. Check in check out was a breeze. and the elevator system is different but once we got the hang of it is much better than the typical elevator that stops on every floor. We appreciated the free towel and chair service that lets you take them to the beach across the street.This hotel is at one end of the strip, but there is convience stores, fast food and ice cream very close. Also the hotel has tour bus and trolley stops out front. This is also very convient when we wanted to go to shopping or on our island tours. If you are facing that side of the hotel you can hear them and they do start early in the morning, but Honolulu is a big city and it is no different than what I have heard from my hotels in Chicago or New York.I found this hotel to be very satisfactory and met my criteria and would stay here again because of its location and value. You won't find a better hotel right on Waikiki beach without paying significantly more per night.","London, Ontario, Canada","Steve S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, Ontario, Canada</strong>",7,4.0

I am a Travel Agent in the UK so have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world but comparing price, location, value for money and standard of accommodation you cant beat this hotel. No its not 5* but it doesn't advertise itself as being either, compare the price to other properties in Waikiki, which I do every year, I have to say that this hotel still comes out top.We have been coming to Hawaii since 1990 so we have stayed it other properties to be able to compare them but so far we are more than happy with the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel and Its a property that I have no problems in recommending to my customers. The breakfast is an added bonus, we find it more that adequate, the bags provided are big enough to fill with cereal, fruit, bagels and pastry's to keep you going all day, no there aren't a lot of chairs to sit in around the pool on busy days but every single person has a room/ balcony with plenty of space to sit and eat breakfast or the beach is no more than a minutes walk away. The views are amazing from this hotel, we choose an ocean view. My only one concern is that the hotel doesn't out price itself.

We stayed on the 15th floor in room 1534. The view was amazing! Our room was small with 2 double beds, and had a handicap accessible bathroom. It was well worth the price! The only negative was that we had endless problems with the air conditioning & the wi-fi in our room. We had to call the service desk several times during our stay. They always responded promptly and fixed the problem, but it was a nuisance. The hotel is located at the east end of Waikiki beach next to the zoo, and across from the beach. It is a lot quieter at this end, but a further walk to many of the fun restaurants & shops. It was really convenient to have a mini-mart in the hotel, 2 ABC stores down below us, a Coldstone Creamery, a Subway, a Cookie store, and a Wolfgang Puck Express right below our hotel! And I can't forget Tiki's, the restaurant in our hotel! They had the best Pina Colada in town! And Lulu's next door for breakfast - the best banana macadamia nut pancakes with coconut syrup! And even the Barefoot Beachside Cafe down the beach across from the zoo had amazing breakfasts and lunches! Their coconut smoothie was to die for!The employees were very helpful & friendly - from Kathy at check-in, to Edmund the service guy, to Zeny our housekeeper (a sweetie!), to the valets. Our little girl was in a wheelchair and everyone went out of their way to be kind and helpful to her.The only possible negative was that the ""Breakfast on the Beach"" that they provide requires you to get down to it early if you want anything! They advertise that it is from 6:30-9:00. However, when I went down to it one morning at 6:30, there was already a line of about 75 people! One day I went down to it at 8:20 only to find that the staff had already put away all of the food/tables - nothing was left but coffee & juices! On vacation I hate to have to set the alarm to get up early enough to go get breakfast for free, but every penny saved helps!

We were upgraded to an ocean view room, but the wind whistled through the sliding door. When the whistling stopped, the doors rattled. The small fridge was being defrosted and was left open & switched on with a towel in the bottom to catch the water. We actually switched the unit off to enable it to defrost a little quicker so wwe could put drinks in it. There were holes in the bed linen. We also assumed that we would find a kettle & cups in the room to enable us to make coffee/tea, but there were none. At breakfast, I had to ""shoo"" the birds off the food as there were no covers over the food to keep the birds away. After watching the birds pecking at the pastries, we refused to eat them.

We had a decent view of the beach & the city leading to the zoo. Our room was kept very cold the entire time; our balcony was just enough space other than you really shouldn't think privacy when using the balcony because the adjacent hotels will be able to see you too. We were given a king sized bed, right by the exit stairs which was rarely used, plenty of room inside the room, with a slide door closet, a safe, a good size LED tv, a mini fridge, several sets of plugin outlets; the bathroom wasn't huge but large enough to use. It was decently cleaned although I found some areas dirty around the bottom of the toilet but hey it wasn't my bathroom! They provide an iron, board, & blow dryer & an up close mirror which was handy. The only thing missing was a microwave so avoid things needing to be warmed up.

Now for the free breakfast, I personally thought it was plentiful enough providing several choices of coffee, cereals, yogurts, variety of breads including Hawaiian malasdas (delicious), juices, a bar to order waffles and omelettes for a price, miso soup, seaweed, steamed rice patty, milk, fresh fruit. In order to get thru the line with choice fruit & such plan on getting down there about 7-730 am.

Myself, my son and daughter arrived to this beautiful and very affordable hotel literally on Waikiki Beach and we were instantly in awe! The grounds are very well kept, the restaurants were plentiful and the view - breathtaking. The front desk was very prompt and extremely courteous, and made our check in process easy. We couldn't wait to see our room and when we opened the door, it was gorgeous! We just sat there for a few and took it all in. The bedding and upkeep of the room was perfect and more than we had expected. The view wasn't great from the balcony, but there were many, many rooms where the view was spectacular...we just didn't care about that. Everything was clean and functional. The hotel itself was amazing and everyone was courteous. There was a fair sized pool but it was usually occupied by small children so we opted to walk the 100 feet to the beachfront instead and enjoy the warm ocean and dreamy sands of Waikiki beach. The convenience of staying so close to the beach is more than I can explain. There are many hotels nearby but some are a little ways away from the beachfront and most are much more expensive. During our stay, there was an announcement back home that family had notified me about regarding the recall of eggs due to some sort of contamination. This concerned me as I had been eating eggs every morning during our stay, so I approached the front desk and they thoroughly researched it, then reassured me it did not affect Hawaii. The options for food on the hotel premises were great and decent priced. Anyone who's traveled to Hawaii knows how dreadfully expensive everything is there, so having some affordable and good food nearby was good. The beach offered surfing very close by, the zoo was only a short walk away, and there are tons of stores, restaurants and events happening in the area. The only downside to staying near the beach were the homeless and intoxicated people at night and early morning. This is definitely not a reflection of the hotel but it's worth mentioning. The reside in the pavillion areas of the beachfront and although they are not really threatening, I wouldn't suggest spending any time close to that particular area.","Boston, Massachusetts","Samantha M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",40,5.0

We had a partial ocean view room, so if you stuck your head out far enough on the very small balcony you could see the ocean. The room was clean and comfortable enough, but the major issue we had was that every time we had a shower and I must state it is a very small shower our bathroom flooded, so hence we went through a lot of towels. The breakfast on the beach idea was fine, but after a few days I really wanted a piece of toast with vegemite as all the sugary breakfast treats don't really appeal to me and I was purchasing my own breakfast somewhere else. The one thing that I would recommend to the hotel is to please have a kettle or tea or coffee facilities in the room, as after a long day all you want is to sit in your room and enjoy a cuppa.

We had an oceanfront room and fantastic views, albeit from the tiniest balcony I've ever seen. The room was clean, and adequately appointed, but a few minor things caused some inconvenience. The stopper in our sink would not stay closed (making it hard to soak and wash swimsuits), and the stopper in the tub would not stay open while showering resulting in the tub filling each time you showered. The air conditioning in the room was useless. We were there during some unseasonably warm and humid weather in mid-July and there was NO relief by turning on the A/C. I was a sticky hot mess the entire vacation! The blow dryer in the bathroom did not work which would have been a major inconvenience (I didn't bring my own) had I not found an extra one in the closet. How difficult is it to replace a wall-mounted blow dryer though really? Another suggestion I would make is to PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE put a $15 coffee maker in the room for pete's sake! The hotel doesn't even need to provide the coffee, but being able to have a cup before heading out for the day would have been nice. Sure there is coffee to go downstairs, but you need to ask for a cup, and are allotted ONE 6oz. styrofoam cup! If I wanted a refill, I would have had to stay by the pool area, drink it, and refill or hike back and forth from my room. The ice machine on our floor never worked the 6 days we were there and we had to go down 4 floors before finding one that worked. I am aware that most of the hotels in Waikiki charge an amenity fee, but the $18/day fee here is pretty much a rip-off. On vacation I don't really read a newspaper. I don't really want to spend my time in Waikiki renting and watching movies in my room, and the complimentary breakfast is hardly worth $18/day. I could not eat $18 worth of pastries and yogurt daily to make it worthwhile! Lastly, having our privacy invaded one afternoon for a room search by ""Security"" because some whacko in the room next to us said we were smoking in our room (WHICH WE WERE NOT) was irritating to say the least. Housekeeping cleans your room daily. If we were smoking, wouldn't they have known and reported it? Upon speaking with the front desk, we were told if there was evidence of smoking in our room we would be charged $425 after checkout. I certainly didn't like the idea that they could tack on that kind of charge after we were long gone, but there was no charge, so I guess our neighbor was wrong, huh? An okay hotel, but we wouldn't return.","Tracy, California","JudiW52</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tracy, California</strong>",7,3.0

We came to see Hawaii, not a hotel. We had been travelling in North America for six weeks ( San Fran, Niagara, New York, Pennsylvania , Asheville, North & South Carolina , Florida, British Colombia in Canada etc) so have seen and experienced a lot of hotels.Pro's - beds comfy; hotel is in great location; service in hotel was fine, breakfast was nice and ample in terms of types and amount of food.Cons - there are hidden costs associated (at least $50 per day) which I found offensive and misleading, and did not experience elsewhere; the pool is very small, with heavy restrictions on use and hours of opening .. I also found it laughable that the hotel was gloating about the complimentary pool towels and chairs ... Where else to sit, and how do you dry yourself !! ( what's next .... Gloating about complimentary toilet paper !! ). My daughter berated the hotel because of the tacky/kitschy beach bag, colouring book, bucket and spade that fell apart when you merely looked at it !! (I had to agree - if you are going to go to that effort, make the experience pleasant) Despite being told we had a partial ocean view room, we only looked at the neighbouring hotel (about 15 metres away) .. If you dared lean over the balcony you could see the ocean however.The room, but particularly the bathroom, was not properly cleaned before we moved into it .... There was hair in the bath, hand basin, and on the floor. The bathroom needs an overhaul ... Very tired, dated and dirty.The breakfast arrangements are weird, and born of a hotel that is trying to offer a service it was never designed for - there are very few tables available, they give you a cooler bag and 'prompt' you to try breakfast on the beach, and you are fighting the masses to get fed (we were there at 6.30 when it starts due to jet lag, and it was already packed out) . My advice - take the fed bag down to the pool where the food is, fill it up, then go back to your room to eat !!",Australia,"Justcritic</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",6,3.0

The ""breakfast on the beach"" was really just a buffet style grab your own and go, which would be great but the options aren't very good so we skipped breakfast there pretty much the entire time.

Waikiki beach is across the street. This hotel is at the end of the hotel rows so if you are ok with walking to the different shops then this is a good value hotel in a good location. There is an amenities fee of 15/day, they give you wi-fi as well as use of towels and chairs when you go to the beach. I think this is reasonable enough as the chair rental on the beach is $20/day. So make sure to get your folding chairs and towels at the lobby before you go to the beach. You don't need to return so you can have it as long as your stay. The room is ok with 2 beds, we are at room 1408 and it's a corner room so it's not as small as others described.

We've been decently satisfied with the quality. Breakfast is a bit crowded but we just bring our food back up to our hotel room. I like the idea of taking breakfast onto the beach. However, I don't like how there is only one entry per room and how there is limited selection and omelettes must be paid for on top of the resort fee. The beds are nice and big but the bathroom is on the small side. I don't mind the decor or think that the hotel is particularly outdated. It is older than most but if you are coming to Hawaii to stay in your hotel room, you should probably go to the Hilton or something (and maybe rethink your holiday). The view was spectacular and the location was great. We have had no quarrels with service, everyone is friendly. Improvements that I can think of are a broader breakfast selection - maybe increase resort fee by a dollar and include omelettes, larger bathrooms, more pool chairs and tables and tea and coffee making facilities in hotel rooms. The elevator system was confusing but not impossible and was similar to the other nearby hotels. One personal issue we had was the annoyance of arriving at 9am and having to wait until after 3pm to check in. We were new to the country and tired from a 10 hour flight with no sleep overnight. We tried to sit next to the pool for a bit...walked down the streets...then came back up to the pool and waited until 3. It was a long wait and our hotel room was VERY inviting when we got there!

We arrived an hour early and was told we could not check in so had to sit around the pool area with all our luggage, not pleasant considering all we wanted to do was relax and get changed into cooler clothing. When we were finally able to check in we were then told there was a daily surcharge of $12 per day which we thought was already paid for within our booking, apparently not. The room was so small, 2 double beds with less than a metre between them and we had to use one of the beds to put our luggage on because had we used the floor space we would not have had any room to walk around. The bathroom was just as tiny and very dated. The only plus to the room was the view to the ocean. Breakfast was a disappointment, mostly sugared pastries and cakes, there was no cooked breakfast unless you wanted to pay more. What was the $12 a day for???? Certainly not the breakfast as after day 3 we didn't bother with breakfast at all. Once you got your breakfast there was nowhere to sit to eat it unless you wanted to sit around on the pool deck chairs while balancing your food on your lap. There was only approximately 6 outdoor tables and chairs which were always taken up so the only other alternative is to go back to the room or across the road to the park to eat. Not satisfactory at all, catering for all guests in a breakfast room as well as around the pool would be a better alternative. The entertainment at breakfast was lovely to listen to with the Hawaiian music and singing but that's about it. This hotel is located well for use of the street trolley cars as the stop is right out the front and the free DVD's were good when you don't feel like going out for the evening. The tour booking desks are also a great addition to this hotel with the staff being very helpful. We would not stay at this hotel again instead would pay a little more to receive a better room and a few decent options for breakfast as well as at least somewhere to eat it.

What is your standard “norm” for staying at hotels? Do you normally stay at Quality Inn and other 3 star hotels? Or do you frequent Sheratons, Marriotts and Hiltons?If three star, the Aston Waikiki fits into that category. There are many great things about this hotel especially if you have children. For a couple, it may not be as ideal. We were not looking to splurge on the hotel for this trip and knew this wouldn’t be a four-star, but was hoping for the best. If you are unsure whether to lower your standard, my advice is to spend the extra few hundred dollars and book the nicer hotel.This hotel is not modern and since it is dated and in need of major updates – it did not come across as clean to me. There are a lot of positives about it, but not the rooms. We knew we wouldn’t spend a lot of time in the room, but after a long day, there is nothing better on vacation then coming back to relax in your room. I didn’t find the room inviting to relax. Too dated, in need of updates. Walls were dirty, bathroom worn down, very small overall in size.2. Do you have kids/family that you are traveling with?For a family, I think this hotel is much more ideal. It’s close to everything that most families may want. Across from beach, restaurants and hotel that are kid friendly are all around, a small pool, free DVDs, etc. For couples looking for a low-key, quiet getaway – the hotel is very busy and bustling.3. How important is hotel view to you?The view at the Aston is just incredible (we did ocean view). It was amazing to wake up to the view of the beach every morning. All in all, not a bad place – just check your expectations/standards before you book and the rooms are definitely not the highlight. Good locale, some nice perks, nice views, Tiki’s is great and live music is nice. All depends on what you are looking for.","West Hartford, Connecticut","abkm3379</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Hartford, Connecticut</strong>",26,3.0

High end shopping, low end ABC stores, restaurants, bars, Starbucks and fast food places abound within 15 minute walking distance. I can recommend it for those satisfied with mid range accommodations. It has a small pool overlooking the beach but it is not a relaxing pool area as it is choked with sun loungers and hotel guests. The rooms are on the small side but with adequate space around the beds. As I was on vacation, I requested an upgrade to a junior suite, which has nice views and sitting area. We paid $100 more per day for the upgrade. The beddings were of good quality, water pressure strong, free wifi, free very poor quality basic breakfast. The room was clean and tasteful.

Check-in is late at 3pm and for international travellers that almost always means your room won't be ready on arrival. We stayed here for six days initially then travelled around other islands and came back for a final night. On both occasions as we wanted a room immediately we paid to upgrade to an ocean front room. The views from these rooms is sensational and immediately in front of the hotel is a safe swimming area. Most buses stop at the hotel so it's very easy to get around - once you find someone who explains how it all works. That in itself took a while. I thought the rooms were lovely - yes dated in part, but they were bright and colourful. The one thing I found very strange was there was no kettle in the room. There is a small fridge though which was great for keeping water and wine in! Breakfast is bizarre - a bring your own cold bag (provided in the room) and fill it with fruit, cereal boxes and sugary treats - then take it to the beach or your balcony - we found the latter the best option. After our first breakfast when we had fruit juice, fruit, fruit yoghurt and muffins we felt sugar overload. From then on we stuck to coffee, croissants, fresh fruit and plain yoghurt if we could find one. You pay more for omelettes. There is an $18 a day resort fee which gives you this 'continental' breakfast, access to DVDs, free local phone calls and wi-fi access - the only useful thing about it. There are booking agents on the lobby level who all charge you more than if you book direct with the tour operators. Decide what you want to do and book it direct. Avoid all the hawkers on the streets who try to sell you trips - but are really selling time-share.

A little cooler is provided for you to gather what you want at breakfast - one pass through the line is what is expected. Most don't go to the beach, but there are not enough tables by the pool for all to eat. We learned it was best to go back to the room and eat at the nice table or on the balcony overlooking the surfers! Save your coffee cup. One can get coffee @ 6am, but then they remove the cups sometime after 6:30 am & you can get a refill only if you have kept your cup. Had plenty of decafe which was great for me! Eggs and waffles cost extra. Breads of all kinds and fruits were fabulous. Definitely try the purple bread & donuts made with taro root!! Lots of wonderful juices. The elevators are unique. To go down enter any floor number or star to get to the check-in floor. To go up, swipe your door key and enter the floor - look at that display for info on which elevator will take you there. I believe there were 5 elevators so waits were never long. There is an open area on each floor that faces Diamond Head - so walk to that area near the ice machine and get your pictures.Both restaurants were good for their purpose. Wolfgang Puck is fast - take out or eat right there.A zoo is between the hotel and Diamond Head. If we'd had a free morning I would have liked to hike Diamond Head.

They were drinking and partying in the hallway and slamming doors every couple of minutes or so. This went on for approx 5-6 hrs, late into the night. I called the front desk 3 times and was assured it would be taken care of, but it wasn't. I even had the privilege of listening to a very angry Australian woman (another guest) finally lose her temper with these very inconsiderate young people. I really feel like the hotel dropped the ball; security came up several times but never got things under control. The hotel did offer us another room on another floor (the next day), but I did not want to go through the whole check-in/check-out, get settled in thing again. Why should I have to? The morning breakfast was nice, not the best food, but nice atmosphere with the ukelele, singing, and hula dancing. And the bar is nice to relax and have a drink. Overall, it was not a horrible experience, but it wasn't as positive as our first experience. I'm not sure I'd stay again... I'd have to really think about it.","Albuquerque, New Mexico","LisaC1968</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Albuquerque, New Mexico</strong>",6,3.0

This was my first trip to Hawaii so I sprung for an ocean view. The room (king size bed) was spacious for two people and nicely decorated. The hotel staff members were quite helpful starting with someone who gave directions when we got off the shuttle. After a short wait at check-in, someone else assisted us with directions on how to use the keycard operated elevator. The view was absolutely amazing. The location was convenient to lots of hotels and shops. Some reviewers commented on poor air conditioning--we could have refrigerated our room. We left the next morning at 3:30am and the desk staff was helpful and cheerful (with coffee) when we checked out. If I have an opportunity to visit Honolulu again, I will definitely consider this hotel when we return if we want to be on Waikiki. It is not the newest hotel on the block and some of the fixtures are dated, but the floor where our room was happened to be clean and inviting. Our bathroom was spotless (albeit with older tile and fixtures).Reviewers have commented on the $18 resort amenity fee. The hotel website was clear and upfront about this charge. I do quite a bit of traveling and while I don't like these extra charges, it is not unusual to pay extra fees in resort areas, even in places much less exotic than Waikiki.  I recommend the Aston Waikiki Beach very highly.","Fayetteville, GA","hemathtchr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fayetteville, GA</strong>",17,5.0

From our floor, we could only get downstairs by pressing 3 (reception area) then take the escalator or another elevator to get to the lobby. Odd. To get our car, valet recommended that we call them before we head down because it takes about 15 minutes for our car to come around. Wireless internet was SLOWWW (Oceanic Time Warner).

It is very dated, dirty, smelly and in need of a big overhaul. There was no welcome on arrival - just “what's your name” and told the lobby was on the next floor up. Reception was no better. We were asked our name, told there was a compulsory amenities fee charge of US$18.00 per night to cover breakfast, internet and DVD movies - even if we didn't want any of those services. We were given our room keys and no explanation about the hotel lift system to your room (nothing like a normal lift system). Our first room was in the ""back blocks"" on the 15th floor. We paid for a full ocean view - that we didn’t get (we did go back to reception and advise that we had paid for an ocean view and were told that this was classed as an ocean view). The room was very smelly and in need of a good clean, paint and refit. Outside our door we had the drinks vending machine, ice machine and housekeeping supply room - the first night we had no sleep from the noise. My partner complained in the middle of the night and was told that they would move us up to the 20th floor away from the machines. When come time to move in the morning – we were told “no the room wasn't ready, it needed some maintenance”. After requesting to see the manager on duty to complain about the service and room we had been given, we were advised that would be moved, not to the room on the 20th floor, but further round to the main part of the hotel and it would be an upgrade to ""one of their deluxe rooms at no extra charge"". We had to wait until after 3.00pm to access the room. When we finally got to the room - the only upgrade was one extra bedside table and a little better view (although you also looked into the next hotel’s rooms as part of the view). The room was still dirty (even though they said it had been cleaned), in need of a paint, a refit and noisy. We wanted to leave, but we had paid nearly AUS$2,000 for the week’s accommodation and there were defiantly no refunds!Breakfast was the next little surprise - they gave you a little cooler bag to take with you to have ""breakfast by the pool or take it to the beach"". The breakfast was very basic, some of the food was stale and you had foam cups with lids that didn't fit, paper bags, and plastic knives, spoons and forks to eat with. Finding somewhere to site to eat was a joke - a hotel with about 600 rooms provides approximately 50 chairs!!! They had a guitar player and one girl dancing while you ate the breakfast - great, except people sat there all morning and occupied the chairs - everyone else missed out on sitting down. Not many people took their breakfast to the beach, they all took the food up to their room - thus spilling milk, hot water and food everywhere on the walking areas and in the lifts. On many occasions this was not cleaned up for ages. From what we could see there were very few housekeeping staff employed.If you wanted to swim in the small pool, you had to put up with floating bits of food and rubbish from the morning’s breakfast (all the mornings we were there were windy) . The pool surrounds – the concrete around it was very uneven, parts of it missing and the paint flaking off in most areas. The only things you are provided with in your room as one glass each - no provisions for tea and coffee. The air-conditioner is aimed right at the sleeping area (you cannot change this) and you can't open the window/sliding door as there are no flyscreens and it is far too noisy.The hotel was over the road from the beach and we are guessing this is what the hotel sells itself on – after chatting to other people, there are much, much better hotels with similar locations.We are not sure how this hotel has received such good reviews on Trip Advisor. We will never stay again and we have advised our Travel Agent not to book anyone else at the hotel.","Melbourne, Australia","5658aussie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",6,1.0

It's within a few short block walk of the Honolulu Zoo and Kapiʻolani Park one direction as well as the International Marketplace the other so very central within Waikiki. I opted for my 2 night stay an ocean view room and was on the 16th floor with an excellent unobstructed view along Waikiki toward the Royal Hawai'ian Hotel (Pink Palace). The balcony was a little smaller than expected but you got used to it after a while, though those with height issues take note. There wasn't direct sun in the morning so really liked having my breakfast on the balcony in the shade while watching the stunning scenery below. The BOB (Breakfast on Beach) is a continental breakfast the hotel offers that comes with a small cooler bag in your room which you fill up at food stations on the pool deck and can then take to either the beach, your room or consume on the chairs around the pool. There were pastries, donuts, cereals, fruit, yogurt and juices included and should you want made to order omelettes there is an extra $5 charge for that.Staying solo my room was plenty big enough for one but can imagine a family of 4 finding it a tighter fit, especially given the bathroom is smaller than others I'd seen on O'ahu. The bathroom also comes without a fan and besides being smaller is also showing it's age with discolored tiles covered by a matt. There was good water pressure and the hot water took only a few seconds to arrive so was happy with that. I did hear from some staff that room renovations are coming later this year so hope they do spruce up the room fittings as I feel they could use it. One other thing I had to consciously remember to do each time I went out was to firmly shut the door as it wouldn't always close by itself as most hotel room doors do. Everything in the room was in working order and nothing was very obviously broken or damaged but you could see the wear & tear over the years in places.I didn't check out Tiki's Grill & bar which is next to the pool as most nights it seemed full or almost full. It has a retro vintage Hawai'i theme with big tiki statues, fishnets and a volcano and has live music though luckily doesn't play too loud or too late into the night. There is a $18/night ""daily amenity fee"" that covers the breakfast on beach, in-room Wi-Fi, free local & toll-free calls, in-room safe, newspaper & PS3 PlayStation so factor that in when making hotel comparisons. I understand these costs were previously charged separately and could add up for some guests but for those like me who don't need a newspaper, play video games, use in-room Wi-Fi or make calls what used to cost a few dollars a day in misc. charges is now $18 and is mandatory so has an impact. Sadly Aston isn't the only hotel chain adding these resort fees but think the cost is too high.The staff were warm & welcoming and so helped make for a pleasant stay and this along with a good location helped balance off a few small drawbacks about the room. I'd be curious to visit again after some upcoming renovations as it will hopefully make what is a good hotel better.","Edmonton, Canada","tcook052</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",247,4.0

The room though was very dated. With no disrespect to the staff, this hotel is a bit of a dive. The hotel is clearly a 60s or 70s refurb, the ocean front rooms are tiny and the balconies awful. We were on L8. The bed was hard, the bathroom paint job dated...overall a massive miss. The breakfast is okay if you like lots of sugary donuts, bread and muffins. The fruit is hard and unripe. Expect lots of drunk under 25s and families. For the second visit running I couldn't stomach a swim in the pool, it is too small and too crowded. With a bevy of homeless people to greet you on the street, I couldn't recommend this unless you have very low expectations. The Marriott across the road, or even Astons boutique looking Hotel Renew next door might be an option. Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this one needs an overhaul.

Whilst I appreciate that they deal with this often, it would have been kind of them to have waived one of the late fees, ie/ the early or late charge. My room rate ended up being $300-ish for one night which caused me to make a note to never return. The hotel was busy, the staff were pleasant enough but this is not a warm, intimate Hawaiian haven. This is a large property that pumps them in and out every day. Based on my experience with early and late fees, the hotel is doing just fine financially, thank you very much. The pool is located just off of the lobby and was extremely busy and full of kids. The location was indeed great, mere steps to the beach and completely surrounded by shops, bars and restaurants. The room was just 'ok'. It smelled very musty, the furnishings, etc were very 70's era and the property in general was quite tacky and cold. The balcony was small and lacked any privacy at all.

We made the breakfast the last day but if we could have opted out we would have. I would say the amenity fee was not a good value for us. The supplied food was average and I've had better continental breakfasts at Hampton for no additional fee (with hot eggs, meat and waffles.)

Our bartender even looked up and made my favorite island drink - the Goombay Smash!Our rooms had a direct view of Waikiki beach and I recommend that option. It was a great view and wish we could have spent more time enjoying it. We were able to get chairs for the beach but they were short on beach towels and we had to settle for bath towels at times.Their pool is nice but morning sun is limited and it crowds quickly. We were lucky enough to be there during the International Hula Conference and got an awesome free hula show - fantastic!Compared to other hotels in the area I think this is the best value.

This was not my first trip to Waikiki and I've stayed at numerous other hotels (Moana Surfrider, Holiday Inn, Hyatt Regency, Marriott, Sheraton). I decided on the Aston because of its location and price. I don't regret staying there but I'm not sure I would stay there again.the good: the location is tremendous. just about the last hotel on the strip closest to Diamond Head. Which means you have all the access to the bars and restaurants yet it's quiet. the elevators are efficient, fast, and pretty cool (no one tries to stick their hand in to catch the elevator at the last second). the breakfast buffet looked popular, but we didn't try it. easy to grab beach chairs and towels and walk across the street - or take to your rental car for the day. Tiki's was a good place to grab a drink and some appetizers - we met some great servers there and would recommend it for the view and the ambiance (the food was just OK too!). there are two mai tai's there - the regular one (which is just eh) and the 1944 mai tai (which is awesome). the view was great from our premium oceanfront room. they have a neat movie system there where you can pick out a dvd movie to watch for free...kind of like a red box in the lobby. but the selection wasn't stellar -- plus what are we doing watching movies in Hawaii anyway? the bad: you know you're in a 3 star hotel because it feels like it. It's a bit outdated and a bit worn, and you feel like you might not eat off the night stands (but then again, that's why you're staying there - to get a break..if you're there for your honeymoon, spring for the Marriott next door or one of the swanky places down the strip). the room was ok - there were some weird stains on the ceiling and door, but I wasn't grossed our or anything. the bathroom is small and outdated, but the water pressure is stellar. the balconies are tiny - only a chair and ottoman. we used the ottoman as a second chair and it was fine. prepare to get to know your neighbors - the balconies are not only small, but they are very close. as in inches apart. We saw the same people on their balconies all the time and you have to acknowledge them because it's kind of awkward if you don't (""oh, good morning...beautiful day, isn't it?""). way too uncomfortable. the hallways are kind of dark and not very beachy (I think it's all the red and browns). the gym is really awful. I'm OK with tiny, but there is no view and, more importantly, the equipment is old and didn't work properly. here's a pro tip - if you drive past the hotel onto Montserrat St you can park there and overnight. we did and saved $$$. Overall: I don't think I'd stay here again because there are nicer budget hotels in Waikiki - and better budget hotels with the same, gorgeous view (minus the awkward encounters with the neighbors). but the hotel tries and everyone is really nice - and you're in Hawaii, so get out of your hotel anyway!",nyc,"tripper24nyc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>nyc</strong>",35,3.0

It is kinda obsolete to have a fridge if you can't heat up what you keep in there. Also, the view.

The amenity fee is pretty pointless they should just include it in the room price, we didn't borrow the DVD's we had seen most of the movies.

At that point they said that our partial view room was ready so we can go on ahead. Score! +5 for convenienceHotel: hip and trendy decorations. +1. Friendly staff, interesting ""high tech"" elevators. +1. No little kids pressing every button before you get to your floor! Location: absolutely superb. Walking distance to all major shopping areas, literally across the street from the beach. Moped rental place right behind the hotel, and car rental place less than a mile walk away. +5. Also one of the best bar + bar staff + drinks IN hotel +5Room: cute decor. View upgrade is totally worth it, even at partial view. Waikiki Beach at sunset and sunrise on the balcony while having a glass of wine or FREE orange juice was just wonderful (free breakfast is provided every day). +5Though I enjoyed staying here, and wouldn't mind staying again, a few complaints:- my bedsheet had a hole in it -3- parking at $27 per night is highway robbery. Price was comparable to other hotels in the area, and I didn't rent for the entire duration of my trip so was able to save a few bucks, but still, expensive -3- the elevators are cool, except when what seemed like 100 HS kids were checking in and kept scanning their cards over and over and kept getting reassigned, causing delays. And there's no ""take the stairs to your floor"" option. -5- I had a couple ants on the table due to a fresh lei--do hotels get ants? I wiped away the ""lei juice"" and they disappeared by the time I left for the beach and came back -5- housekeeping did not replace my shampoo/conditioner/etc., had to special request these. -3So, using my own method of scoring (with more points for really important things and less for not so important), I put the Aston at a 4. :)","Los Angeles, California","claud09</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",5,4.0

I had read a lot of the reviews from TA beforehand so I decided to send them a direct email right after booking online in which I stated the purpose of our trip and what we were expecting. The hotel replied the same day saying that all my points were well noted and that they would do their best to fulfill our requests. Upon arrival I was not disappointed at all and felt they had actually taken my points into consideration to give us a great room.After 10 days there here are what I can say to help you decide:- If you want to see the ocean well, book an ""Ocean view select"" room. While it is a bit more expensive than a ""partial ocean view"" or ""ocean view"", the ""select"" guarantees you are on a higher floor (20 to 25). We ended up on the 25th floor and very close to the sea side so our view was an unobstructed view of the entire Waikiki bay. We could see the Friday Hilton fireworks from the balcony. Fabulous for the price I think.Also, floors higher up are more quiet and it was one of our requirement so it was perfect. - Our room had 1 door separating us from the next one, and they seem to all go in pairs like this. It must be to be able to reunite families who book 2 rooms. I had no complaint about it but if our neighbors had been noisy or partying in their room it would have been a problem I think. I guess it's like at home: there's always a bit of luck with whom you get as neighbors.- Some reviews complain about the $18 resort fee per day but I do think that fee is not outrageous at all compared to other hotels which ALL charge one (and if they don't this means you have nothing). We used the room safe, the breakfast, the towels, the DVD (rain on a couple of days), the wi-fi and everything worked as advertised. We did not go to the gym room and forgot to check it out.- Breakfast every day with the little tote bag is great. I ended up going downstairs to get it and bringing it back to the room as our balcony had a great view. It's true that the pool area gets filled up quickly but if you go early you might be able to get a spot. The musician and the dancer are such a peaceful addition to the scene. The breakfast selection was truly good for us: a selection of cereals, yoghourt, cut fruits, danishes (including croissants, doughnuts, muffins), coffee, and even miso soup and onigiri. If you want an omelet you must pay extra but I can understand that since it's made upon order.- We used the included towel service to get some to go to the beach and return them at the end of the day. And for days when you return late (after 7pm) you can leave them at the reception and there's no fee. I saw other hotels not even including that while their resort fee was much higher. - Cleaning service was really good and efficient during our stay. Very discreet, no loud noise and so courteous when we saw them in the hallway. Definitely happy with their daily service for our room.- The location is, in my opinion, very very good because it is at the end of the stretch, next to a very green park that makes you feel you're not in the urban jungle that Waikiki is, yet you are literally less than 10 minutes by foot from the Moana Surfrider, which represents a sort of center point. If you want to hike Diamond head you are next to it, you have the volleyball courts right there and surf concession on the beach. - Parking is expensive since you have to valet but the private shuttle service we used to go from the airport (hawaii23.com, I recommend them. Mark is a very nice person) to the hotel told us that there's free street parking on Monsarrat Ave and that is 1 block from the hotel using the sea side. We used that for 3 nights and did not have a problem. Many cars park there and there are always empty spots scattered. Since it is recommended to leave the doors unlocked wherever you park (even Budget told me that) we did just that and everything was fine. Just don't leave anything in the car.- Plenty of convenience stores at every corner. Good Wolfgang Puck express downstairs that actually has very decent pizza and dishes. Starbucks on the corner and if you are tired of stbx just take a 200 yards walk sea side in front of the park and there's a little coffee/snack place that serves good Illy coffee with tables in front of the ocean for less than what stbx charges. Summary: I'd stay again at that hotel because it gives very good value for the price. It is right there on the ocean and the staff is very professional.Hope that will help you !","Nice, France","FoodScouter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nice, France</strong>",12,4.0

Upon arrival we went up the escalator to the hotel desk. It was awkward to find if you didn't know where to go. We checked in and the receptionist informed us that there was an $18 a day fee for internet, DVD rental, towels, newspaper and more. That added another $100 to our trip the moment we arrived. The room was clean. We got a king size room. The bride and groom got a room with two double beds becasue they have a 5 year old as well. You could barely walk around the beds once the luggage was in there. Our room wasn't like that at all. The one bed definitely had its perks. The view wasn't too great. There was a hotel right next to us and we could SEE IN the other hotel. A little creepy. We overlooked warehouse looking rooftops. We did have a view of the ocean looking to our right off the balcony.The room was simple with a dresser, TV, table, two chairs, and night stands. The bathroom was simple as well with three sets of towels. We did have to call on a daily basis and ask for new towels. It didn't ever take very long. Room service didn't come until very late in the afternoon on the 10th floor.We didn't spend a ton of time in the hotel, so for us it was just fine. Nothing to write home about. We did enjoy the fact that we were on the end of the commercialized strip. Waikiki Beach was literally across the street and wasn't ever packed like it was in the middle of the strip. We always found room and didn't feel like we were on top of the people next to us. You can check out towels and bring them to the beach, so no need to rbing your own like we did. They also check out chairs you can bring there as well. We didn't utlize the hotel. We're from MN and wanted to be on the beach!They had a continental breakfast each morning from 630a-9a. We ate here twice because we wanted to experience the food on the island. They do provide you a cooler to bring down to breakfast to take food back up to your hotel room/ Refridgerators are in each room. There is yogurt, cereal, pastries and you can buy an omelet for $5.All in all for simple purposes I would recommend this hotel if you like to explore and don't plan to be in your room a ton.

Breathtaking views of the beach to our right, Diamond Head straight on and the cityscape to our left. The complimentary coolers to pack up a continental breakfast and take them beachside was a big hit for us too. When we come back and YES that will happen, I will gladly bring my family back here.","Centennial, Colorado","April J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Centennial, Colorado</strong>",16,4.0

We were pleasantly surprised with what we got! The location is great! Right across the street from the beach, next to a lot of restaurants, and right next to the zoo. The room was clean and the view was spectacular (we got a partial ocean view room). The bathroom might have been a little outdated, but from what I hear about Waikiki, that's normal. I'm not usually picky about my bed and pillow, but it was a bit uncomfortable. You get breakfast with the room (fruit, yogurt, pastries, cereal - the basic continental options) with live music and they include a lunchbox in the room in case you want to pack some things for later. They also have a really neat DVD rental system that's included in the room price. Great idea for families! Their pool is not much to speak of, but who goes to Hawaii to stay by the pool? The best part was their tiki bar. We'd go every night to enjoy a drink and watch the sunset over the beach. Live music was a nice touch. If we ever to to Waikiki again, we'd definitely stay at the Aston!","San Diego, California","vagabond04</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",59,4.0

The hotel is in an excellent location; across the street is the beach, walk west on Kalakua Avenue you have all the activity & shopping and walk east you have the quiet of the park with the Zoo, Aquarium and band shell.The rooms are superb. The view from our lanai was outstanding. Rooms are clean and have plenty of room. The bathrooms are also very clean and well maintained. The king bed was exceedingly comfortable. The sheets must have a very high thread count as they are so soft, and are excellent for cleaning eyeglasses ;-). Some reviewers have a problem with the “dated décor.” The décor is not highly polished and glitzy, it is colourful with floral themes, very fitting for Hawaii. Most of the properties we have seen have rather similar décor even the newer properties.We felt that we received excellent value for our dollar. The resort fee covers a lot of value features. We really like the breakfast, filling our bags and enjoying it on our lanai. The music and hula dancer at the breakfast is truly first rate and truly Hawaiian. We didn’t use some of the things covered by the resort fee, but that’s the real world, other people do use them.The staff at this hotel is excellent. Every staff member we encountered on our stay performed their role with skill and a very friendly manner. Front desk, hospitality, pool, housekeeping, engineering and security personnel made our stay comfortable and pleasant. Observing the challenges the staff encounter every day and the positive manner with which they handle them is truly amazing.At the hotel, Tiki’s Grill and Bar is fantastic. The dining lounge cuisine is superb and the service is A1. Our meals were very well executed and the flavour was spot on. Try the butterfish or mahi mahi. The bar is also a very welcoming and relaxing place to spend time overlooking the beach. The service and drink selection are top notch. The bar menu is first rate (coconut shrimp & prime poke, yum yum). Entertainment is also exceptionally good, Vaihi rules. Wolfgang Puck’s Express, Subway, and Cold Stone Ice Cream are several nibbles spots on the street front of the hotel. The three times we have stayed have continued to reinforce that the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel is definitely our hotel of choice.",Edmonton,"mscholtzEdmonton</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton</strong>",29,5.0

This is a really nice hotel! It's clean, looks newly renovated and the staff were all wonderful, friendly and helpful. I booked an ocean view room and it was nice. The beds were fairly squishy for two, but comfy, with good donnas and pillows. View was great and overall the room was everything we needed (would of loved a kettle, but I guess that's not the American way). Now let's address the amenity fee. Yes, it's a pain and I don't understand why they don't just add it to the price. We all pay it, it's compulsory, why even mention it. However, we fully got our $18 a day. The breakfast was great. Again, not sure what other people are complaining about. Plenty of food and we ate there 6 mornings in a row at all different times. Yes, cereal and donuts get boring, but then so does spending $50 for breakfast! (what we spent on our first morning pre-checkin). We also hired a DVD each day (2 tired kids), which is included, so we were happy with the $18! They also advertise it everywhere, when you check in and again in your room, so no excuse not to be aware of it. Tiki's was also a nice place for a drink or meal. We enjoyed the $2 tacos and free beer on a Tuesday! Also had the best Kalua pig taco cups I have ever tasted!Service was also great, except for one lady at the tour desk, but I think she might have been about to leave and so wanted to get rid of me as quick as she could. I have to make special note of Lakai at the reception desk. I needed to scan and email an urgent document home and she happily scanned it for me and emailed it to me from her account. Location wise, I'm not sure you could ask for a better spot. Right on the water front and close to everything. I was actually surprised that most of the hotels are not on the beach but a couple of blocks away. The Aston made going to the beach really easy as it was only a couple of meters from the pool, so no carrying bags etc. Also the pink trolley that goes to Ala Moana the big shopping centre stops right outside the hotel. I guess if there was one thing it was that the hotel was packed and seemed to have numbers of groups of students (we saw a water polo team, cheerleading team and music group). But they were all great and so yes it was packed but I guess that's just life!Other reviewers have made comment on the homeless outside the hotel. Just wanted to point out the homeless are all along the main road and in fact we saw them all around Waikiki, so this is not particularly a problem for the Aston. These people are just down on their luck, are polite and certainly not threatening in anyway. A polite ""No thanks/sorry"" seemed to do the trick. All in all, had a great stay and would definitely stay here again if we return to Waikiki!","Bathurst, Australia","Furterbrown</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bathurst, Australia</strong>",141,5.0

The best thing about this Waikiki hotel is the 'Tiki Bar Restaurant and Bar' offering great food at reasonable price and where you can 'chill' for drink after a great day out sightseeing on this wonderful and beautiful island. Price was very competitive and I would stay here if I was to return to Waikiki without hesitation.

The Tiki bar downstairs was awesome. Right across from the beach so great location. I agree with other posters about the resort fee. For the cost I would have rather picked out my own daily breakfast (if we even got up early enough) and we used hot spots on our phones so we didn't need wifi. NOR did we need the ""included"" DvD rentals or unlimited play station. Resort fee with ""inclusions"" would have been good if we needed a baby sitter.

Across the street from the hotel is beautiful Waikiki beach. The hotel includes a Subway and Wolfgang Puck Express. By the pool is the Tiki Restaurant and Bar which provides moderately priced food and nightly entertainment. The flow at the continental breakfast by the pool is much better organized than on previous visits.In my opinion there is not $18 value in the 'resort fee'. While it is nice to have wi-fi in our room it can be very slow at times and only works within a few feet from the router (not even on the lanai!).Free DVD rentals are included but really not much interest to us as we would much rather be out and about. The breakfast used to be part of the basic room rate. Certainly not worth $180 in our case.

The hotel claimed the rooms had been updated, that must have been several years ago. If contractors updated my house like this, I would be sick to my stomach. While we were there we switched rooms. Our first room was suppose to be a full ocean view, we were on the 25th floor (top floor). To get the ocean view you had to step out on the very small balcony and lean over the rail to see the ocean. An accurate room description would be the diamond head, zoo view. The room was Very Small! We decided to pay an extra $90 per night for the suite, great view and double the size of the room. We had a king bed with a pull out couch for teenage boys. The room had a great ocean view with 2 balconies. Our bathroom was handicap accessible. Needless to say there was a lot of rust on the shower wall, also our shower curtain had mold on it. On the second night we noticed that the pull out couch had a very soiled mattress! They changed the mattress but then it didn't fit the bed. So the next night we decided to move back to a small room with double beds. The free breakfast in the morning was the best! The location of the hotel was at the end of Waikiki so it wasn't as crowded. The con about that was that when you crossed the street to go to the beach, it was more of the public beach so you saw a lot of homeless people. Most of the homeless people do not bother you, but some of them yell profanities or insults. Homeless population is really bad in Honolulu. You will notice it more at this end not so much at the more expensive hotel end. I will not stay at this hotel again. I will look for a hotel that is on the beach not across the street from a beach.

Surprised that it was fairly quiet inside the hotel as there is so much hustle and bustle in this area. I agree with others that an upper floor is probably quieter. They have a secure elevator system which is important because there is such open access from the street. Lots of people. Everything you need for dining, entertainment, shopping is within walking distance. The ""free"" breakfast is included in the resort fee, but resort fees seem to be the norm in Hawaii.

Also compare how thing have decline through the years and that they are better option at Waikiki for accommodations. Our trip was for a surprise birthday trip for my husband for 3 days and with the intention of extending our stay one more day on our ""favorite"" hotel. We checked in around 1030pm-11pm and the front desk was quiet with two staff member. The young gentlemen help us check in and was quick at talking too! Maybe he was on a hurry to send us off! Room booked and paid for was Ocean View and put in a request if it could be accommodated ( highest room & one bed). Finally our room was #2311 and since we have stayed here before we knew it was one of the highest floor. Once we got there come to find out that this room are the rooms that are right behind the elevators... You know, up and down noises? Swishhhh up swishhhh down! Oh yeah and the beeping doing of the elevators. If your a light sleeper or after a 5-14 hr trip this is not what you need. The room had NO beach coolers and the view was amazing of Waikiki! Called the front dest to see if they could relocate the room or even downgrade to room to Partial Ocean View Room but after being on hold with the guy and him explaining that they are booked full no spare room and that he couldn't switch my room! Then he put me on hold to speak to the manager to see what he could do. After 3 minutes on the phone they told me to go downstairs and that they will relocate us to the Aloha Suite... I guess there was rooms available after all!!! Formally known as the Junior Suites now they switched it to Aloha Suites, mind that i have stayed a few times paying for that room and are quiet nice! We were impressed of the new room but it seem likes a quick reaction so something wasn't right! Went to pick up our new keys (heaven forbid you loose them cause it will cost you $2 per key! Before they would tell you take them as souvenirs not that I want them!). So our new room is now #928. So if you get the numeration the first digits are the floor number and the last 2 are the location of the room. Even numbers have Diamond Head and Odd have the Waikiki view. Also I just went from good view to a huge downgrade! But keep in mind is a suite so when we went in it was a total disappointment and after having to speak to the Front Desk earlier and this is what I ended up with it seem like I wanted to switch my countdown on this getaway trip to fast speed to get out of here!!! Tip: if your room number ends on #11 your very close to elevators! I took pictures of the condition on the room #928 and will post. The bathroom was in terrible condition, tiles of different color, toilet with mildew and licking water when you flush, bathtub yellow stain on wall, walls patch up, wall edges pain coming off, tissue holder broken, desk plug not working and balcony sliding door didn't close. Yes the flat screen tv is nice but the options of tv channels aren't many and quality isn't that great, no HD tv here. We were tired so off to shower and bed but... Turn on the water and it seem like no one has used that bathroom cause the water that first came out was dirty brown... Let it run for a little and off to bed. I didn't bother to look for bed bugs cause heaven forbid I would find any! Next day, bright and early ready for their free breakfast! FRIENDLY STAFF!!! Mind that I have stayed here for the past 6 years and I thought that even with the cross over from ResortQuest to Aston might not make any difference in the quality, it sure has now! Yes the lines are long and it can be a little bothersome for some of the people who just jump in or overly excited people but the food has change. Coffee, 4 options of plain cereals, yogurt, doughnuts, danish and pastries, mini muffin, mini bagels, some sort of soup ( catering to the Asian crowd), juice, milk, hot cocoa, and hot tea. Now they used to offer warm sandwich, French toast stick and burrito before for ""Free"" cause it was included in your final bill for amenities. Now the option for a warm meal can cause $4 additional on top of an amenities fee. You can save money by going to another hotel and buy breakfast at other places with options. The ""free breakfast "" has gone down hill from what it use to but again I'm stuck in this hotel for the next day. Music and hula dancer still there which is very nice Aloha touch and very slow wifi available at pool or you can use their business center for a few dollars and printing is extra. On check out day and i see the bill I see the prices have gone up on taxes but most importantly the amenities fee. Total extra on top of the room cost is $49.57. There's $18 that goes to amenities fee which includes, newspaper, ""breakfast"", gym, movie/games rental which includes a lot of Asian movies (at the time I looked at it) and who knows what else they'll like to call amenities fee. With $18 I could have ate at Egg&Thing or somewhere, I'm on vacation so i don't need news paper, movies are okay on a rainy day if yonrather stay indoor but Tip: Subway does offer a $3 breakfast combo make it your way downstairs but I don't know how long the promotion goes for... Didn't try it cause I felt Aston already took my money and run with it. Since we were so disappointed we walked less than a block towards the Hyatt Place and ask them about their price and availability. Guess what? We were sold and our extra night went with the Hyatt Place (room and experience will be posted shortly- Amazing! And amenities fee plus taxes total $30.58 with real breakfast! Free wifi in your room, free computer and free printer) So since we couldn't drag our bags around Waikiki we used the bell/bag storage service at the Aston waikiki beach hotel. When we went to pick up our bags, to our surprise the young guy told my husband to come with him, showed him to the room, open the door and had my husband grab his own bag out the door. YES! What a liability to have anyone go into the room with other customer bag. Well it was $3 in tip we saved! Remember we have stayed here before and even recommended and booked additional room in the past cause we thought it was a good hotel to recommend. We even got a postcard in our room from the ""manager"" appreciating my business and this time was the worst. REMEMBER, the staff is very friendly and full of Aloha at this hotel. At the time I booked this room I had options from Hilton Village for $175 and other hotels but I went with the only hotel I have stayed and thought I knew but this one was the last time will book them. Some one else got my business and glad I did! I seen reviews and how the Aston management team over and over try to justify the amenities fee to be justifiable but I took simple math elementary school and I think it's another way to nickel and dime during tough economy for struggling hotels.","Downey, California","PixieFairyDust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Downey, California</strong>",9,2.0

They have an office (we used Expedia) to help with all excursions and every excursion was top-notch and no problems to get to or come back from. The hotel has a Tiki restaurant which was some of the best food we ate. We felt like we were on a 4 or 5 star restaurant. There is an awesome Hawaiian DJ and a wonderful dancer for your entertainment while you eat breakfast. They also provide a small breakfast bag in case you want to take your breakfast with you which is sooooo cool. This was one of our coolest vacations.

We were able to book a room at the last minute which was nice. We were on the eastern side of the building on the 25th floor with a great view of the beach, Diamondhead and the zoo. The check in was quick and easy. The few downsides to this hotel are 1st $27 valet only parking fee, and of course they want a tip to retreive your car. At the Aston Beachside 10 days earlier I only paid $22, and they use the same garage. a few hundred feet down the street. 2nd Is their AMMENITY FEE ?? This is the first time in 30 years of traveling I have ever been charged an ammentiyty fee. Basically they charge you $18.00 plus $ 3.00 tax ( ON A DAILY BASIS ) to have the continental breakfast, and use the high speed interent and DVD rentals. The breakfast consist of cold cereal, yogurt,pastries, and coffee But hey for another additional fee of $2 you can get french toast, or for $5 you can get an omlet. Since we were just a one night stay, We got 2 cups of week coffee and cold cereal for the $ 18.00. I think they should just add the $20.00 to the advertised room rate rather than the bait and switch tactic that they are using. If you book through Travelocity of other online travel sites these ammenity fees are not told to you. So you would need to add $21.00 a day to the cost of your room. If you have a rental car you can add $ 48.00 to your daily room expense.

We booked into the Aston Waikiki Beach which is located nearer the Zoo end of Kalakaua Ave. It fronts onto Kalakaua and many rooms have a beach view. Upon arriving, we had to take an elevator to the third floor where the registration was located. After getting squared away, we were given our room keys (credit card type) and told to use the elevators to get to our floor. Here was the beginning of our adventure. You have to swipe an area of the elevator key. When it rings, then you can enter your floor number. Finding the right place to swipe took getting used to and everyone seemed to be having the same issue. Once we got used to it (I think it took two days), we were okay. Then we got to our room. Here we had to insert our key into a slot and pull it our. Some times it took over a dozen swipes. We even had our keys re-keyed and still had the same problem. After three days we found out that you had to jam the key right back in the slot before pulling it our at medium speed.Our room was quite small. This hotel was built in the sixties and had been renovated. The decor had an odd retro feel about it and the two double beds really made the room close in on us. There was a small patio that had one chair and one small foot stool... that's it. The bathroom was just okay in size, with a shower/bathtub combo, sink and toilet... pretty standard hotel fare. Besides the beds, there was a small table and two chairs, a chest of drawers,.a flat screen tv and a Playstation where you could play DVDs as well as games. There was also a small closet that held a floor safe. Along with our room costs,. there was an additional $18 a day for 'amenities' which included the use of the safe, wireless internet, and free breakfasts (a la continental style). Although we used the hotel room mainly for sleeping, it would have been nice to have had a little more room. The morning breakfasts were okay. They consisted of juices, cereals, yogurts, pastries, miso soup, coffees, milk and fresh fruit. This is basically all you needed to get your day going. The views were good from our 18th floor room and the noise was acceptable. All in all, I think this was an okay place to stay. If you were on a budget, it would seem good. For a few more bucks, you could get a better room across the street at the Marriott. But for four nights, we felt it was accdeptable.","Kelowna, Canada","thelamster</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kelowna, Canada</strong>",35,3.0

It was sold to us as a 4 star when it's really a 3. It's not terrible but it has its problems. We got annoyed by the extra $18 daily fee to access things that should have been included in the tariff, wifi, beach towel hire and breakfast. And speaking of breakfast, it's laughable. The hotel cheats by giving you a plastic carry case to go down to the pool area to collect a basic array of foods. Yet many people sit and eat on the pool furniture while a singer and a hula dancer 'entertain' them. Hula was the last thing I wanted to hear at 7am as a watched the wind blow the breakfast detritus into the pool. It was as grim as I imagine a UK holiday camp to be.

Decent breakfast included; rooms have insulated bags so you can take your food and eat it wherever--we ate on the beach. Minuses: Rooms are old. The front and side of the hotel are noisy, with the tiki bar and the busy streets and the side and front. We were assured our room was quiet and had an ocean view. It was neither--it was right above the bar and with a sliver of ocean from the walk-out deck. Plus, the hallway was not even carpeted all the way to our room--the carpet stopped a few doors before us. We easily got the room changed to the other side, which had a view of Diamond Head and of the ocean, plus it was quieter. It did not have a walk-out deck, though. The staff was good. I would not stay here again, though, until they update. Plus Waikiki Beach itself is incredibly touristy and packed with people.","Des Moines, Iowa","spanishpeeks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Des Moines, Iowa</strong>",165,3.0

We previously spent 5 nights at the Embassy Suites and loved it. While the Aston was cheaper, the room was clean and the beds and pillows very comfortable so it served our purpose. The bathroom could easily have done with a major makeover as it was very outdated. The hotel promotes ""Breakfast on the Beach"" by providing each room with a cooler bag to place breakfast items in and then guests can either sit by the pool and eat breakfast or walk across the road to the beach. While this sounds like it could work, it fails abysmally! There are no tables set up for guests to sit down and enjoy breakfast, instead guests are made to line up to collect breakfast in styrofoam cups and bowls and then try and find a lounge chair around the pool to eat - it was the worst breakfast experience I have ever had in a hotel!! The morning we had breakfast was very crowded - we ended up having to sit on a small concrete wall and literally try and eat our breakfast before the birds grabbed it first. The amount of wastage is incredible - foam cups and bowls and plastic cutlery everywhere - surely a hotel of this calibre could do a whole lot better than this. A hot breakfast was an extra cost, after we were made to pay an amenity fee on top of our room rate of $18 to cover Breakfast on the Beach and internet access (which is non-existent). A woeful experience. This hotel is definitely not on my list for a return trip to Oahu.","Sydney, Australia","Ingrid0309</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",48,3.0

Once I went to pick up some 'complimentary beach towels' and the guy told me 'these are fresh from the laundry'... I didn't know why he said that, I didn't ask anything but when I tried to dry myself and my daughter in those I found lots of yellow stains and an awful smell of cheese. It was disgusting and the worst was that it started to rain (like it does in February in Honolulu) and my daughter was shivering so I had to wrap her in that.. And of course there was no one minding the towel kiosk.The cleaning lady was very sweet, very friendly and smily but she managed to not clean the room in 4 out of seven days we stayed there. She apologized but why do I have to beg her to do her job?Breakfast was another let down. First of all, you have to fight to find a chair to seat down. it's all happening at the swimming pool area which obviously hasn't been prepared for this type of event. Everything is pre-packed in tons and tons of paper and plastic. They were constantly emptying massive rubbish bins just to get them filled up again in a matter of minutes. So wasteful, the worst I've ever seen. Fresh fruit was ok, the greasy pastries were from some discount store, not really nice. Coffee didn't even taste like coffee, in fact, I'm not sure what that was. And I know dairy is expensive in Hawaii (it's all imported) but they watered the milk too much, yuck!Show at the swimming pool was really great. Unappreciated by a bunch of rude guests stuffing their already stuffed faces with cheap food, too busy with their fatty doughnuts to applaud the two great artists they had in front of them. The rooms looked too DIY and outdated. Balls of fluff and dirt under the beds and behind the furniture. Good tv but poor signal. I asked twice for someone to have a look but no one came.

You just need to cross a road and you can have your feet wet by the Waikiki beach.The DVD dispensing machine was a great excuse not to sleep along with the Playstation 3 inside the room.Breakfast was adequate. You are provided with a bag where you can stash the bread, yogurt, fruits, cereals and soup (and cups of coffee, juice, milk or tea) from the breakfast area. You can bring your bag to the beach, swimming pool or back to your room (an innovative idea as there was not much seats to accommodate the guests). You can only line up for breakfast picking once, it think. My breakfast the next day at the hotel was made more challenging with the cold rain (not much shelter was available)There is no complimentary transfer from honolulu airport to the hotel. I booked an airport shuttleI am not sure if I will book this hotel again if my travel leads me back to Honolulu, but I will surely book this hotel and this view if my family comes with me and I want to show them the great view. Otherwise I will book to a hotel near the International Market and just walk to the beach (I think that would be more economical and the breakfast might be a better experience)At checkout I was informed that I can earn Hawaiin Airline Miles - this made me smile a bit.","Manila, Philippines","NinoDal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",50,3.0

We enjoyed our 2nd stay just as much as the 1st & would return to this hotel again if ever back in the area. For value & location this place can't be beat. Though they do charge a daily resort/amenity fee what you get is well worth it...daily newspaper, free sign out of beach towels & beach chairs, dvds/ps3 games, Breakfast on the Beach is still excellent! In recent reviews I've read people complain about the breakfast, we were here for 10 nites and only had positives: only one day was there a longish line, but it moved very quickly & we had our food within a few minutes. Huge selection of continential items; cold cereals, cut up fruit, lots of mufffins, & pastries, 8 types of juice, pop, hot choc, good selection of teas, instant oatmeal, great selection of yougurts, asian items, 2 flavoured coffees, plus reg. & decafe. If this didn't cover your needs there is the hot items station which has omelettes every day & either french toast or waffles to buy for $3-$5. Honestly great selection, always replentished quickly...my husband can't eat wheat, so every day for $5 he bought an omelette, & was more than satisfied with fruit, yougurt & juice, milk, coffee, etc...so for those who complain about the breakfast not sure what they are acustomed to but I would say its plentiful. Its called Breakfast on The Beach, for a reason...fill cooler bag provided & take to the beach!! Don't crowd around the pool & then complain not enough chairs!! We enjoyed breaky on the beach several times..great experience, as well as some days took breaky up stairs on room balcony enjoyed the awesome view as the Hawaiian singer/music floated up to our room. Its never over powering or too loud. A couple days when breakfast area was slow we did stay by the pool to watch the hula & singer. Thx Celeste the hula dancer, for even making a traditional bracelet for our daughter! The 2 ladies who keep breakfast running smooth are awesome & friendly...as are ALL the Aston staff. Even those you just pass in the halls! All of our requests, though few were met & handled in a pleasant postive way. I just can't comprehend the things people have complained about or given negative feedback about. House keeping does a great job, in the rooms & through out all the common areas & grounds. The only time we needed to contact housekeeping was one day our maid missed leaving a bath mat, quick call & we had one in 5 min. Plenty of clean towels everyday. Rooms made up by 3 or 3:30pm at latest...people must realize this is a popular, busy hotel...rooms being checked out must be clean 1st, so new guests can check in. They say each room is inspected after being made up...yup its true I saw 1st hand housekeeper, being called back to a room to re-touch some thing the ""inspector"" noticed!! In a previous reveiw some one complained there's a tiny sign in bathroom saying if you remove the soaps, its a $25 charge...hello that notice is reffering to the surfboard stand the soaps are on!! as in if you like it so much ask to buy one from housekeeping for $25, don't steal it from the room!!! Great selection of soaps & tolietries too! Much more than many hotels offer these days. One day we had an early tour, 5am pick up...while most guests slept, the staff were busy scrubbing down the comon areas, pool, lobbies, washrooms, etc. We spent most of our last day hanging out by the pool, etc...since we had checked out we had to use the pool area washrooms most of the day...these were cleaned numerous times through out day....when you have several hundred people using these common areas, there will be times when you hit it & its a bit of a mess, but the staff were on top of this all the time. Great staff!! Its an older hotel...as nearly all in Waikiki...but is well maintained, while we were there a portion of the lower street level lobby flooring was replaced within a day, with minimal disruption to guests. Also this lobby is one of the BEST waiting areas I have ever seen in a hotel...abundant space & seating for those waiting for cabs, tours, or their cars. Also the way its set-up you can see right out to the street, to where your tour bus will be stopping. The valet/bell desk were AWESOME, we never had to wait long for our car, they said just call down 10 minutes before you need the car & it was always ready when we needed. They reserved us a cab & made sure it was there for our return to the airport, stored our luggage after check out, hassle free! Tiki's has great food, great staff, great views/ atmosphere, great music every nite...it only ever went to about 11 or midnight at latest & if you close your black out drapes it blocks out the music well. Most nights they only played until 10. We were on 10th floor, over pool & noise was never an issue. This is a great hotel. It looks exactly like the pictures...yes even the pool...take a look at some of the other hotels in area & some of their pools are way smaller. Parking is a premium in all of Waikiki...ALL the hotels charge for parking..even self parking, which at some is very limited. We had family stay at another hotel 2 blocks from beach, block behind Int. Market Place...they paid about the same for way less hotel, no amenities, no breakfast, no beach front, no view & not nearly as nice of a property. Nearly all rooms on Waikiki are small compared to other cities. Our Ocean view room with 2 double beds, was fine space wise for myself, husband & teen daughter. For value, location, hotel features, amenities, helpful staff, & the price you pay the Aston Waikiki Beach is hard too beat. Its great for families & those on a moderate/mid level budget. About the only thing we noticed since our last visit in 2008, the red bed coverings/ shams aren't quite as vibrant as they were 5 yrs ago...washing does that! We found this room on 10th just as comfortable as previous room on 8th. Bathroom floor tile begining to show age, but not awful & otherwise clean. No peeling paint, overall clean room, clean bedding, furniture fine & in keeping with the ""hip retro"" theme of 50's 60's Hawaii, as done in the 2006 renovation. Lastly the tour desks are aweome...Peggy at Pleasant Holidays was exceptional...we had booked an inter island day tour with her 2 weeks before coming. She told us to call her back when we got confirmation email, should have came within a few minutes...when we didn't call & no email was coming Peggy called us back a few times until it all was sorted out (error in email address). So we were happy to meet Peggy in person & have her book further excursions for us while in hotel. If we ever visit Honolulu again (and we will!) we will stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach again,no hesitations!",Alberta,"m k</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alberta</strong>",6,4.0

Especially nice was Stephanie (the breakfast host), keeping the breakfast running smoothly every day, and actually remembering us after our first day (amazing in that we're just ordinary folks not making a fuss). That's the kind of thing that makes a hotel guest feel special, instead of just another tourist. The poolside entertainment at breakfast was also excellent, with the Hawaiian opera singing guitarist and hula dancer Celeste both genuinely happy to be entertaining us.The PS3 in the room is included in the resort fee, as are movies from a DVD kiosk in the lobby. Didn't use either but still a nice extra. The only downside to this place is the parking arrangement, valet only, for $27 a day.

It is also within walking distance of many great shops and restaurants. Rooms are updated and clean, although quite small but who stays in their room when you're in Hawaii? The free breakfast in the morning is a great perk and they always had live music and a hula dancer during breakfast. One issue is the lack of seating - the breakfast buffet is served at the pool and there just isn't enough seating for everyone.

I would say that the hotel looked exactly liked the pictures show, however . . . we reserved an oceanview standard room. It was very, very, very small. I was told that rooms with two beds come with full beds only. For the three of us (husband and 21 teenage son) it was very cramped. There wasn't much room to even walk around the beds to get out to the lania. The room we had in this hotel had a small lania with one chair. We would take a small chair from in the room out onto lanai when more than one of us wanted to enjoy the views. This was slightly inconvenient I thought. The view from the room however was breathtaking! See photo. Unfortunately when we first checked in, we had to request a room change because as I was sitting on one of the beds, I felt a bug crawling on my shoulder from the headboard of the bed. I caught it and was quite alarmed. See photo. I called down to the front desk and within minutes security and housekeeping were in my room asking me questions, telling me they were going to move us to another room, taking pictures of the bug and then recommended that we allow them to spray our luggage with a bug spray. They would bring our bags over (which we hadn't unpacked yet) to our new room after approximately 30 minutes. Which they did do. I was very nervous about spending the rest of the week in the hotel, but just tried to forget what happend and make the beset of it. The rest of thet stay went fine. We especially enjoyed the free morning continental breakfast which is buffet style. They even provide little plastic lunch bags they call ""Breakfast on the Beach"" bags that you can bring with you to fill up to your hearts content with food and then take it to the beach and ear or where ever you want to go. Something very cool is that during breakfast time, they have live music/hawaiian dancing going on poolside sort of like entertainment while you eat. The hotel offers free towels and beach chairs you can check out each day to easily take across the street to the beach. We even took them to Hunauma Bay with us one day. Another great feature is their free DVD rental kiosks in the lobby. Each room is equipped with a gaming system/DVD player so you can get up to two DVDS at a time from the lobby kiosk. The selection of movies wasn't bad either. We ate at the hotel restaurant which was good and they have live entertainment on certain nights. Although there were many FREE things the hotel offers, it really isn't FREE because each day you stay in the hotel you are charged a ""resort fee"" which covers Internet, DVD movies, Daily Breakfast Buffet and access to towel/chair use. Be mindful when booking this hotel as far as the daily rate you get. You will be spending more when you include the daily resort fee and mutiple taxes on top of the room rate. It can add up really fast and surprise you when you check out.Although I loved the location and all the conveniences the hotel offered, I felt the rooms were just too small for our taste. Although we do spend a lot of time outside, we don't want to feel cramped in our room either and for the price of the week long stay, I would have liked more space for our money.","Ann Arbor, Michigan","lisaviva</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ann Arbor, Michigan</strong>",39,3.0

It is amazing what little trivia things bother some people. The rooms might be a little small but we spent very little time in the room. We had an ocean view room which I highly recommend. We traveled in August. The rooms could use a fan, but you can open the sliders. We watched great sunsets and we had the beach right across the road from us. You can have the best of both worlds. Some complained that the beach across the street was not great because of the man made breaker wall which closed in the beach. Yes, you don't get the waves, but you have a very protected beach if you have young children, It was also easy to swim laps since there were not any waves. Beach was great. If you want the waves, just go 50 yards to the left of the pier and you can be surfing or body boarding just like the fancy hotels at the other end of the beach. The pier was also a good place to walk out on and watch surfers and jumpers off the pier. The continental breakfas was satisfying for my wife, daughter and me. Plenty of fruit, pastries, coffee and juices. I found the elevators to be fast and not as confusing as some have complained. The hotel is at a great location at the Diamond head end of Waikiki Beach. It is easy to get to the freeway and you don't have to go all the way through downtown like some of the other hotels. All of the bus lines turn right at this hotel so it is easy to catch a bus. The zoo is just a couple of blocks. When I booked, this hotel, it was half the cost of fancy ones that you don't spend much time in. The car rental shop is just 3 easy blocks away. Like most of Honolulu, it costs $20 a night to rent a car but the hotel has great valet parking. We only rented for two days because most of everything else had great bus service or was within walking distance. We will book here again on the next trip.

The only thing I would say to do is request a room on a higher floor because breakfast is served around the pool every morning where they also have live music and a hula dancer. It can get a little loud early in the morning. However, what better way to wake up than to beautiful sunshine and peaceful Hawaiin music. The hotel offers free videos for rent, which is great after a long day of hiking, swimming and sight seeing. The location is perfect if you have a rental car.

All you had to do was cross the street and you were at the beach!I've read several complaints about the breakfast, but I think the problem maybe was expectations... if you are looking for a full hot breakfast, go out for one. If looking for a quick, but yummy breakfast the hotel provided that. We ate there probably 6-7 of our mornings there and found no issues. Very short lines, food was always stocked and available, the cooler was nice to transport food over to the beach or to our room. Liked the tropical yogurt flavors and the donuts were amazing! C'mon we were on vacation! :)We had no issues with the elevators either although I had read several complaints about those too. To go up you had to swipe your room card and then it would tell you what elevator to get on. Never did have to wait long.Other positives were beach towels and chairs available for check out. Three DVD rental machines (Free... kind of... see resort fee commentary). Daily newspaper. In-room safe. Internet is available in the room, but currently not wi-fi. My main complaint was the daily resort fee. Ours was $10/day when we booked thru Priceline. Current signs stated it was $18/day.This is supposedly to cover breakfast, safe, DVD rental, internet. Those sorts of things... now unless this is actually optional (we were never asked if we wanted these things or were given an opportunity to turn it down), why isn't it just added into room cost? Why separate charges? Just seems like they are really nickel and diming us. We were aware of it and it was a minor annoyance, but at $18/day it could be quite an unfortunate surprise at check out if you weren't prepared for it.Overall we were very happy with the service and location.

Very out-dated, unimpressive reception/pool area. Staff were very friendly even when a member of our party got a bit cranky. Elevators require a swipe of your room key, great for security, bad for convenience, especially when carrying food or coming from the pool. Elevators were jammed with people so often that they were over-loaded and would not move until people got off. The room appeared what I would describe as ""Tiki-tacky"", with odd color choices and beat-up furniture/out-dated carpeting. I am very picky about cleanliness and check for dirt where others wouldn't look, so I was was pleased to find the room to be especially clean. However, the bath tiles are beat up and grout/caulk looks discolored/dirty. Due to a goof-up on the part of the travel agent, we got a pool-side room (instead of the ocean-view we asked for). That meant we had to listen to crappy music pounding until 11 PM from the bar next to the pool and we had to listen to the Hawaiian ballad singer singing the same songs every morning 7A-9A. The Hula dancer was hot, so I didn't mind that much.The one really great thing about this place was the food and service at the Tiki Lounge restaurant and bar. Great menu with unique items.

I had the very top right corner room (street side) and for that I got a marvelous view of the ocean and out of the front door a fantastic look at diamond head. The breakfasts really helped with the food budget. (I'd freeze the yogurt for a frozen snack later that day complements of the mini fridge/freezer.I enjoyed the Asian influence to the breakfasts with kimchi, pickled seaweed, rice and miso soup. Couple of complaints might include no coffee pot so I couldn't brew up my favorite AM coffee and no microwave to further stretch my food budget. I hope management reads this post because I fell in love with their hair conditioner and those mini donuts that look like chocolate but when you bite into them, they are purple inside and the most tender delicious doughnut I've ever had. I hope they can help me find a similar doughnut and more importantly the hair conditioner. Oh also, I extended my stay and they put me in another room with the even smaller small balcony that pigeons are discouraged to land on unless they have a few flight hours under their beaks.

Since we were only staying one night I wanted something reasonably priced. Wow, is that hard to find on Waikiki. I chose this hotel cause the price was cheaper than many other hotels, and it was directly across the road from the beach. It is located on the end of Waikiki beach near the zoo. I actually liked the location, as it was across the road from the less busier sections of the beach. The room was small but wouldn't want to share it with more than one person. I really enjoyed the lanai, which faced the ocean. We stayed on a Sunday night the noise of the band playing at Tiki's was very loud, but thankfully they didn't play late.There were lots of casual places to eat nearby, I really enjoyed Wolf Gang Puck express, and Cold Stone Creamery. Nothing fancy here if that is what your looking for.Only one major complaint, if you wanted to use internet in your room, you had to have a cord to plug it to your computer.

This trip we decided to stay closer to Diamond-Head. We also enjoy many nice boutique hotels in NY so we decided to try one in Waikiki. I agree with the reviews about the view, but can't agree with the review of the Aston. The rooms are so small we had to set our chairs on our ocean view balcony to have room for our suitcases. Trust me, rooms in NY are small too and cost more, but you wont see such neglected hotels in NY as this one.The rooms look very tired paint has been slapped on the walls and are peeling off. No pillowcases on the pillows. The bathroom walls are filthy. The ceramic floors in the bathroom are the original flooring which needs to be updated. I'm sure it wouldn't cost that much to update the bathroom because literally only one small person can fit into the room. I'm 5'7"" 130lbs and my husband is a lean 185 lbs and we both cannot fit in the bathroom together! When the room reaches its temperature and the AC fan kicks off, you can smell the exhaust from the buses and other vehicles on the street below. We are on the 16th floor so my guess is it's coming up from the HVAC system that sets next to the street. Breakfast, forget about it! We were up at 730 huge huge line! And check in well that's another story. Pool lacks chairs and the chairs that are there are at a premium! This hotel needs a much needed face lift!

It was on the 5th level, (the pool was on the 3rd level) and they had a guy singing below our window every morning from 7am. Also, breakfast was in this area and everyone congregated around our window from 6:30 (when breakfast started). The DVD player didnt play the DVD's suppliedWhen we arrived we were told that there was an amenities tax for daily services in the hotel. This wasn’t stated on the price. It wasn’t much but it would have been nice to know if this was included in the price of the room. ($18 a day). The restaurant downstairs played music late at night and again this noise travelled up to our room. The décor was a bit outdated. Our room was dirty and was never really cleaned, although we did get our bed made up. The staff were fine, but because of the huge numbers of people in the hotel and the limited staff, they were always rushed and didn’t really have time for anything. The pool is not hit by the sun until late evening so it is essentially not useable, and there was some painting work being done also which meant it couldn’t really be used anyways.

All things considered it was a nice room for the price considering other beachside hotels prices.

There is an open air lobby with a front desk that overlooks the swimming pool and deck chairs which is located on the 2nd floor. There are ample towels available in the pool area, and you can walk down 1 flight of stairs, cross the street, and you are on Waikiki Beach ! Great location, as it is located on the southern part of waikiki beach. Walking distance to Queen's beach, right around the corner from Hula's club, and you can walk to the aquarium and the less busy Queen's beach (the gay area). Check in was friendly and effortless. The young gentleman gave us 3 hotel keys and had us check out each room to see which view and layout we liked the most. I really liked having a choice, and after we chose a room, we just let him know which one we picked and it was all set up for us.The hotel floors are part indoors and part open air, so there was no air conditioning in the hotel hallways. Room was nice with bright vivid colors, and the partial ocean view was adequate with step-off balcony. There really is no need to oceanfront room since the property is literally right across the street from the beach. Literally. Breakfast on the beach was a nice touch. You are provided a small cooler/tote bag and you bring it downstairs with you and there was a nice selection of cereals, haupia (coconut) pudding, orange and guava juice, miso soup (for the japanese tourists), rice, hash browns, and mini cinnamon rolls. This did not get boring, and I loved it. Some days I had my spouse go down and bring breakfast back up to the room, and any leftover such as yogurt we just put in our hotel refrigerator in case we wanted a late night snack. Overall the property is very tall. there isn't much room to spread out, and so everything just goes upwards. There was valet parking on the main floor, and front desk is located on 2nd floor and the front desk area shares space with the swimming pool. There was also a small store that sold sundries, but with the abundance of ABC stores on waikiki I don't see why this was completely necessary to have a convenience store. We walked a block to the pacific beach hotel and had their buffet dinner, where they have a huge aquarium in the center of the restaurant and this was delightful. The location of the hotel is in a quieter area of waikiki, but you can still walk to the International Marketplace and the busier side of Waikiki, but we preferred this quieter area. I would definitely stay here again without hesitation if I was on a budget, but next trip to waikiki I am thinking of trying one of the higher end resorts just to try something different.","Sacramento, California","RGb747</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, California</strong>",62,4.0

I had heard great reviews of their oceanfront select rooms hence decided to pay the premium .. oceanfront rooms are the most expensive in waikiki and it really does not make financial sense to pay such a big premium for it especially if you are not going to be spending that much time in the room .. since we were celebrating a special occasion we went for the splurge this time around .. we were booked on the 19th floor with a great panoramic view of the waikiki beach strip. I personally think the best view is from the sheraton hotel but that was way out of our budget range.. the room itself was quite spacious .. my only quibble was that the lanai was too close to our neighbors which compromises privacy .. We also found free parking on monserrat ave next to the zoo although it was a bit of a walk at times depending on how far our car was parked .. they charge $18 for resort fee which includes breakfast on the beach (not bad) and wired internet in the room (no, they don't have wifi yet :)) .. their parking is ridiculously expensive hence we decided to skip it in favor of bit of inconvenience to have access to our car .. also their is no coffee maker in the room but luckily starbucks is just around the corner so we got our caffeine fix in the morning w/o any problems .. When we checked in we were a little inconvenienced carrying our luggage up the escalator to the hotel reception area .. their elevator system is a bit of an overkill where you punch in the floor first and then an elevator gets assigned to you .. overall a very clean property right on the beach with great views from oceanfront select rooms .. definitely a winner from a price point if views are important to you !!!",Seattle,"travelmusings</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle</strong>",36,4.0

Be sure you investigate the little ""extras"" that get charged...$30 a day for parking and $20 a day resort fee with taxes. For a six night stay this added almost $300 to our stay. The rooms were nice and clean and the bed and bedding was excellent. The room was small, but we did not spend much time there. We paid extra for a ocean view which was great but the small lanai only had one chair so we moved one out from the room. Breakfast was adequate, cereal, tropical yogurt, lots of pastries and rolls, coffee, juices, and delicious fruit each day. If you wanted, you could order an omelet for $5 or waffles for $4. There is a Hawaiian singer and hula dancer to welcome you each morning, but we could hear it on the 20th floor, so I can only imagine what it was like for the rooms closest to the pool. Seating is dicey, but if we could not get a seat it was a short wait for one to come available or we took the food to the room. The small coolers were a bonus. I do not understand the problems with the elevators...to get down to the main floor you hit the star key and you did not need your room key for this, but you did need it to get back upstairs. All you had to do was scan the card and choose the floor and the system told you which elevator would take you there. Very efficient with a minimum wait time. The location is great if you enjoy the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. There is a wonderful beach right across a busy street, which means you get a lot of street noise, but that is to be expected. There are many ABC stores all around and numerous places to eat. The International Marketplace is very close with shopping and food. The zoo is right around the corner. At night, the restaurant ""Tiki's"" plays loud music until late in the evening so beware. The valet is very efficient, we usually did not have to wait more than a few minutes for the jeep, and it was great that we could check out beach chairs and towels to take with us.

We are glad we didn't! The package guaranteed a partial-ocean view room and for whatever reason we ended up on the 14th floor in an ocean-view room with full sweeping view of Waikiki. Our deck chair and its foot rest became a viewing stand from which we ate breakfasts, dinners (take out is nearby) and sipped morning Kona coffee (served at the hotel buffet) and sunset wine.This 645-room hotel is one of Waikiki's older properties. It underwent renovations in 2002 and again in 2006. Some of the common areas, such as the decking around the pool, as mentioned by others, is in need of replacement. Our room with two double beds didn't have a lot of extra space but it was decked out in bright Hawaii colors, the sheets were as luxurious as those we've had at higher end properties, the carpet new and of bamboo design and the towels were thick. The room was very clean; the maids were there every morning, bright and early.The hotel also has some nice touches. IWe were provided two cotton kimono robes and newspapers were available every morning at the elevators on each floor. We are puzzled by some of the complaints we read in earlier reviews of the food provided each morning. The whole concept is to serve breakfast on/in disposable flatware so that you can put it in the insulated bag (a gift from the hotel to keep) and take it, along with hotel-provided beach chairs and towels to the beach just across the street - the hotel's Breakfast on the Beach program. Most guests seemed to want to cluster themselves around the pool however and for that reason hotel management told us they have ordered more tables and chairs to accomodate the morning diners. The food selection included yogurt, cereals, miso soup, rice cakes, fresh pastries, and fresh fruit. Hot items were available for a nominal cost. Kona coffee as well as two additional special blends were also available.The only 'negatives' we would note were: the lack of wi-fi in the guest rooms (supposed to be installed in February 2013), and, a frustrating room key lock system that required several tries before the door opened. The elevator required the room key to be swiped both at the lobby level and on the floor before it would appear. (If you locked your key in your room you would have been unable to take the elevator to the lobby to get another one).While others seemed to have negative check-in experiences, we had five people manning the check in computers when we arrived; we stood in line for less than 20 minutes and our wait for our room wasn't more than another 20 (our flight was early - we were at at the hotel before the 3 p.m. check-in). All the staff members we encountered from check in to check out were friendly and efficient.The location was perfect: across from the famed beach, within a couple of blocks of high end shopping at the Royal Hawaiian shopping center, a block from the Honolulu Zoo and just a bit further to Queen Kapiolani Park and the Aquarium. Bus stops for buses going into Honolulu or away from it were within a block of the hotel. A Starbucks next door provided the free internet access we needed and for those with a sweet tooth, Coldstone Creamery was off the lobby. Tourism is on the upswing in Waikiki and so are the hotel prices. We found this hotel to be well worth what we paid for it and wouldn't hesitate to buy another package from Costco or to make a return visit here.","Agios Nikolaos, Greece","The_Travelnwrite</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Agios Nikolaos, Greece</strong>",65,4.0

It has changed ownership since 2008 when I last stayed, but it is basically the same. The location is the best part of this hotel! Ocean front is a must! Get the select rooms if possible, the views are spectacular. The swimming lagoon is great for those who are not strong swimmers & it is usually not too crowded. There are also many more corals and fish by the wall than there was in 2008, so you can snorkle as well. Its not like snorkleing Hanauma Bay or anything, but it is nice to see some fish, etc...The breakfast line is long, even if you get there when it first starts, it gets very crowded fast! The food is more basic than it was previously. You only get 1 breakfast bag now, which is OK because the choices are more limited. There are some pastries, some fruits, yogurt, cereal & juices. They don't have eggs anymore, which i was disappointed in,but it is free, so..... If you want anything beyond pastries and fruits, you will have to go out, but there are lots of places close by. I found cheeseburger in paradise has a decent priced breakfast & the lines arent as long as others.The room itself isnt huge, but you dont need a big room with so much else to do! The balcony is by far the best part! Small, but it does the trick! The bathrooms are outdated however. They are kinda run down & need an upgrade. The floor was kinda dirty as were the walls. the sink & toilet were clean. Showers are old. The shower head actually started spraying everywhere uncontrollably when I first arrived. Maintenance had to come replace it. They also had to replace the light in the room which was making sparks at the base of the plug. They were nice tho & replaced everything that needed to be replaced. I would like to see the whole bathroom just remodeled though, it would really make a big difference for this hotel! The staff is all friendly. The only issue I had was the room key not being activated properly. Had to go back to the front desk 3 times which was a pain with luggage & super long check in lines. I saw a few other guests having the same issue with the same staff member. He was nice, but I think he just didnt know how to operate the key thing. Once I realized, I went to a different guy & he was able to give me a key that worked with no problem. The cleaning staff were all very very nice & friendly & made sure everything was re stocked in the bathroom; towels, rags, soaps, etc...Parking is another issue..while valet parking is nice, it is very expensive! It would be nicer to have a self parking option. They are pretty fast at getting your car when you call though. Only once had to wait more than 10 minutes. I could also do without the resort fee, I think they should apply that toward the price of parking, as most other Aston hotels include free parking or list free parking as an ammenity included in the resort fee. The check out was nice being able to just drop the room key in a box in the lobby and not have to wait in a line!

The breakfast time was funny for the first time with their BOB (bring your own breakfast) basket but the next times was kind of stressing experience, perhaps if they open the TIKI restaurant for those who would like to have a seat and a nice talk at morning will be more relaxing. Very well located, and the most - it is in Hawaii !!! Not a minimum chance to change Hawaii to any place in Mexico or even in Brazil - perhaps you will find hotels better in those places - but I dare you to find other hotel in those places with a better cost benefit !!! NOT A SINGLE CHANCE. So If you are reading this review - I would say that this hotel is perfect if you would like to visit Hawaii !!! Stay at the hotel only to take a shower, appreciate the view (if you get the ocean view), get some sleep and grab a fast breakfast - otherwise there are other hotels 2-3 blocks from Aston that you will be glad to know (not so glad to pay).","São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil","Rodrigo X</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil</strong>",39,4.0

Its only a few dollars more for an ocean FRONT room and well worth the money. We stayed on the 14th floor which was perfect. The bathrooms were outdated, but I loved the Hawaiian feel of the room and the decor. The staff was very friendly. Tikis rooftop bar/restaurant was nice and ""happening"" at night. The drinks were great, the food was NOT my favorite. Fish Tacos on the lunch menu were yummy. Ran into Chuck Liddell in the lobby which was cool! Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again if I were to go back. Also, the location is perfect! On the 1st floor there is a Subway, ice cream shop, Wolfgang Pucks (which is gourmet to-go food, good prices). If you are anything like my husband and I, you will aPpreciate these places.

The breakfast times of 6:30-9 are not user friendly hours for vacationing guests, & thebofferings have really declined in the past 4 years.

We arrived at 2 a.m. (our back home time) so we were all very tired. First...this was not an accident of receiving a bad room. We were three couples and booked three rooms. All rooms were on different floors and same side of building. All three rooms were equally bad. They were dirty, wall paper very old and torn, air conditioner dirty, sliding doors allowed wind to whistle through like a freight train. We all booked partial ocean views. The view could only be seen when stepping onto the tiny balcony (no chair would fit) and leaning over, peering past your neighbours unit. Otherwise, the view was of roofs of other poor condition hotels The hotel says ""recently remodelled"". The photo of the red bedboard is the absolute only part of the room that was remodelled. EVERYTHING is very tired and old. I refused to walk barefoot in the room. The painted doors have probably 40 or more coats and resemble your fathers garage door to his 40's house or an entry to a cellar. The moment we entered the lobby booking in area we kind of knew we were in trouble. The pool deck has huge blister paint bubbles peeling from the deck floor. The breakfast included offers a food bank feel...and if raining there is no shelter with appropriated seating. If you have ever stayed in Mexico, at a resort, this would not even rate a 2 star. We left the next morning after scouting other hotels on the beach. We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for slightly LESS.

The location is awesome. The rooms while just a little outdated are roomy and clean. The beachfront rooms have a fantastic view. We stayed on the 18th floor and while we could hear the Tiki Bar it was just a hum and not loud enough to stop you from sleeping. That being said I don't think I'd want a room directly above it. The only things that needed improving are:1) I think the reception staff need to get upgraded check-in systems. Each check in took SO long. Clearly things could be more productive. (Or at least add more staff, even with 3 check-in staff I waited in line for over 40mins and there weren't many people ahead of me)2) I asked for an early check-in because my toddler desperately needed a nap (normal check-in is 3pm). We were sent away twice being told to check back later, but never given a timeframe as they didn't want to promise anything they could not deliver. In the end we checked in at 2:30pm. Barely early.

The maid we had was very sweet, but sometimes the room was not cleaned until 3 or 4pm... Our view was a partial ocean view. That was ok, but the balcony was so tiny, I couldn't even fit a chair out there to enjoy the little bit of ocean we could see. We were right across from another hotel( or the same hotel, not sure) and could see the people very clearly. ( Not always a pretty sight~ Im sure for them too). =) We were on the 17th floor, the big A/C units were pretty loud, drowned out the ocean. And for the first 3 days our AC did not work, neither did the AC in the other room our family was in. They fixed it quickly though. It was busy there but not too bad. Great location ~ right across from the beaches !! Loved that !!! The free breakfast was ok.Get there early, they did run out of food. It would have been nice to have some healthier choices. They had fresh fruit yogurt, cereal, plain mini bagels, mini muffins, and many different pastries and muffins ... too many if you ask me. Don't get me wrong, they were yummy.But maybe they could have changed it up a bit. They did have a waffle station, but it cost a little. Juice was good, Coffee was disappointing. I was told they serve Kona. Had to go to Starbucks and have Some Pikes Peek a few days. Luckily it was very close. The people at the information desk didn't know squat. Almost everything we asked them was wrong, maybe not completely wrong but it would have been nice to get some correct information. . They had free DVD movies and playstation games available.. The internet was down quit a bit.  The Tiki Bar/Restaurant was awesome !!!! Had the best food and great service. There were 14 of us at times and not one of us had a complaint about our meals! The Hawaii 5-0 Lava Flow is my favorite drink now. So good ! Delicious every time.The Wolf Gang Puck express restaurant was very good, but the bathroom in there was gross and dirty every time we went in.Good pizza,good salad & good breakfast pizza but they didn't serve Wolf Gang Puck coffee.. I was bummed about that. But all in all ~ We were in beautiful Hawaii !! Would I stay at the Aston again?? I guess so, but would definitely get a room with a view !!!!!!!!

The only thing I did not like about the location was the fact that the homeless hang out at this side of Waikiki.The hotel itself was fine, for the price you paid. I had requested a high floor and when we arrived at 10:00 p.m., they upgraded our room for no charge to accomodate my request, giving us a room on the 25th floor. The lanai was nice with room to sit and watch the sun go down into the ocean. The room and bathroom are small, but again, for the price, satisfactory. The elevator system is neat and works very well at getting you to your floor quickly. It was nice to have breakfast included in the price, as that saved us at least $30/day.The week that we were there, they had a Santa's workshop. The people that work at the Aston are wonderful. My 8 year old daughter enjoyed the morning workshop. Candace even came out looking for us at breakfast to make sure we knew about the workshop.

Very convenient.This had been advertised as providing a small carry pack for breakfast so that you could easily take it away. By the time we go there this had been replaced with flimsy cardboard trays that were difficult to manage. Breakfast itself was below acceptable. There was very little variety. Fruit was not ripe and was tasteless. Coffee wasn't worth the name. If you don't get there early you won't get a seat or may have to balance your flimsy cardboard tray on your lap. Breakfast probably wasn't a deal breaker but next time I would stay somewhere that didn't include it and eat out.

East end of Waikiki Beach, easy walking to zoo & aquarium, and of course, the beach, which was just across the street. Our room had a great view of Diamond Head and if you stuck your own head out far enough & craned it to the right, you could see the ocean. Starbucks is around the corner to your left, Seattle's Best is one block over to your right. Free to take with you to the beach: towels & beach chairs.Cons: Service. Maid service never showed until well into the afternoon, 330PM, then 4PM, then 430PM, and this even after complaining the first day. The concierge didn't seem to understand his job; when I asked for transportation to the airport, he gave me the phone number of a taxi service--he did not call & make the arrangement himself. And FYI, the EcoCab is a great company, with no thanks to the Aston Waikiki Beach Concierge, because that was not the number of the taxi service he gave me.

Basically, it was a weaselly add-on charge that you do not know of until you check in, too jet-lagged to complain & find another hotel. So-so: the breakfast. Yeah, sure it was 'free', and they supply you with a little case so you can take it with you to the beach, but the juices come out of a machine; the fruit is your standard American grocery store fruit (pineapple, cantaloupe, grapes, honeydew melon) that could be had anywhere--where was the papaya, the mango?; boxed cereals; mass-produced pastries; can't comment on the coffee & I missed the tea--it was by the juices instead of the coffee. That's the 'American' breakfast. For Asians, the food is on the other side: fish, rice, soup, that's what I remember. I didn't try any of this, though I meant to.

Even though the hotel isn't the flashest, in terms of location and price for a beach-front room, I always thought it couldn't be beaten. However, after this last trip, I'm afraid to say, we won't return - the prices have gone up but the room quality and service have dropped.We had booked our usual, high-floor, ocean-front room, but on check in, we were told we needed to pay extra for a high floor room - a policy which was brought in AFTER we had booked and paid. So we ended up with a lower floor room, which wasn't a huge problem but disappointing. Overall, customer service was pretty appalling, starting with check in and continuing throughout our trip. Staff seem disinterested in helping anyone and communication between staff members was terrible. We asked for a bottle opener to be delivered to our room and waited 90 minutes....we called downstairs to find out what was going on and someone told us they don't deliver items to rooms! So I then went downstairs to collect it and when I got there, was told someone was bringing it up! We had a free lunch included in our package and pre-booked it but it never turned up. We also had general issues with local attraction information provided by staff being inaccurate.In terms of the hotel itself, a revamp is well overdue. The beds are comfortable and rooms are relatively clean, but we had torn sheets and doona cover, broken lock on balcony door, peeling paint everywhere, and a hole in the wall in the bathroom. Bathrooms are very, very dated as is the furniture and carpet. The breakfast, as other reviewers have commented, is average at best. You also have to get down there relatively early, especially for holiday-makers (I think it's only between 6 and 9am and by 9am everything is pretty much gone). We actually skipped it a few days and ate elsewhere, which was a welcome change. Lulu's downstairs, past Subway and above the ABC store, was pretty good for breakfast.

We stayed on the 10th floor and we had wonderful unobstructed ocean views. The Lanai is very small, the bathroom is a 2 star at best, the decor is typical Hawaiian but the carpet in the rooms needs to be changed. The beds were very comfortable but we would not stay here again as we appreciate a higher standard. Due to a surprise Christmas present we booked this room with a couple hours of research and so we didn't have much time to look around. If you're on a budget and you don't really care about the room but still want something clean with a great view you will not be disappointed. The breakfast on the beach promo is NOT worth booking the room for if you're thinking of the cost saving on breakfast. If you like kiwi yogurt, heavy stale pastries, sugary cereals, and melons...then it's ok but if you want something healthy you'll end up buying breakfast anyways. We did not try the pool, we are ocean people. We did eat one night at the hotel restaurant, Tiki's bar and grill I think it's called. The food was good but not great, the service was good. Just a side note the hotel left a baby crib in our room the entire week...used it as storage space I believe...the youngest in our room was 18 years old. Also we booked online and were told there would be a welcome ""gift"" in our room...the only surprise was the crib. We would not recommend.The Royal Hawaiian Village hotel looked good as did the Hyatt and I believe they were similarly priced.","Beaumont, Canada","ernurseEdmonton</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beaumont, Canada</strong>",57,3.0

I was very concerned about the size of the rooms due to previous reviews I had read, however the room size was fine. It was not nearly as small and cramped as I feared. The view was wonderful. Two complaints, one of which the hotel cannot do anything about but light sleepers may want to consider. We were on the 23 rd floor and between the balcony and the fact that the front of the room was not buffered by a wall meant the sound of the wind was like a freight train. It was literally so loud it woke me up several times. Another complaint I think the hotel should address is the housekeeping departments efficiency. Three days in a row we left the room before 8 a.m., when we returned, after 2 p.m. Twice and after 3 p.m. Once, the room still had not been cleaned. As we wanted to catch a nap before dinner, we had to settle for asking for more towels. When we informed the front desk person of this on our 2nd to last night , although he did apologize, he didn't offer any compensation for our inconvenience. I also think the 10 dollar resort fee is ridiculous. It basically negates the free breakfast. We didn't use the safe, gym or movies and f.y.i, most hotels provide the first two at no charge.

The porch/Lanai is not very big but nice enough to step out and take in the view. The room was not as upscale but still above par. PS3's are included in the rooms and they offer free movies and video games at a kiosk in the lobby. The elevator system was cool, you have to swipe your room key and put in the floor your on and it tells you which elevator will take you there. The hotel is located right across the street from the beach. On one side of the beach there is a wall to withstand the crash of the strong current and waves, creating an area of ocean water that is very nice to swim and play in. The buffet breakfast is fantastic every morning. They provide a lunch bag in your room, which you can take with you to breakfast and stuff as much as you please then go enjoy the beach or pool area. Breakfast consists of a lot of pastries! However, there is also bagels, fresh fruit, miso soup, cereal, and other things to please your appetite. Everyone usually sits out by the pool where there is a musician/singer and hula dancer performing soft music as you enjoy your morning. The tiki restaurant at the hotel provides live music every night and the food is pretty good. The hotel is situated in a great spot.

Thankfully they try to get them out by 11pm, but then there's the clean up crew. Made for a loud evening.2) The continental breakfast is a bit chaotic, with everyone lining up to grab boat fulls of mediocre food, and then fighting to find a place to eat. 3) For a hotel where you can pay >$250/night, they actually charge you to a mandatory $10 fee to use the safe in your room, and other ""ammenities"" we didn't even want. 4) Our room was shabby. Our faucet not only leaked but if you lifted the tap wrong, you ended up with water everywhere. The headboard was falling off the wall. The carpets looked old.

We called upon arrival to see if the hotel would let us check in early at 12pm. The front desk clerk told us to come by in an hour at 1pm. We showed up at 1pm and were told we could not check in yet, but we could take care of all our check in with preregistration and the just pick up our key at 3pm. We were told we would be on the 21st floor and would have an ocean view with a King bed. We came back at 3pm thinking we had preregistered and just needed to pick up our key but were instead greeted with a line that stretched out of the front desk into the pool area. We tried to make the best of it and made friends with some other equally frustrated guests in line. We waited almost 90 minutes and at 4:20pm we reached a front desk person who told us we would be on the 18th floor with a partial ocean view and two double beds... this was understandably frustrating and we asked to speak to a manager. the clerk told us she would get a manager but after being gone for 10 minutes, came back out and simply told us the manager said they would not be able to move us into a king room with view until the next day. Wow, what a disappointment, we had just wasted the past 5-6 hours on check in only to have a lousy room and have to move again the next night to the room we should have gotten in the first place. The whole experience left such a bad taste in our mouth we struggled to find the positives to the hotel. But, the complimentary continental breakfast was very nice. Tiki's bar and grill is tasty and has great view, most of the staff are pleasant and helpful. I might actually consider going back here if I could be sure the checkin process would be better, but for the price, I will probably try someplace else next time and I really wouldn't recommend it when there are some many other places in Waikiki.",Great Northwest,"DeucesOfTheGreatNW</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Great Northwest</strong>",24,2.0

We only stayed at the Aston for a couple of nights after being in Maui for a week, at a really nice place, so maybe my expectations were too high? A lot of my judgement could also be based on the fact that Wakiki beach just wasn't the place for us. I said I ""wouldn't recommend this hotel to a friend"" but maybe it just wasn't the place for us. We were on our honeymoon and as I mentioned, spent a really relaxing week in Maui prior to, so the hustle of Wakiki beach just was a bit of a let down. I will say that the staff at the Aston was great and seemed eager to please. I've NEVER been the one to complain about a hotel room, let alone ask for a different room, but I'm embarrassed to say..we did! The first room was okay, just a little dirty and smelled bad and we just didn't want to spend the last two nights of our honeymoon there. The hotel was so great about upgrading us to a better room and even though I was embarrassed to ask or even complain, I felt like we were paying for way more than we were getting.

My review of this hotel also includes my criticism of Waikiki as a whole. We flew to Waikiki Beach from the Big Island. It was total culture shock. Why people spend thousands of dollars to travel to Hawaii for a super crowded, dirty, loud, traffic jammed beach area and strip of mega hotels I will not understand. I think it would be cheaper for the same experience in South Beach or Vegas. We are in our early 30's and love the night life as well as the next couple but this just seemed out of place if you're trying to retreat to Hawaii for a relaxing, romantic vaca.The Aston is located at almost the end of Waikiki Beach. I guess the hotel has had major upgrades. That being said...I would hate to have seen it before. There have been some cosmetic updates but the bathrooms in the rooms and other areas are still outdated and dirty. Our bathroom tile was dirty and cracked in the corners, ceilings had stains. We ended up having to change our room twice. Our first room was really tiny with only double beds. If one person was standing by the fridge the other would have to climb over the first bed to get past. On top of this the A/C was horrible. We called the front desk who sent an engineer who proceeded to clean out what looked like 20 years of compacted dirt off the coils. The air flow was better but not great. We were able to move to a room with a king bed the next day but the A/C was worse. The room would not cool down below 89 degrees! We called and finally spoke to a manager who upgraded us to a junior suite. At least the air was cool in this room and we had some space. We were assured that our luggage would be moved while we are out at dinner. Of course it wasn't upon our return and we had to call again. This hotel has a decent bar and resto on the 3rd floor. The only down fall is that the live music and club music can be heard all the way up to at least the 16th floor. So if you don't plan on being out partying all night, it's going to be hard to fall asleep over a nightclub.If you have to stay here you can make it work but I would not recommend this hotel or area for a relaxing Hawaii vacation.","Rochester, New York","ajanthony</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rochester, New York</strong>",39,3.0

No mini bar in rooms but with ABC shops on every corner and a fridge in the room there was no need for one. Absolute value for money. Location could not be better, full access to all amenities, shopping and resaurants with the beach right outside your door, what more could you want. In house tour desk very helpful,,,( thanks Ben, you helped make our trip one in a million). Lift system unique but easy to use and added to hotel security. Pool was a refreshing way to keep cool and the morning pool side entertainment was a nice touch. Free internet was restricted to lobby/pool area which was a little inconvenient. Pastries and doughnuts for breakfast became repetative/boring after a few days.. highly recommend MAC 24/7 at the Hilton if you are looking for a bacon and egg breakfast alternative. Our Anniversay was everything we wished for and more, many thanks to my family and Aston Waikki Beach Hotel.

I am a frequent resort traveler and this is NO RESORT. My group was able to get the fee waived because we booked prior to March 2012 when they implemented the fee, but we had to fight to do so. Found out they use to charge the fee for internet connection but decided to bundle it. Hotel was ok but needs some remodeling. I was very disappointed that there is no WiFi connection in any of the rooms. You can access internet via a cable modem but that is of no use to me when I am travelling with my iPad and not my laptop. Thank God I could add a hot spot connection to my cell phone while travelling. It was inconvenient to have to go to the lobby area to get the Aston WiFi connection. Sprint charged me $20 for a hot spot for a month usage. Breakfast on the Beach...free every morning....a serious misrepresentation and a total joke! I knew the beach was across the street...no problem but didn't know I had to fight the Japanese for a continental breakfast to put in a cooler bag, get a chair and towel from the hotel and go to the beach for breakfast. I thought it was going to be breakfast served on the beach each day. Waffles and omelets are available but for a fee. If you were later coming to breakfast rather than early, expect to find nothing left and even though it is still in the allotted breakfast time, I was told they would not be replenishing breakfast. Also expect to deal with the numerous homeless when you venture to the beach. I got breakfast only 2 days out of the 5 and was glad to give it to the homeless people hanging around.","Richmond, Virginia","NanaLovesLife</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Virginia</strong>",5,3.0

The rooms are of reasonable size, en suite, with clean bath tub & shower facility. Although most rooms have tiny balconies, they offer a narrow view of the beach from between buildings. But its simple enough to get out of the hotel, cross the road, and walk on to the beach.The public areas of the hotel tend to be crowded throughout the day. Thankfully they are located on the lowest 3 floors.The reception, swimming pool and outdoor eating area is on the 3rd floor, and usually has a fare share of children and accompanying adults sitting around the pool throughout the day.The Plus points:The best part of the stay was the breakfast, the price of which is included in the room rate. You are provided with a square thermal zip bag in which you can pack your breakfast from the buffet, and take it down to the beach or eat it in your room or anywhere else you like. It is the best way to beat the crowds at the buffet.The tour buses all stop at the hotel's side entrance for pick-up and drop offs. The tour desk offers excellent service and are most helpful even if you are just asking for information without making a booking through them.The minus points:The hotel's internet use service is very expensive.The lifts (they call them elevators in the US of A) need to be accessed only with the room key to be placed against the sensor, and thereafter, the floor number is required to be punched in. The alphabetical identity of the specific lift to be used by you is displayed on the screen, and you take that lift to the floor you want. Once inside the lift, the doors will open only on that floor, and should you wish to get out on another floor, you can only do so after you leave the lift and re-do the whole process of calling for a fresh lift. I found the whole thing a little confusing initially, but got used to it soon enough.The hotel's two restaurants don't look very inviting, and its very easy, and probably much cheaper, to step out of the hotel and go to the dozens of eating places tat abound the area.I recommend the hotel for what it offers, at the price it does .","Mumbai, India","Aney60</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mumbai, India</strong>",162,3.0

True, you are hardly in the room, but in the evening it would have been nice to have a soft armchair to sit in rather than on the bed or on the wicker chairs they squeezed in with a small round table. The balcony was very small and only held one chair. Watching the surfers in the morning from the balcony was fun. The ocean view we had was on the side of the building which actually faced another hotel. You could see the ocean from that angle. The hotel gives you a small cooler which you can fill to bring across the street to the beach. The hotel boasts ""breakfast on the beach"" which is a nice idea, however, the amount of homeless people living along the beach and the smell of urine near where you would sit and eat was quite disgusting. So - needless to say, we didn't eat on the beach. There were not many restaurants near the Aston but walking down about 8 blocks they were plentiful. On the plus side...the rate was reasonable and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom could have used an updating but it was clean. Would we stay there again?

When we went back right on 1:30 pm our room was ready for us and our bags where to be brought up to the room which they where with in 10 mins. The room was nice, not too small with excellent views.

As we were on our honeymoon the front desk gave us a cute hotel frame as a congratulation.. :) We only managed to make it down to the breakfast on one of the 10 day we were there, ( most of the time we were either out on tours or catching up on sleep). But that one day we did make it down to was small but provided us with everything we would want, and being able to take it back to our room was a great bonus. The Tiki Bar and Grill down stair on the pool level was a great place to eat and have a few drinks. Highly recommend a visit there while you stay at this hotel. The ideas of the lifts provided great security and was very easy to use. It may seem strange at first but with in one go you will be used to it. The tour desks located on the lobby level of this hotel where more then helpful and friendly.

We were very impressed with the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel. We arrived an hour before check in and they were able to get our room ready reasonably quickly. To our surprise, they upgraded us from a double bed ocean view room to an Aloha Suite on the 11th floor with a partial ocean view. It was nice to sit on the balcony at night, listen to the band and sip drinks while the kids watched movies that they rented from the lobby which was part of the $10 a day resort fee and well worth it. The breakfast was a bonus. Lots to choose from and a huge money saver. The staff was all friendly from the check in staff to the valet staff. We even met a nice lady at the Expedia counter who helped us rent a car for the day to drive to the North Shore. To our surprise, she was from Portland too!!My only real complaint was the homeless population at that end of Waikiki Beach. Once you get closer to the Surfrider and the Royal Hawaiian, there are far less homeless. However, they really congregate at the end of the strip where the Aston is located. Because of that, even though there was plenty of beach across from the hotel, we choose to walk down to the other end most days to get away from them.The elevators were simple to figure out and reassuring to have that kind of security. We also frequently saw security walking around the property, especially during the weekend. Tikis and Lulus are close and convenient for lunch however, Tiki's is a little overpriced. We absolutely loved Wolfgang Pucks. Great food. Great prices. Very, very convenient. This hotel really seems to do all they can to accomodate their guests. I have no complaints about the hotel itself, however, if we went to Waikiki again, we'd probably stay a little further away from the homeless.","Portland, Oregon","JessicaDPDX</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",67,4.0

The free breakfast really does safe you a lot and it was very strange but nice to see people dancing to the live music by the pool at breakfast. There is no resort fee either which is another plus.

Staff was friendly and accommodating. We liked the location a bit away from the most congested part of Waikiki Beach. The included breakfast saved us lots of money and was more than adequate despite the online sniping about it on TripAdvisor. Maybe because we were there in mid Sept. at a somewhat slow time, but we never saw the mad rush to get breakfast, that has been described. We originally got a room with 2 dbl beds and a tiny (standing room only) balcony on the 14th floor that faced another building and the back of Diamond Head, in addition to the partial ocean view (very partial). Since it wasn't a great room, I asked for an upgrade when we arrived and they said they didn't have anything. The next morning, I asked again and was offered a room across the hall with a larger balcony and ocean view, overlooking the pool. The only catch, they told us upfront, was it was right next to the elevator and they warned us about the constant noise from the elevators moving up and down (at least they don't 'ding' when the doors open). We took the room and found we quickly acclimated to the elevator noise (like wind blowing or ocean waves). It didn't bother us but I expect that it would bother many people, especially those who paid the full price for ocean view and wound up there. I also suspect that room goes empty at times because they don't want unhappy people. I appreciate that they told us about the noise upfront before we went to the trouble of switching rooms so we could make a fully informed decision. When we realized we left our cell phone charger behind in the first room (after >24 hrs) we contacted housekeeping who actually had it and quickly brought it to us! We also found that they give you free access to their public computers to check in for flights and print boarding passes which was another nice touch (I guess that's one of the percs your $10 daily amenity fee gives you besides the safe, newspaper,..). Bottom line, we would definitely stay there again!","Loch Raven, Maryland","Hokiemom07</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Loch Raven, Maryland</strong>",37,5.0

They were able to get us the king on the 2nd night. Rooms were clean and typical hotel sized rooms. The headboard was a pretty bright red floral pattern. Our balcony did have a partial ocean view which was nice. The hotel had a wonderful continental breakfast which we took advantage of. They even offered little cooler type bags in your room so one can fill it and take it over to the beach for breakfast on the beach. On top of the very nice breakfast they also made waffles or french toast (depending on the day) for sale at a very reasonable $3-$4. The hotel sits right across the street from beach so no long walk. I'm not a fan of the Waikiki area because of the homeless people that hang around at night and just the crowds but its a great starting point to get to other parts of the islands.

We stayed in one of the hotel's suites called the Kalakaua Suite on the 20th Floor. It has a separate bedroom (king size bed) with ensuite and in the main area of the suite another full bathroom plus full kitchen, laundry (washer and dryer), sofa-bed lounge and dining room. The room has 3 balconies all facing the ocean. We travelled with our 2 kids (aged 3 and 16 months) and utilised the separate bedroom for them so we could still eat, drink and stay up when they went to bed. It was BRILLIANT!The price we paid for a 14-night stay ended up being cheaper than paying for 2 interconnecting ocean front rooms, so the value was great. The view is AMAZING - we never got sick of it and after our 3rd trip to Waikiki we think it's probably one of the best there is. The part of Waikiki Beach across the road from the hotel is patrolled with life guards and is protected by a rock wall so it’s nice and calm for young kids.Our check in was great, we arrived very early in the morning (I think around 8am) and the hotel was able to get us into our room by 12noon and with 2 young kids we were very grateful after a long flight from Australia.We had read previously their lift system was hard to use - we found it very easy to use. You just swipe your room key and a letter comes up (ABDE or F) and you go to that lift and it takes you to your floor – easy!The suite itself had plenty of storage for your bags, shopping, food, kids beach gear, toys etc - there are cupboards everywhere so for an extended stay you certainly don't live in a mess like you would in a smaller hotel room and the laundry facilities allowed us to keep on top of our washing so there were never a large collection of dirty clothes piling up.The staff everywhere were very eager to help and ready to please. The breakfast on the beach was great but the cooler bag included in our room price wasn’t included any more so we just had to juggle our breakfast to a poolside table or back in our room. It’s included in the room so the ability to have some fresh fruit, cereal pastries, juice and a coffee each morning was nice. On a few mornings we even ordered an omelette which was only $5. Don’t expect reserved tables or full hot and cold breakfast – but expect a pretty well organized buffet to get you through the morning.The hotel also has a Subway, Cold Rock Ice Cream Shop, Wolfgang Puck and a convenience store all on street level, which is very helpful when heading back to the hotel at night for a late night snack.What the hotel offered in great staff, phenomenal view and perfect location it lacked in what I thought would be standard expectations for a hotel. This room was situated directly under a function room with balcony and almost every night we heard the dragging of chairs on the cement flooring until late. It didn’t keep the kids awake but was certainly very annoying while watching a movie. I called reception to talk about this and was told there was nothing she could do as “most nights there are functions there until 10pm”. The hotel doesn’t offer room service, which is a luxury most people look forward to in hotels. There is a great restaurant called Tiki’s Bar and Grill (which I’d highly recommend) in the hotel, however they don’t deliver meals to your room.A few other disappointing things:-On more than 1 occasion our bins (there were 4 in the suite) were not emptied, there were hardly any kitchen supplies to cook with – cutlery, plates etc were fine however there weren't many items to sufficiently cook a meal with, the air conditioning was very temperamental on about 3 or 4 occasions we needed to call reception to send someone to fix it, valet parking is very expensive and the sofa bed is extremely uncomfortable and when folded back into a lounge formation it was missed when housekeeping came around to make the bed. All in all the hotel is great but the location and view is better and that’s what’s taking us back for the 4th time next year.","Sydney, Australia","JulesCarter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",7,4.0

This time we booked an ocean front room and the view was well worth the extra money. The room we were given was quite large and the three of us had plenty of room. Check in was a little disappointing in that they did not honour our reservation request of a room on a higher floor but after having a chat with staff they quickly changed the room to the floor we had originally requested. Also had to wait three hours for the room but that time was easily filled in by shopping and visiting the beach. When the room was ready our bags were there waiting for us. The only issue we had when we first got to our room was that the previous occupant had spilled something on the bed which had sprayed onto the wall but upon notifying housekeeping they came to our room literally within two minutes to change the bed and clean up for us. You can't really get better than that! The breakfast in the morning was great with plenty of selections and they provided us with a cooler bag - not sure about the previous comments about a cardboard tray as did not see any evidence of this with other guests. Also not sure why so many people comment about the lifts as they are very easy to use and it is quite a smart system would like to see this system in other lifts as it does save waiting. The valet team were brilliant and always had our car ready and waiting when needed. Wolfgang Puck's again was very handy for dinner not to mention Cold Stone Creamery which we visited probably one time too many! Otherwise very happy with this hotel, the service, the staff and particularly the location which is right across from the beach and a short walk to the shops. We will of course stay here again and again.

Great convenience shop downstairs, sold a variety of bevvies to tickle your fancy at a nice price. The rooms were small, and needed a good refurb.

View was to die for- partial ocean view of Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach. We were on the 22nd floor ( Rm. 2226) - quiet and peaceful. Had a chance to see the Hawaii Five O premier from out hotel balcony.Free Breakfast from 6:30am - 9:00am- assortment of pastries, fresh cut fruits, bagels, juices, flavored/regular coffee, hot chocolate, cold cereal and instant oatmeal. Also- Miso soup, sushi, pickled spiced cabbage. (Note: at the beginning of our stay they gave us trays, later on we received the breakfast on the beach bags). Hope they keep giving the bags, nice feature.Expedia travel consultants on site- Really appreciated their help with planning out excursions around Oahu- all pick ups right in front of hotel except the Midnight Catamaran cruise by the Sheraton.Elevators- unique and secure- swipe your room key and key in your floor number, then the monitor will flash the elevator to board. Great since one only has access to floor where they are staying. One can return to lobby from their floor by pressing "" * "" on panel. Easy once you get the hang of it.Negatives- Staff seemed very limited around hotel, except for maids. I'm not sure if I ever knew who was the hotel manager. Front desk staff did not seem very knowledgeable about status of Breakfast bags (available/not available?)Check out was very long and tedious- wasn't enough staff to handle patrons checking in or out. No one informed patrons waiting how the wait time could be shortened by using express check out.Staff didn't greet you at times in hotel. Not alot of staff/patron communication going on. Good thing I'm very independent.

I have to say all of my fears were put to rest within hours of checking in. Our room was clean, king size bed and enough storage for a 9 day stay. The bathrooms are in need of updating, but they were clean and functional. Great water pressure, good lighting and we always had hot water and clean towels. I recommend staying in rooms 01-03 on any floor higher then 8, as they have what I thought was the best view of Diamond Head. (Don't take rooms 06 or 07, too close to the elevator and ice machines, you will hear them all night.) The breakfast was set up and ready to go by 6:30 each morning, we did spend the extra $3 for waffles, which were great. I didn't like that they no longer give you the lunch box to take to the beach. The small paper trays made it hard to travel with food. They do offer towels and chairs for the beach (at no charge), I suggest you bring a reusable tote to carry the towels. And water shoes are a must! The pool was a bit small, but never seemed to be over crowded. The Tiki bar right next to the pool area was great. 2pm-5pm happy hour and you can bring your beverage to the pool. Thought their (Tikis) lite fare menu was better and priced more resonable. Music every night!Loved that they had multiple information areas for excrusions and Valet parking. Most of our pickups for excrusions were right out front of the hotel or at the next corner. This Hotel is located at the end of the main street, but across from an area of Waikiki beach perfect for families with small children. It was a 10 minute walk to Lewers Ave, the area we found great resturants and shops. We used the hotel computer center to check in for our departure. That was free, but any other computer service had a charge. What I didn't like, they charged me $3 a day to use the inroom safe, they didn't have the totes for breakfast and the couple we were traveling with had issues with their room. The staff made it right and were very accomadating but it did take 4 different rooms and 2 days.

Ate breakfast on the verandah most mornings watching the world go by and sometimes in the late afternoon took in some sun. After a rough start with a very noisy family in the adjoining room at the rear of our room for 2 nights we finally got some peace and quiet and enjoyed the remainder of our 9 nights there. Tikis is a great little place on pool level - live music and good food and service.I would definitely stay here again as it is good value for money, location is great and the staff are very nice - the hotel is just across the road from the beach. The hotel itself is getting tired and is due a refurbishment.There is nowhere to put toiletry bags in Room 1129 - no bench in the bathroom - you have a choice on the floor or on the toilet lid. Plenty of towels and toiletries but they don't give you much toilet paper - a spare roll would be a good idea. Tip: you need to raise the bath plug to shower or you will end up more than shin deep in water.Lighting in our room was poor in the living/bedroom area - it's very dark - 2 bed lamps and 1 decorative lamp - I left things behind because I didn't see them however a call to housekeeping from the airport saved the day and they mailed the items back to me. Our door presented problems accessing the room but after a couple of days we worked out you had to pull the door towards you then insert the key or it wouldn't unlock.The breakfast can be a bit hit and miss if it rains. Things become chaotic as there is no cover and not enough seats and some of the food gets wet - but it is good value in that you get coffee, tea, pastries, cereal, fruit, yoghurt and some Asian breakfast items. You can pay extra for waffles and other hot food. Tip: Take a small plastic carry bag for your pastries etc - they give you a cardboard tray to put cups in and not easy to manage everything.Something I noticed this trip and this has absolutely nothing to do with the hotel itself or our holiday experience in any way - it's purely my observation of the general area - there were quite a few homeless people living at the Diamond Head (south east) end of Kalakaua (main street along the beach) and in the park over the road at the beach. Some local Hawaiians told us the US government is sending homeless people from the mainland to get them out of the cold. The plight of these people is very sad - many of these people have chairs, umbrellas, bedding and their belongings all set up and have a daily routine where they while away their days in the sunshine as the tourists walk on by - they don't bother anybody ..... it's just my observation.....","Brisbane, Australia","DarTravelbug</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",53,4.0

We stayed at the Aston Waikiki and had a great time. This hotel is probably the best buy around. Right across the street from the beach and within walking distance of all the other hotels and resturants on the Waikiki strip (bring your walking shoes!!). The desk staff were friendly and helpful. We arrived around 1:30 and were able to check in early. As indicated, the room was on the small size (we had two double beds) but enough room for the two of us. Yes, the bathroom was also small with very little counter space, but somehow we made it work with all the stuff we brought. It was clean and the view off the balcony was terrific (We had a select ocean view room - 20th floor). The housekeeping staff was great and very accomodating.The elevator system was unlike any we've encountered. Very easy to use and safe (don't understand why people had issues with it). You just swipe your room key and punch in the floor number and takes you right to your floor. The elevators are only busy around check in times (3:00) and even then, not as busy as other hotels we've been to.The breakfast buffet was also very nice. It had the basics.. pastries, yogart, fresh fruit, dry cereal, and eggs and waffels for a slight fee. There is also miso soup and noodles if you like Japanese cuisine. It's just enough to start the morning, but there are other places close by that serve the full breakfast menu if that's your thing. The only down side is that the hotel no longer offers the insulated carrier bags as advertised on the ""Breakfast on the Beach"" section of their web site.Tours were easy to book and the buses stopped in front of the hotel. If you want to avoid the tour bus thing you can always take public transportation (""The Bus""), but be advised that they run on ""island time"". It's cheap and good transportation as long as your not in a hurry.Be aware of the homeless people that sleep on the street and across the street at the beach. They never really bothered us and the police are always around to run them off.

I recently went back on vacation with my family and we enjoyed the convenience of the beach chairs and towels that we checked out every day to take to the beach.

We could not understand why it took so long for the elevators to work again. Our hearts went out to the bell boys who had to carry luggage that morning. They truly deserved a large bonus from the management. Always request an oceanfront room on the highest available floor as the view of the ocean is superb! The noise in the lower floors can be really loud as this is the main avenue in Waikiki and the rooms are not sound proof. The free breakfast is just OK.

The staff was really nice no issues at all. We did have an issue with our safe the first night however I called the front desk and someone was knocking on our door within a couple minutes, they replaced the battery and we were good to go.

Yes there are other buildings in your view, but if you ask for a ocean view on a high floor and as close to the ocean as possible, the view is magnificent, even with those buildings. The room was clean and cute. TV has limited selection but you can rent DVDs in the lobby for free.Pool and breakfast are pretty good, not great. There is a musician and hula dancer every morning, a nice touch. Coffee is bad (please improve this for our next visit!) and the rest is a typical continental breakfast.

It costs $27/day to have them park you car but I felt like it was worth it.

Almost every time I went to the front desk or called I had to wait far longer than I should have. I inquired about this and they told me they were training more people. Seems like they should have already done that. Please fully staff the front desk at all times!The elevator system. At first, it seemed genius (there is a computer system that reads your card and assigns you to a specific elevator depending on who else is requesting the elevator in which direction and what floor they are going to). It works VERY well. Unfortunately, on our last day, it completely broke down for 3-4 hours, and all guests in the full hotel could only access the 20+ floors by emergency stairwell, and it seemed to overwhelm the staff as it took them a long time before staff was in place to guide guests to where they needed to go.

Also there are lots of shuttles stopping here, which is good, regardless if it is the free Hilo Hattie or any excursion bus stopping.The pool was very nice for a quick swim (when the beach becomes to salty for you), and also sun chairs etc was very comfortable (even though the sun only arrives somewhat after 10-11 am, but not really a problem for us).The beach style breakfast was a adventure in it self, since the thing presented to carry it in, was a cup holder and small paperbags, and since that was not easy to carry around you wanted somewhere to sit, but that was not really easy, due to lack of space.

It was overlooking the ocean and you got look down the street and see all the people out an about. The room was a tad bit small but ""who comes to Hawaii to spend the day in the room?"" Our room was used for storage of our things, showering, dressing, and of course we were on our honeymoon...wink wink!!! One thing I really liked was the elevators. Your key card only gives you access to the floor you are on. So you didnt have to worry about kids playing on your floor, or someone being on your floor who didnt belong there.

If you are taking any kind of tours, going to see attractions, or whatever you may want to do every tour bus, trolley and public transportation picks up and drops off in front of the hotel. The breakfast was convienent but nice, I only wish they had a bigger selection to choose from. Plus it was nice to be able to save the money on breakfast because eating in Waikiki is expensive. There are plenty of restaurants and shops around. For the women shoppers...Designers Row is right up the street...fellas keep your lady away from this area...haha!!!! This hotel has a nice pool, but I didnt use it. I mean ""I'm in Hawaii, and I wanted to go to the beach!!!!"" The part of beach in front of the Hotel is great for non swimmers and beginners, because there is a man made wall to block the current from pulling you out and only gets about six feet deep at the most, and there is a lifeguard on duty during the day. The last thing was the service. It was really great. They were upfront about addtional fees. they have a amenity fee of 10 dollars a day, which covers your safe usage, high speed internet, room phone and DVD/blu ray rentals/PS3 game rentals(there is a PS3 in the room), there were a few other things included in that fee but i thought it was a great idea.

My initial impressions were not good and while I appreciate this hotel is not in the same league as the Elara Hilton I was a bit disappointed.I thought the general decor of the hotel and rooms needed a makeover and everything looked a bit tired. We had a room on the 27 floor with a side view of the beach (just) which looked directly across to the next hotel block which was quite close.If our room is the normal standard in the hotel then it needs some money spending on it. Drab paintwork and carpets and a bathroom that was nearing the end of its life. Having said that, it was comfortable and clean and we had no issues with the maid service which always seemed to be done whenever we got back to our room.Breakfast is a bit of a scrum and there's limited seating to eat round the pool area so we took ours back up to the room every day. 'Continental' style breakfast with pastries, cakes, fruit, yoghurt etc which couldn't be faulted - as much as you can carry sensibly back to your room!Tiki's bar and restaurant adjacent to the pool area is excellent with a good atmosphere, food and service. We ate in there two or three times during our week stay and it was all excellent and the place was buzzing every night.Step across the road from the hotel and you are on the beach, which also cannot be faulted for cleanliness - a beautiful stretch of coastline. There are limited sun beds and parasols for hire and tend to be quite expensive ($15 per day sun bed, $20 per day parasol, I think) which could add up over a week. Most people used beach mats/towels. You can use folding chairs which are supplied by the hotel free of charge - get these in the corner of the pool area by the omelette ordering counter at breakfast. We kept ours for the whole week. Pool/beach towels are also provided by the hotel.10 minute walk into the centre of Waikiki where there are restaurants, shops and the usual evening life one finds. I found it to be a bit classier than I imagined with some hi-end shops and very pleasant surroundings.After bad initial impressions I really warmed to the hotel and the place in general and was sorry to go. Would I recommend it? Well yes, as long as your standards in hotel accommodation are not too high but rather around the middle somewhere, then I would recommend for excellent position within easy reach of all other amenities that Waikiki has to offer.

It was basic clean,the balcony looked like it had not been cleaned for some time and the bathrooms are dated.

You cannot expect 5-star amenities from a budget-friendly hotel. Having said that, we have nothing but (mostly) good things to say about this place and would definitely stay there again. The hotel is what I would classify as a large boutique hotel (if there is such a category). It is nicely-decorated, clean, full of activity, easily accessible and, in my opinion, in the best location on Waikiki beach. It is in the less-crowded area of the beach at the end of the strip and you can easily walk either south toward the parks, zoo and aquarium or north to the bustling central hotel/shopping area. (However, there is shopping right across the street, too and plenty to do within just a couple blocks of you are less mobile. There are ABC stores on about every corner, and they are great places to buy affordable Hawaiian souvenirs and snack items.)We did not find merit in any of the complaints we had read about the hotel on this site. The rooms are on the small side, but this is true with any budget-friendly hotel in a popular tourist destination or large city. The breakfast area by the pool was a bit crowded, but we went at all different times and found plenty of food available and a place to sit every time. Sure, the breakfast is mainly donuts, fruit, and yogurt--but it's FREE, so what do you expect? If you get tired of it, there is a McDonald's two blocks away where you can get a full Hawaiian breakfast for $5-6. Breakfast also included live music and hula dancing.We also found the decor to be tasteful. One of the reviews we read said the red and white colors and floral fabrics were ""dated."" C'mon, people! It's HAWAII. Red and white . . . and floral is everywhere! The furnishings were also clean and in good condition. The bathroom was arguably a bit dated but fully functional, large enough and everything worked as it should have. We found the mattress on the bed to be extremely comfortable. Our balcony on the 22nd floor, overlooking the pool and beach was absolutely delightful. If there is any way to locate yourself on a higher floor and as close to the beach side of the hotel as possible, I think you'll find it worth the extra money. Some of the lower floors right above the pool and on the back side of the hotel lack a good view and are probably quite noisy. We enjoyed Tiki's restaurant and bar at this hotel very much. It was a fun place to have drinks and listen to live music in the evening and the food was very good, as well. There is also a Wolfgang Pucks, ColdStone Creamery, Subway and some sort of cookie store in the same building. The pool is not huge, but it was also not crowded because most people are across the street at the beach. We also liked that it had a true deep end at close to 6', so you could actually swim and not just walk around, like in many hotel pools. The only negative experience we had at this hotel the whole week was with parking. We pulled up to check in during a busy time, and we were not ready to valet check our car yet. We wanted to drive around a bit and get a sense of our surroundings first. The lobby is up on the second floor, and we were told by a parking attendant that we could only leave our car for 10 minutes while we checked in. However, we had no control over how long the check in process would take during this busy time of the afternoon. We moved as quickly as possible through the process and up to our room to drop our bags and returned to our car only to find an angry parking attendant who yelled at us and then said loudly to another attendant as we got into our car not to let us back in when we returned! When we did return, his temper seemed to have simmered. He ""allowed"" us to park (for $27/day) and did not give us any other problems for the duration of the week. I'm not sure if the parking attendants work for the hotel or if it is a separate business, but this certainly did not make a good first impression on two weary travelers who had flown over 11 hours to get there. All in all, I cannot see why you wouldn't enjoy this hotel, unless you are expecting 5-star amenities for a 2-star price.","Mason, Michigan","Jill R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mason, Michigan</strong>",2,5.0

We had a partial ocean view room on the 11th floor which was good, our sink blocked and we had to be moved and we were moved to the 25th floor in an ocean view room, this was the better room and the view was excellent, however the room was smaller.For the price paid we did expect more in terms or service and breakfast, however we have found Hawaii in general not cheap if you want a view and to be along the beach. We are in the Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach for the remainder of our trip and we are already loving it, review to come!","Hope Island, Australia","mrsktm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hope Island, Australia</strong>",104,3.0

The bed was comfortable and the bathroom contained what was needed.There is a Tikis restaurant on pool level, overlooking Waikiki beach. The food and service is very good here.Breakfast would be my only quibble. Because the hotel is good value for money, its busy. Breakfast is a buffet, stuck in one corner of the pool area. When you check in, you are given a cooler bag between two which you fill up when you come to breakfast. Often though, the pool area is too full to find a spot to sit down and eat....something to think about...?Overall though, the Aston is a good place to lay your hat whilst filling your days with sightseeing.","Guildford, United Kingdom","LucyH186390</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Guildford, United Kingdom</strong>",57,3.0

It's situated in a city (and all that means) but steps from a beautiful Pacific beach (and all that means). The rooms themselves are clean and serviceable -- somewhat dated, but in a charming way. I recommend a higher floor (we stayed on the 22nd) not only for the views but also to distance yourself from the city hubbub. The hotel offers a bountiful free breakfast, providing each room with a vinyl ""Breakfast on the Beach"" cooler bag (which becomes a nice keepsake after your visit). This is an inspired idea; you can either eat your breakfast poolside (while soothing live music and hula dancing set a placid atmosphere) or you can pack your satchel and enjoy your repast on the beach. The hotel does charge for wireless internet, which is unfortunate. It's minutes from a variety of terrific restaurants and activities.","Bloomfield, New Jersey","PaulWhelihan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bloomfield, New Jersey</strong>",15,4.0

The free breakfast was a plus. The only negative was the $27 daily parking charge and valet only. Being located at the end of the Waikiki strip, it was nice and quiet and we only had to walk a few blocks to join in the busy nightlife of Waikiki. Our room was on the 23rd floor with an ocean view and we woke up to a beautiful view of Waikiki Beach every morning. I would definitely stay here again when I visit Hawaii again.

It has a continental breakfast.....and 2. its prior reviews. We stayed here for 7 days and it was great. We were on floor 22 facing diamon head and it was nice and quiet. Prior reviews told me to get the highest floor possible to avoid street noise and I agree. The continental breakfast was awesome! They had SO MANY pastries, fruit trays, cereals, and yogurts! They also had milk, juices, coffee AND MISO SOUP! You go down with your cooler bags, fill them up, sit down to eat, finish everything you got, then go back and fill them up again and go back to your room (or wherever). They also had a waffle and eggs to order for five bucks. If you stay downtown, breakfast is gonna cost you alot of money so staying in a hotel with continental breakast helps alot! Only has valet parking and they are great! Parking is free for military with PCS orders (bring a copy of your pcs reservation that says its free). We found pen marks on our front pasenger seat and they cleaned it right off with no hesitation! The beach is right across the street and its perfect for young children because it has a wall that prevents large waves from coming through! The tiki-bar restaurant is good but pricy. Wolfgang downstairs has great food and its decently priced. All the restaurants close by are expensive but good (>$50). No wireless internet sucks but o-well....$40 for a week of internet in the room. You can only use the elevator with a key....I really liked this feature! Goody bags for the kids upon arriving....very cool! Trolly stops at the hotel every half hour. BK and MCd's close by. Live music during breakfast. Pool is small, but who wants to swim in a pool when you got the beach a stone throw away? If you have kids, this is the place to stay.","Honolulu, Hawaii","civyl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",3,5.0

Also, to those in the forums who knew about where to park. $12 per day at the Banyan is a fair deal and it is less than a block from the Aston. Just drive in to the Aston to check-in and they will park your car there for the time it takes to check-in. Then take your car up the street to the Banyan to park. You just saved $15 per day. Another suggestion is to NOT rent a a car until you want to explore the island. It's a liability in Waikiki. There are trollies and other ways to get around.As for the hotel, the staff is very friendly. They do charge a $10 amenity free but that includes internet in-room(not wifi), free DVDs(current ones, too), and a safe. The breakfast with music and hula is OK. They give you a cold bag to carry the food to the beach. It also aids in portion control, I think. Gets old after 3 days, but so does Waikiki. The things to see I will cover elsewhere in the Waikiki section. Many people mention the elevators, which are different but not a problem. You adapt to them.They are somewhat noisy though, so try for a room away from them. As others have mentioned, staying high( 18th floor and up) up is good, as the street noise is significant.The rooms are small(why king-size beds?) with a small balcony. The ocean view rooms are worth it. We faced west and saw lots of activity, including fireworks, from our room. Sunset was lovely as well.","Bay Area, CA","CABozeman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bay Area, CA</strong>",47,4.0

Yes, it is a little pricer but it is location that bumps the price up. When we arrived the bell boys took our luggage and directed us up to the desk. The check in guy was very friendly and the hotel offered water with lemon or oranges! We then used our room key to access the elevators; which is a very secure feeling in the Waikiki area as I personally felt that area has a lot of thefts and crazy people. I say this as I watched two ladies get there purse stolen and the homeless are amusing but scary. However, this is not the hotels problem but they are nice to have a secure elevator system. We booked the junior suite, which is now called another name. It had plenty of room and after reading many reviews here are my thoughts: yes, the bathroom could use an update but ours wasn't the worst bathroom that I have seen. The beds were very comfortable and after touring, sightseeing they were nice to relax ans sleep in. The only complaint I would have on the room is noise. We could hear other vacations and you can hear the Tiki room at night. However, I don't vacation to be in a room - I can do that home. The hotel is across from the beach so that is very nice! The views are breath taking! It had a Wolfgang Express, Subway, and cold stone right downstairs. If you are traveling with kids - Burger King is a block away and McDonalds is two blocks away. We had our 9 year old and 6 year old so they were heaven! The pool is a tad small but who cares when you have a whole ocean to absorb!My only other complaint of the hotel is Peggy, who works at the tour desk - she was unfriendly and messed up a tour. Overall, you could read every bad review and hesitate to stay here but if you are traveling with kids and are an average family wanting to have fun in Hawaii versus a hotel - this is a great place to stay!!! The hotel gives the kids coloring books and crayons as well as a sandbucket and shovel in a tote bag. Beach and rainy day fun - they care about kids!! Also, the breakfast was good. They have the coolers to use which made it nice. You could get cereal, pastries, fruit, and some other things for free. You had to pay extra for waffles, french toast, and eggs but I didn't feel the prices were unfair.","Erie, Pennsylvania","Kyle N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Erie, Pennsylvania</strong>",0,3.0

Right across from the best part of the beach. The facilities; pretty good. Nice pool deck; on-site tuck shop with decent prices; nice eateries. We stayed in a tenth floor room on the ocean front. Excellent view. The included continental breakfast bar was fine. Eggs cost extra, which is ok, I guess. On-site car rental (tip, you only need to rent a car for a day if you're looking at touring the island.)) We used the city's public transit (stops located within a block) and it worked well to get to just about anywhere. This hotel was also a key tour bus pick-up spot, which is great! Proximity to good restaurants was welcomed. The onsite Tiki's bar and grill had an awesome indoor dining room and menu. Things that need work: the AC wasn't strong when we arrived: managed to make it work properly by keeping curtains closed during the day and propping open hallway door and lanai door for a few minutes to get a chilly air flow the first night. Also, wireless Internet available only on pool deck (it worked well), but only WIRED internet in the room. C'mon guys. No wireless in the rooms? Very inconvenient, and wouldn't have stayed there had I known. Glad I thought to bring my small laptop at the last moment. Cable selection; meagre but adequate. Otherwise, the bed was excellent; location; excellent; overally experience; very good. They have a unique way of getting an elevator, which meant that there was an elevator there within seconds of calling it. Nicely done.

Close enough to walk to everything but far enough away that it wasn't as noisy. The beach access right across the street was wonderful, especially for families with smaller children.We had a view of Diamond Head & some of the beach. The balcony was too small to have even one chair & the airconditioning on the condo next door was too loud to have the door open through the night so we had to run the airconditioning all night. The bathroom was clean but tired. It was so old that it didn't look clean but as I looked closer it was as clean as it could get. The beds & pillows were very comfortable!Breakfast was fine & we were grateful for it. We didn't have any problem with other people being rude or fighting over the food. The quality of the food was good, no complaints as we knew going in that it was just continental breakfast.We liked the elevator system a lot. Was not confusing at all & it adds a bit of sense of security.The mandatory $27.00 a day valet is irritating and because there is no other place for guests to park their car the hotel can charge whatever they want.

You could pick it up by the pool and take it to the beach or to your room, but it was very plain and quite boring. There is no wifi in the rooms, so we asked at the front desk where we could go online, and we were told, that the only place in the hotel with wifi was by the pool. We went out there, but after 5 minutes we were asked to leave because the pool area was closing. We asked where to go, but there was no other place - lousy service!

The hula dancer and singer were good. The breakfast was good for about 2 mornings then it became irritating and monotonous. Hotel staff was okay, depending on the person (check-in person was great, check-out person was rude). Overall I would recommend the Aston.

I wrote 3 emails to Aston Waikiki Beach explaining that the computers are located in their foyer, next to their reception and provided by the hotel to their guests, I got nothing but rude, denying replies with no care of responsibility of what happened.This put a huge damper on our HONEYMOON, we were constantly chasing our tail the whole time trying to remember what we had organised, finding address and phone numbers and not missing booked activity times.I strongly recommend staying somewhere a hotel would take some responsibility of something that happens under their roof; an apology would have been a starting point.The fact the hotel GM didn’t bother to return my call on a serious issue such as computer hacking and email fraud is a good indication of the customer service and staff you will find here.Try the Sheraton up the road, a little more expensive but worth every cent.",Sydney,"Luke T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",6,1.0

Ms. Wolfgramm coordinated the move with the hotel staff and upgraded our room to a junior suite with king bed and two balconies. She also saw to it that a folding bed was provided for my nephew at no extra charge. Our move was done very efficiently and professionally by the hotel staff.

We travelled as a family of three (2.5 year old son, and my husband and I). I would say this an average hotel with decent prices for the location. In the future, I would maybe stay again, but it didn't please us enough to rave about it. I would recommend it to others, but would tell them our pros and cons list for sure. Here goes:Pros:1. Good location, directly across the street from the beach. The beach across the street is great for kids, as it has a wave-breaking wall to make the water calmer. 2. Clean rooms, clean bathroom. Bathroom could use a renovation and they are small, but they are clean and do the trick. Beds were very comfortable. I noticed a bedbug-proof mattress cover on our bed. Lanai was an okay size. Had to bring a chair from inside for my husband and I to both sit on the balcony as only one chair is provided.3. Decent continental breakfast; hotel includes a free cooler bag at check-in. It includes fresh juice and fruit, muffins, pastries, doughnuts, mini bagels, cereal, yogurt, milk, coffee, Japanese breakfast items, instant oatmeal, and for a $5 charge, omelettes and waffles (?) as well. People did hoard food though, as you could only pass through the line once. Hula dancer and singer at the breakfast every morning. 4. Elevator system was a secure, efficient way of transporting people to their rooms and back. It can be confusing for some, but it really is common sense. You just need to take the time to understand how it works. Can be slower in the mornings, but still not that bad.5. Housekeeping was good, very friendly.6. In-room fridge was nice. Your typical bar-sized fridge. No in-room microwaves though.7. Ocean-view room was great! (We were on the 14th floor) More cost-efficient than ocean front, and I’m sure just as good views. Have heard that partial ocean view is not worth it though.8. Free wi-fi on the pool deck.9. On-site restaurants were good. I recommend Wolfgang Puck’s. There is Tiki's (make a reservation), a Subway, Honolulu Cookie Company, and Coldstone Creamery on site as well. ABC store around the corner.10. Hotel provides beach chairs and beach towels for free. They have to be returned by 7 p.m. or there is a $30 charge to your bill. 11. Securely stored luggage after check-out for 7 hours until our shuttle picked us up at the hotel. They have a large scale to use for free to weigh your luggage as well. 12. Located on the Waikiki beach “strip” but far enough away from the busy part of the strip, so it wasn’t as crowded with people.13. Use of a crib for our son for free.14. Only two blocks (on Kuhio Street) to the city bus stop. Very great way to get anywhere (we used it for Walmart, Ala Moana Center, and the Swap Meet by Pearl Harbour). It is $2.50 per adult and it includes as many transfers as you want for free within a 4 hour time frame after you pay. The cost for a youth was $1.25, and children under 6 are free if they sit on your lap. They can have a seat if the bus is not busy.15. Across the street from Honolulu Zoo, and a short walk to the Aquarium.16. There are four tour companies located in the lobby for your convenience. We never booked through them, as we had a referral to Affordable Tours (On Seaside Avenue, Across from Ross). They were GREAT!!!! We dealt with Lee and another woman, the prices were awesome compared to Expedia in the hotel, and all of the tours were unbelieveable. We strongly recommend taking the walk to book through them, but the companies in the hotel are there if need be. Some of our tours through Affordable tours were half the cost as others though. 17. There are double beach chairs located by the pool with a canopy to block the sun. Although we never used them, they would be nice. You must be there early to scoop on up though, as they go quickly. 18. Air conditioning in room worked well, although housekeeping changed the temp warmer when they came in.Cons:1. Unless you pay the $10 Amenity fee per day, you don’t get free LOCAL calling (inconvenient if you are trying to book tours or calling for food delivery), no use of the safe (safe-only cost per day is $3), or no wi-fi in your room. We would have sooner have them hide the fee in our cost per night, and just have full access to these items. 2. We were located in a room directly behind the elevator. VERY ANNOYING! Sounded so loud, like a fighter jet was flying overhead every few minutes. We asked for a new room, but apparently they were booked. No discounts/amenity fee waived. This made us very mad, as we had a 2.5 year old travelling with us and it disturbed his sleep.3. Small rooms. Would be okay if it is only 2 adults, but with one extra person, one extra piece of luggage, and his crib set up, it was quite cramped.4. Bathrooms need updating. No working bathroom fan. Very low showerhead. There were always good water temps and pressure though.5. After five days, the hired breakfast musician by the pool was getting old. Same music, same songs. 6. The Aston is a major stopping point for tour buses, trollies, etc. The sounds of the bells ringing on the trollies late at night god old fast too. I guess this is a positive for transportation; the loudness of it gets to you after a while. The Tiki's bar downstairs has live music every night. This was fairly loud, but didn't really bother us.7. Although the continental breakfast cuts the cost of one meal per day, we were sick of it after a week. Went elsewhere for a few days.8. The birds at breakfast were so tame that it was annoying. They were always by you waiting for a crumb to drop. It seems to be a problem in Waikiki in general though.","Saskatoon, Canada","PrairieFamilyof3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saskatoon, Canada</strong>",20,3.0

In addition, the rooms on the Diamond Head side are just too small to be comfortable. The location is good. The breakfast is very nice and although not hot, certainly enuff good fresh grub to hold you til dinner. The elevator problem of before is now solved and they work very efficiently. Our eating at the Tiki was VERY good indeed and on par with a 5 star. One piece of info; the free check out beach chairs are very nice at the beach area across the street and looking for the moving shade from the palms makes sitting out there makes for a very nice all day experience.

We booked through Costco and they reserved an ocean view room, not ocean view where you have to lean over your balcony and look way to the left or right. We had a great sight of surfers and the waves. That said, we had a few disappointments. We got hit with a $42.00 ""resort fee"" for internet, newspaper, etc. We were not told verbally that this was going to be an extra charge from Costco. The complimentary continental breakfast was a chore. They served it pool side and did not give you a tray to carry your food to a table. You had to make about three trips to carry everything you wanted. The quality of the food was nothing to rave about. Now about the elevators. You have a room key card. You pass it over the push buttons for the floors. You push the floor you want and a window tells you what elevator to take. Once inside, you can not push your floor number, its already programed. Going down you push ""star"" and it takes you to the third floor where the desk is. Then you have to take an escalator down to the first floor or find the secret elevator that takes you down to the first floor.

Partial ocean views aren't worth it; our view was mostly blocked by the hotel tower less than 25 yards away.The staff are friendly but they can't make up for the serious problems at this facility.

You do have to go to the pool area for free wifi, which is a litlte inconvenient, but not something I would complain about. At least there was that option. Some hotels charge you, with no option of free wifi at all. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were extremely clean. We liked the decor of the hotel and the rooms. There is no room service, but we never use room service, anyway. The part of the beach directly in front of the hotel has a wall, so there is no danger of venturing out too far. Our flight to come home was at night, so they let us move rooms after checkout so we wouldn't have to hang out on the beach or at the pool all day.

The swimming pool was fine for a dip but is pretty full of kids. The hotel really deserves better than a 3, but less than a 4. TA should shift to a six star system.Being right across the street from the beach was nice and would be appealing to a family with small children. That particular part of the beach is protected by a sea wall. So, it's like swimming in the ocean that's more like a pool -- no surf to speak of. I thought the breakfast was fine, the shuttle services were convenient and it was a close walk to restaurants and shops. Our room on the 16th floor was a regular room with a king sized bed and I thought it was plenty big enough. The view was great. The bathroom was in need of remodeling. I agree that the extra $10 daily charge for Internet is annoying, and when I was told it would only work for laptops, not iPads, I declined it, then was told that it was a mandatory add-on fee for several services. We only stayed two nights as a stop-over to see Pearl Harbor before our Maui vacation, and it was fine for a short stay.

We had a pretty nice ocean view and lots of space.Everything else about the hotel kind of reminds you of better times left behind, which is not that unusual in Waikiki unless you are willing to spend the really big bucks. All in all, the location is good, the pool is ok, the food not so hot and the overall atmosphere tacky, but kinda in a fun way. If you go on a weekend that is not packed, definitely get a good AAA rate and it's worth splurging for the suites. I never actually saw a room, but it would feel cramped I am sure and without a view.

Location. Right across the street from the beach with the sea wall. Virtually no waves. Good for families.2. Kid-friendly. We had our two kids (6&9) with us. They each got a small cinch sac, a sand bucket and shovel, and a coloring book and crayons at check-in. This makes them happy.3. Coupon book. I only wish I would have looked at it more carefully before spending over $100 at the gift shop at the USS Missouri only to find out that the Aston's coupon book had a 20% off coupon.4. Pool chairs. These chairs were awesome! Padded and everything. My non-sun loving husband managed to get one with a little roof...like a cabana chair. 5. Chair and towel check-out. They let you check out really nice, fluffy towels and fold-up lawn chairs to take to the beach. Free!! Just return them by 7 p.m.6. Elevator system. Scan your key card and enter your floor number, then you get assigned an elevator. Really nice! Kids also think this is fun.7. Fun, tropical room decor.8. Wolfgang Puck and other restaurants at street level. Good places to eat on way to/from beach.9. Cleanliness. The cleaning services did an exceptional job. They cleaned once while we were at breakfast and the room was spotless! What's not so great?1. Room size. OMG was this place small!! There were four of us and plenty of luggage, but this was probably the smallest hotel room I've ever seen. Maybe 18"" between one of the beds and the wall. Put a family of four in here and you're stepping on each other.1.5. Bathroom size. Again, it's small. Toilet fits under the vanity. My husband turned around too fast and his toothbrush fell into the toilet. Next day, I did the same thing with my hairbrush. Thank goodness for ABC stores. 2. Breakfast. People act like they've never seen food before. The free coolers to fill for breakfast is a cute, kitschy idea; but not fun when people are hoarding food and vulturing like this may be their only meal ever. We had one tiny cooler for our entire family while other people were carrying two and three coolers and filling them to the brim. Breakfast begins at 6:30. We were downstairs one morning at 6:15 because of a tour bus and there were probably 50 people in line already. It's survival of the fittest for sure.3. Partial Ocean View? Okay, this is probably my fault. I spent more money on the ocean-front condo in Kona and much less on this place. But the partial ocean view ONLY occurred when I stepped out onto my 18"" deep ""lanai"" and leaned out over the rail. We could see the back end of Diamond Head and directly into the hotel rooms of whatever was across the way. I can see where you could get some outstanding views from the other side of the hotel. Just not in our case. Pros do outweigh the cons, but really, the size of this room was CRAZY SMALL. I had originally wanted to stay in the Embassy Suites to avoid this whole type of thing, but I let my travel agent talk me into this. Beach access was great, kids loved it. Adults just wanted some space.","Liberty, Missouri","jmjbwolf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Liberty, Missouri</strong>",53,3.0

Family with teenagers. Booking was done through 3rd party website. Location is to the East of Waikiki's Kalakaua Avenue, close to Honolulu Zoo. A Starbucks is just around the corner, and there's plenty of convenience stores and small cafes at the ground floor of the building. The plus of the location is that it is quite a distance away from the crowd, and so the beach right across is not as busy. The delta will be that we have to walk a bit to get to the most hip and happening areas in Waikiki; and walk all the way back to the hotel. However considering all the delicious food in Hawaii that is a good additional cardio to burn off those extra calories (aside from surfing, snorkeling, etc).Check in was more relaxed compared to most mainland hotels. It is quite efficient but the atmosphere is more of a vacationer's leisure time and little to no effort to show a quick service. The elevators have no buttons to push inside, and only honors room key card. Without room key card, people from ground level can only go up to the 3rd level where the check in location is. Probably this is the hotel's way to prevent unauthorized people from going up to the hotel's guestroom floors. Have to say that the elevator programming is very sophisticated and well organized. With a swipe of your room key card at the reading area under the elevator buttons outside, you select which floor you want to go to from the buttons outside, and the system assigned you which elevator to take that will stop at your floor. Brilliant! The hotel has a package that enables you to borrow up to 3 DVD's and 2 PS3 games through the vending machines located at the lobby/check in area. Yes, there is a PS3/DVD player in the room! The room is quite spacious. We opted for a partial beachview room; and from the balcony we can look at the beach across the street. Very nice, with flat screen TV, fridge and powerful centralized AC. However the compensation for having a very advanced elevator system is that there is no wifi internet for your computer! Wifi is only available in the lobby/check in area. Computer have to connect to internet using a cable connection and that is a kiss of death for my iPad! So just be aware of that when you stays here - bring your laptop. The beds are very comfortable and welcoming after a full day of exhausting activities around the island. The bathroom is a bit on the small side and the water pressure is low and at times just trickling down; however it is quite fine if you don't have that much sand to wash off. A critical item that you need to know is that for a hotel with so many rooms, they do not have enough space and arrangements for breakfast! Breakfast is buffet style at the lobby/check-in/pool area. Rolls, muffins, fruits, juices, oatmeals, they even have Japanese/Korean section for miso soup and some sushi and kimchi. You have to pay extra if you want hot omelette or waffle. My son tried their waffle and was really disappointed since it is not to the standard that we used to. There's always a long line of people at the breakfast area, even before breakfast area opens. Everybody wants to grab breakfast before the crowd really rush in! The hotel provides a small plastic picnic bag in the room which you can stuff with all the breakfast food you want to bring out to the beach and have a picnic breakfast there. Quite a good idea, since the remaining people have to find whatever beach chairs is available around the pool to eat their breakfast. Need to be careful with all the birds coming in and peck at any unguarded plates! While having breakfast, there is this duo ukulele player and dancer that performs really good hula song and dance. Alas, most people are either too busy chowing or they are not as culturally educated since we are among the very few who applauded and appreciate their performances!Check out was quick even though the line is long as usual... We got an extension for a few hours for a fee since we are leaving on a late flight, and the hotel holds our bags in the ground floor concierge. All in all the hotel is not too bad and have some very interesting features, but just be prepared to meet long lines for check in/out, breakfast, and other services. Also expect to see relatively unsmiling and tired faces of the overworked employees, and the sour cherry on top will be the lack of wifi in the room.","Houston, Texas","RAdriansyah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",57,3.0

There was just something about the Aston that kept coming back to the top. So I sat on that thought and when I was ready to book I discovered a deal on their website and pounced. I could not have been more happy with my choice.Everything was perfect. Every staff member, every day, were polite, friendly, helpful and always had an aloha with a smile.I don’t understand other people’s issue with the elevator, I’ve never seen the system used before but it works perfectly. Swipe the card, press your floor and go to the elevator it displays …. it’s not rocket science people :)The room ? Perfect, we even had the red hibiscus drapes over the beds ala the website photos. Clean and serviced daily by a beautiful woman who also helped us with food choices, local places to eat and visit. We had a full front ocean facing room, views downtown to Waikiki to the right and Diamond Head off to the left. Being from the east coast of Australia I've never seen the sun set over the ocean as it rises over 'our' ocean at the beach. Spectacular !!The bathroom? A little small but had everything we needed, shower over the bath, hand basin and bench space. Oh and a loo. Being out all day it was not an issue at all. Could be if there were more than 2 adults.Breakfast? Ideal. Yes, sometimes it was a little busy and the brekkie food ran low but the staff were on top of that each day. Considering the number of people being served it was well managed. Special mention to Eric the guitar player and the beautiful hula dancer who perform every morning around the pool.Location? Perfect perfect perfect !!!! Being down the zoo end of the street it is on the last block so people and traffic have generally thinned out some what. Local bus stop is just around the corner so not far to walk at all. One good tip to remember is to get off the bus just before the zoo and walk the couple of blocks to the hotel (if coming back to Waikiki from Diamond Head direction) due to the hotel being on a one way street, otherwise the bus will drive all the way along a road behind the hotel to the other end of the Waikiki strip and make every stop on the way to the Aston (which will be the last hotel) it will save you a heap of time.Things to do? All within walking distance or jump on an Aloha bus, a trolley or tour bus from the street level lobby. We spent 8 days there and didn’t use or need a car or taxi at all.Yes the Tiki bar is downstairs on the pool level and yes it is generally busy and has live music but we loved it. Usually the music stopped around 11pm. We were on the 9th floor and it was lovely to sit out on the lanai listening to the world going about it's business below.If I am ever fortunate enough to visit the beautiful city of Honolulu again I wouldn’t even bother looking at any other hotels, I’d be booking with the Aston again without doubt !!Thank you for contributing to my dream come true holiday xo","Brisbane, Australia","Sharon E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",22,5.0

I would actually like to see the houses of the people that complain so much about little things while on vacation. We arrived at the hotel in a rental car, after taking a wrong turn and going through all of downtown which took alot longer than the freeway, but hey in Hawaii, relax and take in the sights. At the hotel we were met down stairs by, and I am bad at remembering names, the head of the valets. He took the keys and about broke his hand by the welcoming handshake and ""Aloha"" he gave us. I attempted to tip him and he shook his head no and said ""welcome and whatever I can do, let me know"" How cool is this? So the valet service for the week--excellent.Next we went to check in, the front desk people, all smiles--""Aloha, what can we do to help you?"" I told them our name and they said ""Oh we have been waiting for your arrival, how was your flight? Check-in took of all but 5 minutes. So the front desk service all week--excellent.The dreaded and wicked elevator system- It takes alittle patience but if you just follw the instructions and lose the ergency mode in you brain and think about what the security part of the operation is.....relax, hold the card right next to the scanner and then breathe. You are on vacation so act like it. The elevator takes time to arrive, it does almost every time as it has to travel from floor to floor with ""the other guests"" I don't know of any hotel that has an elevator for each and every guest.House keeping- Once off the elevatork, we passed by 3 housekeeping women. You would have thought they were our best friend, very friendly and after the first day, each time we passed them they would ask, of course after greeting us with ""Aloha"", if we needed anything. Knowing that we were not the only guests on the floor, and that I had more time than they did, I went to them and asked for any additional items I need and they were very helpful. I didn't see the need for them to remember to bring what I needed and the walk don the hall 50 feet to them to get what I needed insured me getting them and took the burden off them and reduced the likelyhood of me not getting it and ""becoming furious and letting it ruin my vacation(sarcasim). Our room was beyond fantastic. I admit that after reading some of the reviews I was ready to call the front desk, furious and telling tham I wanted a new room. I was already prepared to call another hotel and tell them I was coming there because of how terrible the room was, how small the vanity was, how worn the carpets were....but none of those things were there. None of those things were there. I have NO idea where all these people were at but they were not at the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel. Yes the Aston that is next to the Zoo and across from the beach. I could not find 1 thing, nor could my wife who loving is a very nit picking and has to have everything perfect. The view was perfect. The bed, although not ours at home that we sleep on every night and are use to, well was not ours that we sleep on at home, I know I repeated myself but to get the point across I have never sleep on a hotel mattress that is broken in and contours like ours at home. Same with the pillows. I don't use one but my wife, knowing this has travelled with her own pillow, taking it around the world with her. She does that so ""she doesnt have to complain about a hotel pillow, a trivial, small thing that could otherwise taint a vacation. Prior to adding an exhaust fan in our home we would have to crack open the bathroom door to prevent a fogged mirror. This was usually in the winter time when we would take steaming hot showers. With the warm temps in Hawaii it was never a need to take a very warm shower because it would just keep us warm. Enough said. I found no worn carpets, faded drapes, dirty floors, although in Hawaii I would expect to find sand but didn't. Son the Room---Excellent.The breakfast buffet-On vacation I like to over-indulge in bacon and eggs and other things that I really shouldn't eat. Thankfully the buffet had none of those things. The food they had was very good. I can't see how anyone could complain. The rolls and pastries go fast but with the pack mentally of some people and thinking that this is there one and only meal of the day. I don't thinks the hotel would do it but the should limit the amount of pastries/rolls to maybe 10 per person(again sarcaism). The attendants at breakfast were as quick as they could move to replenish the supplies and were helpful with me. I am sure it helped that I was not loud and demanding and not acting like I was the one and only guest there. Breakfast....ExcellentValue- I did not want a cheap hotel. There are reason why cheap hotels are cheap, that is something people just have to learn. I did not want to stay in an expensive hotel, I have and I didn't like the atmosphere and the mannerism of the people working there. I understand those employees do that because sme guest expect that. Like going into a high dollar car dealership. The Aston Waikiki Beach was a perfect fit for us. Tasteful, friendly, elegent. The hotel is not responsible for the few rude guest we encountered; we were not going to allow them to hamper our Island experience. We did our research on this hotel, we addressed concerns with the management and staff before making our decision, we loved our experieince there and will stay there again. I feel for the person with the broken a/c but I know from my interactions with the GM Mark and the front desk staff that if that person would have requested another room it would have been given. Or at least left the room to the Tiki Bar (the hotel would have probably paid your bill, and as warm blooded I am sunset was pretty nice weather outside) For anyone considering the Aston, I do not normally write reviews but this place has been given bad reviews by, well, just refer back to the title of this review, enough said.

(if I were 18, I would want to be at the Outrigger down with all the bigger action.) Anyway, this hotel had some really good reviews but mine won't be one of them. The first problem is the horrible double beds and pillows. I never got one good night's sleep. We had sore necks and backs every morning. I tried several of the clothes that we brought folded up as pillows once I realized what I was in for.  The next problem may not be bad for the guys, but for any woman traveling with a husband and sons, the bathroom was a HUGE problem to me. It is so small and is filled with condensation and fogged up mirrors instantly leaving you no way to get ready for anything if the guys have to be ready at the same time. There is no vanity with a good mirror and plugs for your curling iron or blow dryer should you try to get ready out of the bathroom. I hate to say it but at the Marriott next door, the shower and toilet are separated with a door from the bathroom vanity and this is more important than I realized before I made the reservation. The only other thing was that I did keep having to tell the maids to PLEASE leave more than two or three washcloths with four of us in the room. I had to say it every day. Yes, I loved the big breakfast buffet and the fact that they give you a cooler bag to fill up and take to the beach. Yes, the location is great. Yes, I loved going to Lulu's on the very corner upstairs. Yes, I loved the live music and the great singers that they chose for Lulu's and Tiki's Bar and restaurant. Yes, I loved that I could jump on the trolley for $2 and take it 10 blocks up the road or to the mall.

That said, it was not enough to override the pleasant service we received, the very convenient and cost-efficient big breakfast of donuts, bagels, muffins, cereal, fruit, etc, and the outstanding Ocean View.

It is right across the street from the beach and within walking distance to everything because it is located right on the main strip. Breakfast is included but if you want hot food, lt is extra.

Since there is so much to do in Hawaii, we were not in our room that much, but I would not stay here again and saw many other hotels I would have preffered.Pros-Tiki's Bar and grill was a very nice place to eat or get drinks.

The bathroom was no better than a cheap motel's bathroom. I would have liked to have taken a bath to relax, but I wouldn't even think of taking one in there. There is no way I could have gotten reading in my wedding dress in there either. -Hard to know where we were supposed to go to check in when we first arrived. We were dropped off down below, and you had to go up to I believe the 2nd floor to check in to a very small lobby area. We spent the first 10 minutes in the elevators trying to get to the right floor. The elevators were fine once we figured out how to use them. But with no room card to use right when we got there and being tired from travelling, they were difficult.-Bathroom towels had hairs in them on several occasions!

Take your time and wait for the hordes of people to leave!2) Quiet beach across the road, well, quiet by Waikiki standards anyway!!3)Tikki bar & Grill! Super Yummy!!! here's a tip, if you find them online and sign up for their e-mail club you get a free ""appetizer"" as it turns out if you sit in their bar area instead of the restaurant anything on that menu is considered an appetizer...I got a burger and French fries for FREE! and while I'm on a roll if you walk down the Waikiki strip they have an amazing Cheesecake factory, go sign up for their e-mail club too and you get a free slice of cheese cake!!4) A very pretty hula dancer is dancing ever morning with some music while you eat your free breakfast.5)The elevator issue is really not as big of a deal as everyone makes it out to be!6) Trolly will pick you up just outside the hotel. Grab a map and this is by far the finest way to get around not to mention the cheapest (other than walking), I think it was $2.00 per person each way. I'll put it this way, take a look at other hotel prices that are in Waikiki directly across from the beach with a cute room (and clean), free breakfast, free entertainment, an awesome restaurant and compare the price.

Our last hotel was the Aston, and we were pleasantly surprised. They offered a great rate for HI residents, which influenced our decision on choosing this hotel. The location can't be beat. The beach is across the street, the Honolulu Zoo, and Waikiki Aquarium are a few blocks away. Breakfast on the beach...they provide you with a lunch sized cooler and you fill it with all the breakfast goodies you want, (continental and more hearty choices) and you can either eat poolside, or take your cooler across the street and have your breakfast on the beach. Check-in was quick, and the hotel staff were very helpful in all ways. Will surely stay here again.","Aiea, Hawaii","daddy808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aiea, Hawaii</strong>",38,4.0

Later we were moved to a room closer to the oceanside after a bug invasion problem. Problems with the air-condition in the room were taken care of and solved promptly and efficiently. Good housecleaning of room although always late in the afternoon. The breakfast buffet at the pool area with live musical entertainment, hulo songs and dancing, was actually very enjoyable and pleasant although ""camp style"" and crowded, sitting wherever you could find space.

Walked to beach and hopped a catamaran sunset ride for $20 each. Hiked Diamond Head. (bring water). The breakfast was fine as far as continental breakfasts go-variety. We did choose to go out for breakfast a couple mornings. They give you a beach towel every day that you can use at pool or beach, as well as a beach chair. Had entertainment at pool during breakfast which was nice. They held out luggage as we had to check out earlier than our flight was. No charge. Even let us weigh one as it's weight was questionable for us. The area is very busy with people clad mostly in bathing suits or shorts and tanks. Don't overpack. Very casual. The ABC stores have the best deals for souvenirs & they are everywhere! Post Office is located upstairs at International Market which is a nice place for shopping, but watch prices. Many booths sell same thing but prices vary-and you can talk them down easily. We went May 22-27, 2012 and the trade winds were daily. Every day was a bad hair day and hang on to your hat!!

The room itself was impeccable with very comfortable furniture and an understated Hawaiian motif. The free breakfast was wonderfully convenient. While the food was just a mix of danish with some rice, kimchi and soup; the hotel provides a souvenir lunch box so that the breakfast can be taken down to the beach, eaten in the room, etc. Our room also had a refrigerator in it so this breakfast food served as a mid-day snack as well. My only downside to this hotel is that it is located right in front of the wall in the water of Waikiki beach. This means that you will have to walk about 1/2 a mile down the beach to get to a location with any kind of waves. While this could be viewed as a positive by some, I would choose a hotel further down the beach for a future visit.","Carmel, Indiana, United States","Reijo S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carmel, Indiana, United States</strong>",7,4.0

We had an unobstructed view clear up Waikik Beach and we enjoyed many hours on our lanai just watching the waves. We had a perfect vantage point for some spectacular sunsets. The location is convenient to dining and transportation (we used the bus for our exploring). When we arrived we had a very nice card from the General Manager -- this was a nice touch and characteristic of the service and attitude of the staff. Each and every employee was cordial and pleasant and took the extra effort to make sure we had a nice stay. Our room had plenty of room for the two of us and we slept like babies in our comfy king-sized bed. The maid kept our room in tip top shape and any small requests were taken care of ASAP. (e.g. we had only one chair on our balcony and a note left resulted in a second chair magically appearing!)The front desk were informative and happy to answer any questions we had about touring and how to get from here to there!The internet around the pool was more than adequate for staying in touch with loved ones during our visit. The pool had plenty of chairs that were comfy and cozy. They had shade bonnets if you didn't want to get too much sun -- this was a complimentary feature that other hotels can charge for. We liked the decor and felt like it put us in an Oahu mood from the minute we stepped into our home away from home. The bathroom was immaculate and the shower curtain and mats were fresh and new. The breakfast at the pool was really good -- while my husband pigged out on sweets, I loved the miso soup and sticky rice. There were bagels and cream cheese too. Lots of fresh fruit, cereal, and yogurt. The entertainment was a lovely way to start the day! Lots of days we took our cooler bag back to the room and ate on our lanai so that we could enjoy our magnificent view!I would happily recommend this hotel to anyone and would be glad to answer any specific questions you might have!","Glenside, Pennsylvania","Pattyannkess54</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glenside, Pennsylvania</strong>",75,5.0

When we got to the room, I was pleasantly surprised that the ""partial ocean view"" meant just that. From our 7th floor balcony, we had a glorious view of the beach and looking out at Waikiki beach.The room was clean, although the bathrooms are a little tired and could use a little more work. But there were no real issues with the bathrooms. The cleaning staff did come in to clean it as best they could each day. My only complaint with the cleaning staff is they seem to have an odd order to when they get to each room. Some days they come early and some way late.Initially, we had trouble with the safe. It didn't work and the front desk sent someone up in 10 minutes who fixed it by changing the battery. The dressers in the room have very shallow drawers. There wasn't adequate room for a couple to put away all our clothes, so it was impossible to keep the room tidy.There was only high speed Internet in the room which is wired. This is not useful for most people these days as few carry laptops on vacations. We needed wifi and came prepared. We brought a router and hooked it up in our room. Worked like a dream! We had our own hotspot in the room. Most others with iPads had to use the, by the pool, which had open wifi.A continental breakfast was included each morning by the pool. Mostly carbs there but they did have a nice miso soup and the option to order French toast or omelets for a fee. They provide each guest with an insulated lunch bucket but you are only allowed one entry to get your breakfast. So people loaded up and the containers were difficult to manage. Refills only allowed on coffee.It was lovely though that every morning, there is a young man playing Hawaiian music and a hula dancer. There were a different coupling daily, but all quite good.We are movie lovers. One very different feature in this hotel is the included unlimited play station game rental or DVD movies. We must have taken out 6 movies from their kiosks.  Nice way to relax after a day of hiking. Diamond Head is about a mile away from the hotel, so don't need other transportation to go there. The hotel is situated at the end of the strip, but everything is close by, so a few blocks to walk to the middle of the strip. There is a nice selection of eating establishments right on this block, so if someone doesn't want to walk, they don't have to.The most curious thing with this hotel is their ""activity fee"" of $10 per day. They say this is to cover the safe, movies, Internet, fitness room, etc. Well,, this fee isn't optional, so why isn't it just included in the room price? I'm not complaining, because we were aware of the charges prior, so it wasn't a surprise. And the front desk did make it very clear on check-in what the charges were covering. Just that I prefer to have one price, and not pay piecemeal. The beach is just across the street from the hotel, which is super. I think it is one of the nicest parts of Waikiki Beach and we did walk the whole beach. It's very nice that the hotel will provide you with chairs for the beach, so that you don't have to rent them for an exorbitant cost. Their pool was quite nice too, but wish it was heated.The little things that I mentioned as negatives, we're just that, little. I don't believe any place is going to be perfect, and none of it marred our vacation in any way. We really had a lovely time there, so that's why I give it 4 stars.",Pembroke Pines,"Laureeeta18</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pembroke Pines</strong>",30,4.0

The room itself had a really bad smell, like a dirty hamper. It was pretty dated, the bathroom was kind of old and nasty, but it looked clean enough. I brough my own pillow cases to cover the pillows on the bed, hotel beds kinda creep me out. After reading some other reviews on other hotels on this strip about having bed bugs, I wasnt feeling to good about it. We ate at Wolfgang Pucks downstairs and had a really good quick meal, although my husband seen a large roach in the kitchen! The Tiki restaurant by the pool was really good, and we went to the happy hour at 2pm-5 and had some good deals on drinks there! Then had a early dinner, very good!

People will tend to stay there long after they eat breakfast but what can you do. Room was clean too. I know some rooms do have much of a lanai but all the oceanfrom ones do. Spend the extra bucks for it. Nice to sit there when you are up at 3 or 4 in the morning your first day or two there (if you come from the east coast). Not far from the international market place. Think it is closer that if you are at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Compare the rates for oceanfront rooms with the others that are on the beach. If you have the oceanfront you can at least people watch as there is a small park there and not just beachfront. And the breakfast is pastry and fruit and since it is included in your rate a good value. Saves you $10 or $20 a day since food is somewhat expensive. Would stay there again.

Our room was quiet but we were away from the elevators. Service was great and we were always greeted with a smile and staff were helpful.The breakfast is kind of crazy, we only ate it one day because of our schedule but you will be battling a lot of others.

Within walking distance of the ""International Marketplace"", because that area of town has most of the action.2. Protected beach right across the street, which is not only good to keep unwanted sea creatures out (read: sharks), it keeps the sand in and protects the coral reefs, and acts as a wave break so younger children can enjoy themselves without your constant help.3. Beautiful Establishment, especially considering that its not as shiny and new as some hotels. The grounds are very well maintained, and the motif says ""Hawaii"" without being too overstated.4. The staff does a nice job, and the expedia local expert office inside is very accommodating. I highly recommend you check them out, either before your trip or at the hotel, for booking any activities (i.e. Polynesian Cultural Center, Pearl Harbor, Atlantis Submarine Tours).5. The pool and pool area is nice looking, although we never used it. We are at the beach for goodness sake.6. Tiki's Grill and Bar was a nice experience for us. Good food, drinks, and service. Fairly priced for Waikiki. The manager also came by for a visit and made us feel as if we were catching up with an old friend; I really appreciate that kind of service.7. Our ""Ocean View Room"" was great, we has a Single King, which was very comfy. The room was very clean and nicely decorated, and unlike so many other hotels, it actually looked like the pictures from their website.8. Breakfast on the Beach is a nice little bag they provide so that you may take your Continental Breakfast to the beach if you wish. They also gave my daughter a nice little bag of toys to play with at the beach.The So So:1. The balcony furniture should be updated in the near future, as it has yellowed overtime and will likely begin breaking up from sun exposure soon. They should also add a second chair so that you may sit with your loved one and enjoy the sunset if you wish.The Bad:2. Amenity Fees! This is a new thing at ALL HOTELS in Hawaii. $10/day for soap, shampoo, PS3, etc... This is a load of BS, but after I returned home I learned from another reviewer that you can refuse the amenities and not be charged. good to know.Not too shabby overall. We also stayed at the Aston Aloha Beach on Kauai and enjoyed it as well. If I ever return to Waikiki I will stay here again, and will definitely check them out on any other islands we may visit as well.","Washington, Oklahoma","CaseyW721</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, Oklahoma</strong>",12,4.0

The location was great, within walking distance to about any place on Waikiki. The breakfast was a time saver, as well as a money saver, and the insulated bag came in handy our whole trip. (we went to 2 other islands) And they had hula dancers at breakfast. Nice touch! The only reason I did not give the Aston Waikiki a 5 is some wear showing around the edges in the bathroom. (but it was clean, and fully functioning) Also the beach renourishment going on in front of the hotel was a little disappointing, but they have no control over that, and it is a short walk in either direction to a good beach.

There is an indoor dining room off the grill area, more expensive but excellent food.We did not care much for the air conditioning in the room, it started up too often, waking us up, and blew cold air right across the beds.It's about a $40 taxi ride from the airport but there is a airport shuttle service in the morning which charges $10/person.It's a 1 block walk to city bus service, which will take you anywhere in Honolulu for $2.50/person.","Ottawa, Canada","Reluctant_flyer333</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",32,4.0

The morning ""breakfast on the beach"" is pretty great too -- standard grab 'n go fare, but plentiful and an easy way to get an early start on the day. I also really liked the automated elevator system that was very efficient and made for short wait times.There are two areas where I would like to see the hotel make improvements:(1) In-room Internet service is wired only, so you can't use any wireless-only devices, e.g. iPad or iPhone. The service at least is ""free"" (included in the $10 daily resort fee). Wireless is available on the pool/lobby/breakfast level, although I constantly had trouble keeping a connection. My tip: Go to the Starbuck's on the corner.(2) Valet service was really spotty. At $27/day, I found this level of service unacceptable. Slow service, constantly complaining, long waits on the phone, forgetting to get my car once requested, etc. After this last instance, I could even hear them badmouthing me after I didn't tip them.

The service was great. Everyone from the front desk, to housekeeping and the valet were friendly and extremely helpful. In addition to this, there were a couple of innovative things that made the stay even better. One was that they gave us a soft cooler to use for the free breakfast. This allowed us to load up on cereal, fruit, yogurt and pastries to take to the beach and eat later. The other was that we could rent as many free DVDs as we wanted at kiosks in the lobby to play in our room. Both these things, plus the free internet service in our room, saved us a lot of money.

As for the Aston, if i did go back, yes i would stay here. Yes the rooms where small, and needed some TLC, but really - you are not spending much time there. it was clean, and the staff was friendly and sure did do everything to make sure you where enjoying your stay. try to avoid the rooms that back the elevator...very noisy and that's because this hotel is hopping busy and people moving about all the time....the drunks walking thru the pool area at 3am are inconsiderate, so pool view is good,....just maybe try 10th floor or higher. So to the staff i say, ""MAHALO NUI LOA and job well done"", especially to Bria, who helped us straighen out the reservation that the hotel booking company messed up on. Yup, thats right,...arrived at the hotel about 9pmish, and they did not have our reservation. They put us up for the night as the reservation desk was closed but she was to tenacious to let it go and discovered the hotel booking company had faxed our info to their boutique hotel.

Lost the beach area out front as they started beach reconstruction in january and we booked in december :( so that was bad timing,,,,but they were done by the end of our vacation !! and it will be well worth staying there now as they do have a beautiful beachfront and sunset views are spectacular.

We had a partial ocean view room that was small for 3 adults and a 3 yr old so my mom called the desk and asked if they had something bigger. They upgraded us to a JR suite for a small daily fee. We really enjoyed the bigger area for the 4 of us. I didn't have the same feel as some recent reviewers about the loudness and such. I have no complaints about the room except the tub drained slowly and one day it was fixed without contacting anyone. The service folks did a great job working around our napping the little one and so forth and serviced the room when we were away. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for no frills, no room service type stay as a value for your dollar. The breakfast was a pretty good spread compared to some continental breakfast offerings. Plenty to choose from and a hot something if you are in need of that.

It is not in the center of waikiki but down towards the end which made it less busy and still within walking distance to all the shops and resturaunts and of course you cross the street and there is the beach which was awesome. However I do recommend traveling to the North shore and scouting out those beaches they are less busy and gorgeous. My favorite beach was Lanikai towards the end traveling back from the North Shore. The Honolulu zoo is right next door to this hotel which is nice for the kids we have a 5 year old and took him. The breakfast by the pool was nice, although it does get old after a couple days of eating the same fruit and danishes, you get a cooler and can take as much as you like so that helps with snacks throughout the day since food is so expensive, so can't really complain. Wolf gang pucks is right below in the hotel which had good food. All in all I would definately stay again in an oceanfront room thats the only way to go!

The rooms are extremely small just the bedroom, very small balcony with one chair and small table and a very small bathroom with a shower in the bath. There are no tea making facilities which is typical of American accommodation so we rung housekeeping and they bought us up a Kettle only. We went to a ABC shop bought a couple of mugs at $ 2.49 each and amenities/milk, problem fixed but what a welcome gesture it would have been if they provided this. Breakfast starts at 6.30 so if your on a early tour you will probably miss out, like the Oahu Grand circle island tour, pick up is 6am and no they won't cater for people on early tours. Apart from this, you get a small cooler bag and once they open up its a free for all with people rushing everywhere in a disorderly conduct (incase they miss food), all pastries, yoguat, cereal, sushi, tea/coffee/juice etc and then you are free to eat where ever. We sat over at the beach which was more enjoyable than sitting around a small pool with lots of other people breathing down your neck.The next disappointment is no WI-FI in the room unless you want to pay the $10 per day ""amenity fee"", what a joke in 2012!!! I overheard a guest ask for the Wi-Fi to be on for just a few days of their holiday and they were told in no uncertain terms, you either pay the $ 10 per day for your entire stay or go without. They do have Wi-fi in the pool area if you like no privacy and they also have a number of computers where you can pay by the minute for internet usage.Then another disappointment, the room safe, yes there is one, but you have to pay $ 3.00 per day to have it operational. Totally disgusted by now and not a good start the the 2nd half of our holiday.At least this room was cleaned daily and the bed was so comfortable and KS at last.Expedia Tours has a desk in the lobby and are very good, would recommend them but you can get cheaper rates for some things along Kalakaua Ave, if you have time check out your options first but we were on limited time and wanted to get our tours booked. We were also happy with Expedia when in Maui.Its also worthwhile walking around and checking out all the various restaurants rather than just staying within the hotelOne good thing about this hotel was the location, at the end of the strip next to Honolulu Zoo but one last whinge the beach was being reclaimed when we got there, but I assume it will be great once works finish. The other end of Waikiki beach is very popular and much more busy so we were happy with the location to shops, restaurants and a great walk.Would we go back to Honolulu definitely, would we stay at the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel again, definitely not, buyer beware.

Absolutely loved the location as it was easy to walk to everywhere in Waikiki. We liked being right across the street from the beach. The hotel rooms are clean. Bathroom is dated and tiny and musty smelling. The beds are super comfy. Didn't notice any bed bugs, although I didn't look too hard. I did have a couple of bites, but easily could have been from being outside. The first room we stayed in had too small double beds. We phoned to see if we could switch to a room with a king size bed (which I requested when I booked). We were able to switch the next day with no trouble. Also wanted to change rooms as the balcony door did not close/lock and the air conditioner does not work unless the balcony door is latched. Our second room was much better and seemed bigger and we had a better view of the ocean (on 20th floor). Our flights left late in the evening so they gave us an extra hour to check out and they stored our luggage for the afternoon.The breakfast worked great for us as we usually have cereal,yogurt and fruit for breakfast anyways. Although it did get kind of boring after a while. Tiki's is fun...good music and drinks. Wolfgang's express was convenient too and had good pizzas.We did not like that you had to pay for internet and room safe and local calls ($1/call even toll free). Housekeeping did not come for two days. We exchanged towels with the maid in the hall while he was cleaning another room (at his request).Although not a fancy hotel by any means, it served its purpose. Safe and clean and great location. We would probably stay here again as the price was good and we saved money by not having to buy breakfast. Lots of homeless people line the street along the main street in Waikiki. None of them seemed to bother anyone, although it seemed a little sketchy at night.Definitely go to Duke's for supper...best meal ever!The expedia desk was very handy for booking tours and most tours picked up right on the corner or down the street. This worked great for us as we did not rent a car.",Saskatoon,"DeeZeeSK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saskatoon</strong>",2,3.0

As usual a bit of balancing of feedback did the trick, most comments on this hotel are positive, mixed with a lesser amount of negative. So we went with the majority and feel we got it right, we were very pleased with our choice.Sure it isn't 5 star but if that's what you want you need to go down the street a bit and spend much more money.We got good value for money in our opinion, we had an oceanfront room on the 14th floor, the room was larger than many hotel rooms we've had, the bed was great and the view was expansive with no shortage of activities and scenery to take in both day and night.The lift system was very good and we were happy with the breakfast experience, and while we never went down early we always got everything we wanted as the choices were constantly being restocked.We walked to and up Diamond Head and back again, and visited the Memorial at Pearl Harbor twice, a very sad and moving experience but so well set out, a great tribute to all those brave souls.We really enjoyed our 8 days here before moving on to Maui and would happily stay here again when we next return to Hawaii.Mahalo to all the staff at the Aston.","Hamilton & Waikato Region, New Zealand","Melnp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamilton &amp; Waikato Region, New Zealand</strong>",34,5.0

Good food, drinks, and service. Prices high like anywhere there in Waikiki. The pool always seemed to be clean, but no hottub. The breakfast everymornig was nice, but after a couple of days had to go somewhere else because I got tired of pastries and bread.

It's at one end of Waikiki and only steps from the beach and the Honolulu zoo. Easy walking distance to shops and restaurants.The hotel room was small but comfortable. Had a fridge which was convenient. The lanai had a great view of the beach. You could watch surfers at surfer school in the distance, beautiful sunsets, and just enjoy the view.The elevators only work with your room key. I never did figure out how to get down to the ground floor from my room. I always had to go to the lobby level and then take the escalator down the last flight. Not a big deal.Breakfast was a normal continental. It's true that you take you blue cooler down, fill it up, and go on your way.I walked to Diamondhead crater from the hotel...about a mile, then walked up the crater, then walked back.

The decor is a bit dated but the rooms are clean and the bed were very comfortable. We were on the 6th floor just above the bar and we were not disturbed by the bar entertainment at night as this finished by midnight anyway, it was much cheaper to sit on the balcony enjoying the entertainment drinking our own drinks. The views were everything we expected and it is really useful to have the various takeaways underneath as eating out can be quite expensive. I was surprised about the amount of homeless along the main Waikiki Beach walk but they didn't trouble us at all. The ABC stores, of which there seems to be at least 1 every 5ooyds, operate a scheme where you save all your till receipts and if you reach a certain total you qualify for a free gift - the more you spend the better the gift!! The bus stop and Trolley stop is outside the hotel and not very expensive, the ding ding of the trolley buses do tend to disturb any mid day siesta's or lay ins but you soon get used to them and who wants to waste a moment in such a fabulous location as this. The hotel provide a cool bag to fill for your breakfast and also have a drinks machine in reception with tea, coffee or juice dependant on the time of day but there are not always cups available, we found it useful to take our own thermos cups so we can take back to the room safely. The lifts are slow at breakfast due to the amount of people taking their food back to the rooms.","Plymouth, Devon","nannynik</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Plymouth, Devon</strong>",6,4.0

I get that it's sea side and this can happen but my husband has asthma so no way could we stay in this room. They were very courteous and changed our room right away. The new room was great but was on a lower floor so the canopy of the hotel entrance blocked the view, unfortunately there wasn't anything else available and we didn't feel like being very pushy so we just took it. It was just too bad because it wasn't worth it to pay extra in the end for sea side. Word of advice: if you're getting a sea side room make sure it's not on the low floors.Despite this kinda rough start the rest of our stay was fantastic. The breakfast was really good (get there early!) which we often took in our little coolers (provided by the hotel) to eat on the beach. The staff was very friendly and helpful at every opportunity (let us borrow towels after hours sometimes! we returned them I promise :) ). Their hospitality desk helped us book some super fun adventures on the island. The room we ended up with was very clean and comfortable. We were there for just over a week and it began to feel like home. We don't drive and this hotel was also at a really ideal location. There's a bus stop right in front that is serviced by numerous routes to take you anywhere you need to go (we even went to the North Shore). We did visit the zoo across the street which was fun. Despite it being a busy stretch of beach the snorkeling just out front of the hotel was really good. It was at the end of the busy strip so you feel like you're part of the action without being too overwhelmed by it. We also went to a lot of really nice restaurants that were all within easy walking distance. Although word of advice on restaurants: don't just go into one, research it first, all the ones we just checked out at the spur of the moment were real stinkers. The Japanese restaurant right at the hotel, Yoshitsune was amazing, we ate there every day. The Aston's restaurant was really good too actually and we enjoyed the nightly entertainment.

The location is quite nice with a great body boarding beach right across the street. The hotel was overall quite nice but the room we had was an ocean front room and it was the smallest room I've ever had for 4 people- the view was fabulous though the balcony was tiny. Barely room for two people. The beds were full size beds, not queens. The worst part was the bathroom had no horizontal surface to set anything on other than the back of the toilet. Try putting in contacts or make-up or otherwise. The breakfast in the morning was just okay. Waffles and omelets were extra- just carbs were included- no protein other than yogurt. No wireless except on the second floor pool deck. Pool was very cold but since you are in Hawaii, we spent 95% of our time on the beach! Overall it was a decent value, but we couldn't wait to get to a bigger room. Strange elevators too- you never punch a button for a floor in the vator. You waive your room card in frotnt and tell it what floor and then it schedules and tells you what elevator to get on.

We booked a partial oceanview room rather than the full oceanfront and had a great view of the ocean...and of the balconies of the hotel next door. Ask for a room on the pool side for a slightly nicer view! $10 daily resort fee for internet, but we were able to decline.Room: Agree with others that the bathroom is small, but it wasn't a problem for us. The rest of the room was a good size, renovated recently with a newer tv and bedspread. The best part of staying here was the daily free breakfast. You get a blue bag to take it to-go, or if you're like me, aid you in grabbing lots of food. The choices are expansive for a free breakfast, including fresh fruit, pastries, cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, and our favorites: miso soup, rice, and kimchee.Location: Located on one end of Waikiki beach, next to the zoo, and directly across the street from the beach. At the time of our trip the stretch of beach in front of the hotel was closed for maintenance. Good restaurants and lots of shopping abound nearby, but this is Waikiki. It is relatively out of the way; good for avoiding some crowds but bad for riding the bus.Transportation: We rode around on the bus for two days and had a rental car for the other two. Diamond Head is about a 5 min bus ride away (45 minutes walking), downtown Honolulu about 30 minutes away, and the airport about 1 hour away (we rode the bus to pick up our rental car at the airport - I don't recommend doing this!). We avoided the hotel parking fee by parking in the zoo ($1/hour, no daily limit) and on Kalakaua street next to the zoo (metered, free at night). These are about a 5-7 minute walk away. The Aston Waikiki Beach, not to be confused with some of the nearby Aston properties, provided us with a great overall experience, though admittedly we weren't in the room much!","Boston, Massachusetts","catero12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",7,4.0

The pool is quite small and was cold, although my kids did swim in it a few times for a short duration. For anyone wondering whether or not to rent a car before they go or last minute while there... you can rent a car at the tour desk and the cars are located right next door at the Marriott.

The standard room is small and if travelling with a family it maybe wise to upgrade to a suite as it was a tight squeeze for a family of 4. The location is good being at the bottom end of Waikiki close to the zoo (you can see the pink flamingos from the open hallways if you're staying on a high enough floor) and we found no trouble walking to the centre of Waikiki. The breakfast is something we have never experienced before. Again for the cost of the accommodation we can't complain and it was a different experience, maybe not for those who are 'not a morning person' as there are lots of people milling about while waiting to find a vacant pool chair to sit at. The pool is small, but then again you have the beach across the road. We found having Subways and Wolfgang Puck restaurants underneath the Aston very handy and good value. If you can budget it into your holiday, consider renting a holiday house for a couple of days on the North Shore. We did that and totally enjoyed the change of scenery that the North Shore has to offer as it is so different to Waikiki. Mind you we did enjoy Waikiki but it was nice to step back in time and totally relax on the North Shore. Renting a car in Waikiki can be difficult if you are travelling in peak season so it is best to book before you arrive. We did find it easier picking up our car in Waikiki after our stay at the Aston rather that picking it up from the airport. Once you get used to driving on the other side of the road (for us Australians!) and the multi lane highways it wasnt too difficult and definitely a good way to see the island at your own pace. Optional extras to try: Horseriding at Happy Trails especially if you have a smaller child as they have the saddles to hold them. Learning to surf at North shore - there's many different schools out there, we tried North Shore Surf Girls and found them good but a little expensive. Though they did have a professional photographer out there on the day and we were able to get a cd of photos from the lesson for only $30.

We decided not to stay on our return a week later and checked in to the Marriot at $30 more and the difference was huge. Don't waste your money on a junior suite as they are not much bigger and I would consider them just a bigger hotel room, no privacy from the lounge area etc.I think most people accept this hotel as they are in hoilday mode.

In all fairness, for those who like a bit more luxury, it isn't a 5 star hotel, but it did offer everything we needed. The location is great! The hotel is at the end of the Waikiki strip, close to the Diamond Head area (great location for a morning run). It is also right across from the beach which is wonderful! Yes, there is a section of the beach area that is currently under construction, but it's not like you have to walk a mile to find the next open beach area...maybe a block (if even). Plus, the fun part of Waikiki is walking down the beach anyway and seeing all the different hotels, etc. So, if you are looking for quiet and remote, you should probably not be staying in Honolulu period (Maui and Kaui are better islands for that). Another nice feature is the breakfast, which offers an assortment of bagels, muffins, doughnuts and fresh fruit. In my opinion, I actually thought they had a generous assortment and they did a good job of keeping it stocked during the breakfast hours. Sure, it is just bagels and pastries, but it's more than what most hotels (even the nicer hotels) offer as part of the hotel stay package. If you want to fill up on eggs, sausage, etc., you may want to find an ihop or a breakfast place for that. We also liked that we could fill up our cooler bag to have snacks the rest of the day. We didn't have any issues with lines or crowds and were there over spring break.There is a Wolfgang Puck and Subway right below the hotel which is nice for a cheaper meal. If you like to do a little exploring, just walk down the street towards the Royal Hawaiian hotel and you will find tons of food options and shopping. Everything is super close together.The only negative feedback I have is that the rooms are indeed small and a bit outdated in style. However, I felt the rooms are clean and the staff does a good job of supplying fresh towels everyday and cleaning the room daily. In all honesty, you are not in your room much anyway and if you plan to be, I would question why when you are in a location as great as Hawaii. Tips:1. Don't rent a car for the entire time - the transportation is very good for getting you around the Honolulu area. It is not worth the daily parking fees that most hotels charge. 2. If you do want to rent a car, I would recommend it only for visiting the north shore and the Kailua beach area. Those are definitely must see areas of Oahu. The shaved ice in the North Shore area is fantastic!3. Bring your walking shoes - everything is pretty close together in Waikiki, but the strip is fairly long and there are lots of things to see, so be prepared to walk.4. The night life is fun for kids and adults. Lots of people doing their little shows on the sidewalks at night time. Yes, there are quite a few homeless people but they won't bother you if you don't bother them. 5. Wear your sunscreen! The sun is intense even if the weather only feels like 75 degrees. Enjoy yourselves! The tradeoff for a less luxurious hotel is worth it if you want to make this a budget trip for you and your family in a place of paradise!","Shakopee, Minnesota","Cbb123456</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shakopee, Minnesota</strong>",14,4.0

Lots of places to eat, drink and shop all walking distance. Shopping trolleys can take you to all the popular places if you don't want o walk.

We had a small table and 2 chairs in the room which we used to eat our breakfast while looking at our ocean view - got breakfast every morning from the buffet downstairs. Yes there isnt a hell of a lot of stuff to choose from but really there is cereal & bread & you can get an omelette if you pay $5. Pool not overly huge but never swam in it - choose to swim in the beautiful calm ocean straight across the road which is protected by the rockwall.Staff helpful & nice.

Very enjoyable stay. Great location, friendly staff, reasonable price, good housekeeping, lots of food choices, shuttles stop at the door. But we have 2 suggestions to management:(One) Please put someone in charge of the pool who sees it as a guest amenity, not just a backdrop to breakfast. The pool is too cold and closes too early. Please consider raising the temperature of the pool and keeping it open to 11pm or midnight. The pool is shaded by the shadow of the building most of the day and stays quite cold. Ice cold, even on hot days. Yes, the beach is right across the street, but after a long day of shuttling to attractions, walking and shopping, some late evening time in the pool would have been fabulous. But no. It is ice cold and closes at 7pm. Why is this? According to the Front Desk staff, the pool is run by the Food and Beverage Department. (Two) Honor your advertised specials. We got somewhat snookered on the ‘4th night free’. We booked and paid the deposit for a 3 night stay. Then we decided to add the 4th night free. But no. They RAISED the nightly rate to give us the 4th night “free”. It amounted to a decreased rate for the four nights, but certainly was not a free night.

Clean, comfortable, large rooms that have been updated over the years. We stayed in a suite with one bedroom and two baths, ocean view. We had a family of five - so we ordered 2 roll away beds that were very comfortable. Small refrig in the room. Hair dryer. Great water pressure in showers. Adjustable thermostat for air conditioning. Two TV's with pay Playstation. Pool - best sun in afternoon. Bfast included free - pastries, yogurt, bagels, cereal, coffee etc. Eggs and waffles cooked on site in pool area for $4-5. For a family, this was a great savings in Waikiki! It is not really bfast on the beach - they just give you cooler bags to fill with food. We put these to great use with our afternoon snacks too. Staff is excellent. Only downside is parking - it is $27 a day. We just parked down Monsarrat Ave for free and walked two blocks. If you park around 5-6p.m. when the beach crowd leaves, you will easily get a spot for the night. Sometimes my husband dropped us off at the hotel with al the beach gear, and went a found a space a few more blocks away. Also, Waikiki is in the middle of the beach restoration project (we were there Mar. 23rd week 2012). Down to the right of our view was construction on the beach. However, the left side of the hotel view is beautiful - so we didn't mind. I was never able to connect to their free Wi-Fi on the 3rd level by the pool. I did not pursue the issue because there were pay per minute internet access on the reception level. I figured we were in paradise and that it wasn't that important to plug in. We would return easily - this was a great experience for my kids - age 9, 13, 17.

First off, hotels in Waikiki are going to be expensive depending on how comfortable the hotel room is and where it is located. Most of the nice hotels will start at $300/night. I was able to get an Ocean Front hotel room at Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel for $200/night. My husband and I had a beautiful view of the ocean. That is one thing you cannot miss when you're staying in Waikiki. You came all the way to Hawaii. Why not enjoy the view? Secondly, the location was excellent. The hotel was right across from the beach and only six blocks away from the International Marketplace. There were plenty of nearby shops and restaurants. You can pretty much find almost whatever you needed. Thirdly, our hotel room was beautiful and comfortable. The AC was quiet and worked perfectly. We had a huge flat screen TV. We also had a safe (with a small daily fee). The bathroom had a bathtub and hair dryer. The hair dryer may not be incredibly strong, but it was handy since I forgot to pack one. The only con was that the bathtub was a little dirty. But we got some cleaning supplies, and my husband scrubbed it good as new. They also vacuum the carpeted floor daily. Our hotel room also had a refrigerator which made it convenient. The hotel also served free breakfast every morning. They included pastries, croissants, mini bagels, fresh fruit, miso soup, hot coffee, cereal, etc. They only charged a small fee for the omelette and waffle. They had a pool and public shower. They had free wifi on the 3rd floor. You could also rent the internet on the public computers. They have three different concierge services. I loved the way how this hotel had so many different services and amenities. The hotel staff was incredibly friendly and responsive. I would not recommend any other hotel in Waikiki.

Don't get me wrong.The place is right across from Waikiki . If you have a room with ocean views you are greeted to the most stunning views ever! Check in was a breeze. The place is a little dated and you don't quite get the feel of a big hotel when you turn up there. Maybe because you arrive on level 1 and reception is on level 3. They claimed to have wifi which I needed to finish off some work but sadly its only available on level three. Which was annoying as I never really found myself there when I needed to work.You can pay nine ninety five for twenty for hours of internet which is fast which I ended up doing.The free breakfast on the beach concept is good in theory I suppose but the poll area is bout really very nice so you can't comfortably sit and eat there. Right or side the hotel the strip of beach is under maintenance so there are diggers Abe dump trucks so you can't really go and enjoy the breakfast at the beach.Maybe once all the work is completed it would be more inviting. Breakfast consists of muffins, danishes, coffee and juice and some fruit.The bar downstairs always had something going on which was great.Live music and entertainment.it seemed very popular..even a few locals seem to hangout there.Overall I was disappointed maybe for the money I paid I was expecting more in terms of the size of the room and value for moneyFor the second part of my stay I am staying at a cheaper place which is more cental, has more in house facilities and is in a better location along the beach strip closer to shops and transport.Of course no view but then the balcony I got with my room was so tiny at the Aston two people couldn't comfortably sit there even.","Seventeen Seventy, Australia","travelfreaks4lyfe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seventeen Seventy, Australia</strong>",54,3.0

Our room, #1429, was an ocean front, king bed room with a balcony overlooking Waikiki Beach. The view was panoramic: uninterrupted ocean view and the balcony was able to accommodate two chairs and a small table. It appeared that the rooms having parallel views would not be nearly as scenic and in our opinion the room was worth the upcharge.The room was spacious and well equipped with effective air conditioning, a mini-fridge that did an excellent job of keeping drinks and fruits cold, and ample closet and storage space. The only complaint regarding the furnishings was that there was no place to store toiletries in the bathroom and we had to put items on the floor. The carpet, furniture and bedding were clean and in very good condition and showed little wear.Being located at the east end of the Waikiki strip (near the zoo), the hotel is in a less congested area (both for foot and vehicle traffic) which was a nice break after visiting the central beach area. The entire Waikiki beach is being “refreshed” meaning more sand is being added, and we were concerned this would be noisy and inconvenient and emailed ahead to the GM, but it turned out that while the beach immediately in front of the hotel is being worked on, you need only walk 100 feet east and the refurbished beach is wide and less busy than that further west. There was no noise to speak of.The breakfast provided was more than adequate. There was mixed, fresh fruit, cold cereals, instant oatmeal, muffins and breads (all fresh) tropical flavored yogurts and several varieties of coffee. There were also waffles available for $3 and Omelets made to order for $5. (We did not care for the orange juice so we went and bought a 1/2 gallon at the grocery store for $6 and kept it in our refrigerator for the week.) You are given a soft sided cooler that is sufficient to hold a six pack of soda or all of your breakfast items if you wish to take them to your room or the beach. In fact, there is often little available room to sit around the pool area where the breakfast is served.The facilities of the hotel are very nice and well kept. The pool does close at 7pm which seems quite early, and the water temperature was quite cold (about ocean temperature). The bell staff was helpful and security at the hotel is adequate. The elevators are key controlled and not nearly as difficult to use as you may read in other reviews- there is always someone on duty to assist if needed.Parking is quite expensive at $27/night. We heard there was cheaper parking elsewhere but were never able to find it and ended up parking for free (after 6pm) at the nearby park. There is also street parking nearby but you have to feed the meters until 6pm at $1.50.hour with a 2 hour max. We had several problems which were technology related. The safe code stopped working after 5 days and had to be reset by maintenance. We were told this was the policy but it was inconvenient as we were locked out. The safe charge is $3/day.Also, the internet in the room in not wireless- they do provide the hook up cable though- but it was a poor connection and had to be adjusted by maintenance.These two items were overall very minor and did not detract from our enjoyment of the hotel. We would definitely stay at this property again.","Chandler, AZ","Solperros</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chandler, AZ</strong>",112,5.0

When we checked into our ""partial ocean view"" room I called the front desk and informed them that I did not see an ocean and there was only a view of the run down apt building next to it.  She pointed out that if you walk into this 3ftx1ft balcony and look through the corner to the right, there was a small view of the ocean....wow!  What a scam!  Sure enough it was there between a few buildings, but what a joke!  U think I'm really going to step out on this 1 ft diameter balcony to look to right and see the ocean???  So, we have 2 double beds and they are full size only and no queen size beds available. I asked about a king with a sofa bed and a roll away, and of course they want to charge more for each day.  I have never been to a hotel that has not accommodated such requests.  This just shows me how cheap of a hotel this is!  We went to breakfast which is 6:30 to 9 am.  It had a decent selection for a continental breakfast but the staff is so rude!  I asked for a cup to get juice for my kids at 9:05 and they guy there says the breakfast ends at 9 and refuses to give me any milk or a cup for juice!  In summary, I would never stay in a such a hotel in the future.  I am very disappointed in their service and their attitude here.  This may be a good, economical hotel choice for kids on Spring break, but not for a family trying to enjoy a relaxing vacation.","Fremont, California","sherpunjabi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fremont, California</strong>",5,2.0

The rooms are comfortable and everyone except the reception desk is very friendly.","Sherwood Park, Canada","Yysguy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sherwood Park, Canada</strong>",125,3.0

Overall the stay was good. We had a room (803) that had a bad smell and was noisy, and staff made arrangements for us to move to another room. In general staff was friendly. The ""breakfast at the beach"" is a joke, they have a buffet that could be improved (bread, muffins, bread, muffins), the fruit didn't seem fresh and we were in Hawaii, where good fruit is abundant. They call it breakfast at the beach because you can take goodies in a bag they provide (which it's a good idea). So if you know that in advance, then you won't be disappointed:) We ended up getting breakfast at the restaurants next to the hotel. The pool is not big and is in between the reception desk and a restaurant, so it isn't a place to relax, because it's more like a walkway with lots of traffic. But considering that the beach is across the street, you probably won't want to spend much time by the pool.The hotel is in a good location.","San Francisco, California","Cecireus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",4,3.0

The tiny balcony overlooking the pool was a bit disappointing size-wise -- barely big enough for one chair, but the view of the ocean and beach were very nice -- even if it was at a bit of an angle. If you want the full-on view, I guess you have to spring for the top priced ocean front room. I got the mid-priced ocean view room -- and I was happy with that for the money -- especially with the AAA discount that I found on their website.Like a few other reviewers, I had a few small nits to pick with the Aston, but overall I got what I paid for -- so no real complaints. I would be tempted to check out a different place next time, though -- no reason to fall in love with 3 out of 5, right?The whooshing of the elevator was audible in the room and a little annoying at times -- as another reviewer suggested, perhaps ask for a room away from the elevators.I guess you either love or hate the free breakfast. I went the first morning -- and I'm leaning more towards the ""hate"" department. It's a ruckus of people cramming whatever they can into the feed bag that they give you. One lady beside me had about a half dozen individual cereal boxes crammed into her purse and was yelling at her daughter to also grab what she could from the donut tray that was just put down before the ""good ones"" disappeared. I guess they would be more in the ""love"" department! I decided not to even bother the next day.The hotel is right across from the beach -- even if the beach is being dug up at the moment, just go fifty yards either way. The hotel is NOT right in the middle of Waikiki -- I have no idea why others say that. It's pretty much the last hotel on the strip -- but honestly no more than a very pleasant walk from pretty much anywhere. So it's location is not really a minus. In fact, if you're up for a good solid three hour walk, figure out how to walk from the hotel to the top of Diamond Head.","Los Angeles, California","stephen90026</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",8,3.0

You cross the street and the beach is there. There is some beach renovation going on, but it's not a big deal - not like the entire beach is closed or anything like that. - Location #2. The hotel is at one end of the shopping strip, so all you do is start walking the length of the ""Broadway"" to get to all the shops.- Expedia travel station is available to show you various excursions ... you can even book it there. e.g. I did the Hanauma Bay snorkeling, highly recommended, $18 round trip transportation with gear - can't beat that. ps. Some of my friends did the Luau, they weren't impressed with that outing - ymmv.- I stayed on the 5th floor, room 520-something. No view of the beach, just a sight of another hotel. I didn't mind, since I had no intentions of staying inside the room except to sleep. Big bonus - no noise! This section is away from all the noise from the Tiki bar and the pool. If you want a view of the beach AND no noise ... it's up to you to figure out.- I had no complaints with the room - looked pretty good in shape. - The breakfast is mediocre, but you should not complain because it's free. If you're a complainer ... please book a stay somewhere else and pay more :) After a few days I went downstairs to eat at other places just to break the monotony.- Plenty of things to do. Zoo, surfing, shopping, catamaran ride, etc. right outside the hotel.- You'll encounter some beggars but they pretty much leave you alone. One 'beggar' in front of McD's had a sign 'poor and hungry for McD's' but was talking to someone on his cellphone.- LuLu's is a great place to eat while looking out onto the beach. On Monday night it was packed with younger people (20's-30's), with a good DJ playing hiphop/techno music. Apparently Monday nights are 'industry nights' where locals go out to have a good time.- I took the public bus 'The Bus' to get to Pearl Harbor. 1.5 hours each way ... the bus stops everywhere. Cheap, but it does take a toll. Might want to check if Expedia has a shuttle service you can pay to get there quicker. ps. Pearl Harbor & USS Arizona is free; Expedia warned I may not get into USS Arizona unless I get there super early - but I had no problems when I got there during the week at 11am.- Diamond Head hiking trail to the top of the mountain - recommended if you are in shape!I came here with a bunch of people to play volleyball.

Maybe plates, utensils, etc would make this more civilized. This is nothing complimentary either. There are coffee, tea, beverages, set up poolside all day (for a price).

It is a big, bustling hotel with a continual stream of new guests and tour groups. For sake of definition, it is a ""hotel"" not a ""boutique hotel"" or ""resort"" - we were expecting a ""hotel"" experience and this is excatly what we got. If you want more of a luxury, sitting by the pool, resort type experience you won't get it here.Here are some points worth mentioning:- our room was clean and tidy. Not huge but spacious enough for two people who spent most of their time out and about exploring O'ahu rather than being in a hotel room. We received fresh towels every day and housekeeping did a great job at cleaning and tidying our room daily.- we had a Patial Ocean View room. Our room overlooked the pool and you could see the beach/sunset clearly from our patio area. The beach view was obscured by diggers and dump trucks, as the beach is currently getting a major upgrade, but this was bad luck in timing and nothing to do with the hotel.- we enjoyed the breakfast. Every morning we filled our blue bag and headed out - we preferred this to sitting around the pool to eat. It is a little hard to get your head around glazed donuts for breakfast but these made a great morning tea treat! - our room was on the 7th floor and we were not disturbed by the band or traffic noise at night. Our room was two rooms down from the lift and it was the ""wooshing"" of the lift going up and down that was more of an issue noise wise (the lifts are simple to use by the way). This settled down after about 10pm but started up again about 6.30am when people started heading down for breakfast.- the location is great. Across the road from the beach and just out of the crazyness of the main strip. The local bus stop is two minutes away and it is a mian pick up area for tours/transit buses.- Tiki's bar and grill next to the pool area was great - we had drinks here every night and a number of meals. The service is excellent and the food lovely. Hold onto your receipt as you get a free Mai Tai if you come back the next night and present your recieipt- we only realised this on our last day!! The herb seasoned fries at Wolfgang Puck Express downstairs were also a food highlight!!!Overall, we would happily come back to this hotel.PS. To any Australians travelling to O'ahu with shopping in mind, a trip to Waikele Premium Outlets is a must! The two hour local bus ride (which is a great experience in itself!) is worth it for the ridiculously cheap bargains.

It's right across the street from the beach. It's close to tons of shops and eateries. The rooms are nice and spacious. There's a fridge but no microwave. I was shocked that you are charged three dollars a day for the safe. I've traveled a lot and never had to pay for a safe. Also you have to pay 27 dollars a day for parking. Wow!! Their continental breakfast is average. But I really liked how they give you a bag and encourage to take it with you if you're heading out for the day. The batteries in my remote were dead when I got there. I called down and they replaced them pretty quickly.Overall, pretty good but I'm not sure if I would return because the parking is so freaking expensive.

We just came back from a 5 day stay at the Aston with a school group of 17 students. The overall impression was average. Breakfast: this is included in the room rate, but BE WARNED, the quality of the food is VERY low (VERY limited healthy options-with the exception of the fresh fruit), and there are so many people at the hotel that the breakfast buffet can be very chaotic and overwhelming at times.There are very few tables to sit at, so on a sunny day, people can be seen by the dozens sitting on beach chairs or in any open space by the pool. THERE IS NO REAL SEATING AVAILABLE FOR BREAKFAST, which now makes sense to me why the hotel advertises ""breakfast on the beach"" so much. They are trying to get the massive amounts of people off the property and across at the beach since they just don't have the capacity for everyone.The one plus side is that they give you a small lunch-bag to stuff with food and take away.Rooms: these were the pretty standard hotel rooms with decent beds, flat screen tv, table and chairs, refrigerator,and safe (that cost a few dollars a day to use). We had the corner room, so we had a great view of Diamond Head and the zoo out our window. If you stuck your head out far enough on the lanai, you could see a glimpse of the ocean. The lanais were small, barely big enough to bring a chair outside and sit on. Pigeons were always hovering as well (In fact, two friendly birds usually walked inside our room when we opened the sliding door).Hotel layout: VERY awkward. There is a reception area on the bottom floor where all the buses and taxis pick up. In the mornings, this area is usually crowded with guests eating breakfast (see my section on breakfast earlier). On the same floor, you'll see ""Wolfgang Express"" restaurant next to a ""Subway"" and ""Coldstone Creamery"". From the bottom floor, you take an escalator up to the main level where the reception desk(s), pool, and restaurant are located. From there, you have to take a separate elevator up to the rooms in the hotel tower. Very awkward setting...by renting out the various areas to restaurants, it seemed to us that the hotel just wanted to make money, while taking away valuable space for seating near the pool/lobby.Overall, the hotel is in a good location in Waikiki. Just in comparison to some of other nicer hotels further down the street (Sheraton, Hilton, etc.), this one was low-average.","Lausanne, Switzerland","Swissbulgarican</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lausanne, Switzerland</strong>",83,3.0

There is a person standing at the elevator (most times) to help out-it's floor specific based on your key. They give you a breakfast cooler and you load up and head out to the beach.
