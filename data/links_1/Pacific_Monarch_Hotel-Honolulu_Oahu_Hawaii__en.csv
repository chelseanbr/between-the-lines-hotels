We loved it here. Yes, it's not the Hyatt or the Four Seasons, but it has everything you are looking for at a reasonable price. My wife and I are pretty selective about where we stay. This place worked. We had a suite on the 29th floor and would recommend to anyone that they try and get a higher room and an '02' room (any room that ends in 02). Separate bedroom, small living room, full kitchen with stove/oven, M/W double sink. and adequate bathroom. The best of this room however was the Lanai, the deck, the balcony. We could access it from either our bedroom sliding doors or through the living room. It's huge - we had seven people on it. it has a GREAT view of the ocean. It gets morning sun and partial afternoon sun. You can move around to get sun or shade throughout the day. We spent a LOT of time on the lanai. It's also private, you cant hear or see any of your neighbors in the building. We loved this lanai a lot and you will too. Other amenities in the building? Beach towels, nice pool on the roof. Location is about 200 meters from the beach. Staff is excellent. Place was clean and cleaned well daily. We had very good service from Danny and Rose. We'd recommend Pacific Monarch and would stay here again next time we're in Waikiki.","St. Albert, Canada","DonW322</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Albert, Canada</strong>",6,5.0

It is two short blocks from the beach. Other than that it is just a plain-jane hotel, which makes the ""resort fee"" a joke. There is a cafe and a restaurant there but neither have a view of the ocean or beach. We didn't eat at either one. The rooms were clean but the last renovation was done somewhat sloppily. The furniture was pretty beaten up. Scratches and water spots were common in all three rooms.

Last time in Hawaii Four years ago, we opted for a more expensive hotel but in hindsight we realised that it was money wasted considering how much time we spent in our room. The Pacific Monarch is a middle-of-the-road place to stay; not the flashiest in Waikiki, nor is it a budget motel. We found the rooms comfortable and clean and, depending on what floor and options you pay for, had a good view of our surroundings including the beach. The service from the friendly staff was fantastic and we were made to feel very welcome during our stay. The rooftop pool and spa was nice in case you wanted a quick dip instead of heading for the beach, and the panoramic views from the roof was a bonus too. Nothing is perfect and our only gripe was the noisy window mounted Air Conditioner next to the bed, but other than that, I could not fault the place.

We booked a Partial Ocean View room. These rooms have a queen bed, super comfortable, a lounge that can convert to a double bed if required. There is a kitchenette with everything you would want. A table and four chairs fit nicely into this room. Our room was in the 18th floor and we saw a little ocean from our Lani. You can’t sit on the Lani but the sliding doors open along the length of the room giving it an airy feel. We used the ceiling fan rather than the air con that blew a bit of dust when we turned it on. The fan and open doors were adequate even with the record temperature that Waikiki experienced at that time. The rooms are serviced daily by very friendly staff. Everyone we came in contact with make you feel not only welcome but like returning family. The location of the hotel is perfect, not even a 5 min walk from Waikiki Beach. An ABc store is about 2 mins away for all items you would need. Sadly the local Foodland store has recently closed so we made the trek to Walmart for grocery items for the two weeks, a little cheaper than the abc store. The Resort Fee entitles you to beach chairs, beach towels, newspapers daily and a weekly reception on the roof top area with other holiday makers and residents.

When we arrived the receptionist said there was nothing available but they would check us in after an hour. Little did we know that this was when our nightmare started at this place. After waiting and waiting and with no concern and communication to us at all they checked us in at 1pm. No hospitality there at all or any apology. They just didn't care at all. I even begged and pleaded with them as my feet had ballooned to double the size because of the pregnancy and the long flight but they just couldn't be bothered with us at all.Secondly, the online pictures do not look like anything in real life. Just a run down hotel with very dated and yucky toilets. The TV's in the rooms are from the 70's and with the noisiest ceiling fan you can imagine.

Imagine coming back from a vaction more tired than when you left because of lack of sleep.Thirdly, the reception is always under staffed and they are always overwhelmed so usually customer service is compromised because they are just trying to get through the day.It was always a very unpleasant wait at reception if you needed anything because they would always be busy.Lastly, the pool area is disgusting and dated. It looks nothing like the pictures online. What a waste. We had to go to a neighbour hotel and pay to swim there because this pool was disgusting with old dated furniture. ""Yuck"".Honestly this is the worst $3000 i have spent in my entire life. The whole holiday just ended up being a dump because the accommodation was very very bad.

Woke up one morning to the power being off but when we returned it was back on. No big issue for us. They have three lifts and two of them broke down for the last three days. There were lines all the way through reception, trying to get to the roof for the pool took an hour and forget it if you were trying to get back to your room after 9pm. The frustrating bit was communication on the lifts being down unless you went down to reception and saw the signs. I understand things break but a call or even a sign on every floor would have helped. The roof top pool and spa was pretty cool to watch the Friday fireworks from heads up the spa button is around the corner . Parking isnt owner by the hotel. its $30 a day but it’s literally connected to the hotel and super easy to access. Make sure you put extra tape on the ticket or you will get towed.

The entire hotel may need money spent on it to spruce it up a bit, but our room was very clean and comfortable.

Glad we came back. Exceptionally friendly staff all around. The room was very clean. The kitchen dishes, small appliances, coffeemaker, toaster, rice cooker, microwave, kitchen utensils were spotless. The bed/ pillows were to die for perfect, super comfy. We like this hotel as it is one block from Waikiki beach between Kuhio and Kalakaua streets (the two main roads) and is so central to everything. Once you get to the top floor of the hotel you will find the spacious amenities room. Living room sofas with TV, sm. kitchen, sink, fridge & 8 sets of tables with 4 chairs each. The spectacular roof top pool requires you to walk up another flight of stairs. There is no elevator to get to the rooftop pool. Our room on the 32nd floor had a 1 foot balcony only, (but had large sliding glass doors that opened up all the way providing a wonderful tropical breeze) so if a balcony with furniture is important to you verify that in your reservation. When you check out, if you have a late flight, the hotel will hold your bags. They will graciously give you a key allowing access to use the amenities room, shower room and pool (ask for pool towels if you need them).

Great location, walking distance to everything. Reception staff have always been friendly. Housekeeping this year needs improvement as they often knock at 8.30am to do our rooms. When we asked why this early, they complained they have too much rooms to do!The biggest bonus was the free shuttle to Ala Moana, and the friendly shuttle driver, Earl, who gave us tips on where to shop, times etc. The hotel didn’t have a concierge and reception staff did not know much about what’s going on the island for tourist tips. Earl was a treasure!Our 1st room had a big locked pantry which made it difficult to get around the room but reception quickly moved us elsewhere. It seems that some people own the condominiums and get them rented out but leave their things there. The hotel should do something about this.

It is very close to the beach. There is a great supermarket nearby called The Food Pantry. Groceries are very expensive in Oahu as everything is imported, eg. bread = $8, milk = $4, half a dozen eggs = $7! There are loads of stores called ABC stores around too where you can pick up various bits you might require. Just before you come to The Food Pantry, there are some wonderful food wagons with outdoor seating. Food is great & cheap. We actually ate there 4 nights for dinner, we liked it so much. Our favourite was the Blue Water Shrimp & Seafood wagon. We both got steak there one night. It was served with rice, sweetcorn & salad. It cost $30 for the two meals & it was one of the nicest meals we had on out trip. The hotel is clean & all the staff are very friendly. Beach towels are supplied for guests to bring to the beach. The bed was comfortable & the kitchen was well equipped. Cleaning staff serviced the apartment everyday. Lovely refreshing lemon water is available in the lobby. The pool area is nice. The air conditioning in the apartment is not good though. It is EXTREMELY loud & it doesn't really cool the room. I was used to the noise by the end of the week but it does sound like a jumbo jet!! The room was so hot. The fridge also wasn't great either, it froze everything we put in it, including the milk!We were looking for a late check out on the day of departure as we had an evening flight but the hotel could only give us an extra hour. I was a little bit disappointed with this as I have never been refused a late check out before. I don't mind paying for late check out. It worked out ok in the end though as the hotel has a hospitality lounge with shower facilities beside it. The hotel also minded our luggage so could go to the beach for the afternoon & enjoy our last sunset on Waikiki beach (which is amazing by the way).

Arrival was fine with our apartment being ready despite our early flight. The reception staff member was really lovely and the process was efficient. Our day unfortunately went downhill when we saw the room. I was crushed. WE were allocated a room on the Penthouse Floor. Unlike the other rooms, our room was behind a separate door that led to two apartments. The apartment was horrible. The only plus side was that it was two bedrooms but the main bedroom was so hot that it was almost unusable as there was only a small fan. The bathroom was worse though. It was honestly a death trap. I don’t know how they can rent out an apartment with that sort of shower. It was clear that the space had previously had a large hot tub in it. The hot tub was long gone but rather than Reno the bathroom, it looked like it had been converted to a shower even though the pipes were still sticking out from the previous plumbing. To make matters worse, you had to climb up a step ladder to get in and out of the shower. It was unbelievably dangerous to have to do that in a wet space. I also had to clean the entire apartment on arrival as it was filthy. To the absolute credit of the staff, they were very accomodating with our request for a room change. We spent the first night feeling miserable and worries about our kids using the shower but the rest of the week was great. Our new room was exactly like the pictures (the first one was nothing like what I expected), and we really loved the location of the hotel. Staff were friendly and the pool area was great. You really can’t beat the location due to the proximity to the beach. Our apartment also had a fantastic view and a lovely big balcony with a table and chairs for outdoor dining. Everything in the second apartment was clean and in good working order.

Ours was on a lower floor and there was plenty of mould on the curtain linings, the bathtub was cracked and the aircon was old, needed earplugs to sleep through and was not up to the job of cooling the room on a hot summer day. Louver windows, normally not visible behind curtains, hadn't been cleaned in a while. Other than those areas the room was clean and the beds comfortable. A balcony was only about 2 foot wide and unfurnished. On the plus side, there was a full kitchen including a proper oven, and the hotel was two blocks from the shore. We arrived on an early flight and were able to use a communal sparsely furnished area on the top floor to get changed and repack for the day until our room became available. There are free shuttles to the Ala Moana shopping center. Ours took half an hour to arrive and took another 25 minutes to get there via a very circuitous route. But still, free. Rooms 6 and 7 on each floor face the city and are likely noisier, especially on floors below 10. Everything on Waikiki is very expensive and this isn't the only property in the area that benefits from the popularity of the location and limits investment to maximise profit. Found the staff extremely helpful and friendly and the chap at reception remembered my name despite having met us only once the day before, which was impressive. Transport advice was good. Overall, OK for a night but we would not be back for a longer stay and would probably avoid Waikiki as the value for money proposition isn't that great.

Worth the upgrade to the partial oceanview due to the view (otherwise you are looking at other buildings/ the road!) and the balcony which is a great size. The lead in rooms have tiny balconies. The air con is noisy but we only used it when we went out to make the room cold. The pool is nice. They have a spa too. View from the pool deck is lovely. Bathroom is an ok size.We were only on the 9th floor but didnt find road noise too excessive. Sure theres a bit as you are in the city so its to be expected.Pretty much its not 5 star fancy but you wouldnt expect it for the price. I think its the pick of the bunch in that price range.

The type that penetrates your dreams, wakes you up, stops.... and then just as you manage to drift off it starts up again (rinse, repeat, all night long).At about 4am the delivery trucks on the street outside start working and despite being on the 17th floor it sounded as if we were right down on the street with them. The air conditioner is about 20 years old and also noisy. So no, we didn’t get any sleep AT ALL. When we checked in we were told that we were there on their ‘cocktail reception’ night. So we headed up to the ‘hospitality room’ and found a run-down looking room with guests sat around a boom box. ‘Appetisers’ were a bowl of chips, some unpeeled carrots and some grapes. The ‘cocktail’ was a plastic cup of sprite with a slice of orange. The rooms are dated, filthy and noisey. The lifts stop at every single floor (30 something).

The water was lovely and hot, there was an abundance of towels and the cleaners visited every day. Wi fi was ok, it could be a little slow at times, but hey we're on holiday so no rush! The bed was comfortable and we slept well, despite the sounds of the city. As other reviews have noted, the biggest selling point for this hotel is the location. A short walk to the beach and all the main attractions of Waikiki, it's just fab. The resort fee included the safe, pool towels, wi fi, DVD hire and a shuttle bus to a nearby shopping mall - we didn't take advantage of this so can't comment.

Check in was nice and simple and as I had booked direct all of the extra items promised with a direct booking where present and accounted for. For myself coming from Australia we don’t have “amenities fee” but I was well informed when I did my booking so this did not bother at all as I had already accounted for the fee during the booking process.I found all the staff whom I had interactions with present, helpful and approachable. Overall great customer service. Housekeeping standards were of a high standard and room was clean and fresh. A side note some of the furniture in the room is a little outdated but seeing as I was in Hawaii I didn’t really send that much time in my room.The best part about aqua pacific is the location. Central Waikiki is going to be noisy there is no getting around that but when you are a 5 minute walk from beach, restaurants,bars and shopping it balances out well. My one other note is that the Aqua Pacific unlike some larger chains was super secure As there are no bars/ restaurant s located beyond the front desk you required a room key to get past the front desk area and as a solo female traveller this particular aspect really appealed to me.I would absolutely stay at the Aqua Pacific again!","Bayonet Head, Australia","GoPlaces690135</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bayonet Head, Australia</strong>",1,5.0

The A/C is a built in unit which was rather loud, but I never used it. I just opened the balcony door and let the cool air in (it is not that humid/hot in January) and left it ajar when I was out and that was good enough. At night, I just used the ceiling fan in the bedroom. The hotel itself is very clean and the staff very friendly. No need to book a hotel at the Hyatt or other posh hotels which will costs you more $$$. They provide beach towels and beach chairs and a shuttle to the Ala Moana mall. All this is included in the daily amenity fee of $20. The hotel has a Japanese café and a restaurant which are both very good and at reasonable prices. Across the street you can get a poké bowl and Korean BBQ. Not only is the hotel very good but the location is top notch! The hotel is just minutes away from the beach and walking distance to the main strip and is situated on Kuhio Avenue where there’s lots of small restaurants, takeout places and food trucks. I would recommend to eat here and not at those fancy restaurants on the main strip to save money. The only negative is that the laundry facilities could be better. They only have 3 washers and they are rather old. I think they should invest in updating the washers. It costs $3 each to wash and dry.

We arrived on a 6am flight and were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready for us when we arrived in Waikiki although it wasn’t the room we had booked and we were moved the next day to a one bedroom with twin beds as per our booking. The view from the 24th floor is spectacular although the balcony got quite windy at times. We could see the sea, city and Diamond Head.Location to Waikiki Beach and the views are the best features of this hotel. The beachfront is a 2 minute walk. The apartment is compact, decor is quite nice if a little outdated, kitchen facilities were good, but the bathroom is tiny and the sofa smelt stale. Our toilet blocked several times, but it was dealt with quickly each time. Rooms were serviced daily.Laundry facilities are on level 3, 2 out of the 4 washing machines were out of order during our stay which was a bit frustrating.The rooftop pool is nice to get away from the crowds at the beach. The pool is small and warm and there’s a spa too. Again all a bit dated, but the 360 degree views are spectacular. Beach towels were provided at reception which is always handy. Staff were friendly and helpful at all times and I believe reception is open 24 hours.There is a courtesy bus which runs to Ala Moana shopping centre each day, every half an hour.To sum up, perfectly acceptable accommodation in a fantastic location, everything on your doorstep.Thanks Aqua Pacific.","Newcastle, NSW","silverjan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle, NSW</strong>",6,3.0

It end up being a big disappointment. I’ll start with the good parts: 1) location is what you pay for. It’s close to the beach, and there are plenty of restaurants and shops within the walking distance. 2) their queen size bed is bigger than a normal king size bed. 3) most staff are nice. The biggest deal breaker for me is the noise of this hotel. We live in the 23 floors and shut all the windows. We could still hear the noise from the street, e.g. cars passing, bus stopping, and people laughing from the street. The hotel sent someone to check the room, and they said the windows was shut properly and every room in the hotel is like this. If you mind noise, STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL. Problem #2: they only have one type of pillow, which is very tall for me. Most hotels I stayed at have at lease one high and one low pillow to choose from. If you don’t like their only pillow option, you’re out of luck. Other small problems: 1) When I called the front desk, they don’t seem to know where I’m calling from (inside or outside of the hotel, not even mentioning knowing about the room number). I thought hotels at this price would already have a system in place. 2) There were times when I called the front desk, I felt they were rushing to hang up the phone. I asked questions like “do you have rooms with queen size bed available for tonight”, and the front desk said he doesn’t know. I found it hard to believe. 3) They make the system unnecessary complicated. I got room keys, towels keys and dvd rental keys. You need the towel keys to exchange for clean beach towels at the front desk. 4) there’s no salt or cooking oil in the kitchen, which I thought were the basic condiment for a kitchen. The hotel is old and simple, which I don’t mind. But the noise and their only pillow option will make me not to come back again.

The staff on arrival were extremely friendly and polite and explained all the services that were available with the ""Amenities Fee"" - Shuttle to Alo Moana Shopping Mall, DVD Rental, Beach Towel and Chairs and a list of other things. They also clearly explained about the parking which we didn't need but was good to know just in case we kept our rental car overnight. When we checked in there were only rooms with single beds but the lady was very helpful and contacted us to advise that there would be a queen room available a few days later and we were moved to that room which was great. The view was fabulous from the room, we had two rooms and each on different sides of the building, one with a great sunset 2306 and the other of the ocean and diamond head 3207. During our stay we were well accommodated in the room with the amenities, the aircon can be loud but it didn't disturb us when sleeping, comfortable beds and clean bedding, the rooms are serviced daily but floors aren't cleaned daily as we had sand in one area that remained the whole stay. From what I could gather the apartments are privately owned by individuals and serviced by the Aqua Group so they all have a different look and the upkeep is quite different as well i'm guessing based on what the owner has been prepared to do with their property. The kitchen cabinets in room 2306 could do with a bit of renovating whereas the ones in 3207 were quite new so for that I can't fault the hotel as I think they are doing a great job with what they have. The location is FANTASTIC, a short walk to the beach front, two ABC stores nearby and a Food Pantry in short distance for snacks and drinks and so close to all the restaurants. Just when we were leaving a North Shore Food Truck had opened on Kuhio Avenue also a very very short walk that I suggest you try and across from the hotel there is a ME BBQ little restaurant which has breakfast at a great price and the food is delicious.

Staff were very professional very friendly very informative of the facilities within the hotel and surrounding area. Our room was very spacious well equipped. We had a great view from the ocean from our balcony. Unfortunately the balcony has no outside seating as it's very narrow so really didn't get to appreciate that view unless you stood there for a long time. The hotel is going. Through renovations at the moment. The hotel inform you days and events if any of the upgrades are to effect with notices in the left and around the hotel. The security is very good you need your room key to swipe in to get to the left or anything external doors leading out to the laundry or to the car park. The hotel is only two blocks away from the beach great location for families and people that just want to relax on the beach. There is also a rooftop pool small but ideal for those who really don't like the beach which is only two blocks away. There are lots of restaurants and bars a short walk from the hotel. The hotel has one restaurants and cafe within the grounds which cater for the Japanese tourist or anybody that likes Japanese food,"Byford, Australia","S405CFianm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Byford, Australia</strong>",13,5.0

The location is really great within an easy 2 to 3-minute walk of the Waikiki Beach. There are lots of things to do with easy reach of the hotel. Ok that's enough... The hotel condo rooms are really showing their age with very average furnishings, poor air conditioning (had to buy a small fan from Walmart just to circulate the air in the room). Bathroom was really average and dirty with poor quality and partially working faucets. The hotel was also found with 'questionable' residents as we found some of them handcuffed and being taken out of the hotel elevator by the local cops. And just to completely stuff up our stay at the hotel, our rental car was towed away, even though we had purchased a 2-hour parking ticket that was placed on our dash. Despite paying the $10 parking fee and despite the car being parked within the allowable time period, the car was towed away because the scamming tow company personnel said they couldn't see the parking ticket so they towed my vehicle. It cost me $35 in a taxi fare to go and collect my car, plus $227 (in cash - only) for the towing and storage fees. When I got to the tow company, I opened the car and found the parking ticket on my seat (obviously moved during the tow). When I showed them that I had a legitimate parking ticket, they didn't give a stuff and just said that their representative couldn't see the ticket so the car was towed. This is absolutely bull#$%! and I was so disappointed because I had to pay the $227 to get my car released from their impound. This has never happened to me anywhere else in the world during the many years of international business and leisure travel. So a small warning: if you want to stay in a really average hotel and if you intend on hiring a car and having it towed away for no reason whatsoever, then come-along and stay at the Aqua Pacific Monarch Hotel.You'll be glad you did!!!Alternatively, find some where better to stay, because as long as people stay here and put up with this sort of crap, then nothing will change. Only when there are no residents coming to the hotel and no one parking their cars in the hotel car park, will cause the hotel management do something to fix these issues.","Melbourne, Australia","DJaaayyy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",26,2.0

We got a great deal and split up into two city view rooms. You could peer around for a glimpse of ocean, but mostly we were looking out on the time warp that is Waikiki... which was actually kind of cool. Brady Bunch and Elvis came to mind. Rooms were fine. Beds pretty comfortable. Small kitchenette and giant sliding doors that made the room feel larger. Each room had a pull-out sofa and plenty of space as hotel rooms go. We had two rooms separated by the elevator bank. Initially, I was worried about the noise, but there was not issue. One the 8th floor there was some street noise, but I didn't find it disruptive.The location is ideal. A block from Waikiki beach. There's a surf shop on the next corner where my son rented boards every day. The surfers were right in front of where we entered the beach, as were some hula shows. Shops and restaurants are all around and steps away. I liked that we were nestled in a corner of old school Waikiki, but a block or so away from high end shops and restaurants.Two setbacks for us were the $30/day parking and the fact that the rooftop pool was under construction. I had been repeatedly reassured when I made the reservation that the construction would be finished by the time I arrived and that was not the case. They did give us passes to a neighboring pool, but we had been looking forward to watching the fireworks from up there. Staff was courteous, but there's some room to grow in the customer service arena. I get the impression that they're on the defensive and may regularly deal with ""issues"" that come up.In all, we were happy with our stay.","Westfield, New Jersey","ann r</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Westfield, New Jersey</strong>",144,4.0

For sure higher the room better the view.The room was equipped with a full kitchen, all you need to cook, stove, microwave, dishes, coffe maker, slow cooker. We had a suite with a nice bathroom and balcony around the suite. Rooms were serviced daily, fresh towels, toiletries and cleaned up.Rooms have a noisy old style AC, fridge, safe, TV, playstation and you can borrow games to play if that is what you want to do in vacation. The swimming pool from top floor was closed due to renovations but we got a pass to use the neighbour's pool. The parking below the hotel is a public parking and costs $30 per day. Hotel is in a very good location, 2 blocks away from beach, close to a lot of ABC stores, restaurants, zoo, and aquarium. The staff was not that friendly some how indifferent. They have a shuttle service between Ala Moana mall and hotel but is not so useful, because its unpredictable we lost an hour waiting for this service asking front desk every 10 minutes when is the shuttle gonna be here.

When we checked in we were told by the man at the counter. we were not one of their guests and our contact Mary would arrive soon to show us to our condo. After a solid half hour wait, a woman arrived and said Mary would not be coming, gave us an envelope and said our pool and hot tub are closed, we don't have an ETA, you can guest pass for the Aqua Bamboo next door and use their pool. We took our envelope, got on the elevator and went up to the27th floor. When we opened the door the room was so hot from the heat coming through the windows, it felt as if the heat had been left on. We quickly closed the black out drapes in both units and looked for the control to turn on the A/C. It only took a moment to discover that the advertised A/C is are 2 small window units, one in each condo that sits on the floor in the corner and is vented through the outside. There ceiling fans in the main living area and each bedroom, but the small size A/C units can barely keep up with the heat so the bedrooms, never cool down. The Queen size beds are soft and you roll to the center of them. The 2 couches make into beds and they too are heavily used, you feel the bar and springs while laying on them. They do supply 2 double air mattresses that we discovered. We folded up the sofa beds and used the air mattresses.The unit was not really clean when we arrived. There was not enough drinking cups in either unit to accommodate our group of 7, so we went to the Food Pantry and purchased cups. There are several spots in the condo that have patches on the walls. and 2703 has a hole in the wall. There is also a magnetic bottle opener on the fridge that you can clearly see has poked several holes in the wall when the door to the fridge is opened. I took photos of the damage as I did not want to be accused of doing it. The bathroom is tiny and hot.The view is amazing from 27 floors up, but you are a short walk to the beach, and the area can get a bit sketchy after dark.This was not an easy booking, I had originally booked with Sarah McClendon who transferred it to Mary McClaflin. It took several phone calls. emails etc. to get a confirmation of final payment. After several weeks of attempts to contact, her daughter sent me an email that said, we got your check.

One small hiccup was that we booked 2 singles beds, and a sofa, as was travelling as a party of 3 with my 2 sons. For some reason they had booked us a queen size instead of the singles, but the issue was quickly sorted - so best confirm before you arrive. The location of the hotel was great, we were on the 26th floor, great views of the hills and ocean, our balcony was constantly windy, so we didn't really sit out there, but was good to have the sliding door open for the fresh air. Beds comfortable, maid service very good - clean fluffy towels daily, beds made, toiletries replaced, Air con did not work very well, but with the breeze, wasn't an issue for us. Helpful friendly reception staff, free shuttle handy, public bus stop across the road - $2.50 to Pearl Harbour. We preferred The Food Pantry just down the road over the touristy ABC stores. We liked having the little kitchen in our room as was good to have a full size fridge, and my boys (17 & 22) liked having a lazy breakfast before we ventured out. The pool wasn't open when we were there, due to maintenance, but not an issue, as used the beach & we could of used next doors pool if we wanted.

Good location - just a stones throw from Waikiki beach, many good restaurants nearby. Also great cheap cafe bar onsite.The room was large with Sofa, dining table, wardrobe, kitchenette with microwave, hob and fridge. The kitchen was well equipped for a small studio with toaster, kettle, cutlery and crockery. So easy to do self catering if you want. The shower in the bathroom was strong with plentiful hot water. Clean - the room was cleaned daily. Towels were changed daily and toiletries topped up. Cleaning staff were good and very polite and friendly.Beach towels available for free hire.Lovely free little welcome drink do with snacks on the Wednesday (every Wednesday) at 4.30 pm.Great value for the area for what you get, (but by no means holiday luxury!)Negatives - Some staff at front desk not overly friendly. Only 3 lifts so sometimes you wait a bit, but never more than a few minutes. Room decor - looks like it hasn't been updated since the 70s. Aircon - tucked in the corner by the sofa so not hugely efficient. Balcony - OMG!! Please do not go on the balcony if you've had a drink, or rent this room if you have kids. Very dangerous. The parking is expensive and nowhere else to park nearby. 30 USD a day.Traffic noise - lots of noise from about 6 am onwards. We were on 16th floor.THE WORST..... we were not told anything about building works. These have been ongoing since April and are scheduled till August. I booked only a week before arrival. My main reason for booking the hotel was the rooftop pool and hot tub! All of which CLOSED. We were only told this upon check in. You do get a pass to use a sister hotel's pool, we didn't bother as people we spoke to said it was small and ground level. Really disappointed! There are builders scaling the outside of the building too so beware if you book a room with a view. We met a couple who couldn't go on their balcony and had specifically paid extra for their room. They said there was lots of building rubbish on their balcony and part way through their stay a sign was put up saying not to go on it. No warning whatsoever.So that's my review. I reckon at the price most of the positives outweigh the negatives if you are on a budget, but check the pool is open before you book.Waikiki itself we were disappointed in. It was a bit like Benidorm. Lots of high rise buildings and very commercial, busy traffic. We didn't find people overly friendly. I'd probably stay somewhere Kailua if I'd researched better.A good tip. We missed the fireworks on Friday due to our position on the beach. You must go right along to the far end way past the outrigger. So I reckon the tips saying aim for the beach cafe are spot on. I read on one site you could see the fireworks if your toes were in the sand - absolute rubbish! You can hear them though.","Haywards Heath, United Kingdom","Becaman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Haywards Heath, United Kingdom</strong>",58,3.0

I don't think that it is sound proofed like modern hotels, we were disturbed by garbage trucks etc in early hours. It's location is ideal , just one block back from the Duke on Waikiki beach.

We got a 1 bedroom, small kitchen, partial ocean view room at the Pacific Monarch! It was perfect for us! It is in a great location, 2 blocks from Waikiki beach, several restaurants & shopping all around! We walk everywhere we can!

From the front desk, to housekeeping, & Maintenance, they have become our Ohana (family)! We miss them all! Danny, Daniel, Keiko, Cheryl,& Erica at the front desk! Whatever we need, they will make sure we are taken care of! Always a greeting of ""Aloha"" every day! This coming Feb., will be the 7th year we are returning to the Pacific Monarch! We always make our reservations for the next year, before we return to MN! Whatever type of room you are looking for, they have it, whether you are staying 1 week, or many weeks!

When we first arrived at this hotel we were a little doubtful about how it might shape up.First impressions of the room gave us the feeling that it was rather tired and needed an upgrade.One of the swipe keys didn’t work and this was a continual annoyance throughout our four-night stay.This hotel is very well located to all amenities. We were on the 9th floor and had a one bedroom apartment style room.Our agent had booked a king bed but the bed was only a queen size, but still very comfortable. We had a little balcony access from the bedroom as well as a larger area with a great breakfast table and chairs from the lounge, which was ideal. The view wasn’t all that spectacular as we looked to the apartments in the next building and down onto Kuhio Avenue. The kitchen and lounge area was quite roomy with a very good tv and free wifi.The staff were very friendly and the service was excellent. They have an arrangement with a daily free shuttle service operating every half hour or so to take you around the city, and drop you off wherever you wished, and picked you up from the drop off point back to the hotel. That is a great service.The apartment had a microwave, kettle, coffee machine, large full-size fridge, and ample cutlery with plates and saucers. Coffee, sugar or creamer were always on hand.One thing that we really liked was the Paya brand soaps and shampoos. We tracked down the manufacturer and had some imported back to Australia. So refreshing and smelt like the islands.It’s just one block off the main beach and a little older than the flashier establishments, but we would recommend to anyone.When we hit mainland USA next year, on the way back we’ll book the Aqua Monarch Pacific again and ask for a room higher up, facing the beach.","Tamborine, Australia","Schanuzer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tamborine, Australia</strong>",83,4.0

Whilst I appreciate that we were given a bigger room with a better view, it was disappointing that we couldn’t actually have our blinds open for most of the day as the hotel is having construction done to it, and as a result work men are constantly moving up and down outside your room. We were warned about this at check in however it was not disclosed at the time of booking, which would have made us consider changing hotels. It was annoying to know that you had paid a lot of money to stay in a better room with a view…but couldn’t enjoy it without giving up your privacy. The kitchen was great! Allowed us to save some money by having some of our meals in the room. Bed was a bit too hard for our liking but the rest of the room, and bathroom was really good. As part of the USD18 a day resort fee, you get use of the free shuttle bus that runs between the Aqua hotels to Ala Moana, which was extremely handy, as the shuttle arrives every 30 minutes. In addition to the shuttle service, the hotel gives you a movie rental card which allows you to rent some movies and PS3 games from the roof top. This was a really unexpected and enjoyable aspect of our stay. Because my partner was sick with the flu for 2 days it gave him some entertainment.Even though we were on the 13th floor (room 1302) next time I will be requesting a room on a higher level as you cannot sleep with your windows open at night because of the amount of nice coming from the street level. This was annoying because the aircon does not work very well, and I would strongly suggest that the hotel look at upgrading them. I would stay at this hotel again but would double check first to see if any construction was going on first. I would also strongly insist on having a room on the higher floors.","Sydney, Australia","Shazba_25</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",16,4.0

Upon arrival, I check in and after payment when I asked about the parking I get a long speech about how it isn't theirs, they are really strict, if you run your card twice it charges twice, it is in their building but nothing to do with them. Fine, I will go find street parking. Then I am informed it is only twin beds. I didn't request this nor have I been anywhere that even used twins instead of full size in years. Fine. I said, well I don't know if I want to sleep in a twin bed, I might make other accommodations. That's when they really pissed me off.

If my flight is canceled due to weather and you refuse to release my FRESH reservation, they still refund me.I decide to check out the room. The sad part is, the room and amenities are really nice.

I said I called the front building location and pressed one for reservations. I am then told that is not the right desk. None of my interaction would I remotely describe as hospitable. I am here on work not vacation. I don't care about Waikiki I am here all the time. I care about being away from home, paying a $150 a night to be made to feel like it is entrapment.

The staff at the hotel was very nice and helpful. We were warmly welcomed when we arrived. The hotel has complimentary shuttle service to Ala Moana shopping center, you get beach towels from the hotel and they provide complimentary movie rentals. On the roof of the hotel is a swimming pool with chairs for sun bathing. The pool area was clean and nice, note that there is no staff or lifeguards at the pool area.

We were on the 22nd floor (apartment style hotel) in a one double bedroom apartment, very comfortable with a balcony access from the bedroom as well as the lounge. The view was spectacular looking at Waikiki beach with the waves rolling in, and the surfers waiting to catch the waves. The overall view from the balcony was just great.The staff were very friendly and the service was excellent. The Aqua Pacific Monarch had a daily free shuttle service operating every half hour or so to take you around the city, and drop you off wherever you wished, and picked you up from the drop off point back to the hotel. The apartment had a microwave, kettle, coffee making gadget, fridge, and cutlery with plates and saucers and the usual stuff that one would have at home. They did not stint on the coffee, sugar or crema.Yes, this is a hotel I would recommend to anyone.","Surfers Paradise, Australia","Errol M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Surfers Paradise, Australia</strong>",30,4.0

We really had to rely on reviews for our first visit to Hawaii. We selected this place because it had a kitchenette and we were glad we did. It was very convenient to have some place to have breakfast or an afternoon snack. We had seen some negative comments online about the noise but the Waikiki area of Honolulu is a busy and noisy city. We were on the 29th floor and if you have the large 10' patio doors open you are going to hear city noise. The place was clean. The cleaning staff made up the room every day and kept is well stocked with coffee and toiletries. The front desk staff was very helpful and courteous. The pool and hot tub on the roof was great but beware that any rooftop area is going to be windy on any day. If you choose to spend some time on the beach, don't forget to ask for the beach chairs. They loan them to you at no cost. On our last day we had to check out at noon but our flight didn't leave until 1030pm. We checked our luggage at the desk and went on a catamaran excursion. When we returned they gave us towels and access to the pool and the shower on the upper floors. It made for a great last day. We were warned in advance that there would be some renovations in the lobby area during our stay. We were not inconvenienced one bit. That should be done in early December. Oh, and most important, we found a great little Mexican restaurant just down the street that was great for happy hour.","London, Canada","Richard G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, Canada</strong>",3,5.0

It was on the 6th floor and overlooked the car park and had a small long balcony that you would never go on..

We did cook in a couple of nights, if you want to shop we recommend going to the Food Pantry which is about 10 minutes walk which a proper supermarket with fresh fruits, meat and fish or ABC store 2 min away but a lot less choice and more expensive.The sheets were supposed to be replaced every three days I don't think this was the case but it was not an issue and I am sure if we'd ask they would have done it.Towels can be replaced everyday if required.Overall the place looked a little dated but it was all very clean.We also use the pool and the hot tub on the roof which was very enjoyable, the pool is rather small so can quickly get over crowded. The hot tub had a timer on the side of the building (you had to know it was there as not obvious) and was very hot and powerful bubbles, very relaxing. You will also get great 360 views of the surrounding from the roof top.We also used the free shuttle to Ala Moana a couple of times, ideal to go shopping or connect with local buses for a trip around the island.I would definitely recommend this hotel as it is literally 5 min from the beach and it is all you can expect and more.","Yeovil, United Kingdom","Karine L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yeovil, United Kingdom</strong>",26,4.0

Overall, I would say I was pleased with what we found. There is a mini fridge, kitchenette and dining table in our room. The location is perfect. There is a well known local restaurant where you can get your sushi balls in the morning, a shuttle that takes you to the shopping center, and it was very close to Waikiki beach. We also did the Polynesian Cultural Center, and the shuttle to pickup for that excursion is also just a block down the road. The staff was great and attentive. There are some things that are the norm for hotels in that area which turn me off. All the hotels around there charge an amenity fee on top of the base rate. I think fees like that are questionable as there are things like the PS3 in all the rooms that go completely unused. They have a free DVD rental box, but who rents DVDs on vacation? I wouldn't recommend renting a car for this hotel as it's close enough to things you won't need it, and parking is sparse and expensive.

The many positive reviews I read prior to booking did it justice. Ideal location moments from the beach, fabulous views from the Ocean View Room on the 31st floor for a reasonable price. Every single staff member we encountered on our 9 night stay was super friendly and helpful. Although the hotel is looking perhaps a little tired, I felt for its 3 star rating, it was fabulous. If you want new, perfect and modern, then go elsewhere (and pay much more) I loved that it has an older, 70s authentic vibe in reception. Our 1 bedroom ocean view was completely perfect for the 4 of us. Kids on the pull-out couch, us in the surprisingly comfortable bed. I have a very expensive mattress at home which we have only had since October and we slept better at the Aqua Pacific. The room was clean and the daily servicing was more than I expected. Two minor things, when I booked I specifically requested twin beds in the bedroom as part of the booking process through hotels.com. Under additionals I asked for a high-floor room. We got the high floor room which I was very grateful for as it does get very loud on the streets below, especially when the garbage truck comes every single morning at 5am! However the room had a queen bed in it. When I called I was told it was not a guarantee and they had no twin rooms available. While I understand requests cannot be guaranteed (something it said in the part where I asked for the high-floor room) I thought when making the actual booking and given the option of being able to choose queen or 2 twins, this would be a definite. Maybe that's just a hotels.com thing. In the end it didn't matter. Our air conditioning wouldn't turn off one evening so I called and was told he would be 10mins. One hour later, I was still sitting on the bed waiting while my children slept in the lounge. We ended up pulling the plug out of the wall and restarting it in the morning which did the trick.

Very near the beach. The beach is crowded, but that’s Waikiki.2. Great ocean view from high floors. Not sure about lower floors.3. Convenient location to dining and shopping at all price levels.4. Extras ($15/day): Ice water dispenser in the lobby (refreshing!), DVD rentals, shuttle to Ala Moana, daily Honolulu Star newspaper, in-room coffee (blech), in-room safe, Wi-Fi, beach towels and chairs. Of these, we did not rent DVDs or use the shuttle or chairs. The beach towels were convenient. However, see cons #5 below5. Kitchenette (stove, micro, fridge, toaster, plates/utensils)6. Excellent housekeeping. Sign says they encourage re-using bathroom towels, and to place them on the floor if you want them replaced. We hung ours on the rack, but they replaced them daily anyway. Housekeeping staff was wonderfully courteous and efficient.7. Front desk staff was welcoming, courteous, and helpful.8. Good rates. ($135 to $190) but you get what you pay for. See below  And now for the cons:1. The Amazing Parking Lot Illusion. The connected parking lot structure is $25 per day. The front desk clerk actually advised us NOT to park in that lot. This is nearly verbatim what she said: “We don’t own the lot, and some of our guests have had their cars towed by the lot owners, even though they paid. It’s something about the parking pass not being displayed properly. You will have to go retrieve your car and pay the towing expenses.” I’m not making this up. The desk clerk recommended parking at the lot associated with Waikiki Banyan (201 Ohua Ave.) about 3 blocks away ($20 per day). So, it was always 3 blocks to our car (or from the car to the hotel). It wasn’t a long trek, and it was worth it not to worry about the car being towed. But what an unreasonable inconvenience.2. Impractical Air Conditioning (one-bedrooms only, not studio). Ours was a one-bedroom with a separate living area. The air conditioning was a small rectangular unit you would commonly buy at the hardware store and install through a window. It was mounted through the wall (not window) at floor level in the living area. It was noisy, but that would be expected. It cooled the room sufficiently. The problem is that there was no A/C unit in the bedroom, and the cooled air does not move from the living area to the bedroom. Result: hot bedroom. To cool the bedroom, we relied solely on the ceiling fan and sliding glass door to balcony. Had to sleep with the door open, and it was pretty noisy, even on the 31st floor.3. No Workable Rollaway Bed Option. They have rollaways and cribs. Our reservation stated that the cost for these was $25 per night, but on arrival the desk clerk insisted that it was $30 per night. It was a moot point, since there was no space for the rollaway. The bedroom had barely enough room to walk (just a few feet at sides and foot of bed), and the living area could not fit a rollaway unless the dining table and chairs were pushed into the corner of the room. But then there’d be no room to walk. Take careful a look at the pictures on the web site. That is literally all the floor space. 4. The Pool… Wait, Hot Tub… No, the Pool. The pool is on the roof. It’s tiny and shallow, which would be good for small children. But don’t try to swim in it. During our stay, the water was HOT. About 90 degrees. Solar power at work.5. The “Extras.” The $15 daily extras fee is mandatory. You must pay it. Well then put it in the room charge instead of trying to fake us out! Also, they list the in-room coffee, wi-fi, in-room safe as part of the extras. These should be included in the room charge. The DVDs and towels/chairs and newspaper I can understand. But the safe and the crummy coffee?  CONCLUSIONOn a budget, the Aqua Pacific Monarch is decent value. There are inconveniences, but not enough to ruin the trip. You come to Honolulu for the beaches and the island, not to spend a lot of time in the hotel. If traveling on a budget I might consider staying here again, but I will probably pay an extra $30 per night to stay someplace without the cons listed above.",San Jose Ca,"Matt Y</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose Ca</strong>",6,3.0

The rooms were spacious and we liked that there was a fridge, microwave, plates etc. which made it easy with our baby. As with any hotel, just a few cons. Non centralized AC (air would only be in living room, rest of the rooms had a fan but it did not keep us cool), furniture is a bit outdated and hardwood, with sharp edges (not baby friendly; our baby hit her head several times). Mattress was uneven, making it hard to sleep comfortably. Things to note: (1) Their parking garage is open to the public at $25/day. They make it a point to have your receipt visible on car dash, otherwise they will TOW YOUR CAR. Apparently happens quite frequently. (2) Complimentary shuttle runs from 6AM to 9PM that can take you all around town (3) You can rent movies (similar to Netflix) and playstation games (4) There is a fee if you do not return the beach towel cards.

It is what I would call mid range costing. The building itself presents well from the street, however the lobby area and rooms, while very clean are in need of an update. Having said that we would not hesitate to stay here again and we would happily recommend it. The rooms have kitchenettes complete with a full size, excellent fridge, dining table , sofa bed and a more than adequate living area. We were upgraded to an ocean view room and it had a separate bedroom and a large lanai complete with an outdoor table with a seating for four. The partial ocean view our friends had was one big room but similarly equipped. The staff are extremely friendly and nothing is a problem. You are greeted with a smile and Aloha everytime you see someone. There are three lifts that service all floors and they are fairly quick. You have an ABC store close by and the Food Pantry supermarket across the street and a block down. The walk to the beach is 2 mins straight down to the Dukes Statue on Waikiki Beach, perfect. Our room was mainly carpet but our friends were fully tiled, a much better idea and more serviceable. On the downside, the air conditioning units are extremely small and situated in the living room so is of little help during the night in the bedroom. The bedroom had a sliding door onto the lanai and a ceiling fan, the breeze was beautiful, the noise from the streets below horrendous . However after a couple of nights we were used to it and slept well. A couple of little things we noticed were the absence of coasters, as the furniture was all wood we went out and collected coasters to use in the room. Considering everything we would stay here again without a doubt, after all if you are looking for 5 star stay in one of the over priced beach front properties.

The Aqua is different in that the rooms are all individually owned private apartments but with the added advantage of being serviced just like any top class hotel. I'd read the reviews and decided to book. I arrived on April 4th warmly greeted as if I was an old friend and shown to the most marvelous studio apartment for my 3 week stay. The room was perfect for myself as a solo traveler with a huge bed, sitting area, kitchen facilities and bathroom. It looked spotlessly clean and I have to say that every day the wonderful house keeping staff kept it that way every day. Exceeding the Hilton's rooms I've stayed in previously was the full wall glass sliding doors that led the the balcony, which although narrow, not wide enough for a chair, it was more than adequate for me to watch the world go bye and see them surfing in the ocean just a block away. The facilities gave me far more options for dining and or drinking in my room than I'd had at the Hilton. It also has to be said that whenever I met a member of staff, be it in the elevator or just in the corridor etc, they always had a wonderful sincere smile and a few nice words.

( free )private Aqua Hotels shuttle to various places around town, just get on or off at the listed hotels. Great view from balcony, nice staff, lifts are reasonably quick (3 of them), plenty of car parking - never had to drive higher than say 3rd floor. Rental car places a 2 minute walk away. Swipe card security access after hours. Pool on roof 100% perfectly clean, with amazing views. Free Managers mini cocktails one night too. All in all a great place to base yourself if a) you dont want to spent $500 a night for beachfront or b) you dont want to stay way back near the canal, or in some 2 star place.Negs. - not too many, sure its a little 80s ish, but thats normal here.The time of year we visited, the weather was supberb, hot and yet not sticky . We never ran the A/C once....but it was a wall rattler mounted at floor height next to the bed. No issue for us..just saying.The only other thing was the noise. This has nothing to do with the Monarch... it is just a Waikiki thing. It is a very noisey place. With the balcony windows closed its ok...but this town must be where they test police sirens and noisey construction equiptment!There seems to be a never ending procession of Ambulances etc just driving around at about 50km/h with the worlds loudest sirens blaring?From the inside of the hotel the Monarch has done VERY well with regard to noise.We were next to the lift wells...and never heard a single thing.

Check in/out was quick and easy with friendly staff. Although we arrived well before check in time our room was ready for us. The location is fantastic, only about a 3 minute walk from the beach, and everything you need (groceries, bus stop, restaurants, shops etc) is within walking distance. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the shower was fantastic with great water pressure (sometimes hard to find in a hotel!) and was great value with a small kitchenette if you want to save some $$ by eating in (especially handy for breakfast). There was no real view from our room but it was very quiet, even on Halloween night. There is an Aqua shuttle that is included in the ‘resort fee’ that runs between various Aqua properties and the Ala Moana shopping centre, however it is often full (only seats about 12 people) and doesn’t appear to run to a set timetable so it's hard to tell if you’ve just missed one or how long you’ll have to wait until the next one comes along. However, I believe you can track its location with a web link, so this would not be an issue for those travelling with ready access to the internet. Compared to other properties in the area the resort fee is ok, $15 per day, but we certainly didn’t get any real use out of most of the ‘benefits’ that are included in the fee (such as dvd rentals and gaming units) but probably would be handy for those with children. The one big downside to our stay was the EXTREMELY loud air-conditioning unit. Ours was located at floor level and I noticed in some of the rooms they are right near the side of the bed.

This hotel is mature and obviously undergone a relatively recent reno. The room was outstanding in terms of cleanliness – the kitchenette, fridge and associated area were immaculate (plenty of cutlery and etc. too). The lobby is small, and a snack bar is adjacent which was popular with guests and workers in the area (also a Korean BBQ joint is across the street and Japanese restaurant next door. Security was better than in some of the more “fancy” hotels, where by accident I ended up on residential floors – this hotel requires a key card to access both the lobby washrooms, the elevator lobby, and the rooftop pool. Even my luggage was well looked after even though I had an 8 hour wait before I left for the airport (not just dumped in an open area of the lobby) – early arriving guests had their cases equally well looked after. Too, even after you have booked out staff will provide you with key card for access to washrooms, showers, the sauna and Hospitality Suite.My room, 2905, gave me a pretty view of the ocean and sunsets, and on Friday nights I had a ringside seat to the Hilton Hawaii Village firework display. The room was a lot quieter than many in large hotels, fewer slamming doors and drawer banging at weird hours – My only complaints were parties on 2 Saturdays on the 30th floor. Shouting, scraping chairs and noises that sounded as if someone was about to crash through the ceiling went on until the wee hours. The rest of the time it was quiet. Guests included extended families, honeymooners, retired persons, and young families. There were teens with their parents, but on the whole they were quiet and pleasant, as were the young families with toddlers (many were Japanese).Staff were wonderful, from the front desk to the cleaning and maintenance crews. They speak numerous languages, which considering many of the guests are Japanese and Philippino was obviously appreciated. Staying at the hotel felt more like a visit to a family owned establishment, than one of a chain. Additionally, you get to meet fellow guests and the staff in a charming manager’s social event on Wednesdays (nice munchies and drinks).There are free daily newspapers in the lobby (useful to find out about local events – many free), and a shuttle to the Ala Moana shopping mall. Unfortunately, while I was there, there were 5 days of almost continuous rain and everyone seemed to decide to go shopping – as the Pacific Monarch is almost the last stop on the free shuttle route it was very often full by the time it arrived! However, across the street from the hotel is a bus stop where the No. 8 stops, which goes directly to the mall. If it is wet, the hotel supplies a limited number of umbrellas to guests.Overall the hotel is superb and great value in an expensive resort (there are cheap supermarkets in the vicinity but skip the ubiquitous pricey corner ABC stores). It is barely a 5 minute walk from Waikiki beach. Only downside was some nauseatingly badly behaved tween kids from “down under”. Despite their mother’s efforts they screamed, fought, dove (in a pool varying from 3’ to 5’ deep and prohibiting diving) and did cannon balls that soaked guests sunbathing in the small pool area. A number of guests, despite signs to contrary, took glasses plus bottles of wine and beer, into the pool and hot tub. Some parents also seemed to prefer sleeping than watching their kids, little more than toddlers, in the pool and tub areas – a liability to both the hotel and their careless parents, not to mention worrying more caring guests.As someone with limited mobility, I should mention that the elevator stops one staircase short of the pool deck. There are around a dozen steps from the last elevator stop to the pool deck. It is not wheelchair accessible.",Toronto,"orped</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto</strong>",66,5.0

The only compensation she was offering was to remove the cleaning fee and of course not charge us for the days we weren't going to be staying. This completely annoyed me, and I refuse to give her our business any longer and asked for a refund of what we had paid to date. So that left us scrambling for a place to stay that could accommodate our large party. We eventually decided on Aqua Pacific Monarch based on hotel's location, consistent positive reviews and was within everyone's budget. Positives:- Rooms had a kitchenette which comprised of a electric stove, microwave, fridge and basic utensils for when you can make your own meals. - Fairly spacious room for my two young boys to move and play around in, and plenty of storage space for all our luggages. - The hotel is two short blocks away from the beach. The hotel is close to the nicer side of Waikiki beach where there's more sand real estate, and there was barricades to filter waves, so it was a very child friendly spot to swim. - Some great food joints within hotel's door step, (I strongly recommend that Korean BBQ place across the road) as well as various convenient stores for essentials. Staff were always friendly.- Guest collect beach towels and beach chairs for free from the front desk. We all stayed in studio style room apartment where there was a kitchenette and living room space.Negatives:- Although you can tell the room has elements of modern fixtures it's still quite outdated. The hotel is probably really old so it could do with a complete renovation - but that's just my opinion.- Weak air conditioning. None of the rooms have ducted or built in air conditioners, so there was a unit in one corner of the room that supplied all the cool air. If you're not in the room during the day it's fine, but we kept our thick curtains closed at all times to keep the heat out and cool air in. - Small bathroom with poor ventilation so would steam up quickly when taking hot showers.- Poor lighting in the room.- In our room house keeping was terrible. They would either not come so we'd have to call them to come in and do it, or arrive at 9am when we're still in the room. This happened everyday during our stay. - Although the hotel was close to the beach it was a little bit of a hike to the retailers and popular food joints. I don't mind walking however with young children four blocks to get anywhere can be challenging if a child is not in the mood for walking. - There was a free shuttle bus that would take guests to Ala Moana Mall but it was always full from collecting other guests from other hotels. Plus it only came around every 30 minutes. It was easier and quicker to catch a bus from across the road, buses that included Ala Moana Mall in it's route came every 5 minutes. It was under $3US a ticket from memory.Would I stay at Aqua Pacific Monarch again? No. There's are so many more other accommodation options available in Hawaii. Given we were forced to find an alternative so soon to our departure date, this was what we could find that met everyone's requirements.",Sydney,"cestella</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",96,3.0

There are plenty of bath and beach towels. While the small kitchen doesn't have a range, there is a serviceable hot plate that was good enough to make eggs and the fridge is plenty large enough for anything you may need to keep cold. My only real complaint is that the small AC unit is dated and doesn't work very well. On hot nights, it can get a bit sweltering. I'd normally sleep with the sliding doors open to let in the cool air, but sometimes the street noise can get loud. Also, the stand-mounted fan had a broken switch and I had to jerry-rig it to keep it on.There's a 4 floor public garage in the building. While not cheap at $25 per day, the self-service parking ticket machine is easy to use and now has multi-day options, so you don't have to keep buying new tickets every day.

I don't need a resort experience traveling to Hawaii. This is a basic condo-style property in the middle of Waikiki, two blocks from the beach and 3-4 from the Ala Wai canal. Everything you could want or need is within walking distance, or with a $2.50 ride on the city bus, aptly called ""The Bus"".I have no real complaints. My unit was very clean, some aged furniture but no big deal. The bathroom and kitchen fixtures/appliances appeared to be new (if not, very well maintained). A major plus is the fact that Iyasume Musubi, a Japanese cafe with delicious, cheap eats, is located on the ground floor of the hotel.A negative in my opinion is the fact that the property charges a taxable $15/day "" resort fee"" for some very basic amenities (shuttle bus, DVD rental, local newspaper, ""water in the lobby""(?)). This is the case across the Aqua brand and I can't see why they can't simply raise rates a bit to offset the cost of these amenities, which surely do not add up to $15+tax/day/person. The result of them not doing this is them being able to advertise unrealistically low rates ($139/night I think for my stay), when the actual cost is higher.

The room was smaller than we thought (by looking at photos) yet clean and very functional. Balcony is quite roomy however there isn't a light, we solved that by moving the lamp close to the door and leaving the curtains open (easy fix). The $15 a night hospitality fee (compulsory) was a bit annoying but apparently is everywhere in america. They give you free movie and playstation rentals, beach towels, beach seats, umbrellas and have a rooftop pool and spa. They also have a courtesy bus going to and from the ala mona shopping centre every 30minutes. Only 2 small blocks away from the beach. Food pantry (one of few grocery stores on the island) was just around the corner, as well as multiple foods places and abc stores. There is a tour shop around the corner (next to bottle shop) and the lady in there is very helpful. Perfect location. Free wifi was easy to access and use not slow at all.Danny and Johnny are loverly and will do anything to make your stay here the best. We had issues with our safe but a simple phone call to reception and they fixed it straight away. Johnny also use to be a concierge so he is full of very useful information! Only downer to the hotel was the sofa bed. you could feel the springs through the mattress, but we just asked for some extra blankets folded them us and put them between the bed and the mattress.

This is a functional apartment hotel (serviced apartments), not a luxurious five-star hotel. I had a one-bedroom apartment with ocean view on the 23rd floor, which was quite spacious with a full kitchen, dining area, and balcony. The bedroom was small but sufficient and the bathroom was just fine but nothing special or memorable, more like what you might have at home. The view was great, framed by the two towers of the Hyatt but you do get to see a lot of the ocean, and on the balcony, the view of the mountains is very nice too. The apartment was in pretty good shape, especially the kitchen was very clean, though otherwise housekeeping could have been more thorough: there were crumbs on the floor that didn’t get cleaned during my entire stay. As other reviewers have noted, the a/c is very noisy and there’s no a/c in the bedroom, only a fan. That was enough for me even during an unseasonably hot November but if you like to live in fridge, it might not be cool enough. Wifi was very strong and reliable as was water pressure (which can be a concern on a high floor). Front desk staff were friendly and helpful, and while I found the $15 “hospitality fee” annoying, it’s common in Waikiki. The location is very good, two blocks away from the Food Pantry, which is the only real supermarket in Waikiki, and also just two blocks from the beach. I thought Pacific Monarch was a good choice for a self-catered stay in Waikiki, and I’ll probably go again.","Melbourne, Australia","melbguy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",163,4.0

We stayed for 6 nights here, and it turned our Hawaii vacation into a total nightmare!! 1. During our 7-day stay, water never stopped dropping from somewhere high above the hotel building just in front of the hotel entrance. There is even puddles right there!! Moreover, there is construction going on around the hotel. Instead of soothing sounds of waves, noise of construction will be your company. Of course, nothing about puddles nor noise were informed in advanced.2. During our 7-day stay, none of the hotel staff is smiling. Maybe it is because we are not English native speaker, the staff were always frowning when they found out they could not understand us whenever we tried to ask for help. What is more surprising is that even the Japanese staff was not smiling. We felt totally unwelcome despite we paid quite a sum to this hotel.3. We traveled with our 1.5-year-old son, and I believe the hotel was also aware of it before our arrival. Nonetheless, the hotel offered us a room with twin beds put in the middle of the room. In order to prevent our son from falling down from the bed, we moved the heavy beds against the wall. When we came back the next evening, something magic happened! The heavy beds were moved back to the original location!! The next morning, we wrote a note to tell the housekeeper that we have a 1.5-year-old son, and the reason why we need the bed against the wall. However, the beds were put back again to the original location when we came back later that evening. However, the note was put on the dresser so it is certain that the note must be written. I called the reception to negotiate this problem. The nigh-duty staff just kept saying “ The housekeeper is not in the hotel anymore, call again tomorrow morning.” “I could not promise anything but tell your situation to our boss.” The next morning, I wrote a note again, but this time with tips. In God we trust, the beds were finally not moved back again later that evening. 4. The room facilities are in such a poor condition that we kept asking ourselves if we had been in a developing country? The air conditioner is as loud as airplane engines. We could not fell asleep at all if the air conditioner had not been turned off. Moreover, even if we tried to adjust the temperature and the fan speed, they never changed!! What better is that the wind is coming right to the position where the pillows were!! How comfortable it was!! 5. From the very first day, the water was leaking from the pipe under the sink. After the hotel tried to fix it, the water was leaking both from the tap and the pipe under the sink. How marvelous it was! 　After a new tap was changed for us, the bathtub stopper was broken!! Not to mention the quality of the shampoo and shower gel were so bad that our son felt itchy after using them.Everyday we were worried about anything would be broken again during our stay. How lucky we were. 6. The hygiene is also bad! Dried blood stains were found on the mattress!! I cannot believe it was the hygiene standard of a hotel at Waikiki beach, Honolulu. Our stay at Aqua Pacific Monarch was a total catastrophe. We will never ever stay at this hotel again.","Tokyo, Japan","tokyoyoyoyo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",8,1.0

The view was amazing and the beach to the left of the hotel was great for the kids to swim with some protection from the surf.

With that being said, if we plan to splurge on a family vacation for the four of us, you can believe that we will thoroughly research for THE best accommodations for our budget. Here is our breakdown of the AQUA PACIFIC MONARCH HOTEL:Location: Being centrally located in Waikiki, we never needed to take the bus, it was a short walk to everything we wanted to see or do in the area. Literally, within minute(s) from the hotel, you can walk to many souvenir shops and high-end stores, countless eateries, a grocery store, ATM machines and car rental counters.Highlight: You will be just 2 short blocks (3 minute walk) from Kuhio & Waikiki Beaches.Hotel: We're not ones to care much about the outer appearance of a hotel, we care more about the inside. You are not going to find a landscaped waterfall or dolphins swimming in a lagoon, at the AQUA PACIFIC MONARCH HOTEL you will find nothing fancy, just a clean and well kept building with 2 restaurants on one side and the hotel's public parking entrance on the other.Highlight: Both restaurants within the hotel are very good and very affordable.Room: We can only speak for our room, we did not get a chance to peer in any other rooms. We were fortunate to get an upper floor corner room with a bedroom and we had both an ocean view and a city view and it was well worth the paying the extra for it. The rooms were large and the furnishings were clean and adequate. The full sized refrigerator came in handy when storing a case of water and our leftovers.Highlight: The lanai (outdoor balcony) was large and had a round dining table and chairs, perfect for eating our meals and enjoying the million dollar views of the ocean and Waikiki's skyline. More time was spent in the lanai than inside the actual room!Hotel Amenities: Beach towels-we took full advantage and grabbed the towels every day when heading out to the beach. Daily newspaper-grab them early. Pool/Jacuzzi-can get crowded at times but sun deck is huge enough to accommodate everybody. DVD/PlayStation Game kiosk-we did not use...watch a movie in the room or go explore paradise? The choice was easy! The AQUA shuttle to and from Ala Moana Mall-used only once. A lot of times it fills up and you have to wait for the next shuttle (30+ minutes) and it stops at each AQUA hotel for pick-up/drop off. Highlight: If you have a lower room where the views are okay, go to the roof where the pool is located. The views are spectacular!Cons: Of course not every hotel is perfect. The good news is that the AQUA PACIFIC MONARCH HOTEL did not have very many. A/C Units-For such large rooms, there is one small unit in the main living area not in the bedroom. We could leave in the morning and return at night with the unit on at full blast and we come back to a room that was meagerly cool and warm bedroom at best. There was an overhead fan in the bedroom that circulated the warm air around.Mirror-The females in our group found this hard to adjust to. We can't speak for other rooms, but there was no full length mirror to use.Sofa bed-As an adult, I wouldn't want to sleep on it for more than a night, you feel the metal support bars really fast. For my kids, they had no complaints sleeping on it for 9 nights.Laundry Area-For a large hotel that is family friendly, there were just three operational washers (top load) and 6 or 8 dryers. Maybe it was bad timing but all were in use whenever we attempted to use.Garage-$25/night to park your car..ouch! It's a public garage with no discounts to guests.Elevators-with three elevators servicing 30 floors, there could be a wait for a crowded elevator. From the lobby, you can see maybe 2 of the three elevators moving at best.BOTTOM LINE: Would we stay here again? We're already planning our return! The AQUA PACIFIC MONARCH HOTEL was THE best hotel for our family. The most important thing was that everyone, including my children loved this hotel and the conveniences that came with it.Highlight: The staff. Professional, courteous and eager to please. From the lobby staff, the maids on the floors, the guy cleaning the garage areas to the manager herself, everyone was genuinely nice and made you feel that your questions and concerns were their top priority.

Three years later, same room but the fold out lounge was a little lumper for them and not as comfortable. The location is fantastic for families as Kuhio Beach Park is a two minute walk. The Food Pantry is a 10min walk for breaky and dinner supplies and plenty of other cafés and restaurant options in walking distance. The air conditioner was in the lounge room so it got very hot in the main bedroom but was too noisy at night to open the balcony door. Stay 14 nights and the room price drops.

One block up and there is food pantry which was a great supermarket for our apartment. We absolutely loved our apartment. The balcony this high up had amazing views and the kitchen and lounge were perfect for our holiday. We spent many afternoons chilling watching the surfers and people go about their holiday. We didnt use the air con but left our doors open to get the nice breeze. Full sized fridge oven were also handy. The wifi in this room was perfect, full signal and quick speeds. We got the paper downstairs for the nightly tv guide and if you get sundays paper it has the full week. We also took up the dvd rentals that were available which were great to have. The rooms were cleaned well every day. We did find that reception staff were not as ""Happy"" and we often had to say good morning first or didnt even get eye contact (not like bali or thailand happy if you know what i mean) they were not rude but we did notice the difference. Check in was a bit hectic with the lady not speaking strong english and trying to explain the security holding fee ($50) then resort fee of ($16 with tax) per day and when they would be charged. The free shuttle bus is handy but the bus if usually full and the driver frustrated with having to tell people no. There is a bus stop on the other side near food pantry $2.50 and it will get u to the shopping centre so dont be afraid to use it. There are also trolly bus's that u can get that go up that way as well. There is a rubbish shoot in the hallway if your bins get full too. Me bbq across the road is fantastic so check out my review on that. Abc store one stop up is also very handy with well priced wine beer and other essentials. The hyatt hotel is infront and normally the pick up stop for a lot of tours. We loved our stay in this one bedroom apartment. It was perfect for the resting part without feeling like you are missing out on the beach or hiding in your room. Pull the blinds, open the windows and doors and soak up waikiki! While not being cheap its the best deal for what you get in waikiki with the balcony or the mid price range. 9 nights was about 2500 Aud after tax and conversion.

We are a family of 4, with two daughters aged 6 and 9.We chose to stay here based on the strength of the TA reviews and the price. We are delighted with our choice and we will stay here again without hesitation.It is not a 5 star hotel. Nor is it beach front. . In saying that it is not beach front, we had partial ocean views and the beach is only a short walk (2 small blocks).We stayed in a one bedroom apartment. We had the comfortable queensize bed (I think it was this size anyway) and the kids stayed in the comfortable sofa bed. The sofa bed arrangement might not suit everyone, but it was fine for us. I am not sure if it would work with older kids? I did see staff with a rollaway bed one day.Maybe this is an option.The Aqua Pacific Monarch suited us as we wanted reasonably priced accommodation for our family, and we also wanted a kitchen where we could prepare meals. We enjoyed having breakfast on our balcony, especially those few mornings where we had a little sleep in. We did not actually cook dinner in our room, but we could have if we wanted to. We often bought lunch at the ABC stores and came home to eat it on the kitchen table.We found that we did not need to use the air conditioner. We actually slept with the doors open, as surprisingly , there were no bugs/mosquitoes flying in the room at night (Most Aussies will know what I am talking about)!We used the free shuttle to Ala Moana. This was handy!We loved the beach towel service.The staff without exception were polite and helpful. We felt welcome and we felt part of the hotel community. Several guests that I spoke to , were loving their visit at the hotel, with one Aussie saying he would not stay anywhere else and he has been coming to Hawaii for years.Housekeeping provided an excellent daily service, thank you. It was good also to be able to use the wash and dryer laundry facilities at a reasonable cost (From memory $1:75 each)My kids enjoyed the pool on the roof top (Amazing views).The spa looked inviting but we did not use it.We did not use the Playstation or the complimentary DVD's either ,but might on the next occasion.The hotel staff were helpful with directions and recommendations. There was a weekly sign in the reception showing various things that were happening in the Waikiki area.I enquired about beach chairs and beach umbrellas on the last day. Apparently there are chairs available but no umbrellas. Complimentary umbrellas would be my only suggestion for improvement (I might have to bring my own umbrella next time as the daily rental is worth more than the cost of a brolly in Australia).We are already planning our next trip to Hawaii, and hope to stay here again. It was perfect for us, and I miss it already.Me and my husband had a very comfortable bed, queensize from memory. Our girls slept on a sofa bed in the lounge room.

My kids of course are picky and didn't want to take in the local flavor so Mcdonalds, Sudway, Burger King right around the corner. You can walk out the door and there is a Korean BBQ place that's good plus a real healthy cafe next door.Downside : The balcony is about 2 feet wide. Your are really only able to just stand out there. No chair or table space. Was still nice though.

They have a free shuttle, that takes you to the Ala Moana and back daily, which was great. We walked there a few times, but it is great when you have been shopping and dont want to carry all your bags. :) The shuttle drivers were lovely, and very helpful. We stayed in a studio room on the 28th floor. It was a bit small for 4 people, but I am not complaining. It accommodated our needs. If we wanted more space, we could have booked a bigger room. It was good to have a kitchen, and gave us the option to cook our own food. We had a kettle, microwave, stove, fridge, coffee machine, utensils, sink, plates etc. The hotel is about 1 minute walk to the beach front, and about 30 seconds to the nearest ABC store. The staff were professional, friendly and very helpful.The rooftop pool was awesome. Always clean. The spa was also great too. I have read a few reviews from people complaining about the noise. I did not find this a problem at all. Sure, you hear a few screams from people on a Friday and Saturday night, but I think you would hear that at any hotel.All in all. I will surely be staying at the Pacific Monarch when I next come to Waikiki.","Cairns, Australia","Georgia S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cairns, Australia</strong>",34,5.0

The hotel is close (5 min walk) to retail shops which are located on the main road (Kalakaua Ave). There are ABC shops everywhere and they can provide you with basic amenities and groceries ie drinks, bread etc. There is a big SafeWays grocery store located about 20min walk away but found it expensive. The free wifi in your hotel room and hotel foyer is great. We had a studio apartment ocean view for 3 adults and it was great. Had a kitchenette, balcony, everything you need. Great ocean views from the apartment and also from the balcony which had a table and chairs. The hotel provides a free shuttle service which is fast and convenient. It runs along the major road, from Diamond Head right to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre. Staff were friendly and helpful. Hotel is also located near public transport bus stops, so you can get around Honolulu to the tourist spots in-expensively this way ie Pearl Harbour, Diamond Head (approx US$2.50 each way).

No major problems. Our room had one bedroom, one bath, kitchenette, sofa bed.Adequate parking ($25 per day), better than some of the cramped parking stalls in many Waikiki hotels. Parking is on the 2nd to 5th floors. We had no problems finding a spot (they do not guarantee a spot and the parking is public) during this time, Try the 4th and 5th floors as everyone seems to grab the first spots they see. I parked with the ramps behind me for ease of backing out. You need your room card to get back in from the parking stalls else you have to walk down to the front desk and to get to the elevators. Since Waikiki has many one way streets, get a GPS or familiarize yourself with the streets beforehand. Driving was not a major problem if you take it easy and pay attention.At the top, they have a swimming pool and hot tub with a great panoramic view of Waikiki and Honolulu. There is an enclosed lounge (sink and tables) with a great view. Daily housekeeping and daily Honolulu Star Advertiser newspaper in the lobby.We were on the 17th floor (1707). Room have a kItchen, refrigerator, stove, etc. Short walk along Kuhio Avenue to restaurants and shopping. Room doors had a 1 inch gap so you can hear floor traffic and conversations. You can stand on the ""balcony"" but there is no room for a table and chairs to seat outside and enjoy your breakfast unlike other hotels. No washer/dryer in the condo. There is a coin operated laundry in the parking facility (ask the front desk).Since you are in Waikiki, you can hear the police and fire sirens at night. The view was not that great but then again if you are staying 24/7 in a hotel room in Oahu then ""why are you actually here?"", you should be out at the crack of dawn and be staggering back in late at night being a tourist. About 2 and a half blocks to Kuhio Beach. Kuhio Beach is a safe beach with a sea wall providing a safe shallow swimming area for children, non swimmers. Get a face mask and snorkel and you can find Hawaiian reef fish along the sea wall. The hotel gives you a ""towel card"" that you trade in for a beach towel. (Make sure that you give back ALL your cards when you check out as there is a $30 charge for any missing beach towels).If you do not want to swim at Kuhio, walk about 3 more blocks towards Diamond Head (across from the Honolulu Zoo) to Queen's Beach for open ocean and a rockier bottom (with a lot more and larger reef fish, think ""free but smaller "" Hanauma Bay without the parking problems, drive and fees).If you have kids, there is a Makittii Buffet (2380 Kuhio Avenue) about a 3 minute walk away on Kuhio. Since you have a condo, the closest grocery is Food Pantry (2370 Kuhio Avenue) about a 2 minute walk, close to Makittii. If you have a rental car or want to use the Bus, try Don Quijote (801 Kaheka Street), a local complete grocery store about 1.8 miles away near Ala Moana Shopping Center with an outdoor food court and Asian deli indoors with tourist goodies, bakery, produce. (They have their own web site so you can check their ads, do a Google seach for ""Don Quijote Honolulu store"").Wal Mart is about 2 miles away (700 Keeaumoku Street) near Ala Moana. Costco is at 525 Alakawa Street about 5.5 miles away (hit them on the way in from the airport). There is a second Honolulu Costco at 333 Keahole Street abut 8.5 miles away, head toward Hanauma Bay out of Waikiki. I think that they started charging a $15 daily convenience fee (ask the hotel staff) which includes a shuttle to Ala Moana Shopping Center about 2 miles away. Since we made our reservations out in April 2014, there was no resort or extra fees at that time. If you are shipping goodies back and want to make sure that your boxes or luggage is 50 lbs or less, ask the front desk to use their ""hand scale"" to weigh your stuff.","Hayward, California","darthdes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hayward, California</strong>",81,4.0

The hotel is fairly close to the airport. Transportation: No need to take any airport shuttle to get to the hotel. The cost for a taxi from the airport to the hotel is around $50 - not including luggage. The SpeediShuttle costs $60 while being shared with other passengers. Although renting a car is always an option, I would strongly recommend against doing so - the daily parking is around $25, plus car rental tends to be rather high (unless you have some kind of corporate discount - in which case the rate goes down rather steeply and makes renting worth your while, even in Hawaii). Include costs of gas, additional parking whenever you go to some other place and soon you are looking are real money. Taxis are plentiful and tend to be available at all the touristy spots. Dining: There are plenty of dining areas and watering holes near the hotel. Take your pick from Italian, Mexican, and local fare. Shopping: Although we never went shopping, we were led to believe that there is plenty of shopping also nearby.Attractions: The three attractions we visited were Pearl Harbor (separate review), Waikiki beach (beautiful beyond words to those who don't have beaches in their backyard - coming from New Jersey, the beach was ... meh ... compared to Miami and Myrtle beach and Cape May) and Diamond Head (separate review).Accommodations: Although the pictures accompanying this review are dark, rest assured that their so-called studio is actually a one-bedroom hotel. Coming from NJ, my definition of a studio is much more restrictive - a single room. Our unit had a sitting room with a queen-sized sofa-bed, a small glass top dining table with two chairs and another table with a couple of chairs. The balcony (or Lanai as Hawaiians tend to refer to them) was spacious with two chairs and a table and was accessible from the bedroom as well as the sitting room. The space on the balcony in front of the bedroom was very limited. Service: We had booked this from a service called booking dot com and we were told as we were checking in that we only had a city view unit. Which is factually correct. But if you stepped out to the balcony, you could clearly see the ocean - albeit just slices of it between a couple of buildings - in front of Waikiki beach. The cleaning service did a decent job. But they do NOT clean the utensils left over in the sink. Amenities: There is a full kitchen, including a full size fridge and a sink with hand dishwashing fluid and a scrubber available. There were bowls, plates, spoons, serving spoons, 3-4 heating utensils - and an electric stove with 4 burners. The exhaust vents into the room itself, so be careful with heating flavourful dishes - you have to live with the odours for the remaining time. The bathroom is good, the water pressure was good. Everything was working fine. The air conditioning is next to the dining area, close to the balcony and is only able to cool a few square feet around that area. The bedroom and the sitting room do NOT get cooled by the (rather loud) air conditioner. We were fortunate we visited at a time when there was no need for the AC. The queen size sofa-bed is truly enough for two normal sized adults. We asked for additional pillows and sheets and got many - as many as we wanted. Overall: We were very happy, with four of us - myself, my wife and two teenage children - with the place.","Monmouth Junction, New Jersey","indianrediff</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Monmouth Junction, New Jersey</strong>",21,5.0

I will try and summarize the pros and cons in order to keep this review short:Pros: (i) excellent location - it is a short walk to Waikiki bay, super close to some great restaurants and shopping centers; also very close to Diamond Head.(ii) friendly staff;(iii) great views from the hotel.Cons:(i) parking- the parking area in the hotel building do not belong to the hotel and are run by another company. The towing policy is brutal.. although we prepaid our parking our rental car was still towed after we left the car unattended for approx 30-40 mins taking our beach gear, towels etc back to the hotel room (our fault - we were on vacation mode). Because we did not rent a car on our first day, the hotel check-in did not place emphasis on how brutal the towing is there. Be aware! Display your parking ticket for example upside down - your car will be towed. It took a $34 cab ride at night to a dodgy neighborhood and only $198 later to retrieve the car - do not expect any assistance from the hotel since they do not run the parking.","Hamilton, Bermuda","Hanrobb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamilton, Bermuda</strong>",8,3.0

Me and the girls I was staying with felt safe walking around at night as there are lots of other people around usually.Within 10 minutes walk of the hotel was everything that you need, from food options, shopping, most of the trolley/bus routes (including to Ala Moana and Waikele Premium Outlets), a lovely stretch of Waikiki beach, but less crowded than further north and many entertainment options.Check-in was smooth and quick, my friends showed up a couple days before I did and they had no issues, even though I was the one who booked the accommodation. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable.The room, we got a room on the 10th floor, room 1007 and it was a good quality 1 bedroom apartment, the furniture was of an acceptable quality, it wasn't ""high end"" but it was mid-range which is what we paid for and was comfortable so no complaints.We could see the ocean from our balcony, for being on a busy street corner and in Waikiki in general, we didn't notice much traffic noise except a couple times with all the windows and door open and then only during daytime, at night there was no issues for us with noise.What I really liked was that we got a full kitchen (one of the main reasons we chose this hotel) including a proper sized fridge, oven and appliances. This was good as it meant we could store food in the fridge/cupboards so we didn't have to eat out every meal, which brought the food costs down.Bathroom was good, everything worked and the shower pressure was better than I get at home.Air conditioning did a good job keeping the room at a decent temperature.Beds, the main room was taken by the girls and they said it was super comfy, I got the sofa bed, I found it comfortable.We didn't make use of the hotel pool/spa/common areas that were at the top of the hotel, but we did go up for a look and the views were spectacular (couple are included in photos). The definite highlight of our trip though was Mary-Ann on the tours desk, she was super helpful, helping us book rental cars, tours, luaus and just being a really nice person to sit down and chat to, even when she was struggling with allergies she was a pleasure and super cheerful.All in all, everything was great during my stay, I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere to stay that has a decent location, is comfortable and doesn't break the bank (as quite a few hotels in Waikiki can).If I come to Waikiki again I plan on staying here again.","Auckland, New Zealand","jeremy k</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",10,5.0

I'll start off with the positive... Customer service was great! Even coupons available upon checking in to restaurants and activities in the area. Our main concern was the black hair found on our ""fresh"" towels. And the blood droplets throughout the entire room (bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, and entry way). GROSS!! After calling down to speak to a manager, we finally had to go down to the lobby because it wasn't being taken care of. After explaining our situation to the manager and showing multiple pictures , he very quickly hushed us and assured us they were just food particles. (Pictures have been posted on here, definitely not just food!) He moved us up two floors with a half view of the ocean! No blood this time!! Thank God!! Didn't get the managers name but thanks for solving our problem after some stern complaints when nothing was getting done. Honestly unsure if I'd ever stay here again after the situation and being told it was food when clearly it was blood.. Great customer service though! But be warned...

Trying to save money, we opted at first for the most inexpensive room they had--on a lower floor, a studio with a small kitchenette, no view. The hotel offered us an upgrade for a reasonable cost and we moved up to a one-bedroom unit on the 27th floor, partial ocean view, lovely view of the local mountains, large balcony, and a much larger kitchen area. The separate bedroom and large living room--including an eating area--were really nice. We were there for 5 nights and the extra expense was worth it. The bathroom is small, but more than adequate. As other reviewers have noted, it is older and at times it shows. That said, the room was extremely comfortable, the staff very helpful, the location very convenient--the beach was only a 10 minute walk, if that!--and parking was reasonable for the area. There is traffic noise and there isn't any air conditioning in the bedroom. It would have been nice to have the promised wifi, but it wasn't working that week.

When we first arrived we got placed in a lower Cityview room when we paid for an Oceanview studio room but we told them it was a mistake and they immediately made things right and we got what we paid for and so much more. The view was amazing. We were very happy with everything from that point on. The mix up stemmed from the fact that they changed from Aston Pacific to Aqua. At least, that's the excuse they gave anyway. - The beds were very comfortable. There is a lot of street noise at night though.- Staff was great. Especially one of the ladies at the tour desk. Can't remember her name but she was very helpful. - Location is awesome. (a little ""shady"" at night though, but for the most part we felt pretty safe).- The pool area was alright, it was very windy, but the view is great. There is room for improvement though.- We found the air conditioning adequate. Excursion TIP: When you are waiting for the tour bus to pick you up stand on the corner of Kuhio and Uluniu Ave. We were told by the booking company to stand on Uluniu and wait for our tour bus but had to reschedule because the tour guide stopped on Kuhio and didn't look around the corner to see if there was anyone waiting and therefore left without us.I would stay at this hotel again.

I can tell you that the Monarch desk staff are kind and patient, the rooftop pool is a standard rectangle that is well maintained and the water is crystal clear, and the view of Honolulu from the rooftop pool is amazing.This IS a review of the Aloha Waikiki Condos (Aloha) at the Aqua Pacific Monarch hotel.When we checked in at the Monarch, we were told that we had no reservation. What we discovered was that we were booked into a private apartment (condo within the Monarch building) operated by Aloha. BE AWARE: We made our booking through Booking.com, thinking we were booking the hotel. There was no clarity that we were actually booking through a private entity.The hotel DOES NOT manage these condos, so it really isn't fair to expect support from the hotel staff. Even so, the hotel staff tracked down our keys, and we able to get in to the condo, without having to CALL Aloha (which is how you reach them).Our condo was on the 25th floor (2501), and has a good view of Waikiki beach. When we stepped in to the condo the sliding door was open, and the room was muggy. We closed the sliding door, and went in search of the thermostat so we could turn on the air conditioning (a/c). There was no thermostat, as the only a/c in the room is a floor level in wall a/c unit. We turned the a/c on, and quickly discovered that it cooked the bed nicely (since it is right next to the bed), but you leave the bed area you instantly feel the heat. Due to the heat the room is really not comfortable, due to the heat (and this is in October).The entire wall that overlooks the beach is a glass slider, with white curtains that are ineffective in blocking the lights of the city, making sleep difficult.The balcony is two feet wide (standing space only). You do have a good view from the dining table (in this standard issue rattan studio beach condo).We booked a kitchenette room that out to be a dual hotplate, microwave, toaster, and sink. The kitchen area is so small that the coffee maker and hot are on a roll cart. The kitchenette is at the farthest point from a/c, so cooking was a sauna experience. We were booked for three nights, but because of the issues in the condo we decided to leave a day early. We immediately contacted the condo folks (by phone), to let them know of our decision, and to ask them if they would refund the last day. They said ""no"", because we had already been there three days, even though factually we had only been there two days. ",,rocki166,40,3.0

The only negative about the rooms is that the very small air conditioner in each room is not adequate to cool the room. In one of our rooms the air conditioner was set in a mostly enclosed sitting area away from the bed and never cooled anything except the sitting area. Another room had the A/C right next to the bed which made it easier to sleep but the bathroom and sitting areas were extremely warm. Apart from the A/C issues we thought the hotel was fine.

We had a partial oceanview room (no separate bedroom because we had read that the air conditioning would not work well for this layout). The air conditioning wasn't as strong as I would have liked for the hotter May days in Hawaii but it worked well for certain portions of the room close to the air conditioning unit.

I read a lot of the reviews and I agree that the AC is not the greatest. I had a West facing room so I got the afternoon sun. I kept my curtains closed during the day and the AC on high in the afternoon, and low at night with the ceiling fan running constantly and the room was very tolerable. The room was very clean and did not have any strange smells. The kitchenette was great, complete with plates, silverware, pots & pans, coffee maker, corkscrew, etc. The fridge is small, but perfect for a short stay. There is a PS4 as well, I didn't use it, but I thought it was a great touch for those who have kids. The room was spacious with a couch on one end, a table with four chairs in the middle and two single beds on the opposite end. A desk and chair with swivel flatscreen TV. There is also a dresser for clothes. The people across the hall from me blasted their TV, but I was only able to hear it when I went onto the hall. With the AC running, I heard very little going on outside or around me and was able to sleep very well. The lanai is very narrow, but in the winter months it would be great to open the giant glass doors and just sit an enjoy the breeze. The pool is on the top floor and there is a spectacular view and breeze. There is also a nice room to relax just one floor below with a big screen TV, tables, and couches which also has a great breeze.The only negative is the AC is a floor level, not ceiling level so it is hard to get the cool air to circulate (and it blasted the bed closest to it) and I had a room with twin beds (although I used Hotwire and did not specifically request double/queen/kind).If you use a 3rd party (IE Hotwire, Expedia, etc) to book the room, pay close attention to your charges. The desk clerk wasn't aware that I had already paid at the time of booking and almost charged me again. No biggie, just something to know about.The location is amazing.

Sent our grandmother back for a few weeks' stay in August 2014. Upon arrival, she was severely disappointed in her room, which she equated to ""more Motel 6 standards than Pacific Monarch standards."" I contacted the reservations department who connected me to the hotel manager to whom I explained the issues. He (Randy) assured me that he'd see what could be done but because the weekend was completely sold out, it would be Monday at the earliest, and the issues were complicated by the need to have 2 side-by-side rooms as my grandfather travels with caregivers. Sunday morning, I got a call from my Grandmother that they'd found them new rooms and were moving them immediately. She is ecstatic with the new rooms. Thanks to Randy and his team going the extra mile to accommodate the needs of an 85 year old woman, I know my grandmother's last visit to Waikiki will probably be among her best ever.

One separate bedroom, with twin single beds and a fold out queen sized sofabed in the main room, both were clean and comfortable. We cooked most dinners there and had everything we needed to prepare and cook our meals including pots, pans, refrigerator and freezer, huge stove with 4 hotplates and oven, microwave, and coffee maker. Great location, a short walk (2 blocks) to main street of Waikiki.The noise level outside the hotel at night is about what we expected in the centre of a big city. Air conditioning noisy to us but the fans were quiet. Great location for us as we like to be out and active all day so don't have time to waste. The teenagers NEED their WIFI and that worked fine.

However, it did not cool the bedroom down during day time hours. At night, the temps drop so that it is comfortable again and the window could be opened, but the bedroom only had a ceiling fan. Bedrooms are sometimes needed during the course of the day.  - Yes, you are in paradise called Waikiki; but you will hear lots of street noise; sirens (police, fire, etc) in this concrete jungle even up on the 29th floor. Also, depending on the time of day, you will hear hula shows, drums, etc. The garbage trucks have beepers when they back up and these begin around 6:30am and last for a good 90 minutes several times a week.

The minute we walked into the studio, we saw the kitchenette, the decor and those patio doors, the kind that open up the whole room to the lanai/balcony. We stood there taking countless pictures of the mountains, the other hotels and the ocean / beach. She turned to me, smiled and gave me the biggest hug. We took pictures at sunrise and sunset. We loved every single minute of our stay. And even though we had to jam pack every event (from the Luau, shopping at Ala Moana Center, Circle Island to the Maita'i cruise) into those 5 days; we wished we could have spent just one day relaxing in our hotel room.

Lady at the your desk very good and can arrange anything for you.We hired a Hertz car through her: about $55 but if you booked the car online via Hertz, it was $85!!!!!!!!Location is great: two half blocks and you are at the Duke statue. Last time we stayed in Waikiki it was further away from the beach and very noisy: the Pacific Monarch was surprisingly quiet at night, and I guess if in a higher room, it would be even quieter.Overall, very satisfied.

There were three of us on the trip. A married couple and single man (all family). I think it was ideal for a couple or a family since privacy would be an issue otherwise.

Everything was as expected with some minor updates. It's important to point out that this property is not a resort, it's a condo building. So, as always, I'll rate this property based on the attributes it has set for itself. In other words, if you're looking for 5 star treatment you're not going to find it (nor should you expect it) in a 3 star condo. With the Pacific Monarch I believe you get what you pay for and then some.Location: A- No, it's not right on the beach but it's a short 2 block walk taking you to the best location on Waikiki/Kuhio beach. For the price you can't beat this location. To make my point you'll walk past the Hyatt where you'll pay twice the price for half the room.Lobby/Check In B- Great service, but lobby does need help. Still the staff are friendly, attentive and quick. One nice add (since Aqua took over management from Aston) is that they provide beach towels. Nice touch. We always bring our own but this really is a nice perk.Room C+ Funny thing, had they not renovated I'd had probably given this a B but I expected more after renovation. It was nice to see the newer furnishings (although was surprised how much use they've seen in such a short period) and nice newer flooring. That said, the paint was shoddy, the bathroom was pretty much untouched (needs new bathtub and fixtures), and the kitchen… what happened to the lighting? Was a bit disappointed. Still, for a couple hundred a night you get a 1 bedroom suite with a kitchen saving you tons of money eating out…and more space than the previously mentioned Hyatt.Technology D: Before the renovation you could ""wheel"" the TV into the bedroom, so if you wanted to watch a movie at night that was nice. The new flat screen is mounted to the wall so really only usable for the living room. Stations were limited. More frustrating was that the internet didn't work well. In fact, it wasn't usable.Gym: N/A Run on the beach or along the canal in the morning. Love it!Pool Deck: People rave about this but we never use it. Always at the beach.Overall Solid B: We'll be back when we visit Waikiki. While there are minor issues with the property, given price and location, it's difficult to beat it.

There's not enough clearance, but perhaps this could be corrected if the drawer was planed down a bit.All in all, a good place to stay!There's a pool and whirlpool on the roof, but we kept ourselves too busy to use them.","Des Moines, IA","Iowa_is_my_home</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Des Moines, IA</strong>",102,4.0

The following may help you, as, because it is a condo hotel, one is never sure of what is provided. Because airlines are all about luggage weight, why pack things if you don't have to?-pool towels are available at the front desk, so no need to bring your own.-all rooms have blow dryers-shampoo/conditioner/lotion/soap/bath gel are provided-paper towels, tea towel, basic cutlery, plates, rice cooker, cups, glasses are provided.-although they provided packets of ground coffee sealed in round coffee filter packs, it is not good coffee, and you get a few tiny packs of powdered whitener, a single pack of sugar etc that is inadequate, so, be prepared to get take out coffee, or buy grounds at numerous close stores. We use a paper towel as a coffee filter.-Bring you own salt and pepper or buy at the local grocery store.The Good-Charlie at the front desk checked us in and is very helpful. All others that we've encountered are nice as well.-Location.....3 ABC convenience stores within less than a 1 minute walk. Full sized grocery store called the Food Pantry is a 2 minute walk away. Front door to beach is a 1 minute walk. The views are spectacular as long as you are high up. We are on the 31st floor. Am not sure how high you have to be to get a good view. Pool is on 33rd floor. Great view.-Large lanai with table and 4 chairs-Excellent water pressure in shower and plenty of hot water-Good Housekeeping in suite, corridors and lobby.-Self serve laundry on 3rd floor in parking garage is handy. Quarters only. $2 wash and $2 dry.Could Be Improved-Generally, the room and furnishings are in good shape, but the bathroom tub/shower fixtures need replacing. They are old and shabby. The rubber baseboards in the bathroom are peeling away fron the base of the tub. Multiple layers of silicone etc, just doesn't give a feeling of cleanliness. Tub doesn't drain very well.- Roof top pool is small with not many lounge chairs. No atmosphere up there. Perhaps a bit of piped in music would help. We whisper to each other so others can't hear our conversations. Too quiet and dead feeling. Pool apron needs repainting. Lots of flaking paint.-Slow elevators-Poor lighting. Lamp shades are yellowed out. Dull lighting in kitchen area.On the whole, we are very pleased. Usually stay at the Sheraton Waikiki, but wanted the ability to have breakfast items etc. at hand, via fridge etc. Would not hesitate to stay here again. Just hope they invest some money on improving some of the older fixtures etc.","British Columbia, Canada","Kareyd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>British Columbia, Canada</strong>",26,4.0

We had a one bed condo with a city view on the 6th floor. It had two twin beds in the bedroom a small closet with a safe and a queen size bed in the living room & a sofa bed. It was listed as sleeping 5. It could sleep that many but where you would keep your luggage would be a problem. This worked well for the 4 of us. The twin beds will be short for a tall person. The bed in the living was situated in front of the air conditioning unit which blocked the rest of the room from getting any cool air. We immediately move the bed in front of the sliding glass door. This helped but it was still very warm in the bedroom. We kept the curtains closed to help keep it cooler. The curtains did not close tightly. I had brought clothes pin for hand washing laundry. They helped with keeping the early morning sun out. So it really did not matter what view we had because we kept the curtains closed. The lanai was pretty much useless as it was very small &narrow & the view was of the parking garage & the next hotel. We only use it to dry our beach shoes. The kitchen was equipped with a stove/oven, toaster, refrigerator, coffer maker, dishes/bowls, tea kettle, cup/glasses, pot & pans, silverware, dish soap, paper towels coffee, tea ,sweeter & creamer. We used a couple drawers in the kitchens to put clothes in. There is a laundry room on the 3ed floor $2 to wash $2 to dry. You could buy laundry detergent there we brought some tide pods with us.  They no longer charge the $15 a day amenity fee. The free wifi worked great. The bathroom has a shower tub combo. They provided bar soap, body wash shampoo & conditioner & fresh towels daily& mid week sheet change. The maid service was very good.The rooftop pool & hot tub had a beautiful panoramic view from the 32ed floor. We used it almost every day. On Friday night we went up and watch the fireworks. The location was very convenient to Waikiki Beach a 5 min walk about block & half. We rent 2 chairs & umbrella for $20 for 2hr or $50 for all day. Also one day we took an hr catamaran ride for $20 each. We got on near the beach 2 Duke’s.  Now don’t get me wrong this place is not perfect. The area off lobby near the elevator has a very bad smell as dose the stairway to the pool and the hall leading to our room smelled like garbage possibly due to the garbage shoot in the hall. But once you are in your room no odor could be detected. The couch was tired and definitely some new curtains or blinds would freshen up the condo. But we were there only a week we made the best of it.We felt safe & comfortable in our home away from home. We spent very little time in our condo with all there is to do and see. Not to mention the shopping! It was like New York City with palm trees lol. As for the shopping to name a few places the flea market @ the Aloha Stadium is a must on Wed, Sat or Sun. We took a shuttle for $5 each round trip and $1 to get in. We went there on our first full day and did not realize how good the prices really were. We had lunch from the shrimp truck & it was delicious one of many we ate from. There is a free shuttle to Hilo Hattie’s & it will take you to the Flea Market or the Ala Moana Shopping Center. Also there is a shrimp truck in the parking lot of Hilo Hattie’s. Until December, sadly there is the International Market Place. It is slated to be torn down to make way for a Saks Fifth Ave. @ the market there was some great place to grab lunch/dinner. Kings Village is not far from the hotel we notice it from the rooftop pool. One night they had a farmers market & live music. I found some nice souvenirs @ Ross. There is a post office @ the International Market & with a ships it fits box for $16.85 I shipped home my treasures. We contemplated renting a car and driving to the North Shore. Then we met a shuttle driver while we were @ the flea market & asked him about driving us around for the day. He quotes us $65 each & we felt this was good so we took him up on it. His name was Roz 1-808-699-7224. It was the best day. Roz took us all the way around Oahu. He knew exactly where to stop for the best views, interesting place to see & shop & a shrimp farm & restaurant for lunch called Romy’s. Most importantly he knew where the clean rest rooms were. We would have never found any of this on our own. Not to mention the stories alone the way. He picked us up @ 9a & dropped us off @ 6p @ any time we did not feel rushed. He was a very kind caring man he shared stories about his family & his life. We also use him to take us to the cruise port and to the airport. When we first arrive we used A8 and we had no complaints. All in all we enjoyed our stay @ the Aqua Pacific Monarch & if in the area would consider staying again. The location to the beach and the action are ideal & the staff where very helpful & friendly. During the week we attended the Germaine’s Luau it was a long ride in traffic on a bus. But Cousin Kenny helped pass the time joking around & getting people to interact with each other. The Luau will not start until all the buses get there. We must have been the last bus. As soon as we arrived after pictures we were lead to the picnic table about 3 row from the front and we where the first called up in line for the food. It was my first Luau the show was good the food not so much.  I will be glad to answer any questions.","Buffalo, New York","Shopping4fun</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Buffalo, New York</strong>",70,3.0

Need to work on their customer service. First issue minor - not overly friendly about rectifying their booking mistake - gave us a double (not ideal for adult brother & sister) when a twin room was clearly on our booking form. Their response was use the sofa bed, and were reluctant to move us to a twin room.The second issue was my mistake but I am really surprised that the hotel wasn't able to provide a good outcome. Just before checking out I'd put my wet bikini in a hotel towel to dry it off a bit, got side tracked packing & ended up leaving it behind. Contacted Hotel within 24 hours of checking out (as soon as I'd got back to NZ). Neither the hotel nor their laundry service located the bikini despite me telling them exactly where it had been left - seems strange to me a bikini wrapped up in a towel wasn't discovered by room service or laundry - where else could it get too?! Disappointed as I know of friends who've left cheap and easily replaceable umbrella's behind and a hotel has posted it to them!

The hotel is a 5 minute walk to Waikiki beach which was very convenient. There was ABC store on every corner if you needed to buy anything. If you want to buy liquor do it before 11pm!! One en night we were stuck driving around looking for a place to buy alcohol but they stop selling at 11pm everywhere. The rooftop pool was nice, such a great view. We went up there since the beach was too packed and it was nice to get some sun and be in the water.We rented a car since we went there for a wedding and needed to drive outside of waikiki area. I recommend if you are planning on staying in the waikiki area and only going out on tours you do not need to rent a car. We also needed to pay $20 a day for parking.We went to Hanauma bay for snorkelling which a must do! If you are driving I recommend going to Waimanalo beach. It is beautiful!!
