After I reached out explaining our situation, she contacted me and offered me either a gift certificate or a full refund for two prepaid room reservations.

I booked via BA executive club, and booked a penthouse suite, but the room that was reserved for us was a king room. There were no penthouse suites left, and the manager Maggie dealt with the issue as best she could by offering me compensation which was much appreciated- she is a real asset to the hotel. I think the error was made by BA, not the hotel, however, this was frustrating as I had emailed a couple of times before staying and had no response. Also, I was unaware of the daily culture charge when I booked.

I received a response a couple of days later that answered my questions and she apologized for the inconvenience. I think the hotel realizes that third party reservation companies tend to mislead customers and they obviously want to serve their guests better. Everyone makes mistakes, and problems arise, but it's the way someone or a company responds to that mistake or problem that is the measure of integrity.

I arrived late and got provbably the worst room in the hotel, facing the street on the second floor, above the restaurant. The room was really noisy, and I couldn't sleep. I asked to change the next day and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I got a room on a higher floor that was better situated but hadn't been updated in a while. The floor had paint stains and it was just tired looking and had no view (I could partially see a redbrick wall across). A large portion of the window (and natural light) was blocked by a large TV placed in the sill and the bed was very high.

Perhaps a bit of training is in order?Our stay was going downhill fast, with some of the items having significant personal value and they were not on display either.Finally, to add insult to injury, on departure, a wonderful $450 worth of Urban Tax slapped onto our bill. This ‘made up’ tax is causing havoc across the cities hotels apparently, as it’s basically money for old rope. We were told this tax pays for the hotel amenities including the WiFi! We paid it, gritted our teeth and left New York with a really bitter taste after having such a lovely time. Hotel manager said she would address our issues but that’s a load of nonsense. Almost 48hours later and we are now a distant memory for the hotel staff. Be very aware of some of these issues when booking. Your room rate is not the final rate you will pay!

After reading reviews it looked great, it was clean, modern and close to a subway! Simple and effective! Upon arrival we were greeted by wonderful staff members who were kind and polite and couldn’t do enough for us! This continued throughout the whole week we stayed there and every member of staff were a dream! We encountered a few problems (through no fault of the hotel) such as the alarm battery running low and the safe battery being low and the staff were so quick to sort these out for us within 5 minutes they came to our room and sorted out the problems! We were so grateful! The rooms were clean and tidy and kept to a high standard! The towels were replaced every day and I was very impressed with the room! There wasn’t much of a view out the window however this did not matter at all as we didn’t book the hotel to spend all our time in and a view was not a priority. There was lots of space in the room and bathroom and the beds were large and comfy! I cannot pick fault with the room at all! The bar downstairs had a great vibe every night with amazing bar staff who knew the ins and outs of every cocktail and were able to make me a bespoke cocktail based on drinks I enjoy - it was amazing! The bar had different entertainment on some nights such as an open mic night and a comedy night! Great vibes throughout! The restaurant next door (although we didn’t try) you could order a take out pizza and then eat it in the bar of the hotel! Overall an amazing stay in this hotel and when I return to New York I will be using this hotel again as it was a 10/10 experience! Great service and fantastic staff! Thank you for a lovely stay!

We were told the hotel is fully booked and all king superior rooms are as awful as this. But yesterday the person at the front desk did say we should be able to change rooms today. When I asked this morning the person at the front desk said no - we can’t change. This is it. She said all the ‘superior’ rooms are like this in this hotel. Our room is truly a tomb. A cave. A dungeon. You can’t tell what time of day it is outside - it’s always dark. View of a wall and some windows. The bed is okay. The room is clean. Only one chair. I will never stay here again.

(I guess that is quite a change, but just saying it was always lovely).All very classic and in keeping with the Upper West Side location. It’s the sort of place that attracts a well healed set (we spotted a movie star) and why wouldn’t it.

Valet parking went well. The room was small even for New York. Perhaps had I gotten a Queen or two Doubles instead of a King, I would have had more room. So while there was a desk chair, there was no room for an easy chair in what's supposed to be a Superior room, and it was difficult to maneuver around the room. There's a safe, but it's located down at the floor level next to the bed, so you have to bend down on hands and knees to operate it. There was a closet, so why not put it there where you could reach it? No recycling bin in the room for plastic or paper. No toilet paper dispenser, just a roll on a hook or knob. No grab bar in the shower. The bathroom did have lots of room for toiletries and stuff. Lighting in the room was very good. The lobby is spacious with lots of sitting areas and a bar. The hotel slaps on a resort fee of $39 a day that they call an ""Urban Fee,"" that includes simple things like water and internet access. I mean, come on!

Only concern was the cleanliness, I think the hotel needs to put more effort in their cleaning service especially in sweeping the floor and couch. But overall as a family we enjoyed our stay very much and recommend the hotel as it's family friendly and in a great neighborhood with so many attractions within walking distance and subway is just 2 blocks away.

Arthouse is great in so many ways, including its UWS location away from the fray yet with easy access to everything. However, this hotel’s staff is truly the ""ace up its sleeve."" I want particularly to thank front-desk staffers Jessie, Ramona, Carlos and Eloy who I have come to know over these past 4-5 years, for always being helpful, kind, warm and willing to answer and address any question I might have and for making me feel “at home”. Their sense of service is impeccable. Whenever I have had a particular room request, they always do their utmost to accommodate me. I also want to give a shout-out to Linasia and Amado for sending treats to my room during my last few stays in February and March 2019, when my mother was in a hospital nearby post-brain surgery, and I often got back to my room late at night. Their kindness and consideration were a comfort at an extremely difficult time. Credit must also be given to people working “behind the scenes”, so thank you Tasha in Customer Service for working to keep me in the same room when I suddenly had to extend my stay last winter and the hotel was jam-packed. And kudos to Rosa Carr, Reservations Manager, for ALWAYS being helpful, answering questions promptly and thoroughly. Also, if you are traveling with a dog, rest-assured that Arthouse is a welcoming place for your four-legged bestie! I have been a loyal guest at this hotel for a number of years, for the above-mentioned reasons, but in particular thanks to the hotel’s wonderful staff. As great as the Arthouse's “physical” qualities are –– the rooms, the ultra-comfy beds, the 16th floor balcony bar, the home-away-from-home lobby – in the end it’s above all the staff that keeps me coming back.

After staying here for two nights, we went to the JW Marriott. Finally we could get a good night's rest. Very unfortunate, as the Arthouse is a lovely-looking hotel.

We were very satisfied with the room (king bed with a view). We were very satisfied with house keeping, our room was cleaned very well each day. We were extremely displeased with the customer service of the front desk. We showed up to drop off our bags (around 12pm) knowing check in wasn’t until 4. This process took longer than expected, and the lady at the desk seemed annoyed that we showed up early. We were told we would get a call if our room was ready before 4pm and went along with our day. We came back to the hotel right at 4pm (never received that call) and a different woman stopped us before we could get to the desk. She very rudely tried to tell us we had not paid for our room/ our credit card info wasn’t right. She never asked our name or verified who we were. We were obviously very confused because we had already paid and we started to pull up of confirmation on our phone and she switched stories, obviously back tracking and said their system was down and we might not be checked in. We explained we had already checked in and dropped our bags, she looked really confused. Then we asked her to look up our account since she still hadn’t asked our name or any other information. Once she looked us up it was obvious she had bombarded the wrong people, we had checked in/paid. We were given no apology for her rude demeanor/ accusation. I’m still blown away with the way she stormed up to us before we got to desk without knowing who we were. This left a bad impression on us throughout the rest of the stay.

The rooms are very clean, the beds are comfortable and the lobby area is quite nice. The price is also very reasonable for NYC. There is also an Equinox Gym only 1 block away. You can buy a day pass there if you are not an Equinox member. The negative is that while housekeeping and staff in general are very pleasant and efficient front desk staff is consistently sub par. Too often front desk staff have been unhelpful and below what I experience in other hotels. Twice now I have asked for quiet rooms only to be placed next to the elevator. Both times my room was changed so there were other rooms available. It seems like just laziness or a lack of willingness to accommodate guests. One gentleman in particular stands out as being very poor and I have been checked in by him a few times in the past year. It is an unfortunate welcome or lack of welcome to an otherwise nice hotel. I usually book a Superior King room or above. I have noticed that the Superior King rooms vary in size which is odd. Usually hotel rooms in the same category are pretty similar in size. I will likely stay here again because of the pluses. However I now anticipate a sub par check in experience and a lack of certainty of what size room I will get since there does not appear to be consistency. You should also know that you need to go above the King Superior class room to get an armchair in your room although many of the King Superiors do have room for them.

(In this case, Broadway and 77th Street.) For years I went to the same UWS hotel--which I still like, but it has not changed its decor or vibe in the last ten years. The Arthouse, on the other hand, is a revelation--it feels and looks trendy and cozy at the same time.The lobby has two levels with a softly lit bar on the street level that offers a fun place for a quick drink or for a long night of lively conversation with friends. The bar also features a red baby grand piano with music representative of an old Manhattan supper club. Don't get me wrong, the music is current, but not at all intrusive. I could actually hear my companions talk.The check-in area, which is small, is on the second level of the lobby. Also located there is a very big lounge area with a fireplace, overstuffed chairs and sofas--even a table set up for chess.The rooms are very comfortable, very clean, and the decor is loft-worthy. I had a king room and my companions had a doubles suite. Excellent beds, toiletries, and linens. The rooms and halls actually have original art (hence the name Arthouse) which makes the hotel feel more like an apartment than a sterile cookie-cutter hotel. Our rooms had street views with lots of light. I do, however, think a rug underneath the beds woulds soften the hard surface floors.The staff is courteous and friendly and gave us vouchers for a free drink and a bottle of wine for each room. Very, very nice touches--thank you.I came on a slightly less expensive day, so the prices were not too bad considering it is NYC. On other days, the hotel can be very expensive so flexibility will save you some money.The check-in procedure was all right, but I wasn't happy when I was told if I wanted an early check-in it would be an extra $50.00. I travel to NYC about four times a year and never heard of this practice. The other issue, which is why I gave only a 4-star vs. a 5-star, is the ""resort fee"". Come on! I think the fee was about $40-45.00 extra per room. Please stop with this nonsense and just tell us how much the room costs. Don't hide the real price behind a resort fee. I know this is a trend in the hotel business, but it has to stop. Maybe the Arthouse can lead the way. Just tell us how much the room really costs and let your guests decide if your hotel and location are worth the price.I think it is worth the price and plan to return with my husband very soon.Side note: I wasn't impressed with the breakfast at Serafina (an adjacent restaurant) The service was awful and their ""basket of breads"" was a croissant or toast--not both. There is a Starbuck's around the corner as an alternative. Please note that I used to like Serafina for lunch and dinner--maybe this time was just a fluke.","Orange, CT","Irene S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange, CT</strong>",117,4.0

A quick internet search reveals this is a frowned-upon practice employed by some unscrupulous hotels to avoid paying tax. If this isn't enough to put you off I would describe the hotel as roomier than a travelodge but more dated.

I fell asleep and woke up 2 hours later and it had never been delivered. I called and told them I would just get it the next day.

The elevators are an issue. They are small and slow, and at all times only one side was working. The workers use the same elevators so you are always sharing with housekeeping and maintenance or waiting for the next available to come because it is full. I spent more time on the stairs than I did riding an elevator. Get a high floor. Just about every night there is a party or reception in the lobby with loud music.

Our daughter moved to Manhattan 15 years ago then to the Upper West Side 4 years ago. That is when we discovered the Arthouse, formerly the NYLO and we loved it!  When our daughter decided to be married in the Conservatory Gardens with a reception at the Loab Boathouse in Central Park, one of the guest services staff at the desk suggested we think about the Arthouse for our out of town guests which turned out to be one of the best suggestions through the wedding planning process. We chose the Arthouse as the hotel for our family and friends because of its convenience to Central Park (the wedding venue) as well as its easy access restaurants, museums, and shops, without the chaos of other parts of the city. Yet there is easy access to other parts of the city by walking or subway. And it is in a relatively quiet area of the city with schools and residential neighborhoods all around. There is also a great bar in the hotel lobby area which is converted to a bakery coffee shop/ cafe named Patis during the early part of the day which has the best bagel you will ever eat!  Some of our guests had rarely or never been to NYC so they were a bit nervous about the experience. We created gift bags for the guests which included maps and guides to the city provided by the Arthouse which the desk staff graciously pressed to guests upon their arrival. That certainly increased their comfort level as well as the fact that the decor of the lobby area is warm and inviting. We also arranged a drop in on the event before the wedding which included appetizers from 2 selected Arthouse caterers and drinks from the Arthouse bar. It was held in the library which is an area off the bar. Everything was perfect that evening. We used the loft suite for the bride to get ready the next day which also worked out perfectly.  From the moment we began the planning with the sales team to the event coordinator to the guest service staff to the bell hop staff to the custodial staff to the bartenders to the various managers of the Arthouse our experience and that of our guests could not have been more perfect. Whether you are coming for an overnight or a week, for business or pleasure, we are convinced it is the best place in the city to stay, home away from home! ",,FarAway584371,0,5.0

The room a Superior king was exceptionally comfortable and clean. On the 8th floor at the rear it was also quiet. The room was a good size and had a good range of toiletries and a nice coffee machine. The room was serviced daily and replenished. It’s a very welcome place to relax at the end of an exhausting day in NYC. Unfortunately a lift broke down on Friday evening and still wasn’t repaired when we left on Wednesday. This did present a delay when wanting to get to and from the room. We did try the stairs but were very surprised to find they are a storage area for house keeping and of all sorts of things. Clearly different rules for fire exits in the USA. As in the UK they have to be kept clear. I had a coffee and a pastry one morning in the bar. Which becomes Patis Bakery during the morning. It was delicious but quite pricey at over $10 for coffee and a pastry. We can highly recommend the bagel shop round the corner on Amsterdam called the Bagel Stop. Doesn’t look much from the outside but the bagels are delicious. On Sunday the queue was up the street! We did also eat in Serafina one evening. My meal was lovely but again over priced. We ate at the State Bar and Grill in the Empire State and had 3 courses for comparatively less, and it was 100 x better. But to be fair this is not part of the hotel and so is not reflected in my star rating. Overall The ArtHouse is a clean and a very comfortable place to stay in New York in a quiet location. It has a trendy feel and is very pleasant. But it is impersonal, we stayed 5 nights and I don’t think anyone noticed us. I would recommend as long as you moderate your expectations and think of it more as a very up market Hilton Express or similar you be on the right lines.

I am extremely fussy when it comes to mattress quality and sleep quality at a hotel. The Arthouse really delivered on both fronts. Rooms are a decent size (we had a king), it's in a great location, the bar is fun and well served (but they do need to fix the horrible flickering lights above the bar - several people agreed that they couldn't sit there because it was making them feel ill). Next for restaurant Serafina is good for breakfast and the dimsum restaurant Red Farm is pricey but superb. Both are part of the hotel block. One complaint on pillows: they were too soft and had no structure so bunched up. I brought my own pillow but my husband was uncomfortable at times. They didn't have any other types of pillows.

What seems like it should be a luxury hotel in a great area quickly faded into something much less for us. Some of the most flagrant customer service oversights included (but are in no way limited to);1. Having a massive leak wake us up around 4:30 AM and getting a seriously zero response from the hotel staff. We had to take care of using our trash can to prevent water leaking all over our hotel room and using all our towels to keep our room from flooding. The hotel didn’t even follow up with us in the following days on the issue and see if we were ok, additionally we had to call several times to get more towels the following day and explain why we had no dry towels left in our room. 2. ‘Connie Wang” is allegedly the hotel GM and emails you a boiler plate message to reach out personally should you need anything. To say the least, I reached out and never heard back, not even a “she’s away right now” message. When you open yourself to your guests to be at their service it is essential to follow through. I’m thoroughly unimpressed by the lack of follow through here. If there is or ever was a Connie Wang General Manager of Arthouse Hotel I assure you she made every effort NOT to make herself available to me in my time of urgent need and distress. Expect nothing. 3. I find if extremely insulting that on my very last night of a 7 night stay, you decide to deliver a “welcome note” and complimentary bottle of red Spanish wine. Wow. Really? All I want is to have my room leak addressed and to speak with the Gm and my last night what should have been in my room from when I first walked in is sitting there? Amazing. Would not recommend staying here unless you get a killer price or you just don’t care about sub par service for $300-400 per night.

NY is expensive so I was expecting it. Loved the ambiance of the hotel. It’s not a huge chain hotel and that was the charm. It had an eclectic décor. Modern yet funky. The bar area was great with a garage door that was up since the weather was so nice. You were inside yet outside. Our room was on the 11th floor overlooking Broadway. Room was small, but that was expected too. Surprisingly little street noise. There was a Keurig so you get some coffee before you started your day. No issue with Wifi. They have a nice outdoor terrace on the 14th? Floor. We took advantage of that in the evening when we got back to the hotel. Very nice place to have a cocktail. I can’t tell you a time when every employee of a hotel greeted you and asked how is your stay, but they did at The Arthouse. Even texted me a few times to ask how everything was. Very friendly staff. They have a restaurant connected to the hotel, Serafina. We ate there one night. Had a great Bolognese. Also, had breakfast (average) there before we checked out. Convenient.

When we arrived, the check in tried to book us into a similar but non accessible room saying only that we ""received an upgrade"". Had I not been there for check in, they would have been in real trouble - getting a straight answer that we had indeed booked an accessible room and that they were trying to put us in a non accessible room was like pulling teeth. No one was able to help except for one very busy manager. After a very long minute wait, she sent us to a room we wouldn't be staying in to wait for the new room, that is a tough trip for an elderly couple who just wants to get settled after a long day of travel (we checked in 5-6 hours after normal check in time, so our room not being ready is not ok). We were stranded in a room they wouldn't be staying in and an hour later we were moved to the right room but only after several calls to pressure them to move us. The new ADA room had beds that were way too high for an accessible room / elderly person, the bathroom had no hot water, and the bathroom was like a skating rink after a shower with no bars to navigate out of the room for those who are not in a wheel chair -- this created a very dangerous situation. The room was on the 2nd floor and had only one chair even though a the jr. suite picture on the website had 2 chairs and a desk and said that the units are only located on the 14-16th floors - I feel we didn't even get what we booked, but I can't be sure because this was not explained. To top it off, one of the jr. employees at the front desk said something to the effect of ""I know it must be hard travelling with family this age"" which is really condescending - It's hard travelling when the hotel doesn't provide what it advertises. At the outset before most of the other issues were even experienced the manager offered $100 off of the room. At the end, she explained that she would see what else she could do and correspond with me over email. Days later and no one emailed me except for an automated feedback form. When I submitted this review to the feedback form, the hotel's response came from a no-reply email address to which I couldn't reply!

The location of the Arthouse is great, being on upper west 77th street, close to bars and restaurants and walking distance of Central Park and the national history museum. The hotel lobby is nice and the guys and the door are friendly, but unfortunately that stops at the door. The staff at the check in desk did not make an effort to make us feel welcome. A credit card was taken even though we’d paid for our room, the lady assured us the room tax had been paid and nothing would be charged to the card, however this was not the case, each day a random amount would be taken out, when querying this we were told is was the ‘urban tax’ which we were not informed about at check in, apparently this is for the use of the hotels amenities, even though they didn’t inform of us of any of these. I would think the staff should have to inform you at check in about the ‘urban tax’ and what its for and where these facilities are, especially considering we were told nothing would be charged to our card. Moving on we found our room 820, we had no help with our bags, the 3 guys we passed just watched us. The room was very dark with no natural light at all, both windows were facing buildings. We couldn't see the sky at all. This upset me as I’d emailed the hotel twice, once on booking it back in October 2018 then again closer to our arrival date. I’d mentioned it’s was our belated honeymoon due to my mum passing and we would really appreciate a room with a nice view, so as you can imagine I was shocked to see they hadn’t even given a second thought about our experience at this hotel or even trying to make it that bit more special. There are lots of hotels in this area, for me it’s the customer service that sets them apart, unfortunately the Arthouse is lacking a great deal in this. I would not recommend this hotel, as I said before there are abundance’s of hotels in this area.","Greater Manchester, United Kingdom","Vicki B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greater Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",22,3.0

I frequently stay in lower manhattan but had reason to stay uptown and was trying to find a nice, clean hotel at a decent price - I found it! We needed two rooms for 1 night, and then unexpectedly stayed a second night, so we ended up with 2 different rooms, so I got to see 4 different rooms. They were all very spacious and the modern minimalist decor (which was very attractive) and wood floors (no carpet! Yay!) added to the feel of openness. The rooms were spotlessly clean. The lobby area is really attractive and inviting with several different spaces to be, good art and big open doors. They also give you a welcome drink coupon for wine and it was really nice to sit by the piano with a glass of prosecco. And really, I can’t say enough about the staff. Everyone was exceptionally nice! We were greeted every time we came in, the bell staff was friendly and chatted with us. And the front desk staff went over and above helping us when I found a problem with my reservation made by an online booking company. The woman at the desk made lots of calls to get it resolved for us. My elderly mother was traveling with us and she said her only “suggestions” for the hotel were to add some extra hooks in the bathroom near to the shower and add some additional lights to the rooms.

On all three occasions the desk staff and also the handy man were polite and more than happy to help us.The room was nicely clean and we were lucky in that when we arrived, having booked the smallest and most basic room option, Jessie on the front desk saw that a much larger room usually reserved for wheelchair users was free and allocated that to us as it wasnt booked up. This was great as it gave us a very spacious room and bathroom. Jessie also sent us a bottle of wine up to the room free of charge.The bed was the comfiest hotel bed I have ever slept on, with lovely soft sheets and nice pillows. All were changed during the duration of our stay too, which was lovely.The cocktails at the bar downstairs were also well made and delicious.The few things that I would say - more in the hope that Arthouse read this an consider these points - than as real criticisms:(1) The lobby is super cool and clearly recently renovated, but the room (that we had - cant speak for others) could do with a bit of an update to bring it up to the standard of the lobby. The decor seemed slightly older and there were a few things that could have done with attention, such as the shower control being loose and wobbly and a mark on one wall behind a bedside table where someone had clearly dropped something like red wine and stained the paint.(2) The air con system was very loud and a little intrusive for me as a light sleeper.(3) The bar staff were not that quick on the uptake. There was more than one occasion where we would have bought drinks had the staff come up to us, but after waiting for upto 10 minutes we decided to go out instead.We would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to explore nyc, but also escape the busy-ness at the end of the day.Thanks for a great trip, Arthouse!",,SEA1988_1,0,5.0

The walls are also either very thin or the doors are too heavy as loud slamming could be heard from the early hours which was highly irritating.The staff are the highlight but could be a bit hit and miss.Free cocktail with the resort fee was a massive plus with a great bar and bartender, however upon arrival to our room the bottled water had been opened and sipped from so we had to call down and request new bottles. Whilst they apologised (and upon checking out very graciously removed most of our resort fee) it was a bit of a rooky error on the part of house keeping as they had quite clearly been consumed from. Just not really what i've come to expect from a 4 star hotel experience.I've also not been to a 4star hotel where a fridge was not already in the room so that was a bit strange, especially given the ice machine was broken so we had to keep requesting ice from the bar in the lobby.All in all I would say you probably get what you pay for.","London, United Kingdom","Charmaineluvsu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",60,3.0

I’m in NYC a couple times a month, so this is not culture shock. Just a “room” that should be part of the hallway instead. Doormen are very pleasant and eager to help. Front desk is nothing special. Very sorry we booked here, especially since we could stay elsewhere in the city for about $300-$350/night (I just checked). But room is non-refundable, so we are stuck here.

Despite some issues during checking in ( both my cards were declined twice, but this was swiftly remedied by a senior staff member's intervention ) , the stay was very good. Vivek and Eduardo can handle any of your service, luggage or car needs and for someone like me who tends to sleep late, an afternoon request for room service never was an issue ( unlike some hotels where it seems this is rarely possible and sometimes only clean towels are offered ). The location of this hotel cannot be beat, as it is a quiet and safe neighborhood but only a short cab or subway ride away from anywhere you would like to visit ( The Met, Central Park, eateries and bookstores ) . April weather brought the usual showers but only one day saw rain for the duration. Booking via the hotel's own website always seems to bring the best rates and the ""standby upgrade"" is a great option - I upgraded to a king room for $80 for the whole 5 nights, well worth it for the extra space.

On the other hand, we were staying in a deluxe deluxe queen room (a couple with 2 kids) but the picture on their internet site is extremely misleading. Indeed, our room was large, with three windows... on a wall, meaning extremely dark with absolute no view. We stayed 12 nights, we had no discount and they apparently could not find any solution to move us to another upstairs room despite two requests or still on the 4th floor on the street (so extremely noisy as there is a FDNY house + some pavement reconstruction...). So between being able to sleep at night and be in the dark all time, you have to choose, so be careful!!! Also, the floor cleaning was never done, we again had to request it (vaccum cleaning). What they do on a daily basis is the bed (comfortable) and changing the towels + the shampoo... no bathroom cleaing (shower) neither (hair...). In the end, the bill was about 5800 USD for these 12 nights which reprensents a real budget for us with no special consideration (except 1 drink out of 12 nights and no choice of the drink! quite niggardly) to say the least. I know it's difficult to find a good hotel in NYC as the ratio quality/price is extremely difficult to find... Not sure I will recommand that hotel. As said, very mixed feelings...

Even so, I wish to dedicate the bulk of the review to the man who single-handly made my trip memorable: the doorman, Orlando. From the moment my family stepped onto the curb from our car, he gracefully helped us with our luggage, acting not just as the doorman, but as the concierge. His kind attitude was infectious, and as my family was checked in, he kindly waited to guide us through the intricate system of elevators. Once we arrived at our room, we were actually left shocked at the small size of the bedroom; the wall was at most two feet from the end of the bed. My mother and I quickly called down to the lobby to ensure that this was the right room. We don't typically fuss; when they assured us this was our room, we shrugged and went to help Orlando unload. At no point did we complain, and yet, soon after he had left, Orlando called back, offering us a new room, much larger than the first. His kindness and generosity made our entire trip fantastic!

The front receptionist initiated an early check-in as we requested and was warm and friendly. We were informed that we'd receive a call when the room was available and our bags (which were securely checked in) would be in the room upon our arrival later on. We spent the day in the city and arrived later than anticipated - were tired and wanted to cozy up in our room. We checked at the front and were informed our bags were not in the room and could carry them up ourselves OR have the bellhop bring them up. Since we were so tired we asked if the bellhop could bring up the bags (though we were upset that they were not there as previously informed). The bellhop brought up our bags, we thanked him kindly and bid him farewell, he did not reply to our farewell but instead stood at the door waiting for a tip. We did not think it was appropriate to expect a tip for bringing luggage that SHOULD HAVE been in the room to start with. The fact that the bellhop expected a tip for merely doing his job and did not wish as a goodnight back when he did not receive a tip was of poor taste. The following night, we again arrived to the hotel late and tired after a full day in the city; we requested our ""complimentary drinks"" which were tasteless and seemed to have been made with low quality alcohol. As far as the room is concerned, the bathroom shower had mold and did not reflect the appearance of a place that keeps up with cleaning routines. On our check-out day, the housekeeper DEMANDED that we take off the ""do not disturb sign"" off the door knob so that she could clean as soon as we left the room and did not have to wait until later on to do so. We felt rushed and unattended. We were not impressed which was a shame because we were referred by a friend who stayed at this hotel some years back.

About an hour later, they called us notifying us that our room was ready. Very impressed. To compare, our family had to wait in the lobby for more than 3 hours to check into a nearby 5 star property.

I would easily rate this a 3/3.5 star property.As a Gold expedia member, I had a VIP gift which was two free drinks. The free drinks were somewhat underwhelming. The wine I had was sadly terrible and my husband's beer tasted like water. We did not finish our drinks and left.

Superb location with easy access to subway (on W79th St). My wife loved it as across the street you find convenient store, pharmacy and Marshall's plus a number of restaurants. Central Park is within walking distance. The room is of a good size not too small considering this is NYC. We're traveling with our 8 year-old. A rollaway bed was wheeled in after our request FOC and can be placed at the foot of the existing bed with no problem. The window could hardly be opened and the view from our room was another building wall but that was not a problem as we were out and about all day and only return to sleep. A spacious sitting/working area in the lobby with 30 minutes complimentary use of their computer and printer - very convenient in case you need to print something. The work area also has a power sockets for you to plug in your laptop. Almost everything was thought of with the design. What I like very much is that there are more than enough power outlets in the room to plug your appliances. We could charge at the same time our 2 iPhones, 1 iPad, 2 Powerbank chargers, 2 battery chargers for our cameras, my electrical toothbrush and a hairdryer. It was great.

The property needs to be updated and is showing wear. Two main issues I have are our room was right outside the elevator and it was very loud. you can hear everyone coming and going. I would make sure you don't get a room near the elevator. It was a bit disappointing because we were there five nights and you would think the staff would have put us in a better room. The housekeeping was very poor. Out of 5 nights there were 3 days we did not get any towels and had to call down. The first time it took well over an hour to get the towels and when I went to the front desk I was told there was nothing that could be done until someone from housekeeping was available to deliver towels. Not sure why that takes an hour. Plus having this happen 3 out of 5 nights seems like poor QC. The lobby is very warm and the bar is nice to hang. Again, you can't beat the location, close to the subway, food, the park and its great if you like the UWS. Rooms are small, even for NYC, and the room we had did not have a dresser.

Right after a congenial Arthouse manager processed my check in, I went to my assigned hotel room, opened the door and walked through what has to be one of my most favorite NYC hotel rooms that I ever stayed at to date. In particular, this hotel suite was artistically designed using soft paint colors, lightly stained sanded wood floors juxtaposed with modern classical elements, such as Scandinavian furniture that together evokes an overall lasting sentiment of total relaxation. The suite itself included: a very large bedroom with a king sized ultra comfortable bed, huge flat screen TV and long writer’s desk; a living room with a floral print couch, white leather chair, varnished wood desk and a well appreciated, very good coffee maker; a bathroom with a white porcelain sink and glass encased smartly designed shower that easily allows two people to shower together and two spectacular terraces whereby one faced easterly and the other, westerly with a lovely view of the Henry Hudson River. For the entire duration of my stay I felt incredibly peaceful and content Arthouse is an exceptionally well run hotel whereby their entire hotel staff pay extra special attention to what perhaps all hotel patrons desire, which is to be treated as if they are “very important people”. The staff here could not be any more accommodating even if they wanted to because they all perform their jobs in such an outstanding manner. I want to mention Edmond, who is a bell captain and who always provided any assistance if need with the most cheerful friendly attitude. I very much enjoyed spending time in hotel lobby that has an excellent Italian restaurant, Serafina, an inviting two sided drinking bar that serves a variety of special red and white wines by the glass as well as excellent mixed cocktails and beers, several sitting/reading/rooms (one is a state-of-the-art business center) furnished with a myriad of couches, chairs, lamps and wood or glass coffee tables. Arthouse is located on the Upper West side at 77th and Broadway in a terrific Manhattan location and I highly recommend it to anyone coming to visit NYC. It has such a wonderful positive energy throughout the entire hotel that when you depart you will feel completely recharged. Personally speaking, I would love to live here but I can settle for revisiting as often as I can afford to. Thanks again to the entire Arthouse (NYLO) family, specifically, Carlos, Tasha, Vivek and Rebecca for making my entire stay so incredibly and throughly enjoyable.

I was looking for a reasonable price, though this was booked as part of a package with Expedia. This I felt was the best hotel which was closest to our requirements.First impressions were that it almost looked like a English pub, on the left as you enter the small lobby is the bar, on the right some comfy chairs with a couple of computer desks for limited customer use, 30 mins max.The check in was fine and we had a deluxe king size corner room on the 8th floor. It was a good size with a tv and bedside tables. The TV had approximately 60 channels which is not big by USA standards, no uk football on it, just thought I would mention that. The bathroom has a bath with shower and small basin, it did feel cold in the mornings The heating can come on the night if it gets chilly and we did not seem to be able to change the temp control.There is wardrobe with some hangers provided and a few cupboards to put clothes in. The bed base was shiny hence the mattress easily slid on it, so we had to keep pushing it back.The staff were helpful if needed and the bar was atmospheric but when the main door to the hotel entrance was opened on occasions you got a chill wind. There is a 24 hour CVS across the road which you can get pharmacy items plus soft drinks and beers. Turning right out of the hotel a walk of two minutes to the end of the block and you come into Amsterdam Avenue, which takes you to midtown, in the first block you come to a small coffee and bakery shop and a dunkin doughnuts and a restaurant called TESSA, which I reviewed, and some bars as well.The hotel just a few minutes walk from metro stations, red route 1, which takes you downtown to battery park via World Trade Centre and Lincoln Centre and the intersection for Columbus Circle, up town is to the Bronx.You can walk to Central Park within 30 mins, 25 mins to Lincoln Centre and 10 mins to The Natural History Museum.Generally the hotel is in a quiet area, but the fire station is in the same road as the hotel so obviously on occasions you do the fire engines. On this point the soundproof in our room was not great.In conclusion the stay was enjoyable and a different experience from a midtown hotel and hopefully the little extra info I provided will be useful. Oh yeas and Irvine Farm Coffee House is nearby, which I will review and a liquor store and Katzs deli is close to.","Pulborough, United Kingdom","Nick S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pulborough, United Kingdom</strong>",58,4.0

Found this place while planning a trip with my daughter to NYC the weekend before Christmas 2018. It is a 3 minute walk to the Beacon Theater, a 10 minute walk to the American Museum of Natural History and Central Park. Cab ride to Time Square/Rockefeller center area averaged $9-$10. The hotel itself was overall excellent. The doormen where nice quick to hold the door and assist guests as they walked in. The initial feel when my daughter and I walked in was, ""This place is pretty cool"". There is a business lounge area as soon as you walk in that is spacious with a modern look. Upon checking in, the service was good. The front desk clerk was kind and accommodating. The overall cleanliness was great .Only cleanliness issue, which wasn't a big deal at all, the mirrors behind the front desk looked like they could use some cleaning or replacing. I couldn't tell if it was spotty or if the mirror finish was coming off. (I'm nit picking here). The room we got had an awesome view of Broadway and for NYC standards, the size of the room was pretty good. (The majority of my stays in NYC, the rooms have been SMALLL...) Our room had a king size bed that was super comfortable. The furniture and fixtures in both the bedroom and bathroom were modern. My daughter and I thought the overall look was cool. The hotel didn't have old smelly carpets like I feel I run into from time to time in hotels. The Bar and lounge has a cool feel too, with a big red piano and plenty of places to sit and relax. The bartender, Christian, was great! Personable and had lots of tips and suggestions when I asked and didn't make me feel like I was annoying him. My first trip to that bar, the bartender that day was not so good... I never caught his name, because he spent the majority of his time complaining to a coworker, about his bosses and/or coworkers.

They offer a free drink when you arrive and the rooms are nice. Handling issues, however, is not their forte. My boyfriend and I checked in fine and then went out to explore. We get back around midnight to realize our room keys weren’t working. I go downstairs to inform them and they ask me if I’m sure I’m using my key for the correct room because the system says I am in a diffeeent room. I show them the key holder they gave me that morning with the room key that says I’m in room 503 (where all of our belongings already are). Then, they tell me they made a mistake and I have to move to another room, with ZERO explanation or compensation. It’s extremely late at night, we are wanting to go to bed and you’re making us get all of our belongings and move them somewhere else? Not to mention a DOWNGRADED ROOM. Then in the morning we ask to speak to the manager. She comes out and tells us she’s aware of what happened and we won’t have to pay the $40 hotel fee and next time we come we will get a free upgrade. I found that funny — we already didn’t have to pay the hotel fee because we are Expedia VIP gold members (we were told at check in), and in order to receive a free upgrade you’re telling me I need to pay to stay here another night?

Voucher for a free drink at the bar given on arrival. “Complementary” bottled water restocked in the room each day. Like everywhere in Manhattan, there’s an extra urban tax that’s charged each night that isn’t included in the room rate which typically accounts for stuff like bottled water and wifi. The odd part was that the urban tax charged was different each night, though when totalled it averaged out to be around what was quoted. Small terrace seemed like a decent spot to lounge, though we didn’t really use the area. Staff was mediocre, not overly helpful or knowledgeable but I don’t expect much help when in NY.

Nothing serious, but small things here and there all the time.Firstly, the room pricing is made complex and confusing, probably on purpose. A room has a price, but extras, taxes and fees are not quoted. They list some of the extras, taxes and fees, but say that there may be more. After I had made the reservation (directly in hotel) I asked the hotel to confirm the total price of my stay, but they chose not to reply. When checking in I asked to confirm the total price of my stay, but I only got a list of the room prices, and a statement that an “urban fee” will be applied, but nothing else. When checking out the reception handed out to me 7 pages of printout without any explanation. It appeared that the hotel had charged to my credit card a sum, which in addition to the room charges included the following items: Sales tax, City tax, Urban fee, Urban fee sales tax, Urban fee city tax, Javits tax, Occupancy tax, Room upgrade, Upgrade sales tax and Upgrade city tax. And all this separately for each night. The sums probably are correct, but I cannot see any other reason for listing the prices in this way, but trying to confuse the customer. Then secondly, the hotel was trying to cheat in small things here and there. Example: The lobby bar advertised happy hour with a special price $8 for a beer. I ordered a beer during happy hours and received it without any comments. But then the check asked me to pay double price $16 (plus tax and tip, of course). When complaining, I got the answer: ”the happy hour beer is finished”. Not a big deal, but pathetic and unprofessional - and a small thing made the customer unhappy. Another example: Reservation confirmation quoted that the stay is subject to ”urban fee” of $31 per night. When checking out I was charged $35 per night. The explanation was that the fee had been increased - and the reception person really looked like she felt that the hotel can increase the quoted fees as they like. Again, not a big deal but humiliated the customer. Then finally, after checkout I accepted the hotel offer to arrange a taxi transfer to Kennedy airport. They quoted ”fixed price including taxes, tolls and tips”. But after two blocks of driving the driver said he thinks the traffic is slow in the area of a toll-free bridge, and that he wants to take another bridge instead where the traffic is better - but where I have to pay $8.50 extra toll. After I had just paid $5000 for a stay in the hotel, I would have expected they drive me to the airport for free. But instead, they chose to squeeze an extra $8.50 out of me. This was my last stay in this hotel. But if someone does not care if his bill becomes a thousand dollars more or less, this hotel is a nice choice in NY UWS.",Helsinki,"Tap1000</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Helsinki</strong>",4,2.0

I stayed many years ago before it switched names. They redesigned the lobby so that it has many seating areas where you can chill, have a drink or work which I loved. The room was ample, quiet and well appointed although no bathrobes. On site restaurant Serafina is a chain and not very good. However the doorman pointed me to several very good restaurants. I have learned to ask doormen for restaurant recommendations rather than hotel concierges. Front desk was consistently a bit clueless. I couldn't understand the man who checked me in and he did not give me the free drink tickets. I also got caught in NYC during an early season snow storm and my flight out was canceled. The front desk said there were no rooms available and didn't even offer to put me on a wait list. However I kept checking on line and rooms opened up which made some logical sense. Incoming flights were also being canceled so at some point logically rooms would open up. When the room opened the front desk wouldn't honor the online rate I got at the hotels' website which seemed silly so I had to book on the site and come back and the rate was extremely high likely to high demand because of the storm. When I came back to the desk the woman kept insisting the room type I booked was not available and i would have to pay for a more expensive room even though I had the confirmation number. I just waited a few minutes and waited online with another woman who found the room. At least this time I got the drink tickets.In spite of the problems I would stay again. Great location and the lobby really makes the hotel. While front desk staff was clueless aside from the man who initially checked me in they all seemed quite nice.","West Hollywood, California","larover</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Hollywood, California</strong>",175,4.0

You're also within reasonable walking distance of Chelsea, Central Park, and the museums/galleries.The condition of the room was alright. Not terrible, not amazing, just... meh.

The staff was very nice and friendly, the room is clean, it's in a very nice central part of town. However, if you're a light sleeper or you're there on business, I highly recommend you stay somewhere else. This hotel uses paper for walls. We paid for a really nice room, and we can hear our neighbors chatting, the people above us walking, room doors closing, etc. Early in the morning, you can hear cars honking on the road and people yelling outside the hotel. I've never stayed in a hotel where I can literally hear everything. And just to throw it out there, I'm not a light sleeper. For the price we paid, I expected something more. We stayed there for 3 nights, and after 2 nights in our very noisy room, we requested a room change. The man at the front desk was accommodating, but didn't mention that he would have to downgrade us. Which was no big deal, since we did request for a room change. However, he put us right by a high trafficked elevator. We made it clear that the room we were in was very noisy, which was why we requested the room change. but he didn't bother telling us that he was going to move us to an even noisier area. What was the point of us downgrading our room and moving then? It's a very cute and nice hotel. But next time we're in the city, we will stay at our tried and true hotel.

There was no room for even a chair andonly one person could fit in the bathroom at a time.it didn’t help that the on,y window faced a brick wall so we had no daylight.

I'm not sure if I would use the term boutique to describe the hotel but it does have a trendy feel and is certainly not bland.

As I said Central Park is miniutes away and a great place to take time out from the city. I must say that we walked around without concern or hesitation. Indeed, there is an amazing deli come supermarket very nearby where you can supplement your requirements for additional snacks and stuff. The service was descrete and and attentive. In fact all the staff could not have been more helpful. Jessie for example was particularly warm and welcoming and helped us settle in, arranging an upgrade to a junior suite with a balcony. (Upgrade recommended if you prefer more space). From my experience, room upgrades are usually negotiable on arrival and usually worth the extra cost.

The resort fees covered a welcome beer and then we got into the slow lifts to the fourth floor overlooking Broadway Avenue. There is no fridge, so we ordered a small little beat up bar fridge that arrived promptly. The Kuerig coffee machine was well stocked but I can vouch for the cups being plastic disposables in the bathroom (weird). The shower leaked and the bathroom did seem oddly dated from the loft-style Scandi-inspired LEGO bedroom furniture (you will get it if you stay here). The beds were comfortable and our double queen room had a sitting area with a two-seater lounger. On W77th Street, where the lobby is located we failed to see the fire station (or Ladder Company ##), but they made themselves known to us every hour on the hour, day and night responding to burnt toast alarms in the many surrounding high rises. The Battle of Britain-style wailing moans and horn honks our family started imitating even in our broken sleep over our 6-night stay. OK, it's NY, and a big city - but still annoying if you have children trying to get some shuteye. As other reviews will attest the location of this property near the 79th Street local subway or the 72nd street express service will put you in easy reach of all the tourist spots (Statue of Liberty ferry, 9/11 memorial, Times Square, Theatre District etc etc) and walking distance to the Mus of Nat Hist and Central Park. The attached Serafina Restaurant is underwhelming. The next door Asian restaurant RedFarm is an absolute rip off. And the Viand Cafe (W75-76) or Cafe 82 (W82nd street) were family gems. But there are plenty of options for a range of travellers for food and other amenities.I do have to mention a weird feature of this hotel is that it seems to attract a few well-known people (or maybe it was just that there was a concert in Central Park during our stay) whose private cars block the valet, their hangers-on loiter around the bar and lifts, and sometimes detracts from the appeal of the property. It is an odd feature of American hotels and specifically the NYLO that the door staff size you up quite early in your stay, and if you are not deemed to be a constant source of additional income you are spurned their attention - which might actually be a bonus. However, when you combine the group near the front door who may or may not be actual employees of the property, and the other hangers-on it is a weird feeling to foray past them multiple times a day. I would not recommend this property to family stays but might suit solo business travellers or couples who might not feel the above are detractors...",,James G,7,2.0

The king bed was comfortable and the bathroom was recently partially-updated, new shower and sink.The main issues were the ambient noise within and outside of the hotel. Both could be heard easily, although I will say the music from the lobby bar directly beneath us was very faint. The room did occasionally have a slight smell of garbage upon entering the room. This did not occur all the time, so I'm not sure from where exactly it could have been coming. Midway through the stay they did have emergency water heater repair which took 2 hours, which is understandable, but it took an additional two hours of running the hot water to clear the lines of brown sediment/dirt.Other than those issues, the location was great for us.

The atmosphere is friendly and hip, so we felt welcomed and definitely a part of the NYC vibe. The bar was decent, the in-hotel restaurant [Serafina] was quite good for breakfast [don't know why it gets so panned on Yelp], and it was a fantastic location for what we wanted. Nicely away from the tourist trap that is Times Square. We definitely felt secure in terms of safety, etc. The only two minor drawbacks - and we agreed that they fell into the ""well, we're in the city"" - were poor water pressure and that the NYFD station, which was literally across the street, was very active one of the nights we were there.

They also received some deliveries for me! The concierge (I forgot his name) was also very helpful during my stay. Lobby was nice and welcoming. Only complaint about the lobby was that there were some insects buzzing around, but no one can be blamed about this really. Everything about the room was clean and neat. Towels and toiletries were replaced every day. Coffee/Tea and water was replaced everyday. The bed was soft and comfortable. Bed linen was fresh and clean. The room I was in was spacious for one person. Wifi in room was good and I dont remember it dropping. USB charging points available on the bedside pedestals, which was very convenient. Elevators worked fine and didn't take too long to get me where I needed to be. There is a bar in the lobby. Complimentary drink vouchers are given when you check in and are valid for a few days after check-in. You can take your drink up to the terrace and get a great view of the surrounding river and city.

Central park is a 10 minute walk away, but if you want to check out the Loeb boathouse and famous statues (alice in wonderland, balto, etc) you will have to walk much further. The natural history museum is also around a 10 minute walk straight up the road from the hotel. The hotel has the Serafina restaurant attached (delivery to your room is possible). It is slightly pricey, but the food/drinks are good. There are a lot of other varied and cheaper eating options within walking distance of the hotel.

We booked the hotel through Hotels.com and were satisfied with the rate and location and indicated we'd like early check-in. A few days prior to arriving in New York city we received a message from Hotels.com asking if we wanted to upgrade our room (with options ranging all the way to penthouse suites). The prices for upgrading were reasonable so we OK'd the opportunity. However Hotels.com did indicate upgrades were not guaranteed. Anyway, the day came and we arrived at the hotel around 1pm. When we got there we indicated we had requested early check in and also about the upgrade. After several minutes we were told rooms were not available nor were any upgrades. To say the least, the offer should not have been made if there were 'No' upgrade available. We indicated our displeasure and the girl helping us said she'd take care of us, find a nice room and get us checked in as soon as possible. Over the next several hours we were told repeatedly that the room was not ready. Even though they called several times to housekeeping. Finally 4pm roled around and we were yet to get a room. At this point we were exhausted, frustrated and starting to get very irritated with unrealized promises. Keep in mind, that 4pm is check in time. At 5pm we finally got our room. We were told we'd be very happy and satisfied and that they did manage to upgrade us a little. We arrived to our room and were in uttter shock. The room was probably the smallest hotel room I've ever seen. Enough room for the bed and a standard bathroom...that's it. A tiny closet and not even any descent storage space other than two small night stands. Having waiting 4 hours plus for the room we immediately trekked downstairs. While waiting for the elevator, I happened to look at the evacuation plan, and I kid you not...we were given the smallest room on the floor and I'd venture to guess possibly the entire hotel. When we got to the front desk we told the desk person of the ordeal. Jennifer spent several minutes looking and then indicated she had one larger room available and that she'd personally walk us up there to view the room. We went up and the room was huge. Two beds, three night stands, a living room, huge closet and the bathroom was giant. The shower could fit up to 10 people comfortably...that's how big it was. We immediately we said we'd take it. Jennifer indicated it would be $60 a day more than what we had booked which kind of ticked us off as it was more than the 'upgrade' special we were offered earlier in the week (and that they didn't have any of). At this point we relented, just to move on with our vacation. We'd already lost a half day of enjoying the city dealing with this fiasco. Had it not been for Jennifer, our NY stay would have been ruined. The new room was great and it was a shame that they did not honor the upgrade, the early check in request, the normal check-in time and any offer for the inconvenience and still charged us for the upgrade (more than what was offered). My wife an I are convinced that they catered to repeat customers and put more effort into pleasing them, than new customers. Although the entire hotel was really nice with a nice restaurant and location, they staff definitely was not very helpful and we feel like the hotel should have bent over backward after all of that to make sure we were at least happy.","Lake Mary, Florida","ScottG_FL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lake Mary, Florida</strong>",66,3.0

Right across the street is Maison Kayser with authentic French cuisine where we had a street side amazing breakfast - I felt like I was in Paris again!

I would love to give it 5 stars due to its customer service alone, because they would deserve it, but I must ding it 2 stars due to a lack of cleanliness. Our room and bathroom was in dire need of a THOROUGH and DEEP cleaning. Our shower reflected the remnants of previous guests (hair on the marble floor, product on walls). There were also bugs nesting on the ceiling of our shower. The floor of the room needed to be vacuumed. And the one time I forgot to put my slippers on directly from the bed . . . my feet had dirt and a previously crushed spider stuck to the bottom of them. Still don't understand the use of flat sheets instead of fitted sheets on the mattress, but many hotels go that route these days. So disappointing because this hotel could really be special . . . but they need to train their household staff or alternatively, make them understand that a thoroughly clean room will garner NYLO the attention it should deserve.","Houston, Texas","Houstonian2018</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",0,3.0

The hote has rates that were significantly cheaper than any of the chain hotels in Midtown (and also wasn’t located in Midtown...) This place is also much better than the nearby Lucerne, in my opinion, for roughly the same price.Negatives: this hotel does have the dreaded “resort fee.” They do not allow you to check in before 4pm (even if the room is ready!) unless you pay $50/room. The drinks prices in the hotel bar are not listed on the menu and are VERY high. The rooms are small.Pros: the rooms are very comfortable and thought out despite the small size. I had no issues with space or anything. Slept like a baby in the bed. Shower didn’t suck like so many hotel showers often do. The lobby is beautiful and the bar is a great hangout spot. On Thursday night a jazz trio played for a couple hours. The staff is friendly and helpful. The location of this hotel is great (2 blocks to #1 train at 79th, or 5 blocks to 1/2/3 at 72nd).

We followed up shortly before the official 4pm check in and were informed that the room that we were assigned to was not ready but we could take another room - so we did. Our room did not have consistent hot water - nor did we have consistent warm water - so showering was quick. Our room was not serviced on the second say so we had to request service. Staff members were pleasant and cheerful but the front desk staff lacked follow through. I would not refer to this as a quiet hotel - the lobby bar was busy and boisterous with a large opening to the street-fun atmosphere but I would not describe it as quiet.

The front desk was very nice - we were also glad to be upgraded to a King room, which was very roomy and faced the interior of the hotel (less noise) (07 room). This is a boutique hotel and the rooms are not standard hotel furnishings -- kind of industrial styling. The bed was very comfy and quite high off the ground (just warning shorter folks). The bathroom, while not huge, was well laid out and we loved the walk in shower. Full size closet, etc., Like a lot of NY hotels, they charge an additional ""amenities fee"" -- they told us that up front so we didn't feel misled. The bar is nice and the terrace room with couches, games was lovely (altho it seems to be used for private events sometimes, it was open most of the time we were there). The wifi was excellent. We would most definitely stay there again. There is room for some small improvements -- frankly, our interaction with the reservation number was poor -- the agent was really, really slow, could not ever get our names/info right, and I'd really recommend booking on the web. While the housecleaning was good, it did not clean the rooms until pretty late (in one case after 330) and we gave up asking and just got towels. Later that evening, I got a pop-up on my computer asking about the service -- i answered honestly about the cleaning snafu and got an immediate phone call from the front desk. They asked when they could come to clean the room the next day - and it was done a little earlier that day. After we left, I used the chat to request a soft copy of my bill. Never got it.

All of the hotel staff are amazing and helpful. You are greeted by friendly doormen that make a wonderful first impression upon your arrival. Orlando, Alberto and Lenny are our favourite doorman, the best in the city! They are so professional and always greet you with a smile, they offer assistance and information to make your stay more enjoyable. Front desk staff, such as Vivic, Carlos, Jennifer, Ramona, Jessie, Eloy and Tasha go out of their way to accommodate their guests needs. Maggie the front desk supervisor, and the behind the scenes staff like Johanna and Rose are wonderful too. We've stayed at this hotel many, many times and everyone is treated like a special guest and made to feel right at home at the NYLO. The bellmen, Eduardo, George, Bobby and Danny are always available to assist with luggage and any other requests you might have. The NYLO has a sophisticated and comfy lobby and bar, an overhead garage-like door opens up to the street and lets the sights and sounds of the city in, a great vibe! The bartenders Ben, Chris and Henry treat their guests right, they add an element of fun when visiting the NYLO lobby bar. I have to give a shout-out to Meria in housekeeping who always takes good care of me and does an amazing job on my room. I really can't say enough about the NYLO, you won't be disappointed!

I immediately fell in love with this hotel. I grew in New York City and don’t really like staying in hotels when I’m here, but NYLO is not just any hotel: it has a classy yet low-key feel. I feel entirely at home here and enjoy their TLC. I would in particular like to give kudos to the amazing staff, which always treats you not only with professionalism, but with kindness and care. They listen. The front desk is run by many wonderful human beings. Last time I stayed at NYLO NYC my father had just died. After taking care of him for five years, I was a little worse for wear. Because I was stressed before booking my trip to NYC, I had two different reservations at NYLO NYC, for two different rooms. The hotel was jam-packed, but I called ahead to see if maybe they could manage to keep me in the same room for my entire stay. Ramona, one of the stars of the front desk, told me that it would be difficult, but lo and behold, when I arrived at NYLO from Europe that evening, Ramona had pulled out all the stops, juggled things around and managed to accommodate me. I couldn’t have been more grateful. She truly outdid herself, and to boot, she is very sweet. During this stay, my daughter joined me at NYLO for the night of her 21st birthday. I had mentioned this to Jessie at the front desk, and when we arrived in my room late that afternoon, there was a bottle of wine, two glasses and wonderful artisanal chocolates waiting to greet us – with a lovely note from Jessie and her colleagues. I should add that Jessie has assisted me with various issues over the years, not the least keeping me in the same room when I’ve extended my stays. She is a true gem, and very warm. Other wonderful, supremely helpful and friendly members of the front desk are Carlos, Amado and Eloy. They have never greeted me with anything but a smile and a can-do attitude. I would also like to give a shout out to Rosa Carr in reservations, another genuinely helpful staff member who has solved many reservation snafus for me, and to the marvellous Mira, the finest hotel housekeeper I have ever met. Diligent and warm. Now to the rooms… Of course I love the rooms at NYLO NYC or I would not stay here, fabulous staff notwithstanding. I especially enjoy of the rooms facing Broadway, but all the rooms I have stayed in have been light and airy, with a fresh, modern, playful design – and they are always clean. I like their unencumbered feeling. And the beds are heaven! I sleep like a baby here. And I am thrilled that the bathrooms include hand-held shower heads, which is often not the case in NYC. Also, whenever I need a fridge – which is always – I ask for one, and the front desk sends it up right away. I am also perpetually asking for extra hangers, which are always promptly supplied. Not to be forgotten, the lobby is very nice and having a bar on site is convenient. Don’t forget to have a drink on the terrace bar on the 16th floor! I have moved back to NYC now and will likely not be staying at NYLO as often as before, but I know I will book a room once in a while when I need an especially restful staycation. And of course I recommend NYLO NYC to everyone visiting NYC! Thank you to all at NYLO NYC for always making me feel comfortable and welcome. Pina (Helena) Nilson",,Pinans1819,0,5.0

My friend and I were looking for a higher end boutique hotel on the Upper West or Upper East, to enjoy a few days in Manhattan for a girls' trip. This hotel had high ratings and the location is good, so we thought we'd give it a go. At the check-in desk, I was simply handed my key by the front desk attendant. There was no description of any amenities (wifi, fitness center, etc), and no offer to provide a map of the area or suggest a dinner destination. It felt strange to just be handed a key and pointed to the elevators, at a hotel of this type. The first thing I noticed when I entered the standard king-size room was how tiny it was. There's very little room between the bed and the walls, and no armchair or sitting area at all (other than a small desk). I was also very disappointed by the windows - two small windows looked out directly to a plain grey wall about 5-10 feet away. Absolutely nothing else visible, and almost no natural light could make its way into the room. What's more, the windows were covered in pigeon crap. Needless to say, we kept our curtains drawn for the duration of our stay. Another thing I have to mention is the housekeeping staff - first, I left a generous tip the first day of our stay, next to a note politely requesting a few more towels be left in the room (there were two of us staying, and only two body towels were provided when we arrived in the room). Unfortunately, when I came back to the room later that day, there was only one additional towel left for us. I just found that frustrating when I had tipped and requested a FEW more. The second problem we had with housekeeping was their habit of banging on our door BEFORE 9AM to clean the room. I don't know why that would be the standard time to begin room cleaning, it seems earlier than you could expect people to be gone for the day. Should I have to hang the ""do not disturb"" sign on my door in order to not be violently woken up at 8:30 a.m.? Finally, I have to mention a cleanliness/health concern - on the last day of our visit I noticed there were gross little bugs in multiple places in the bathroom. I've included photos. This is obviously a problem that NYLO should work to remedy. All told, our room was $300+ with fees per night, and I expect more for that price than what we got.

The reception said that there was no guarantee as to the availability of the room with a view (incredible). I went with my fiancé and upon check in the reception didn’t ask for her information. After 4 days going back and forth in the hotel, my fiancé arrived at the hotel after a long business day and asked for a new access key and the reception denied saying that I would have to authorize (I don’t recall a hotel that don’t keep record of their guests appropriately). She was only given news keys after crying and providing my personal information (nice way to end a business day). The funny thing is that moments ago the reception handed her a package without asking for her ID. As it was a business trip, I booked one extra night so we could arrive early in the morning in the hotel directly from the airport without having to ask for an early check in and wait for a room, even though we had to wait for my room to be cleaned. The receptionist reacted arrogantly when I asked how long it would take. The rooms - even those of a superior level like mine - don’t have mini bar (4 stars hotel?).

Fluffy bathrobes, piles of lovely clean towels, a mini-bar or fridge, space for an armchair and a decent-sized desk--all these do wonders for one's overall perception of the hotel. None of these were available to us; we had to ask for extra towels, there were no bathrobes, no fridge, a tiny desk with an office chair and so little space that we were constatntly treading on each other's toes. There was a Keurig coffee machine--with CARDBOARD CUPS!!!!! And plastic disposable beakers in the bathroom. We thought about moving elsewhere but could not face the hassle, especially as it was graduation time and many of the hotels were full. To cap it all, the hotel only has three lifts to serve something in excess of 100 rooms; this in itself is way below what is needed, but during our ten-day stay there were, I think, only about three or four days when all three lifts were working. For a good proportion of the time only one lift was working; we were on the 15th floor and spent many minutes each day either waiting for the lift, or ascending/descending in it at excruciatingly slow speed as we had to stop at every floor to let people in or out. Also, if you are not going to provide a fridge you could at least provide a LARGE ice-bucket and have ice machines on every floor. There appeared to be only one machine, on the 12th floor, and the ice bucket in our room was only big enough to hold one drinks can at a time.","London, England, United Kingdom","Amanda J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, England, United Kingdom</strong>",9,3.0

I called the hotel and tried to arrange for a refund or credit. I was told that no refund was possible and I could have a credit only if I rebooked the room immediately or within the next 2 hours. Lovely customer service (sarcasm here). I understand their policies, but good service means attempting to understand how to serve a good customer or potential new customer.

Overall I’m glad I chose NYLO- the UWS location was great, very close to 79th and 72nd stations on the 123 subway lines. I stayed at a Deluxe King corner room, which had a good view and the room size was plenty for one person. The decor was modern and the king size bed was extra comfy. The room had complementary water and coffee/tea machine which was nice, but I wish they also had a refrigerator. The bathroom was also nice and spacious with a large window. One minor thing was that there was a wet tissue placed on the corner of the window, and it was there until I left. I don’t know why housekeeping hadn’t cleaned that up- maybe there was a leak?One thing that was inconvenient— 4pm check-in time is very late. Regardless of my early check-in request by e-mail and room availability, they told me I had to pay an extra $40. They were able to look after my bags while I was out so it was fine in the end, but it would have been nice to drop off my bags in the room and relax a bit after a 12 hour flight. If I’m already paying over $200 per night, I don’t think they should charge me extra to accommodate for early check-in, especially if a room is ready.With everything considered though, the front desk staff were pleasant and they were helpful when I had a package delivery.

Everyone was helpful but they weren’t really forthcoming with offering help or warm for that matter. It also took a long time to check our bags (both my boyfriend and I had time to use the restroom...and then some before someone came) and was annoying especially since we were short on time. We weren’t given instructions on amenities, WiFi, or various food options offered at the hotel. The room itself was amazing. We got the loft with terrace. The hotel staff kept saying “it has the best view” and I didn’t understand what they meant until I saw it. We were on the corner and our terrace offered a 270 degree view of the city. The rooms had multiple tall windows which allowed for tons sunlight to enter. The room had pretty cool furnishings and light fixtures. The room was also huge and had a couch with a pull out bed.

Not enough tea or coffee for two, bottled water (which is part of the room price) not replenished some days, and cleaning cart left in the hall at all times.

The hotel is OK, rooms are tiny, very very small even to manhattan standards, but the hotel was not bad, until I checked out.I was charged $31 per night for the 'urban fee', something apparently was not included in the hotel rate. They said I signed for this when I checked in, but when they made me sign that form they did not say that was for a fee, they said it was just a signature they needed. Actually, the guy said 'no need to fill the whole form, we just need your signature'.Apparently you pay $31 per day for internet, access to the fitness center and a welcome drink. But you cannot opt out of this, there is no way to say 'don't give me internet, but save me the $31'.The reason they do this, is because they can advertise a lower rate, win over competitors in search engines, and then charge an additional $31 per night (20% of their rate) at checkout. So, my advice, do not compare this hotel to other hotels of $150, because the nightly rate is well above $180, and if you take that into account, there are better options. Besides this, the sole fact that they do this is something not nice at all. I prefer to be treated well as a customer, and not to be scammed like this.Having said all this, the rooms are OK and clean, the service is good, and the bars and restaurants at the hotel are also good.

Great location, nice room, wonderful price with upgrade under $200 – but the hidden $30 resort fee is annoying if you unaware of it. I had two rooms – the one with an HVAC system that cold wake the dead and the one they found for me the next night without a fuss or muss. Bed was great, room recently renovated, bathroom large by NYC standards, and the WiFi was, without exaggeration, the best we ever had in a hotel. The little bar was reasonable, the restaurant next door, Serafina Upper West Side, was overpriced for lunch and terrific for breakfast. Cabs were outside, when not an Uber took three minutes, a great location. Within a five minute walk are dozens of pubs, bars and restaurants, an express subway stop, yet the neighborhood is far less dense than midtown. Bottom line: my wife had stayed there on business, we were there for family, it is now our go-to hotel in NYC. Consider paying for an upgrade if you plan to spend any time in your room, when I stay there for work I enjoy the extr6a space and desk.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Michael S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",214,5.0

The hotel is within a 2 block walk from the 7th Ave line #1 train 79th St station. The entrance was located on 77th street between Broadway & Columbus Ave. The lobby contained a small bar and sitting lounge area. Across from that is the check-in desk and a small area where you could sit & plug-in your laptop or devices. The hotel has a hipster vibe to it and the overall decor tends to drift towards a minimalist modern design (clean lines, dark neutral colors). The hotel itself is pretty large (former early & mid 20th century office or residential building), and the layout of the halls and rooms was quite unusual. Lots of turns, nooks and blind corners. The staff was pleasant, and the front desk concierge was extremely friendly and helpful. A voucher is presented for the guest to receive a complimentary glass of sparkling wine or spritzer upon checking in. A nice touch.The room selection varies and the room I was in was probably one of the smaller ones available. My particular room (#1022), was an interior room with a small single window overlooking an alleyway with a clear view of the other rooms across and on either side of mine. Had to keep the blind drawn as anyone could get a clear view of you inside your your room. There was a full length curtain behind the bed's headboard which was used to conceal a bare wall. Room Amenities included:- A single cup Keurig unit, with a small selection of coffee & tea K-cups. - An Ironing board & Iron- An older generation iPod/iPhone compatible clock radio- Work Desk with chair & lamps containing built-in AC power plugs.- Room Safe- Complimentary Magazines- A Large wall mounted Flat Screen TV (access for RCA connectors only. No HDMI.)- Small storage areas for personal items.- Ice bucket & tongs.- Small area for hanging clothing (shared with ironing supplies)Basic Bath Amenities:- Standard tub w/shower & fabric curtain.- Standard toilet- The usual assorted bath toiletries.Other Niceties- Free Guest WiFi in the common areas and guest rooms- Complimentary check-in drink- Across the street from a 24 hour CVS.- Nearby restaurants and stores.- Close to public transportation.Cons:- Some rooms face an alley way with a lack of privacy from other nearby rooms.- Ice and vending machines are not available on every floor. - Building floor plan is like a maze and halls are kinda dark w/muted colors.- Lack of accessible HDMI inputs for Chromecast or Fire Stick devices.Helpful Hints:- Do not get room #1122 under any circumstances unless you like noise. It is located directly beneath the vending machine room and Ice dispensing unit.- Ask for a room that is not facing the interior alleyway as they are usually small and lack natural lighting (must keep the blinds drawn for privacy at all times). Conclusion?Overall, not a bad place to lay your head. The facility were clean (as far as I could see), and well kept. There are enough amenities in the hotel and nearby to make your stay comfortable and the location is great for getting around town. The staff is friendly and helpful and they do their best to make your stay pleasant. A star was taken off only due to the lack of privacy of the alley facing rooms, navigating the odd layout of the hallways and floors and the fact that you have to go to different floors to get ice.","Bridgeport, CT","Lockjawal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bridgeport, CT</strong>",13,4.0

There’s a $31/night hotel fee that is not generally included in the online price if you book with a third party. Sometimes it’s included and sometimes it isn’t. It’s never 100% clear. This past trip, I booked through Hotel Tonight and my confirmation said the $31/night fee was included in the booking total. I called the hotel to confirm and was also told by phone that everything was included, yes, if I’d booked with Hotel Tonight. Then, at checkout, they presented me with the bill for the extra fee for my entire stay and insisted it wasn’t included in my original billing total that was already paid. I had to find the original confirmation from Hotel Tonight and they had to check with a manager, who then decided to not charge me, but they would not have honored that if I hadn’t found that email, and the whole thing leaves a bad taste. They should have clear set pricing no matter where you book. What they’re doing now is a bait and switch and you have to jump through extra hoops or be hit with a surprise charge later. It’s not good business practice and not fair to customers. I hope they change this, and until then I’ll default to staying in other places if I can.

The place is well kept and clean, but the rooms are not large, but adequate.

Pros:- Beautiful lobby- Affordable- King size bed was extremely comfortable- Located close to the red line subway- Walkable to Central ParkCons:- Lots of noise. You hear everyone slamming their doors at all hours of the night. We could hear the room two doors down from us being loud/ having a party during the night. Housekeeping arrives extremely early and are loud. At one point there was even a group sitting in the hallway being loud to which we had to call down to the front desk. This hotel does attract a lot of young “hipsters”. The lobby can also be pretty noisy itself, with people walking around, pacing, loudly on their cellphones. - No water pressure. The shower, while nice, had very low water pressure. Think of the Seinfeld episode. - Bathroom sink – it was either extremely hot or cold, no in-between. - No view – we had a view of apartment windows. - Fake décor – online it looks like you will be staying in a stylish room with exposed brick. The exposed brick is actually wallpaper. Yes, wallpaper of brick. - Hidden charges. Our reservation had an “urban fee” of $27/night to cover water in the room, Wifi, etc. When we checked out, the fee increased to $31/night for all four nights. The weird:- On our last night, we came back and the cleaning staff had emptied all of our garbage into my shopping bag and left it in the middle of the floor. Thankfully none of the items in my shopping bag were damaged, but this was unacceptable behavior. The hotel management sent up a bottle of wine as an apology and two complementary breakfasts for use at the adjacent restaurant. Unfortunately, the breakfast tickets were useless as they refuse to accept them after 11am and our check-out was 11am. The hotel management did not indicate the stipulations on the tickets, nor did it say anything on the ticket itself. The entire apology was null and void given the increase in the “urban fee” covered the bottle of wine they gave us, and the breakfast tickets didn’t work.

Half-way through my stay, the full NY style breakfast service was changed from a 7am start time to 8am. When I arrived for breakfast after this change, there was no explanation or apology offered, just coffee and a croissant. The bus boy delivered the message and said I can speak the manager - the young woman huddled in the corner of the bar with her coat on looking at her cell phone. She reluctantly came to the table and said she was notified that morning via a phone call about the change. All we were offered was coffee and 1 croissant each. After overhearing another customer order the yogurt option (full bowl of yogurt with granola and fresh cut strawberries & blueberries) I had them take back the measly croissant basket in exchange for the yogurt option. If there were other options than just the croissant basket, why didn't the manager offer them? One of the reasons I love this hotel is for the full breakfast option at 7am so I can be on my way to the metro by 8am. The very poor service at Serafina was extremely disappointing.

NYLO has superb staff in every way. Very cool laid back industrial decor, great sitting areas, nice bar. Rooms exceptionally clean, climate controlled by you the guest.

The hotel itself was ok. Rooms are very small and dark. When we booked we upgraded to a Superior room - not sure we got what we paid for. When I checked in I told them we were there to celebrate my husbands birthday. The gentleman said they'd be sending something special up. It never came and I did not expect/pay for anything but thought that odd. The real problem was the bartender at the lobby bar. She was a polish woman with blond hair. I only mention her being polish as she announced it to another patron and there was another blond woman who was very nice. On at least 3 occasions, my husband and I found her terribly rude!! On one instance the bar was very crowded and I sympathized with her as she was alone. She had a drink order from 4 girls who required id. Long story short she told us it would be 10 minutes to which we all said fine. Then a couple of guys asked for ""candy"" which she took care of immediately (although it took her 10 minutes) then she went back and stared at cash register as if she didn't know what she was doing. She then came back to our side of the bar and asked if everyone was waiting to order which we all replied yes. One woman said she was waiting to settle (she had just stepped up to bar) so she took care of her first. She then said again, it's going to be 10 minutes but by this time we were waiting nearly 20 and she hadn't even started the 4 drink order for the girls. After another 10-15 minutes of nothing, I walked away and did not bother ordering a drink. This was not one of her rude moments, maybe inconsiderate.","Milton, Massachusetts","pmaher10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milton, Massachusetts</strong>",18,3.0

An exceptionally comfortable bed in a very nicely sized room (811) and bathroom for New York standards.They have a very relaxed and fun bar in the middle of the lobby if you don't want to lock yourself in your room and are the kind of person that like talking to strangers in a hotel bar. The lobby is loud though.The restaurant attached to the hotel serves standard Italian/American food. Ok quality, but a real life saver if you don't want to venture out.The neighbourhood is very nice, and although you are in the Upper West side, getting to Midtown is not difficult and you tend to go against the flow of traffic if you're in town for business or a weekend.A few things can be improved though. The service is efficient, but really dry. Very few smiles, security/porter who stand like statues by the check in counter and the lifts (very unfriendly faces...); Reception staff's behaviour don't really match what I perceived the mood of the hotel to attempt to be... Young, modern, friendly. Maybe that's a New York thing, but I have a real problem with it.Also, I arrived early, around 11:30am, and although my room was available to check in, before the receptionist handed me the keys, she reminded me that she was doing me a favour because of the hotel's policy of charging for early check ins. I thought that was a very cheap shot and not a very savvy way of communicating the hotel policy. Don't like that at all...Another unappealing fact was that if the lift stops at the hotel service floor (2nd or 3rd floor, I don't remember), the doors open to the dirtiest floor you can imagine... dirty walls, old carpets, buckets on the floor... not the best impression.So some management action needed in terms of staff and fixing the look of that corridor/wall on the service floor if potential exposure to guests is unavoidable.Overall, I say anyone should consider this hotel.. You get a lot more for your money when compared to Midtown chain hotels where you are fighting for attention, service and comfort with the millions of other tourists that visit New York. You're close to the Park, a friendly residential neighbourhood, Museums and some decent neighbourhood shops. But keep you expectations balanced in terms of how much of a ""boutique"" feeling it really has... I felt anonymous as a guest, but sometimes, that's what you want...","London, United Kingdom","tonicocanto</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",13,3.0

We stayed 5 nights. My wife had e-mailed ahead to arrange for a bottle of Prosecco to be in the room for our arrival for a surprise. When we got to the room she was very disappointed that it had not been delivered as has been arranged and confirmed in an e-mail response. With the 'moment' passed we decided to ask what had happened the next day. The man on reception checked and the request was on the booking but had not been actioned. He said sorry in a perfunctory manner and asked if there was anything else he could help with; nothing was offered to make up for the mistake. Perfectly polite but the lack of attention to detail had spoilt a moment my wife had planned and this could not be fixed. It tinged our opinion of this hotel from the off and they couldn't recover.I also visited the bar once where the barman could not pour my beer of choice (too gassy and it kept over flowing) so poured me another beer that i hadn't requested and charged me for it. Nice enough beer but it should have been the one i ordered. Drank elsewhere on the other nights.The positives. Clean room, smart lobby, great location with excellent restaurants on Amsterdam a short walk away. The negatives. Noisy. Kept awake on our last night with a wedding party running between rooms and shouting. Not hotels fault but their walls are very thin and gave little noise reduction. Our Honeymoon had budget constraints but i wouldn't recommend this hotel for a special occasion. Its in a great location, is clean and functional.

I specifically booked a Superior King Room as I had two large suitcases with me. When I checked in, I was given a room, that matched the exact room pictured as a Standard King room on the NYLO website. I asked to switch rooms the next day, particularly as there was a loud rattling from the HVAC in my room which kept me up at night. I was moved next door to a MUCH smaller room with a much smaller bathroom (that had a better but still noisy AC as the system seems quite old). I inquired about the class of room and was told that both rooms were the same class and nothing else was available. Based on my experience and other reviews, I believe the hotel treats all its king bed rooms the same while charging more for 'superior' or 'deluxe' rooms. I wish they had been honest and just apologized and refunded me the difference. On a positive note, the hotel has a cool vibe and great location.

The rooms are clean, crisp and with enough amenities to provide a comfortable experience. The rates are competitive. There is plenty of room to relax in the lobby areas. The hotel is convenient to a number of Upper West Side attractions and restaurants. The service, however, leaves much to be desired - a lack of attention to detail and an annoying aloofness that I don’t find at other NYC hotels.I had scheduled a meeting with potential business collaborator - first meeting - and I checked on opportunities at NYLO because of a bum foot that limits my walking. I chose LOCL, the hotel bar, because it opens at 3.00p and it advertises an “all-day” menu for food. I met my guest and we sat down. We waited about five minutes before I went to up to the bar to ask if it was open. “Yup,” replied the bartender (without looking up from his tray of glasses). “Do you provide table service?” I asked. “Nope,” was the reply, again without looking at me. I asked for menus and rejoined my guest. When I went up to bar to order, the bartender (finally looking at me) said, “We don’t serve food until 5.00p.” I wanted to ask what “all day menu” means at NYLO, but I didn’t think it was worth the effort. My guest and I went to a nearby restaurant. When I checked out, I chose the email receipt option. As I waited for the car to the airport, I noticed that I had not yet received the receipt. The hotel had an incorrect email address. Hours later, at the airport, the receipt had not yet arrived. I called the desk. The associate, who had checked me out earlier in the day, told me that she’d resend it immediately. When I received the receipt, I noticed an odd charge. I called the hotel. Three times. I let the phone ring and ring, but no answer. It was around 10.00a so I imagined that the desk was swamped with guests checking out. A few moments later, I called again. The call was picked up quickly this time by the same associate who had helped me earlier. No hello. No greeting of any kind. The FIRST thing I heard was “Didn’t you GET the receipt?!?!?” I guess NYLO’s caller announce system works pretty well, right? I only wish the staff worked as well. There’s no reason for this kind of exasperated rudeness. Two relatively minor experiences, I know, but in a city full of hotels with competitive rates when ALL THAT THEY REALLY HAVE as a differentiator is GOOD SERVICE, it’s completely unacceptable to NOT have accurate information shared in your promotional materials and NOT have staff who provide relatively warm and professional service. If you have a thicker skin and more patience than I do, NYLO could be a good experience for you. Just be ready for haughty indifference from the staff. Maybe NYLO thinks that visitors to NYC find this to be part of the “New York experience.” That became passé in the 1990s.",Pittsburgh,"ontheroadtoomuch</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pittsburgh</strong>",66,3.0

When I visit NYC and don't rent an apartment, I want to stay in a hotel that is off the beaten tourist path, that makes me feel pampered and comfortable but also ""at home"" and really part of New York (as if I still lived here)! NYLO is ideal this way, located as it is on the residential Upper West Side and to boot perfectly perched between two marvelous parks: Central Park and glorious Riverside Park (my favorite NYC park where I love to go running in the morning)! Moreover, it's close to two subway stations at 79th and 72nd St (where you can catch the express train). It's easy to get anywhere in the city from here on foot or by public transportation. NYLO has a clean, fresh, uncluttered and modern design, extremely comfortable beds and numerous rooms with lots of light and great views of ""everyday"" Broadway with good stores (check out DSW on 79th St & B'way) and NYC residents going about their business, living their lives. NYLO's staff is fantastic, service-minded and friendly (but never intrusive). Jessie at the front desk is a veritable gem, warm and truly kind and will always do her utmost to accommodate you and make sure you feel cared for and happy. This holds true for the rest of the staff as well, from doormen to housekeeping (I want to especially mention Mira who leaves your room spotless and who is ever sweet and personable). I get a nice feeling of privacy at NYLO, too, which means a lot to me and adds to its comfortable, homey feel. The bar and lounge are very nice and homey, as well.

Still love the Upper West Side location--close to Central Park, subway, restaurants, and nice neighbourhood feel in contrast to Midtown hotels. Minimalist, modern room was clean and the bed was comfortable.My main complaint though is that I paid for a Superior King room that on the website looked clearly superior to the Standard King, but there really wasn't anything ""Superior"" about it. The website had pictures of large windows and nice light. This room had a tiny window, filthy at that, so there was absolutely no natural light in the room. Worse, though, was the customer service that I received when I inquired about my booking. Three separate front desk people, including the reservations manager, couldn't give me the same answer about the difference between a Standard room and a Superior room--one even said there's no such distinction--all the King's are Superior and the Queen's are Standard. Another suggested it had something to do with having a street view vs a brick wall view (but with the tiny, dirty window, I'd hardly have paid a dollar more for the street view). The main thing is that I felt like I was getting the run around--very deceptive feeling---enough to make me not even look at staying here again. Don't trust the descriptions and photos on the website. If you can afford their beautiful upper floor terrace rooms, they are lovely. Anything else, unless you can get a Standard room for a very good price (certainly not what I paid) and I'd shop around for better deals/places--that will certainly be my strategy next trip to NYC. Too bad because I really do love the location, and I tend to recommend this hotel to lots of friends (but not anymore). Also, I paid for the breakfast package--decent value for sure, but the food and service over my four days (at the attached Serafina Restaurant) was hit and miss.

The decor is modern and clean, the staff efficient and helpful, but perhaps feel that they need to uphold the New York tradition, which excludes warm and friendly. The location is the height of convenience for a visitor, being close to many destinations, including Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum and the American Natural History Museum. Shows and other mid-town attractions are also very accessible, but downtown less so. In the area around the hotel, you will find many markets, delis, restaurants and other servicdes, which is a good thing, since the hotel itself offers relatively little in that way. The cost is very manageable, especially for NYC, and everyone of the many to whom I've recommended the hotel have liked it very much.

The bathroom is a different matter. The stainless steel wash basin, which is reminiscent of a mortuary's sink, was not level, therefore didn't fully drain. There are four 4"" square shelves that can barely hold one person's cosmetics, let alone 2. The bed was soft, but comfortable.The staff were very helpful and attended to our needs quickly. If there was supposed to be a full time doorman, there was a definite problem as there was rarely someone attending the front entrance.

I chose NYLO which is a hotel I stayed in few times when it was called On The Avenue. It has had a remodel since rebranding itself and I noticed the lobby and bar area were pleasantly decorated. There was a lot of dark wood and heavy chairs and furnishing that gave the entrance area the feel of an eclectic, somewhat European living room. It was not busy at the hotel when I arrived and I walked right up to the front desk. The reception was chilly. I mentioned that I had not stayed at the hotel for a few years and complimented the remodel. The receptionist's curt response was that I had ""been away at least three years"" if I had not seen the remodeled lobby before that day. I then mentioned that I would take any upgrade available as I knew the hotel had nice rooms with balconies on the higher floors. As the On The Avenue, the hotel used to give complimentary upgrades if you tweeted about staying there, but, assuming the management had changed, i indicated that I was willing to pay for a room upgrade if available. ""Completely sold out"" was the reply, and nothing more. My room was booked by my company's service, so there was some sort of corporate discount applied that made it under $300 for the night. It was a standard king room on the second floor. The view was a brick wall and the HVAC workings of the hotel. While the size of the room was above average, it was clear this was a room used for last minute guests ( which I was not) and was only marginally remodeled. ( I am attaching a photo of how the ceiling looked above my door from the inside) I had breakfast at Serafina, the restaurant attached to NYLO, the next morning. It was pretty good and very much priced for NY tourists. Unless I have reason to be on the UWS again, I don't think a return to the NYLO is in the cards anytime soon. The front desk interaction was bland and perfunctory and clouded any positives of my time at NYLO.","Silver Spring, Maryland","Farmerica</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Silver Spring, Maryland</strong>",140,3.0

The rooms are large for NYC standards and modern. Two queen beds. Comfy mattresses. Bathroom isn’t huge but serviceable. We have friends and family on the UWS, which is why we wanted to stay in this area. It is definitely not your traditional tourist neighborhood like Times Square (we considered this a good thing). There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance (well, come on, it’s NYC...skip the attached restaurant, though. It’s an Italian chain and nothing to write home about), coffee, bars, etc. The hotel itself was great. Staff were pleasant. Rooms were clean. The only issue we had is that they were doing some very noisy maintainance/construction work in the hallway right outside our room. They didn’t start until late morning, but still... we were on vacation and it would have been nice if we’d been notified the night before that we shouldn’t plan to sleep in. It’s a shame, because it marred an otherwise very nice stay.So, if you plan to stay...make sure to ask if they are doing any work inside the hotel and to be put in a room farrrrr away from it.",New York,"natemalter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",17,4.0

Serafina's off the lobby is very good, and there is a terrific food market right across the street. Great location for getting to Central Park. Staff was fine, though not overly commendable.

The person at the desk, avoiding all eye contact, told me that they had given our room to someone else and that all they had was a room with 2 twin beds on a low floor. Why did they give the room I reserved to someone else??? They had my email address and phone number...couldn't they have confirmed that I would be there? I guess not. I told them that I was not willing to stay in a small room with 2 twin beds on a low floor..... unless they gave me a substantial discount. Suddenly, two people at the front desk went into action on their computers and bingo, they found a room with a large king bed, albeit on a low floor, that was supposedly an upgrade. Why in the world not offer an upgrade from the beginning? What a bad first impression. They don't seem to know a thing about creating good will. The room was pretty but barely above street level and noisy. When I called to reserve they had assured me that there was a magnifying mirror in the bathroom...there wasn't ..just the arm where the mirror had once been...there was nothing they could do about it they told me.So, we're off to a bad start....tried to downgrade the reserved room, no magnifying mirror but there were a few other things that made it an unpleasant stay overall. First of all, no one, not a single individual at the front desk ever smiled! It was like everyone was in his or her own world...whenever I walked up to the desk to ask a question I felt like I was bothering someone! The worst offender in the ""don't bother me"" category was the so-called concierge. She sat behind her computer screen, only looked up if you could get her attention, had never heard to major museums and galleries, knew nothing about fine dining and gave us wrong directions to a museum (I had to spell Whitney 3 times) which caused us lots of unnecessary walking. Come on now. This is supposed to be a boutique hotel...It has a concierge. A concierge should be in uniform, standing up, smiling, offering information and should look professional. This young woman was ill-informed, not in uniform and in need of ...sorry ...a serious manicure...Ugh!!!!The breakfast at the Serafina was ridiculous. No substitutions.

The room was wonderful, the desk crew was extremely helpful, as were the bell service and the men providing curbside assistance. However.... The two times that I needed help navigating within the city, I chose to seek out the services from the Concierge on two separate occasions and with different women. In order for me to speak to either women, I first had to get their attention. From what? Their cellphones. I stood by the concierge stand for 30 seconds and debated whether or not to interrupt them from whatever was keeping them from performing their jobs. I decided to risk it... big mistake. In both cases my ""excuse me, could you help me?"" was met with a look of disdain. I'm thinking they were not pleased to see me. My questions were legitimate. I was experiencing NYC for the first time. On my follow up trip? I'm torn. Do I look to Air B and B? VRBO? Try a different hotel? Customer service wasn't consistent across the board.

The rooms and bathroom were spotlessly clean, with a living room area, a separate bedroom area and bathroom area. Very comfortable, not traditional furniture - not tired, bed was very comfortable but yes a bit high. The lock room cabinets were a bit odd but colorful. Staff and the hotel really made the stay so special - it might of been slow in the city as it was the Labor Day weekend making the extra special upgrade possible, but the staff and hotel went far beyond that when they sent complimentary chocolates and a chilled bottle of very nice white wine to our room.

Coffee OK.At nearly USD500 per night (including taxes and gratuities), B&B for two people, I thought it was pricey for its four stars.","Bath, England","georgebE6763FE</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bath, England</strong>",1,3.0

We had a beautiful spacious room with lots of light coming through the windows. This trip we arrived late at night and were given a 2nd floor room with a tiny window looking on to a flat rooftop with a lot of garbage on it. The room was dark. The king bed took up the entire room, although the bathroom was very spacious. I questioned the ""urban fee"" charge of $31 per night when we arrived and we were told that this daily charge covers wifi, use of the gym, 2 bottles of water and 2 drinks at the bar on the first night. We complained about the fee and the man who checked us in told us that he had only been working there for 2 weeks and there was nothing to be done about the ""urban fee"" charge. As it turned out, we never used the gym or the drink tickets and the wifi in the room was painfully slow. On the positive side, the hotel is in a great neighborhood with great restaurants including the Red Farm next door. Its conveniently located to public transportation and also easy to walk to many places.When we checked out we saw that the hotel had deducted $4 a day from our ""urban fee"" but this did not change my opinion of our stay. We are not sure we will stay at NYLO again. We feel the hotel was not up front about the ""urban fee"". It was buried in the fine print of our reservation and we are still angry. We ended up paying an extra $27 per day for nothing. There are many nice hotels in NY to stay in.

The interior design is unique, but need more attention on hygiene. We found stains on the new towels. Also hot water didn't work properly. We were assigned to room that are quite afar, and both room were having this water issue. It took 10-15 mins literally for warm shower water to come after we turned the faucet all the way to the end. At first we thought maybe they didn't have hot water at all. It's such a big waste to let water run. We've mentioned this to front desk too, but they simply they can't help. The other thing is noise level on the 2nd floor is really high. In the morning when the city's sanitation truck passed by, it's impossible to ignore that noise. Not the kind of wake-up call/noise we expected. In the future, if you add an extra layer of soundproof to the lower-floor windows, that might help.

Once they have enticed you to their site they stick it to you hoping you will not notice the fee which is disclosed in small letters slipped into the overall charges. They call it a “mandatory urban fee.” It is not mandatory at all.

Perhaps you have a cell phone on which you make your phone calls and perhaps you do not use the other services offered. You should refuse to pay this fee!

We didn't go crazy, we each had a breakfast dish and a hot drink, just as we would have at Serafina, but we were made to feel like we were taking advantage by a member of Staff, called Stephanie I believe. She would not reimburse and said she needed to check with the member of staff who told us we could have breakfast elsewhere.This slightly put a dampener on the experience of our stay.

We told the front desk and the lady said it must be a mistake (which they see happen sometimes when bar customers put in the wrong room number) and would cancel the charge. We only paid for the room charge at checkout. Later we learned that the credit card has been charged the $26 and we, no longer in the US, wrote to NYLO reservation and were asked to write instead to the front desk manager, which we did and waited, reminded them twice and waited. It has been 12 days since we informed NYLO about the false charge (last email addressed to front desk, reservation and customer services) yet we have not received a response. In terms of the handling of this matter, I would give a 'terrible' rating but given the rest of the hotel being fine, I think a 'poor' rating is reasonable.

Three blocks from Central Park 77th Street entrance. Lots of food places and coffee shops in walking distance as well as 72nd Street subway station. Cute 16th floor deck. Major cons are the deck faces another building so kind of hard to get views of the city. The wi-fi was pretty weak both on phones and through connection. When booking if you get the standard Queen room it will be really small at the back of the hotel facing the other side of building since it's their no frills rate.

However, the service (they called it something like ""guest services"" was slow to answer. They do not have adequate staff at the reception/check-out, and particularly the bellman needs an associate. We left bags with them when we checked out, and it took awfully long for the bellman to be able to come and take them, and then a while when we wanted to retrieve them. Though the room is nice, the A/C is VERY noisy, and I found it disturbing. Also, our room was adjoining to the one next door, and there is only one door between them, and I could hear the next-door neighbor sneeze, and whatever else. They were not particularly loud people. It sounded very normal, but only one door does not block it out. I could also see the light coming from under the door at night. No excuse for that.

Adjacent is a hip-looking bar with garage style doors that open to the street. I can never give 5 stars to a hotel without room service, but there was a coffee maker in the room and the adjacent restaurant serves a perfectly nice breakfast. The rooms were small but efficient with some clever features -- eg, the bed that was high enough to slip roller bags underneath and out of the way. There was a real closet (not just an open hanging area). The bathroom sink was perhaps too industrial (all metal, looked a bit like prison surplus) but ok space around it and the bathroom was decently sized. A downside to the room was the absence of drawer space -- not an issue for an overnight but for us, staying 4 days, it was a bit of a nuisance. So why not 4 stars? I really wanted to. I liked it, it's an excellent value, and the location is terrific for the upper west side. But Towels! You need towels! and when you don't have them and you call for them, they need to be delivered. the first night our bellman noticed there was only one set so he offered to request a second. It arrived, but hours later. On day 3, we found no bath towels but nicely rolled fresh hand towels. I called guest services, was greeted with warm apologies and assurances, but no towels ever arrived ( I got some from a cart in the hall the next morning). Day 4, they left bath towels, but not wash clothes or hand towels. I didn't even bother to call. I am reluctant to mention this kind of thing, for fear that all that happens is that an overstressed maid gets yelled at. In fact, when a problem recurs that usually means someone up the line isn't paying attention. I should also note that bell service seems very short staffed. They were hard working and courteous, but hard to find. That can be an issue on arrival because you have to navigate two big steps in the entry from the street. Our bellman was great, but I noticed several guests standing around frustrated by the lack of assistance. Will I go back? Probably. The location and value are terrific and the space is good. And everyone is nice. But I may bring my own towel. ","columbus, ohio","ohiominstrel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>columbus, ohio</strong>",18,3.0

It was close to many of the places we wanted to visit during our stay and the metro station for convenient travel. It's also conveniently located across the street from a 24-hr CVS.The service was wonderful; they accommodated setting us up with adjacent rooms and manager Fannie and the hotel staff made my friend (the bride) feel so special by leaving her with a gift of wine and chocolate in the room. They also stored our luggage after checkout for a few hours, so we could continue to enjoy the city before departing home without toting suitcases. They also offered car service to the airport (although we didn't utilize this option).The rooms were a good size and we comfortably slept 4 to a room. The beds were soft and everything was very clean. Getting ready was a tad challenging, because there are no counters in the bathroom or convenient places to put hot curling irons/hair straighteners, but we made it work and it wasn't a huge deal. It was also surprisingly quiet. We stayed in rooms 216/217, which overlooked the CVS and a side street.

I was in an extremely good mood considering I had been on the road since 3 am (with no sleep the night before) and my 1.5 hour flight from Charlotte, NC took almost 5 hrs to reach LaGuardia (bad weather). The whole situation occurred due to a botched booking by Expedia. The room was booked using Expedia points, yet when I went to the counter to check in, the front desk clerk handed me an authorization to sign for over $500.00. I told her there had been a mistake and the room should have already been paid for. I did not sign the paper to authorize the transaction and told her not to check me in until I cleared the issue up with Expedia. Fast-forward 2 full hours and I am still sitting in the lobby with my pregnant wife who is in tears at this point from an extreme headache brought on by the atrocious ""fragrance"" that is being pumped into the lobby. During my 2 hour phone marathon with Expedia, no one from the property lifted a finger to assist or even asked us if we needed anything. At this point, my wife informs me that NYLO has charged her debit card over $600.00 for the room after I told them NOT to check us in. I went back to the desk to request a reversal of that transaction when I was greeted by a male attendant to insinuated that this was somehow MY fault. At this point I had enough of the rude conduct of the lobby staff, gave up and booked a room across the street at Hotel Belleclaire just to get my miserable wife and I out of the lobby. After 4 days of attempting to get Expedia to cancel the reservation and refund the money, I was informed that the hotel staff would not authorize a refund because the reservation was cancelled within 24 hours of check-in. I didn't even book the room an entire 24 hours in advance and attempted to get NYLO to cancel the reservation so I could re-book a room using my points through Expedia. The front desk staff advised they were completely booked and had no other rooms. For some reason, I could not get them to understand that they did indeed have an available room for me to book if they would simply cancel my existing reservation and allow me to re-book. It was like talking to a brick wall....a brick wall with an attitude problem. I have traveled to 28 US states and 12 South American countries in the past 2 years and THIS is the worst travel experience I have had.

The hotel is in a quiet location on the Upper West Side at the corner of 76th and Broadway just a couple blocks away from Central Park. Love this neighborhood! Just a block away from the subway and two blocks from Zabar's if that kind of thing is important to you. :) It is to us!We loved the staff here...everyone is helpful and wants you to enjoy your time in NYC. Free drinks upon arrival that you can enjoy in the ground floor bar or up on the 16th floor terrace - we sat out there quite a bit in the evening and enjoyed the views over to the park and the surrounding buildings. The room was extremely clean and nicely decorated. Quite small but hey, it's New York! One nice feature was that the bed was lifted off the floor far enough so that our suitcases could easily be stored underneath...if that hadn't been the case it would have been very cluttered and crowded in the room with absolutely nowhere to stow them. Nice little closet, well appointed bathroom. Great amenities - but no in-room fridge which we were a bit bummed about. I don't know where they would put it though! I will say that the bed is probably THE most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in...even better than the Westin Heavenly Bed, which I adore! We really thought that the quality of this hotel was right in line with the price...we didn't feel overcharged like we sometimes do in the city. Fair price and good value.The one thing I will say is to skip the restaurant downstairs, Serafina. It's a chain all over the city and we found the service to be quite bad, even when we just wanted a quick breakfast. Food was OK but with all the choices in the area you can do MUCH better.We'll definitely stay here next time we're in New York.","Long Beach, California","Anitathetraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Beach, California</strong>",20,5.0

It would be our third stay at this hotel. We received an email that day confirming our reservation. On 7/21/17, we received an email from Rosa Carr (reservations at NYLO) confirming details of our stay--including connecting rooms.On 7/23/17, we arrived at the NYLO to check-in and were told by the clerk that the people staying in the connecting rooms did not leave and had extended their stay. Therefore, we were told, we had been assigned non-adjoining rooms on the same floor. We expressed our disappointment, but we were not given an option. We were promised that the next morning we would be moved from our first rooms into connecting rooms as we had reserved. We were told to repack our suitcases and leave them in the rooms. The luggage would be moved to our connecting rooms the following day. I could not understand how another guest breaking their contract with NYLO would then entitle NYLO to break their contract with us.The next morning, before departing the hotel, we inquired at the desk to ensure a work order had been placed to move us to connecting rooms. We were assured this was the case.That evening we returned to the hotel, stopped at the desk, and were given our new room assignments and keys. It was confirmed we had connecting rooms.Upon entering our rooms, it was obvious they did not connect. Needless to say, we were upset. We returned to the desk with our concerns. The clerk said that we should repack our suitcases the following morning and leave them in the current rooms. We would be moved to connecting rooms the next day. We asked to speak with the manager.Manager, Stephanie, told us connecting rooms were not available, but they would be the following day. She said it was not her fault as she was not on duty when the errors were made. She expressed apologies and offer a night’s free lodging as compensation. We accepted.On the third night of our stay, we finally had connecting rooms.On 7/27, our receipt revealed a total compensation of 15%--15% of the bill for four nights lodging. The stress and frustration of this incident robbed us of much of our enjoyment in our entire NY stay. For two nights, it deprived us of sharing family companionship as we had planned for a year.

So I didn't receive the breakfast I was told I'd receive. They didn't even have a plan B to offer me a cold breakfast. I had to ask them for a crossiant. I was supposedly credited $37.00 for that issue but when I checked my card statement, it was only $10. Then lets fast forward to the bar where I tried to use my drink tickets.

The NYLO has that quintessential boutique feel which can be a nice touch when heading to the busy Big Apple. It provides a unique chic feel without trying to hard, its authenticity gives it a very comfortable feel…like your in on the joke not standing on the sidelines. Check in was excellent and efficient, we were a bit early they stowed our bags and called us to let us know when our room was ready. A very nice touch was upgrading our room to a King size bed, a bonus for me because I am on the tall side. The room was fantastic, it felt spacious which is a rarity in New York. Great bed, comfy cozy, you sink right in but feel supported at the same time. Shower and bath room were great, excellent water pressure and nice selection of soaps and shampoos. Upon check-in we received a complimentary drink which we took advantage of before heading out on the town…excellent bar in the hotel with nice vibe..again a coolness without an air of superiority. Attached was Serafina restaurant (chain of Italian joint which can be hit and miss) but this was an excellent meal at a good price…we grabbed some salads but pizzas did look good and they use a wood burning oven. Location is a bonus also with the NYLO close to Red Line which you can jump on at 79th or 72nd. A little tip my wife and I like to grab breakfast at Bagel Co at 79th and Amsterdam…fantastic bagels with a great selection of spreads…and a fine cup of coffee…you know the place is great because it is frequented by the locals.

Since I was there for work, I didn't have time for that kind of disruption. Then he peered at the computer and saw that the room was being paid for by a nearby University. He confirmed that this was the case and then switched me to a suite with a balcony and a comfortable bedroom with two windows and a small sitting room. Much more than I needed but I appreciated the upgrade. The room was comfortable -- the furnishings modern and tasteful yet the overall industrial look (bare floors, no carpet) was a tad spartan.

Finding a hotel that was CLEAN and BUDGET FRIENDLY were the MAIN important points for me! PROS:Location! - If you like being on the ""quieter"" side of NYC, THIS is your place! - close to Central Park (10 minute walk) - close and SAFE walk to Shake Shack (sorry had to add this in there, we would walk over at 11pm-12am without any worries!)- more residential in comparison to other hotels- Friendly, safe, environment Environment- The minute you walk in, the hotel SMELLS AMAZING- You are greeted by amazing staff members and gear you to the right direction- This has a lounge feel to it (beautiful, rustic bar, and comforting relaxing space - THIS IS BETTER FOR MORE MATURE GUESTS - children may not like the look AS much) - Well-lite rooms and hallways (VERY well lit!) - THE BED IS AMAZING (very comfortable!!!)Cleanliness- I love how they have wood floors and the bed is elevated - Very clean countertops, washroom and overall surrounding Staff- The staff is very friendly and accommodating! - Do not hesitate to contact them, our window did not close properly and they sent their 'engineer' right away - very friendly!CONS:Building Structure- We were lucky to be situated at the end of the hotel (corner room) - but that doesn't mean we were removed from any loud noises! There was construction right across from us so if you woke up too early, it may be hard to fall back asleep - NOT THEIR FAULT. (Also - this is a given, but NYC is going to be loud with sirens and honks - after one night you'll be used to it!) Price - I personally found it worth it for the price; however, it wasn't the most cheapest of places either (3/5 on price scale)*** All in all, I WILL stay here again! I am looking forward to when they have sales and promotional offers going on to book my next visit (honestly, this is pricey so look out for those offers to make it worth while if you're on a budget, but still want that luxury!)

We had an emergency (my daughter's apartment flooded and I came to NY from another country to help her move out) and needed to change the reservation and the manager made it extremely difficult and would not understand even what we were asking for. The room was not made twice along the stay, the coffee machine broke and even if we brought it to the manager's attention it wasn't change and the maintenance person was sent to the my daughter's room. He was told it was the other room that had the problem but he never made it to that room or change/fix the coffee machine. The room locked us out twice because the latch behind the door locked itself and when going downstairs to explain it to the person in reception and get it fixed, he not only did not listen or seem to have the ability to understand what we were saying but sent the Security person up, even after me telling him the Security person would not be able to fix it. 30 minutes later the security person came and complained about the person in the front desk to me as well saying he did not explain the problem and that security was not able to fix it. Security person called the engineers. 15 minutes later they came and open the door, delaying my arrival to my commitment by 45 minutes. It also happened again in the same day and the handling of the situation was similar. Overall the staff is not professional, not attentive, they don't listen, they argue with the customer, do not follow up properly on issues and make the stay even worse.","New York City, New York","Marta S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",0,1.0

However, we also found things to be dirty, drippy, and damp. My husband said ""You know, this would be a nice hotel but the bathroom is just dirty enough that it's grossing me out."" I was thinking the same thing. We didn't find the staff unfriendly exactly, but they weren't exactly friendly either. We got our key, were pointed at the elevator and that was it. We felt like a commodity, which we are, but it's nicer when you feel like a guest. Oddly, our room was kitted out for one person. Four hangers, one bathrobe, one towel hook, one set of bath towels and a washcloth, one tea pod for the coffee maker. Just kind of strange. It was okay but we'll stay somewhere else next time, especially for the price. Also, it's loud - take earplugs if you're a light sleeper.

I personally don't like to see staff playing on their mobile phones while customers wait to be served. Would have spent alot more time/money in the bar if this hadn't been the case.

The hotel was close to the subway line that takes you directly to the college or Times Square or completely south to Battery Park (Ellis Island, Wall Street, etc.) I was already comfortable with the city, so I didn't need a great deal of assistance from the desk, but they did answer questions when I asked. I agree that they are not a ""warm"" atmosphere and do not provide information unless you know what to ask. (nothing in the rooms, nothing posted and a stand-offish desk). I had a simple, non-view room, but it was sizable, clean, modern and comfortable. (Laminate floors, stainless sinks, simple lines...) Housekeeping was a bit unpredictable, I didn't have the same towel configuration from day to day and had to ask for towels more than once, but it wasn't a huge deal. Great food is right out the door (two great restaurants or an amazing market across the street) and you really cannot beat the location if you don't want to be in Times Square chaos. Be prepared for your bill--sales tax, city tax, occupancy tax, Javits Tax, Urban fee and urban fee sales tax, urban fee city tax, all listed on top of the actual room fee. Each fee was listed for each night--it's New York, but WOW--straight forward pricing is a better idea in my opinion. Overall, this was a very budget friendly hotel for New York, and I would certainly choose it again.","Ohio, United States","sarabL6471GI</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ohio, United States</strong>",1,4.0

We felt like we were walking into a dark restaurant instead of a hotel. After making our way to the concierge, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist. She quickly got us settled and we were given our room key. We stayed in room 1403. Our room ""looked"" clean but upon further inspection, we noticed the Floor was dirty- found a random pen in the corner of the room, a piece of cereal blatantly in the middle of the room, and a huge hair ball in the bathroom! We were shocked at how the maid could have walked out leaving the floor so gross. Thankfully the rest of the room was okay- just a side note, there is no mini fridge! We weren't expecting this, and were a little disappointed. Also, don't expect a mini bar or room service. Bathroom was small but water pressure was good in the shower. Hairdryer did not work. Bed was comfortable and black out curtains were great. We tried to call Serafina for breakfast in the morning - after calling 3 times and having no one answer, we decided to stop trying and eat somewhere else. Pros: -Nice sized Terrace (not private though)-Bed was very comfortable, black out curtains were great-Water pressure in shower was good-Location (good if you are going to be visiting Central Park, the Museum of natural history and a 30 min walk to the Met)Cons:-Extremely dirty floor-Walls were very thin! Heard neighbors talking constantly next door-No Room Service-No Mini Bar-No Fridge-Lacks personality and service (theres nothing in the room that give you information about the hotel or what services they offer)Overall basic hotel that desperately needs more personality and CLEANLINESS!

I was greeted by friendly door people on my way in and enjoyed the boutique vibe of the hotel (not your typical boring Marriott). The lady at the desk was friendly and made conversation with me about my job. I was immediately sent to my room even though I was early for check-in. This was great. The hotel room itself was average. It was clean but didn't have any extras. There was no climate control in my room that I could see, the first day I was freezing and when the weather got warmer it was really muggy in the room and the windows don't open. The sink had no counter space so my things were always falling off and it was a shower with no bath tub (which I didn't mind very much). The view from the 7th floor was pretty nice but people apparently like to slam doors on their way in/out of their rooms after 11pm and I could clearly hear this. They had live music in the lobby one night that I noticed and it was very enjoyable, except the bar service was very poor and slow. The free drink I was given upon check-in was limited to sangria and some other choice I didn't like. The sangria was not good. Upon leaving, I asked to have my bill emailed to me and I never received it (unsure why). I tried calling to get it emailed and no one answered. I didn't use room service at all while I was there so can't comment on that. The location is great of course. Overall, my stay was ok because work was paying for it, but if I had paid my own money I wouldn't have been happy with the value for $400/night (it would be of more value to find an airbnb in the area).","Ottawa, Canada","sugarwaffle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",6,3.0

I was hoping for something a little better than basic, and was disappointed when we arrived. The room did have a balcony with a view, which was great, but it was small and no frills, with blackened grout in the shower and a single robe hanging in the closet, when the booking was clearly for two people. But I figured, oh well, we're here to see the city, not the room, and didn't say anything. However, early in the morning after our first night, we were awakened by a very loud noise that sounded like there was a helicopter landing nearby. The walls were shaking and the windows were rattling - there was definitely no more sleeping. I called down to the front desk, and they said they would send someone up. No one came. So we got dressed and headed downstairs to find some breakfast. On our way out, we asked again. They said they would send someone up, so we went out to get something to eat. When we came back, that's when things got a whole lot better. Turns out it was a broken fan, and not only did they switch us to a new room, they upgraded us pretty significantly - to a suite! It was huge, with a sitting area, balcony, and windows on three sides. And no broken fan noise or mold in the shower. We were so pleased! So the rest of our stay was amazing. Thank you so much for making it a great experience! Other things we loved: The location - we like staying in real neighbourhoods (hate anything near Times Square), and this definitely fit the bill. Absolutely loved the Upper West Side. RedFarm - awesome food, right in the same building. We had lunch there twice. Zabars just up the street. Three blocks from the park. Insanely comfortable bed, with bedding that was the perfect weight and texture. Great pillows, too (I'm picky). We received two complimentary sparkling wines, which we enjoyed in their beautiful lobby bar. Close to two subways stops, so getting around was easy.

This last stay however was very disappointing. The deluxe double room was very small with a very small bathroom. There was no chair and no desk. The closet had very limited hanging space although there was ample shelving. I called the front desk and complained but I was told that's what the room looks like and no accommodation for my disappointment whatsoever. When I checked in I reminded the front desk clerk that I requested a small refrigerator for my room. I was assured that ""oh yes, that's been taken care of. There was no refrigerator in the room although after I called down again one was sent up. I paid a flat rate through Expedia for my flight and the NYLO hotel. I thought it was a good deal but then I was charged an additional ""urban fee"" of $27 a night plus taxes. That turned into an additional $300 for a four night stay. What this urban fee was for I cannot say. I was given two coupons for 2 glasses of sparkling wine which I don't drink and so I couldn't use them. They didn't even give us a bottle of water in the room! I requested shower caps as there was none in the room. The maid said she would get it for me but never did. There is no night light in the bathroom and the clock in the bedroom is so bright that it lights up the whole room at night so I had to disconnect it. I paid more to stay at the NYLO this trip than I did the last two times and although I liked the king rooms I had in the past I thought this trip was a total rip off. It's a shame because it's a nice hotel otherwise. I love the lobby with the bar and music. They have a nice terrace on the 16th floor. The location is great. I come to NYC about six times a year and I will go back to staying at the Beacon, Milburn, or Lucerne before I will come back to NYLO.

We love it's location, vibe, staff and our rooms have been great. Unfortunately not this last time. In fact, if it weren't for our previous experience at the NYLO and the assistance we received from Jessie at the Front Desk, this review would have a much lower rating. This time, my wife found an online deal for a room and after booking it, she called the hotel to confirm and decided to upgraded to a king bed on a higher floor for an extra $25 per night (this was a 5 night stay). When we arrived, the room we were given was on a lower floor and so small that we couldn't both walk around the bed at the same time. The first woman we spoke to at the front desk was short and not friendly at all. Later, I went down and found Jessie at the desk. She was great. She promised that she would move us to a larger room the next day... which she did but at an additional $50 PER NIGHT. We asked for one of our favorite corner rooms... which weren't available but were given us a large room on the 77th street side of the building. Jessie was wonderful and very understanding and I know she believed she was helping save our trip (which she did) but, the suite (1209) ended up being very strange. Unlike the rest of the hotel, this room seemed like an afterthought. The large bathroom was only half-lighted, the towel racks were on the other side of the room from the tub/shower, there was a lot of unused space that could have made it a really wonderful room but, it wasn't utilized, the sink was very small with a faucet that hit you in the head if you bent over. The layout of the suite was backwards as well. The bed should have been where the sofa and desk were. That way, a room divider would have allowed for a bedroom and bathroom separated from the living room/office.So... yes, we will go back to the NYLO but, only if we're assured at a minimum, the class of room we always had before this unexpected experience.","Los Angeles, California","sadieson</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",0,4.0

The bed was extremely comfortable, and the room was pretty quiet as well. I had a great night's sleep. Obviously, so far this sounds like a five-star review, and it would be except for a couple minor items. First, although there were MANY outlets in the room, there weren't any near the bedside tables. This isn't a big issue, but it would be more helpful to have outlets close to the bed. The other problem was the in-room coffee. There was a Keurig machine and coffee pods in the room, but there were no sweetener packets or creamers. I'm assuming that this was a one-time oversight, but I can't be sure. Overall, I would definitely stay at NYLO again, and if you're looking for a fun, hip place to stay with comfortable, clean, affordable (albeit small) rooms -- this is the place for you!

Not only is this hotel very clean, new and reasonably-priced, but there are great little touches that I really enjoyed. Keurig coffee maker, very comfortable beds, built-in phone chargers in the side tables, a nice-quality magnifying mirror in the bathroom, plus a very good shower with great water pressure, very hot water and a telescoping shower head to accommodate all members of my family, from my husband who is tall to my son, who is seven years old. Very modern and chic interior. Rooms were a bit larger than I expected.I stayed in room 1203 for the first two nights, which faces the interior courtyard and was at the end of the hall. I'm a freak about noise and getting a good night's sleep, and this room was super quiet and relaxing. A great respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. Clean, comfortable and a touch larger than the hotels I'm used to staying in in NYC. I will stay here again the next time I come up for business and request this room.I then moved into a larger room on the 9th floor, room 904, when my husband and son arrived. This was a larger room that easily accommodated a rollaway bed for my son. It has two windows that face the side of the building, so there is no view, but it was VERY quiet. It also shares a wall with the storage room, which means no noisy neighbors. I really appreciated the cleanliness, large layout and QUIET of this room. My son goes to bed quite early, and he slept great at this hotel. The lobby, hotel bar and ""library"" are quite chic and provide a nice, relaxing place to catch a drink with a client or to unwind after a long day. The hotel gives you a drink coupon when you check in, which I thought was a nice ""extra.""We also enjoyed the downstairs restaurant, Serafina, which has pizza, pasta and also offers a continental breakfast. On one day or our stay, it was very cold, windy and rainy, so it was quite nice to enter this restaurant directly through the lobby of the hotel without going outside. I would say the staff at Serafina were a bit rude, but that's to be expected in NY. One night we ordered dinner from Serafina and it was very easy for my husband to just pop downstairs to the restaurant and pick up dinner.We also enjoyed Red Farm, which is next door, although you do have to exit the hotel to get there. Great amenities nearby. We cancelled a reservation at Hotel Wales to stay here with no regrets! ","Austin, Texas","April J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",4,5.0

The location is superb! You can walk to Central Park (3 blocks away), walk to many museums and, if you want to go somewhere else, the subway is just a few blocks away, Great choice of restaurants minutes away (by foot!) - Seraphina (enter from the hotel) was really REALLY great (I had seafood pasta), and I highly recommend the Red Farm right next door (top notch fresh dim sum and more - try the chicken Lolipops!). Sure, those are on the somewhat expensive side when you add a drink or two, but you can also go around the corner on Amsterdam Ave for the Amsterdam Ale House for a more local bar kind of place (they had wunderbar spinach and cheddar quesadillas - had 'em 2x), and then for a $8 breakfast, there's a diner (Viand Café) at Broadway and 75th (2 blocks away), as well as a Starbucks. There's a CVS right across the street from NYLO if you want a bag of chips or whatever. And the hotel bar is really homey and nice. If you go left on Broadway you gotta check out Citarella, and if you go right on Broadway, check out Zagar's. Why? For someone coming from Detroit (the city, not the burbs), it was like stepping into heaven: both have an incredible array of fish (fresh and smoked), cheese, sausage, bread etc (and kitchen gadgets on 2nd floor of Zagar's!). So, my only ""small thing"" complaint: I only wish that my room (which I though was quite large for NYC standards and very comfortable) had had a small refrigerator, so that I could have stocked up on some of those goodies to bring back to the D.

Should switch to ceramic cups.This is my second stay, each for a week at a time. Both times I have had to switch rooms after the first night due to noise outside. I have made more than fifty trips to NYC and stayed in hotels all over Manhattan. These are some of the noisiest rooms ever. Get a room facing the inside, don't take any room that faces the street, particularly on the lower six floors, you will be sorry at about 4 AM with construction, garbage trucks backing up, delivery trucks running their diesel engines etc. Our party of fifteen or so, all experienced NYC visitors, all complained about it and said they would never stay there again. Get an inside room or stay somewhere else. The gym is small if you like free weights. There are some but no room to use them to speak of. They need to expand the gym to twice the size to have room for yoga, stretching, lifting free weights etc.All the staff is exceedingly friendly and helpful.

The bathroom is smartly constructed and features a standing shower that even a tub-er would find soothing. The room is not overworked. That's important. Modern touches with attention to detail but not so many details that one feels overwhelmed. Everything is in it's right place in the room. When heading out to eat, a meeting, or to take in the city, it felt like I was leaving my apartment. In fact, I wish it was **big smile**. Having to check-out early in the morning sometimes is not a great experience - either takes too long or involves a chaffing interaction with the concierge. Not here.

I was slightly apprehensive based on some of the reviews I read but it was a great place to stay, especially for the price. It's a very cool boutique hotel and the staff was excellent. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. We only stayed one night and just booked a queen room due to lack of availability (because I waited until the last minute to book). The room was a decent size, had a comfy bed and overall was perfect for what we needed. For the price, you cannot beat it! The location was ideal. Very close to Central Park, Museum of Natural History and tons of cool shops, restaurants and bars.

I have some mixed views about the hotel. We booked a double Queen room for 5 nights but on arrival, was told that our room was not available for the first night- despite booking room many months before. We were allocated a upgraded room with a balcony- effectively a double room- with the offer of layaways for the our grown up sons. The room was very pleasant but was somewhat of a tight squeeze to accommodate all four of us. Disappointingly, one of the layaway mattresses was terribly stained- I don't know whether blood or other biological matter but a bit surprised that it was provided in such a state. In fairness, the Hotel offered us breakfast throughout our stay for the inconvenience- and that was appreciated. Theroom we eventually moved to next day was great! Breakfast was served in the Serafina restaurant- a lively venue in the evening but a little bit 'eclectic' on service in the mornings- forgetting to complete our breakfast order more than once- then insisting we needed to pay for 'extras' when we had already done so- and had left a good tip!

This was my first time using a boutique hotel. The service was perfect. From the moment I arrived I was greeted like a VIP starting at the front desk to getting settled in my room. I can't comment on the service provided for faulty plumbing or a burnt out light bulb because I never needed any of that. Everything worked perfectly when I arrived and I had no glitches to report going forward. The entire staff is wonderful. I truly felt like family during my stay. My room was great. It had every amenity but there was one thing that really stood out. The bed! The bed was so amazingly comfortable I barely got into it planning to watch TV but my hand never made it to the remote. I fell fast asleep. When I awoke, I had to decide whether to get up or spend the rest of the day in it. That was a hard decision. In my view, the bed is the most important aspect of any hotel. I have never had a decent night's sleep in a major hotel chain, many which cost more than the NYLO. If you wake up achy or sleepy, all the amenities and service in the world will not make your stay worthwhile. I've read other reviews where people said their room was too small. I did ask to check out some of the smaller rooms, and while they were a little small, they lacked for nothing. I asked for a larger room because my stay was originally planned for 8 days and I needed room for my clothes, shoes, etc. It was downright perfect in size.As a born and bred New Yorker with 35 years experience living in the city (now living in California) I can say with confidence that the NYLO is situated in what is probably the best spot in the entire city. It's on the upper west side, which is a residential area surrounded by the most iconic buildings and architectural wonders. It is perfectly situated for a short walk to central park, and if you stroll through the park to 5th Ave., you will find yourself at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Also within walking distance from the hotel are The Museum of Natural History, Lincoln Center, the famous Beacon Theater and some of the best shopping and restaurants. It’s also convenient to every major attraction in the city by subway. Across the street on Broadway is a grocery store with fruits, veggies, deli, bakery, appetizing section, international cheeses and your standard fresh, refrigerated and frozen food sections, and it's open 24/7. On the same street are two amazing bakeries, a coffee/bakery shop, and dry cleaners. Across on 77th and Broadway is a huge 24/7 CVS/Walgreen’s in case you forget something. As for the best feature of the hotel, that is a tie between the staff and the beds. I wasn't able to take anyone from the hotel home with me, altho I tried, but I found out that the beds are available for sale. We are in the process of purchasing one for our home. I suggest anyone looking to stay in the city check into the NYLO even for a night to see why everyone raves about the beds.I think it's worth mentioning that my stay at the NYLO was so wonderful, I changed my return flight and extended my stay for an extra 7 days. It just went by way too fast. Whether I was relaxing in the game room (replete with a lovely library and nightly chess wars and comfy chairs and couches), listening to the piano player or just talking to other guests in the bar area, it was an absolute joy to write home about. And just a friendly warning to the staff: I WILL BE BACK. This is now my new home away from home.",,Judy F,1,5.0

When we checked in, there was one guest at the counter, and a hotel agent popped out and checked us in. We needed a refrigerator in the room (no mini-bar) and a gentleman named Patrick (call out!) brought it up and was able to find a space for it in the very, very small room by rearranging the furniture. We made the reservation through the hotel web site, but had to call to confirm late arrival. The call center was useless, but eventually we got through to the hotel front desk and they were very accommodating.The room was small - the king sized bed just about filled the entire space. The bathroom failed the ""Throne Test"" -- can you open and close the door while sitting on the throne? In this case no. However, there was a good amount of shelf space in the bathroom and the shower was decent. Actually, there was a fair amount of storage space in the room, little cubbies and shelves in the closet. Lighting in the bathroom was decent; ambient lighting in the room not so, although there were good reading lights.We asked for a quiet room and they gave us one with a view of the court yard. It was very quiet. Bed was comfortable.The room rate of $134 quickly escalated to $188 on check out with tax and an annoying ""Urban Fee"". This entitled us to a drink in the bar; internet access; and other things that really should be included in the room rate. However, unlike our last experience on Price Line - Name your own price, the ""Urban Fee"" was prominent on their web cite. In that case, my bid was accepted by WestHouse and only after it was accepted did I learn that there were mandatory fees. So much for Name Your Own Price!Location - if you want to be on the upper West Side it's great -- not too bad for Broadway, very good for Lincoln Center, Central Park and American Museum of Natural History.

I got the AAA rate it's still not cheap with all the taxes etc. but unless you can afford the Mandarin at Columbus Circle at 900 a night this is your best option. It is in the perfect location - you can walk to Lincoln Center but if you insist on a cab it's only about $6. Subway also easy and fast. The lobby is swanky and trendy and I am sure a spot for locals . It was usually buzzing and has a really cool atmosphere. We were greeted immediately and our bags were whisked away - so quickly I asked if the guy actually worked there. I thought maybe someone just caught us at the door and took off with ll our stuff! All staff were cordial and classy and dressed well. Most polite and got us checked in as early as possible for our 8 night stay! The room was a double deluxe and faced 77th - I think all of those size rooms face out. Noise level was low minus occasional siren and some construction in the morning but that is normal for NYC. Mostly did not hear our neighbors. Everyone staying there was well mannered and polite as well. There are 2 floors with outside seating areas. Nice to go up at night. We did not have time to try the restaurant but i hear it is good. CVS on the corner and a market across the street. They brought us a small fridge for our extended stay. They also have access to car service if you want a black car to the airport. It's not cheap but is an option. Most times we were greeted by door men as we entered and exited. Even at the elevator they all said hello each time and it seems very secure there. No riff raff trickling in. Smells good in the lobby too! Our double deluxe room was fine - the beds are insanely comfortable. Maybe seem a slightly smaller than a regular queen but 2 people can fit. Closet has ample space and plenty of places to put clothes away. Is a bit narrow but you can't have it all! Room was bright and modern. The bathroom was also modern. ZERO complaints about cleanliness ! This hotel does not feel old or janky in anyway. It feels totally modern and redone. Upon leaving I had left an ipad in the room- we came back a few hours later to claim our bags from storage and the ipad had been left with security by the cleaning crew. PHEW!

Had stayed here about 14 years ago when it was then called ""On the Ave."" There are not a whole lot of choices if you need to stay on the Upper West Side, but this place is fantastically located, A few blocks from Central Park, a few blocks from the subway, and restaurants and shops everywhere. Even if you don't have any special reason to be on the Upper West Side, this is a pretty ideal location.Not sure sure what kind of vibe the hotel is trying to give off, but I guess it's striving for some kind of hipster/industrial thing. The rooms are somewhat smallish, but they were clean. The bathrooms were smallish too, but again clean. Housekeeping was fine. Not to be nitpicky, but our sheets did have a few small stains on them which was slightly icky, but otherwise the rooms were fine. A little noisy in the morning - and we were on a high floor - but it's NYC and so I can't blame the hotel for that.Now, it seems that the front desk staff have taken the hipster theme a bit too far because they were some of the rudest, unwelcoming, and least interested people I have encountered at a hotel in some time. I'm sorry I had to bother them with a minor detail such a ""checking in,"" or asking about how to get the valet parking, but I thought this was their job. Apparently I was either wrong, or I just wasn't getting whatever vibe they were trying to throw off, because I truly felt as if my mere presence - as a guest checking in - was an imposition to them. (Special shout out, however, to George the Bellman who - in contrast to the front desk staff - was especially helpful, attentive, informative, and pleasant). Overall, the stay was fine and the hotel is fine.

There is a restaurant at the hotel, Serafina. My daughter and friends ate there and said it was just okay. It was high for my budget so I was content walking across the street to the French café. They offered a pastry and coffee for $5.00. There was a silent (meaning you wear headphones) movie offered in the hotel's library during my stay. It was part of a series of films, so ask about that if you're interested. If I could change anything, it would be the noise factor. Broadway is a busy street and the hotel is next to a busy fire station. Our room faced Broadway (#628, near elevator) so we got the brunt of the car horns and sirens.

The hotel itself is chic, the lobby and bar are smart and the rooms are stylish/functional. However, when requesting your room, be warned that the rooms that overlook 77th are opposite a fully functioning 24/7 fire station. I was surprised how little soundproofing all the rooms had - I could hear the conversation in the next door room word for word. I'm not sure if this was because there was the option of adjoining rooms- again, make sure you stipulate you don't want this.It was a nice hotel but I wouldn't say it was 5 star. The location is close to Central Park but still quite far from midtown and the village.

Our suite was a bit spartan but did the job. Our main complaints were 1) a quirky shower that was impossible to find a ""just right"" temperature in, and 2) absolutely no information about costs for things like WiFi. There was also a very strong scent used that not all of us appreciated. But the upside was comfortable beds and the suite had a pull out couch. Note that the queen suite does not have a separate sleeping area, it's just got an added sitting area in a larger room. The price is pretty reasonable anyway. The location was great - our main goal was the natural history museum and it was an easy walk. Also very convenient to the subway to anywhere.

It's almost like walking into an Abercrombie store. - On the whole friendly and helpful staff- Good sized room for NYC and quirky/stylish decor and fittings & fixtures. - Large shower- Good location, about a block away from a subway station, which is served by 1 and 2 trains and can get you to most places directly or via a connecting train. - The room was clean and tidy and the cleaners did a good job at refreshing the room each day. - There is a CVS (a small supermarket to those who haven't heard of CVS) just across the street and a bigger market just across the avenue. CONS- Beware of the mandatory $25 a day facility fee, which is a hefty uplift if you're not expecting it. Other Tripadvisor reviewers have flagged the same issue and the hotel management have responded by stating they endeavour to make the fee clear in all booking channels. Unfortunately it wasn't clear to us at all which is extremely disappointing. As the fee is mandatory, to be truly transparent it should be included in the main advertised price - why have a separate (hidden) fee at all if it is mandatory? Having done some digging, the fee actually covers things like 'free' wifi, a welcome drink and a bottle of water in your room upon arrival. That being the case, guests should have the option of whether to purchase these goods/services and be charged accordingly. This was by far the biggest let down for us and I'm afraid any retort suggesting the charging is transparent is simply not true. - The shower is big but the shower pressure is low. - The quality of the room is generally good, but there are signs of wear and tear creeping in. Hopefully the hotel will keep on top of this. - New York is New York and it's noisy night and day. The Hotel is on Broadway and as you'd expect we heard sirens from time-to-time. The sirens were however somewhat more frequent than you'd expect and we learnt a few days into our stay there was what appears to be a fire station just across the street. Ask for a room at the back of the hotel if you're after some peace and quiet!SUMMARYOverall a good hotel, particularly if you're looking for something a little different / edgey! However, just make sure you take into account the 'hidden' daily facility fee when you're pricing it up, otherwise you may be in for an expensive shock!","Sheffield, United Kingdom","milliemoohippo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sheffield, United Kingdom</strong>",12,3.0

The hotel has many good points and some minuses as well. First the downside. Rooms are very small. As in really really small. My room needed a fresh coat of paint as there were skid marks across some of the walls. The bathroom, glass, shower door had a large crack in it. The mattress was way too soft. I think the interior decor of the common areas and the rooms themselves need to be updated. The common areas are particularly dark. On the plus side, the location is ideal for shopping, eating, Central Park, and the Lincoln Center. The staff was friendly and well trained. The concierge was most helpful in giving us advice on how to get around. While small, the rooms were clean and the cleaning staff was friendly and helpful. A real plus is the hard wood floors. We chose a package that included a continental breakfast, which was not a bad value considering New York prices. In fact, the restaurant in the hotel, Serafina, was pretty good. It wasn't the best food I've ever eaten, but the quantity of food was impressive for the price paid, and the service was good.All in all this hotel is more like a 3.5, than a 4. It was not well appointed enough to be on that scale. However, it's selling points are its convenience, staff and overall good value.

This is supposed to be for all of the things that they advertise as ""included"" (wi-fi, gym, etc), but have now decided to charge for. For a 7-night stay, that comes to $216. With NYC tax, hotel occupancy tax and the Urban Fee, the fees and taxes on this room came out to be nearly $500 for the week. Come on, Nylo! Really??

I liked it the first time, but liked it even more this second time. For the price and location, I don't think you can find a better hotel in NYC. Including fees and taxes, our average per night price was around $285. We booked a couple weeks in advance. That is a great price for NYC. At that price, you can't expect the Ritz, but this is a newly furnished and decorated place. It is not run down, although the furniture in the room is sparse, the rooms are good sized for NYC. This is a pet-friendly hotel, so the rooms have a composite (not carpet) floor. If you like carpet, don't stay here. Despite it being pet friendly, the rooms are very nice. Also, I didn't see many pets (a few small dogs). My only issue with the pet-friendly status is that I checked in at about 1:00 p.m., went to my room, and a dog was down the hall barking. It barked for the entire afternoon. If people have pets, the hotel should have their cell number so that the guest can be contacted if the pet is being disruptive.My only other criticism relates to the quality of beer at the bar. When we were there, they had Blue Moon, Sam Adams, and a Goose Island IPA. That's better than Bud Lite, but not much better. I would suggest some Bass, Harp and Guinness or some micro-brew beers. The lobby/lounge area is great. We spent a lot of time there every night, but I would have spent more time there if they had a better beer selection. In addition to the hotel being great, you can't beat this location. It is one block from the 1 train (79th Street), and about 3 blocks (72 Street) from the 1, 2 and 3 trains. You can get anywhere in the city very easily from this hotel. Times Square is only 5 minutes away. Plus, there is quite a bit of shopping on Broadway (especially around the 72nd Street station) and many, many bars and restaurants along Broadway and Amsterdam and all the side streets. We went to Stand Up NY, which is a comedy club a block away, and the show was better than anything we've seen at the bigger NYC clubs. Fish Tags is a block or two away -- great sea food, and one of my favorite bars anywhere (Fred's) is at 83rd and Amsterdam. There are so many great drinking and eating places within a few blocks of this hotel, and these are not touristy places. Again, will all the competing bars in the neighborhood, the hotel lounge needs to up its game on beer selection.Really though, I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The place fits me, but I can see were it may be too casual for some people. This feels like a homey place to me, it isn't swanky or lavish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","Bluetornado0811</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",24,5.0

The water pressure in the shower wasn’t great too. However the main reason I give this hotel only 4 stares is because the hotel charges a fee of $25 per night for using utilities like the WiFi and the gym (that’s also includes the pool which is closed during the winter).

Lovely people and gave us a wonderful start to our holiday.Their service remained fantastic every time we saw them.So onto the hotel itself.A warm and inviting reception and bar area made you feel at ease straight away.The room is small but clean and decorated nicely. The view was a brick wall, but it's new you'll and we were here for the city and not the hotel. The maid service was very good and the only thing missing from the room was a fridge which would have been really useful.The location is exceptional. Easy walk to 72nd or 79th subway and only a couple of blocks from Central Park. Nicely away from the noise of Times Square and alike.The bar is the one let down of the NYLO, expensive and and the service was poor but just a short walk to around 81st and Amsterdam / Columbus finds lots of good bars and food.As for food it was very good in the attached restaurant but again quite pricy. For breakfast take a walk down to 72nd, we loved Cafe 71 but there are other choices.

I have tried to overlook the rude staff in the past, however, this time it was just intolerable. It began with my mother's room being ""aired out"" because someone had smoked in her room - however, they didn't tell her that and it smelled so horrible that she had to go down and wait in the lobby for hours for the smell to clear. The staff didn't offer to comp a night or give her another room. This was especially upsetting given that my mother is elderly, had checked in at night after a long flight, and was then forced to wait for a room that stank the entire time. The second major issue we had was regarding the charge on the credit card for incidentals. I realize that this is standard procedure. However, it was not clearly disclosed to my mother that her card would have a pending charge of $200 which was the limit on that card (the only one she brought). I paid for the room and I was happy to give my credit card, but they insisted that the card must be swipped in person. I have a 6 month old infant and i could not go to the hotel in person. When I explained the situation they were EXTREMELY rude and insisted that the charge would not be lifted until 5 DAYS AFTER check out. Again, this was not properly disclosed to my elderly mother who was surprised to find this out from her credit card company. Money is not an issue for me, and I understand that this is a standard policy. The issues were: It was not clearly disclosed to my mother AND the staff was EXTREMELY RUDE. Furthermore, nothing was offered to make my mother's stay more pleasant despite her being forced to wait for hours for a smoke-polluted room. The service and attitude of the staff is unacceptable. Absolutely horrible. ","New York City, New York","Shalva W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",1,1.0

The location is perfect for people like us who want to enjoy Manhattan without the congestion and insanity of midtown and Times Sq. Just 3 blocks to Central Park, shopping, dining, and beautiful sites are literally right outside the door. The first time we stayed, we were given a decent sized room with a rooftop balcony and city view. This time around, we were given a regular room considerably smaller than our first and our view was of the rooms on the opposite side of the building. Not a big deal since we didn't plan on sunbathing or stargazing! Our only complaint is parking!! We had a Groupon for $38 for Icon parking which is a steal in the city but only 2 Icons were within 6 blocks (not a field day if you travel with lots of luggage). Spot Hero app had a few spots available but VERY pricey - $60/day+. We found one for $35 but 6 blocks away. I believe the hotel has valet service but I had already purchased the Groupon so we went with that. If you are driving in, either confirm with the front desk that they have valet (???) or make sure you have a parking space in the area.....otherwise...GOOD LUCK finding one!! THAT is not on the hotel, but be aware! We have not yet tried Serafina so we can't say anything about them, however we have tried the Meatball Factory on Amsterdam - FUNFUNFUN menu and great food!!!

He is a doll and I told him I want him to be my son, since I have 2 daughters and no sons! I also love Danny and Orlando. Everyone who works there really is wonderful!The bar is probably my second favorite thing about the NYLO. It has a nice ambience about it; I love the lighting and how one side is higher than the other. Their cocktails are always good and I eat too many of their delicious little bar snacks. There is something about the bar which has an easy feeling and lends itself to talking to the interesting person sitting next to you.Lastly, did I mention the NYLO accepts dog guests?

Booked through Expedia. Stayed in room 821.The pros: good location, 2 blocks from the subway and v close to Central Park. Quirky bar with nice selection of drinks, and seems locals come here to the bar too, so nice to not be surrounded by just us tourists. We were given a token each for a glass of champagne when we checked in which was a nice touch. Under bed lights are cool! Bed was super comfy, good mattress and comfy pillows. (Side note is that the bed is very high up if you're like me and only just 5 ft! I felt like a toddler trying to climb up a mountain to get into it, but totally worth it, slept very well here). Room decor is nice, well lit inside room too. The cons: room was v small and we had 2 tiny tiny windows in the room which faced directly onto a brick wall about 2 feet away so we had no natural light at all while we were here unless you put the lights in the room on. We were suckered by the photos showing big windows on 2 or 3 walls of the room and great views of the city but nope, brick walls was what we got! The floor of the room was dusty and gritty when we checked in, under the bed was fluffy and dusty which we wouldn't have noticed I guess had it not been for the underbed lights. This didn't get any better through the week, though we did get clean towels through the week. Many of the power sockets in the room didn't work (2 on the right-side of the bed, couple by the door, one in the bathroom) but there are others to use so not a huge problem. Food in the bar is brought through from the adjoining Italian restaurant (Seraphina) - and we ate here a couple of times which was a mistake. We ordered calamari and sliders, waited an age for them to arrive and then both were absolutely stone cold. They must have sat on the pass somewhere for 10-15 mins once cooked while the hapless staff forgot to go and get them. I ordered a mojito and that too was a mistake - totally vile. Too tired to challenge it, having just landed from the UK so gave up. We gave the food another chance later in the week but had the same issues. Cold. Redeeming point here goes to Anna the barmaid, who made our cocktails the next time around and knows what she's doing. Overall: we would come back but wish we'd raised the issues. on their own they seemed small but soon stacked up and it spoiled the experience - i was there for my 30th and i wanted it to be perfect.

The lobby and bar areas are fantastic, and the location cannot be beat. The rooms could use a little bit of TLC - but not a lot. They're mostly very clean (although there were a couple of stray hairs on the shower curtain) and in good repair (still, could use some paint touch-ups and tile refreshing in the shower/tub). Not a huge room, but not too small, either. Beds were a bit soft for us, but the climate control was great. The exterior windows could use a good washing, but it's NYC in the winter, so dirty windows were not a big surprise. Overall, though, I felt the room was clean and nicely designed. We were happy there. We appreciated the free champagne and the interior link to Serafina for a nice breakfast. The staff was gracious and helpful. We used the valet service, and that was great for us. All in all, a really nice option.","Middlebury, Vermont","JBfromVT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Middlebury, Vermont</strong>",6,4.0

I will go out of my way to stay at their properties anywhere in the world. And when I had to be in New York City for one night, I of course, looked at the Starwood options first. But most of them were either sold out for the night I needed, or were priced starting at $600/night. After doing a bit of research, I saw that the Nylo in NYC was offering an amazing special for $99/night. I'm not terribly price-sensitive, but having stayed at the Nylo in Dallas and knowing the style of the hotel, I couldn't pass up this deal.Arriving at the Nylo, I was immediately greeted by a friendly doorman who offered to take my bags. I didn't need his help, but the quick greeting was very welcome. I made my way into the stylish and hip lobby, with some great sitting areas and a nice bar, and found my way to the front desk. The guy who checked me in was nice and even accommodated a late check out for me. In my few interactions with the front desk during the stay, I felt that the staff were helpful, though, some were more friendly than others. The lobby was pretty busy and looked like a great place to hang out.My room was a standard king room and was pretty tiny with views of the surrounding buildings. Okay, I didn't pay a lot and don't have any status with this chain, so I get it. It felt a bit claustrophobic, BUT the style of the room is very modern and clean. The bed linens were very comfy and the bathroom was modern and well-maintained. It was a style very similar to the W hotels, which is what I'm mostly used to, though a bit less lavish. As it was NYC, I didn't spend a lot of time in the room, so the size wasn't such a big issue. I wished I had had more time at the hotel itself, but NYC is so exciting, it's hard to stay inside. I didn't utilize the gym, dining venue or bar, though the hotel had a great, cozy vibe. And the friendly guy with the beard working the bar was great to look at, as well as friendly, even though I didn't need anything while I was just waiting for my ride to the airport.I would definitely recommend this hotel. It's right in the middle of the Upper West Side, so there are more than enough great bars and restaurants in the area to stay busy. The Nylo is also just blocks from Central Park.

We chose NYLO. It was a reasonable price. We had read the rooms were small-ish but we didn't mind that. We had 3 people in our room (parents, one 16-year old) and although it was small it was nice and we were comfortable. We were 2 blocks from the 1 Train, which made it easy to go to Midtown as well as to our son's apartment. The hotel is clean. The concierge was helpful. The bar and sitting area was especially nice because it was cold outside and we did sit and use those. Also there are 2 restaurants attached to the hotel, which is very convenient. There is a CVS across the street. The beds were a little too soft, which made my back hurt, but it's hard to complain about a soft bed. It is noisy when emergency vehicles go by, which seemed kind of often, but you don't get street noise. It was convenient, clean and we enjoyed staying there.

The only downside is that they only offer Pinot Grigio as their white. Bar is lively and great place to hang out if you get in late. - Our room was big and bed was perfect. We stayed street side and while you could hear the traffic I didn't mind as I like a little white noise. There is a fire station next door so a few times during the night that was loud but not too loud. - HVAC system is loud when it is on but once again if you don't mind white noise it's not an issue. - Desk staff are helpful. The only issue we have which is a good tip - when we arrived to get our car in the morning it takes 45 min to hour. We were hoping to get on the road earlier.

One of the waitresses was quite rude and abrupt and seemed insulted when I gave her a $1 tip when spending $10 on one beer and a complimentary champagne, despite her not having to move as I was at the bar. The room was very nice, the bed super comfy and the maids left the room spotless. However, in our room, we had a door which led to an adjoining room and this meant we heard everything which was being said by the guests staying in the room next-door. The air conditioning was also horrendously loud. Even in December, it was very hot and we ended up wearing ear plugs to block out the AC noise. Unfortunately, throughout our six night stay, we didn't have a single night of decent, uninterrupted sleep.As for location, we loved the fact that the hotel is two blocks away from central park and a 2 minute walk from the Subway which takes you right into downtown Manhattan. There are also some nice bars and restaurants in the area. Red Farm was fantastic. If we return to New York we will stay in the same area, but probably not NYLO.

Originally I made reservations at the Hotel Beacon, where I've stayed several times in the past, for a room with two double beds. When I got the confirmation, though, it indicated no more than two adults and one small child were allowed in a room with two double beds. Truthfully, we discussed the idea of the four of us staying in the room and hoping to get away with it, but decided it wasn't a good idea since we didn't want to be kicked out of the room on a cold winter night - LOL!. The price of a suite where they allowed four people was more than we wanted to spend, so I started doing a search for another hotel on the Upper West Side and found the NYLO, which had no problem with the four of us staying in a room with two double beds.The reservation process was easy and efficient, and the woman with whom I spoke was very nice. When we arrived, we were impressed with the lobby, library and bar. The 12th floor room, while small, was very clean, quiet and comfortable with great mattresses (important after walking around the city all day, or enduring white-knuckle cab rides, particularly the one where the driver vehemently threw the ""F"" bomb at other vehicles many, many, MANY times!). In the bathroom, the lack of actual towel racks other than the hook on the back of the door was odd, but once again, everything was spotless.All staff members were polite, friendly and helpful, which was appreciated.

The desk and door staff were all exceptional and seemed genuinely friendly, warm, hospitable. We were given a few vouchers for free drinks at the lobby bar, which has a cool atmosphere and is usually busy and lively. The only negative was that the two bartenders were somewhat rude and dismissive when we asked for drinks 10 minutes after closing (it was still full of people and we'd been told the wrong closing time). The concierge said they might have some bottles they hadn't put away yet and they could still serve us. I'm not sure if this annoyed the bartenders but they were visibly unhappy with pouring a couple free drinks. I still tipped them but only because it's the right thing to do, not because they provided good service.

Its 3 minutes from Central Park, the subway is a 5 minute walk and gets you to times square in about 12 minutes and you can stay on and get to the financial district in double that time. If you are young and want to party / perhaps visit brooklyn, then dont stay on the upper west. Stay in the east village or anywhere lower east.The staff are ok. They are by no means rude but they're a bit muted and dull. The biggest two problems with the Nylo are the room sizes and unexpected costs. The room was pretty small. You couldn't spend an evening in there without feeling quite suppressed. Granted, our room had two double beds and ensuite - but there wasnt a lot of room to move about (but dont forget you are in NY so you shouldnt be stating in your hotel room a lot anyway!) However, the decor of the rooms and entire hotel is very nice.My biggest gripe was the unexpected costs at checkout! Like all my hotel bookings, I used expedia, so I wasn't expecting any surprising charges. However, for a 7 night stay I was hit with a $200 urban and tax fee. This made up about 25-30% of the cost of staying at the hotel. I would have much rather used this money to stay somewhere else and got a bigger room",,Rosh P,0,3.0

The NYLO really fell short. Our family recently had to emergency move from our upper west side apartment two blocks from the Nylo. We chose the Nylo because of its proximity and because the reviews generally seemed positive. The lack of compassion and warmth from reservations to front desk to management was astounding. When you spend $700 a night on a room - you expect a level of service - and our experience was so undermet, we will never recommend this hotel to any friend, family member or stranger. We strongly suggest you consider other options. Here are just a few of the reasons we were so extremely dissatisfied: - When I first called, I was given a quote for the room rate and I said I'd call back in ten minutes after speaking with my husband. Within that timeframe, the hotel upped the rate by $400+.- When I called to get further clarification on why the rate has changed, the hotel was experiencing phone problems. I spoke to 6 people and got 6 different responses but no one could give us the original lower rate.- When I called reservations and was asking specific questions about how the room was laid out (important for anyone who has ever tried to travel with children), the reservation desk couldn't tell me anything about the room type I was inquiring about, despite its cost. - When I desperately explained our situation and requested an early check in - I was told ""sorry - there's a waitlist and maybe we'll call you if you can check in early."" I was literally standing at the desk with tears in my eyes and there was ZERO humanity in the conversation. Then, I never got a call - not even when check in time had already passed. - When we walked in with 2 kids, a dog, 4 bags, there was no one to greet us, open a door or help with luggage. - When we finally got ourselves into the room, there was someone else's bag of Chipotle sitting in the room. There were also light bulbs missing from lamps and a window had been left open. - When the manager, who I'd been advised to talk to because she would have the ablity to make rate changes - finally came on duty - and I explained our circumstances - she looked annoyed that I was even asking to have a conversation.",Nyc,"margots894</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nyc</strong>",1,1.0

The last few years, we've stayed at the NYLO because it's convenient to the Beacon Theatre where we regularly attend their holiday programming. We will not be returning to this hotel again.Firstly, this year we planned to stay 3 nights and paid an additional $120 fee for a ""higher floor."" The first room that they tried to give us was a tiny closet on the 12th floor 3 feet from the elevators. When we asked for another room, a specifically requested that we NOT be placed near an elevator, we were given a room on the 11th floor...right next to the other elevator. Seriously?We have up, and decided to cut our losses and stay in the second room anyway. It's noisy and there is a connection door which enables us to hear every moment of the neighbors next door, in addition to the endless elevator noise.Then we went to the bar. We asked the bartender for a bottle of sparkling wine. She poured two glasses. When we told her that we had asked her for a bottle, not two glasses, she told us that she had to charge us FOR HER MISTAKE because ""it was already in the system."" How's that for customer service? She then proceeded to charge us for two glasses of wine AND the bottle. This is not a hotel that values service or customers. There are too many other hotels within shouting distance of this place. We won't be returning to hotel NYLO.Update: The connecting door to the next room provided ZERO insulation or privacy. So we were lucky enough to hear strangers arguing then having sex (luckily, neither for very long) making it nearly impossible to sleep.During check-out we learned that the previously mentioned bartender DOUBLE charged us, charging both our credit card directly and then the room. Incredibly dishonest.And to top it all off, NYLO still charged us for the $120.51 room ""upgrade"" which we never received.We definitely won't return.",Oakland,"8jd2016</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland</strong>",0,1.0

We had a wheelchair user with us and they accommodated this very well. On arrival we were greeted by a very helpful doorman who took our bags up to our room, there is a cage lift for wheelchairs and pushchairs that is operated by the doorman, if he is not at the door, someone at reception will help promptly. Our room was 204, it was a very large room with two double beds, large tv with good choice of channels, sofa, arm chair, safe and very large bathroom. Only down point is that there was no view from the windows, they were actually blacked out. Bathroom was a wet room and the shower takes agessss to warm up, but wasn't really a big issue. Staff were friendly and helpful. They offer a private taxi to the airport for $75 dollars, they said this includes toll bridge and tip, yet the taxi driver still asked for a tip?!?! So be careful with that. Also had to pay £200 security fee on a credit card on check in (refundable)Then £145 on check out for ""amenities"" the room didn't even have a proper kettle just a really bad coffee machine, so paying this much is a big extreme, especially when you're paying $500+ per night! But as they said it's in the ""small print"" on booking confirmation, however I feel this should be mentioned before booking!!Good points:-mostly clean-great friendly and helpful staff-central location-close to public transportation-great bar and free drink per person-joined onto a very good restaurant which offers takeaway Bad points:-Shower leaks into the room from under the door -hidden costs- under sink dirty-down side of beds very dusty-shower curtain needs to be changedOverall a good stay and beautifully decorated.

The desk clerks and doormen were polite and helpful. There is a bar in the hotel (you get two chits for free house wine or draft beer) and a restaurant in the building on the Broadway side--the hotel entrance is actually on 77th Street near Broadway. The hotel has recently been renovated in a modern style with stainless steel bathroom vanity and sink, modern lamps and décor, laminate flooring, etc. There are 30 minutes free computer time at a sitting at the business center in the lobby with free printing. There is free WiFi in the rooms. The hotel location is very convenient if you are operating on the Upper West Side. It's near the American Museum of Natural History, as many restaurants as you could possibly want, Trader Joe's at 72nd and Broadway, and the number 1 subway at 79th Street and Broadway and express trains 2 and 3 at the 72nd Street and Broadway station.

Central Park and Riverside Park are just blocks away, the neighbourhood can't be beat. The staff are excellent! Lenny the doorman is amazing, he genuinely cares about his job and treats the guests with amazing service, he's the best doorman in NYC! Johanna from the office staff is amazing! She takes care of me every time I come to the city and has gotten to know me personally as a guest of the NYLO! She has exceptional customer service and is a true professional. Rosa in reservations is so great, she is always on top of things and makes sure my reservations are handled efficiently and accurately. The entire staff at this hotel are worth mentioning because they are truly valued employees: Cris, Alberto, Gregory, Eduardo, Jose, Daniel are all excellent! Ben is the friendliest fellow and best server in the NYLO lounge- a true pleasure! And the front desk staff from Ramona, Eloyd, Tasha, Jessie who all go beyond to take care of their guests with the superb professionalism! The managers at the front desk are truly exceptional, Matt & Ranata, they are obviously doing great work hiring such fine employees. The housekeeping staff are the best, Saha on the 7th floor and Meria on 14th &16th floors especially, they work hard to make your stay a pleasurable one. People who don't often get mentioned are hotel maintenance staff such as Raul and Mervin, I need to say these fellows are friendly, helpful and a pleasure to deal with!

We were disappointed with the view from the room we were given (expected city views from the website room description and photos - instead we looked directly onto a building that was undergoing construction). We called down to the front desk and they were able to move us to another room with a much better view for our second night. Both rooms though were clean and large by NYC standards. Bed was comfy and had plenty of pillows. Both rooms had balconies with chairs outside - but it was too cold and windy to take advantage of the outdoor space. My only complaint about the rooms are the bathrooms are small and need more/better lighting. The rooms could use more lighting too (high hats on both sides of the room would help when you need to go through your bag or suitcase to find something). Check out was fast and the doormen and valet were great. Overall a really nice boutique style hotel. In walking distance to many great restaurants, museums and Central Park.

I gave it two tries after it had been bought and turned into NYLO – both times during its renovations – and was less than thrilled with the new direction. It went ""loft"" and hip/trendy which did not reflect the neighborhood or give me the warm and fuzzy feeling that originally captivated me.But I am here to say I am back to liking this hotel a lot, and expect to grow to love it again in the future.First of all: the location is perfect. You can have your mid-town and downtown, the Upper West Side gives you the best of both worlds NYC has to offer. It is an actual neighborhood and is, for Manhattan, quiet. The city is not right on top of you, but you can hop in a taxi or subway down Broadway and be where the theaters or whatever are in minutes. Plus, having Sarabeth's, the Natural History Museum and Central Park just two blocks away is amazing.Secondly, the new (to me) lobby is astounding! Maybe the best hotel lobby I have experienced. Besides the front desk it includes a bar (which opens out to the sidewalk when the weather allows), soft sitting area with piano, and a large ""library"" where you can sit and chat with friends, play chess, use your laptop or one of their two computer stations and printer, have a drink, or watch Game 7 of the World Series, as I did. It truly feels like a very inviting living room that happens to have a hotel on top of it.The rooms are a mixed bag, to be honest. Those facing 77th Street are less desirable than the ones facing Broadway...and the higher the better. But hotel-wide you cannot beat the über-comfortable bed and excellent bathrooms (most with large showers). Lovely hardwood floors throughout, as well. Some of their furnishings are not what I would have chosen, but nothing's perfect.Finally, the people are fantastic. From Lenny the doorman (who has been here for 11 years and honestly remembered me when I first walked in after a 3-year hiatus) to Tasha at the front desk and the other front of the house and housekeeping staff, everyone greets you with a smile and warm greeting, and do their best to assist. There were a couple of communication glitches during this stay that prevent me from giving them an ""excellent"" rating, but nothing that caused a real problem...and they were quick to remedy the situations when asked.A special comment must be made for the new General Manager of NYLO. There are two types of hotel GMs: those whom you never see and who manage from their office, and those who are out there with the staff every day, making sure the guests and employees know they are being looked after. Connie is the second type and could not have been more welcoming and helpful.The Upper West Side is a special area in New York City. It would take me another 3,000 characters to type in why...so I won't ask for any more of your time. My point is, NYLO is a hotel that is on track to reflect the neighborhood even more than it does at present, and already has the facilities and charm that brought me back so many times in the past 14 years. I am looking forward to my future stays here!","Cambridge, Massachusetts","JFHcambridge</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, Massachusetts</strong>",9,4.0

The only thing saving this Gotham lodging from going completely overboard is the fact that their linens, lamps, and mattresses aren't for sale.One of the issues staying in NYC is always the noise and this trendy abode doesn't do anything to assuage that concern. Not only is the lobby and the so-called library outrageously loud with music, people, and motion, but the rooms are all hardwood floors with ample gaps under the doors so noise from the hallway is pervasive at all hours and there is no door dampening so your neighbor's slamming the door is literally felt inside your room. The bathrooms come in stylish stainless steel which makes for even more noise...more like staying on a Navy submarine at 6 fathoms under than being on the 6th floor of posh. Drafty windows which don't look out on anything but the wall next door were to be expected but again, noise from the street made it's way through them as well. Cheesy plastic cups and a safe for storage which is on the floor making it impossible to see your ""secret combination"" move you from hipster hotel to mundane motel.Bright spots include a great location to much of this side of NYC and I will say that the waitstaff in the bar and restaurant were affable and helpful. Additionally the shower was a bit better than most NYC hotels, plenty of hot water, a good well lit stall, and a pleasant hand-held wand. Truly, for NYC a good value for the dollar spent (even if the others in my business group got drink coupons in their key holder and I did not...sigh).","Carlsbad, California","SandyEggo4Fun</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carlsbad, California</strong>",13,4.0

The lobby opens onto 77th Street instead of the more traveled Broadway, which can make entering a cab a hassle in the rain. The door men are inattentive as I had to struggle with the heavy lobby doors my self every time I entered or exited the building. The room decor is dark with exposed brick walls and kindergarten-like colorful doors covering cubes to store belongings. You can hang your clothes in the small closet which included an iron, ironing board, and luggage rack. WiFi is free. The bathroom had a shower but no tub. There were no hooks or racks in the bathroom to hang towels or clothes which was awkward. The desk and chair were comfortable for working on my lap top and there were plenty of outlets to charge my devices. I liked the convenience of the Keurig coffee maker -- but all of those pods are hardly green. I asked for a quiet room -- and it was -- but it faced an alley. If you want to sleep late, consider wearing ear plugs -- the room doors are heavy and you can hear doors of your neighbors slam shut as they exit. The hotel location is very good for tourists as the Museum of Natural History, Central Park, Historical Society, etc., are just a short walk away. It is also convenient to 2 different subway lines. There is a Marshall's discount clothing store nearby on Broadway in case you have some time to browse for a bargain.","New York City, New York","Diane L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",22,4.0

First, the room was pretty dirty (hairs in sink, bedside table, cupboards), the bathroom was far from clean, and there were food crumbs on the floor and and a biscuit wrapper in the cupboard. I didn't complain at the time because I didn't want to get the cleaner /housekeeping into trouble, and cleaned it up myself. Maybe I was just unlucky with my particular room (which was great otherwise!) But even so, I'd say standards are slipping at NYLO NYC, which is a shame. That said, I'd probably give it one final chance for its location and fairly reasonable prices (by Manhattan standards) alone.","London, United Kingdom","James S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",9,4.0

It literally felt and sounded like they were in the room, collecting hotel trash and construction trash for a job across the street. This went on for at least 20 minutes.

If middle of the night trash collection is the norm, NYLO at the very least needs to insulate the room windows to cut down on the noise.","Denver, Colorado","_lmglevin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",8,3.0

This time, we were travelling as a group of four (two couples). We enjoy the fact we're close to both Central Park and Riverside Park, close to some great restaurants, pubs, shops, grocery markets and a subway stop that makes it easy to get to other parts of Manhattan. We feel like we're a part of the neighborhood during our stays and often meet local residents in the lobby bar, which has a great vibe. The staff handling the entrance area/luggage/rides etc., is excellent. On previous trips, we found the front desk to be below standard. This trip, they were very good. In fact, one day I had an issue with the printer in the lobby and a person from the front desk was eager to try to help and got it running again in a matter of minutes. Our check-in and check-out was handled efficiently and we didn't experience any glitches. The room isn't anything flashy, but clean and very space efficient with a modern industrial look matching the rest of the hotel. For us, the room is basically where we go to sleep, rest, shower. Otherwise, we're out and about. We pick the NYLO largely because of its UWS location.","Dartmouth, Canada","G0rdieS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dartmouth, Canada</strong>",11,4.0

There was work going on on the sidewalk which started at 7 am. As I am sure they would have been advised of this work, we received no advice that this was going to happen and so hence we were all rudely awakened at 7 every morning.

When we paid the bill the hotel immediately charged my card without letting me view the invoice to check it first. The smoke detector light in the room flashed all night every night.

As I was treating myself at a total cost of $312 dollars (not including breakfast) I had high expectations. Despite having booked and paid for the room in March I was told on arrival that my room had been cancelled but that they did not know why. I showed the receptionist my confirmation emails and subsequent email to confirm the payment I had made, I was told that they had no record of payment and that I would have to contact the website I had booked it through. I was then told I had not shown up in May even though I was not in the States at that point and was asked if I had booked my room on that date, I had not and again showed the confirmation email, The staff member went and got the hotel manger who when came out was not remotely friendly, She barely looked at me, didn't say hello nor apologise for the confusion. She then said I was due to come to the hotel on 3rd which was in fact that day, She didn't apologise for her error and I was left feeling like I was the one who had made the mistake. Her parting words were that it ""should"" be ok and that she's let me know if not. Not a particularly welcoming, friendly or reassuring start, to my stay.I'd requested a room on a specific floor but as my booking had been lost this wasn't fulfilled. The room was quite small but I'm not sure if this is standard across the hotel. The iron didn't work properly nor was there a bath - again I'm not sure if this is standard in Manhattan hotels? For the amount of money I paid for one night I felt like I was staying in a budget hotel with a particularly unwelcoming management team.

I was called and told I had to get a more expensive room because of my scooter. I explained this was illegal as it was limiting my access to the hotel. I finally agreed to the surcharge asking for an email confirming the new rate and that I would talk to manager on arrival. Confirmation came with same rates so we assumed the clerk had talked to management and corrected the error. We checked in at the rate given in email. Upon check out, there was a $50/day surcharge for the larger room. It took too long to find someone to take the surcharge off our bill while a car waited to take us to the airport. Other than that, the only problem was that the first night we had to completely flush the hot water through pipes because it started out looking like blood because it was so dirty or rusty or really, who cares. That's the bad, the good is that the beds are comfy, the room clean, staff very attentive. The Serafina restaurant, which serves as the hotel's restaurant, was good but the service was inattentive.

There is nothing to this hotel at all to make it worth $740/night. They have no room service, repeat...no room service, you have to go outside the hotel to get anything.

I was there for 8 nights for work, nothing special for the time invested here, no upgrade, waters were only replaced in the room when asked, key to the room failed to work every single day at least once.

It's an outrageous sum for an online booking. In addition, the hotel just implemented a $25 (plus tax) ""Urban Fee"" for access to Wifi, the workout facilities and terrace, plus two bottles of water and a ""complimentary"" drink. It's a BS fee that they apparently feel they could get away with, because of the tight hotel space in Manhattan.

Red Farm is a MUST GO restaurant on your list. However, the hotel was far from luxury. The rooms are (claustrophobic) small. Our bathroom had a strong smell of musty wetness, the vents were covered with layers of dust caked in. The bathroom ammenities are nothing special, plain and ordinary. The beds were comfortable but the pillows are extremely lumpy - have no idea what is in them. Out of 8 pillows I couldn't find one smooth enoughto sleep on. Air conditioning fan was extremely noisy. Windows were crusted with a layer of dirt. A vent by the front door of the hotel leaked on top of people coming in and out of the hotel for 3 days. There was no doorman on duty to say hello when you came in, and to be honest I don't know that I saw a bellman on duty the entire stay - he was always ""busy"" around the property. But most concerning was the attitude of a manager at Serafina, the hotel restaurant. When we arrived at 2 pm, the room was not ready, so we headed to the restaurant for a couple of hours. The wait staff suggested we leave our bags by a table near the bar in a completely empty section. At one point a manager came in and started yelling toward the couple of occupied tables spread out that the person who left the bags there should come and get them. After we removed our bags he proceeded to sit at precisely that table in an empty section (!) to have a conversation with the barmaid. The waiter was apologetic and offered to remove our bags; I could tell even he was embarrassed. As a manager, he could have asked the waiters who the bags belong to and nicely request that they be removed or simply sit at another table.

I am a travel agent and immediately checked the hotel website for the upgraded room rate and it was $100.00 LESS than my original room rate. Not only would they not honor that online room rate for the first night, they insisted that my second night was also $75.00 extra.They explained that I should understand as a travel agent that their hotel is a revenue creating business and that they need to make money and were TOTALLY unwilling to provide customer satisfaction as a goal.I have stayed at Fairmonts, Westins, Marriott, Intercontinental and many other hotel chains and they have been thrilled to please the customer and usually will offer a upgrade if room is NOT as described and ALWAYS honor their own hotel website rates.

I arrive the next morning and a man from security said my package was not there, had never arrived, told me that I was wrong and that I needed to get tracking to prove it was there. Meanwhile, this is Labor Day weekend and no one is at my office to get tracking until Tuesday. I wait, get tracking, tell them that R .

Upon checking out, my coworker went to the front to pick up something that another coworker, who'd flown out early that morning, had left with her. The front desk woman said she had been there all morning and had seen no such thing. She argued with my coworker until the point that we asked for the manager on duty. A Hispanic man in a striped shirt walked out and argued, then raised his voice at my coworker, telling her that it's against hotel policy to keep things up front for other guests and they would've never accepted what was left for her (a room key!). Keep in mind, we needed this room key because our other coworker had close to $10k worth of things from a production that we needed to have shipped home. Meanwhile, the women goes over to an accordion folder by the front desk and pulls out an envelope with my coworkers name one it and the room key we were looking for! We all stare in amazement at the manager, waiting for an apology, then his face turns red and he walks away without another word.My coworker walks away and the front desk woman has the audacity to say to me,""all she had to do was say her name and we would've found the envelope.""

SHE is the customer and you and especially your manager should never talk to customers like that no matter the situation.""

The negative side: Did not like the shower - it was a handheld only and the bar was too short; there was no bar - just a curtain, so water got everywhere; the water took forever to get warm and it never got hot. The floor in the room was kind of dirty. The iron leaked water.

We liked the look of the contemporary decor and we weren't disappointed. Hotel was lovely. Excellent location we could walk to Times Square but also close to subway as well. We ended up buying a week subway ticket to make sure we could get around a bit quicker and see everything we'd planned. Plenty of great places to eat nearby and cvs pharmacy opposite sells snacks and drinks. This is quite a residential area so there are plenty of food markets on Broadway too. Don't let you put you off though as the quieter location is a welcome rest from the intensity of Times Square and major tourist spots. Only a couple of blocks to Central Park which is great for an morning/evening walk.Hotel was great huge comfy bed and usb charging points at both sides. Safe, hairdryer and machine to make tea and coffee. We were on the 9th floor facing Broadway - quiet with a good view. Our room was right outside the lift but we're not disturbed at all. There wasn't any info in the room but a quick call to reception and we found out there was an ice machine on 12th floor (also vending machine with cold drinks). Big tv in the room which was good to catch the weather/morning news before venturing out. Air conditioning was good but quite loud to have on all the time. It was really hot while we were there but found auto mode adequate (it just coming on occasionally to maintain temp).Hotel staff were very helpful and stored our bags from check out until we left for our evenings flight. We had emailed the hotel who could have helped arrange transport from/to airport but we ended up booking the shared super shuttle from the airport. This was ok but next time we would book private super shuttle or even get the subway. Wifi connection very good and there were also some computers in the lobby although we didn't need to use them. Plenty of places to sit in the lounge (including table with chess set). Locl bar very nice and has a small menu - food from Serafina restaurant next door.

Its a trendy, 'hip' hotel with a decent bar, board games and chess in the lobby, and a nice little terrace on the 16th floor. Our room was spacious, enormously comfortable and faultlessly clean (it is worth noting though, there are noisy building works across 77th St so no lie ins!)However, our first impression of the hotel was an awful one thanks to the way we were greeted by the front desk and the fact I was reduced to tears before even checking in.When we arrived, we were told that we could not check in to the room (which we had already paid for) without them putting a holding payment on a credit card. We had not been forewarned about this but presented them with two cards to try, without complaint. They could not use these bank cards however, as our UK banks wouldn't let a overseas holding payment be processed at that time until we completed a standard security check - we could not do this as only checked in guests can access the hotel wifi. The staff member on the desk was rude and unreasonable about this and insisted that check-in was not at all possible for us.Seeing as we had paid for the room in full already, I thought this was ridiculous. How could we, as paying guests, be denied our own hotel room? I even offered two alternatives to the staff on the desk: I could pay a cash deposit or they could take my card details for later reference, once I'd had an opportunity to call my bank and confirm it was me making the payment. He declined both offers and again insisted that we could not be allowed to check-in.How was this resolved? The hotel backed down in the end and let us check-in to our room, but only when the staff member involved realised that a jetlagged, sobbing young woman in the lobby probably wasn't great for their image.This unpleasant experience left us with a thoroughly poor impression of NYLO - what's the point of even existing as a 4* hotel if you make your guests cry?","London, United Kingdom","talkingbird2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",71,3.0

Booking online through TripAdvisor gave us a better rate than any other booking site. I am very picky about cleanliness, and this hotel was all around clean. I was comfortable in the room, which is an accomplishment for them! I even walked on the floor barefoot, which I almost never do in a hotel (yes, I'm a bit freaky about this).The bedding is all white, which allows them to clean/bleach the light-weight bedspread for each client, and that added to my comfort level.Because we were in town for a visit, we never made use of the outdoor rooftop lounge, or the restaurants/bar but the areas look very pleasant. There is a first floor lounge/library area that is suitable for a relaxing read, as well as a game of chess (provided) or another board/card game.The elevators are fast, the check-in staff were efficient and the bellmen were all extremely friendly and helpful (not typical for NYC service!).We were on the 77th Street side, and either the building under construction across the street, or the fire dept. across the street were doing some kind of work at about 3 AM both nights, which was rather noisy.

Ac didn't work, tv wasn't working and it took the staff a while to resolve the situation. They did eventually move her but it ruined her restful night at a hotel! When I called in the morning the manager had already been apprised of the situation and offered us money back. I explained that it wasn't about the money rather it was about wanting to give my daughter a relaxing night at a hotel. She asked me what we wanted and when I told her we wanted her to have that night without any hesitation she booked her into her same room for another night. Coming from the midwest I can say that we don't alway get midwest service in NYC . The NYLO was the exception. That is excellent customer service. We will definitely be staying at the NYLO again in the future.","Evanston, Illinois","Kevin K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Evanston, Illinois</strong>",10,5.0

There was no literature in the room to explain the hotel amenities (which floor for ice/vending, info on the rooftop bar or hotel restaurant/room service). Calls to guest service were always graciously answered but having this info in the room would be helpful. Finally they are charging $14/day for in-room wifi.

Location is fantastic right between two subway stops and not too far away from central park, and after a few days in midtown it was great to be up on the upper west side. Many restaurants, bars, delis, and fashion stores nearby but still maintaining a more local feel than the more touristic areas. The general look of the hotel is very sophisticated and funky. This wears well in the main areas but the rooms are starting to be a little worn. That said it was a comfortable size, clean bathroom, and amazingly comfortable and huge bed! When you visit NYC I think your expectations of room size are quite low but it was much more spacious than I expected. There is a bar downstairs and a library area with two computers and a printer, not very well known (even by the staff member I asked!) there is a public rooftop area, it's more of a balcony though, not overly busy and I found it a nice place to have breakfast and overlook the west side. Unfortunately the staff come across as very flat and deflated and generally melancholy which is a bit of a downer when you are on holidays. You will struggle to get into your room prior to the 4pm check out time as it seems they struggle to turn over the rooms in time, however they will be knocking on your door right on check out time hoping to rush you along. The housekeeping lady was very polite though when I told her I was just scrambling to finish my packing and would be out in a couple of minutes. I tried asking concierge about an airport transfer and she was super disinterested. All that aside I'd be happy to stay there again, if the staff were a little more engaged it would have been an amazing stay.","Sydney, Australia","krugs2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",7,4.0

If you book at the right time, prices can definitely be reasonable. But look out because at least online, I've seen the same room at $600 and &275. Th place is pretty awful top to bottom. They've been renovating for what seems like years, but the rooms are still, at least for me, poorly designed and aesthetically displeasing. It's this new boutique flavor I like to cal ""jail cell chic."" Everything is metal, cold.. The layout in the rooms I've been in can go from annoying to absurd - in this last one the bathroom was so small that I had to close the door in order to use the toilet or the shower. And that was in the room which on their website is priced just below a suite.Those complaints aside, the customer service is dismal. Nobody seems like they like their job..or people in general. I got there super late after a cross-country flight wanting only to take a shower and get to bed. The bad surprise was that my room had no hot water or a shower drain that worked. I called the front desk, and without an apology or an offer to move me, they said no engineers would be there till morning. So much for a shower. The next day someone did come to fix it, did something and left. Hot water appeared after 10 minutes of continuous running and the drain still didn't work. I took a hostel shower (washcloths over the sink) and got to work, seething. Upon checkout I told them how unsatisfied I was. Again, no apology just a generic business card and a promise that they would adjust the rate by some unspecified amount.

In the heart of Upper West Side, close to commerce and two subways stations. For instance, nearby you find pharmacy, a little market, coffee shops, two great cosmetic stores and more. And within a residential area, which made a ruge different in our trip - to be among newyorkers, not only tourists, as us! The style of the lobby is very beautiful, a kind of techo industrial thing full of personality. They have concierge and service reasonable. No luxury at all, only the basic. About the accommodations. Ours was one of the biggest of the entire hotel, so lucky!! It was stylish, but not so beautifully as the lobby, of course. We had many furniture to set our stuff. The beds were very soft (more than I like, in fact). The bathroom had no appropriate furniture and no hooks to hang clothes and towels. Definitely they should invest on it!The restaurant is very good, but I truly don't recommend you to buy the breakfast in advance. Because usually the hotel sells one specific kind of meal and it's almost impossible to eat something different from this rigid menu. Only eggs (you gotta pay extra to add cheese...), or ricotta lemon candied pancakes (fantastic!) or salmon. Everything is delicious, but if you are planning to stay more than four, five days, it's boring. Unless you don't mind eating the same food most part of the days, that's okay. But if you can afford ( cause it's more expensive), buy the meals each day!",,feanders2019,34,4.0

They also have cubicles under the drawers to store items. They will give you a fridge if you request it. The only bad thing I could say about this room si that there are not enough electrical outlets. Have to unplug different items to use the outlets. They provide bottled water when you check in but do not replenish it. The rooms have a safe and a coffee maker.There is a desk in the room but there is no outlet near it. The bathrooms are nice and spacious and shower is strong. Towels are also soft and good quality. They give you amenities but no cotton or q-tips. My sister did not like that they only had plastic cups in the bathroom. There are plenty of space in the bathroom in the shelves to put your items and thought this was a great feature.

When I made the reservations, I asked the desk to give us a nice, superior room with a view. They said they would put it in the notes on our reservation. When we arrived, we were given a room facing a brick wall in the center of the NYLO. I went right back down to the front desk and the rude person at the front desk gave us another room ""with a view"" facing 77th street and charged us an additional per night fee. When we went to that room, it was shocking. The room WAS facing 77th street but because of construction going on, there was a large wooden structure built outside the window surrounded by a three foot wooden wall blocking any view of the street. On this wooden structure right outside our window, we saw garbage and an old discarded christmas tree (it was now July) lying on the structure. When we called down to the front desk and told them there was NO view and we were paying extra for this room, the front desk insisted that we were facing 77th street. We invited them up to look at what we were seeing outside the window, the gentleman said, ""I will tour the rooms when my boss TELLS me to tour the rooms."" We went back down to the front desk and asked for the manager who FINALLY gave us a room with a view (even though the original person said there were no rooms available). just a side note, we also had to call housekeeping because we had no shampoo in our room.

It was an off-street room on the 4th floor. No view out the windows except the wall of the next building 12 feet away, but at least they were in the process of painting the building wall a sunny color, and there was some natural light.Quietest room I've had in NYC. We slept until 10:00AM in almost absolute quiet. No outside noise, no plumbing noise, absolute minimal HVAC noise, it was wonderful! The fact that it was 4th of July weekend may have had something to do with the quiet, as NYC's perpetual construction/maintenance may have been on pause for the weekend.Off-street rooms probably aren't good for claustrophobes, btw. And although construction and/or painting next door may have been an excuse, the windows were filthy. The windows could probably use some sheer drapes to let light in and block some of the ugly. Don't recall if they had them. Room furnishings go back maybe 10 years to On The Ave in the 00s, but the beds are comfortable and bathrooms are nice.

My partner and I have stayed in many hotels in NYC over the past decade and NYLO was by far the best.

As we were staying 14 nights we asked the person at the front desk if anything could be done. She immediately allocated us another room and we were moved the same day. The new room was wonderful, bigger and lighter, and overlooked Broadway. Nothing was too much trouble for the (without exception) pleasant and friendly staff. Checking out was as easy as possible. Storing our luggage was no problem and a cab was called for us. There is a nice bar downstairs, and a lovely space on the roof (no bar), for chilling out. We ate at Serafina once and had a nice (though expensive) experience. The food is lovely. NYLO is brilliantly situated on the Upper West Side, a stone's throw from the Hudson River, and close to 72nd and 79th subway stations, as well as the cross-town buses on 72nd and 79th street.There are cheaper places to eat which are good, such as Chipotle Mexican Grill up on Broadway and 80th.

And not to be overstated was the bed. It is really comfortable! Linens and towels were of high quality, too.The people are amazing! My favorite NYLO employee is Gregory who met us at the door. He was SO helpful and kindhearted. But everyone I met was super friendly!The hotel is pretty reasonably priced. I found the best quotes using their app. The app beat NYLO’s website price- not by much- but it did.Location! NYLO is two blocks from the subway and near a myriad of restaurants. You’re within walking distance of Central Park, the Natural History Museum, and the Met. I felt like the hotel was super quiet on our floor. I never heard my neighbors. I was on the 7th floor and had a quiet stay without any trouble.When I completed my reservations, I took advantage of the “internet package”, however, I never received internet service, except when in the lobby where it’s free for everyone. I have a feeling this is due to my company’s payment being put on hold. Plus, even if I’d had internet service, the information from the hotel states that service is only available for one device. I had also asked for a mini-fridge when I booked, but that didn’t happen. However, I happened to pass someone in the elevator, delivering a mini-fridge to someone else & he was happy to deliver one to my room. Keep in mind if your company is paying for part or all of your hotel stay with a check, your company’s check has to be received 2-3 weeks before you arrive. Things were worked out via credit card and the manager upgraded the room for the confusion, which was really great. What’s a bit confusing is the hotel doesn’t have any information in the rooms about the hotel itself. What floor is the patio on? Where’s the ice machine? What’s on the roof? How the heck are you supposed to know that unless there is some brochure in the room? Overall, I LOVED NYLO and would definitely stay there again!

NYLO is very easy to reach as there are two subway stations close by -- one on 72nd (the 1,2 and 3 lines) and another one on 79th street (the 1 line). The basic rooms are modern but small. However, this probably applies to most NYC hotels. Most importantly, NYLO NYC is clean!One minor downside is that you have to pay for the in-room Wifi. (I think it was around 18 dollars a day which is pretty much equal to stealing -- NYLO, you gotta change this and make the in-room Wifi free.) On the positive side, there are two guest PCs available in the lobby and free Wifi.There are lots of restaurants, grocery stores and small shops in the area. West Side Market on Broadway close to the hotel is highly recommended (although the cashiers might be a bit grumpy at times). Also, walk a few blocks to 83rd and Broadway and have a breakfast or lunch at Artie's Deli (check their website). There's also a 24-hour CVS (pharmacy/supermarket) just across the street from the hotel, so you can easily get some light snacks to eat in your room.Finally, I didn't really need the concierge or any help from the staff. However, everyone seemed nice and friendly enough, and for instance check in was fast and effortless. I actually arrived an hour before the check in time (which is at 4 pm) but got a room immediately. Also, whenever I emailed the hotel before my trip, I always got a quick reply.In short: NYLO NYC is highly recommended.","Helsinki, Finland","hamppu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Helsinki, Finland</strong>",14,4.0

It also about a 20 minute journey via the subway to the main downtown attractions using the No1 train from the 79th station. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance with quality and prices typical for the USA. The best value for money and quality that we found was at T'he Cottage Chinese Restaurant' which is a 1 min walk away.Overall like most hotels in New York that are classified in this star range, it is quite expensive per night for what is on offer and for the amount of time that you actually spend in the room. However the rooms are clean and basic, beds comfortable, it has a good bar with a laid back attitude and with prices similar to the local restaurants and bar/pub prices and the breakfast is good in the connecting restaurant. The gym is basic but adequate. Wifi is free in the lobby but comes at a cost if wishing to use in the rooms; however we got free wifi as a goodwill gesture. Overall customer Service is good for the States & the concierge was particularly helpful throughout our stay.

By the time we got there, I had forgotten that our stay included internet. Of course, the person checking us in(unsmiling and very unwelcoming, I must add) did not remind us of this and as a result we had no internet during the first 3 days of our 5 day stay. On the 4th day, I needed to check something about our room rate so I pulled up the email. This is when I saw that we had an Internet package. We called reception and spoke to someone called Joanna about this who apologised and immediately offered to refund the amount included for Internet for all days of our stay and gave us free access for the remaining two days(I did not ask for this - only for a refund for the days not used).Later we received a call from one of their front office managers called Matt who point blank refused to refund the amount. He said we must have 'misunderstood' when the check in clerk was giving us the login details. When we told him there was no mention of the Internet package at the time of check in he raised his voice, started screaming, told us to go find another hotel and threatened to hang up. He refused to give us his last name. Very, very unpleasant!Thankfully, the next day, I spoke to Renata, the operations manager. She was very reasonable and promised to take care of the situation which she did by taking off the amount charged for Internet from our bill.We stayed in 917.

Last visit I stayed nearer the ""touristy"" stuff..times square etc. Big mistake. I decided to try a place closer to my sons home on the upper west side. Nylo is away from the crowds and craziness..but still within walking distance of fantastic dining, shopping, parks etc. And only a quick walk to the subway to get everywhere else! I was greeted by the nicest doorman I have ever encountered...travelling alone can be a little scary (at least for me:)..and I immediately felt at ease and welcomed at NYLO! Check in took about 5 minutes tops. The vibe in the lobby is relaxed and cool...feels like an old timey bar/lounge. Plenty of seating areas and the little lobby bar is fantastic...I got a glass of wine later in the evening and just sat and watched people..so comfy! I had a room on the 7th floor (701). If you are looking for a view..this room would not have pleased you. My view was a tall bring wall. Fortunately, a view isnt a big deal for me at all..I'm just there to sleep! But, if you want a view...head up to the 16th floor terrace!! Amazing!!! Take a drink and sit there all evening..so relaxing!! Because my room was in the back of the hotel it was insanely quiet, other than occasional door slams from neighbors. The room was spotless. My first time in a hotel with wood floors..and I love it! So much cleaner than carpet!! In room keurig coffee and complimentary bottled water. Yes please!! The bed was by far the best hotel bed I've ever slept in..fluffy bedding, tons of pillows...ahhh!!! The bathroom was much bigger than the last nyc hotel i stayed in. Big walk in shower, great water pressure and immediate hot water. Only tiny negative was the lack of towel bars, or hooks..would be nice to have a spot to hang your robe etc. The housekeepers are like ninjas! We were literally gone 45 minutes to grab some breakfast one morning and came back to spotless room. Never even SAW the housekeeping staff!! I checked out at 6:15 Monday morning for an early flight back to Michigan. Took two seconds. He even called out to the doorman to start finding me a cab. 5 stars nylo..you are fantastic!!","Zeeland, Michigan","jill c</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Zeeland, Michigan</strong>",1,5.0

Convenient to many sights: Times Square, Broadway, Central Park, Rockerfeller Center, Museums (The Met, MoMA, Natural History to name a few). Not convenient to the south end of the island (SoHo, East / West village, China Town, Little Italy, Wall Street, Brooklyn). However if you are willing to take the subway (call it a 'train' and sound like a local) you can get anywhere on the island safely and easily from here. No hotel is 'close to everything,' despite what you may read online. The island is 9 miles long and about 3 miles wide. You can't expect to be close to all things no matter where you stay. The rooms are comfortable with nice bath amenities and good TVs but otherwise pretty spartan. The beds are very comfortable. The lobby bar is excellent! Great drinks and atmosphere. (Very NYC). If you want to see the City stay here. If you want a resort with a gym and pool, stay elsewhere. There is a concierge in the lobby, which is nice, but it is really more for tourist info than for scoring hard to get tickets or reservations. The front desk staff is usually over worked and they can be brusque if there is a line. Which is understandable. What isn't understandable is why there is a line so often. If you stay here try a meal at Cafe Piccolo which is on Amsterdam between 74 and 75. About 3 blocks away. Very small and very good, without being very expensive. Also nearby is the 79th street Boat Basin, which is where Will Smith and Eva Mendes get the jet skis in the movie Hitch.

Not far from the park and close to the Museum. It has a very neat ""vibe"" - very unique. The lobby and bar are fun. They give off an underground club feel. The room was small (king bed) but that is not unusual for NYC hotels. Dressers have a neat trendy look but are not at all practical - no drawers, only shelves and cupboards. We couldnt get the AC cool enough the first eve - we set the thermostat at 64 and the room wouldnt cool below 69. Hotel would be average for the experience however we had no hot water both mornings. We advised the front desk on the first morning. We were pushed for time and couldn't wait so we had to settle with cool showers. The staff said they would send someone up. We had hot water that evening but woke the next morning again to no hot water. It became obvious to us that this has happened before and there is clearly a problem with the hotel. Our room was over 700 for two nights and they only discounted our bill $100 for the water problem. We think they could have done better than that. It's an upscale NYC hotel.

We were really impressed with the hotel and it was perfect for us. It is located 2 blocks from the subway which takes about 15 mins max to get to Times Square, or you could walk to a subway station a little further which has a faster train. The neighbourhood nearby was lovely and we preferred this to staying in the very centre of town - it had a more residential, relaxed feel and we felt at home there. It's close to some great restaurants and opposite a 24 hour supermarket/pharmacy which was great. The hotel itself is very clean and smart looking. The bar in the lobby looked great but we didn't actually use it during our stay. We saw other people taking drinks from there up to the lounge area on the balcony which sounded great, we just didn't have a chance to do it! Compared to other hotels it was possibly a little less welcoming - we were very much left to ourselves which was fine, but there was not quite the level of service I have experienced in other American hotels. The lack of a mini bar and/or room service was a little disappointing but as there is so much nearby this wasn't really a problem.We essentially just used this hotel as a place to sleep as there was so much to do in the city! And for that, it was perfect as the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! The room was also decorated really nicely and kept very clean. Our coffee and water supplies were not regularly topped up, but again this didn't matter as we were out for breakfast every morning.There were some building works going on on 77th Street (which look quite long term). It wasn't a huge problem but they did start at around 8am every day and were quite noisy at times, so a room on the other side of the hotel may be quieter.I would definitely recommend this hotel to others staying in NYC as a great base, and it was great value for money compared to some of the other hotels we looked at.

Or it might just be the price point. $300 plus/night might just not be enough in NYC for a memorable boutique experience. Maybe $400 gets you there. Was it a bad stay? No. Would I stay there again? No. ",,771michaelm771,60,3.0

I had expected to receive the same superior service I received when I visited last year, but sadly, this year was much different. We flew in on the red eye flight (because I don't believe in losing a day to travel) and arrived at the hotel at 6am. I had called this night before to ask for an early check in, and although I knew there was no guarantee, I was hopeful. We were told the room wasn't yet available, but they would get us in as soon as they could and in fact confirmed my phone number, so that they could call me as soon as it was ready. Perhaps we misunderstood, but that made me feel as though we would be able to check in sooner than the 3pm check in time they told us. So we walked in the park a little, grabbed breakfast. We came back to check on the status of the room, and when my brother went up to the desk, he was brushed aside by the staff, telling him, ""we have you right here and will let you know"" without asking his name. (Keep in mind it was different staff at the desk than when we arrived at 6am). We were told again that they were trying to get us in before 3pm. We left and tried to make the most of the day despite our exhaustion from overnight travel. Came back around 230, hoping for a miracle of the room being ready. Was told the good news was that the room was vacant (no kidding, check out was at 11am, the room better be vacant) and that they were still cleaning, but to come back at 3pm. 3pm finally comes around, and there's new staff at the front desk again, surprise, who tells me that check in is actually 4pm and they are just starting to clean our room. I asked to speak with a manager because we didn't understand why we were told 3pm all day and brushed off every time we spoke with someone at the desk. We were told the manager would call our room when we got there. I would have preferred to speak with him in person, but apparently that was asking too much. When they finally get us in our room at 4, we are appalled to see that the floors were filthy, there was still soap scum in the shower, crumbs all over the furniture and chewed gum on the floor by the door. We had been waiting for someone to clean our room but apparently the only thing they did was change the towels and linens. I walked downstairs to the front desk and spoke with yet another person about the cleanliness of the room. At least this person was responsive and immediately sent housekeeping back up to our room.

My recent visit was a total disaster! My advice to fellow travellers is to find another hotel in this area. Do not ruin your vacation by staying here!My room - I had stayed at this hotel several times before so I knew that when I requested a quiet room, away from elevators and not on Broadway Street, I would get a great room. Upon check in, we were given a room right on the corner of Broadway and 77th Street. Needless to say, it was constant noise all night. At 5:30 AM, after a very noisy night, the night front desk clerk assured us that the hotel would be delighted to move us to a quiet room. This did not happen. We were never moved. We were offered a different type of room (at an extra cost) facing the inner courtyard. Upon inspection, we noticed that the room vibrated and hummed because the courtyard was filled with air-conditioning machinery. We were also offered a room few floors up but still right on Broadway and 77th. No other rooms were available as the hotel was full. Getting a good night's sleep at this hotel is impossible because there is construction on 77th street, more construction behind the hotel and there is construction inside the hotel. Do not stay here if you plan on sleeping!Housekeeping - Abysmal is the best way to describe it. The sheets did not fit the King size bed - they were too short and not wide enough. We asked for the right size sheets and only on our last night (out of 5 nights) did they put the proper size sheets. Surprise! They do have them but it takes many requests!One night, after a long day of being out, we came back and there were no towels! After 5 requests to the front desk clerk and to the on duty manager and 2 hours of our time, we finally got the full compliment of towels. How can you do up a room and forget ALL the towels? How hard is it to fulfil this request?The pillows on the bed are small. They are 6"" smaller than a twin bed pillow. They arrange a good number of these pillows on the bed making it look plushy but, in the end, they are small uncomfortable pillows! When we requested king size pillows, we were told that all the pillows are the same size.Mechanical - One morning we noticed that the air conditioning was blowing hot air. At 10 AM we told the front desk. When we returned at 8 PM, the room was extremely hot! Back to the front desk where they claimed nobody ever put in a request to Maintenance. Luckily the Maintenance men came right away. We were told to come back in 1.5 hours so that they could fix it properly. Why could they not fix this during the day? After a full day in NY, the last thing we wanted was to be out of our room!The hot water in the sink was terrible. The water flow from the hot side was just a dribble and, after running this dribble for 20 minutes or more, the water would be tepid. Most of the time, the ""hot"" water dribble was cold. Saving money or just being a cheap hotel?Staff - Words that describe this staff - terrible, surly, non attentive, not helpful, if possible, no eye contact, no smiles, no ""what can we do to make your stay better?"", no follow through on requests (towels, room change, air conditioner, sheets, hot water), lots of looking at the computer as we tried to tell them about (another) problem. They don't wear name tags or introduce themselves. All the staff, from the front desk to the managers, were the worst in all my travels. Booking Ahead - one word - DON'T! I booked online to get a good rate as I knew the NYLO was a great place to stay. But this was not in our favour! Once we paid, we could not get a refund and we were stuck in this hotel. If I had only booked a reservation, I would have moved after the first night. Boutique Hotel? - NO! It is a substandard hotel trying to be a boutique hotel. Plastic cups in the bathroom, Kleenex that is thin and scratchy, thin rough toilet paper, maids carts left in the hallway overnight, surly staff, short sheets, poor maintenance, dirty hallway rugs and this list goes on..... After this terrible stay, the manager on duty was so ""gracious"" to reimburse us for one night's stay. Seriously?This being New York, there are many other hotels in the area that have great reviews. This being New York, people will continue to come here and be disappointed! Don't be one of them.","Vancouver, Canada","westeddy54</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",146,1.0

The front desk was helpful if constrained by the mistake. The new room we were reassigned was facing a wall - this room assignment was unbelievable.

Same drill as the last stay a few months ago. Front desk is just rude, management is the same. I requested a quiet room, so was given something that looked out onto a brick wall - no daylight whatsoever. Wouldn't have been a problem if it were not for the fact that the alley acted as an echo chamber for some construction vehicle. When I asked to change rooms because of the noise, I was interrogated with incredibility. The change occurred, but even simple requests of the front desk were met with disdain. It appears to be limited to the morning shift and the desk manager. But as I said in a prior review, it has become a deeper problem. Simple requests that would be routine at a quality establishment are dismissed out of hand. Use only as a fallback (with graduation week many hotels were fully booked) - there are many other hotels in the city that will actually extend themselves to provide a quality experience.","Concord, Massachusetts","DavidM2013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Concord, Massachusetts</strong>",31,2.0

The Nylo was in the perfect location for doing both! Seriously, the Nylo is truly close to everything (or just a short subway, taxi, or Uber ride away). The lobby of the hotel is great, filled with cushy couches, a room with computers and tables with comfortable chairs, and a bar. We had a fairly large queen-queen suite room, with two beds (although I don't think they were queen sized), a desk with chair, and a small couch. The bathroom was huge with a wonderful sink and a great shower. Even though our room faced the street, it was, by New York standards, fairly quiet. My only complaint is about the cleanliness of the floors in both our room and in our bathroom. I had to pick up several strands of long hair (definitely not ours) and a fair number of plastic pieces cut off from clothing tags. I found having to do that rather unpleasant and should not have been necessary.

I preferred neighborhood to just about any other neighborhood I went into. Great shops ,street vendors,restaurants and bars. It was for the most part clean and housekeeping came every day and did their thing accordingly. With fantastic views on the upper floors of the Upper West Side and the Hudson River.The bar downstairs was adequate. Bartenders were great.The staff was also nice and accommodating.Good windows that filter out street traffic.And here's a big one ...probably one of the best Hotel Beds I've ever slept on. Fantastic beds and bedding!!! Nelson a hotel driver is awesome, is a local, and has a lot of info on the area. Don't be afraid to use the car service once you're at the hotel; it cost about the same as a taxi but is a lot cleaner and a little faster.Cons: There is no room service!!! None...Elevators are slow.The breakfast package is only for a small part of the menu downstairs at sarafina's. So if you do not like the those items you have to pay for any other items. If you eat a healthy breakfast, then yogurt and berries is all you can really get with the breakfast package. They don't serve oatmeal. Breakfast is only served until 11a in the morning. If you plan to sleep in don't get the package. Your wasting money.The doors on the rooms are thin and you can hear everything down the hallway. The windows however are good and you cannot hear street traffic hardly at all.I spent 5 days there an average of $400+ a night, for a room with a tiny terrace. Prior to my stay wrote the hotel about my birthday an anniversary on a particular day...not even so much as a chocolate on the pillow. Let alone mimosas. So, in my opinion definitely missing the little warm fuzzies that other 4 star hotels I've stayed at have. Also I don't know how the hotel gets four stars it does not have a salon Spa or room service.!!!! Other than that, it was a good place in a great area!!! With great beds!!!",,Rmn515,14,3.0

The hotel was in a great location on the upper west side. Approximately a 25 minute walk to Times Square and only a couple of blocks to a subway station. Our room on the 8th floor was gorgeous and I have to say that the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! We had a window, however, it looked out onto a concrete wall, although we only slept in the hotel and spent very little time in it, due to being out and about exploring so much, so having a view didn't really matter to us. The hotel itself was modern with an industrial feel to it and in excellent condition. However, unfortunately there were a number of small issues which resulted in us being a little disappointed with our stay. On our first morning we woke up very early due to the time difference/jetlag so we got up to get in the shower around 6am, aiming to get out for an early walk and breakfast. The hot water was not switched on, so we had to delay leaving the hotel. This happened daily. Equally, in the evenings we wouldn't get back to the hotel until gone 11pm (one night it was gone midnight) and If we wanted a shower or even a wash in the sink we weren't able to have one, as the hot water had been switched off. Secondly the hotel staff weren't too friendly. As mentioned we didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel but whenever we did ask the staff a question they weren't very helpful and seemed too busy to help. We experienced fantastic customer service whilst in New York in restaurants etc. But unfortunately our hotel did not match this. Sometimes the reception area smelt like drains too.When booking the NYLO hotel with Expedia, we weren't made aware at the point of booking that there was a skyscraper being built opposite the hotel. The sound of jackhammers began at 7am so if people are looking to spend quite a lot of time in the hotel and want to sleep in in the morning this is not the hotel for you. There was a note in our room on arrival apologising for the inconvenience but this was the first we heard of it. Most of these issues I have mentioned didn't really bother us too much due to the fact that we only used the hotel as a base. It was great for that and purely on that basis we would definitely stay again.

There was construction going on the floor I was staying on, a bit noisy but not terrible. There were no instructions or maps in the room for dining or even the ice machine, I still have no idea where it was. The view was of a wall, now that is not a big deal for me you can always pay more for a view if you really want one. The bed was comfortable but the mattress kept sliding off the foundation. WIFI is extra which in this day and age I think is ridiculous.On the positive side:The room was clean and bug freethe bar in lobby is nice and there is lots of lounge type seating which almost makes up for there being no comfortable seating in the room.

In our extensive travel experience, hotels typically have rooms ready to greet guests at 3 pm - which comes in particularly handy when you've had an early morning flight and have been on your feet walking all day! Despite asking politely at 9:50 in the morning if our room could possible be ready for 3 - the desk staff were adamant about 4 pm. It was the only service I'd recommend to the staff to re-think.

The interior is decorated well and the two restaurants are convenient and the bar made good and unique drinks. However, I felt the staff was a bit stiff. We were there with our 12 year old daughter and no one ever greeted her. Also our first room didn't match what I had booked and we were told, ""Well you pre-paid so this is actually fairly good."" I didn't realize paying ahead of time was a penalty nor did I appreciate the attitude that came with it. Also the waitress was unwilling to adjust our order after she placed it as she said it would be too hard to void and re-enter. At Serafina gratuity is included and we felt there was little motivation to provide strong service. That said the rooms were a great size for the city and the terrace was a great place to enjoy the Hudson and views of the Park. I just wish the staff had been friendlier.

It was recommended by Columbia, and I have no idea why. There are better, Columbia-owned places to stay at the same price in Morningside Heights. The two pros of this place are location and price, and I won't argue with those. Also the staff were nice, and the lobby and downstairs bar had a good vibe.But vibe will only take you so far, and ultimately I'd rather have (1) carpet or at least rugs rather than bare flooring, (2) real furniture rather than a cubby made of locker-like metal, (3) a safe in the room, and (4) a mini-fridge that comes standard rather than having to call and ask for one (though they were nice about that). The room felt like a glorified hostel rather than a hotel. I was a mid-career woman at an academic conference who needed to pump and store milk for an infant. This was not the right place for me, and I ended up regretting following Columbia's advice. I would have preferred shelling out a little more for something better. Or, again, staying in Columbia's own housing by the university for the same price.Also, as part of the reservation process I gave my email address, and I have never been spammed so much by a hotel in my life, not even by the major chains.The price and location are right, just know what you are getting (and not getting).",,roly227,2,3.0

The location is very convenient, off Broadway near the 79th Street subway station. The desk clerk who checked me in kindly told me I'd been upgraded to room 1035, a pleasant room on a high floor overlooking Broadway. The clean, quiet room was dominated by the king-size bed, which was made up with good-quality white linens. Not the biggest room, but nicely done in Boutique Hotel decor, and efficient. Afterwards I stopped for a glass of happy hour wine in the stylish lobby, which has lots of cozy seating areas. Post-opera we both enjoyed a good night's sleep and in the morning we picked up awesome French pastries from Maison Kaiser across the street.Pros: Convenient location, quiet, good in-room thermostat controls, comfy pillows and mattress, quiet quick-flush toilet, modern tiled bath with lots of counter space, nice toiletries, ample bedside lighting, plenty of storage and outlets, Keurig coffeemaker, free bottled water, friendly bar area in lobby, nice staff.Cons: Room had just one desk chair plus a little bench for seating, no towel racks in the bathroom, no minibar/fridge in room, annoying live piano music in the lobby late at night, no free coffee in the lobby at breakfast (a standard perk these days), charge for wi-fi.Would I stay here again?

I had stayed here before so was pleasantly surprised to see that nothing had changed over the last year or two. The staff in this hotel are very friendly and make you feel welcome constantly. The lobby/bar areas were always a constantly popular place for folks to congregate as its a warm and inviting spot. Wi-fi is strong here as indeed it is in the rooms. Our's was complimentary as part of the room package. We asked for a twin bed arrangement ans was pleasantly surprised by the size of the room offered. In fact on our last night a third member of our family used the sofa bed. For NY having this amount of size was quite a surprise. The room was keep in great condition and cleaned to a high standard. Very important anywhere but NY has its challenges in keeping up cleanliness but I'm pleased to say that you'll be happy with NYLO's standards. The only reason we didn't rate with 5 stars this time was because across the road and also next to the hotel is a construction site which starts up around 5am. For those first few jet lagged days it was difficult for us light sleepers to get a decent sleep. Also there is a fire station across the road and you had the occasional late night departure with sirens on entering Broadway. So my suggestion is that whilst the construction continues for the next several months by all means stay here BUT ask for a room away from 77th street. If your new to the Upper West Side, this hotel is perfectly located to the 1,2,3 trains at 72nd or 1 train even closer at 79th.

My stay began by pulling up to the hotel and finding nobody at the entrance to help with my luggage nor any luggage carts. In search of a cart, I entered, walking around a bar to the front desk where one woman in particular met my request for a luggage cart with an attitude of contempt. I think she was disgusted that I had somehow failed to follow protocol - she blamed me for not knowing to wait outside with my meter running for someone to return who could help me. The next day, I asked the porter to put my ice packs in a freezer since I needed them to transport my son's medicine the next day. A nice guy, he asked his manager what to do and this is where things went from bad to worse. Right away she starts by telling me it can't be done. Incredulous, I made suggestions which she shot down one by one without so much as contributing one alternative until I pointed this out to her. Then she suggested she would find out where I could buy dry ice - the place she eventually suggested was all the way down in Times Square. The more I thought about it, the more unreasonable it seemed to me that my hotel wasn't taking responsibility for providing a solution given what I was asking for was perfectly reasonable - have they never had guests who travel with insulin?? I went downstairs hoping to find a more helpful individual at the front desk. Instead I was met by the assistant manager who informed me he had ""been told"" about me - wow, that feels really nice and welcoming! He said the best he could do for me would be to keep the medicine in the frig upstairs until 2pm and that even this he wasnt going to do for me because he didnt like my attitude.

The first visit (Feb '15) really ""wowed"" us... cool urban vibe, comfy bed, quiet room, friendly people... could not have been better. We were back this past weekend and while we still enjoyed the hotel, we realized some rooms are definitely better than others. The room we were in this time, 222, was very small compared the room we had last year (supposedly same category/standard king room) You could barely walk around to the far side of the bed. (The bathroom was huge however, a real plus!) There were two issues: The door to the bathroom was made of frosted glass, which looked great, but since it was only about 2 feet from the bed when the bathroom was used in the middle of the night, the bright light flooded the bedroom and woke the second person. Our room last year was more of an L-shape, so the bathroom was around the corner, not making this an issue. (A nightlight or bathroom dimmer is sorely needed) Also, the first morning, my husband got up to shower and came out after about 10 minutes saying there was no hot water. He got dressed and went out to get us coffees (as they only give you ONE pod of regular coffee with the coffeemaker!)... he stopped at the desk to tell them of the lack of hot water, assuming either we'd be moved or a maintenance tech advised. Instead, he was just greeted with a shrug and a ""yeah you have to let the water run for up to 20 minutes for it to get hot"". So for the remainder of our stay, we had to set our alarm for 20 minutes earlier than we needed to be up just to assure we would be able to shower. If this had been my first time at this hotel I would have given it a lower-than-average rating but since our first visit had been so impressive, I am thinking we were just given a dud room. Overall I still like the hotel, but now that I'm aware there are different lay-outs within each room category, I'll be more assertive in asking for one with the L-shape layout so the sleeping area is shielded a bit from the brightly lit bathroom. Also, I'll check the hot water right away so I don't find out at 6 am there is no hot water. Lastly, I'll request a few more pods of regular coffee, so we aren't standing there sharing one cup of coffee again while we wait 20 minutes for the shower to get hot!","Redmond, Washington","821travelman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redmond, Washington</strong>",1,4.0

So I went down and complained to the front desk, and he said I will be given a new room by between 2-4pm that same day, I went down again and I was told that the room won't be available until the next day, same time. Next day came, I came down again and this time a female staff was there. Upon following up my request, she said there was no note left about it but said she will help me. She said to go back to my room and wait for her call. By 2pm she called me and said the room is ready and said I should left the safe open before leaving. So I came down and she gave me a key for room 1225. When I got there, it won't open. So I came down again bringing down all my luggages with me and she apologized, saying it should be for room 1025. I came up again with my luggages in tow and alas, it won't open again! So I came down again together with my luggages and she told me she will send someone to fix the doorlock. After sometime it was finally opened, but my requested refrigerator wasn't there. When I told them about it, after several hours and two follow up calls it finally came.

I was in NYC for business and needed a place that would fulfill my budget, needs, and location, while providing a place I could work in my room. This hotel was more than I expected for NYC hotel in this affordable price range.Pros: - LOCATION! This is in the heart of the best of some of NYC offerings and secrets! Great restaurants, Zabars, great bakeries, shops, museums, and ease of transportation. And a quiet place in residential NYC. - The rooms are very clean, no awful hotel carpeting, clean line furniture. The rooms are small, but designed so there is room to move, work, stretch without bumping into things. Very streamlined.- Great comfortable hotel lobbies! The designs of each lobby room is great- providing two big screen computers with a printer, a table for internet laptops. A bright room for social quiet resting places, and another lobby more intimate for socializing or resting. Great ambience.- Fantastic staff!! - a doorman is always there, friendly and helpful. Luggage storing service, very caring and personable. I felt very comfortable and safe about the care they took with my belongings.- Staff tries very hard to accommodate and will call you if your room is ready before check-in.- Great restaurants by the hotel, and top notch breakfast and Zabars, West Side Market in the neighborhood.- Location is tops. A Staples is a block away, shops if you forgot something. Right on the subway.Cons:The only thing is that the doors tend to slam on their own and can get noisy. The clients in the hotel are very quiet, and the hotel is quiet, except for the closing of room doors.Otherwise- I definitely plan to stay at this hotel again.

My only complaint was the lack of soundproofing between rooms. Our room had a door to our neighbor's room (like many hotels), but there was only ONE door. Light poured in from the other room (lots of gaps around the door), as did the sound. We all got to listen to another family's conversation as clearly as if they were standing right next to our beds. And they weren't speaking loudly at all!I complained to the front desk in the morning, and the manager was sincerely apologetic. But he made it clear that this was an architectural issue and nothing could be done. Our second night, we lucked out with an empty neighboring room.

NYLO's staff is fantastic. From the moment you walk in that door till when you exit - consistent experience every single time.The location is also key for me. It's true Upper West Side...with a 24 hour CVS AND a deli (Europan) right across the street.

Instead they put me in a hotel in Times Square, my least favorite part of New York. Since my meetings were near the NYLO on the upper West Side,?Times Square was very inconvenient. In the hospitality industry this is known as ""walking"" the client but since Times Square was miles away from the upper West side, it was hardly a walk. Checking in the next day I complained and essentially got nowhere. They did say that as partial compensation they were giving me a room on the quiet side of the hotel that did not face construction.

NYLO is 2 blocks away so that was good. The lobby had lots of couches and a cute bar. We got in around 10pm on Friday night. We entered our room on the second floor. Maybe my daughter was used to staying at Kimpton Hotels, but immediately she had a bad feeling about the room. It was very boxy. Comfortable bed but the shower was dirty, the sink had no counter area and there was no mini-bar. I guess I didn't do my homework. I had to order roomservice but that only comes from the Semolina resturant attached to the hotel. And they don't send up a glass of wine. I don't get it.On Saturday before the concert I decided that we would have appetizers in the lobby. We had a full hour before we had to go to the concert. I ordered 2 appeitzers and we just sat there and waited and waited. Meanwhile watching all the other bigger parties of people be served on quickly. Finally I gave up and told the host that we had to leave. She didn't understand that an 8 1/2 year old girl gets hungry and going to a concert like that is not good. I prayed that the theater had food. Dinner was chips, pretzels, popcorn and m&M's. We had to order roomservice again at 11:00pm because my girl was starving for real food. I only stayed here because of the proximity to the Beacon Theatre. I won't stay here again.Only good thing is Semolina's breakfast. Big big breakfasts that satisfy.

For 6 days, every night I was woken up in the middle of the night for different reasons. The most consistent is the noisy AC/Heating Unit. Every time it turns on, it sounds like a lawn mower from the 80s. It's such a loud shocking noise that no matter how hard of a sleeper you are, it will wake you up. Then, one night some of the guests who may have been out partying all night or something came back to their rooms drunk and started slamming their doors. This started some battle between a lady who got upset about them slamming doors and the drunk guests. For hours, back and forth they argued and yelled in the hallway. On two occasions the Hotel staff were notified and came up to intervene. This happened again the next night. I know that the hotel business is tough and sometimes you cannot prevent trailer trash from staying in your hotel, but if you intervene more than once with a disturbance like this you should kick them out plain and simple. The staff were also sometimes very dismissive and rushy when I complained about the AC/Heating Unit they quickly cut me off and said ""sir all of our rooms are the same, anything else we can help you with?"" - so dismissive and so disappointing. Also, staying here for 6 days I bumped into many hotel staff and not one person once ever asked me ""How is your stay with us?"" or ""I hope you are enjoying your stay with us."" Even when I checked out, the lady at the front desk did not ask ""how was your stay with us?"" and Guess what, if she did I probably wouldn't be writing this review now. On the plus side, the hotel is in a great area (but next time I'll stay at the Hotel Belleclaire) and the restaurant Red Farm is excellent, plus the rooms are clean and the bed is super comfy (which I guess doesn't matter if there's constant noise preventing you from enjoying the bed.)

The room (a Deluxe Queen Queen) was surprisingly large - with space on both sides of both beds and a sitting area (oddly configured L-shaped room). Beds were high and comfortable. Furnishings were low-end modern (think IKEA) and definitely gave a loft style to the rooms (different but very appropriate for NYC). We liked the wood floors, but some guests may prefer carpeting. The heating system was very loud and had great difficulty keeping the room at a constant temperature (we were alternately too warm or chilly) so it cycled on and off all night (keeping some of us awake). Great number of outlets, including some USB chargers - so the kids could keep all their devices charged - and the wireless internet speed was acceptable (should be included free in all room packages). When we extended our stay we we were not given the same rate or package - but told we could look up other options online, which was frustrating (and staff was a bit aloof/rude). Bathroom was reasonably sized with large shower (no tub). There were no terry cloth bathrobes as listed not the website, and arrangement of towels/hooks caused our towels (we used 4) to stay a bit wet overnight. Not sure the rooms were very cleaned each day - the beds were made and trash emptied, but sink seemed unwashed and ""hello"" written in fog on the shower door by previous occupants was still there when we left. (Although the room was not noticeably dirty). The ""complimentary water"" was two bottles at room temperature. Lack of an in-room refrigerator was a disappointment (no left overs or cool drinks). It was not at all clear where to find an ice machine (12th floor), as the halls are a bit of a maze and there is no information in the room about hotel services or amenities. Breakfast at the attached Serafina's restaurant was expensive but good (lemon ricotta pancakes, yum), but we were frustrated when asked if the hotel gave us ""vouchers"", which they did not (again, different packages provide different options - and it was all too confusing). Unlike other visitors, we did not have issues with street noise (there is construction directly across 77th street), but that was due to the fact that our room's 4 windows overlooked a brick wall! It was a bit disorienting, as we got practically NO evidence of daylight. The location was great - within walking distance of central park west side museums and such and only 2 blocks from subway.

We had stayed on the Upper West Side (UWS) once before in another nearby location and found the NYLO to be a much more pleasant experience. The location is an ideal base from which to take advantage of all that NYC has to offer. The UWS has a very quiet, laid-back and friendly neighbourhood feel about it, yet it is still only one subway stop from Times Square on the #2 or #3 Express train from the 72nd St station. The #1 Broadway local train from 79th street runs the entire length of Manhattan from the southern tip of the island, and to the north up into the Bronx. Using either of these you are able to connect with the vast network that is the MTA which puts all of New York just steps from the hotel. We arrived at the hotel well in advance of the posted check-in time with a view to dropping our bags and returning to complete the check-in later in the day. Much to our surprise we were told that our room was ready we enjoyed a smooth check-in and access to the room right away. The room itself was spacious and clean with a three piece bathroom that contained a shower with the best water pressure that I have ever experienced in any hotel, anywhere. The lack of a bathtub was not an issue for us, but I would advise that if this is a potential deal-breaker to confirm in advance whether there are any rooms where a bathtub is available. The furnishings and fittings in the room were of an industrial-chic design, very minimalist, but serviceable and above all clean. We also found the bed to be comfortable with good quality sheets, pillows and comforter. The room did not have a refrigerator when we arrived, but one was cheerfully provided within hours of our request. Check-out was a seamless as when we checked-in, and the front desk staff graciously offered to store our bags for us without being asked. This was not something that we required as we were flying out within a few hours, but if one were to have a flight much later in the day it would be a useful option. There is an on-site restaurant as well as a very comfortable lobby bar and business centre, none of which we got to fully enjoy given the busy schedule we had planned in advance.  Based on this initial experience at the NYLO we would not hesitate to return, and would be pleased to recommend this hotel to anyone seeking accommodation on the UWS.","Toronto, Canada","M M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",7,5.0

Upon check in, we were given the option to choose a ""slightly larger"" room with 2 beds rather than a queen bed room. This room was on a higher floor so I asked about the construction across the street. We were told there would be no construction during our stay. Of course, we woke up to construction right outside our window the morning after Valentine's Day. Rooms were ultimately trendy and comfortable but cramped. The restaurant at the hotel was average. Hostess was wonderful- she moved our table when she saw how cold the front of the restaurant was getting due to the frigid temperatures. Wait staff was terrible. Gave us the check before we even finished the entree. We still wanted to order dessert it was Valentine's Day after all.Convenient location. Close to Subway stop and CVS directly across the street. They gave out complimentary roses on Valentine's Day which was a nice touch. They ran out quickly though.Check out was the worst part of our stay. I politely asked for a printed receipt and the front desk agent told me to request one from my booking website. I asked to please print me a receipt for my records so that I could see a zero balance for my stay. He refused. I was forced to call my credit card company to make sure there were no additional charges. Concierge was just as bad. We asked them if there were any diners in the area for breakfast. They told us that there were unfortunately no diners in that luckily. Funny enough there were two very crowded diner 2 blocks away.Overall, great location with sub-par service.

On the upside: VERY well located. The immediate neighborhood has lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. It's also walking distance to the Museum of Natural History. If you want to go somewhere farther off, the 1 train is just two short blocks from Nylo. And of course you can transfer at 42nd street to a number of other trains, taking you all over the city--other parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. The room was quite clean and it was not noisy at all. There was also a bar in the lobby quite a bit of comfortable seating, as well as a long table where you can plug in your computer and work.The downside: The room itself was *tiny*. I think they might try having a queen size bed instead of a king size one. As it was, the king size bed took up 80 of the room--seriously, it really did! There was not a lot of room to move around. Also, the bathroom had a frosted glass door through which you could clearly see whoever was inside. :-(That said, I think this hotel is fine for people who are just going to shower and sleep there.

Our room was ready when we got there but when we got to the room, it was horrible and dark. The windows faced the center of the building so all you could see was a brick wall. The room was small, dark and depressing so we went back to the front desk to ask for a new room. The person behind the counter pretended not to understand why we would want to switch rooms and I didn't like his attitude, but finally said he would give us a new room but it would be noisier because of construction outside on that side of the hotel. We didn't care; we'd rather have the noise and the light and the view than to spend our weekend in a dungeon like room. We had to wait almost 2 hours to get the new room. We were very happy with the switch. There really wasn't much noise from the construction and the room was bright and airy. Great to have a coffee pot in the room for morning coffee if you didn't want to go down the block to starbucks first thing. The bathroom was sufficient. Would love to have robes in the room but that would be a perk. The thermostat in the room wasn't working (flashing low battery) but was quickly fixed when we told the front desk.

Not really.See text copied from website: Trendsetting On-Site DiningNYLO New York City features 3 on-site restaurants and bars.They offered me plastic silverware. And were extremely condescending when i said that I couldn't cut an apple with that and how was it possible that they had no silverware. I went to the adjacent, off the lobby, restaurant to ask for a knife, and was refused, told, ""we are not connected with the hotel.""So, not only does the website misrepresent what ""services"" they offer. They need to think about items guests would want that are normal and customary for a 4-star hotel.I suggest the hotel purchase some inexpensive silverware to offer other guests who may want it. It's not uncommon, at all, for tourists, especially when surrounded by the plethora of great gourmet markets in the area, to buy cheese, bread,fruit, snacks and want to be able eat it in a civilized manner.

There is construction happening across the road from the hotel which starts at 7am on the dot Monday to Friday. We were placed on the second floor, right across from the construction, and it honestly was so loud that it felt like there was a jackhammer in our room with us. Even without the construction, the windows don't seem to be sound proofed as the noise of taxis honking all night carried right into our room. I'm normally a heavy sleeper however we didn't get much sleep in this hotel.I feel like this hotel has the potential to be really great, however no one from the reception mentioned any of the facilities when we checked in, so it was up to us to 'find' all of the amenities such as the surprise rooftop which we were not aware of.If we went back to New York, we would likely try another hotel given how much we paid and the level of hotel competition.","Melbourne, Australia","pepsi104</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",6,3.0

It was a gorgeous view!! Being on an upper floor blocked out all the road noise but it unfortunately did not block out the noise of the inconsiderate floor-mates who found it necessary to repeatedly slam their room door every time they went in or out of the room. Seriously people, is it SO difficult to have a little bit of common courtesy?? We visit NYC several times a year and seldom stay in the same hotel twice just so we can experience the variety of accommodations and neighborhoods the city has to offer. NYLO will be an exception to this rule. We WILL return here in the nicer weather and take greater advantage of Central Park, Columbus Circle, explore more of the UWS. Our biggest complaint was the fact that W 77th St. was closed when we arrived and we therefore had no access to the hotel's valet parking. Consequently, we circled and circled for a good hour until we found a garage down on Riverside that could take us. Unfortunately, it meant schlepping several blocks with luggage (battling bitter bitter cold temps and high winds) and after 24 hrs, it ran us $85!!! The only other complaint is having to pay for internet service in the rooms. The only free wifi accessibility is in the lobby (and their FABULOUS gathering/game room). The neighborhood has AMAZING restaurants and bars on even corner! Our favorites were The Meatball Shop and the Amsterdam Ale House. I am still on a search for an amazing NY Style Crumb Cake, so if anyone has any UWS suggestions, please share!! :) ","Fitchburg, Massachusetts","kerryyokee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fitchburg, Massachusetts</strong>",11,5.0

While the NYLO rooms have a ""hipper design"" and the bar scene at the NYLO is a lot more active, there are no dressers with drawers in the room, only cubbies to put you things in and only three or four of those. They only provide you with two sets of towels. There is no chair to sit on in the room other than the desk chair and there are no drinking glasses in the room only plastic cups and paper coffee cups and those are only given out sparingly. Additionally, when you check in they do not tell you that there is extensive renovation going on next to the hotel until you see a construction elevator going up and down in front of your window. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad hotel, the staff was friendly, and depending on the price differential I might stay here again, but price being equal (and this time it was) the Beacon Hotel is a better deal.","Somers, New York","roosterlaw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Somers, New York</strong>",10,3.0

I have stayed twice as a couple and twice now as a solo women. I enjoy the atmosphere and kind help, right from the front doorman to the check-in desk. I also enjoy the very comfortable beds. I must say this solo visit was the most disappointing visit yet. The doorman was still wonderful, greeting me at the door and helping me with my luggage to the check in desk. The check in was quick and efficient. After arriving in my room, after 17 hours of travel from the Middle East, I found a dirty bathroom. The tub was grimy and the toilet had urine and hair on it. I called down stairs to inform them that the bathroom in my room was not cleaned and ask if I could be moved. The front desk said they could send up a maid to clean the bathroom. I said I did not want to wait as I was exhausted and wanted to use the bathroom as soon as possible. She then sent someone up with a key to another room. This was all understandable, the disappointment came when I saw my new room, it was the smallest room I have ever been in at this hotel. I did not even have a place to put my suite case except on the floor squeezed by the bed. And it is a carry-on size suite case! At this point I was too tired to complain again, I just wanted a shower. This bathroom was also much smaller, with a small stall shower rather than a tub, and a sink with no space to place items on the side. It did still have shelves and hooks, so it was still useable. The meal in the attached restaurant Serafina, was mediocre. The pasta was suppose to be al dante but was borderline crunchy. My disappointment was in that the room they placed me in was unacceptable due to their fault of a dirty bathroom and I was down-graded to a smaller room when I told them of this mistake. This is poor customer service, especially for a repeating customer. It will make me rethink if I will rebook here again on my return trip at the end of January. Upon check-out at 5:00am, the front deskman did wave my internet charge due to me only being in the room about 10 hours. He also help arrange a ride to the airport. He was very pleasant and helpful. Recap of the positive: Wonderful greeting and front desk efficiency and super comfortable beds. Recap of negative: Dirty bathroom, so downgraded to new room and crunchy pasta.

The location can't be beat. The lobby bar is more like a neighborhood experience that a typical sterile hotel bar. Rooms are small but not bad by NYC standards and well designed to maximize room. Our room at the back was exceptionally quiet, but my sons' room which fronted on Broadway had significant street noise. Two notes on the downside, one regarding service and one the physical plant. First, I had an important delivery sent by UPS next-day. The staff insisted for two and a half days that it had not arrived; when I called the sender I was informed that it was delivered on the day promised and was given the name of the person who signed for it. Armed with that, I demanded that the staff produce my package, and they did so within two minutes; no explanation was offered for why they had been unable to come up with it and in fact had insisted that it was not delivered. The other issue is structural: the windows are very poorly insulated for temperature, and on a cold night in January a column of icy air must be partially blocked with the thermal curtains in place. Fortunately the bedding (on a VERY comfortable king bed) was quite warm and we slept comfortably.","Denver, Colorado","globetrotter33388</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",19,4.0

So the next morning I let the water run for the designed 15 - 20 minutes and I still had a cold shower. I was irritated and when I checked out I shared my experience with the front desk clerk. He was very apologetic about how the previous person handled the situation and made an adjustment for the fact that 2 of my showers were basically cold. I really appreciated this and it gave me a reason to give them another chance on my next trip to NY.

I wanted to experience Christmas in New York without the excess of Times Square. This hotel was located in a very ""normal"" part of NYC with Central Park a short walk to the right and the Hudson River a short walk to the left. It was also a few blocks from the venue where Mariah's Christmas concert was held. The room was just the perfect size. And although there was no view to speak of, that was okay because I was out experiencing the Upper West Side most of the time anyway. Although I was awakened each weekday morning with the noise of construction, the bed was DIVINE (had it not been for the construction noise, I would've rated sleep quality a 5). Even though it was unseasonably warm in NY and did not feel like winter at all during my visit, the rooftop terrace was closed for winter which was kinda disappointing. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. The NYLO lobby was exquisite (and where the free Wi-Fi was accessible). Even though the NYLO was close to all forms of transportation, I chose to walk everywhere...to take in the sights. A casual (albeit somewhat long) walk down Broadway led me to 5th Ave and to Rockefeller to see the big Christmas tree. I would highly recommend NYLO to anyone who wants a NY experience without the madness of Midtown. I would most definitely stay at the NYLO again.",,keithbW4356BC,2,5.0

We know this hotel and room size so when we booked it I specifically asked for 2 big rooms for us and another couple, as we come with many luggages and we need a big space for them, i called reservations to make sure that the room is big enough and they assured it to me by phone but eventually we received a room which I think was meant to be a closet.... The other couple received big room however it was on the second floor facing Broadway and it felt like they sleep in the street with all that noise. We asked to move to other rooms in higher floor so after we asked to talk to manager they agreed to move us to bigger room for free but the other couple had to add $50 per night for moving them to higher floor.2 days before our check out we asked the hotel to help us order a transit to the airport and we told them we have about 10luggages and we need a big car like savanna, they send us to the doorman and he ordered small car which could not contain the luggages in a comfortable way, he told us it will cost $120, we asked him to order bigger one and he said he does not deal with bigger cars and he took us to the consigliere, the women at the consigliere ordered us car and she said it will fit for 18 people and it will cost us $175, we asked her several times in front of the doorman to be sure it is bigger than what he offered and she promised this to us.we paid her by cash. At the day of the checkout when the driver arrived we saw that the car she reserved us is exactly the same car as the doorman ordered us and not bigger, but the consigliere was not on duty to talk with and make changes, We asked to talk to the person in charge of the reception and he told us the consigliere is not part of the hotel although no one told this to us when we asked for a big car, he said there is nothing to do at the moment so we did not have choice and we needed to use the car that brought to us, we barely squeezed the luggagesthe driver himself told us it was a mistake to book his car. The manager of the reception promised to talk with the consigliere and ask her to compensate us for paying $55 more for the same car we ordered at the first place, but until now more than a week later no one from the hotel contacted us","Rishon Lezion, Israel","Aliza O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rishon Lezion, Israel</strong>",0,2.0

Reception where extremely helpful when checking us in. We were lucky enough to be staying in the Penthouse Loft suite which has an amazing view over the Hudson River. The room itself was spacious and well resourced, the bed was unbelievably comfortable which is perfect after a long day exploring New York City. The hotel is located 2mins walk to a subway station OR a scenic 5minute walk to Central Park (not far from the Dakota building). We enjoyed cocktails and beers at the bar every night, and enjoyed the live music that was being played. We also recommend a visit the Amsterdam Ale house which is 1 minute walk away. The staff at the Nylo are always around to help you, always courteous to your needs, and ensure you have a fantastic stay. We enjoyed breakfast in the Serifina restaurant most mornings (eggs benedict were superb). This set us up nicely for the rest of the day. Matthew (general manager) really made our stay memorable from start to finish for which myself and my fiancée will be forever grateful.

And given the demanding attitudes of New Yorkers, that's a ringing endorsement.","Sausalito, California","Gordius</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sausalito, California</strong>",71,5.0

Red Farm Yum Cha Chinese restaurant is so close and other great restaurants including Burke and Wills, coffee like Erving Farm and a Shake Shack. Easy walk to Columbus circle up Broadway or into Times Square if you have the desire to just wander a long and close to Central Park. And while it's modern and chic - the staff are not wankers. They're friendly and they respect their guests. Fast free wifi in lobby (but not room) which is a bit of a pain. Good web deals as well - particularly if you're looking for an upgrade.

The hotel has a big computer screen on the wall next to the lifts, this gives you the chance to search for good restaurants nearby and the weather among other things, this was very helpful. We stayed for 5 nights for my 30th birthday and were lucky enough to be upgraded to a very large bedroom with separate lounge, this made our stay a lot more relaxing. The room was very comfortable, very stylishly decorated, clean and we had a fab view of the Hudson River and Broadway. Our bed was big and amazingly comfortable, it felt like sleeping on a cloud.

Allowed us to keep our family of four in one room and still with lots of space, including a nice sitting area and a work area (which came in handy). Room was clean. Wifi was fantastic and we hooked up 4 different devices with no limitations. Really liked the lounge on the main floor, particularly the chess board table that we used a number of times during the stay post-dinner for a little relaxation and mental stimulation. Allowed me some time to work a little way through the bourbon menu at the bar! The only thing that was a bit odd relates to the cleaning staff and habits. We stayed 4 nights and the cleaning carts were always parked in the hallways and bags of garbage were seemingly always sitting in the halls waiting to be taken down. Very odd and in need of a service staff chat; public areas should generally be clear of all refuse except during the times when room cleaning is actually occurring. The last thing I want to do every time I come in and out of the room or elevator is look (and smell) at what the neighbour in the next room tossed in the trash the night before.A chat with the service staff would presumably have that resolved pretty quickly.Otherwise; all good.","Calgary, Canada","Ontheblackhill</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",46,4.0

The location is great if you've already been to Manhattan. You get to discover a different neighborhood and you have the Guggenheim, Metropolitan, Natural History and Moma very accesible and close by.Room wise, there were certain things that demerit what they charge. The doors are chipped, the floor under the bed an around the corners were very dusty. We found dust balls beneath the bed.The bathtub, had hairs and wasn't that clean at all. The mirror and the sink in general were with a little filth from the previous guest or the bad cleaning of the housekeeper, hard to decipher. In general it looks like they don't keep up with the maintenance thoroughfully. But the thing that brings my review to average is that we never got real hot water to bathe, only one day we had it, the rest of the days we had to shower with warm water. Fortunately, we had the best weather conditions, considering the time of the year, no real cold at all, if it had been at the normal low temperatures, this would definitely been an issue. In the summer, you will probably not even notice it.Other than that, the bed is really comfortable, mattress and pillows equally good!!! You really get a good rest and nite sleep after the marathonic days you expose your feet to. The room is smaller than it looks in the pictures but nothing you can't manage.The staff is ok, they will solve any questions or troubles you encounter, but won't give the extra mile to rate them as friendly or customer experience oriented.The lobby is great, it has a good vibe and atmosphere! You have a CVS five steps away, which is convenient in case you forget anything or need anything.

I was charged $110 for valet parking, when I thought I had parking included with my room rate. Long story short: there was some confusion with the parking package booking page on the website that I used to book my hotel (I used the website for the parent company as opposed to that specific franchise's site). I inquired about the charge & the weekend desk person was apologetic, but could not offer a refund. I grumbled about the charge all day & decided to call the hotel & ask someone else.

NYLO’s location on the Upper West side, and accommodations are a perfect fit for my family. The Upper West is close to Central Park and quieter than other sections of town, making it a perfect ""home base"" for a weekend or longer stay. The Upper West also has a number of great restaurants that we've found very welcoming to families. And, it's less than a 5 minute walk to a subway to get you up and downtown easily. So, no matter where you're planning on going, you can get there quite simply. The hotel itself is very comfortable. The room furnishings are unique, and possess a boutique hotel feel. The two rooms we've stayed in have high ceilings, open floor plans, and are spacious. After a long day making your way around town and throughout the hustle and bustle of the city, it's a nice feeling to come back to the room and relax without feeling cramped. More than anything though, it's the personal service that makes all of the difference to me. It's what brought us back, and will keep us returning. The doorman was polite, friendly, and very welcoming. There is no underestimating how important this very first interaction with a hotel is; he made my family feel immediately comfortable. The woman at the front desk who greeted us was just as pleasant and happy. Honestly, it felt like she was glad to see us! She was extremely accommodating, and had a room available for us, which enabled us to settle quickly and get on with our day. She was extremely helpful throughout our short stay, and also when checking out.Interesting additional note; after arriving home, I'd provided feedback to NYLO via email acknowledging some of the staff who made our stay so pleasant.

The foyer/bar area has a nice warmth to it, with a decent bar, though perhaps a bit lacking on the bar offerings (no winter drinks, in mid-December) and service (waited 15 mins at a table on one visit, and then just went to the bar). The RedFarm restaurant attached to the hotel is very good. Bar food was so-so. Wifi was part of our tariff, but understand it is charged for some other tariffs. I wouldn't pay for it; it was OK in the room, but weak in the public spaces.I booked a Queen-Queen Suite. First let me say that, as a ""room"" it was nicely presented, and quite spacious for NYC. The bathroom was huge, and had a great shower, though strangely laid out (wasting a good deal of space) and lacked some practical touches (what is it with hotel interior designers having fancy sinks with no usable storage on, under or anywhere near them). My major disappointment, though, was that the room was not, in fact, a ""suite"" - it was simply a large room. We were traveling as a family - self, wife and 6-year old daughter - and having an actual suite is key to us; so my daughter can go off to sleep in the bedroom, and the adults can still have a bit of time to themselves in a clearly separated lounge room. I was happy to pay a premium for a suite, but feel quite taken advantage of to get something of far less use - at least for my needs. For other potential customers, while I think this hotel has a lot to recommend it, I would advise that you carefully check what in fact it is you are getting.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","toddbessemer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",48,3.0

We usually stay at a smaller property in the Village, but decided to check the NYLO out and take advantage of a room with a balcony.The location is great! Its near the subways, Central Park, and in such a cool neighborhood that has everything you need.We booked a suite early and then noticed deals on the internet changing and getting better so we had like 3 reservations going at once. We went from a Skyline Penthouse to the Panoramic Suite. I was on the internet the night before and noticed the rate had been slashed drastically- one room left. I called the Hotel and told them I didn't see why I had to pay much more for the suite I had booked earlier when someone just hopping on line could get it for a steal. It took a little talking, but the Hotel did the right thing and let me change the reservation to the lower rate less than 24 hours of arrival without any cancellation fee. We saved around $700.00 or so. Upon arrival the Doorman greeted us and check in took less than 5 minutes. Our Suite was on the 14th floor. The room is larger by New York standards and the balcony was plenty big with two wicker chairs. The view was towards the Hudson. Not a full view, but between building it was a nice look with Jersey across the river. A little cool in the day, but still nice to able to get fresh air without trekking down to the lobby and outside. The room was adequately equipped. Coffee maker, but no fridge or microwave. Those are available upon request. We didn't. The coffee maker was supplied with one coffee, on decaf, and one tea. I have never understood this. When the room is occupied by two people you would think they would supply it with two of each instead of one. I asked for more at the front desk, but it seems to be a no brainer to make it right the first time or at least ask if you will need more than one each. No big deal, but still its the little things. The room had more than adequate enough room to move around and never felt cramped at all. A comfortable stuffed chair was provided along with the chair at the desk. Lighting is nice in the NYLO'S I have noticed. The bed was very comfortable and had nice linens and comforters as well as the pillows. The bathroom was big enough to get around in easily. It came with all of the usual devices such as hairdryer. The glassed enclosed shower was roomy with a great shower head. The towels were nice weight. Shampoo, conditioner, soaps were all a brand called Pure. The were good quality.The closet had the iron and ironing board and the one robe. I feel about the one robe as I do the one coffee when two guest are in the room. It should have two. It just makes sense.The Bar- First, I would say that I pre arranged for a bottle of Champagne to be in the room upon our arrival. I called ahead and talked with Dan, one of the bartenders. He set it all up with the Front Desk and we arrived a little early before check in by about 2 hours so the desk had it brought up right away and I mean we had not been in the room 5 minutes before it was brought. I also set up another bottle to be delivered through Dan while down at the Bar and again he set it up and took great care of us. Hats off to Dan for taking such good care and being very profession the whole time.Second, the bar area is nice. Its not real big and has two sitting areas on either side. It seems to do good business and we enjoyed drink at the bar two of our three nights. I give the bar 5 stars and Dan 10!We never took advantage of the restaurants so I cant speak about them, but I did notice a number of pizzas being delivered to guest at the bar.I give this NYLO property high marks overall. Very friendly staff. A all you could ask for location convenient to everything by foot, subway, or cab. I would return again without question, but even if I make reservation I would still keep an eye out for price reductions. We are planning a return to NY the end of January and we are planning on staying at the NNYLO again. I like the Panoramic Suite a lot, but would like to try the Skyline Penthouse this time.","Houston, Texas","mccrazyone</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",44,5.0

I regret to say that this time around my experience at the hotel was quite the opposite. To begin with, the staff was short of treating guests with due courtesy, the doormen for instance were arrogant and rude, except for Ms. Ramona, who gave me a warm welcome and checked me in earlier, as I had just arrived from a long overnight flight across the hemisphere. She even scheduled a move to another room with a view as I had requested. To this point, guest service was sharp. Things started to change as I was constantly annoyed by the loud guests in the corridor every morning and night. In addition to the noise, the doors at the hotel were extremely loud and it felt like the whole room was shaken when your next-doors were on their way in or out. Another problem I faced, was that the heating system was very inneficient, I even got sick during the course of the stay because the facilities were very cold and the room did not have a cozy, comfortable feeling. The bathroom is all in tile and has no direct heating system. It was alwasys a challenge whenever I needed to use the restroom because it was too cold to have a relaxed experience. The sink is made of metal and it certainly makes you feel closer to a butchery fridge than to a modern piece of furniture. There are no towel racks, least of all a heated one, so towels always felt cold because they did not dry out enough and remained wet overnight. The cleaning staff was rude and loud as well, I had to get out of bed to request for silence one morning while they discussed about their month's payroll. Honestly, a good staff member should be invisible. A service cart was left day and night in the corridors, and to my misfurtune, right across from my door. I had to deal with the visual and audio pollution everyday as I walked in and out. Another issue, the Serafina restaurant left something to be desired. After complaints were presented, I was offered yet another move to a quieter room in the upper floors. When I arrived in the evening, the move had not been made. I had no other choice than leave. It was honestly a bitter surprise and, to my relief, I decided to check out earlier from an originally long stay, which is quite not common. On top of all of this, the amount charged was very incoherent with the service provided. I moved to another hotel in Midtown, and suddenly New York felt alive. NYLO no more.","Billings, Montana","fjacome</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Billings, Montana</strong>",2,1.0

ALSO, A very big problem we had was the fact that they actually advertise ""Valet Parking"" when in fact it's not valet parking, because they don't allow you to take the car in or out. When you check in, you leave the car for the duration of your stay. One reason may be because without telling you beforehand, they DO NOT HAVE onsite parking and in fact parked our car over one (1) mile away at an undisclosed location without telling us beforehand!! I guess this is why they can't actually deliver on Valet Parking, yet they CHARGE YOU for valet parking. Last but not least, upon checkout we asked them to hold our bags while we ate breakfast in the restaurant. When my disabled wife and I came back after about 45 minutes thinking our car would be waiting and ready for us, they told us it would be at least another 45 minutes before the car would be there. That's when I flipped, and I admit I lost my temper, but this was the first time I was ever threatened by a hotel employee in my life. You don't spend a weekend and 1k dollars in a hotel to be threatened. What ever happened to the customer is always right?

The location was safe, clean and although noisy from construction, totally fine. It is important to note however, that once you trade safety and a somewhat calmer atmosphere than the hustle bustle of downtown, you lose the ability to get anywhere easily. There are little to NO cabs in front of this hotel. We are a party of 5 and found it impossible every single time we exited the hotel to find a cab unless we walked south 4 or 5 blocks. That being said, the safety of the neighborhood was a plus. We travelled with 3 kids and there was a lot to eat, see and do around the hotel. You are definitely walking distance from central park and many fun cafes and restaurants. The atmosphere is neat-very chic urban loft sort of feeling. The bar is nice but always packed so we didn't get a chance to sit there. The rooms are TINY. I'm a Chicago girl and am used to sprawling space so perhaps I'm not a great judge on room size but we found it difficult to find a place for our suitcases and the bathroom situation was a joke. * note: we did get two adjoining rooms and the space issue was still a factor* The staff at the hotel was wonderful. We had a few small issues and they were very good about dealing with them appropriately. Our biggest issues however, were upon leaving the hotel. We were not able to get a cab to the airport on the way out and the staff said there is usually a driver with an SUV that we could hire for a little extra-well, he wasn't available that morning and we instead had to arrange for an Uber driver to come get us. Not a huge deal but frustrating when you're trying to get three kids and a load of luggage to an airport on time. The largest issue was incredibly disappointing-upon boarding the airplane I realized that I had left my sons contact case bag in his bathroom on a shelf. I immediately phoned the hotel once I landed in Chicago and was told I would need to leave a message for the security team. I did that and didn't hear from them after 24 hours. I phoned the hotel again and was transferred to the security team-I spoke to a man who told me he ""didn't understand me"" and proceeded to hang up on me. Now, I am American born and have zero accent-I'm not sure why this man didn't understand me and understand even less why he would hang up on me. At this point I lost all patience and called back and asked for a manager. I again got a voice mail. I left a voicemail there and then emailed corporate online about the missing item. I got a phone call back a few hours later from security and they told me that nothing had been turned in. I explained to them that this is not something that can be resold or is of any value to anyone but my family and that the replacement cost was $1500. The security officer told me he would call the woman who had cleaned our room the day before but ended up finding nothing. Its truly a shame, even though this is ultimately my fault, that the cleaning crew just threw this out. The hotel was OK-location is good for safety but lousy for travelling outside the area, the staff is nice but obviously some a negligent about any ""extra"" work they might have to do in putting personal items aside for reclamation, the rooms are small but clean. All in all, I would've rather stayed closer to downtown where we went every day and avoided the extra hassle.","Chicago, Illinois","julieg96</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",69,3.0

I asked for a quiet room and was given one: spacious, extremely clean and comfortable, though with no view to speak of. The bathroom was fairly dated (tiny, old-looking bath), but had everything I needed and was spotless. There was ample storage space, great lighting (can't stand gloomy rooms that are impossible to read or work in), a truly fantastically comfortable bed with lovely linens, and the coffee machine was welcome indeed.I didn't eat or drink at the bar, but it looked like a great place to hang out. It should also be noted that every single staff member I encountered was truly delightful: warm, friendly, welcoming. Special thanks to Johanna for excellent service when I checked in, and for giving me a code for free in-room wifi (though, let's be honest: all hotel wifi should be free, and that's one improvement I can suggest to NYLO. The idea of having to pay for wifi had almost been a barrier to my booking the hotel at all.) I've stayed in this part of town before so I know the location would be ideal, and indeed it was: Midtown is a comfortable walk or short subway ride away, the glory of Central Park just moments away, and plenty of shopping, eating and drinking options.

We felt so adult! Hey, we're 60, it's about time! We wanted a location convenient to the west side because we knew we wanted to walk around Chelsea, High Line, W Village, etc. So we chose the NYLO and it turned out great. The #1 line is a quick and convenient way to go N and S in Manhattan and we rode it many times, either from 79th St. (local trains) or 72nd (local & express). My wife is artistic with a modern sensibility and I like that style too, so the modern industrial look of the NYLO - with vintage bohemian touches thrown in - was just right. Every night the lobby was jumping because the bar is popular in the neighborhood and with the guests. The hotel staff in the lobby were all either hot, intriguing or both (not just my opinion.. wife said it first). We had a room toward the low end costwise but it was fine. Bed verrrrry comfortable. We faced the street which I recommend - it wasn't too noisy, though ear plugs are always a good idea. One odd thing was that our room had a door adjoining another room and we could hear noises in that room pretty easily. There was a mom and sometimes-crying baby in there. But it didn't turn out to be a problem. Again, ear plugs recommended. The upper W side is a great neighborhood to explore, even if the restaurants, watering holes etc. aren't as well-known as those elsewhere in the city. Zabar's might be slightly overrated but definitely worth a visit for the lox alone. There's a nice, quiet, independent coffee spot in the Apthorp building worth visiting. If you want a neighborhood park feel, walk over to Riverside Park where there don't seem to be many tourists. You can also, of course, walk over to Central Park but at least by the Museum of Nat History there were many many tourists which was a bit of a buzzkill. Can't wait to go back to the NYLO and next time we'll stay for more than two nights! Restaurant tip: for a romantic, stylish dinner, try one of the pocket-size Gabe Stuhlman restaurants in the Village such as Little Owl, Fedora, Bar Sardine.. we went to Fedora and it was a great choice. General tip: maybe we had the magic touch, but in our experience people in NYC were helpful, fun, stylish & friendly.

It was not. It was closed for the season by then. Which put a significant damper on our planned photography.3) I specifically reserved the penthouse suite overlooking central park. Again, when I toured the facility, I was shown a penthouse suite with a very spacious terrace and then upon request was reassured that our room would have such a terrace. It did not. On the day of, we were stuck in a corner suite with a very small terrace. Despite my specific request.

But instead of offering us to bring it to the room when this would be ready, they said, you have to pick it up later and bring it to your room.

The walls are so thin that not only could I hear the footsteps next door as if they are in my room, I actually felt the vibration of the footsteps thru the floor. They were not heavy foot falls, just normal. Another neighbor had a small dog that barked when it needed to go out. At some late hour I was woken by it. It sounded like it was in the room with me. My room faced the street and delivery trucks and all other of noisy traffic starts up at 4am. Again I felt it was right under my window.

We have stayed at the NYLO 6 times in the last 18 months but will probably not stay there in the future. The area construction not only means ongoing noise but the adjacent building has blocked 1/3rd of rooms' windows. Given that another third of the rooms have windows onto the lightless interior 'courtyard', only a minority of hotel rooms offer daylight. I would have thought that a hotel faced with such challenges would respond by amping up customer service-unfortunately this is not the case.

A few drinks (from the local liquor store) on the rooftop terrace was far more enjoyable!We chose the breakfast included rate and were not impressed that, although the room was booked for 2 adults, we were only given 1 breakfast voucher per day. The breakfast restaurant's food and service were pretty average so we looked forward to our alternative breakfasts in the end!The hotel service was not very personal and we felt the only time the hotel showed much interest in us was at check in and check out.Our room was on the 77th street side, directly opposite a large construction site. No advice, apology, or even mention was made of this. The very loud noise started about 7am each weekday morning but we just put up with it. In hindsight we should have requested another room as it appeared there were many others to choose from. There is no refrigerator in the room and you need good directions to find the only ice machine (it's on the 12th floor!).In summary, it's an expensive city and we paid a little extra to stay at NYLO. I suppose we got our money's worth because there are lots of much crappier looking hotels around. It wouldn't be too hard to improve the hotel but I doubt that will happen. If we stayed in NYC again we'd consider other options but would go back to NYLO if we didn't find anything better. We wouldn't take the breakfast option and would make sure we got a quieter room.","Brisbane, Australia","Matt P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",0,4.0

The bathrooms range from quite spacious to not at all.. real luck of the draw. The bad Construction noise was very present in two out of the three rooms we were in (421 was nestled in the middle of the hotel facing a courtyard - very quiet, though obviously no view). Not much the hotel can do about this, but it is going to be an issue for the next 12-18 months + as one of the sites across the street is just starting up. There is a second site that is much more advanced adjoining the hotel.Luck of the draw with rooms - I prefer to know approximately what I'm getting when I book.. Service - while the staff is generally friendly, they really won't do anything special for you... no particular recognition from their ""Club Nylo"" despite staying there multiple times in a short time period.. for instance wouldn't let me know if a specific room was going to be available for my next stay in a couple days, citing privacy concerns - I didn't really care who was in the room, just if the room was booked or not.. Hallway noise is pretty substantial - the doors do little to block it outGenerally minor quibbles in any hotel claiming 4 star status - wrapped plastic cups vs. glasses, no umbrellas in room (they were available at the door), robes, etc. Got the feel that the trendy claim was an excuse to cut back on services.. I really feel like the construction noise colored my opinion of the hotel - if you need to be on the UWS and are willing to risk being woken up around 630-7 every morning, it is really a decent spot.

The location of the hotel is brilliant. In the Upper West side, the subway a short walk and central park a block or so over. A lot of eateries and shops nearby. The beds - super comfy! The overall appearance of the hotel was different, modern and quirky! Even though on closer inspection it's wallpaper, the rooms have a cool New york vibe with the red brick panel. Most staff we encountered were pretty friendly too.Unfortunately for us, the negatives outweighed the positives. I must be completely candid because I really hope the hotel takes this review on board to spare future travellers the same problems.We stayed for 9 nights at this hotel. Upon check in, we were told we were not allowed to use our travel MasterCard to pay for incidentals. We offered a range of different options as we did not have our regular credit cards with us. We suggested cash, using my credit card on file that I'd already paid with (hence no security issues as it's my card that I'm authorising) or having a parent pay over the phone with my credit card that would match up with the one on file etc etc... These were all bluntly rejected as they were not in accordance with 'hotel policy' as they could not 'manually enter the credit card'... they 'needed to swipe the card physically and cash was not accepted'.This was extremely exasperating because we were essentially left option-less. The only option given to us was completely impractical and cumbersome. Our (computer illiterate) parents, late at night in Australia, were emailed a 'credit card authorisation form' which they had to print out, fill out, scan back onto the computer, and attach a photo of their credit card and ID and send the email back. (Which defeats the original 'policy' of not being able to 'manually enter credit card numbers' which they would have had to do in this instance...?) After 2.5 hours of back and forth, we were allowed up into the room and as sorry given complimentary wi-fi. In my humble opinion, that situation could have been handled a lot better to avoid unnecessary drama and a subsequent negative impression of the hotel we were so looking forward to staying in.What would the hotel have done if we didn't have someone back at home to do that for us? Then what? Would we have been refused entry into a room we had already paid for? I'm just not sure what their policy would have been for that...The walls of the rooms are extremely thin. You can hear (loud) conversations occurring in the next room and in the corridors. And on top of that there is loud construction work Monday through Saturday (which I understand the hotel cannot really control) but I'm sure is a common complaint amongst guests so surely something (anything) can be done.Basic cleaning was not up to standard either. There was hardly ever any bottled water left for us, no coffee, and surfaces were never wiped down.Unfortunately, a lot of these things probably wouldn't have been such a big deal. We're pretty chilled people who like to see the good. But because of the extremely frustrating check in altercation, the rest of the stay was left on a sour note. Some feedback which I sincerely hope the hotel takes on board... change these inflexible/unnaccommodating payment methods. You need to understand, travellers only carry travel cards because a) every other hotel seems to accept them with no problems and b) the whole point of a travel card is that you expect it to work/be accepted overseas, hence you not having to bring your regular credit cards incase you lose them. You need to offer practical workarounds for your guests who invest a lot of time and money into accommodation and service (which plays a huge part into the overall trip) to be exceptional.

The staff and service was excellent and the bar area in the lobby was nice and as expected.However, the rooms were a bit underwhelming. There were dusty drapes in the room behind the bed, the furniture was a bit basic. The shower was poor, a little basic shower head on a rail. However, the bed was Super King or even bigger and I slept well. One thing to note (although nothing they can do about it) is there is building work going on all around the hotel so we had to move rooms once as the noise was unbearable.The location was good- Upper West side and v near Central Park and public 'Boris bike' type system. If you are there make sure you go to Hummus for a meal. Superb.Overall I probably wouldn't return to this hotel- it's ok not amazing but also as a 30 year old married couple, would have preferred to stay in either Meatpacking, Greenwich, West or East village as more going on. This area is centrally located but more like Chelsea whereas we'd have probably wanted more of a cultural vibe.

In addition, I could hear the occupants in the room above walking around in their room.Unfortunately there is a lot of construction adjacent to the hotel, which starts early in the morning. I appreciate that the hotel can't do anything about this - but they need to adjust their prices to account for this fact.I noticed other problems others have raised - trash bags kept for days in the hallways and stairwells. Cigarette smoke could be smelt on the first level. And a rude security guard who asked to see door keys, if you were entering the hotel late at night/early in the morning.The worst part of my stay was the elevator issue. One bank of elevators was out of service (apparently for many weeks), so it caused major bottle necks, and delays at all times of the day. It was often quicker to use the stairs. For a hotel that is in this price range, this problem should have been fixed as a priority (I never saw any maintence/repairs being done).The one positive of my stay - the door men.

It's near a subway stop which is great. What wasn't good was the building works surrounding the place. Due to these works it makes the stay less enjoyable. Clearly the builders wait until 7am as they start hammering at 7am sharp and its very loud. It seems louder first thing and we could barely hear the TV without turning up the volume high.Admittedly it's not the fault of the hotel, yet the inability to acknowkedge there is an issue to the guests makes it very frustrating. It's a bit like a crying baby in a restaurant; it's not their fault but after a while it's irritating. A discount at the bar would be nice, but even just a curteous note in the room from management about the works would be something. In the end we slept ok once we bought ear plugs. Why on earth management don't supply ear plugs in the rooms complimentary (let's face it, they cost nothing) just makes me feel they are out of touch and should maybe try and see if they can sleep in a room after 7am.Sadly, was glad to be home and have a lie in which was such a shame as the bed was very comfy.","Manchester, United Kingdom","heymrchips</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",2,3.0

Especially, as NYLO offers its guests free champagne between 4-6pm, you'd think they would have at least provided the wedding party with complimentary champagne after the ceremony. Since it was after 6pm, it couldn't be done. Furthermore, I found we had to ask a few times to get wine glasses up to our room when we were getting ready for the wedding.

The rooms are comfortable and the price is right if you get your room through one of the hotel discount sites. I would never pay full price for a room here though. Most of the rooms are decorated with ""cheap Ikea-type"" furniture and unless you are in a suite you dont even get real glasses in your room.The day staff is helpful in general, the night staff however was a different story. They gave me such a hassle when checking into my room. My friend who I was staying with booked the room but I arrived first. I was told at the front desk that checking in to the room would not be a problem as long as my friend called the hotel and gave permission for me to check in. After about 2 hours of locating my friend and having him call the front desk, I returned to the hotel (all my bags in tow since the hotel refused to let me leave them there while trying to do what they said they required of me) thinking I would now be able to get up to my room, only to be told that the phone call wasn't good enough and that my friend had to be there in person in order for me to check in; something that wasn't going to happen for about another hour at least. All of a sudden the rules are being changed in the middle of the game. Keep in mind that it is now 2:30 AM and I am exhausted and about to climb on top of the front desk to lay down and go to bed. Long story short, we didn't get into the room until about 3:30 AM and I got to the hotel around 11PM. Any other hotel Ive ever stayed in, especially one I've stayed at a number of times, would have extended me a courtesy and let me check in especially if I had been told that all that needed to be done was have my friend call.

Prices were very reasonable - borderline cheap, particularly for a hotel with such great location, shopping and restaurants nearby. Just two short blocks to the subway station. But if you see a low price advertised, take it because they don't last long. Some of my colleagues checked a couple days after me on the site and the hotel had run out of the rooms at the lower rate. The hotel felt full while I was there - nice clientele, mostly European.There is construction right opposite the hotel, on 77th Street. Not the hotel's fault, and there is nothing they can do about it - so just be aware of this prior to booking your hotel room. The construction started at 7am - again keep that in mind. I was in New York for business, and was awake by 6:30 every morning, so the construction work did not bother me. By the time I returned in the evening, the noise was gone. Because the construction didn't interfere with my sleeping schedule, and because the hotel rates were inexpensive - this was a great hotel to stay in.The rooms are minimalist industrial, and the beds are very very comfortable. The room was clean, the sheets changed every 3 days - the only thing was that the complimentary water was not replaced after the first day. Bathroom towels changed ever day. Also they missed my wake up call one morning - so make sure to have a back up alarm on your phone!The hotel provided me free wifi in the room because it was my first stay at the hotel - that was a very nice touch, and very much appreciated.Front desk and concierge were very friendly, helpful with questions and luggage. The bar / lounge area and restaurants were always busy - it didn't feel like an empty hotel, had great atmosphere - but I didn't get to try them.

The room was really small; the door opens directly to the bed and there's a few space to move. The other negative point is that there's construction just beside the hotel. You cannot sleep after 7:00 am.,"Montreal, Canada","Chantal D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",0,3.0

I made my choice based on the hotel's website which shows very enticing photos of a penthouse suite. The reality however was a smallish two room suite with a very small patio area with room for two chairs facing forward and one small chair-side table - maybe 2.5 ft by 6 ft at the most. . The view was of the interior space between our hotel and several surrounding apartment buildings - no skyline, no street view and definitely no view of the Hudson River. Beware of what you book and know that you get may not be what you are expecting. Also be aware (this is on their website) check-in STARTS at 4:00 pm so plan your first nights activities accordingly particularly if the need a little preparation time.My wife and I visit New York once or twice a year and like the Upper West Side bit we will not return to this hotel.

Hotel is very well located for both Central Park and Hudson River visits. Two blocks to the subway and plenty of Uber/Taxis up and down Broadway. Room was well organized including very comfortable bed and nice bathroom. Lobby and bar were always well attended and had a great atmosphere with bartenders who knew how to take good care of their patrons. Our concierge went the extra mile on a couple of requests including locating a Black and White cookie! She was fantastic. Construction across the street on 77th but it was never an issue for us. Would definitely stay there again. ,"Tulsa, Oklahoma","rcarter0920</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tulsa, Oklahoma</strong>",7,5.0

The room was also very clean and comfortable. A great accommodation to stay in for a week, very close to Central park to have a walk after a long tiring day.
