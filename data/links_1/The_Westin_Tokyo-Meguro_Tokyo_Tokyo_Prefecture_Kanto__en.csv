We paid for five nights in advance. I am a Bonvoy Gold Elite member. Unfortunately due to a weather delay in San Francisco we missed our connecting flight to Tokyo by 15 minutes. As soon as we learned we were going to delayed by a full day, I called the hotel and spoke to the night desk clerk. She couldn’t alter my reservation to change it to four nights and issue me a refund even though I was calling more than 24 hours before I would have arrived. She needed to consult with the day manager which is understandable. But since I was going to be in transit they told me to straighten things out when I arrived. When we finally arrived in Tokyo and we are checking in, the pleasant but inexperienced desk clerk asked me sign for an arrival date 24 hours in the past. they were charging me for five nights even though my arrival date was off by one day and we would only be staying 4 nights. When I asked the front desk clerk about this she seemed confused meaning that my check-in date had not been altered. Evidently no issue with my reservation been relayed to the front desk staff. We asked to speak to the manager who promptly came out to resolve the issue. He was aware of the issue but was reticent to issue a refund. However, to his credit, As a gold elite member he offered me hotel credit instead of a refund. This was OK since we were going to be there for four days and we’re going to eat in the restaurant and use spa services which would’ve eaten up the refund anyway. The hotel has a nice lobby. The rooms were large, nicely appointed with decent bathrooms. The rooms are like American sized hotel rooms rather than the typical small Tokyo hotel rooms that are described on Tripadvisor. In other news, be aware that any notations that you make in the Bonvoy app (as far as special requests go) get completely ignored so just make those requests when you get to the hotel. I’ve had this experience over and over again at hotels within the Bonvoy system. Also my experience with using your phone as your key never works either. I’m not sure if that’s just something unique to the nature of the reservations that I made or if it’s endemic to their entire reservation system since the change to Bonvoy system. The buffet at the Westin was OK, typical hotel faire and certainly not spectacular. I found that the bed (in my room at least) was rather hard. The linens were great as usual at the Westin but usually the heavenly bed experience is heavenly and this was ....not so much. The staff was uniformly pleasant although there was some degree of language barrier but for the most part everyone was able to communicate fairly well in English. I did stop by the concierge desk to ask about having my luggage transported from the hotel to Narita airport. The lead concierge did not know the answers to my questions which I thought was unusual given that luggage transport between hotels and airports is relatively common in Tokyo. However she was Conscientious about following up on my questions and getting me the answers. She actually wrote a letter with the answers to the questions and various options for getting from the hotel to the Narita airport. I thought it was nice that she went the extra mile to actually write the letter and include the pricing of the various options. However I thought that the answers that she came up with was a little unusually pricey: ¥67,000 for transporting my wife and myself and our bags from the Westin hotel to the Narita airport by private taxi transport. That’s US$610. Well I don’t mind paying for convenience but I don’t want to buy the equivalent of another plane ticket just to go from the hotel to the airport. We eventually opted for a taxi from our hotel to the Shinagawa station and then from Shinagawa to Narita airport using the Narita express train. Taxi was approximately ¥2000 (US$20) And two one-way tickets from Shinagawa station to Narita airport terminal two (international terminal) set us back about ¥3000for the Narita express train tickets and another ¥3000 for the standard fare that goes along with that. So be aware if you want to do that you need to buy two separate tickets —one for the standard fare from Shinagawa station to Narita airport and one for the reserve seats on the Narita express. I would advise buying those train tickets in advance so you are guaranteed your seats and know what time your train is departing. So total out-of-pocket for us to get five bags and two people from the Westin hotel in Tokyo to the Narita airport terminal two was approximately ¥8000 or $72 USD. The trip from the hotel to the station took approximately 20 minutes by taxi and the trip from the station to the airport on the train was rapid even though Narita is quite a distance out of the city, it took 1 hour and 20 minutes. With the transfer of the bags from the taxi to the train allow for an additional 15 minutes, so total transit time would run you about one hour and 50 minutes. Now you may ask why not just take the Ebisu station train which is nearer to the hotel. Because that is at least a brisk 15 minute walk and that’s with moving walkways. That is not something that you want to do with five or six bags in tow if you are time-limited to get to the airport. And you still have to get from Ebisu to Shinagawa station which is another several stops. So doing that waste 15 minutes to get to the train station, more minutes waiting for the train and then the transit to Shinagawa to catch the Narita express. Easier to just take a cab directly from the Hotel to Shinagawa, it saves time and effort for $20. We made the walk from the hotel to the Ebisu station multiple times per day. It got old pretty fast. we don’t mind walking, it just adds up at the end of the day when you’re already tired. All in all if I were to stay in Tokyo again I would choose a hotel closer to a train station than a 15 minute walk.","Richland, Washington","Essequibo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richland, Washington</strong>",9,4.0

Extremely safe, clean and beautiful hotel. We booked a suite with club lounge and the room did not disappoint. I am a titanium elite level traveler and this hotel definitely acknowledged the loyalty and provided excellent service. Our room had an amazing view of Tokyo. Jim Woodrow was a standout in all things service. He provided us with a converter, a luggage rack and a roll away. He gave us great recommendations for a local restaurant. Jim went over and above to make our stay fantastic! We were unaware of the covered access from the hotel until late in our stay and we heard about it from Jim. The breakfast included a large variety of choices, American and Japanese. It was an easy walk to the train stations. The only thing that could be improved is the food and service in the Club Lounge. Some of the food in the evening was old and stale and the choices were not good. There is access to the 22nd floor for complimentary drinks that were well crafted (for titanium level and maybe other levels?) that we really enjoyed. Would love to stay here again.

Usually a pretty easy going Titanium Elite, but found a stay a little disappointing, and 3 stars probably generous for the particular stay. 1) Location's not particularly convenient if arriving by train with luggage. Took Shinkansen from Kyoto, by the time I'm at Ebisu station, I realized it's going to be 10-15min walk. Decided to take a taxi from there but got in an awkward moment where I felt bad for the driver who was waiting at station for pick-up given its such a short ride. 2) Lounge access offered from 5:30-7:30, but main lounge had a waitlist so was recommended to a backup temporary lounge in the Emerald room - Fine. Got there, but was again ask to wait until a table is set up - Okay. Finally my wife and I got seated, we went to get food, and within 2 minutes, our table was mistakenly given away to another guest and we were ask to transfer to a different table - Really? If this was not already bad enough, we realized that the food ran out (see picture), and this was when we arrived smack in the middle of the evening snack period at 6:30pm. In the end, we just took two soda and left. 3) Learned our lesson the first time, arrived extra early for breakfast. Great decision because by the time we finished at around 7:30am, there was already a line of around two dozen peopleThe only credit I can give to the hotel is that at least the staff try to be polite, even though my problems are clearly not solved, and that the rooms are on the more spacious side for Tokyo.",,davidweig,3,3.0

As a gold elite with Marriott/SPG the service was lacking.

Asking for directions to the subway or trying to book transportation to the airport was impossible with the front desk clerk. The room we were in, which was an upgraded room with a decent view of the Tokyo Tower, was in need of some TLC. Wallpaper coming off, roof had cracks in it, etc.All in all, a very average stay.

The room we had was large, very clean and the views were excellent. I have to say we were disappointed with the executive lounge service and exclusivity during our stay. It was very rote and cold service e.g. we were asked our room number immediately each time we arrived even by the same hotel staff and having been there a few days already. Also, on one occasion we had to be ushered to a 4th floor banquet room due to overcrowding of the executive lounge on floor 17. Additionally, there was little to no food on several nights due to so many guest stampeding to the evening buffet when the food comes out.

Inspite of the busiest time of 2019, the hotel made sure that the experience matched with all my previous stays. Managing lounge or, even a request for a meeting room in the lounge, the service was seamless. Staff was as always ready to help as efficiently as they always can. Also, the hotel is situated centrally in a very nice and calm area around Eibisu Garden, which makes it accessible to business centres through the train or taxi.

The standard rooms are good value - there's room for two chairs and a working desk, even if you are in a room with two beds.The hotel is conveniently located - about a kilometer from both the Ebisu and Meguro stations on the Yamanote line. The Ebisu station is connected by a moving covered walkway. There's a good-sized branch of the Mitsukoshi department store, a convenience store and drugstore within easy walking distance and a small grocery store in the basement of the Atre complex. There are many decent restaurants in the Ebisu Garden complex that have menus in English, but I'd recommend venturing across the street from the Ebisu Station, where there are higher quality, more authentic restaurants.As you'd expect, service is extremely good here.

I’ve always like Ebisu as place to visit as I find it not as chaotic as other districts in Tokyo.Location wise, I would say The Westin is both great but potentially not so great. The positive is that if you’re landing at Haneda airport, The Westin is very quick and easy to get to. I took the train with one change to Ebisu station and I was at the hotel in just under 40 mins.

The best part of all was the breakfast, they serve breakfast in many locations including in Mai which is a Japanese restraint on the 1st floor. The main breakfast floor is on the ground floor and has a dream selection of food; western and traditional Japanese. We had rice balls, miso soup, noodles, fruit juice, omelettes - all for breakfast.

It is an excellent location, walking distance to trains, and is attached to a large complex which has restaurants, a supermarket and bars as well as shaded outdoor space. The rooms are very spacious (except cramped corner rooms), and the decorations are more western then they are Japanese. The rooms need a renovation however are extremely functional. It is a fully staffed hotel and they really try to help as best they can. So why only 3*? Our check in took almost thirty minutes and the lady who checked us in was a poor communicator. So we stood there as she clicked and typed and went back and forth on her screen without a word from her. Finally I asked if everything was ok, she said ""Yes"" and then we waited another 5 minutes. Finally she got it all together and we received our roomkey. Less then 4 words were spoken. Not a comfortable situation nor a nice welcoming check in experience. This is the face of the Hotel, IMHO and they must communicate. Lastly, our room came with Breakfast and the first morning it took 40 minutes to get 3 cups of coffee. Second day it took 30 minutes. They were extremely short staffed in their buffet/main restaurant. We were not the only ones upset, an AU man yelled at the manager ""Why am I waiting 30 minutes for one damn cup of coffee????"" Absolutely terrible service, not becoming of a 5* or even a 2* hotel. They had people lined up outside to get in, some waiting 20 minutes and they couldn't get a cup of coffee to the table in under 30. This was our experience for 4 days. So my suggestion would be to allow yourself time if you are planning to go to work as the waits are quite terrible and unacceptable. Overall the location and larger room size is what brought me back.

Although the people of Japan are really 5 stars. They work hard to care for their guests. The hotel has removed a lot of key amenities, for example, the 22nd floor Compass Bar is now a craft cocktail bar and it is NOT great. Their use of paper straws disgusts me too. The straws wilt and disintegrate. Use metal stirring sticks like the Park Hyatt and the Grand Hyatt. This use-to-be a true, luxury lounge with amazing views and tremendous mixed drinks, with REAL Japanese mixologists who cut their own ice, and meticulously crafted your beverage. It’s barely acceptable now, and with the push to homogenize and politically-wash the planet, the Westin has stopped allowing cigar smoking in the Compass Rose Bar, which sat empty most nights. This is just sad. They have now relegated their luxury cigar smokers to a 12’x12’ “closet” with no windows. #SadSpaceThe SPG Lounge on the 17th Floor is well below international standards of quality for Marriott properties. We spent 4 days at the Sheraton in Yokohama and the Westin was well below the quality of a Sheraton? The Sheraton food and beverage trumped the Westin badly. Their Luke-warm tap water tasted awful, the breakfast lacked selection and was not rotated often making the food look old and unappetizing. Overall, the buffet breakfast in the lobby, while offering a tremendous selection, the quality there and the age of the food also made it unappetizing. It was not a great experience.

There are several restaurants, though most are quite expensive. As an alternative, the concierge lounge on the 17th floor has a pretty good breakfast.

As Titanium members we had access to the Concierge Lounge, as well as flexibility on where to have our daily breakfast -- our favorite being the excellent dining room on the lobby level (our other options being the French restaurant on the top floor, the Concierge Lounge or on weekends, the traditional Japanese restaurant). If there is any room for improvement in the hotel and its service, it might be in the Concierge Lounge which can get a bit hectic, and food replaced very slowly, when the lounge gets very busy.Oh, and weather permitting, do take a leisurely stroll through the hotel's garden.","Port Saint Lucie, Florida","Linda K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Port Saint Lucie, Florida</strong>",399,5.0

Receptionists need more training and be more professional, good Compass Rose bar on top floor, no swimming poor here, decent gym, old but well maintained room. Room sound proof is poor, you can easily here footstep above you. Taxi from this hotel to Haneda is about 30mins, costs about 7500-8000 JPY. I don’t see why tourists want to stay here.I only stayed 3 nights but I had 4 issues here. First issue I had was the Marriott Elite check-in line was not attended. When a staff saw me lining up there, she ignored me. I approached her and she told me there was only one regular line. She could at least tell me that instead of ignoring me. I waited for 10 mins to check-in. Then a nice gentleman (forgot his name but he’s the only Japanese staff member at the time) checked me in and apologized for the delay and unattended Marriott member line.Second issue, I told them to combine my two separate bookings in advance but they did not do it properly. They could not find my second booking for a while. Third issue, the guests above my room was partying. They said they could not do much other than moving me to another room. So I lost my Tokyo tower view room and the staff said I was upgraded to the Tokyo tower view in the first place and pretty much I should not complain about a room without one. I was pretty upset at that point and then she waved my breakfast charge during my stay. Fourth issue, as expected, I was billed for the breakfast and spent good 5+ minutes for the staff to correct the bill. When I approached the staff, she insisted nothing was wrong until another came to sort it out. The manager could only apologize and acknowledged that he often got complaints by Marriott elite members for not being valued in Westin Tokyo.As for the hotel and the room, it is decent, a bit old but well maintained. For almost $400 a night, I will stay somewhere else in Tokyo next time with Japanese hospitality. The location itself is not super great if you do not have business in Ebisu or Meguro. I definitely do not see why tourists want to stay here. Breakfast was ordinary and I don’t think it is worth the money if it is not part of your room package. I had way better buffet breakfast in cheaper Japanese hotels. The gym was decent but did not have many equipments such bench press with barbell nor smith machine. No swimming pool here. I do like the Compass Rose bar in the top floor, classy and nice cocktail. No cover charge as far as I know, hotel guest or not. Westin and Marriott continue to disappoint. I will likely stick to Hilton chain going forward. ","Sunnyvale, California","Soodye</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunnyvale, California</strong>",88,2.0

Some quick observations:1) The hotel has a very nice location -- it's about 10 minutes walk from the Ebisu station on the Yamanote line. The good thing about it is that the entire walk can be done in doors (it's a little maze-y the first time you do it, but it can be done.). If you don't know what the Yamanote line is, it's the JR ""belt"" around the city, and the easiest way to get to most places. Anyway, proximity to the line is great. There's shopping and restaurants within easy walking distance. If the train scene isn't for you, there's a near continuous line of taxis (and of course, the hotel will be happy to arrange a black car service.)2) The food at the restaurants is very, very good. Local Japanese friends know the Westin mainly for the buffet - which they very much enjoy. The breakfast is really epic, featuring western favorites and Japanese favorites. Being able to pair an omelet with rice and a wide assortment of fruit juices is a great way to start your morning. The upstairs Japanese steakhouse is great - but very expensive. The hotel has 3 or 4 other themed restaurants, but I've not eaten in any of them, so it wouldn't be fair to review.3) Staff is very freindly and helpful. I've had help with local attractions, travel, and currency exchange, and it's all been very friendly, and very professional.4) Rooms are very good. They're average size to an American, meaning that they're larger than what you'd get in a typical EU or Japanese hotel. Net: Great hotel in a very nice location with fantastic staff.

Easy to access rest of Tokyo from these stations & it was nice to return each day to a quieter & less frentic neigjbourhood. The Westin is large - many locals have their events & weddings here so there’s always a bustle in the lobby. The overall decor is grand in a 80’a vibe & does need a makeover to keep up with the times. However it is beautifully maintained & always scrupulously clean. Rooms are larger than average by Japanese standards and all the necessary mod cons for both business & leisure are there.

The staff are always gracious, helpful & so respectful. Many refuse to accept tips & it is such a nice change to see service that seems to come genuinely from the heart.

It is definitely a 5 star hotel with all the amenities. It's probably a little too old fashion lux for my likely however it has a lot of old world charm. The hotel itself is in upmarket Ebisu with many restaurants and shops near by. The train station is also fairly close. We decided to arrive at the hotel via JR and walk. It was probably a little to long to walk with luggage however we made it in the end. The rooms a very large and with nice views. If you want a really spectacular view, head to the bar on one of the top floors. Delicious cocktails, great service and a stunning outlook of Tokyo. My only negative would be the lack of security with the lifts. Anyone can access any floor of the hotel and can simply walk off the street. If you come into the hotel via the JR walkway, there are no hotel staff or security. When we were there, the hotel was extremely busy as it was Coming of Age Day. There were people everywhere for the ball that was on.

So the love of the location, breakfast and hotel itself goes without saying. This past trip was a 16th birthday celebration with my son - a mommy-son trip, hubby was left home. I was sporting a cane from a recent broken bone so having the helpful magnificent STAFF made the stay so much easier! Such a wonderful welcome from Lit Yee Shin. VERY helpful, kind, warm help we consistently got from Ai Watanabe. A lovely Aussie helped me with the bags and he is always great and helpful but I don't know his name. Before we even arrived the concierge team in advance and during the stay was top notch: Nami, Jun Kamimura, Daiki Takahashi. Mai Doyachi in rooms was very helpful making sure that we got the right room (two beds) Akemi ITO also very nice. Jim Woodrow and Rifcy Muhammad seem to act as hosts/customer relations. Rifcy on my last trip and on this trip in November was incredibly helpful especially this time because of my injury. Also helpful was some solo mommy 'down time' at the Compass Rose. The place feels like 'family' to me after all of our trips there: Mr. Taishi Miyazato and Mr.Takumi Kobari and Rina Kawaida are great. Mr. Miyazato and Mr. Kobari ALWAYS go out of their way to make the guests feel welcome and happy. The cocktails they create are works of art. Wish I drank more than just scotch on the rocks. ;) Mr. Miyazato and Mr. Kobari truly are highlights for me. Not only on this trip but in past trips with my husband who also loves them. Our room was fabulous with a view of Mt. Fuji. We can't wait to return...perhaps another November trip, this time with the whole family. BIG kudos to the General Manager!

Having a kitchen and multiple bedrooms for trips is a huge benefit. However, with our first trip to Asia, we wanted to have a hotel experience to ensure we could leverage an English speaking concierge and staff to help us with the language barrier. The Westin delivered in every way. First, the service. I emailed ahead and requested connecting rooms and was told it wasn't possible. However, upon arrival, we had been given connecting rooms which made everything better. The staff was incredibly helpful, well trained, and committed to impeccable service. From greetings at the front door, to the staff at the restaurants and lounges, everything was delivered with extra effort. I was in constant contact with the concierge via email asking for ideas and booking reservations. In one instance, they were able to get us a private room at a restaurant so our kids wouldn't be near cigarette smoke. Second, the amenities. The hotel rooms were nice but not extravagant. The lobby was very nicely appointed with a pianist playing some evenings. The garden outside was beautiful and the kids enjoyed exploring before and after our adventures in Tokyo. The lounge was great for a glass of wine or beer in the evening with an incredible view of Tokyo. Finally, the breakfast buffet. Oh the breakfast buffet. I'm Bonvoy Platinum so the breakfast was included. Western and Eastern foods. Curry. Dessert. You name it. It was the perfect start to our day and will be remembered for years to come. My only complaint is the Wi-Fi. It was slow, took ages to connect and would randomly drop calls. I was unable to take calls over Wi-Fi which meant either walking to Starbucks (not ideal) or paying for Cellular calls ($$$).

Love the location. Very festively decorated for Xmas. Great breakfast. The staff very kind and helpful. Worthy of mention: Mr. Taishi Miyazato manager of SKY LOUNGE Compass Rose is WONDERFUL and always makes us feel welcome. He remembered us from January as did the amazing and attentive Takumi Kobari Bartender and Whiskey Sommelier is fantastic.We had the pleasure of meeting Rina Kawaida. Captain of the Sky Lounge Compass Rose for the first time and she is a very good bartender. Before we arrived Jun Kamimura the concierge was VERY helpful making dinner reservations and helping with booking bus from Hotel to Airport. Aye Myat Mon Front Office Agent checked us in 11/24/18 and gave us a very welcoming check in. Met Mr. Rifcy Muhammad at check out who was gracious and helpful. Joshita helped with bags and was also very helpful and attentive.

The room was a bit old (design, carpet, washroom, etc). It's clean and tidy, which is good. It's too dark even after i turned on all the lights. The staff at the receptions and entrances were friendly, which is good. The price is considered as mid-range in Tokyo as many other 5 stars are very expensive at the time i stayed.The location was quiet. It's around 15 mins walk to the nearest station in Ebisu, so be prepared to have quite a bit of walking. I booked it along with the breakfast package. The breakfast was terrible. The food was ok and it's the typical Japanese standard, so it can't be too bad. It seems that they are always under staff. 2 out of 3 days my order of drinks either didn't come or need to ask for multiple times.","Hong Kong, China","KEGZ82</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",49,2.0

Rooms are very large by Japanese hotel standards with modern, traditional style furnishings, including small sofa and working desk. Bathroom is also large, with separate shower (rain shower and handle options) and soaking tub. Amenities include free bottle of water daily, mini-bar, bathrobes/slippers, in-room safe, plenty of bath products, and free wi-fi. Laundry was returned same day. There are several English language TV channels. Internet is fast.All employees with whom I interacted spoke excellent English and were very helpful and friendly. There are multiple restaurants (2 Japanese, 1 Chinese and a buffet). I ate both Japanese restaurants -- service and food were excellent, though prices are not cheap. As others have said, the hotel is located in a combo residential/commercial area 20-30 minutes by cab or subway from the center of the city. That said, the area is quiet and pleasant, with many dining options a short walk away. Two issues -- one major and one minor. The Westin Executive Lounge is a complete disaster in the evening. There is no access check of any kind. Anyone can access the floor and enter the lounge. No requirement for card key access and they don't even ask for your room number. As a result, the place is standing room only (literally) during the evening snacks/cocktail hour (5:30-7:30). The first night I arrived at 5:40. Had to wait/stand 20 minutes to get a seat. They were out of most dishes when I arrived; many of them (e.g., smoked salmon) were not replaced by the time I left at 7:00. Over the course of the 3 days, I learned that, if you wanted a seat, you had to arrive no later than 5:15 or wait 20 minutes. People started grabbing food at 5:15 even though service wasn't supposed to start until 5:30. Thus, they ran out of many items within 15-30 minutes and several were never replaced.Bottom line: Anyone from outside the hotel or inside the hotel can avail themselves of free food and drink and I suspect many of those in the lounge had not paid for the privilege (and might not even have been hotel guests). Some people took heaps of food, leaving none for other guests. The servers were super-friendly and did their best to keep up with demand, but it was not a pleasant experience and I was sorry I'd paid extra for it.Breakfast in the lounge, OTOH, was never crowded, no matter the time. The food was good, with both western and Japanese options. Eggs, meat, cheese, salad, breads, fruit, juice, cereal, miso soup, rice, etc. The other minor nit concerned a concierge dining reference. He sent me to a Japanese sushi restaurant (I love sushi). He'd given me only the English name but the signs were only in Japanese -- since there were about 10 restaurants in the immediate area, I had to guess which one was the right one. When I figured it out, I learned no one there spoke a word of English and the menus were only in Japanese. That's ok (it is Japan after all) but I'd specifically told the concierge that I wanted a place with some level of English since I don't speak/read Japanese. I ended up eating elsewhere.Overall, it was a good stay and -- if they fix the lounge issues -- would have been a great one. Definitely recommend it for US visitors, provided you are willing to commute downtown if you need to be there.",Virginia,"MisstheDogs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Virginia</strong>",244,4.0

There's even a way to walk the entire way to the station under ground -- just go to the B1 level of the hotel and follow the signs.

We didn't eat in the main floor buffet, it was always busy. We walked around the hotel, it's very residential, we didn't see any restaurants but there were several in the outdoor mall.

Marriott acquisition), but the recognition of loyalty that I used to know and love at the Westin Tokyo has gone out the window. I have been deeply loyal to Westin Tokyo, spending many five-figure thousands of dollars on accommodation over a short period of time (i.e. spread out over no more than 2–3 years).However it seems staff care more about short term revenue (i.e. the one-off weddings and events) rather than recognising the repeat loyalty of existing customers.In the ""old"" Starwood days, I used to get good loyalty recognitions:- I used to get minor upgrades to better positioned rooms- Staff used to do their utmost to help achieve successful early-checkin instead of saying ""sorry sir, come back for checkin at 1400""- Late checkout was always allowed until 1600. Now I'm told its 1400 and extension to 1600 will cost 50% of the full charge.It is unfortunate that my relationship with Westin Tokyo has had to come to an end in this way. However Westin Tokyo is not the only good hotel in Tokyo. I have no intention of ever staying at the Westin Tokyo again, the Westin Tokyo left me little choice in this decision, it makes me very sad, but what other choice do I have apart from ""vote with my feet"".It seems Westin Tokyo prefers to learn the hard way that it costs more to attract a new loyal customer than it does to do the small things to keep an existing loyal customer.","Eartham, United Kingdom","Q7972HFtims</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Eartham, United Kingdom</strong>",144,1.0

The decor is really out of date and dark, I could never get my room light enough. The Bad: HARD bed - not Heavenly at all. To be fair, when I asked for a pad or something on the bed to make it softer, they complied quickly (see above for them always being willing to help), but it didn't help too much - back aches all week and I never get them from a bed. Bathroom Amenities - I literally had to leave a note to have the staff leave my shower soap, but for some reason they kept stacking washcloths in my room each day - I had about 12 in there when I checked out. DO NOT ORDER a beer in the lobby bar w/o first checking prices. I ordered a Guiness and it cost $25 USD!!! Utterly shocking. TV CHANNELS - there are very few English channels. With a long stay, there's not much to see on TV, don't count on it for much entertainment. And the worst part was the dry cleaning - I left a bag w/dry cleaning, but didn't call them to pick it up. So they picked it up anyway, then told me they were going to charge me a 50% upcharge because I didn't call. I politely declined their upcharge.

Since I had used the ipad in the morning, I am quite sure that the incident had occured during my absence the room. No doubt whatsoever on this point. Upon reporting the issue, I was contacted by the Duty Manager with detailed report of who entered the room for various activities including Fire Alarm check, House keeping, Supervisor, etc. Bottom line, he said that he has checked with his employees and all of them said that none had touched my ipad. It is logical to have his point as counter if there was 1 staff member; when there are 4-5 entries and exits, in my view he should have seen that scope for ambiguity in staff statements do exist.

It's a short taxi ride to the station as well (~10 min) as there's no shuttle but not too difficult to get to. From an exterior standpoint, the hotel is pretty bland and blends into the skyline - however, the views from the rooms are nice especially on the higher floors. There's not many large buildings around it so you really get some great views of the Tokyo landscape. The front desk staff is quick, efficienty and friendly - they were able to check my guest into my room without me and were even able to upgrade us to a suite. Always appreciate it when hotels know how to treat their customers right.The room itself was very well appointed - comfortable and spacious with great views of the city. The bed was very comfortable (as most Westin's are) and the nespresso machine in the room is a nice touch (compared to the lame coffee you get in US Westin's). The club lounge is standard asian style - which is to say much nicer than the US. Breakfast had a wide selection, dinner hors d'orveus were decent, and they had a great liquor selection.Last thing of note, the bellmen were falling over each other to help us out... definitely very well appreciated. However, the concierge was very cold and unhelpful - I stood there for 5 minutes before she would pay me any attention as she was busy shuffling papers. Not what I consider acceptable for a luxury hotel at that price point, especially for someone like me who has traveled over the world with SPG (average 200 nights a year).

The decor is a bit dated, but kept in immaculate condition and still with its charm. The location was great, walkable, not overly commercial but not too out of the way. This was my first trip to Japan so I was very happy to find that everywhere we were interested in going was easily accessible through the local subway line. The bar upstairs in the hotel served a tasty cocktail in a trendy but not too loud or overdone atmosphere. The breakfast buffet had everything you could want from ramen, salad bar and sushi to the traditional bagels, omelets your way and an assortment of fresh juices.I didn't have much need to address the staff but any time I did everyone was hugely accommodating, polite and knowledgeable.Overall a really great experience and I would recommend it to anyone, particularly anyone a little wary of their first time to Japan and hoping for a bit of the comforts of the west.","Chicago, Illinois","jmlattimore</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",8,5.0

I tried their international breakfast buffet for a day and it’s a good spread - mixture of western and Japanese choices. Japanese choices are a little limited but it’s decent.

I’ve requested to store my luggage in the hotel and I will return on Monday to pick it up. I requested for the hotel staff to book a restaurant outside of the hotel for me on Monday afternoon. He is not able to do it because I’m no longer their guest. Is it normal? Japanese culture is so different that I can never be sure anymore. Anyway, I do not want to press it. Having said that, while I was staying in the hotel, I requested for a reservation at a restaurant, they were able to accommodate my request. Hence it is not a negative point if you know what I mean. Many nice and small eateries around and outside the hotel. There is this skewers place which is like 5 minutes walk away towards the Ebisu train station which is a worthwhile visit. I see a few older Japanese men there so I thought this place must be authentic and it exceeded my expectations. I wish I had a chance to visit that small eatery again.

The property is outstanding with large rooms, comfortable bedding (perfect after a long day of walking) and a tub and shower in each bathroom. Service was outstanding and they were well-staffed (unlike a couple of other places we stayed in Japan) and they were able to assist us with planning our outings, transport, reservations, etc. Most critically, Westin provides easy access to all the major sites. Using our JR pass at Ebisu Station, we accessed the Yamanote line which gave us direct access to Shibuya, Harajuku, Tokyo Station, Shinjuku and Ueno. This easy access was a huge plus on such a short trip.  The food at the hotel was quite pricey so most of our meals were taken while out. Lots of great dining in the area and we had excellent sushi and ramen at small local restaurants based on the concierge's recommendation.Yebisu Garden Place across the way also had dining options, including Starbucks. The Bar in the lobby was excellent for a nightcap and highly recommend the cardamom infused vodka tonic. There is also a small brewery museum located in Yebisu Garden Place which came recommended to us but we did not get a chance to explore. Highly recommend this for a short trip to Tokyo.","Mumbai, India","n_sura</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mumbai, India</strong>",4,5.0

We stayed elsewhere for our first few days in Tokyo, so we arrived early for check-in and they gladly took all of our bags to hold while we set out to sightsee. Every single employee we encountered in our entire 8 day stay was very friendly and helpful. We brought along our 6 month old son, and they had already set the crib up in our room when we arrived. We had a double room with 2 ""twin"" beds, but they were more the size of an American double bed. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was really nice as well. We were on the 14th floor and we had a great view towards Shibuya I believe. In the mornings, we opened the blinds all the way and set the crib in front of the windows, and my son was just fascinated.We had breakfast downstairs each morning; if you can get that as part of your rate, I would definitely recommend it! The ~$30 it costs separately is maybe a little high, but is in my opinion, still be worth it for at least a couple days. It was seriously awesome; they had every type of breakfast food imaginable. 6 months later, I'm still dreaming about the fresh made mango juice. I loved being able to pair our typical American type continental breakfast foods with dumplings and other international offerings!I worked during the day for most of the time we were at the Westin, but my husband and son had a great time! The weather was rainy, and they appreciated the underground passage to the Ebisu train station. I only wish we had known about it the first day when we walked there in the rain with our bags. To that end, it may not be the best choice for tourists if you plan to do most of your travel by train; it is quite a hike from the nearest station. But for our purposes, it worked really well! Overall, we really enjoyed our stay!

They have a great view of the Tokyo Tower area and a great selection of alcohol with most of the standard brands. There was light piano music playing in the background but not too loud so as to drown out your conversation. The room was on the 17th floor (Executive) with a great view of the Tokyo Tower area and had windows which opened about 4 inches to allow air to come in.

It maybe older, but it is a well kept beautiful hotel. We had a large room and bath that looked our over the city. Both room and bathroom was were very clean. The staff was welcoming and communicated well with our non Japanese speaking English. We had problems with one of the lights in the room and contacted the front desk Repairs were made promptly. On our last night we contacted the front desk because we were changing hotel and did not think we could make it back from Mt. Fuji in time to make our transfer to the new hotel in time for our check in. Someone from the service desk came up and gave an estimate on our luggage transfer. In the morning before leaving we took our luggage down for transfer, but were told we were given wrong information and the luggage would not be delivered until the next day. We told the service desk person we had been told it would be delivered that day, the person in turned attempted to contact another transfer service but we could not wait for transfer verification because we would have missed our tour. The service person promised she would do whatever she could to get our luggage transferred that day. We gave permission to charge our hotel account for the transfer and off we went to make our tour on time, with little hope we would receive our luggage that day. That evening after a long day trip to Mt. Fuji, dinner and finding our new hotel in a city we had never visited we arrived at our new hotel. When we checked in, we were told that our luggage had arrived from the Westin. My thanks go out to the staff at Westin Tokyo. When we received our credit card statement, we found the transfer only cost a few dollars more than we had been quoted. we could not read the Japanese bill that was attached to the luggage and had no ideal what the cost was. They were great! We would not hesitate to stay at the Westin again. An added plus is the market and food options in the mall across the street. At first it took a little searching to find all the restaurants, they range from fast to upscale food. We were able to pick up fruit and beverages from the market and have a nice dinner all in the same area. Loved our stay. Note: Our older daughter traveled with us. The beds are larger twins. We were able to put them together and it was larger than a king bed. Extra beds are over $100 per night and would have made the room tight.

If you have a choice, I recommend requesting a room facing west, because on clear mornings you have a completely unobstructed view of Mt. Fuji! Amazing! For us the location was ideal. It is a bit of a walk to the subway, but after you cross through Yebisu Garden (outdoor shopping center directly across from the hotel), there is an indoor passageway with moving walkways that takes you all the way to Ebisu station - very convenient in bad weather or if you are in a hurry. There are other stations nearby too. It really was a very convenient and central area - easy to get everywhere we needed to go. Tip: We found GoogleMaps to be a very effective tool for using public transportation within Tokyo and the free app Hyperdia to be the best for travel outside Tokyo.Breakfast was great at this hotel. The main buffet on the first floor is massive with many international options if you are wanting a big breakfast. Most days we chose the breakfast in the Club Lounge which was smaller, but still more than enough. The Club lounge has a nice happy hour too with some modest snacks. And very attentive staff.

I especially want to give a special shout-out for the staffs at the executive lounge. They were some of the nicest and most attentive people I've met. One time, I casually asked a staff member at the lounge where would be an ideal place to go shopping, the next thing I knew, the staff printed out the best shopping mall area map for me, with subway instructions included.

For experienced Tokyo-ites, the Yamanote Line will take you to many of the most popular places in Tokyo eg Shinjuku, Shibuya, Asakusa, Akiba, etc. For those who cant walk far, taking a taxi might be the only option. A Mitsukoshi department store is opposite the hotel, but apart from the convenience, I cannot imagine why any tourist would want to shop there when there are so many other much more attractive and interesting shopping areas in and around Tokyo.I didn't find the decor overly old-fashioned but can imagine why some do. We did get a reasonably quiet room and were able to rest well on comfortable beds at night. The morning breakfast does have a bit of a line sometimes, and the Japanese food selection really wasnt up to our expectations. The gym: I would call it reasonably well-equipped simply because unlike many other hotels, it has a bench press! You also get free weights, but not much else (not counting the cardio machines which are de riguer). Forget about chin-up bars or smith machines. A pec-deck machine and a lat pulldown just about rounds up what's available. You will get by with a reasonable workout if you don't expect too much.Overall, the place felt well-managed but impersonal, and just doesn't have the magic and character to get 5 stars from this reviewer.","Sentosa Island, Singapore","1stepheny</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sentosa Island, Singapore</strong>",17,4.0

We stayed at the Westin for a total of 6 nights both at the beginning and end of our trip. The Westin is located conveniently near the Ebisu stop on the JR Rail in addition to access to the subway at the back side of the rail station. The train station, although a 7-9 minute or so walk can easily be done entirely inside from the basement of the Westin through the connected Yebisu Garden Palace with moving walkways which leads right into the station. The JR Yamanote line connected us to much of Tokyo easily. We took the rail all but on a few occasions in the evening where cabs were easy to access from the front of the hotel. In addition, there are tons of restaurants within a stones throw of the hotel in the Yebisu Garden Place in addition to a department store with a small food hall in the basement. We took advantage of the restaurants in this area on two occasions as we were exhausted from our long days touring and wanted a nice bite, without having to take the rail too far. The restaurants are located on the 38th and 39th floor with great views of the city. The Westin has a beautiful lobby, attentive staff and clean and well appointed rooms. We stayed in two excellent rooms that were spacious, having a king bed and sitting area and large bathroom with stall shower and bathtub. Both rooms was also appointed with all the bathroom amenities, hairdryer and soaps and included complementary coffee and tea. We had a drink one evening at the restaurant on the 22 floor, although the service was terrible and they entirely messed up our order, they comped the drinks and apps as a result. Couldn't have asked for better service or the appropriate response. The view from the restaurant is stunning. We did not dine in any of the other restaurants on site, although there are many. We only ate one morning at the breakfast buffet which offers both Western and traditional Japanese breakfast. We took advantage of all the amazing places to visit in Tokyo instead. Overall amazing stay. Would highly recommend as a fabulous luxury hotel in a beautiful part of the city.

As we had many visitors visit us during our stay, having a comfortable living, dining, and kitchen was most helpful to entertain the visitors and still have our own space when necessary. The club lounge was comfortable to relax during the early evening for a light drink with family. I had 8 senior citizen guests over for lunch at our suite and ordered Shoka Bento box from their Japanese restaurant which was delivered on time, the food was delicious, and the setting on the dining table was done so professionally impressing my guests. I found their room service staffs to be very professional and hospitable. The breakfast buffet at the coffee shop was quite good but the staffs seemed a little over worked as the hotel was running at nearly 100 % occupancy.

It is a sight that is very pleasing especially sunrise and sunset - I don't get tired of viewing it. Something nice and unexpected was an air cleanser in the room, to help safeguard my family's health even though I was down with the cold and no doubt spreading germs. The staff from the check in, to the lounge, had all been immaculately polite and helpful, and kept apologising about the Suite Awards.

In my experience, they have the most consistent level of quality and service. It could also be that I've been brainwashed by their signature White Tea scent that breeds familiarity no matter the Westin I go to.Either way, I decided to cash in some SPG points and make the Westin Tokyo my base of operations for my family on a recent 7 day trip.Here are the 9 things you need to know, along with 1 thing I hated.1. Yebisu Garden PlaceArriving in the evening and suffering from jetlag, my first impression was that there was nothing around the hotel. I couldn't have been more wrong. Right across the street is a massive complex called Yebisu Garden Place. It's a mixed use business, art, shopping and restaurant district. Lots of open space and doesn't get too crowded. There's a high end department store (sort of like Sak's Fifth Avenue), a Starbucks, a convenience store, a pharmacy, a Burger King, and a whole bevy of restaurants to choose from. There's even a separate building of Joel Robuchon famed restaurants, one of them with 2 Michelin stars I believe. Underground in ""Glass Square"" you have a wide selection of udon, izakaya, French, American and sushi restaurants. In the highrise on the 38th and 39th floors, you have some really outstanding restaurants. I recommend the Yakiniku place Jojoen. A stunning night view of the city, with top notch meats grilled in front of you. Service is immaculate. Another nice place is a tempura restaurant, the name escapes me. You get a fixed menu multi course of the most delicious tempura that you've never had. Forget what you think you know about tempura. Besides the food, they also had a farmer's market on the Sunday afternoon filled with small vendors and handcrafted delights like honey, baked goods and more.2. Train a 15 minute walkOne small downside is the long walk to the Ebisu train station for the JR Yamamote line. But it's not so bad because the majority of it is via automated walkways that are covered. From there, you can make your way to almost any part of Tokyo for a few dollars. We used it to go to the north part of Tokyo, as well as another trip connecting through Shinjuku station to visit the Sanrio Puroland (Hello Kitty land). It's far cheaper than taxis which can easily run you $40 to $50...each way.3. Nice Executive LoungeIf you can get booked on an executive floor, you get access to the 17th floor Executive Lounge. They didn't really check our room number often, so I wonder if others could have snuck in. But the best part of the lounge is the daily breakfast buffet. Selection is quite good with both Japanese and Western style food. One of the most notable aspects was the freshly squeezed juices. Fresh fruits, pastries, eggs, congee, oatmeal, juices...everything your heart desires. It's a great way to start the day on a good foot. The views from the lounge are nice as well.4. Impeccable ServiceJapan in general provides the most polite and thoughtful service of any place I've been in the world. Of course, the Westin would continue that tradition. From Service Express to the concierge to the doormen to the bellboys/bellgirls...every interaction was pleasant and competent.5. Quiet AreaThis particular Westin is located in the Meguro/Ebisu district of southwest Tokyo. It's a bit off the beaten path, 15 minutes south of Shibuya, 30 minutes from Shinjuku or the center of the city. But it's a quiet area away from the hustle and bustle of skyrises. It looks to be a high income area based on the looks of the residents walking around. I found it to be a welcome respite from the city.6. Not so Comfy BedsUnfortunately the beds weren't quite to my liking. The sheets were rustling and loud. The top comforter was heavy. The existing pillows were flat. I requested a foam pillow which was much better. The mattress was a bit firm for me, but I'm sure others would find it fine. I realize that bed comfort is a personal choice, so YMMV.7. Decent Wifi and Power OutletsA pleasant surprise was the speed and consistency of the WiFi. Executive floor rooms have free WiFi with unlimited devices, and the speed was quite good for email, web surfing and even some light online gaming. Streaming audio via Spotify was a bit spottier, but still usable. I appreciated the two power outlets by the bedside lamp for charging of my phone.8. Nearby GroceriesWithin the basement of the nearby Yebisu Garden Place is a Familymart type store where you can buy bottled water, food, snacks, beverages, packaged fresh foods and more. The pharmacy on the main level (Tomas) has a wide assortment of medicine, but they are almost all in Japanese. NOTE: Japan does not sell Pepto-Bismol. Bring your own if that's your medicine of choice.9. Heated Toilet SeatsI've fallen in love with heated toilet seats and jet water sprays. Don't judge.10. Mysterious ThumpingThe one annoying downside to my stay was this regular thumping and loud noises that seemed to come from above me, no matter the time of day. At first I thought it was a guest, but it was too frequent and constant for that. I actually went up from our 20th floor to the 21st floor and found nothing out of the ordinary there. The sounds led me to believe it was from a service room or storage area. But another floor up on the 22nd are a couple of top notch restaurants (French and Teppanyaki). It's possible the sounds I hear are tables and chairs being moved around. Whatever it was, it was highly annoying.","Orange County, California","edyang</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County, California</strong>",77,5.0

We left Cerulean after finding out it was not family friendly at all, and faced extremely horrendous customer service. We were looking for another nice hotel option that would give true 5 star service while still being in a great location. The Westin in Ebisu delivered. I was traveling with my wife and 11 month old baby, and this hotel catered towards families. They offered nice large rooms, baby cribs, along with high chairs at the breakfast buffet. They were so warm and welcoming and had no problems with us bringing our babies to the restaurants, both lobby buffet along to the wonderful Teppanyaki restaurant upstairs.This might seem like standard service, since it basically is at every other SPG property I've stayed at, but after coming from the Cerulean where they didn't allow babies even at the breakfast buffet, the way Westin treated us, we felt right at home & really appreciated this even more. The hotel property itself is beautiful. Has a very nice comfortable lobby, and the restaurants were great. Their breakfast buffet was probably the best hotel breakfast buffet I've eaten at. The hotel design/decor had a nice classic European feel to it. The rooms itself were nice, clean, and great size. The rooms could use some updating, as it is one of the older Westin's I think I've stayed at, but still was very nice. The only amenity I wish they had that they didn't would be a swimming pool & hot tub to take our baby on a warm day. But being in a big city, it definitely wasn't a deal breaker. Some people complain about distance to the station, but we didn't find this to be a problem at all. The hotel is located right by a nice mall/shopping center, and there is a nice walking path that has the power walking ramps that speeds up the walk if you take those. Think it was only about a 7 minute walk. Really wasn't bad at all. The Ebisu station and mall had some cool shops/restaurants, plus the downtown area of Ebisu was nice and had a lot of good options there as well. I was actually here for work, and the office was in Shibuya, hence staying at Cerulean initially. However, it was just 1 stop from the Shibuya station on the JR line and I got to my office in about the same amount of time when I was actually staying in Shibuya. Being a loyal SPG member, I have to say, I've never had a bad experience with a Starwood brand hotel, and with that, I think this Westin gave my best experience to date. I will be back to Tokyo for work, and I'm happy to say I'll be booking the Westin again for my future travels.","San Francisco, California, United States","SeanW936</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California, United States</strong>",23,5.0

We choose Westin because I want to use SPG suite night award, and out of all the other SPG hotel in Tokyo, Westin has great trip advisor rating, located near JR/metro, and is near shopping mall. These are the reasons... But1. Westin is located ""near"" by Ebisu Station but it's quite a long walk if young ones aren't cooperating... It's around 10-15 min walk. Not all the walk is underground or cover with overhead so if rain you might be wet. 2. Shopping center is small and nothing much to buy for kids.. Overall Westin is still a good place to stay. Our room was upgraded to suite. Suite is very spacious and when traveling with kids, it's great to have separate living room and bed room. Kids tooth paste were provided too! The concierge was very helpful in providing us directions Breakfast at lobby (buffet) was better than at 22nd floor (forgot name of the restaurant) when you are with kids. There are variety of food in buffet restaurant, and my favorite is the noddle Two things I think Westin can be better is1. Kid's club- I know not all Westin has it, but I but it will be great 2. Offer more than 2 bottles of complimentary water... In other hotels we stayed at, usually the house keeping will provide extra bottles of water because they understand kids drink formula milk and uses up a lot of water. Maybe it's in Japan (?) that complimentary water is not common?, we stayed at Disneyland Hotel and no bottle water was provided.

This puts it within easy access of the train station that connects around Tokyo (station is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel, connected by walkways). Check-in was efficient and welcoming. My husband and I arrived about noon, before check-in time, but the desk personnel asked for a few minutes to secure a room for us. After about a 15 minute wait were were taken to our room. Room was comfortable, pleasant size, with good amenities. We had a view of Yebisu Garden Place. Since we were out and about most of the time, we did not use any of the Westin's restaurants, except one night we had drinks and a light meal in the Compass Rose lounge on the 22nd floor.

The lady who checked us in advised that I'd been upgraded but I can assure that there is no way the room assigned was an upgrade - it was the oldest, dated room that I have ever seen in this hotel, and in my mind most certainly a downgrade compared to the room I booked. Yes I understand that August is one of the busiest months of the year, but the hotel should at minimum respect the type of room booked, whether SPG platinum or not. In my mind, some manager thought they could deceive us as overseas tourists. When I called reception they then later offered a better room on the SPG floor. My everlasting memory of this hotel will be the attitude of the staff; only Saitomi-San, who worked in the executive lounge and at breakfast had a pleasant, happy demeanour; almost everyone else seemed like they were sentenced to hard labour in prison. I did have an accident in the room at this hotel, which was partly the hotel's fault and partly my own fault, however frankly the attitude of the management who handled it was very poor. I didn't expect anything except the management to at least check on the guests condition rather than leave a few chocolates from the lounge and a bar of L'Occitane soap in the room. Overall a great pity, but based on this visit I will never return.","Bangkok, Thailand","steveamcb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",239,3.0

I arrived around 4pm and checkin was prompt and courteous. The front desk assistant told me I had been upgraded to a slightly larger room, so it was nice to be appreciated as an SPG Platinum member. The room was not a suite this time, but still spacious and clean. The bed was super comfortable, the room and bathroom were exceedingly clean and the room smelled nice. What the room lacked was decent lighting. Even with all the lights on, it was still too dark inside the room. The other thing I did not like a lot about the room -- and this is a purely personal thing -- is the dated design. Carpet, furniture, furnishings and bathroom are old fashioned. This being said, everything in the room was spotlessly clean and I had excellent sleep quality. It was surprising to find out that I did not get turndown service and there was no complimentary fresh fruit in the room. These are things I always get at Starwood properties and I found it quite strange the Westin Tokyo did not offer that.As part of the SPG perks I was entitled to complimentary breakfast at the different breakfast venues throughout the hotel. I tried three of them. First one was Victor's, the upscale restaurant on the top floor. They offer a set menu for breakfast, from which I chose the steak and egg combo, with the bread basket. Quality of the food and the service were excellent, so I am giving top marks for this place. The breakfast buffet on the ground floor offers the typical things you would find at any luxury hotel. Quality of the food was good again and the service was it should be. At one point, a waitress had cleared my table when I was off to the buffet. This was a small mistake for which she apologised. The breakfast at the Executive Club on the 22nd floor was a bit of a letdown. The choice is disappointingly limited and this is the one venue I would not return to.The Westin Tokyo offers free ""Cocktail Hour"" from 5:30pm till 7:30pm at their Executive Lounge. The first afternoon of my stay I went and ordered a Mai Tai cocktail. They gave me a bit of an odd look, but eventually turned up with a Mai Tai. Things turned very weird the following day. I went back to the Executive Lounge, took a seat and... nothing happened. Not one single waiter came to me to ask what I wanted to drink. Only after 20 minutes had passed, somebody came to me to take my order. I asked for a Margarita cocktail and off went the waitress. After 10 minutes she returned and told me they could not make me one. I asked her then which cocktails they could offer and she told me ""Only gin tonic"". As it seemed odd to me that for an advertised ""Cocktail hour"", they only offered a gin tonic, I approached the manager Mr. Masaki Ikeno, who could only say ""Sorry"" and gave me his business card. I got quite frustrated by this and went down to the lobby bar where I got my cocktail eventually. I emailed Mr. Charles Jack, the hotel's GM with my remarks on the substandard service. As Mr. Jack was out of town, his assistant Mr. Yasunari Kaji spoke to me the next day at the Executive Lounge. He apologised for what happened and told me they were retraining their staff. Still I think if you pay that amount of money for a hotel room, guests should get correct service without having to resort to contacting management.One morning I asked the front desk attendant if I could go for a swim. She told me the hotel does not have a pool, that guests can use the pool at Ebisu Garden Palace for a slight fee. That slight fee turned out to be 2500 JPY for a swim, which I found totally unacceptable. Even though a five star hotel should have its own pool, I can understand the Westin does not have one due to historic reasons. Still charging guests for pool use seems ludicrous to me. I mentioned my objections as well to Mr. Yasunari Kaji, who gave me two complimentary entry tickets to the pool. Unfortunately by then I had other things to do in the morning, so I could not use those tickets.The other annoying issue I had was with the use of outside space. There is a patio at the hotel, linked to their restaurant. One morning the weather was fine and I asked the concierge if I could use the outside space to do some work outdoors on my laptop. She told me I could go to the public park across the street, which once again was totally unacceptable to me. I did not want to argue or complain anymore, so I just left and took a mental note of the reply I got.Wireless internet in my room seemed to be iffy, cutting out frequently, particularly during the last two days of my stay. I had to resort to using the 4G on my phone in order to get internet access.All things considered I was not overly impressed with my stay at the Westin Tokyo. On the positive side, the room was very clean and quiet and the breakfast service at Victor's and the buffet was excellent. However, the many glitches I encountered during my stay and the fact that I had to complain to higher management before anything was done about it, made the Westin one of the less memorable Starwood properties I have stayed at. Considering they charge 300 USD a night for a basic room, they really should clean up their act and match the level of service that is provided at so many other luxury hotels. They also need to realise that there is an awful lot of AirBnB properties in the exact same neighbourhood, which provide clean and quiet rooms for less than a third of what the Westin charges. If this hotel wants to distinguish itself from a typical AirBnB place in the same neighbourhood, it can only do so by providing top notch service to their guests. This is where the differentiating factor and the price difference becomes justified. If that does not happen, I really do not see the point in shelling out an additional 200 USD a night.",Belgium,"USATravellerBelgium</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Belgium</strong>",64,3.0

Also there are shops, restaurants and a beer museum (with tasting area) outside the front entrance of the Westin.The sushi restaurant in the Westin is just OK- but the Chinese restaurant is one of the best in the city. Breakfast buffet in the lobby level restaurant is very good and offers a wide assortment of foods. There is a comfy bar on the lobby level as well on the 22nd floor with great views.Also- there is a great workout room and the spa offers facials/massages and has a very nice hot tub and water lounge area.

We had booked the luxury spa suite for our treatment and weren't even allowed to use the bronze tub which they so heavily advertise - major let down! Also, hated that the nicest restaurant and lounge not only allowed smoking, but left a lingering smell throughout the entire venue. I understand that when in Tokyo, you'll encounter a lot of indoor smoking, but at least mitigate it at a luxury property. Had we not utilized a reward night for the stay, I'd be extremely in lieu of just disappointed.

It has a Mitsukoshi department store, Starbucks, a Joel Robuchon restaurant (we loved the bakery on the basement floor!), and local markets on weekends.The only disappointment we experienced was the Compass Rose bar on the top floor, which allowed smoking. We liked the great views from the bar and the drinks were good, but as non-smokers we really couldn't sit for more than 30 minutes.

I chose to stay here because I could get some of the nights we needed for SPG points, but I would certainly stay again on my own dime if I were to return to Tokyo. The location was great as a base for seeing the city because of the close proximity to the Ebisu station, which has both subway and local rail connections. This hotel is sumptuously decorated, but it doesn't feel overdone. Our room (an upgrade) was large by Tokyo standards and had plenty of room for all three of us. The bath was large, with a tub and separate shower. The beds, even my son's rollaway, were comfortable. I only ate at two of the hotel's many restaurants, but both were quite good. The Terrace has a great breakfast buffet (I'm not normally a fan of these), which includes Western and Japanese offerings. The same restaurant also has an impressive dinner buffet, though the price is a bit steep. The Chinese restaurant on the second floor is first rate in quality of the food and service, thought it is also quite expensive and the portions are small by the standards of even upscale American Chinese restaurants. One thing the Westin lacks is an informal restaurant where one can grab a quick bite. However, one can get burgers and some other lighter items from room service, which we did on several occasions. It was always prompt and the food arrived warm. The service in the hotel was almost uniformly excellent. The concierge helped us with restaurant reservations in advance of our arrival. Unfortunately, the recommended sushi restaurant was a disappointment. They were unable to get us reservations a number of places we mentioned, and we wish they had just told us we hadn't requested early enough rather than substitute an inferior alternative.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","Nearleft</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</strong>",21,5.0

My deluxe room was very spacious with a dressing table and mirror so I didn't have to crowd the work desk with my cosmetics. The bathroom had a separate shower and bathtub which really is the way to go. My reservation rate came with breakfast, which was alright. My only real complaint is that on Saturday morning they were clearly operating on a full house because there was a snaking queue at the breakfast restaurant.

Here is my Top 5 List of why I will stay at the Westin Tokyo again.1. Hotel/Rooms- The hotel does not look like a traditional Japanese hotel which is usually more minimalistic. The Westin Tokyo looks like a luxurious European hotel with a beautiful grand staircase and lots of rich wood and beautiful floor tile. The rooms are very large by Tokyo standards and luxuriously appointed like the hotel. 2. Service- I’ve always had great service at this hotel. I wanted a view of the Tokyo Tower on the Club Floor and it wasn’t available when I checked in. The front office manager, Takeshi, was able to get one of the best rooms on the Club floor the next day. It was a little bit of a pain packing and moving but it was worth it. The concierge service is also very good. I’ve stayed at other Tokyo Japanese owned hotels where the concierges don’t speak much English. This is a big plus at the Westin Tokyo.3. Breakfast at the Terrace and Club Floor Lounge- As a Platinum Starwood member, I was able to have breakfast at the Terrace restaurant buffet. This is a very extensive buffet with an omelet bar, freshly squeezed juices, smoked salmon, daily fish, dim sum, noodle bar, salad bar, fresh fruits, miso soup, pancakes, waffles, and a ton of desserts. The Club floor also has breakfast but the Terrace is far better. The Club Floor Lounge also has Happy Hour every night from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm which includes Yebisu beer, wines, and other alcohol. In addition, there was soup, edamame, cheese and crackers, pasta, and desserts. Also the lounge has an outstanding view of the city including the Tokyo Tower .4 Location- Ebisu is a quieter and more residential area of Tokyo but there is lots of action near the Ebisu train station. Some of my favorite restaurants are close to the Ebisu train station and don’t forget to try the Yokocho (across the street from the McDonalds) which is an indoor alley with over 20 Japanese restaurants. I do admit that the 10 to 15 minute walk to the train station even with the moving walkway does get tiresome every day but every hotel has a tradeoff.5. Price- The Westin Tokyo is priced very competitively and is usually way cheaper than other 5- Star Tokyo hotels.","Los Angeles, California","Mike D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",63,5.0

As an SPG gold member, I know what service should look like. I also know what else is on offer in Tokyo as I visit every quarter. Know this:Service sucks. Example: I arrived at 10PM and discovered all their restaurants were closed. I then asked if I could have room service (which was still available) deliver to the bar and was told repeatedly NO. Not possible. The client is always wrong at this hotel!Tacky & tired. This is a hideous building inside and out. Think 1970s Vegas and you'll get the picture. Godzilla is the only one who should stay here - and knock it down. Terrible locationBusiness people should avoid as it is near nothing. Tourists as well since it is near nothing.

However, the first response was slow and thereafter I haven't heard back from them at all. Until check in my view and expectation of the trip changed 369 degrees. I was so lucky to met the sweetest and loveliest Aye Mon at the front desk, she had the warmest smile and bubbliest personality. As it was pouring rain in Tokyo and we came dropping wet from the famous Tsujiki fish market, we were looking to just store our luggage first and borrow some umbrellas to visit nearby parks until the standard check in time. Mon was so hospitable and had the most understanding empathy to be so kind as to extend the gesture to help us find a room to go in and change from our wet clothes. We didn't even have to ask, but the effort of her trying to find us a sanctuary was all it counted, this is the kind of hospitality I am always WOW-ed by.Most hotels have problems of hot water running out by the end of a shower, but this one's a strong and steady one. I was able to enjoy a long and reviving hot bath after a long day of walking and exploring the city.The view from the room is also spectacular, thank goodness the sky cleared up by the time we headed back to our room after dinner at Shibuya, and was able to see the gobsmacking view of the beautiful Tokyo Tower. Thank you Mon!If you want to get lost in a city, Tokyo is the one to let your wildest adventure buds run free. Transpiration is so convenient and all the food are so yummy, just bear in mind lots of walking takes place! And if you are at Westin Tokyo, do remember to stop by front desk to visit my favourite - Mon! Maps, insider tips, additional information that she didn't have to but wanted to provide just to help me... she's got it all!

Buffet breakfast downstairs was of a good spread, with efficient staff. It deserves but doesn't receive five stars for one reason alone - I didn't get my king bed. Which is still fine, provided the two queen beds in my room are truly queen. Unfortunately, even the ""queen"" is more of a ""super-single"".

Once you get off at the Ebisu stop you'll follow the signs to Ebisu or Yebisu Garden Skywalk. Once the skywalk ends you can exit to street level and walk south through the mall area to the hotel or walk under the mall if it's raining by taking the stairs just to the left of the exit. Both ways have signs directing you to the Westin. Tokyo's Limousin Bus line so convenient for travelers also picks up and drops off at the Westin. The area is lovely and the mall is great for high end shopping. It is not however indicative of Japanese culture. It felt like being in a very nice area of the US. The hotel is huge with a large western style lobby and rooms. You still get a shower toilet and a beautiful garden is on the grounds. The toilet in our room was so load every time you sat on it- lasting for about 2 minutes after getting up- that I thought it was broken. They fixed it while we were out, but it still seemed crazy load after that. This is not indicative of any of the other shower toilets we've experienced and might have been particular to that toilet, but it was annoying enough for me to lower the hotel's score. There were also banging sounds and you could easily hear the family in the adjoining room (we had a corner room with a lovely view of Tokyo Tower).

We booked directly on the hotel website a few weeks beforehand and were able to secure an extremely competitive weekly rate at 280 a night with buffet bfast. Unheard of for Tokyo for a five star hotel with large spacious rooms in a prime location. We also had lounge access because of our Starwood status. Breakfast, tea and sunset canapés are served in the lounge which offers nice respite after a long morning or day of walking. Beautiful bright views of the city and Tokyo tower are viewed from the lounge.I love the Christmas spirit and decor at the hotel. The rooms are comfortable and spacious as well.

Cleanliness is never an issue in Japan and at the Westin is the same. Beds are comfortable and each room has a nice soak tub and separate shower stall. Service is great.Location is more neighborhoody which I love. The subway is a 10-15 min long walk away. Supermarkets and department stores are across the street. Service is excellent with fast response times. One negative is the concierge which missed the memo on holiday spirit and tend to suggest mediocre restaurants in the area even after repeated instructions that we did not want to stay in the area. Do your research before you arrive and ask them to make the reservations. I avoid asking for their suggestions which tend to be average and always nearby. We tried the coffee shop Japanese restaurant and Chinese restaurant during our stay. Skip the Chinese restaurant and coffee shop which is mainly buffet.

Like many gems, a few facets need polishing for enhancement. Wonderful, clean rooms and the service in the lobby bar is superb. The Compass RoseSky Lounge on the 22nd floor is a lost opportunity, however. With its commanding view of the Tokyo skyline, this could be a premier facility, but young & inattentive staff miss the mark. When we went to order a cocktail, we were told ""Oh, you're SPG"" in a dismissive tone and the regular menu was actually taken from our hands (quite a service faux pas), to be replaced with a dirty, water-stained limited one, lacking any beverage we preferred. After choosing one and then desiring to order bar food and additional cocktails, our party was ignored for 15 min. by a girl polishing glasses who refused to meet our gaze or give us the regular menu. It seems that SPG Gold and Platinum guests are somehow considered 2nd class, even though we are the brand's most loyal customers. The hotel's local wedding party catering seems to be superseding service to actual hotel guests. We informed the Compass Rose staff we were leaving and would go to the downstairs bar instead, due to lack of service or a menu. Connection to SPG and recognition of SPG guests can be a problem at some overseas hotels. Downstairs was a different story with great, highly trained staff of the first order. Some training is in order because properties should not be that uneven. Breakfast was good, but hotel guests were crowded out by day visitors. At Christmastime, throngs of the public crowd the hotel lobby to take photos at the tree; it’s wall-to-wall people. This is not a public park or fountain and impedes the guests and compromises hotel security. Lastly, security will need to be upgraded at this property and elevator key card access should absolutely be the norm for the elevators and guest floor access.

The Tokyo Westin is very beautiful in its décor. My daughter really liked that they had kimonos in the drawers as robes. That really made her feel special.There is a lovely garden and waterfall behind the hotel that is accessible via a stone pathway from the side of the hotel. The room had a nice view of the city and the bathroom was spectacular. As we were so busy getting out and about, we did not get a chance to use the pool or eat at the restaurants in the hotel. Just not enough time.Something to be aware of... the beds are not American-sized. The room had 2 beds, but they were smaller in size than our full beds by American standards. They are oversized twins. So our daughter had one bed and my husband and I shared one. We were close, but so tired from all of our walking that we really didn't notice. However, if you are big and/or tall in size you will notice. If you are a couple, then you will likely each use your own bed.Location wise, it is not in the heart of the Shinjuku district where all the fun stuff is, but everything is accessible via the subway or train.

Day one offered a small inconvenience, my wife and I were shown our room and we were surprised to find two single beds. The suggested solution ....we could push them together. Not the right answer folks.Staff were great although maybe the concierge could be a little more knowledgeable about ""things to see and do"" and helpful with regards booking things rather than simply handing out brochures and leaving the guest to figure it out.The hotel does not have a pool (which I found strange) but they do have an arrangement with a nearby facility if a guest wants to swim. The issue is there is a 2,500 yen per day for the privilege which is expensive if you want to go do your laps. so 5,000 yen for my wife and I to take a dip. Note to management. The cost is not published so if you really feel you need to charge your guests for a facility that the vast majority of hotels in your category have onsite for free it is only fair to inform them before they ask where to pool is ie on your web site.Since we had a late flight out of Tokyo we checked out at normal time, left our bags in the care of the hotel (thank you) with a view to collecting them later. We asked if there was a shower we could use to freshen up before we went to the airport and there was another charge.

But it is certainly not. You can check all my other reviews. I almost always say something good about places I've been to. This is an equally honest review. I would have given a zero rating if I could. [I'm finalising this review at 228 am - because I still can't get to sleep. I started writing this piece at 108 am. Anything in ""[ ]"" below are added just now - after I've gone downstairs to complain. That didn't help as I'm even more annoyed now]. I'm writing this having checked into the hotel yesterday afternoon. I'm writing this after having been woken up by a hotel staff about 30 minutes ago. I'm writing this because I cannot get back to sleep [and I still can't after another 90 minutes. Because I'm so angry. Because my whole family is now awake. [My daughter is still awake - as I am adding this bit in]. And I need to wake up at 7 tomorrow am [and therefore can't take sleeping pills as I can't afford to oversleep.] I've never written a review before checking out of a place. I'm doing this to make sure I get all the facts right.This is not the first time I stay at this hotel. I've stayed here few times before. Mostly very pleasant. In fact - I would always stay here when I'm in Tokyo if they have room available. I might have even given it a good review before. If there is any way I can remove that / them - I would. Background - we took two rooms. A connected set of rooms. Kids in one room - my wife and I in the other. Doors between the 2 rooms were opened during the incident. The call from the hotel staff [@0043 - as I was told by the staff when ""I"" went downstairs to complain] was supposed to be in reaction to a call from the guys downstairs - to the kids room. [I was told the complaint was made @0035]. Apparently the complaint was that there were running noises coming from the kids room. My kids have been in bed for at least 45 minutes and there shd have been little to no movement except for my son going to the toilet and my wife checking on the kids. This is past midnight. Important fact.To make things worst - the call from the hotel was made to the kids room - so they got woken up - and are still awake right now. In fact - there were two calls. The first one I needed to run over to their room to pick up and I missed that call. I was in bed myself in the next room. The second one I picked up [Sorry Westin - you made me do it - I needed to ""run"" to pick up - I really didn't want my kids to wake up].In fact my kids got very scared of the phone ringing in the middle of the night. Has anyone seen the Japanese film 午夜兇鈴 (the Ring)? One pays a fair sum for a decent night sleep DO NOT expect to get woken up in middle of the night. Not for something completely uncalled for. There is no point of investing in and advertising you have great and comfy beds - when guests get waken up in the middle of the night.Did the hotel management check if indeed there was noise? [They said they did and ""apparently"" hung around outside our rooms for 10-15 minutes - NOTE the timings stated above of the complaint and the calls I received - and draw your own conclusion]. They could have come upstairs and listened at the door and they would realise there was no running. [When I confronted them just now - they said there was ""talking"" - so even talking is not allowed in this hotel. My goodness. The talking wld have been between me and my wife. Even if there was talking - it was not loud. I can guarantee there was no shouting between me and my wife tonight. Just ordinary talking at ordinary voice level].I'm almost 100 percent sure they did not check. If they did - I would not have received the call. [I asked why they called and not knocked at the door instead if they were outside my room. They said it would have been rude had they made a call. And from that I assume their conclusion / training was that would not be rude to call and wake up my entire family]. Or this building is so flimsily built that even tip toeing can be heard. And house rule is you cannot talk with your wife.Or could the footsteps heard be caused by other phenomenon???????In fact, I'm so angry and will go downstairs to complain now. [I did - and the bits in ""[ ]"" are what I added just now after confronting the manager on duty].","Hong Kong, China","248sammyl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",59,1.0

We arrived on a Sunday evening and were quite tired after a long day of travel. Check in was quick and efficient and with SPG Platinum status were upgraded to a room on the Club Level and advised of our benefits. Platinum breakfast was offered in both the club lounge or in the buffet restaurant on the first floor.The room was very nice with a good sized bathroom including a full separate shower with both a rainfall showerhead and a second detachable head. There was a full tub, a Toto equipped toilet and a nice sink area. The rest of the room was well equipped with a coffee maker, water heater for making tea, a sitting area, a desk with hard wired internet connection (wifi also available), and a Westin Heavenly bed.The lounge on the 17th floor offered a decent but not overly impressive breakfast. We ate here on Monday morning, which was a holiday in Japan. We had first gone down to the lobby but noticed there was a long queue to get into the lobby buffet restaurant. Apparently this is a regular problem on weekends and holidays at this hotel and the Westin Tokyo should consider opening the outside seating and perhaps expanding the restaurant in the future.On Tuesday morning we had breakfast in the lobby restaurant. It was less busy and a big step up from what was offered in the lounge. I would definitely recommend trying to eat downstairs whenever possible.Service was universally excellent in the hotel from the front desk staff, to the bell persons, to the lounge and restaurant staff, as well as the concierge. Everything was super clean and well maintained.

Westin is located in a more quiet location called Meguro, a good place where you can really wind down after a long day out. Let's start with accessibility, Ebisu JR and Metro is located around 10mins walking(with the help of travelators) distance away. Access is thru B1 of the hotel and the whole journey is covered. So even if it rains you won't get wet. Shibuya and Harajuku Stations are just 1 to 2 stops away.There are plenty of restaurants around the hotel, you would pass through a few of them walking to the JR/Metro Stations. There is even more restaurants and shops in the station building itself. So affordable food/meals are nearby.Rooms are pretty spacious, staffs' service is excellent, even help us book a great Kobe Beef restaurant(also reviewed here called Hakushu) 1 week before we arrive. If you have club lounge access, check it out at night, on the extreme right you would be able to see Tokyo Tower. Club lounge has good enough spread for breakfast, we had ours there for 4 days and the kids never complain about getting bored with the food. There is no age restriction in the lounge so kids are allowed. Overall a great stay in Tokyo. When coming in from Narita/Haneda there is a limo bus service from the airport that takes you to this hotel. So if you are travelling with heavy luggage forget about the trains and save yourself some trouble. Estimated travel time from Narita is close to 1.5-2 hours depending on traffic.

Every wake up call on time, prompt service for all of our needs - well done. Housekeeping was ""spot on"" perfect as well. They respected the ""Do Not Disturb"" requests and were always available when we needed them. They also did a great job. Well done! The happy hour for the Platinum guests is wonderful and the Breakfast Buffet at the property was impressive as well. Finally, the hotel is perfectly located right outside the Ebisu Station, which takes you virtually everywhere throughout Tokyo. There are many great restaurants right next to the hotel as well (including Lawry's Prime Rib). We had our bags shipped ahead of us to our next destination (Kyoto Westin) and Mohammad not only handled that for us perfectly, but also assisted us throughout the stay with a variety of our requests. Thank you Mohammad for making our stay so perfect. You were a great help. The Concierge at this hotel ""stole the show"". They were all great, but most notably Ai Watanabe. Ai can only be described as a ""lovely breathe of fresh air"". You will really enjoy working with her. She has a vast knowledge of the entire hotel as well as the City of Tokyo. I believe she was at the front desk before becoming a Concierge. I have no doubt she will run a Starwood property in the future, if that is what she wants to do. I have a hobby that is shared by a gentleman from Tokyo. We had discussed our mutual hobby a number of times via email through Google translate. We planned to meet while I was in Tokyo. The only problem was that I did not speak a lick of Japanese nor did my internet friend speak very much English. We made a plan to meet at the hotel. I asked Ai what alternatives I had with respect to my meeting. After all, I had no easy method to communicate with my internet friend. It just so happened that my early evening meeting with my internet friend was scheduled at the hotel for a time that Ai was just getting off work. Ai graciously agreed to essentially be our translator at our near two hour meeting! Again, she did this on her own personal time. Thank you so much Ai and I only hope that at some point in the future my wife and I can return the favor to you (perhaps one day in California where we reside). In short, our (11) night stay was near perfect in all respects. We look forward to returning to the hotel one day in the future. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.

The hotel itself is very modern and centrally located. The facilities are great and the extra bits you are given in the room like shower caps, mouth wash, hair brushes , shaving gel and razors are cute additions. There are nice restaurants about but we only managed to eat downstairs at the Spanish themed buffet, which was ok with desserts variety probably outweighing the western Spanish foods(they did have jamon but better off without) Price was relatively normal($80-90pp) considering where it is. We also had lunch at teppanyaki restaurant upstairs which we enjoyed a great deal as well. It is a bit treacky with small children though as japanese do not enjoy any above average talking volume, so we felt bad we had to shush our children even though they were just talking at normal voices and not yelling and being abnoxious. It's a bit of walk from hotel to the train station, but it's all connected between buildings. Trains are faster and a tad cheaper to move around. Taxis are expensive as expected.

The Terrace offers a nice breakfast buffet ($32 for adults, $20 for children) and ala carte dinner menu. Oddly, when we were there in June they had a Spanish buffet nightly for the month! So every night we were there was the same set of dishes, the same Spanish CD on, it was out of sync with the Japanese experience we would have liked.... typically a hotel may have a themed night but every day is unusual. The rooms are typically sized, two sinks and separate shower stall and tub. The housekeeping staff here is amazing; polite, thorough and efficient. They even take the shower head and drain cover out and clean them! Free water in room and wifi and a very helpful staff (from front desk to concierge) helped us to plan out our days. We were in town for a family vacation and the location of the hotel is out of the way; more suitable for corporate or group guests. We used starwood points and so had limited options. For a leisure trip, would stay elsewhere. There are few (if any) area restaurants or sights worth visiting without cab or train.

English is spoken all around so it almost feels like you are in a western country. the room is great; beds are comfortable. I would say the only issue would be the location; it's about 10-15 walk to the nearest station. comfortable walk by the underpass links with shops, etc. but we came home late one night and the shopping center had closed so we couldn't use our normal route, and the walk home was a bit tricky and long. taxi from ebisu station is about 800 yen.

While I absolutely loved the hotel - the room, service, and amenities were great - the location was unfortunately a major drawback for us. This is a great hotel if you are on a business trip, but if you are vacationing and want to explore Tokyo (which was our goal), this is probably not your best bet. The hotel is in Ebisu/Meguro and is probably a 10 min walk from the Ebisu train station. While this doesn't sound far, walking it several times a day gets old and fast. There's not much going on near the hotel or in Ebisu so you'll be using the train a lot! The one plus is the Ebisu station is one train stop away from Shibuya which is a main center in Tokyo.

Think lots of marble, and columns. It's not necceserily my style, but we weren't there to decorate. It's all well kept and clean with all the modern amenities you would expect from 5* hotel.

It's also two stops, or about 30 min easy walk from Shibuya, which is worth checking out.

I was torn between this location and Shinjuku (Hilton/Park Hyatt) and while I wanted to stay at the Park Hyatt, I'm so very glad my wife convinced me to stay at the Westin. If you haven't been to Tokyo, and you are traveling with little kids, there is no better option. The hotel is connect to the Mitsukoshi department store as well as the Yebisu Garden Tower which has several good underground restaurants as well as the high end restaurants on the 37th floor. There is also a Burger King so it's good for kids. There's a beer garden for the adults, just FYI. The nearest subway station is the Ebisu station and it is about a 10 minute walk from the Westin but it has people mover so the walk isn't too bad. More importantly, because you can go from the Westin to the station through the underground connection (directly from the elevator of Westin to inside the actual station) this is great for hot/raining/snowy/etc... whatever weather condition. the hotel is a little bit dated. The hotel also provides all the amenities that you can ask for but you can tell it's still holding onto its glory days of the 80's. That said, everything is clean and the rooms are kept extremely clean. The service is as expected of a Westin. They are professional and they provide you with everything you need. The best impression we received was from the bellhop and the concierge who went out of their way to provide our children with mini erasers (Japanese/Korean love erasers, pencils, stationary, etc) that the kids were thrilled. They also provide a coloring book with color pencils, which was awesome for the kids. As for the rest, there is nothing spectacular but also there is nothing else you'd need. The breakfast option in the lobby level is great if you are traveling with kids. It has all the usual continental options as well as the hot (omelet, scrambled, bacon, etc...) as well as a good Japanese option. My kids loved the rice and miso soup for breakfast. The BAD - As SPG Gold, we get breakfast for two but they do charge about $20 USD for children 5 or older. That in my opinion was not worth it. But considering we were visiting with our friends, we paid it and enjoyed the breakfast. As an alternative, you can use their executive lounge for breakfast (executive level rooms or SPG member upgrade) and they will not charge you anything for you and your family. The other ""bad"" of the property was that the staff wasn't the usual level of enthusiasm or energy. They were cordial but not the ""i'll take care of everything"" mentality of other higher end hotels. The rooms also had a lot to be desired. While we were upgraded to a corner king, the normal standard room is quite small for a family of four. There are suites available at the hotel but based on the prices, i don't think they would be worth it. I would stick with getting a king and trying for an upgrade to the corner king.The Ugly - well, there really wasn't anything there that constituted an ""ugly"" thing. I personally believe the decor was pretty bad and bordering ""ugly"" it does not rise to the level necessitating that connotation in this review. So, in short it's a great hotel for family stays but I wouldn't expect the level of detail oriented service you see at the Park Hyatt/Mandarin/Ritz/Conrad. But without such expectations, due to its location and convenience and the leisurely area surrounding the hotel, it is far better than trying your luck with Shinjuku area and having to deal with the mass of humanity that filter through that station as well as the nearby Shibuya station. I would stay clear of those two stations if you are with kids.","Beverly Hills, California","wilpwrr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beverly Hills, California</strong>",20,3.0

Second the hotel is located next to the Yebisu Garden Place where there are numerous shops and restaurants. The rooms are very spacious (which is rare in Japan, hence their high prices) and have all the possible amenities. It is also worth paying a little supplement to have a room in the higher floors with breathtaking view over the city with the Tokyo Tower and the Bay in the background. The hotel has several restaurants, which serve very high quality Japanese and Western food. The Yebisu Teppanyaki grill is a must and guests should not miss its gourmet dishes (meat and fish).

However those who would just like to eat sushi could also go to the restaurants of Yebisu Garden Place where they can get them at a very advantageous price.

The lounge is also worth checking out, as they offer a decent selection of finger food and imported and local alcohol.

Also, there are taxis always available - longest wait was probably 3 mins - so you don't have to worry about getting Uber (which doesn't work that great in Japan anyway). And if you get a room in a high floor with a city view you have a great view of Tokyo tower.You have a small gym to workout well equipped and not too crowded but if you're a runner definitely go for a run outside, they have maps with a 3mi loop which is great, and of course you can borrow the gear with the pack light program.My only comment is that this hotel doesn't look like a Westin but rather like a Ritz-Carlton, like a bit overloaded in decorations and not the sleek clean look of many Westins.All around a great hotel for business, if you're for vaca the staff at the concierge was very helpful so you can plan there too.","Seattle, Washington","CLinacre</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",4,4.0

Concierge helped us with some good restaurant recommendations, helped us with travel to our next hotel, and also helped us ship a little framed print we bought back to the states. Rooms are up to par. Is it the Park Hyatt? No. But it's not trying to be. And I much prefer the neighborhood, and it's less than half the price. Meets the expectations of an American style luxury hotel. Zero complaints. I want to spend more time talking about the neighborhood, Ebisu. Don't be fooled by the Meguro address. You will really want to spend your time in Ebisu. It's a great feel. Not too bustling but plenty of hip looking professionals (not the banker types you would see in Ginza) walking around during daytime work hours and fun bars at night. Lots of good food and so reasonably priced for such high quality. No use recommending restaurants. Just walk in anywhere. We stumbled into an Italian restaurant for lunch one day and it was all locals enjoying their lunch hour and super fresh tasty pasta and pizza. Special shout out to Ippudo ramen and Bikkuri sushi though. Pro tip: the Ebisu skywalk. Genius. Google maps might tell you you're equidistant between Meguro station and Ebisu station, but the Ebisu skywalk allows you to zoom to the station on moving walkways, directly to the East gate of the JR Ebisu station. We used the JR Yamanote line to experience other neighborhoods, and while we had fun taking in the bustle of for example Shinjuku station, Tokyo station, and the Shibuya crossing, we were so glad to come 'home' to our neighborhood each night where we could catch our breath. Few more pro tips for jet lagged Americans: Nothing opens until like 11am. We had breakfast at 7-eleven early when we couldn't sleep and went one morning to the Tsukiji fish market. International ATM located at the post office on the 3rd floor of the Yebisu garden complex. The Westin restaurant isn't bad (we had dinner there the first night because we were exhausted from travel and didn't want to go anywhere) but would recommend getting out as much as you can.

Our flight to Tokyo from San Francisco was delayed for over 10 hours. Instead of getting into Tokyo at 1pm, we showed up at 10:30pm. When I approached the front desk, they were so genuinely sincere and polite, it was very refreshing, especially after a long day of flying and being stuck in an airport. Our room was wonderful. We loved everything about it. It was clean, comfortable, spacious, and relaxing. We were on the 21st floor with amazing view of Tokyo Tower. We controlled the temperature in our room which was very pleasant. We had access to the Club Lounge. The hotel gave us a choice of eating in the Club Lounge or restaurant on the 1st floor for breakfast. We chose the restaurant on the 1st floor every morning and loved it. There was a great selection of food and the juices were very tasty. My wife and two sons were in heaven. We were visiting Tokyo for Spring Break. So, we spent our days sight seeing. However, at the end of the day, we always looked forward to going back to our hotel room. It was like a quiet oasis in the middle of a huge, busy, noisy city. The walk from the metro or JR station is very easy, especially with the moving walkways. The entire walk was basically covered. It was not a hard or difficult walk. In fact, we left the hotel with our luggage walking to the metro. It was no big deal.Even though we were on the 21st floor, we never had to wait more than 30 seconds for an elevator. The hotel was full, but it never felt like we were forgotten or just a number. Everyone at the hotel was very polite and always had a smile. With the hotel next to a department store, we would go down to the bottom floor a little before 7pm where they have a supermarket. Sushi and other items were on sale to sell immediately at the end of the day. It was a great way for my boys to enjoy an evening snack.The Club Lounge was great. It always had drinks. A nice plus is also the soups during the afternoons. Most Club Lounges just have sodas during the afternoon, but this Westin had bacon vegetable, potato leak, or some other tasty soup available to snack on. Again, my sons were in heaven.We loved everything about this hotel....the staff, the room, the lounge, the breakfast, and the location. We would head back to this hotel in a heartbeat.

Not only at the front desk, but all staff including cleaners and kitchen staff...quite refreshing for a big international hotel.I chose the hotel, because of the Metro and JR Line stations nearby. Ebisu station is about 5 minutes walk away and can be reached under cover (handy for rainy Tokyo days). From here you can use the Metro or JR Line. I also used Meguro station, which is an easy 10 minute walk from the hotel, which gives you more access to the brilliant Tokyo rail network.What was a nice surprise is the area that the hotel is located in. It is opposite the 'Ebisu Garden Place' which is a mall and restaurant area containing lots of Japanese and Western restaurants. A short walk through walk through Ebisu's pretty streets will take you down to the Meguro riverside walk (popular in cherry blossom season).If I'm travelling back to Tokyo I'll definitely stay in this hotel again.","Steyning, England, United Kingdom","Nigel W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Steyning, England, United Kingdom</strong>",3,5.0

I went downstairs and asked the front desk for a pass - they tried to charge me the equivalent of $27 USD for a day pass to this gym (the last time the pass was free but this was over two years ago).

Reception at check in was very cold and not welcoming at all, likewise when I tried to use concierge the lady seemed put out that she needed to help me. The one positive is the staff in club lounge continue to be great although if you want a seat during cocktail hour make sure you are there before start time at 5.30pm otherwise you'll be standing and feeling very awkward. Made my reservation on the basis of club room access to a very good out sourced gym (the one in hotel is tiny), which was confirmed at time of booking. When arrived at hotel was told this relationship had ceased and if I wanted to use the gym it would cost me 3,500 yen each visit. No apology offered or given the circumstance exception was made.... again thought very bad service.Breakfast was noticeably poorer from previous visit. I have just completed stays at Westins in Cape Town and Bangkok and with these hotels charging half the room rate of Westin Tokyo they provide a breakfast that puts Tokyo to shame.

It is very convince. The Ebisu JR station is about 8-10 minutes walk but you went through stores and walkaway so you barely realise it took that long. The Hotel is very beautiful. The lobby is very nice and grand. We booked the room with the lounge privileged. The room is big even for regular standard not only Japanese standard. The bathroom also very nice with separate bath and shower. They give you bath salt that smell very nice. The water pressure and the warmness of the water also great. The air conditioning works perfectly and gets very cold (some hotel in Japan control their Air Conditioner so it can't go below some point and it is a big deal for me to have cold room). The lounge is very nice. They offer you free drink at night and the food selection also good. We also tried the gym. So Westin has 2 gym. One is in the hotel itself and the other on is in the mall that connected to the hotel. The gym called Grancise if Im not mistaken. Because i pick the club room i got privilege to go to Grancise. The gym in Westin is ok, few equipment, nothing really special. The Grancise one is really nice though. They have the golf simulator, indoor pool, weights, equipments, cardio. So that was really cool. Only just to remind some people. They have a very strict non tattoo rule in Japan for gym and sauna. My husband has tattoo but he is able to cover it up with long sleeve when working out... still its weird for them to have that rule. As for breakfast. It is pretty complete... I have to say that i have been to other Westin hotel that offer better breakfast though (Westin Kuala Lumpur). But this one is pretty good. Only on the second night. The morning we check out... Take them so long to sit us out even though it is empty inside... i think they need better system to sit down people for breakfast. Other than that I'm very happy with my choice of hotel while I'm in tokyo and i will be staying here again if i come back.I highly recommended you get the club room...

The rooms are huge and so are the bathrooms, lots of closet space, a shower and a large bath. It location is really ideal, especially for such a long trip. The Ebisu station is a 5 minute walk, and can be done completely underground if the weather is bad. There are a lot of really great restaurants across the street from the hotel, a grocery store, multiple coffee shops and a Michelin star restaurant. The gym at the Westin is pretty decent, it’s something that’s important to me and I couldn’t get a grasp on what it was like before I got here…but anyone else concerned about the facility, it has; treadmills, stairmasters, elipticals, bikes, free weights, medicine balls, weight machines and lots of other little things. It was a pleasant surprise. I got a massage today at the Spa, and although very overpriced (as per usual at the Westin) it was great. The Spa had a steam room, whirlpool, showers and lots of nice facial products for use. My only complaint about the Spa is that to use the facilities without a service costs 2000 yen…I’ve visited many other Westins where the use of the steam room and sauna are generally free, so this is a shame.My only other real complaint about this hotel is The Terrace restaurant. The lunch and dinner buffet is “USA buffet” theme and it’s just terrible. It’s too bad because usually after a long day of work I like to hit up the buffet but I can’t handle it here. It’s a hack job on “USA” food, which isn’t good to begin with and I forced myself to try it twice and both times was so disappointed. The other restaurants in the hotel are super expensive and not worth the cost, but not bad options if you’re tired and hungry. Especially Mai, the sushi is good but not worth the cost.

It may have helped that I am SPG Gold, but my daughter and I had a spacious, clean room with a view of Mount Fuji and the City of Tokyo. Bathroom spacious and clean. The staff was extremely attentive. The gym was small (and if we went early it was crowded, with steamed-up windows), but when not overly-busy it was perfectly adequate and offered a good view through a wall of windows. No pool. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas, and has a lounge for tea/dessert/after dinner drinks, plus a regular bar and a casual restaurant on the first floor. The top floor has another bar (extremely full of cigarette smoke the night we attempted), a Japanese restaurant, and a French restaurant. We had a good experience one night at the Japanese restaurant sushi bar -- even though I felt sort of guilty for eating in the hotel, it is not the same experience as in the US. The sushi chef was fun to interact with, and everyone else in the place was Japanese.The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the Ebisu station, where you can access both the subway and JR Tokyo lines. En route, you pass a branch of the Mitsukoshi department store, if you're having a luxury brands jones, as well as a Dean & Deluca in case you just can't stand another morning without a good old US-style muffin. However, speaking of breakfast, the buffet at the Westin is outstanding, with a wide offering of Japanese and Western foods. It's a little expensive at Y3500 per person, but if you buy your tickets at check-in they will charge you less.

The hotel itself is lovely. Modern and clean, the rooms are thoughtfully designed and I had a great view of the park and Tokyo Tower. The room was SERIOUSLY quiet. I never heard noise in the hall or from the rooms next door. There is a building under construction next door and even that wasn't very loud. It seemed to start at 9 am and end by 5 pm. A lot of reviews here mention how quiet the neighborhood is, and how easily accessible the train is. I didn't realize it's a completely covered 7-8 minute walk, so if it's raining, you can get to the JR and the Metro without being outside. The reviews don't seem to highlight all the restaurants next door. Probably about 20 of them, from Starbucks all the way to casual places and fancy places. Plus the food hall in the basement of Mitsukoshi next door. (Also accessible underground.)There's also a really good wine store just past the hotel exit on the basement level. The food in the Westin was pretty good too. The breakfast buffet was really good, and the service was efficient and friendly. I also ate at the teppanyaki place on the top floor, which was very good. And yes, a bit expensive but not outrageous. Most important to note - the service From check in to the concierge to the bellmen. Even the housekeeping staff.

The concierge is quite amazing - they will really go the extra mile to sort out your reservations at restaurants and events before you arrive.Rooms are large - especially by Tokyo standards - and spotlessly clean. The beds are nice and comfortable. Wifi is fast and reliable.Good access to public transport. Both Ebisu and Meguro stations are 10 minutes' walk away - both are major stations on the subway network with access to multiple lines - including the all-important Yamanote line. There is covered access to a shops and restaurants from the basement... all the way to Ebisu station. And almost always a long line of taxis waiting at the cab rank.Basically this is a great hotel in a great sophisticated area which is quieter than the tourist hotspots of Ginza and Shibuya - yet directly linked to both by subway.

The view from our room was fabulous, with a great view of Tokyo Tower. We tried both the breakfast in the restaurant on the lobby floor and in the lounge and would recommend the restaurant for its variety. The food is excellent though could benefit from some more made-to-order items. The hotel has a nice small gym and offers access to a large gym and pool right next door. The subway and JR trains are a short and nice 10 minute walk away (als underground if you wish through a shopping mall), there is a nice shopping mall next door (with both a grocery and a basement food hall), and Michelin-starred Joel Robuchon has two restaurants across the street if you are so inclined (reserve two weeks in advance).

Bell desk was really helpful and they were more than happy to accommodate my request.The next day, I got there an hour before check in and the front desk managed to get me into my room early ( so there was no waiting around).

Shower was powerful and the room was quiet.The views were beautiful, I had the view of Tokyo Tower.Unfortunately the spa wasnt open as it is undergoing refurbishment and if you want to use the pool, it is outside of the hotel.For dinner I dined at Mai within the hotel. I had phoned ahead and the staff said they cater for Vegetarians. I am not sure if its coincidence or not, but when I got to the front of the restaurant, the menu was open to the Veg page.I was travelling on my own, but the staff were lovely and the lady helped me choose what to eat and what to drink ( please try the sake, it tasted divine). The food was well presented and tasted delicious. The veg tempura was so fresh and the sushi was a great way to start the evening.I then visited the bar downstairs, only downside, is that people can smoke within the bar. This is normal in alot of Japanese locations. The bar had a relaxed ambience. The drinks were good.The next day, I checked out and jumped on the bus to the hotel. I recommend leaving plenty of time before your flight out of Narita. The bus stops at multiple hotels before heading to Narita.

Staying here for half a month, I have met both.On the day of check-in, the front desk staff was fantastic. The lady kindly accommodate my request for a room near the elevator and I was informed that my room includes free breakfast and I just need to show my card key sleeve for breakfast.On my first morning, I went ahead for breakfast but was shocked when they issued me a bill for it! I clarified with the staff at the restaurant and they brought me to the front desk to clarify. There I met the most unfriendly staff in my whole stay. The guy insisted that my room rate does not include breakfast and he gave me the kind of look as if I was trying to con a breakfast out of the hotel. After showing him my booking confirmation which clearly states that breakfast is included, he issued a coupon for my breakfast for the day but informed me that I won't be entitled for it for the rest of my stay. Seeing how unfriendly he is, I informed him that I will not pursue now but will email my booking agent and the hotel's room reservation to clarify on why there is a discrepancies between what is in black and white on my paper and his systems. Hearing that he then took out a stack of breakfast coupon and began issuing them to them. If he is so sure that my booking does not include breakfast, why did he do that after hearing that I will escalate this upward? The way he slammed the coupon on the counter as he issued them is seriously insulting to me as a guest in such a luxurious hotel.Breakfast on weekend is really horrible. The whole hotel is filled with wedding functions on weekend and the Q for breakfast is horrible! Having slept in late on a weekend, I headed down for breakfast at 10am and was shocked by a long queue filled with prettily dressed Japanese in kimonos and all. They definitely does not look like they have stayed here for the night. Asking the waitress if I had to Q since breakfast is ending in 30mins and I only need a table for 1, she rudely point to the Q and walked away. This made me felt that the hotel actually valued their locals who is going to pay for their breakfast other than those who have paid a bomb for the room and can't even get a breakfast in peace.Overall, the stay is good except for all the hassle relating to breakfast which is seriously a chore. My suggestion is that if you want to stay here, get it without breakfast. You seriously wouldn't want to go through those trouble to affect your mood during your stay.I have 10 more nights to go.

My husband had business in Tokyo over Thanksgiving last year and we decided to join. What a great choice the Westin was. It was all decorated for the holidays with a GIANT tree and trains and people were there getting married...all very festive. My son really loved all the fun decor and the AMAZING BIG breakfast. If you do the exec floor that is also a good call with kid in tow as sometimes kids are just too tuckered to go out to eat dinner and aren't that hungry so the snacks will do. Although it was extremely crowded at the hotel this time of year the service was very good. However breakfast was SOOOOO crowded it was less great than in past visits - make sure to leave time in the AM for you are bound to wait. We left for Hakone mid-stay and they were kind enough to hold our luggage and then re-unite us when we returned. The bus is very convenient to get to the airport by the way. It is the first stop on the route and you are guaranteed a nice seat but you HAVE to reserve the bus as they fill up. It is a long ride vs. the train BUT to get to the train you have to take the subway or take a taxi to Shinagawa so if you are traveling with more than carry on this is the way to go.

My wife has Platinum Status with Starwood so we were treated to a free breakfast either in the restaurant or in the exec lounge. We chose to eat in the restaurant for its greater choice. The breakfasts aren't as mind blowing as some reviewers suggest - the smoked salmon lacked flavour, the eggs (omelettes, poached, scrambled, boiled) always overcooked but the variety was excellent. I agree that the hotel isn't as modern as some suggest but this doesn't really mean it's dated it just adheres to a different style and ethos. Some my call it chintzy or gaudy but it is down to a matter of taste. The rooms themselves are perhaps nearing the time where they will need a refresh but they are in no way outdated or rundown. We stayed in 1619 and, once the distance mist had cleared after a couple of days, we were treated to an ace though distant view of Mt Fuji. Couldn't Westin have moved the mountain closer?! ;) We were only a couple of floors from the Exec Lounge which hosts a decent cocktail hour or two of canapes, drinks etc. If you're lucky enough to be there when the black forest gateaux is served, drive in. The view from there is pretty decent too especially when seen through the eyes of a couple of serve yourself G&Ts! One thing I would say though, the sparkling wine is revolting, stay away! I like to workout when on holiday and was concerned that the gym would be too small but if you know your way around a gym, there is enough to keep you buffed. I was offered on check-in the choice of using a larger gym nearby but in the end I did not want to waste my time in Tokyo looking for a squat rack for five days I could make do. Also took advantage of Westin Workout for my gym gear an absolutely superb idea. The alternative gym choice was offered by the platinum reception guy who came out from behind the desk to greet us when we arrived and again when we were leaving. I know exceptional customer service is trait of the Japanese but I still found every single member of staff in the hotel to go above and beyond every time we spoke to them. The staff are a real credit to the hotel. Finally, I note that there are some complaints about the distance from the train station to the hotel. It really isn't that far and I note that also that these complaints come in the most part from US guests. I can understand if you're not used to walking it is a bit of a trek but don't let that put you off staying in the hotel. It is in an excellent location for both exploring the great little places in Ebisu as well as Tokyo in general. The only time the really quite short and mechanically assisted walk from the station (there are travellators for Godsake!) may be an issue is if you have your suitcases. The Missus and I took the ""limousine"" coach from the airport on arrival so this wasn't an issue and took a taxi to Shinjuku when for the trainlink back to the airport at the end of our stay. In short, this is a great hotel in a great area..oh and of course you get your heavenly bed so you are guaranteed that wonderful Westin night's sleep","London, United Kingdom","PaulieV</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",19,5.0

It's a bit removed from the usual hustle and bustle of busy Tokyo that you find in other properties in Shibuya, Ginza or Shinjuku.While it is a bit of a distance to the Ebisu Station, the moving Skywalk helps a lot and we had no issues going back and forth between the station and hotel, on some days several times.

Room furnishings and carpet, even the bathrooms would have been amazing back in the 80s (which is what can be said of many of the older and larger hotels in Tokyo), however in this day and age, we would have been happy to sacrifice some of the space for some modern upgrades.SPG lounge is a nice touch - has a city view and the food is actually decent (which is more than can be said for some other Starwood properties - Hello Moana Surfrider).Concierge is okay at this hotel, some good recommendations, some really mediocre recommendations.

For Japanese standards, according to several colleagues who had stayed elsewhere during previous trips, this is a luxury hotel. For me, my first time to Japan, it was a great choice, especially compared to a couple other hotels I visited where others in my department were staying.The Westin is all about class. The care here is top-notch. There’s a general sense of civility and service throughout Tokyo and it’s at an extreme at this hotel. The moment I arrived, I was warmly greeted by the staff, each willing to help me carry my bag, open the door, assist with directing me to check-in, etc. There is no tipping here, so the behavior has no ulterior motive than to make the guest feel welcome. I felt extremely welcome. Check-in was a breeze, and the front desk clerk acted courteously and full of grace while asking for my credit card and passport. My efforts to reciprocate in simple Japanese were received with the utmost appreciation. All in all, it was an excellent first impression of this country I knew little about.My room, 1101, had two double beds rather than one king, but I was alone and one bed was plenty. Moreover, the room size was nowhere near matchbox size that people talk about as common in Tokyo. I had a full-length picture window to see the city skyline, a room thermostat, a desk with Ethernet cable, a make-up table with mirror that, not too surprisingly, I never used, a large Panasonic television that I never watched (too many films on my 13.5 hour flight from Boston), a large closet, complimentary water and rice cooker (I still don’t understand that one), and a bathroom fit for a king. In it, there was a near full length tub with metal handles for easy entry and departure, a separate high end shower stall with metal hand spray and top down shower nozzle, a sink, and a state-of-the-art toilet bidet combination that made me regret not having upgraded accordingly when I redid my bathroom earlier this year. Never had I tried such a contraption, but I was a big fan in no time! The cleansing water was self-directed and warm. Absolutely brilliant!The bed was a bit on the hard side for my taste, as if Westin was still adhering to the old philosophy that firm beds offered better support than plush ones. There were three foam pillows straight out of Goldilocks and the Three Bears – small, medium, and large. I always ended up with large and dumped the other two on the floor.In the morning, I took advantage of the breakfast buffet which was included in my rate. There, I enjoyed a potpourri of extravagant foods with similar cordial service. Highlights included strong café in a bowl with accompanying milk, a spinach, celery, and pineapple smoothie, pain au chocolat and croissants, muesli with dried fruit, omelet station, miso soup, pork bouillon with bacon, a collection of cheeses, smoked salmon, and dried fish, stir fried noodles, yogurt, and about a dozen other dishes.Westin Tokyo took about 1h20 to reach from Narita airport using the Narita Express train then changing for four more stops at Shinegawa station. That stop is about 10 minutes by foot from the hotel in an upper class area, accessible either through a path between buildings above ground or a commercial tunnel a la Montreal. There’s a nice mall with some great shops on the way, and on the other side of the Ebuis station, there are a number of great little restaurants that don’t cost much at all.Definitely recommend this hotel.",New England,"Cherry_Wonderdog</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New England</strong>",3416,5.0

The staff is superb- they truly embody the spirit of Japanese hospitality. Nothing is too much to ask and they never seem to be overwhelmed. They are friendly and enjoy getting to know their guests personally.In addition to the great staff, the rooms are excellent. For Tokyo, they were quite spacious and well appointed. The rooms seemed newly refinished and well maintained. Excellent view of Tokyo Tower and the downtown. As a nice perk, they have the softest yukata (Japanese robe) in the rooms. I tried to find one as soft in stores and I couldn't.The location is good- it's not downtown, but their are two nearby subway stations. One of which- Ebisu- is on a JR line for tourists with a JR Rail Pass. Their are always taxis too. It's an upscale residential neighborhood, so their are plenty of restaurants, convenience stores etc nearby. They have a lovely garden in the back of the hotel.Try the breakfast- it was a wonderful spread of both western and Japanese options.

Japanese breakfast was absolutely stellar, even in the SPG breakfast room. There is a bit of a language issue with the front desk staff. The concierges were great, but the front desk staff should be much more fluent in English. The Japanese people loathe saying no, or not being able to please you, but in the end honesty is better than politeness. We bought some pastries in the hotel bakery (delicious) and had them boxed up, so they could be placed in our friend's room when they checked in. Seems simple enough. The front desk seemed to understand and agree to this, but somehow mucked it up. So our friends check in, nothing in their room. The next day we tried to find out what happened and it took FOREVER, only to yield that the box of pastries, now 24 hours old, was in the bell storage area. Then they tried to deliver those. We said they were old and needed to be replaced. The entire thing took hours of conversations, really ridiculous, until finally they replaced them and still couldn't manage to deliver them. Day 3 our friends asked for the package, and it was at the front desk.

But if you're looking to also get a feel for Tokyo, I'd recommend looking elsewhere as there appears very little 'neighbourhood' around it: in fact directly opposite is a faux French chateau specialising in weddings and an Italian restaurant - and just beyond that a very bland mall. Certainly we had a better experience as travellers in terms of proximity to local restaurants and street activity at another time staying in the Shiba Park district. From a service perspective, our experience at the Westin was not great (I won't re-live it here)and although ultimately our concerns were resolved, it is apparent that chaos ensues when large groups (such as multiple wedding parties) arrive. Although clean and functional, the décor does need modernising and rather surprisingly the lifts do not have a security swipe system to ensure appropriate floor access. I wouldn't say 'don't do it' - after all, it is perfectly functional - but I really think you can do better.","Melbourne, Australia","SharonaA88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",10,3.0

We have been in our SPG floor room for a few days, and it has been a nearly perfect stay. I live the bed (very firm), the bathroom is efficient & pretty, and the view is spectacular. There is an underground walkway that leads to the Ebisu Station (puts you minutes from any place you'll need to get to!). The only criticism I have is about a promotion through SPG. If you dine in the hotel, and you use your SPG Amex card, you're supposed to get 15% off your food tab. I've been dining and not seeing the discount, so I asked at the SPG desk. They were gracious, however, now I've had to take a few calls and messages. I've been sent back to the restaurants with my card to beg for the discount, but the manager wasn't there. So, now I am told to wait for yet another phone call that will allow me to run back down to the restaurant to again beg for my discount. Really? This is not professional, and I expect better from SPG as well as Westin. Ideally, this would have been corrected internally...as it is a Westin promotion, not to mention that I am supposed to be enjoying my vacation, not running around correcting the hotel's mistake.","Newburgh, Indiana","Braden2006</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newburgh, Indiana</strong>",28,4.0

I was very impressed with everything about this hotel, the service was top notch, the room was quite large with a couch (not that we used it) and very comfy bed. The bathroom which is always a key point for a hotel room in my mind was also well sized with a fancy Toto washlet toilet and separate shower and tub. I was especially impressed with the water pressure in the shower and the smartly designed rain shower head which was the best I have seen in a hotel (shower wand is also an option too). My wife really liked the scent of the bath products and even took some left over shampoo home! The hotel is as most reviews note in a quiet part of the city and about 10 minute walk from the Ebisu station. The walk was only a little inconvenient as there are escalators and moving walkways almost the entire way and you can stay under cover the entire time (unless it is after 10pm and the Westin lower level entrance is closed which happened one night).Being SPG gold we were entitled to Internet or a free gift, the WiFi at the hotel however was already free (it is fast too) so we just took 250 starpoints as the gift. Our view from the hotel was just ok (on the 8th floor), but we really were not in the room much anyways.In terms of improvements, I did wish the exchange rate was a bit better at the front desk, I understand paying somewhat for convenience but it was about 8 yen different than the official rate which is a big difference in my mind. Other minor items, the shelf in the shower is a bit small for items beyond the provided shampoo and body wash and the towels were on the smaller side (nothing has ever compared to the Conrad Miami towels), but these are very minor items.In summary, we very much enjoyed our stay here, I found the room very elegant in style, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the service top notch.

Upon arrival after a 14-hour flight from NY, we were warmly greeted and check-in was quick and my wife's SPG Gold status was acknowledged. We were upgraded to a corner suite on a high floor with access to the Executive Level Lounge. The lounge was a great venue to start our day off with a plentiful breakfast which included both Japanese and Western fare (including scrambled eggs). We do not drink alcohol, but the Executive Level Lounge also played host to a happy hour in the evenings with some lite bites. We really appreciated the very helpful and accommodating Concierge team, especially Miki, who helped us secure an English speaking private guide within 3 hours of our request! Due to the unfortunate bombings in Bangkok, we made a last-minute change to our Asia vacation itinerary, so we had little time to do our research of what to see and do in the local area. Miki was unfazed by our lack of preparation and was extremely patient in offering us her recommendations. We really appreciated her assistance, and having a private guide to show us around town on our first full-day in Tokyo gave us the confidence to navigate Tokyo's mass transit system on our own throughout our stay. The room was extremely spacious and my wife loved the heated toilet seat and one of the best showers we have ever experienced in a hotel in terms of consistent pressure and temperature. Our only gripe was with the firmness of the Heavenly Bed. Having stayed in numerous Westin Hotels and even own a Heavenly Bed at home - this was clearly either a very old and worn-out mattress or not the usual pillow-top mattress that is part of the standard Heavenly Bed package. Again, this was only a minor inconvenience and did not detract from our experience at all. After flying half-way around the world, we had no issues falling asleep!The area around the hotel is awesome and it's a pleasant 10-12 minute (covered) walk through a nice mall to the Ebisu train station that will allow you to conveniently access other parts of Tokyo.All in all, we had a great stay and will definitely book the Westin Tokyo again for any future travels to that part of the world!",,BSixDriver A,21,5.0

Being a SPG Platinum Member, we were upgraded to one of their suites.

There was also a sort of kitchen table-top with a Nespresso coffee machine, a water boiler, a wash basin and a mini fridge tucked in a cabinet. The Westin signature ""Heavenly bed"" here is slightly less ""fluffy"" then the other Westin properties I have stayed in but it was still very comfortable.

There is a Mitsukoshi department store and some restaurants in the adjacent block plus up in the office tower.

The neighborhood is great and there are a lot of wonderful restaurants around the area.I arrived late in the evening and therefore the check-in process was smooth and swift as there were no crowds.My room was fairly decent sized although it may be rated as small by typical SEA standards. Everything was well maintained and worked perfectly. I had to hunt for the safe deposit box though.The bed was standard King size and very comfortable. There was a work desk facing the window and again it was basic but comfortable. The wifi connection was steady and the speed was adequate for most requirements. There was a standard flat screen TV set at a really odd angle though.The air conditioning worked really well and those who have traveled to Tokyo in summer will know how important this really is.My room faced another building so the view wasn't that great. Having lived in that area before, some of the views are much better.The bathroom was relatively larger than I expected. There was the typical washlet but it did not have instructions in English. Thankfully as I am used to them, no mishaps occurred due to the push of a wrong button. There was a separate shower stall and a bath tub. The water pressure was very good and the water heated up quite well. Toiletries were the standard basic Westin issue.Other than use the concierge desk to book the ticket for the bus to the airport, I did not interact much with the staff on this short trip.I did have breakfast at the restaurant and keep in mind that if you are on a corporate booking, showing the key will get you a fairly substantial discount on the buffet rate.In all, a great option to stay in the Ebisu area.","Singapore, Singapore","Adesitraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",218,4.0

I travel a lot for work, and I have international bank cards that never created any problems so far. On my 2nd day in Tokyo, my Mastercard had an issue and I totally ran out of cash. My AMEX card - the card I used at my hotel check in- was working, but I was planning to spend the weekend in Kyoto where you need cash.Long story short, I begged the hotel concierge and manager literally for 2 days, sent them 6 emails in total. I told them I am ready to pay any commission if they find a way to get me some cash. I could get it wired from my family in the US, they could tell me if there is a Western Union type of company I can use, they could charge my AMEX some amount, and give it to me as cash and I was OK with any commission as I was in a really difficult situation. I had to stop by 3 lunch places one day to find the one that accepts AMEX, I did not have a penny and I don't know anybody in Tokyo.I finally went to Grand Hyatt and told them the situation. They did not believe their ears and were shocked that Westin did not move a finger to help me. They talked to a customer who was having dinner there, he was planning to pay cash. I paid for them with my AMEX and got the cash. Solution was so simple and definitely not worth the stress for 2 days.On top of it, I had a lot of issues with wifi and electricity went off 2 times.I would definitely not recommend Westin Tokyo to anyone.","New York City, New York","mrsdalloway2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",3,1.0

It's about 10 minutes and I found it very convenient.WiFi connection was included and the signal was strong and consistent. I also had breakfast included. The breakfast is nice, with a variety of eastern and western -style food. The only issue is that there could be a wait during busy mornings. I was also there during tourist season, and there's very little a business traveler can do to rush someone on vacation.The room was nice, clean, and comfortable.

The room is, however, a nice sized room with good amenities.

This property does not have the Westin Bed (or so it seemed) and also lacked the pillow variety for comfort, so made good use of the cushions inside the room to fluff up the otherwise thin pillow offering. Connecting to the Wifi in the room was both irritating and hindrance as it seems to stop, start, stick and casually roll through. Seems that the common areas delivers a solid Wifi connectivity, but the rooms lacked the ability to work solidly without interruption.While the Wifi was a let down, don't let that impact the choice of the property. All areas of the hotel, including the oversized room, ambiance, facilities and stylish vibe made it a good hotel within easy reach of the city heartland.Would i stay there again, perhaps not, tokyo is an ever evolving city and hotel offerings are always staying ahead of the curb and so when you consider that Tokyo hotels are often at the +$250 per night, as the Westin is, you would expect more and not to have to pardon let downs.","Paris, France","Wade T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",98,3.0

Yebisu isn't quite as busy as some of the other districts in Tokyo, but there are plenty of restaurants that are open late, some of which are English-friendly. The hotel is distinctly Japanese, but as a Western chain hotel, there are still plenty of amenities that make the transition a little smoother than I've experienced at other hotels in Tokyo. The hotel itself has plenty of restaurants with English menus, which is relieving on that first night after the long trip to Japan. Service here was typically excellent with very good English spoken by every member of staff I spoke with. The hotel is reasonably well located for subway access. It's about a ten-minute walk to Ebisu station, but you can do that entire walk on flat surfaces by going to the B1 (basement) level of the hotel and walking through the Yebisu Garden plaza and following the signs. Much of the walk is on moving walkaways. On the way back from Ebisu station, follow the signs off the platform for the East Exit and you'll see signs for the Westin as you're heading up the first escalator (and on all the subsequent signage as well). The plaza has a small pharmacy that was useful for picking up drinks. While not up to the lofty standards of some of the other hotels in Tokyo, this was a comfortable hotel, and one I'd recommend.","Boston, MA","latrell1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, MA</strong>",137,4.0

The bathroom amenities are plentiful, and include toothbrushes, razor and shaving gel, mouthwash, body wash, lotion, and of course soap, shampoo, and conditioner. Lounge: The lounge itself was pretty disappointing, and not nearly on par with lounges of similar hotels in Asia. There is a ""happy hour"" that only lasts 2 hours and features several types of alcohol. Once the ""happy hour"" is over, the alcohol is removed. Service was also lacking and not on par with other Executive Lounges. The buffet and happy hour features a few items, though probably not enough to sub for dinner. I didn't go to the lounge for breakfast - as an Executive Lounge guest, I opted for the Terrace Restaurant instead, which is included with the Executive package (see separate review: cliff notes - I was quite happy and would recommend)! Area: As others noted, the Ebisu subway station (on the Yamanote line) is an easy 10 minute walk away via the Ebisu Garden sky walk (a series of moving walkways). You are one stop away on the subway from the hip Shibuya area. At the Shibuya station, you can connect to other lines, and namely the Narita Express Train, which takes you to the Tokyo-Narita airport (takes about 75 minutes) for around 3050 yen. There is also a bus that departs to both airports right from the front door of the hotel, though it is quite a bit slower than the Express Trains. Also in the immediate area, one will find numerous restaurants, shops, a large department store (think something like Macy's or Harrods's), a pharmacy, and several fast food restaurants (and of course, the obligatory Starbuck's!). There are Michelin 2 and 3 stared Joel Robuchon restaurants right across the street, too. Overall, my stay here was fine. I found the service to be missing that special ""something"" that other hotels in Asia at the similar price point and star level are able to offer. I would stay here again, though, when the need arises.",Colorado,"Fzedlach</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colorado</strong>",190,4.0

We arrived early so could not check in straight away so we had time to catch a baseball game while our luggage was stored securely with the bellmen.

That evening we had an impeccable dinner at the Yebisu Restaurant located on the 22nd floor, pricy, but then again, if you pay top money for quality service and food, it is to be expected and the team there duly delivered. We liked how after you finish your entrée, you are re seated in another part of the restaurant to enjoy dessert and coffee. The hotel was informed of our honeymoon and while the hotel was running on near full occupancy they gave us a beautiful deluxe room on the 11th floor with a fantastic view of the Tokyo Tower.

I am not your typical fruitcake with a sunny disposition who is easy to please so by taking the time to write this review and it being a glowing one means that this is a fine property. I stayed here for 18 days in January 2015.It is not the rooms that make this a great place to stay. The rooms are actually a bit dated and could use some fresh carpets, curtains and furniture to get with the times. The views from the rooms are okay but not spectacular. The location of the hotel in Ebisu, however, is excellent. You never have to wait for a taxi as they are always lined up and waiting and the subway is a short walk from the hotel. The use of the Garden Place gym is an awesome feature as it is one of the best gyms offered by any hotel anywhere. I highly recommend using the belt massager on your lower back followed by the steam room after a long day of great shopping and chatting up a hundred cute Japanese chicks at Isetan or Ginza.The executive lounge is quite good as well. There is a nice offering of drinks and tasty snacks all day and evening. My colleague practically lived in the lounge he liked it so much. The lobby and common areas while a bit dated still have a grand or somewhat regal feel to them which I appreciated. These areas are more impressive than the rooms.Where this hotel really excels though is its staff. From the bell desk, front desk, concierge, door men to the restaurant staff, they are all first rate, well-trained, impeccably well-mannered and downright helpful. I won't bother with all the silly requests of mine they accommodated to no end but suffice it to say they always obliged with a smile.But I must make special mention and save the best for last. As excellent as all the other staff here are, Chef Danial Jager is the shining star of this hotel. When I told the waiters my first day of my vegan gluten free diet they looked like they were going to pass out at first but it wasn't long before Chef Jager had all kinds of wonderfully special meals prepared each morning which suited my dietary needs and tasted great. Whether it was gluten free and egg free breads to some really exquisite vegan pancakes, Chef Jager's daily creations and hospitality truly helped make the Westin Tokyo a home away from home for me. His warm and light hearted nature was also delightful.You may not have the same diet or whatever but the point is these people will bend over backwards to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable no matter what your requests or eccentricities. To me that it is a true five star level experience. If you want to be catered to, they are willing and able to do it. Kudos to Westin Tokyo from a hard to please guest.","Tokyo, Japan","Bowbowmeow</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",35,5.0

We were pleasantly surprised at the rare greenery as we approached the hotel, which also had a very attractive garden area. This was a quiet property for Tokyo, unlike some of the busier more crowded and hectic areas around town, so was a very nice experienceI was initially a bit turned off when entering the lobby as it seemed rather ornate and a bit gaudy, but that was the extent of what I did not like about the hotel. Everything else here was first rate. Check in went smoothly and we were given a large, comfortable double bed room, with a roll away for our son and a great view of Tokyo with Mt. Fuji in the distance. There was plenty of space for all of us. The room was clean, well appointed, with every amenity we required, lots of towels, glasses, yukatas and toiletries.Service here is wonderful, every employee we dealt with was polite, courteous and extremely helpful in making our stay memorable. We had sent our luggage by takkyubin from Kyoto and our bags were waiting for us in our room when we checked in. The airport limousine to Narita which picks up at the lobby entrance is also a great convenience. The Compass Rose Lounge on the 22nd floor is a nice place to enjoy a cocktail in the evening overlooking the Tokyo skyline and city lights.The hotel is well situated for city transportation, the Hibiya subway line and Yamanote JR line at Ebisu station are a short walk from the hotel and we easily navigated Tokyo from here. In inclement weather you can walk the entire distance between the hotel and station via covered walkways and moving sidewalk. There are numerous shops in the station itself including an Atre department store. There is also a nearby Mitsukoshi department store branch which is very convenient. Although we loved stopping at Japanese coffee houses on our trip, we made good use of the nearby Starbucks in the morning where they have the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had at any Starbucks previously.We loved our 5 night stay at the Westin Tokyo and would not hesitate to stay here again on future visits.","Honolulu, Hawaii","VacationPlanner</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",63,5.0

Location- It’s nice being out of the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. The Ebisu location is much more tranquil than walking out the door and having throngs of people everywhere (think NYC Times Square). The Ebisu train station is about a 1o to 15 minute walk. The only downside if you want to go where the action is, it’s about a 10 to 15 minute walk. BTW, there are many very interesting restaurants near the Ebisu train station.2. Rooms- The size of the rooms are very large compared to most Tokyo hotel rooms and even bigger than the average USA hotel room. The rooms have a European feel with lots of granite and woods. I had a city view on the 19th Executive Club floor and had a beautiful view of the Tokyo Tower. 3. Service- Tokyo is known for the service and the Westin Tokyo is over-the- top. In the morning you will always hear a chorus of “Ohayou gozaimas,” meaning “Good Morning.” The concierge, especially Benika was outstanding. She spent a lot of time writing down detailed instructions for anything I wanted to do. I think she would have gone with me to make sure I was ok but she did have to work. One of the hostesses in the Club Lounge stood out was Wakaba. She always had a big smile and was very attentive. 4. Price- The price for the location, rooms, and service is very reasonable. At this time, the dollar is strong to the Japanese yen (close to 120). The rate was around $200/ night. For a Five- Star hotel you can’t go wrong","Los Angeles, California","Mike D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",63,5.0

The room is very spacious with a large king bed, and a sitting area with sofa and arm chair and a large executive desk. The bathroom is very dated (think salmon pink 80s classic) but it's very spacious and has good amenities. The shower also has very good pressure. The whole room and bathroom is very clean and well presented. The room has a tea maker, a coffee maker and a well stocked minibar which makes it that much more comfortable.The executive lounge was well presented with ample food and beverage options. The service was OK. To be honest I expected something a little more personal, despite the size of the hotel. The views are enjoyable from the lounge and all the tables are fitted with tub chairs so you can make yourself comfortable and take in the view of downtown whilst enjoying a drink.The lobby is very impressive, and the commissionaires and concierge are very helpful and cheerful.The hotel is opposite a medium sized mitsukoshi department store, and the Ebisu beer garden which has nice summer-time outdoor seating. Keep walking (through an air-conditioned skyway) and you'll reach Ebisu station which is on the Yamanote JR loop line - one stop to Shibuya, and a few more to Harajuku and also the grey metro line, only a few stops to Ginza.The area is quite out of 'down town', or what foreigners perceive as down town Tokyo, however with the trains and subway is well connected. It's located on a very quite street so you feel you're returning home as opposed to just going upstairs after a long day.One tip; if you're arriving from Osaka on Shinkansen, alight at Shinjuku station, not Tokyo Station.

A cold, impersonal check-in set the tone, but it continued right through the stay as we kept running into staff with attitude all around the hotel (front desk, concierge, restaurant). The only hint of warmth I saw was from one person in the executive lounge. I really wonder how this can be a hotel in this service/price category in such a service-oriented country.

When we first arrived, I found that the staff were not helpful at all. They provided the cold service and I had a hard time communicate with them in English. We had to take care of our luggages ourselves after long hectic flight. I expected better from the so-called 5 stars hotel. Free wifi available in the lobby. We stayed in early Dec so they had the big Christmas tree up with magnificent decorations. The overall atmosphere was festive and grand. The most impressive thing from the stay was its location that right across the street from the Yebisu Garden Place where they had the Baccarat Eternal Lights (one of the world's largest chandeliers) on display. It was a great joy to walk pass it everyday during our stay.The room was large, we got one overlooking the Yebisu Garden Place and the Michelin stars Joel Robuchon restaurant. The room was dated but comfy and clean.The nearest JR station is Ebisu, Yamanote Line (light green) which runs in a circle to most of the tourist attraction spots. It was quite a walk from the hotel (maybe 8 to 10 mins, I was always distracted by the grand chandelier so was unable to time my walk), we had to walk through the Yebisu Garden Place everyday in order to get to either JR or subway station. Walking further from JR station for another 5 mins, there was a subway station, Hibiya Line (gray). I found it was easier to travel through JR trains. There were many restaurants and shopping malls near by. However, the restaurants around the neighborhood were mostly Western cuisine. We bought a round-trip Airport Limousine Bus from the Narita airport (bus stop no. 13) for ¥6000 per person. It came with 3-day unlimited subway pass. For ¥5700, you would get the round-trip tkts for airport bus and 2-day unlimited subway pass. The bus dropped us off at the hotel. There were a few tickets kiosks at the airport. To stay connect, I rented a SIM card with local number from Softbank. They also provided an option of renting the handset. For Japan, you don't have to pay for incoming calls (which is different from the states). The other option was getting a pocket wifi, so you can stay connect all the times. Before you leave, you must return the SIM card at the airport drop box. For pocket wifi, you can either return it at the airport or return by post before you leave the country.I found the location was inconvenient, I would stay elsewhere next time e.g. Shinjuku or Ginza. Overall the level of service was below my expectation and took forever to walk from the hotel to train station both JR and subway.

Each time I had wonderful stay experiences.Westin Tokyo, which is opened in 1995, has a glorious history. It was ever one of the ""New Gosanke (The New Best Three)"" hotels in Tokyo. Although the crown isn't on it anymore due to the aging of the hotel, the service and the hardware maintenance are still outstanding.The corner room is slightly larger than regular room and the layout is just excellent. The king size comfy bed is in the opposite of the sofa, where the flat-screen TV and the reading desk is in the middle beside the window area, makes it very convenient to do anything just like your own room. The room is one of the most comfortable that I've experienced in Tokyo in terms of the comfortableness of the bed, the air condition and the quietness. The hotel is located in Ebisu Garden Place Complex, where is a twenty-year-old multi-functional area includes a department store, a hotel and several nice restaurants, stores and office buildings. Although it takes around 10-15 mins from Ebisu Station through Yebisu Skywalk by walk, you won't feel it far away because the elegant atmosphere around the whole Ebisu/Daikanyama area and the convenient shopping surround the hotel.Regarding the airport transfer, although it has limousine bus directly from the hotel lobby to Narita or Hakone Airport in every 20 mins, I still recommend to take the railway to save either time and money. The Limousine is almost two times expensive but takes almost the same time to the airport as the railway.In general, Westin Tokyo impressed me a lot and I would recommend to all tourists to give it a try, especially if you are a fan of Daikankama.","Taipei, Taiwan","JulianLin921</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Taipei, Taiwan</strong>",45,5.0

The Westin Tokyo was our favorite for location and amenities. It could be different from the other floors, but we were fortunate to stay on an executive club floor. Service at the hotel was also amazing. But everywhere we went, most people were polite, friendly and hospitable locals - despite the fact that we didn't speak the language. We felt so pampered in this country!The dining area served up a light buffet-style breakfast (mostly American with a few asian options). There is also a restaurant in the lobby which executive floor guests can opt to dine at. If you're craving desserts, there is an amazing dessert restaurant. You can also get desserts to go. The staff will package these securely if you're traveling by train to your destination. There is also a fitness facility adjacent to the hotel (from the lower floor), that guests can use, but we got our workouts from hopping trains and seeing so many sights in Tokyo and nearby cities. The hotel is situated across from the Yebisu Garden (former beer brewery) and about .4 miles from the train/subway station - so you can catch JR trains (Yamanote line) to the major JR stations (to catch the Shinkansen/bullet trains), or local train lines. Allow time to walk. There are 'moving walkways' to assist in your journey which is also good if you're in a hurry (stand to the left/pass to the right). The station is accessible from a protected walkway (lower hotel floor), so you don't need to worry about rainy days (which are quite common). Also, there are many restaurants in this area, so you don't need to worry about where you'll get your next meal. The Mitsukoshi Department store is also here, so if you're looking for a snack and an amazing grocery/food fair experience, head to the basement of this big department store.

The Westin Tokyo was a great 5-star hotel is Ebisu, close to the subway and near some very good restaurants. The lobby and general hotel is very nice, but the rooms could use an improvement. We stayed here twice, once on the front end of our trip and once on the back end. While the rooms we had were both on the 18th floor and were similar, there were some minor differences that we definitely noticed, after our first stay. The rooms in general were a bit outdated, but still had that Japanese ""high-tech"" feel, with automated blinds, lights, bathrooms, etc. The second room didn't have some of the same conveniences as the automated blinds and lights, which was a little annoying. The staff, while hospitable, was a bit scattered. The concierge and front desk were a bit slow and speaking English in Japan can always be cumbersome (and rightfully so, as English is not Japan's official language). Overall, the restaurants, bars, and hotel in general was as expected for a Westin and I would definitely stay there again (after all, we returned at the end of our trip and despite the minor downgrade in room, were still satisfied). Understandably, it was a work week and we were not upgraded, which was disappointing. But being a Platinum member with an ambassador (i.e., I've stayed in SPG hotels for over 100 nights this year alone), I didn't feel completely ""pampered"" as I've come to expect at SPG hotels.

So many good things to say about this place. Lobby: Upon entry, you feel like you're in a very refined, dignified establishment. It feels very mature, which was different from our experience at the Westin in Beijing and Shanghai. Both were nice hotels, but they seemed to be going more for a hip vibe. Check-in was smooth and quick and the concierge was very helpful in terms of planning our stay in Tokyo. We went to a lounge in the lobby, which enforces a dress code (no shorts, etc.). Great service and drinks.Rooms: Our room was quite large and our friend's room was also a nice size. Everything was tidy and clean. Our room had a large desk with a fax machine, which I found hilarious. I had been told that it's still very common to use a fax machine in Japan, and sure enough we had one in our room. Our bathroom was also very large and the standing shower was terrific. Wifi: You have to pay for wifi, which again is very annoying. I hate paying to stay in a premier hotel and then have to be nickel and dimed for something as necessary as wifi. Location: The hotel is in Ebisu in Meguro. You have to walk a bit to get to the subway, but it's a pleasant walk and we always felt safe regardless of the time. I was surprised I wasn't bothered more by the walk to the subway since that's usually something I find annoying. We didn't do any touristy things in our area, but getting around Tokyo by subway is so easy. You can go everywhere on the subway. Service: Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. The staff is clearly well-trained. I had no issues at all. The concierge team is knowledgeable and was ready and able to answer our questions and the front desk attendants were incredibly helpful and efficient. I had some laundry done, which wasn't cheap, but they were quick.

If you are arriving from Narita, plan on 1.5 hours to get to the hotel using the Airport Buses. They drop you off right in front of the hotel, which is nice. I didn't do my research when I booked this hotel as I booked it only because it was an SPG property - I used a Suite Night to be upgraded to a suite and was not that impressed. IT was two rooms put together. The decor might suit some but the marble pillars was a bit over the top for me. The room was huge but the furniture could be updated. The hallway carpet could be updated. The entire hotel could be updated. I can vaguely recall the movie Lost in Translation but I felt like I was in the sequel. I felt slightly off in this hotel. For starters, no channel was in English. There was CNN and BBC but it was voiced over in Japanese. There were appliances in the room's wet bar that were completely in Japanese. One of them had hot water and one of them was a expresso type machine but again, it was all in Japanese. I felt disconnected and like I should speak Japanese. The breakfast was very nice and varied. I did not like how the young lady at the front told me that the restaurant was closing in 25 minutes. I came at 10:05 and it closed at 10:30. I do not need to be told when breakfast was closing and 25 minutes was more than enough time for me to eat. The Club Lounge was nice with great views - varied food and alcohol. It seemed like guests made this a great meeting spot. The location is great - I would recommend staying here as a great base. Even though I felt greatly the language barrier, I followed the concierge's directions easily to the Ebisu station and from there, went all over. IT is not a far walk to Ebisu as you walk perhaps 5 minutes through this park and admire the trees and lights and then the moving floor can walk for you the rest of the way! Perhaps if I had spent more time there, it would have grown on me but I couldn't help but feel disconnected during my time there.

A drawback already mentioned is location but an easy walk with moving sidewalks for a portion of the distance to Ebisu station puts you either on the core Hibiya Line to Roppongi or the Ginza or JR rail to all destinations.

Overall the experiences were excellent. If you had stayed in any other Starwood hotels in the past, this hotel was pretty much the same as any other in the US or in Europe. The room was rather spacious by Japanese standards as I have had stayed in other hotels in Japan many times before. This room was a palace compare to the others. I never had to play “zones” when there was more than one person in the room. The view was to die for as it was facing dead center to the Tokyo Tower. Like any other Starwood hotels that I have stayed before, the room was clean, the maid services were excellent and checking in was a breeze. There’s nothing I can complain about with this hotel.However, with regard to the location of the hotel, it’s not an ideal location for people that like to explore Tokyo by walking. While this hotel is located near the Ebisu station on the JR line, it’s not close to anything in my opinion. You have to take the metro every time to grab something to eat or have a drink. It’s true there were a few restaurants around the hotels but choices were very limited. Perhaps I am little biased because I have stayed in many different hotels in Tokyo and I’ve got the opportunities to compare. I prefer a hotel where I can walk to a supermarket, restaurants or a bar whenever I want to even late in the evening.

Stayed for 3 days, as a SPG plat member, I was upgraded to a club room. I think room size are about the same as the normal ones but the lounge access is included. Nothing fantastic about the decor of the room and lounge seems to be just normal. In fact the lounge is below my expectation as compared with other Westins.I tried the buffet breakfast it was great, a very good spread but a long queue if you are there during morning peak hours and waiting for the omelet. Location is fantastic if you are looking for somewhere pretty quiet at night but still only 1 station away from the action. Westin is basically just 1 station away from Shibuya and even a taxi ride is not that expensive. Opposite the hotel you can find the Yebisu Garden Place which is convenient for a supermarket, some restaurants, pharmacy and a Family Mart. There's even a DVD/CD rental store right next to the Westin. Yebisu used to be a brewery, hence you can find an assortment of beer served in the premise. Including a museum which is pretty interesting.Only complaint I have for my stay is that if you are going to the airport at 6:30am (only the 2nd morning pickup), there's nothing the hotel can provide for breakfast.

Only a ten minute walk (with over half a dozen moving walkways) to Ebisu Station that is on the key JR Yamanote train line that circles tokyo. The area around the station is fabulous, as is the neighbourhood around the hotel. Worth a walk outside (not in the fancy walkway tunnel) to get your bearings, discover some great dinner options, shopping and find the local convenience stores. Specifically, we did a two-person karaoke by the station at Big Echo, a must date in Japan! We discovered Mos Burger (north end of station near overpass, chilli burger amazeballs), a local pub restaurant, three min from hotel, a ramen chain, amazing Soba: all pictured menus so super easy to order. I did a tonne of shopping in the mitsukoshi department store across from the hotel on my last day. Wish I had discovered it earlier. The room was super clean. We were on the 19th floor and had a superb view of the city. The Tokyo tour side is probably in demand unless it is winter because on the other side you can sometimes see Mt Fugi: both very cool! We ate at the Chinese Restaurant in house. The service was insanely attentive and the food good. A little expensive but we needed a night in. Also, we stayed here on our first night then left our luggage at the front desk for a two day back-pack train trip to nagano.

This hotel is absolutely beautiful. There is marble everywhere. Very, very, very nicely decorated and extremely upscale feeling, but not pretentious at all. We are plat SPG and were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. We received a nice suite upgrade and also had access to their club lounge. I found that ALL hotel staff members were very accommodating and very helpful. I was surprised at how quiet this hotel was. I had never been to Tokyo before and granted other parts of the city are quite noisy (like Time Square on steroids), this part of Tokyo (near Ebisu JR train line) was extremely quiet. I would definitely stay there again. I really liked the fact that they offer guests a ""going green option"". We don't need our sheets nor towels changed daily so for each day that we opted out of a linen change we received a 500 spg point credit. This was a nice perk, but we would have opted out most days either way. Additionally, Ebisu train station is relatively close by and you can access most main sites in Tokyo from this line without having to access the subway at all. Lastly, there are some really great local restaurants just outside of the Ebisu train station…don't exit the Garden Palace exit (where the hotel is)…take the other exit from the train station. You will see a bank there then immediately across the street you will see a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant and a life size statue of Colonel Sanders. Go down the street right by the KFC. You will see some small restaurants that seat only 5-10 people, but the food is cheap and very good. If you go about halfway down that street on the left side you will find a nice local stand up bar also. Overall the entire area feels very safe and is lovely to walk around at night time. You will be very happy at the Westin. We did go to the Park Hyatt to have a drink and check out the view and the staff was super stuffy and the glasses of wine and champagne were half / 3/4 pours. My husband (a sommelier) and I thought they were joking or they were going to come back for a refill etc.. but they didn't. You won't find that sort of attitude at the Westin. They will roll out the red carpet for you but make you feel super comfortable and welcome even if you are wearing blue jeans. The bar is nice and the food is great too. Well worth a visit. One of the nicest Westin hotels that I've stayed in. Well above par compared to US Westin's. Enjoy….Wish I was there now :) … P.S. quick testament to classiness of hotel….we were only going to stay for 6 nights, but added on a 7th. We had the suite upgrade and then added points for regular room for the 7th night. We offered to move to a standard room for our last night (understanding that they probably needed the suite for another customer)..and we were ok with moving. The next am they called us and invited us to stay that last night in our current suite and that we didn't have to move etc. I thought this was a really classy gesture. We are very grateful for how much the staff there went out of their way to make our stay even more pleasurable. You will enjoy your stay too. Nice and quiet…beautiful…Also there is a Joel Rubicon restaurant right across the street too. We visit Atelier in Las Vegas so we didn't go the his restaurant whilst in Tokyo, but the location can't be beat if you like his food then that would be a great choice. We opted for more affordable, traditional Japanese food in the area that I mentioned earlier in this post or at other parts of Tokyo.",San Diego,"Nancy M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",110,5.0

Having previously stayed in Westin Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Venice, Singapore, Osaka -- our recent stay at Westin Tokyo indeed sealed my utmost fascination to this SPG Hotel.Sheer opulence -- that is the best description that I can say about this hotel. The hotel I believe is one of the oldest hotel in Tokyo, but I can claim that it’s being “vintage” further enhanced the hotel’s lavishness.The room that we occupied was quite spacious, me and my husband plus our teenager (son) fitted in comfortably in their double room. The room was super clean and was generously provided of in-room amenities. I can never complain, specially that the room that was allocated for us had the view of Tokyo’s skyline and the famous Tokyo Tower!Service and hospitality at this hotel was commendable. I communicated a number of times to the hotel prior to our arrival and my emails were answered promptly and all of our requests were graciously accommodated.The location of the hotel was also an advantage, it is a few minutes’ walk to the train and subway stations. The covered walkway to the Ebisu Station is accessible from the hotel’s basement. Ebisu is on the main train line (Yamanote) and this provides accessibility to most of the tourist attractions in Tokyo.There is a convenience store (7/11) nearby and a number of restaurants and cafes are also available within walking distance.I love Tokyo, I love Westin and I wish to go back!","Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","DianeA915</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates</strong>",29,5.0

The location was perfect, right in the middle of the Higashiyama district, a short bike ride to the temples in either the northern part of the district or the south. A shuttle ran every 30 minutes to Gion, a 15-minute ride away. The view of the city from the rooftop was stunning. But best of all was the service, by far the best I've experienced anywhere. The concierge went out of her way to sort out a problem with one of the bikes we rented from an outside vendor, even going so far as to pay us back for the faulty bike before the vendor came to pick it up. We must have asked them to reserve a half dozen restaurants for us and they kept trying until we finally found a place that was open/not booked.The rooms, though a little dated, were very spacious and clean, with a nice view of the gardens.

I've had the opportunity to stay at many of the Westin properties across Europe and would say that it is the equal of the top units there. It may not have the grandeur of some of the older and more historical properties there but when evaluating all areas to be reviewed, it really can be included among the best.What really stood out was the effort among almost all the staff that I encountered throughout my stay. Efficient, helpful, friendly and concerned are words that come to mind when describing the service. I've been in the hospitality business for over 30 years as an owner of restaurants and a consultant, I can state that the level of service received as exemplary. Only in one instance would I state that the service was not up to the level of the others and that was at the formal bar. The bartender was extremely efficient but a bit too a aloof for my liking. However, that may be the approach the management wants at that venue so I can't really fault the ""style"" there.The corner room was an upgrade on the higher executive floor with a great view of the city. I had booked another room for my business associate and although he is not a Platinum member they still upgraded him to a similar room and accorded him all the same benefits. Quite a magnanimous gesture especially considering the benefits one receives as a Platinum member especially in properties outside the States. Clean, tidy and many creature comforts such as a casual kimono to wear made it a place to relax after a long day. A small issue to mention was the very faint smell of cigarette smoke. Although the room was non smoking, I think that the ventilation system may have been the culprit as my associate who was on the same floor noticed the same slight odor. Again a minor issue that didn't detract from my opinion of my stay.Food and beverage quality was of high quality and choice at the breakfast buffet. The food in the Executive lounge wasn't up to the same quality of the main restaurant but more than acceptable. Great choices of spirits at the formal bar was much appreciated especially among the single malt Scotches. Although many of previous reviews mention the high prices for food and beverages here, I really didn't find them to be that overly priced and remember as a reference again, I'm in the business.Location is superb as Ebisu is a good location for many reasons. Yebisu Gardens and the surrounding facility is quite nice and spacious in a modern setting. The Ebisu train station is about a 10 minute walk but is an easy stroll through the Ebisu Garden facility and made easy by a motorized skywalk if you're a bit tired. Taxi rides to the major areas are not overly long. The longest one was to the Tsukiji fish market which was about 25 minutes.All in all a very satisfying stay and when I return to Tokyo again, I won't see a need to look anywhere else to reside. The Westin Tokyo had made that a very easy decision.","Granite Bay, California","KamikawaSan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Granite Bay, California</strong>",112,5.0

I liked the location because it was away from the busy areas, but still a lot of good shoppings and restaurants nearby. A lovely sunday market was just across the street from the front door.

Almost everyone in the hotel could speak good english, all of them were helpful. It might be the Japanese culture that they didn't really have big smiles on their faces but I could feel they were keen to meet our requests. There was a mistake made by one of the concierge staff which caused us quite a bit of trouble, but they tried hard enough to solve it. A sincere apology from the staff and the guest relationship manager were good enough and they did all their best to help me out throught out the rest of the stay. I would like to send a big thank you to the ladies at the concierge and the guest relationship manager who was kind enough to listen to my complaint. A bottle of sparkling wine was sent to us for our anniversary, it was a nice touch. Room was a bit in the 90s style but nice and clean with all the things we needed. I traveled with my two daughters and those kids pajamas were cute and comfy. Breakfasts were excellent, and on Sunday we had the japanese style breakfast in the Japanese restaurant and it was really good.

The club room is good/average. Breakfast is also good/average. The service at the hotel is phenomenal. The hotel was sold out for one of the nights in the middle of our trip to Japan. We decided we wanted to stay in Tokyo at the hotel, and the desk attendant in the club lounge not only was able to get us our room, but also allowed us to use points for the night. The concierge was able to help us get tickets to a baseball game, gave us maps to get to the best stops in the fish market, and recommended several stationery stores to me and marked them on a few maps. My only complaint was the bed. The mattress was very firm, and the pillows were very thin and soft.

I did notice there weren’t as many bathroom amenities in this room though and thought that cotton swabs would be standard fare?There are many conference rooms on the lower floors and it seems to me that there’s always a wedding in this hotel? Perhaps the Westin Tokyo specialises in this? The JR Yamanote line is very convenient for getting around Tokyo and it’s about a 10-15 minute meander to the Ebisu station with the Hibiya subway station only a few minutes further.The sound of the trains passing is noticeable from the room but not loud enough to be annoying.Again, a great stay and recommended to all!","Wellington, New Zealand","RayC888</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",151,4.0

However, I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room. Our room was on the SPG floor, 14th, so we had a nice view. The bathroom was huge with a generous soaking tub and a separate shower. It also has a large counter space and a well-stocked toiletries chest with q-tips, cotton balls, comb, shower cap, etc., it has a gym but I was too tired to use it and reserving my energy for the extensive walking throughout the day. Right across the street is a shopping area with Mitsukoshi department store, Starbucks, Baskin Robbin, Burger King, etc. The JR train station is indeed a 7-minute (brisk) walk from the hotel through the mall and a covered walkway with a series of travellators. The subway station is a few minutes walk from the JR station though another mall connected to the station. We ate twice at a Hokkaido restaurant across the street from the hotel, on the 39th floor of Ebisu Garden Place.

We no longer had Starwood Preferred Gold status (didn't make status for this year), but the hotel still treated us very well. We used points + cash for the stay, which is a great deal because you get a big room with all the amenities -- it has to be one of the larger rooms in Tokyo.It was raining. We arrived at Ebisu Station on the convenient Hamone-Yamoto line and walked all the way underground to the hotel so that rain never hit us. Walk to Ebisu Garden Place using the moving walkways, stay to the right and go down an escalator towards ""Glass Palace"". Go past Baskin Robbins ice cream and Burger King, and enter on the basement floor of Westin (door on your left). Your head should always be covered, although at one point you're exposed to the wind.Because the weather remained rainy on our visit, Westin was a perfect visit as we used this underground passage to get food (Robuchon, Lawry's, Dean & Deluca are some high-end options, but they've got a ton of Japanese ministalls and bakeries on basement 2nd level and local Japanese restaurants.) We also used the gym a lot -- again very much appreciated on a rainy day. It was also enjoyable to soak in the large bathtub.I had originally booked a small budget room in Tokyo but am so glad we splurged on the Westin. It's nice to be able to stay in and enjoy some English-speaking TV channels, a gym, etc and not be forced to go out. It turned our vacation into a relaxing staycation.

Also from Haneda airport access is not as straightforward as only 2 airport buses a day goes to Westin and vice versa.

Some of the nice touches include fresh sqeezed orange juice, and fresh berry juice and omelettes and eggs made to order while you wait.Other than the buffet, prices for food are typical for Tokyo, which is to say they can be a bit pricey, and the serving sizes are much smaller than most westerners will be used to. This is a quibble, especially as I do not think we have every had anything to eat at the Westin that was not outstanding.Staff are polite, efficient and helpful.

We also stayed at the Westin Osaka, which was also very nice with one big difference. It seems that the Westin Osaka's management did not prefer that the employees accept tips. Understandably in Japan where excellent service is expected. However, I feel that the Westin Tokyo employees were more encouraged to accept tips if offered. Although they all refused, they did accept less reluctantly than the employees at the Westin Osaka. I believe this may be due to the General Manager of the Westin Tokyo being far more employee centric than cultural centric. I'm sure most of us writing or reading reviews have had service jobs at one point in their lives. When did any of us ever completely refuse a tip that a customer insisted we accept based upon our knowing we provided good service. I believe that the Westin Tokyo's management feels this way too. Therefore, even though it is not expected that one tips in Japan, my feeling is TIP! You won't get any less service either way, but you'll see a lot of gratitude from employees wherever you go. We're all human.","Honolulu, Hawaii","HolualoaHI</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",15,5.0

Even with non-smoking floors, the air quality is still awful around the public areas.Just realized after this stay that the Westin heavenly bed here is not as comfortable. The bed is too firm. Also just realized that the hotel did not have a pool for recreational purposes; it is contracted with a health club next door.Booked two nights on C&P and the other two on prepaid rate. Applied SNA and both SNA requests were not confirmed and SNA returned; bummed. Was upgraded to a corner suite on the 21st floor (top floor just below the 22nd restaurants). Breakfast is still available on the first floor in the terrace restaurant and child 3 and under is still free (child 4 to 12 have to pay 2,200 yen; compared to 3,600 yen for 13 and older).

Doorways and halls were all large enough to accommodate, and elevators (6, I believe) were quick to arrive regardless of the hour. Our room had a large bathroom with a deep bathtub, as well as a glass walled, walk in shower with lots of room (accessible showers were hit and miss during the rest of our trip, learned to use the term ""universal"" in the last hotel we stayed at for a wheelchair accessible room). The room itself was spacious, well lit, clean, and quiet. They gave us a 3rd bed before we even arrived - with a real mattress - but once we determined that the 3rd wasn't necessary the man who escorted us to our room immediately secured and removed it from our room. There was no wait for our luggage to arrive.The exercise room is nice, but clearly not a high traffic area. There are perhaps 2 of each machine, but the area didn’t feel confined.Staff was very helpful and friendly, and very quick. The continental/buffet breakfast was fantastic, with a huge variety of food (more Western than Eastern, but both included), everything kept well stocked and fresh during my visit. The cleaning service left a bottle of water for each occupant every day, which was a huge help for me, personally, as water isn't an automatic service when dining out the way it is where I live and I often forgot to purchase water while we were out and about.I very much appreciated the location; we were off of any main roads so it was quiet. It's right across the street from a department store and large public area, so we had access to a grocery, restaurants, cafes as well as some fast food and a convenience store (this one is in the taller building, behind the elevators). There isn't a lot of signage, so we kept discovering new places every day - down stairs, around corners, inside one of the larger buildings, or at the back of one.The walk to the sky way that led to Ebisu station was very nice, and the sky way itself has conveyor walkways. If you're bringing a wheelchair, though, I recommend NOT using the walkways unless you'll be walking on them, they're not wide enough to allow pedestrians to squeeze past a stationary chair very easily. There's more than enough room on the path between conveyor walks. One thing to keep in mind with a wheelchair – at Ebisu station there is no elevator between the train platforms and the ticketing level; **ask for help if you cannot use an escalator or stairs without assistance.** This was the only station we encountered this issue with during the entire trip.Between the quality of the rooms, the breakfast, the location, and the service, I'd very much recommend the Westin Tokyo to anyone considering using it for a quiet, comfortable trip. My companion responsible for booking our trip mentioned that this location was even nicer than she'd anticipated, after staying in other Westin locations. If you want to be closer to the energy and hustle more typical of touristy areas, with less of a walk to the train, consider another location.My *only* complaint is that wi-fi was not free throughout the hotel - only in the lobby area. Other wise, 1500 Y per day for access from your room. This was the only location that charged an additional fee for wireless access during our trip, and the speed wasn't very good during the one day we elected to try it out.","Peoria, Arizona","AmeWil</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Peoria, Arizona</strong>",19,5.0

We picked this hotel primarily due to it offering an executive floor and a lounge, so indeed we picked what the hotel calls an “Executive Club Room”. Coming from Nartia; the hotel is easy to reach and fairly well connected to public transport. It is set in a fairly peaceful part of Tokyo and overall location was a nice mix of practical (good connections) and quiet. As with all around Tokyo: surroundings are safe and clean. Check-in in was quick, efficient and polite; as with everything in Japan.The hotel lobby is fairly big and seems always busy. While the hotel describes itself featuring a “classical European” décor; I would rather call it American. A mixture of dark woods, black marble and gold dominate the appeal and it does have some charm of the 90ties. Yet that’s what you would expect form the Westin brand anyway and everything was well maintained. So no critique here; just know what you are up to.Our room was fairly big and arranged on the corner of the hotel tower. The cheesy decoration went on in the room and there was nothing in the room that would tell you that you are in Japan, it’s all western. Yet again we expected that and as a western tourist; it can be relaxing after a day in the city. Biggest asset about the room were the beds: wonderfully comfortable! It did feature a little lounge area, desk, huge TV and a nicely appointed bathroom: everything you would expect form a 5* chain hotel. Since we had a room on the Executive floor, we had access to the club lounge. The lounge itself is standard (and again: exactly what you would expect from an American hotel chain). Breakfast was a mixture of Japanese and western continental, starting your day with a view over Tokyo is however rather pleasant!Drinks are being served in the afternoon in the lounge; and supposing also snacks, although that was nothing more than a few crisps. Overall selection of refreshments, drinks and snacks was disappointing.Biggest problem however was the continuous overcrowding. Indeed; 4 out of 5 days we were refused access to the lounge in the afternoon. Considering it is a service I am paying for; unacceptable to me. On the 3rd day I complained at the reception and asked to be presented with an alternative for a service I have obviously paid for and within 3 minutes I suddenly was granted access to the lounge.Overall this hotel does what you expect it do to: provides a good night sleep in a clean and comfortable environment with friendly and efficient personnel. They however certainly don’t go the extra mile and I felt being presented with exactly what I had paid for. The issues with not being able to get into the lounge is however too much for me.

It's a roughly 4 km walk to Tokyo tower, which is pleasant enough to do. The hotel has a large garden at the back, with a traditional wooden building in it, and water features, which might well be nice for a walk. Unfortunately it only opens to guests at 11:00, which meant I couldn't visit it, as I needed to leave earlier than that each day.Buffet breakfast was excellent: good variety, and (a really positive point) the selection varies slightly each day (e.g. the flavours of the smoothies that they offer), which made it great when staying for several days.Room was fine, and the shower in particular was very good: a rain shower with a decent pressure behind it.Staff were generally helpful, including being very happy to change which newspaper was hung on my door in the mornings. I did try to negotiate for late check-out, but only managed to obtain 1.5 hours extra.

This is a fantastic full service gym with all the facilities you can imagine (swimming pool, racquetball courts, yoga classes, hot pools, all the resistance machines and cardio equipment you could want, plus some free weights). It has limited hours on the weekend (does not open until 8 am, for example). The Westin Workout on the 4th floor, however, is open 24/7 and is actually decently equipped for a small hotel gym. They have 4 treadmills, 2 cross-trainers, 1 step machine, 2 recumbent bikes. They have a small collection of Lifefitness resistance machines including chest press, shoulder press, pull down, leg curl, and leg extension. There are also two benches and dumbbells to 20 kg. There are two Swiss balls and a small area for stretching. There are towels, earphones and water but no changing facilities. <Executive Lounge>: when I was there it was never over-crowded, the staff is friendly and most speak very good English (in contrast to the main reception, in my experience) but they need to raise their game in terms of happy hour snacks! It was the least enticing spread I have ever seen in any executive lounge anywhere in the world (and I am very experienced in executive lounges!). There was a pitiful selection of potato chips, nuts, some cheeses, mysterious cold cuts and bread and then some unappetizing warm snacks like corn soup, little ramekins of roasted sweet potato, etc. Really more like rations in a Soviet era canteen. But there is a decent selection of wines and spirits in free pour. Lastly, and a major reason for my “average” review is that the hotel seems to have some service issues throughout, exemplified by the restaurant where breakfast is served. They had hotel guests waiting on a recent Saturday morning for 30-45 minutes to get a table for breakfast. By the time we were seated, they were closing down the restaurant. One would think that keeping the buffet open in an overcrowded hotel restaurant is the least they could do. Serving breakfast to guests is one thing a hotel must get right, as we have nowhere else to go, certainly not in this quiet and removed area of Tokyo.","Paris, France","Superdeluxe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",209,3.0

Upon arrival we were impressed with the outside and the interior - it was old fashioned, but comfortable and as it was December there were some lovely christmas decorations on show. The hotel were quick to check us in, reminded us that we had arrived early, but luckily our room was ready. A delightful Japanese lady escorted us to our room, struggling with our bags. Our room was on the 10th floor - it was spacious with more than adequate extras and an almost ridiculously big bathroom! The toilet wasn't as space age as I was expecting (which I was really rather glad about!).So the hotel interior and room were great, really pleased with those.Just a short walk from the hotel is Yebisu Garden Place, which was lovely - a really clean and tidy creation full of coffee shops, food and restaurants. There is a shopping mall there, with a delightful food hall in the basement. Having discovered that Excelsior offer the nearest to a decent british tea I was thrilled that there was a chain in there!A short walk to the nearest station - easily accessible for most things. It was one stop on the JR Yamanote Line to Shibuya, which we went to most nights. (You can get day passes on the JR Line quite reasonably, we did this and paid extra for any useage of the Metro that we needed - not sure if it would have been better to get the pass that included both).The biggest perk of the room was the view of Mount Fuji on a clear day! Really humbling.The worst thing about the hotel was the overpriced food - we ordered a few things from room service and were genuinely shocked about the price. Choosing afterwards to get food out and about.

Room was your standard size, but amenities and toiletries were very sufficient. If you forgot your razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, etc. you won't have to worry as everything is provided for you here. Cleaning staff did a great job of getting everything cleaned right away. Concierge, front desk, and bellhops were all very polite, efficient, and helpful. They certainly made sure you were welcomed and your stay was as pleasant and stress free as possible. The dining options in the hotel are okay, I had dinner at the restaurant downstairs and it wasn't bad, but a little overpriced. I suggest trying the dining options across the street for more options and affordable pricing too...except for Robuchon, but that's worthwhile.The location of the hotel has its challenges, but it can be overcome. Within walking distance there is a Mitsukoshi there. Not your largest version of one, but it does have all the adequate shopping needs, restaurants, and food market on the lowest floor. Mitsukoshi is also located within the Yebisu garden where there are a ton of restaurants, a convenience store, and a bank. I was really excited about the fact that they had 2 Joel Robuchon restaurants across the street AND a Robuchon bakery too. If you're looking to make reservations, I suggest going through the hotel concierge. The restaurant's website messed up my reservation and sent me to the wrong restaurant. It wasn't a big ordeal, just a little confusing.Ebisu station has both the JR and metro lines. Accessing both can be a walk, but along the way are a lot of automatic walkways to make the process less strenuous on the legs. The Ebisu JR station will be the first you see. From there, Shibuya is the next station, Harajuku is your 2nd station, and then Shinjuku is your 4th station. Pretty quick accesses to popular destinations. If you need the metro line, you would need to walk down further through the mall and down escalators before you hit the metro. Ebisu is only on the Hibiya line so for some destinations I had to make connections. If you want to hit tourist area, Asakusa took the longest to access, about a 40 mins trip on the metro excluding walking time.So while the location has its challenges, you can overcome them by managing your time and having a good map, which the hotel provides. The hotel's overall environment, service, and efficiency is well worth my time and money spent. Would I stay here again? Absolutely! Would I recommend this? Definitely.","San Diego, California","halo8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",24,5.0

Hotel is located in the neighborhood of Ebisu, easily accessible to the subway and JR line via the covered walkway. Ebisu is a quieter district as compared to the touristy Shinjuku and Shibuya area but it's not an issue for us since we prefer some quiet time after staying in major city centre during the entire leg of our 9 days long japan trip. The airport limousine from both Haneda and Narita airport also drop you off directly at the hotel's entrance.Check in was prompt and staff was courteous. We had an issue with our door latch upon check in. But this was resolved promptly by both housekeeping and engineering. On my last stay, we got a room facing Tokyo Tower and this time round we had a room facing Ebisu Garden. On a clear day, we can get a nice view of Mt Fuji from our room. Room is spacious, which is a plus point since most hotel rooms in Japan are typically small. Room is adequately equipped but the deco seems a bit outdated. The only downside is that there is limited selection of English Channels on the TV.Hotel has several dining options available. The nearby Ebisu Garden also provides an alternative dining option has it has several restaurants, cafe and fast food outlet available. There is also a Starbucks and small supermarket in the mall.

While I didn't get a king sized bed, the oversized single bed was fine for one person. The hotel is conveniently located across the street from shopping, dining and the train station. Taxis are also readily available at the hotel entrance. If you are traveling to the business district in the morning, taking a taxi may the quickest and easiest (but not the cheapest) option. The trains are packed in the mornings, and the streets are relatively empty and quiet. I got to the business district in 10 minutes by taxi in the mornings, but the return trip in the evenings took 30 minutes. It is a long drive from NRT using the Airport Limousine - about 2.5 hours. If you can fly into HND, it is only 30 minutes from the hotel.

Good placement of plugs around the room for charging electronic devices. It is a bit more ""old school"" looking for a Westin hotel, but nonetheless, everything you'd expect.The bar staff are helpful and speak good English (plus they make a good drink, albeit an expensive one!). Also free Wifi for hotel guests. The Westin Workout 24 hour gym is always helpful and managed to squeeze in a late night workout after dinner/drinks with the rest of my group. Also noticed that they have a new service where they provide New Balance sneakers/workout gear for those who want to pack light, but I think there's a rental fee for that. Ebisu is a nice area, although only got to walk around late Monday night. The train station is a stone's through away and the hotel is right opposite a La Robuchon, if anyone wants to indulge. There is also a Sapporo Beer Garden and lots of cafes around the area, but don't expect it to be much of a bar hopping area, especially on weeknights. Didn't get to try breakfast because we got packed boxes on the bus for an early morning flight back home.

Our sons' adjoining room was smaller but also laid out well with a desk and sitting area near the window and two full beds. Their bathroom was also smaller than ours but still nice none-the-less. Both bathrooms came with a high tech toilet seat that is popular in Japan. I loved that the seat itself had a warmer built in. Our room came with both a coffee machine and electric tea kettle. As part of having our room serviced each day, both machines would be refilled and complementary bottled water would be left on the cabinet with tea bags and coffee cups. There was also a small refrigerator. Thick cotton robes and slippers were available in the closet when we arrived as well as fresh pressed cotton nightgowns (or light robes -- I wasn't sure which but they were pretty).From the moment we checked in, everyone in the hotel was so welcoming and helpful. We have dietary limitations and on our first day, the women at the concierge desk in the lobby wrote a note for any restaurant we visited stating the items we couldn't eat. It became our life safer because many of the restaurants that we ate at had servers who didn't speak English.Our rooms included an full American and Japanese breakfast buffet. They also had a huge juice bar with freshly squeezed juices and smoothies. I loved the breakfast breads, fish (usually salmon) and salad bar (fruit salad and an amazing salmon and rocket salad that tasted so fresh.)My husband and sons loved the bread pudding. My younger son also loved that there was rice on the breakfast buffet. There is a beautiful little garden behind the hotel that has a peaceful, meandering path.Although the hotel is not in the heart of downtown Tokyo, it is centrally located and an easy walk to the Ebisu train station.

Shame they weren't willing to double check when I asked...The room was very 1980s style but well looked after and very large by Japanese standards. Lots of gold and faux French decor was very very dated. Disappointly the Westin managememt are so naive that they think it is OK to charge Y1,500/day. I suggest they have a look at some Japanese budget /business hotels (eg Toyoka Inn) which for Y5,000 room rates manage to provide wifi for no extra charge.

I contacted th hotel about an upgrade (and received one). I asked because I was a gold member so thought us was worth trying. I was sent a confirmation of the upgrade and price- based on what I reserved for in my first booking. When it came to check in, I received the upgrade and I also received the upgrade fee which when combined with what I had paid for my first reservation was more expensive than what I could book online for the same room on the day. When letting the check in staff know this it didn't seem to make a difference or register for that matter. And since I was paying not my company, I told them to cancel the upgrade. I could live without being on the executive floor. A little disappointed with the process and double information from the hotel, but lets just put that down to being their second language. The room: we stayed in one of the normal rooms. The interior is heavily influenced by classic European flavors, which can give the room a feeling of being old and outdated. It is but you can also see the effort in the room. The room is large, the bathroom is classical with a lot of marble, there is matching writing desk, makeup mirror, chest if draws, bed end chair and lounge sofa. Despite all these items the room does not in any way feel squashed. In fact, in size alone, its probably the biggest hotel room I have stayed in for this hotel chain in Japan. The interior is not my preferred cup of tea but it is still nice.The view is inhibited by an apartment block next door and gives a feeling of lost privacy but for the price we paid I can't really complain. I think the Westin in Tokyo is regarded as a category 6 SPG hotel. I personally would not say it is any higher than a level 5 but probably more like a 4.The prices for food and services within the hotel are mind boggingly expensive and should be avoided at all costs unless money is no issue and $40 for a standard burger and nearly $20 for a chocolate smoothie is normal for you. One little thing I noticed, they have a carry bag in the closet that, whilst is a nice touch was also offered at the Westin in Sendai. However there, they also offered a larger bag as well and with a wife in toe was very useful as an additional carry bag to carry all the junk she bought (I mean that in the nicest possible way).Would I recommend this hotel? Yes. Would it be a MUST stay hotel? No.Location? Fairly good, a little walk from the train staton but certainly not strenuous even with suitcases in toe.Getting there from the airport: you can take the bus shuttle but I prefer to take the train, much more comfortable and reliable.

I will stay here again on my next visit. My favorite aspect of the hotel was the 5-star breakfast, where I could have everything from Japanese pickles and a green tea smoothie to an omelette, or even bread budding with a divine and not to sweet dark chocolate sauce. Come early for breakfast--before 9--to snag a paper and a booth in the back. On Sunday morning the staff had to open a waitlist after 9:30 AM because of the crowds. The room, lobby and restaurants, although not the newest, are gleaming and seemingly without wear. There is a lovely bar next to the lobby where one can have champagne next to a waterfall. The upstairs bar is good for meeting friends or sipping a cocktail alone with a view of the city. The room was spotless and cozy with art deco furniture, with a great view of Tokyo Tower. I also liked the separate vanity to do my makeup with natural light. The bathroom had Westin toiletries--my favorite--a bath and ample plush linens. The shower was a little small, however, and I had to place my shampoo on the floor. Everything was well cared for and well serviced. We stayed on a club floor and enjoyed the afternoon happy hour, which offered appetizers, wine, cocktails and champagne. Again, come early to snag a table as a waitlist may form on weekends, as it did with us on Saturday night. The location of the hotel in unparalleled. Ebisu Garden Palace in itself has great shopping in its department stores and the best French restaurant in Tokyo is next door. Ebisu also earns high marks for convenience as it is located on both the Yamanote train line and Hibiya subway lines, making it uniquely easy to head to Shibuya, Harajuku, Shinjuku, Ginza and Roppongi. My only minor complaint concerns the concierge. She mistakenly told us that we did not need a reservation for the Roppong Hills branch for the sushi place featured in ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi."" When we arrived at the restaurant we learned that we indeed need a reservation and could not have gotten in without one. Why not at least call the branch to confirm? Luckily a nice guy added us to our reservation, or we would have been out of luck. Can't wait to go back.

I LOVED this Westin. The decor of the lobby and the room, and the furniture in the room were all to my taste. Truly five star. The room was very large and comfortable. Wi-fi was fast. We had a great view of Tokyo Tower. Stayed on the executive floor and the lounge was comfortable with good amenities-- food/drinks (although often crowded and occasionally with loud children). We had buffet breakfast (included with rate) in the lobby each morning and it was perfect. Many Japanese choices, as well as some Chinese, an omelet bar, and fresh fruits, salads, juices, smoothies and breads. It was a great way to start each morning. It's not far to the JL subway system and the staff was in general very good. My only complaint would be that the bathroom, while large, had a shower that did not have any space for toiletries --i.e. one small tray that barely held a travel-size shampoo and conditioner bottle with no room for soap, razor, comb or anything else, etc. Having said that, I would still return to this hotel and recommend it. It was definitely a cut above any other Westin where I have stayed (and I have stayed at many).","New York City, New York","GlobalGirlz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",68,5.0

So when I talk about the rooms in this review, I'll refer to two, the first, 1904 and the second, 1014.I was upgraded to a suite, 1014 on my second stay and it was very spacious, and by far, the best room that I've stayed in out of the four hotels that I've stayed in on my four trips to Japan so far this year. I didn't really have time to look around the grounds or amenities including the pool unfortunately!The decor is quite conservative with a lot of timber so very unlike a contemporary Westin but more in the Sheraton style. A little dated but well-maintained although I found the water pressure in the wash hand basins a tad low.The variety at breakfast was expansive with a choice of smoothies, my favourite! There were a variety of cuisines so something for everyone.Service as with most hotels in Japan was excellent.The Ebisu station on the JR Yamanote line was only a 10 minute amble away with the subway line underneath the JR station. I particularly liked the interior walkway through the Yebisu Gardens which was very convenient and provided shelter when the weather turned inclement.A Mitsukoshi department store was just across the road and particularly in Tokyo, these once dominant department stores were the only place to go shopping but it seems these are disappearing with the changing shopping patterns. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to look through Mitsukoshi but I will do on a future visit.The Airport Limousine Bus service is available at this hotel and runs on an hourly schedule and perhaps the only drawback of a superb service is the Westin is at the end of a run meaning you need to allow two hours for this trip whereas if you were at the other end of this service, the trip to Narita is barely an hour.","Wellington, New Zealand","RayC888</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",151,4.0

Tokyo is a late-starting city, so you'll likely be taking breakfast at the hotel. It is expensive as breakfasts go, but the food is quite good and the selection excellent. It includes a station with local pickles and such, as well as American and European selections.

One thing that struck us was how clean it is. The decor isn't new but it is so well maintained I couldn't help but be impressed. The check-in staff were pleasant and professional and I must say that the concierge staff were among the most helpful I have come across. They are really prepared for all your questions and will make their best effort to ensure your ease and satisfaction. Their F&B outlets serve food of good standard and The Compass Rose on the 22nd Floor is a great place for a drink while taking in the view of the city skyline by night. Their housekeeping is also excellent. They know what to tidy, replace and what to leave untouched. Very professional. Mind you though, if you do choose to ""Go Green"", they won't make your bed or replace your towels.All in all, I would say it is simply excellent hospitality. Oh, and the beds are a good sleep! As for the locale, from the hotel you can conveniently walk to the JR and Metro stations. It is a short stroll through Yebisu Gardens and then through a walkway with walkalators. You'll get to the Ebisu JR line station first and if you carry on you'll reach the Metro station. Ebisu is one stop from Shibuya, two from Harajuku and four from Shinjuku on the JR Yamanote Line. Across from the Westin through Yebisu Gardens, there are plenty of eateries, a good Yakitori grill and pub and conveniences. If you'd walk towards the Metro station you'll come out to a bustling area with lots of restaurants.

The rooms are enormous, especially for Tokyo and to be honest, it was great for a longer stay because you get to enjoy the amenities, even the room service food was excellent.

Exiting the station proper will bring you to a boulevard where several quaint F&B outlets + bakeries are (with great food!)There's good shopping here and a departmental store (Mitsukoshi). Walking past this boulevard will bring you to the hotel. Total travel time no more than 10 minutes - unless you stop to shop....On certain weekends, there are even farmers' markets in the boulevard.Decor / Ambience - The hotel is grand - a classic ornate European decor. Not much intimacy as the lobby is opulent and large - but the service brings back the intimacy of a comfortable luxurious hotel. The hotel is always beautifully decorated during festivals and for me, it always feel good to be back in a familiar environment ;-)Service - Staff are very polite and service is excellent. The concierge was very helpful in pointing out local events and great places to go - we watched a Sumo Wrestling where Blue Dragon (reigning champion) had his last fight before he retired - all with the help of the concierge. Staff would also offer to help the moment you look a little lost in the lobby.Room - Very spacious with large shower area. Grand wooden tables. Very comfortable beds. Comes with all the amenities. Housekeeping staff did a great job turning down the room (and cleaning it up after) Toilet Seat comes with a warmer that does you lots of good when you wake in the morning.....especially in winter. ;-)Restaurants - Again, separate reviews. But these...are a MUST try! Especially Yebisu Teppanyaki (Michelin Starred) and the Chinese restaurant - Ryotenmen.All-in-all, a great area to relax and enjoy the city.

I selected The Westin because I'm an SPG member and because it's within walking distance of my company's office in Meguro. Overall, from a business traveler's perspective, it's a perfectly adequate experience. Having stayed at many Starwood Hotels both in the US and abroad, this hotel - while very nice to look at - seemed unnecessarily ornate to me. It's a popular spot for weddings, and I can see why, as the lobby and surrounding facilities are quite fancy in appearance, very classic European. I think what you gain in opulent appearance, you lose a bit in terms of comfort and intimacy. The location is good if you want some quiet away from Tokyo's crazier spots. I'm not sure I would stay here if I were in full-on tourist mode, as it is a little more remote, but it was good for a business trip. The airport bus from Narita makes a stop here, making it very convenient if you have a lot of luggage - no need to take the train if you have $3000 yen to spend. There's a very large mall - don't worry, it doesn't look like one and you would never know it's there - with many restaurants right across the street (Thai, Japanese, Italian, Brewery, American fast food, Starbucks...) Beyond that you can access all of the many good restaurants that Ebisu has to offer. It's a very pleasant and relatively quick walk to both Meguro and Ebisu Stations, and that pretty much connects you with everything (including a lot of other reasonable food options).The room was spacious (I had two full beds with a small table, two chairs and a makeup table [a nice touch].) The bathroom was very nice, with a large separate tub and shower, the usual Japanese toilet set up, nice toiletries. The room also came equipped with a DVD player - and a rice cooker! Bring DVDs, friends, because the television options are limited unless you speak Japanese, and if you are suffering from jet lag, you might want something to watch. In room wireless was reliable and, despite the annoying sign up with prices that makes you feel like you are being charged, it's actually free (at least it was with my room.) As with many hotels, they need more outlets by the desk area (no adapters needed if you are traveling from the US). All that said, I'm not sure why but it just never felt entirely comfortable, probably because I was expecting the usual Heavenly Bed (the bed is fine, but it's not the Heavenly Bed you get in the US). It was fine, very nice, but not particularly comfortable. The housekeeping staff did a great job of keeping the room fresh, and they were very quick and friendly.The fitness center is very nice, but not included unless you are an SPG member, so sign up! Three or so treadmills, elipticals, free weights, some nice weight machines, water available. A nice, if small, gym with a pretty street view. I only missed a pool for lap swimming, but apparently there is a larger health club in the complex across the street that has one and you can access it for something like $20. The bar and restaurants are ornate and thus feel a bit less accessible. At the risk of sounding like an ugly American, it's not the type of place you're going to feel comfortable going to the lobby dressed very casually. I spent a lot of time at restaurants across the street in the large mall area, which had a more causal feel (and were decidedly less expensive.) Room service is outrageously expensive, but that is the case in most Tokyo hotels. When I did order room service, it was very good - especially the ramen!The service is very reliable and friendly; everyone works hard to speak English if you are unable to speak Japanese - but do not expect them to understand everything you say. This can be an issue if you run into more complex logistical problems beyond finding a good restaurant or getting a taxi. I was frustrated by an exchange I had around using US ATM cards* (mine didn't work in any of the surrounding ATM machines, and they kept telling me to go to the 7 Eleven, which also didn't work.) I had a hell of a time explaining over the phone to guest express what a lint roller was.On using foreign ATM cards: It's important to note that The Westin *does not* have an ATM and does not allow credit card advances or facilitate cash exchanges. I was instructed to go to 7 Eleven in Ebisu, or take US currency to the bank in the mall across the street during the week. This was hugely frustrating, as my card(s) did not work at 7 Eleven, or in any of the ATMs in the mall. I found both their guest express representative and concierge to be somewhat unsympathetic in this situation and not particularly helpful as I don't speak much Japanese. THE GOOD NEWS: There is a JP Post Office in the mall across the street (3rd floor, rear of building) and many JP Post Offices have ATMs that accept most if not all foreign ATM cards. They are open from 8am to 8pm on weekdays and also have weekend hours. The Westin staff would do well to offer this information up front, rather than sending their guests to 7 Eleven, and I found it very odd that I had to figure this out myself; after about an hour of back-and-forth, I returned to my room in frustration and consulted the back of my Time Out Tokyo guide, which provided the tip on the post office.

Even when I was waiting for the hotel shuttle after check out, I was served tea in the lobby. The staff here is generous and does not dispense service only to the staying guests of this hotel, which is another indication of their commitment to service. A casual request to a staff in the elevator for an extra key-card was taken up as a personal mission, and the same staff delivered the card to my door minutes later.

Excellent Property.This stay: 2 nights. Upgraded to the one bedroom suite on the 9th floor, with seperate living room and bedroom (it's two standard rooms together, but with a kitchen sink, which was useful), which was nice. Of course it's not comparable directly to a new hotel in terms of facilities (small gym, 80s style lobby), but the hotel management should get an A for keeping up the maintenance of this property. Nothing out of place, everything works well, and with a touch of class. I was on personal trip (no business to take care of the eastside this time) and I prefer the westside of Tokyo (Daikanyama, Omotesando, Shibuya, Harajuku, Shinjuku) to walk around and enjoy the weekend anyways, so the location was not an issue, if it wasn't even better, so no issues there. Walking escalator to Ebisu station was convienent but nothing to write home about, I found for westside destinations (Daikanyama, Omotesando, Shibuya, Harajuku, Shinjuku) the taxi fare was reasonable (JPY 800 - 2000)Pros: Comfortable, reliable, mature and responsive staff & service. Bed and bedding is Westin standard. Skip and hop to the westside Tokyo where it's about lifestyle, rather than business.Considerations: (i) location is better for westside Tokyo travellers (ii) old style (80s/90s design) compared to the newer properties in Tokyo (Shangri-la, Peninsula, Mandarin Oriental, etc), but as I said, it's has an charm all of its own which I can best describe as classy (which newness or money can't buy) - the other classy hotel I really like is the Imperial Hotel Tokyo.About me: East asian male, based in Hong Kong, travels for business and pleasure 100-150 nights a year (most Asia), SPG platinum 75","Beijing, China","lifeadventurelove</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beijing, China</strong>",23,5.0

In every instance the staff went that little bit further to provide what you requested and more. Not only attentive but enterprising and keen for us to really enjoy our stay in Tokyo, not just the hotel.In comparison to our first few nights in Tokyo at the ANA Intercontinental it was more relaxing due to being away from the hustle and bustle with far superior rooms.

From the Skywalk please remember to take the under passage at the end of the travelator on the right (Where the information counter is) instead of walking crossing the main road to Westin. This will save you energy and time.The hotel is like any other Westin nothing much to say here. Was given a room upgrade (corner room) but not on the SPG floor. Even so, the room was clean and spacious - complimentary Wifi for Gold and only 1 bottled water provided per night (if i remember correctly). If you've stayed in a Westin before, you get the same set-up - I just missed the heated toilet seats and butt washer! I am satisfied and have no flaws with hotel, I just want to point out some tips while staying here:1. There's a grocer at Mitsukoshi on the basement for snacks and drinks2. ManRyu Ramen near the basement grocer serves good Sapporo Ramen. Expect a queue.3. Westin is located off the action and a good 20min+ train ride to Tokyo Station.4.

It sits in a very nice neighborhood very close to the Ebisu train and subway stations, making everything extremely convenient and easy to get to.

I had to carry my own suit cases when I was checking in and checking out. The bell staff just did not care, especially the female staff named Hayashi at the check-out counter. She was rude and when I asked her for someone to help with luggage, she just pointed to the door and asked me to go there myself. Another female staff on the phone gave me someone else's message but turned around to accuse me of not providing certain information. (Seriously, what information besides self-identification is necessary to retrieve a message if I am calling from the room?) Although I did see a couple of staff looking helpful with Japanese-speaking guests so perhaps this hotel targets the locals. I was surprised given Japan's usually-high service standards but this hotel did not even meet international standards when it comes to dealing with foreign guests. 2) Poor location It is a far walk from the nearest train station. Even though the walkway is covered, it is a wind tunnel and extremely cold at night. Worse, hotel was not prompt in getting taxis on standby. For two consecutive weekday mornings during work hours (between 8-9am), I had to wait for about 15-20minutes in the cold with no cab. I have stayed at and visited various locations in Tokyo and never waited for more than 5 minutes for taxi. In most hotels in Tokyo, the staff would go out to the main road to get the taxis to come in but I did not see that at the Westin.

The room was VERY spacious, even in the context of China & USA, not to mention Tokyo, which relaxed me a lot. The decoration was in classic European style. It's warmly-coloured everywhere so it is not like other brands like Le Meridien which gives you cyber feel. I tried a bar in the 20-something floor. Tokyo Tower is in your eyes over there. The price is tally with a 5-star hotel but IMO it is worth trying. Surrounding area is quiet since Ebisu is not a place for entertainment. But going to and from Ebisu JR station is convenient by skywalk, the escalator network. So you don't have to walk uphill from the station to the hotel. It's definitely a value choice if you want to stay luxuriously in Tokyo.","Hong Kong, China","Michaelchs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",23,5.0

The beer museum across the street is a neat visit and it is free! The hotel itself is dated, but clean. Housekeeping was punctual and did a nice job with the room. The restaurants within the hotel are not very good at all, and should be avoided, as well as the breakfast buffet. There is a sushi restaurant that is over priced (even by Tokyo standards) and the fish was not fresh at all. The Chinese restaurant is also very expensive and the food quality did not match the price paid. A 10 minute walk from the hotel will solve those issues.

We returned to this hotel during our three-week holiday visit to Tokyo 12/25 - 1/9 because of the super location, many boutiques and stores within walking distance, tens of restaurants and transportation convenience. As the other reviewers have stated, the Ebisu Train Station is across the way from the Yebisu Garden Place (10 minute walk) with several main JR lines running out of there. You can even get to the Train Station from the underground walkway connecting from the Westin. It is so convenient if it is raining or cold out which it was when we were there. There are so many restaurants (different price levels and cuisines) within the Yebisu Garden Place and the surrounding area. Within the Place, there are many shops, a theater, and also one of the locations of Japan's oldest department store, Mitsukoshi. The Place has many office buildings including the headquarters for Sapporo Beer, one of Japan's premium beer companies as well as the Sapporo Beer Station and the Sapporo Beer Museum. The Yebisu Garden Place property was an old brewery years ago. The Hotel itself is like any other Westin Hotel, except the customer service and attentiveness of the staff are outstanding. They also treat their Starwood Points customers with even more care. The front desk staff already knows when you arrive if you are Starwood Member. It's great! You feel really special as soon as you check in! The front desk staff all speak English very well. When we requested for a late check out on our day of departure, it was no problem and no hassle. We needed to use the Business Center and use their Internet. They usually give out free 15 minute passes, but when we needed an extra 15 minutes, it was not an issue. Also, this Hotel is one of the handful of designated stops for the Limousine Bus to and from Narita Airport. You can buy the Limousine Bus tickets at the front desk or Express Desk in the Lobby. The beds are awesome as they are their branded ""Heavenly Beds"". We took the option of an extra USD 80 a day upgrade for access to the Executive Club Lounge. They served breakfast (both western and Japanese) until 9:30am, then snacks and refreshments (including alcohol) all day and into the evening. The view from the Lounge level was beautiful, especially in the evening. You could see the Tokyo skyline with all the lights including the Tokyo Tower and the Tokyo Skytree. It was well worth it as the food and beverage at the Hotel tends to be on the expensive side. As one of the other reviewers noted, we were also not impressed with their buffet. At one lunch, we order from the a la carte menu and it was even more expensive and not even that great. Although, their bakery and desserts are top notch. If you are going to have something to eat at the Hotel, I recommend having a coffee or tea and dessert/cake. We found them to be delicious. There were a few other downsides to the Hotel such as it was not as new as it was when we stayed the first time. I guess that is normal wear and tear for a hotel such as this. Some examples, although, the bathrooms are beautiful, you can still notice they could use a spruce up. The furniture in the room was fine, but it could use an upgrade or a freshen up. I also noticed that some attention to detail in the cleaning of the upholstery could have been better. There weren't any stains or anything gross, but I noticed that the sides between the sofa cushions could have been vacuumed better and the wood polished. The Fitness Center does not have a pool, you have to go to the fitness center in the Yesibu Garden Place to go for a swim. I know I sound to be demanding, but when you pay upwards of $600-700 a night or more, I expect every detail to be taken care of. But, with that said, we would absolutely stay at the Westin Tokyo again next time. It is an awesome location because everyone in Tokyo knows where it is and my friends and family were able to come visit us with ease.",,Rangerblue19,2,4.0

If what was presented at this buffet was 1/2 the price, the hotel would still have made a substantial profit!

I was accompanied by two team mates to the trip. We had three separate rooms and I was accompanied by my wife.I stayed in Westin from 8th July to 22nd July 2012. The stay in the hotel was not something I would remember fondly. I was driven to write this review because I could compare my stay with Cerulean Tower Tokyo hotel in which I stayed from June 22nd to July 8th, right before I shifted to Westin. Decent décor , fancy carpeting, smiling faces of the staff , polite good mornings and acknowledgements, clean rooms is something that we all have come to expect from top end hotels. (After all they are charging you for this). You would find that the same is here as well. But being customer-focused demands something more than these mechanical ( read superficial ) aspects. This is what makes you truly feel like a guest in the hotel and not some client who is merely occupying a room.Apart from many other small things I would like to call out the following incident that would highlight how Westin failed to grab a chance to really impress.On day of our checkout we packed our bags early and left the room about 1000 hrs. A female attendant came to our room to collect our luggage. Some of the bags were heavy to we helped her out. With luggage done we completed the formalities at the checkout counter and took a stroll at the departmental stores nearby ( Yebisu Garden ). At 11:30 we boarded the bus to Narita and reached the Airport around 1:30 PM. To our horror we figured out that we have missed one bag in the room :(.Series of events1. Called the hotel to confirm that the bag is in the room : for whole 3 hours after the checkout the hotel had still not swept the rooms.2. We had to call 4-5 times and wait for 20 minutes before some one to actually confirm that the bag was indeed in the room3. Lady on the phone was very prompt in replying that it would cost us 27000 JPY for the bag to be sent via taxi to airport. Consider this : I stayed in the hotel for a total of 15 days and our bill ( for me and my team) came out to be JPY 1,080,000. The hotel failed to extend their support and absorb 27000 yen (2.5% of the total bill) but instead asked me to payI did not ask the hotel to send the bag via taxi fearing that bag may arrive late. I later requested the Hotel to ship the bag to me via EMS service to India which cost me (11000 yen + 1000 yen as handling charge from hotel :) )Why did I expect the hotel to pay in the first place .. Here is why … during my stay in one of the Taj resorts later this year I forgot my driving license in the room itself ( yes I should be more careful). The hotel returned by license to my home address without ever hinting that they are expecting me to bear the cost for my mistake.Which type hotel would you chose is anyone's guessOther comparison I can call out1. Room service speed ( cerulean clear winner with very very impressive response time)2. Pool and other facility are available within the hotel premises in Cerulean 3. View from the cerulean was fantastic ( we stayed in the 32nd floor)  I have made another visit to Tokyo and insisted my travel desk to not book Westin. I stayed in Cerulean and Anna IntercontinentalWestin is indeed , from the look and the tariff a 5 star but need to be more sensitive to delight factor than just the functional aspect.

Yes, it's outside any bustling tourist areas like Shibuya or Shinjuku, but that's actually a POSITIVE thing in my opinion, and it's so ridiculously easy to get anywhere in Japan via transit that the location shouldn't even garner a second thought.As others have noted it's at the far end of a plaza/mall which, initially, seemed to me pretty desolate and lackluster. Upon arriving from Shinagawa Station we walked above ground, and by that route you only see a few quiet shops, especially at night. However like most everything in Tokyo there are several sprawling underground levels to the plaza so there really are quite a number of stores, and it's a pleasantly quiet experience compared to the malls and plazas adjoined to most of the major train and subway stations. Note that it's also possible to stay completely inside on the journey from Shinagawa Station to the hotel; just turn right and descend the escalator at the end of the ""skywalk"" instead of crossing the street. That will take you to a lower level of the plaza which has an entrance to the basement level of the hotel - very handy for rainy days. Note also the walk is pretty far whichever route you take - the hotel website says 7 minutes but that's optimistic even for a fast walker like me. It's closer to 10-15 minutes, which isn't a problem for everyone but should be a consideration for anyone who is perhaps older and not as mobile as they'd like to be.The hotel itself was great, the staff was friendly, rooms were spacious and comfortable, A/C worked well (yes, I'm the type who runs the A/C in winter!), and most notable it's exceptionally quiet. I'm pretty sure the hotel was completely booked most of the nights we stayed and I never heard a single sound from any of the neighboring rooms, nor from traffic in the hall.I ate at the restaurant only once and it was mediocre (the lobby ""deli restaurant""), and we also had lounge access which was just OK for breakfast, but not outstanding. I booked a room with lounge access because that was the only room available, but despite the relatively few food offerings I probably would book again. It's nice to have a place to chill out at the end of the day to use wifi, have a complimentary few glasses of wine, etc.Overall I really enjoyed my stay and would absolutely recommend and stay again.","San Francisco, CA","pw_sf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, CA</strong>",155,5.0

But to score a 5, a hotel should know what it's target is, and should hit it bullseye. The Westin Tokyo does that. I'm a frequent visitor to Tokyo, and even that experience does not make Tokyo an easy place for a non-Japanese speaker. There are other nice western-flavored hotels in Tokyo, the Westin certainly isn't the only one (and it is not the lushest of them). But here's what the Westin has going for it:1. Value: The Westin, by Tokyo standards, is a deal. Obviously rates vary, but I've often paid more at comparable hotels for less.2. Rooms: lovely. Not over the top or modern-slick in any way, but all the right comforts, including multiplug electric. (Don't come expecting stark / clean Japanese design style-- that's not the Westin's style).3. Here's the big one: EXCELLENT CONCIERGE. When you're a gaijin (foreigner) in Tokyo, you need help finding things and getting around. I can honestly say that in all my travels, I have never encountered a concierge desk that so consistently exceeded my expectations. Example: every restaurant I booked, they prepared a package for me containing Japanese language map and directions (for a taxi driver, if I was to take a taxi), and English language map and directions (for me, using the subway). Sure, most hotels would provide this information if you ASKED for it, but every request I made of the Westin's concierge people was met with similar forethought-- (handing a Tokyo taxi driver English map and directions is about as useful as handing me a Japanese subway map, and they did not want to take chances). It's just a small example, but so emblematic of everything they did for me during the week.ONE NOTE ABOUT THE POOL: It's not in the hotel, but in an adjacent health club. It's fine for a serious lap swimmer, but it's not very convenient, it's run with a rules-heavy-hand (ie bathing caps, one-way swim lanes, etc. etc. etc.), and it would be a definite downer if you were traveling with kids expecting a cooling dip in the pool. I can't say they are prohibited, but they would surely stretch the limited sense of humor of the pool's overseers.All in all, this recent visit made me slightly regretful that for many years, I've wandered from five star hotel to five star hotel in Tokyo, liking them all but loving none of them. . . I could just have stayed at the Westin.","West Hollywood, California","327ernests</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Hollywood, California</strong>",70,5.0

They don't have a pool actually in the hotel, but, as a SPG member, one can use the good quality one in the spa/gym in the adjoining shopping complex, which you can get to via an underground tunnel, without going outside - absolutely fine in my book.The hotel is pretty well located, given it's in Ebisu Garden City, a large shopping complex, with a good range of restaurants both high and low end (there's many more good choices within 10 mins) and a large Mitsukoshi department store. Transport is easy enough, being close to Ebisu station, which can take you easily to most places, and only one stop (or a short taxi race) to Shibuya, which also connects to everything. It's easiest access is from Hameda airport (for train change at Shinagawa for Ebisu) , but you can get the train to Narita from Shinagawa. There are also relatively cheap airport buses, but the times didn't happen to work for me.Yes, this hotel does seem expensive by Western standards, but actually it's pretty reasonable for Tokyo, especially given the size of the rooms.

For the duration of our stay they never once let the tissue box or bathroom tissue roll run below half full so there was no risk we would ever be out. I know this might sound like a minor, silly detail but I was suitably impressed, though I did wonder and worry if they just threw out those half full rolls and boxes! They also very nicely rearranged things on the bathroom counter to make things more ergonomic for us. All the staff we encountered were exceedingly polite and friendly. We love the hospitality in Japan, which is why we keep returning.The hotel is about a 10-minute walk from the Ebisu station but the connecting sky walk with the moving walkways makes it an efficient trip. The 2 main train lines at Ebisu Station are the JR Yamanote line and the Hibisu subway line which were sufficient for accessing the rest of Tokyo.

Executive floor about $50 more a day but has good breakfast and excellent evening appetizers/drinks. I rented a bicycle from the hotel each morning to ride through a nearby park (Yoyogi) and door staff carefully explained safest route to avoid car traffic and educate me about bike etiquette in Japan.Location is not great....five subway stops from Ginza and Harajuku, and about two hours from Narita on the airport bus, which is slow but a greatt deal at 3,000 yen (about $38). Across from hotel is the Mitsukoshi Center, which has the BEST gourmet food court in its basement. Center also has a Starbuck's (although never got wifi to work there, unlike US or Europe, where it connects automatically when you are nearby) and Photography Museum, which was terrific. JR (Japan Railway) and other subway stops are at least 10 minutes away and system is confusing at first, but people were very helpful. I bought a day pass each day for about $10 which was definitely worth it. I saw almost everything I wanted to see in Tokyo in five days, but daytrips to Mt Fuji were booked and require a 12 hour commitment, much of it on bus and in traffic, so I missed that. Also, late August/early September was humid and often rainy...I will go back at a different time of the year. The parks in Tokyo are beautiful...Ueno especially, but also Imperial Gardens, Yoyogi, Rikugien, and others.

The room was very quiet and given the business-oriented clients, it was a relaxing environment. They have us the Green Option to get 500 SPG points / night if we skipped housekeeping, so we took that offer for 1 night and had housekeeping come the following night.Gold Amenity - I got the 250 SPG points and took the free internet option (saving myself about $20/day). You just sign on as if you're paying for it, but they will not charge you on the bill.Concierge - We had a few requests and they came up a bit short. First, we asked them if the sushi restaurant Daiwa in the fish market took credit cards and she initially told us yes. But when I asked if she were sure, she then took time to actually check and found out they did not. Additionally, I inquired if they could help arrange a sumo wrestling practice (given that sumo is only immediately available during the tournaments), but they told us it was not available. I'm still not sure that's correct as I've read several accounts of people being able to go to see the unadvertised training / practice sessions.Location - as people have said before, it's a bit of a walk to the metro stations. If you want the JR line (connecting to Shibuya, Harajuku, Shinjuku), then it's about 10 minute walk from the hotel (including 5 minutes inside the station). If you want the Tokyo Metro Hibya line (connecting Roppongi, Ginza), then it's an additional 5 minutes through the station to the other side where you encounter all the restaurants in downtown Ebisu.Metro notes: For those that don't know, there's 2 separate metro lines (run by different companies). You can use 1 single metro card (which includes a 500 JPY card deposit) that card works on both the JR Lines as well as the Tokyo Metro lines as well as buses and convenience stores. You swipe when you enter, then swipe when you exit and it charges the card based on the distance you traveled. Hotel food - we didn't eat at the hotel, instead electing to eat in Ebisu (great fatty ramen place about 3 minutes past the subway station). However, the breakfast buffet was pretty highly recommended though I hate paying $30-40 USD/person for eggs and pancakes.Check out - went very smooth. We purchased the Limosine bus tickets from the hotel and they just included it on the bill.

Turn down service wasn't done and lights were off, making us search in the dark for a light switch. After the lights were on we noticed several carpet stains and one of the curtains were broke with the handle just laying on the floor. Second major issue i have is the internet service. They charge $25 dollars per day PER DEVICE! Between my wife and I, we have 3 devices that we need internet service for business.... that $75 extra per day!TV here is not nearly as good as most hotels in its class. They only have a few English channels, no movie channels, and the TV quality is of one I would expect at a best western. Also, how the room is setup, you cant view the TV from the bed or the couch; it faces the window..... Why in the world would you setup a room like this?Concierge wasn't particularly helpful. I have a free day that i wanted to look at a tour of Tokyo or go to Mt Fuji. When i inquired about this, the concierge simply pointed to one brochure on her desk, then proceeded to look down at her desk as if that was all the help she was going to give. I looked over the brochure, but wanted to inquire about other things to do around the hotel area. We were told that they were busy and would call us back in our roomsThe next day, I was walking around the hotel and noticed they had a cigar bar. As a cigar aficionado who only gets to smoke cubano cigars when on international trips, i was excited to say the least. After lighting my cigar, the attendant came over and quickly shoo'd us out, asking us to go to the bar area. Not sure what we did wrong, we quietly left and headed to the bar area she asked us to go to. When arriving at the bar area, the waitress told us we were not allowed in due to ""dress code"". I am wearing Nautica short khakis, a Nautica button down shirt, clean shoes and properly groomed. My wife was wearing a skirt, blouse and high heels. After being asked to leave the cigar bar and the regular bar, we ended up going outside feeling insulted. There were 4 other gentlemen in the cigar bar, and plenty of other people in the bar that were far less dressed than us. We couldn't help feeling insulted, as none of the Japanese patrons were treated this way. We were always very courteous and respectful. We did nothing to warrant this type of treatment! We hadn't had time to say a word in the cigar bar before being shoo'd away, and never allowed in the normal bar. I cant understand why we were treated this way, other than we are American. We have traveled all over the world, staying at all types of 3-5 star hotels. We have NEVER been treated this way! After having enough, my wife politely asked to speak with the hotel manager. She respectfully explained all the issues, and informed him that we felt severely insulted. The manager was apologetic and offered free breakfast in their restaurant; but we felt we would receive the same treatment that we had already experienced in the other areas of the hotel. There are some nice things about the Hotel. The beds are very comfortable, the view was good, bathroom was nice, lobby was beautiful, and the location was decent for our working area of Tokyo. There is a small shopping area next to it and close to the subway station.Unfortunately, the positives don't out weigh the poor service and horrible experience we received. I cant in good conscious recommend this hotel to American guest. We will be removing this hotel from our companies ""recommended hotel list"" for our employees, and will not return to this hotel again.","Seattle, Washington","Melbyfamily</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",67,1.0

The hotel concierge was very helpful, and they were great at giving us directions (the bellman even typed our restaurant address into the GPS of the cab driver). It was a snap getting to the hotel and back to Narita via the Friendly Limousine Bus, although its too bad that the Westin is the last stop of the five or so hotels serviced on that route.

Yes it's a bit of a journey, but it's on the skywalk which is covered and there are people movers to help speed things up.Room- we were on the club level so we had a sparkling huge room with an amazing view of the Tokyo tower. Bathrooms were good- we got a kick out of the toilet/bidet. I like that it makes swishing sounds when you first sit down. Very nice when you have to share a room... The Japanese never disappoint- beds were comfy and the room was very clean.Location- in a business/residential area. It's not loud or filled with tourists walking around. There are some restaurants nearby. If you want nightlife interaction, walk down to the Ebisu station where there are some bars and restaurants that stay open late (we found places open at 1am on a Tuesday night). Shibuya is the next station over or you can take a taxi (about $20 USD w/traffic). If you can, utilize the trains- it's easy and efficient but only run until about 12:30am. Just learn the difference between the JR line and Tokyo metro.Since we were out late the trains were closed then the skywalk was too...we had to walk on the street back to the hotel. Not a problem for 2 girls- we felt totally safe by ourselves. The hotel is connected to an indoor mall so it is very convenient. One of my fave places was the little market (like Family Mart, can't remember the name) for snacks. I loved the hand rolls and they were less the $2 USD each. Perfect to grab on the way to the train station.Staff- was friendly. Concierge is very helpful with directions. There is a map for anything you need with door to door instructions.Wifi- we just used the free wifi in the lobby. Connection was good. Getting there--From Narita Airport- take the train/Narita Express. It's a little intimidating but easy to do! It's about $35 1 way- if you can buy the JR Rail Pass. You must buy this before entering the country (totally worth it!). It's about a 1 1/2 hour ride total. If you are paying by credit card (AMEX) you need to go to the window to pay- I could not use the machine.Get off on Shibuya and then go to the Yamanote Line (green). The trains are frequent so it's about a 5 minute wait. Ride to Ebisu (it's a short ride--I think it might be 1-2 stops from there). Find signs to the skywalk. You'll walk for about 10 minutes. There will be many signs for the Westin and Yebisu Garden Place. If you get lost then go to the information desk at the train station for directions! Don't wing it...a lot of the staff do speak English and will help you. Cost- we had a deal through a family member that works for Starwood. I saw that our room was about $375 USD. For the amount of space and amenities I feel that this is a fair cost to stay at the Westin. I stayed 1 night in Shibuya at a budget motel for $150 (through expedia, regular cost was $220/night) and it was a closet. Our room in westin fit 3 people comfortably. I would come back again.","Long Beach, California","kristyb562</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Beach, California</strong>",79,5.0

I have absolutely no complaints about the hotel. The rooms are clean, the hotel was very well kept and everyone was very helpful. Only bad thing is that the hotel is so far from the metro. Most of the walking is covered. From the hotel, you have to walk through the Ebisu Garden (which is quite lovely actually) and from there, once you enter the station, you have to take maybe 4-5 moving walk ways before you end up at the JR Yamanote line. If you want the Hibisu line, it's even further away. To get to the JR, I would say it took us about 7-10 minutes. Only upside is that the walk is almost entirely covered so if it's raining, it's not too big a deal.

First off, we were greeted by name during check in (thank you, Ms. Mirei Ri, for remembering me) and, as SPG members, upgraded to a corner room on a higher floor. Though weather makes it unpredictable, when the sky is blue, you get a great view from any side.Then, there are the concierges - who are just terrific. Ms. Matsuura, Ms. Numakura, and Ms. Konishi really spent their time and effort on each and every one of our requests, getting us great tables at popular restaurants and making spot-on suggestions for our outings. When my wife told them that she wanted to take a cooking class at the ABC Cooking Studio in Tokyo Midtown, they not only made all the arrangements for her, but went out of their way to get her an apron (actually two - so she could choose, and they ironed them first) to use during the class. And all done with a smile and genuine interest in how we enjoyed whatever they had arranged for us.One can and should expect a pretty high level of service across the board in Japan, but we really appreciate those little things that, to our mind, help make a stay at the Westin Tokyo a memorable experience.","Los Angeles, California","senorburrito</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",33,5.0

Never before been to Tokyo and therefore didn’t know what to expect from location, now I can say that Ebisu and nearby Daikanyama are very cool areas for both shopping and having drinks in the evening. Not so crowded and loud as overrated Roppongi and Ginza but with great restaurants, bars and some serious shopping (specially Daikanyama). Now back to the hotel. It is old Europe style of hotel with perfect service and food. I noticed few comments on style of the hotel, many of Westin hotels are more conservative style hotels but this type in addition is very popular in Japan as everything coming from Europe and USA. Rooms are very specious for Japanese standards, clean and for sure not outdated. I have been on 11th, non smoking floor, and room was spotless, really nothing to say negative. I stayed in many modern, new and progressive hotels that needed refurbishment only few years after opening. On top of room price they include a lot of taxes incl 10% service charge which increase overall price (wasn’t aware of that). Concierge Masako was very helpful with very good reco for sushi bar, one of nicest concierge I encountered around world. I was there during golden week and both lobby bar and breakfast were overcrowded, you have to apply for waiting list for lobby bar in the afternoon, obviously very popular, not sure is it always like that or just due to holidays. Traditionally you pay for internet and there is no discount for more days which is only thing I regret, wireless in the lobby is for free though.Both metro and JR stations are 10 min from the hotel and you can use moving escalators to speed your walking, good thing is that from the hotel you go directly via underground passage to the station, very usefully if it is raining which I experienced.Yebisu garden place in front of the hotel is nice combination of shopping and some restaurants incl few breakfast options as Westin breakfast if you don’t have it in your rate is more then 30 EUR. I used limousine bus from airport to the hotel and it took hour and half to get to the hotel. Found it very convenient as transfer to and from airport. I took return ticket where you get 2 days metro pass (pls note that in Tokyo you have two metro operators, one is private with four lines and this pass is not valid for private one).Overall very good experience and would stay there again.","Zagreb, Croatia","marr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Zagreb, Croatia</strong>",48,5.0

We knew nothing about the neighborhood so let me start from scratch. If you are staying here, fly into Haneda which is only a 30 minute taxi ride away ($USD 90) but still much easier than getting to the hotel from Narita which is 2 hours + drive away. The hotel is gorgeous, we loved the marble and the columns and it feels very European. The check in staff and the concierge staff were some of the best we encountered on our three week Asian tour. The room was lovely and we had a great view of the Tokyo Tower out of the window. Room service on our final day was fantastic; a young man delivered a club sandwich and fries to my room;, took off his shoes before entering the room, bowed, brought in the food, bowed, went to the door, turned around, bowed again and then put his shoes on and left! The service and courteousness of all the Japanese people we encountered in Tokyo helped us to fall in love with the city. The room had a great shower, and a heated toilet seat with built in bidet which is intimidating at first but once you use it, you will love it! After the primitive holes in the ground we encountered in China, all the toilets in Tokyo were amazing! The hotel is right across the street from a mall with nice restaurants and a Starbucks, great for breakfast as the hotel breakfast is very expensive. The train station is right there and you have access to both the JR and the subway so convenient, and so easy to use. It's close to Rappongi (one stop on the train away) for night life and on the same line as the Ginza district which is great especially at night. The only negative is that the downstairs bar permitted smoking, which meant we did not use it. Highly recommended!","Miami, Florida","mwooduk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",656,5.0

In total I stayed for 7 nights and after spending each day walking around Tokyo it was always a delight to come 'home' to the Westin. The staff were friendly and helpful and in particular the house-keeping staff serviced my room beautifully. If you are a woman staying at the Westin on your own make a note to ask about the 'women only' floor on level five. It was lovely and quiet and security was never an issue. I often relaxed in the lobby and took advantage of the free wi-fi - the lobby staff always made me feel welcome to lounge around at my own will. The location is excellent, within easy walking distance to Ebisu station. I often went to the fantastic food hall in the Mitsukoshi department store across the road from the hotel - the takeaway salads are the best I have had in a long time. The supermarket is also very well stocked for those familiar items you want to take back to your hotel room. Mitsukoshi itself was a great place to purchase quality gifts to take home.

After staying at the Sheraton on our last trip, which we found to be merely adequate with a poor location, we decided we would give the Westin a try. Although we found the Westin expensive at 26,000 yen, it was still cheaper than the Hilton Tokyo. As a SPG Platinum member, we were upgraded to the executive floor (unfortunately no suites were available) and provided access to the executive lounge. Our room was larger than expected and featured a superb view of the city. The accommodations were pleasant, bed was comfortable and housekeeping staff did a wonderful job.The executive lounge was very good, but not great. The evening drinks and appetizers ran from 5:30 - 7:30 pm and featured wine, beer, and cocktails plus some appetizers. I found the appetizers to be somewhat disappointing considering the fact that I've stayed at other hotels in Japan where the lounge will rotate the food options, but they don't seem to here. The smoked salmon was very good and the soups (I really enjoyed the pumpkin soup) were excellent. They also featured a selection of cheeses, salad, and small plates of shrimp. It was nice that you could serve yourself beer, wine or mixed drinks (some lounges require you to order it from the servers) and although the selections were limited, I never had an issue with them running out of anything. The staff in the lounge was also very friendly and helpful. Finally, the breakfast was also very good featuring delicious fruit (the melon was outstanding) a few hot items, cereal, and a selection of pastries. They have an excellent coffee machine that brews a strong cup of coffee. I must add that the lounge is rather large and I never had a problem finding a seat.Aside from the lounge we spent a bit of time in the bar downstairs, which is an awesome vintage, 1950's style bar with high ceilings and vintage furniture. Just a lovely space, and one where you can relax in for hours. I also stopped in at their cigar room (yes they do have one!) which features an expansive selection of cigars, almost all cuban, with surprisingly reasonable prices for Tokyo. The staff there was also very friendly and there are a few chairs inside where you can enjoy your cigar and order cocktails if you with.The only negatives of my experience were at the concierege desk. On several occasions I was told incorrect information and/or steered to a decision that was not the best one to make. First, we wanted to have lunch at Joel Robuchon's restaurant La Table across the street. I did not bring a jacket on the trip, but we knew the restaurant was the casual version, so we asked the concierge if it was formal dress. She stated, ""yes, La Table is a formal French restaurant and you must wear a jacket."" After hearing this we decided against going there. However, just to check we stopped in at the restaurant itself and the hostess said the restaurant was casual and we did not need a jacket. On another occasion, we asked the staff how to get to the Hilton Tokyo using the train. The concierge said that taking the train was not recommended and we would have to take the Yamanote Line and get off at the Shinjuku stop and walk over 20 min though huge crowds to get to the hotel. In stead we ended up taking a 3,000 yen taxi, which we preferred not to do. What she didn't tell us was that you can take the Tokyo Metro Line with one connection that takes you to Nishi-Shinjuku and the station is actually connected to the Hilton! We were very displeased by not being told this information.I must add that we spoke to a different person a day earlier, who was much more knowledgeable and gave us some great restaurant recommendations in the Ebisu area. We tried both of her rame restaurant recommendations (Kohmen and Ippudo) and both were fantastic. In any case, we had a very comfortable stay at the hotel, but we were very displeased by the information received at the concierge desk.","Alexandria, Virginia","volkswankin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alexandria, Virginia</strong>",55,4.0

The room service came with a white tablecloth and a vase of a beautiful pink flower. But the location. The Tokyo Westin is located in Ebisu Garden, which is essentially a commercial district. There is a Mizuho bank, a big 5-floor department store (Mitsukoshi), a drug store, several top class bakeries, and next to the bank, most recently, is a place that serves 8 kinds of highly eccentric soft serve ice cream, including yuzu and black sesame seed. Ebisu Garden is adjacent to the train station, and you must pass through six or so flat escalator-walkways to get from the train station to the Ebisu Garden. There are many clothes stores, though the prices are not particularly cheap, which is seeming in such a place, including Armani Exchange and others. The service within the hotel is superb, there are maps for the train system, various parts of the city, restaurant guides, et cetera. There is laundry service available. The bathrooms are enormous, and comes with a digital scale. The view is incredible, picturesque Tokyo, even with the illuminated red Tokyo Tower in many rooms. The TV has a music option, with Easy Listening, J-Pop, Classical, and more. And of course you can watch Japanese news. Most highly advised that you check this place out for yourself, Ebisu Garden Place is a thriving gem!","Honolulu, Hawaii","aktyer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",1,5.0

Rooms are spacious, which is a welcome change in Tokyo, but feel so outdated. The quaint little vanity unit with 3 panel make up mirror and stool was like something from a childhood doll house. The bed is super comfy, and the rooms are very quiet. Mine had a view of Tokyo Tower, others have a Mt Fuji view - only useful when the weather is exceptionally clear (about 25% of the time, I'm told).The location is very convenient.

The room and bathroom were extremely spacious, with plenty of room for two people to move around, get ready, etc. A coffee maker and kettle are provided in the room.Every lady I interacted with at the concierge desk was immensely helpful, with restaurant recommendations, directions, maps, tour reservations, and airport bus reservations.

You’ll need to walk to the other side of the metro to find a more lively scene. The Westin is very close to both the Ebisu Metro and JR lines though, and there's no shortage of taxis out front at every hour of the day and night (I had to catch one at 4:30 am with no reservation, and it was no problem). There are plenty of restaurants and food options located just across the street. Try the St Germain bakery on the other side of the plaza, they have a delicious green tea muffin stuffed with red bean paste, as well as many other excellent pastry items. The lower floor of the department store which has the typical Japanese department store array of delicious cuisines and also a supermarket with everything you might need. This Westin was also one of the quietest hotels I've ever stayed in.

The happy hour at the executive lounge is a great perk for paying a little extra as there is a large selection of spirits/beers/wines and canapes (between 5pm and 7pm from memory). The staff are attentive and very helpful. You can rent a bike for either 2000 yen for 3 hours or 3000 yen for a whole day if you are up to exploring the city on wheels.There is a Mitsukoshi department store across the road and an underground food court, but other than that, you need to walk and explore a little to get more eating options.

This means it is entirely possible to arrive here from Narita airport without stepping outdoors (Narita Express to Shinagawa, transfer to JR to Ebisu station, then walk to hotel)- Fast elevators- Quiet rooms (i.e., good sound insulation)One thing to be aware of is this hotel does not make you feel like you're in Japan. There's little to the decor that is Japanese. Even the toilets do not have the spray/bidet feature. If you're looking for a Japanese-style property, you'll be disappointed.

Also, they were considerate enough to customize dishes to make it palatable to a vegetarian. The gym and other facilities inside the property were also first class.The one small dampener was the fact that the in-hotel kitchen shut down by midnight because of the power saving initiatives done by the Japanese government post the nuclear meltdown.. hence if you end up working late in office, it is best to get some grub from outside before coming back to the hotel...

The airport limousine bus stops at the hotel, but beware that the hotel is the last stop coming from the airport, and the first stop going to the airport, meaning that you'll be riding all over Tokyo for an hour before finally getting on the highway to the airport.I didn't try any of the restaurants at the Hotel, but I did use the club lounge quite frequently.

Good service is a given at most hotels in Japan, where competition is brutal and people can expect to be treated well, but the level of gracious service that I have been receiving at the Westin is so outstanding, I feel compelled to write this review to make sure others know of this gem of a hotel.First, the staff is friendly, warm, helpful and bilingual. They will remember you quickly and help is never more than a question away. In particular, I have used the Concierge Desk very extensively and their 'service with a smile' attitude just shines through. On this trip, I bombarded Ms. Matsuura from the Concierge Desk with multiple restaurant reservation requests, and she always came through with impressive table locations or private rooms. Given that most people in the center of Tokyo eat out often, having a reservation at a popular spot is a necessity. I commend Ms. Matsuura to her management as an exemplary representative of the hotel, and hope that they will recognize her (and her colleagues) for the great job that they do.Second, the rooms are spacious, clean and lavishly furnished. I sometimes work from my hotel room, and many Japanese hotel rooms can become a bit claustrophobic, which is not an issue at all at the Westin.Third, the location is, for me, very convenient. It is a supportable walk (using the enclosed people-mover walkway) to both the Yamanote Line train and the Hibya Line subway. I also enjoy the many restaurants, bars, and shops in the area between the hotel and the station. In particular, we love a small Italian pizzeria called Da Pasquale, a block's walk from the hotel.In sum, it's a happy coincidence that my company's Tokyo office is in Ebisu, as that has allowed me to get to know the wonderful service and impressive facilities at the Westin.David Miyamoto'A Happy Guest'","Los Angeles, California","senorburrito</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",33,5.0

Thisntime, it was even more special. My family and I checked in one day before the big earthquake. This is probably our 8 or 9th time staying here so everything was usual until the earthquake hit. We have a 5 year old and a 15 month old and we were in their elevator going up to our floor and the elevator suddenly got shaky, stopped momentarily and moved again. It stopped and it's door was opened on the next floor, and first we thought the elevator was broken. We all rushed out with our kids and realized the whole building was shaking and swinging, the elevators were banging loudly... I'm from California and somewhat used to earthquake and first thought it wasn't a big deal. But it didn't take me too long to realize this one is big. There was a small table in front of the elevators so we rushed our kids underneath and within seconds, I see hotel staffs assigned on each floor to assist anyone who needs help. When it finally got calm down, we were assisted with three staffs to walk down and out of the building safely. They definitely knew what to do and prepared for any emergencies. Everyone was out, including all staffs with their indoor uniform on and it was quite windy and chilly at that time but everyone was doing their job with smile on their face taking very good care of each and every guests there. Safety inspection took about an hour or more and staffs took all available chairs, blankets, sheets and even towels out making sure guests are being taken care of. They started serving hot teas, distributing bottled water... I was also so impressed how calm and orderly Japanese guests were.When guests were allowed back into the lobby, it became late afternoon and they started serving hor d'oeurvres and pastries making sure guests comfortable. They realized many shops and restaurants in the area are closed, and they started serving all guests at their buffet restaurant around the clock on the house! They were even apologetic for food quality not at their top shape due to it's ""emergency"". Food was fine. Very good.Every single one of the staffs took so good care of each guests, we felt safe even with 2 little kids traveling with us. We left Tokyo 3 days after the earthquake, and we had a very good stay and enjoyed the neighborhood just as we always had.I believe their assistant manager was in charge of dealing with this incident right after the earthquake and he was very professional and showed great leadership. My wife wanted to send a thank you letter but can't remember his name. Tall Japanese guy with short, almost shaved hair. Well, thank you and thank you everyone at Westin Tokyo making us feel at home every time we visit.","Yorba Linda, California","IVsystem</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yorba Linda, California</strong>",53,5.0

Because I pay my hotel bills by myself as a leisure traveller the price of the stay does matter and I looked also for other hotels. At he time I was travelling I found The Westin Tokyo cheaper although I calculated what to get as a Hilton D member compared to Starwood Basic member. So I found some hints in here Tripadvisor how somebody has uppgraded her room at a very reasonable price. So I asked at the reception how much the uppgrade would be and it was much more expensive than I supposed it to be. When I got my room I was very happy that I did not pay more for uppgrade because my room was really wonderful and luxurious. Because there was shopping center very near to hotel I arranged my own executive lounge by shopping very nice and fresh food from Mitsukoshi. I even get information about the Sushi varities from always friendly japanese people who were customers in that store without asking. Thank you again because the food was excellent!To me it took one day to recover of the flight from Finland to Tokyo but after that I was ready to use the train and metro system of Tokyo. But it In Ebisu the distance to stations from the hotel was quite reasonable because I like to walk around in foreign cities.So before this stay my best hotel experience was Hilton Tokyo at the Executive Floor.Now I can say that The Westin hotel experience was equal fabulous even though I was staying at the Starwood Preferred Guest floor. My brother has the Platinium card of Starwood and although I have been i many Starwood hotels with him I naturally get no points in order to get a higher Starwood card. Actually the distance between these hotels is not so big as I thought before my trip.So what did this hotel so excellent? Of course my room but also the staff who worked very nicely staying at the background. They were all the time available but not intrusive. I think that the Westin Tokyo did everything that hotel can in order to make my visit so comfortable. Thank you again! So if you have to choose between these two hotels I'm very convinced that both are so excellent that if you will get a good deal and the location is good for you so do not have to look no further.,"Finland, Helsinki","Connectingpassengers</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Finland, Helsinki</strong>",55,5.0

I travel pretty frequently and have stayed at numerous Starwood hotels and I have to say that the service provided here was second to none. It probably didn't hurt that I was a Platinum member.Even prior to my arrival, the staff helped me with several requests I had in regards to the room. I was traveling with 3 other guests so 2 rooms were booked during our stay. The hotel and staff helped us by getting us 2 rooms adjacent to each other. With one being a suite and the rooms connected, it felt like a large 2 bedroom apartment and was extremely comfortable for the 4 of us.Our trip to Tokyo was relatively short so we wanted to try and cram as much into 3 days as possible. The concierge helped us with our selections of restaurants, entertainment, shopping, etc. B/c we were out most of the day, most of our time at the hotel was spent eating breakfast and sleeping. The breakfast there is fantastic. As a platinum member, you have a choice to eat at the starwood preferred lounge or at the restaurant on the main level. Although there was a bit of a mixup with the hotel not recognizing my status during our first breakfast (had to speak with like 3 different staff members), they cleared it up and we didn't have any issues the rest of our stay. As I mentioned previously, the rooms were excellent and getting the rest we needed each night, to prepare for the long days that followed, was a non issue b/c the beds were so comfortable. We were in Tokyo for only 3 days but we saw so much that I think we really got a good feel of what Tokyo had to offer.When I go back to Tokyo, I will definitely be staying at the Westin Tokyo","Cliffside Park, New Jersey","dk62</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cliffside Park, New Jersey</strong>",0,5.0

Room was hard to book as the internet engine was being funny. They did make restaurant reservations for us over email in advance however, and this was most useful.Was very nicely decorated with poilte, freindly, helpful staff and large rooms. Also had an excellent view from level 20. Found the hotel a bit expensive, however, as even in the club rooms internet was 900 yen (half price...) and they did not waive the (3000JPY) cover charge for guests for the band on the one night we wanted to visit the Compass Rose bar on the top floor. Not sure if there was a charge on other nights but the bar was nowhere near full. Just a little thing.They have a 1 Michelin Star Chinese restaurant and a few other bars and restaurants around the place. Didn't eat at any of them unfortunately, so i'm unsure what they were like. Chateau Joel Robuchon over the road was amazing, however.Breakfast was nice with a huge selection in the lobby restaurant. Would have been pricey if it wasn't included in the rate though, as it was 3800JPY pp from memory. Never had the club breakfast, and the nibbles at night time would not have been a sufficient replacement for dinner like they can be at some hotels. The selection also was very similar each night so got old very fast. A bit more variety would have been nice. The drinks are self pour with the standard selection of house spirits and some wines. Internet is free and wireless in the club. It was also very quiet during the week then packed on weekends for (I think) local weddings.Service at the club was good but we never asked them to do anything very taxing. The concierge was excellent, booking us restaurants and having the local map with subway directions written on sent to our rooms while we were out each day. Could not fault the staff, especially the concierges.The location is excellent. Yebisu Garden Place doesn't have the whole 'big city' feel to it that other areas may have, so you don't step out onto a roaring road surrounded by skyscrapers. The nearest and most convenient station is Ebisu and you can get there entirely undercover if needed, with moving walkway about half the distance, ~10 min walk. There's plenty of nearby restaurants for all budgets and tastes from convenience stores to 3 Michelin Star kitchens. Ebisu station is on the Yamanote line, the main circle around Tokyo, and also the Hibiya subway line which cuts southwest to north eastish.The surrounding area is rather pleasant to walk through too. All in all, absolutely loved the location and the service but would probably not go for a club room again as I couldn't justify the extra money for the benefits. Will definately be back to Tokyo and it's about 70-30 (in favour) as to whether we stay at the Westin again.","Perth, Australia","Cynicor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",38,4.0

The lounge turned out to be a much better choice. For dinner we went to the Australian fair buffet on the first floor. It seems like every month they have a featured country for the buffet and February of 2011 was Australian. We had a feast for considering how much we ate and the quality of the food was a very fair price. It was a nice hotel and I would recommend it to anyone. We paid about 25,000 yen. Footnote.

At that time, it was one of the better options in Tokyo and was well worth the premium versus other properties in the city.I stayed there again in November and very little has changed at the property in the last 10 years. The design of the lobby and rooms is the same. The service remains good and the overall experience is exceptional for a Westin. The rooms feel a bit more like a very traditional Ritz Carlton (i.e., your grandmother / grandfather’s vision of luxury – lace, marble, and a bit of a French boudoir feel). The lobby is over the top marble and baroque statuary. Not my style but good quality and a very popular place for wedding photos. A noticeable improvement in the last 10 years is the upgrade to the lobby restaurant and buffet – which is underrated and a nice find.The one thing that has changed in the last 10 years is that Tokyo now has far more luxury hotel options. A good rate at these properties (Mandarin, Peninsula, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton) isn’t that much more than the 30,000 JPY+ rate often charged at the Westin. Best things about the property:- high quality rooms and service, much better than the “typical” Westin- great location in Ebisu. Near Shibuya / Harajuku but a quieter area with great restaurant choices- large rooms (much larger than the Cerulean Tower which is a close competitor in terms of price point and location)- excellent in-house dining facilitiesOpportunities for improvement:- pricing level sometimes too close to the new 5-star luxury properties which makes the Westin a non-competitive choice- disappointing spa treatments.

The proximity to the subway is superb (after a 16 hour flight, we were happy to take the train/subway to Meguro and walk through the shopping mall to the Westin - easy to navigate even in super jetlagged state) and we loved walking to nearby Ebisu for dinner - lots of younger, casual and more local restaurants around that area.

It was the 1st November and I probably sound like Scrooge, but I was all a bit much.The location is good, a little out of the high rise craziness and on the Yamanote Line (a must for a tourist), but i found myself having to leave at least 45mins before each meeting downtown which takes a while to reach by taxi. I ordered room service on my first night, the French onion soup is good and the service was fast and friendly.For a big hotel I was frustrated by the need to dial reception to get online, the same old Westin toiletries grate on me a little and there was only one English tv channel. The hair dryer was one of this silly little travel versions (it baffles me that hotels provide travel hairdryers, if that was going to be helpful, I would invest in my own!)",London,"Hayley C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",1,3.0

The rooms are large compared with most hotels & ours was always spotlessly clean. The location is very good, with a couple of streets of cafes & bars just round the corner, a shopping centre over the road & the train station a short walk away.I highly recommend this hotel to business or leisure travellers.","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","UKKiwiHK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</strong>",16,5.0

This is a Catagory 6 hotel, so the expectation is very high and I was pleasantly surprised that the service is beyond excellent. I am a Starwood Platinum member and travel quite a bit for leisure, so I have other good properties to compare with, including St Regis Beijing and Shanghai. Though TripAdvisor, I found Mirei Ri at Westin and contact her prior to my arrival. I highly recommend that you connect with Mirei, as she is an invaluable resource and she will make your stay perfect. I can give you her email, if you send me a message.Pre-Arrival:I contacted Mirei, in hopes of getting an upgrade to a suite. Unfortunately, the hotel was booked, so was not able to get a suite, but I was able to get an excellent room with a great view of the city and Tokyo Tower on the Executive Club floor (17th floor). I also requested a special US DVD player and empty mini-bar, both requests were filled. Mirei also provided much info on transportation, shopping, local attractions, which was VERY helpful!Airport Transfer:The Airport Limousine bus counter is located just outside of Narita Terminal 1 baggage claim and I am sure they have one at Terminal 2 as well. The cost is 3,000 Y and go to stop 13 at the curb after you purchase your ticket. Takes 1 hour and goes to the front door at Westin, departs at 25 min past the hour. Orange and white bus...can't miss it. www.limousinebus.co.jpCheck In:For the Executive Club, you can go directly up to the 17th floor and there is a separate desk there to check you in. The check in was very welcoming, as I got to meet Mirei and the general manager of the hotel, Andreas Trauttmansdorff...That is really VIP treatment!Guest Room:Although it was not the suite that I hoped for, the room was very nice and I loved that it was located so close to the Executive Club Lounge. The view was awesome and the room had the standard Japanese DVD and the special US DVD player with small flat panel TV, also available are On Demand movies. There is also a DVD store right next door, if you want to rent and a movie theater across the street at Yebisu Garden Place, (no English movies when I was there).In the room is a desk, loveseat, Westin Heavenly Bed. The bathroom has separate tub and shower, robe, slippers and the best Bvlgari toiletries...heavenly! Two in room safes, including one for laptop with outlet for recharging. You will love the heated toilet seat. The mini-bar was emptied, so I could put soda and snacks inside and there was coffee maker (with coffee)+ hot water dispenser (with tea), 1 free bottle water per day. The air conditioning in the room was the BEST! It was unbearably hot in Tokyo in early Sept ( the room was my oasis at the end of the day). There were no suites available and other Platinum members I met, were also not able to get these larger rooms, probably because this property doesn't have that many. Mirei also had chocolate mints waiting for me in the room and I had requested more, they were so yummy! Mirei (with special help from the IT staff) got my iPhone connected to the Wifi in the room! Daily newspaper is provided. Platinum members get the room internet with no charge, otherwise, I think there is a small fee.I also got extra hangers (always need those) and electrical adapter. Executive Club Floor:Breakfast is included with the Executive Club floor rooms and for Platinum guests. The choice is the buffet breakfast at The Terrace Restaurant on the first floor (normally 3600 Y) and you will be tempted by the large selection, including pastries, toast, bagel, fresh squezzed orange and grapefruit juice, fruit, yogurt, cereal, eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes, salad, pasta, fish, japanese breakfast ( pickled vegetables, miso, rice) and much more. The restaurant is very crowded on the weekends. The other option is the relaxing breakfast in the Exec Club Lounge with all the basic options. Room service is also available and the Continental Breakfast is about 3000 Y.During the day, the Executive lounge features beverages and pastries and Happy Hour from 5:30 - 7:30 pm with drinks, snacks and yummy hor d'oeurves. Also, it is a gathering space and I met other guests. Restaurants:There are many restaurant options at the hotel, although I did not eat at any of them, including on the 22nd floor Victors (Continental), Yebisu (Teppanyahi), Compass Rose (lounge) 2nd floor Ryutenmon (Chinese), Mai (Japanese), 1st floor, The Bar, Lounge and Terrace. Across the street at Yebisu Garden Place, they have many restaurants, and on the top floor of the office building and in the ground floor of the Mitsukoshi department store, there is a fantastic food hall and gourmet grocery store (not to be missed). At the Ebisu subway station, there are so many budget, but gourmet food options.Transportation and Location:I found that the hotel location was ideal, it was a short walk (even in the heat) to the Ebisu subway station, where you could get anywhere in Tokyo. The Skywalk is just past the Yebisu Garden Place (across the street from Westin, which features the famous Joel Robuchon restaurant). Taxis are readily available at the hotel also (800 Y just to hop in).The metro station is a little confusing, as there are 2 metro lines running (JR Yamanote Line and Hibiya Subway). It is a major hub, so it is very easy to get to your destination from here. You can get( for a 500 Y deposit) a reloadable Pasmo subway card that will remain in your wallet and you just wave it over the turnstile and also can be used at convenience stores and restaurants. Hotel Amenities:The free Westin WORKOUT is located on the 4th floor next to the Le Spa Parisien. You can use the spa facilities with a Day Pass with I think is about 3500 Y. The Swedish 60 min massage is 16,800 Y and in room massage is also available with a 20% discount during certain hours. There is also Westin Kids Club and Business Center. I believe they have arrangements for nearby pool use, if you desire. There is no ATM, but one located at the metro station or in the office bldg at Yebisu.Tokyo:I had booked a one day sightseeing tour on the web via Viator, prior to arrival and Mirei helped me confirm the pick up at the hotel. The bus tour included the main sights of Tokyo, Meiji Shinto Shrine, Imperial Palace Garden (tons of mosquitos here), Asakusa temple, lunch, bay cruise near Rainbow Bridge and waterfront Aqua City shopping mall. Book online ahead of time and it is less than when you book with hotel concierge. Mirei also helped me with information on the Tsukiji Fish Market, which I recommend. You dont have to go to the Fish Auction at 4:30 am and the fish market is a fun, unique experience and there are many casual places to grab fresh sushi. The best shopping experience is at the new Marunouchi district. You casually stroll the tree and art lined street Nakadori with the high end stores, like Hermes. At one end of the street is the gorgeous Peninsula Hotel and the other is, the not to be missed Shin-Marunouchi Building (several floors also filled shops and restaurants). The Tokyo National Museum in Ueno Park is nice and there are other museums here to visit. My local friend took me to Roppongi area for dinner at Gonpachi, which is a lively place with locals and visitors alike. They have many Japanese ""tapas style small dishes"" here to share and very affordable!Definitely would highly recommend the Westin Tokyo and recommend the Executive Club Floor rooms, which offer numerous amenities. The outstanding service can't be beat and anything you need will be taken care of. It was so nice of Mirei to see me off in my taxi and made me sad to say goodbye! I also received very nice emails from both Mirei and the general manager after my departure!Please enjoy my Tokyo Picasa Web Album:http://picasaweb.google.com/SusieJue/Tokyo#","San Ramon, California","SusieJue</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Ramon, California</strong>",312,5.0

This one rates at the top. We were dusty and carrying only back packs, having shipped our luggage ahead to the Westin some days previously (great system by the way). The staff did not miss a beat despite our appearance - throughout our stay all hotel staff were super polite, helpful and accommodating. We upgraded to club and enjoyed a fabulous room with fine inlaid wood furnishings, an exquisite bath, lots of toiletries, nice yakutas and slippers ect, great linens and a view that at night felt like an infinity pool of lights: there were floor to ceiling windows looking toward the downtown of Tokyo. The club floor offered nice happy hour snacks and drinks plus a very good breakfast of mixed Japanese and westerns treats. The buffet was equally available to us (included with room) on the main floor. It was vast! Don't go there on Sunday though unless you book ahead - it is a fancy and popular place for family brunch. The hotel offers access to a fitness center in the mall which can be reached from the lower level of the hotel so you don't need to go outside.The hotel is located in a quieter area of Tokyo which frankly is rather a relief from much of the city density. Still, it is well served with indoor/outdoor shopping center attached, great restaurants around and a skywalk moving sidewalk to the Ebisu Subway Station. The station is on a the main JR line that circles Tokyo, so it is easy to get to - look for the East Gate sign when you get off the train. As you approach that exit you will see the skywalk. Looking straight ahead, you can see the Westin sign as you reach the very end of the skywalk: hotel is situated on the far side of the mall. We did discover that you can walk inside through the mall if it is raining. Stay to the right when leaving the skywalk and head down a level. Then you can walk through to the far side of the mall and via a sort of tunnel at the end, straight into the lower level of the hotel. The hotel web is quiet poor for directions unless you are driving - but we found it easily enough at the end. Importantly, we discovered that the tall office towers on one side of that pretty shopping mall had two full floors at the top for restaurants. Some had almost theatre style seating that allowed a superb view for everyone. There must have been 20 +restaurants up there - all different. and ranging from pub style to very expensive. You take the elevators inside the tower lobby","Ottawa, Canada","adventurelady99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",36,5.0

We have stayed at several starwood properties around the world, but our experience at the Westin Tokyo was absolutely one of our favorites. Knowing that we had an upcoming wedding, Mirei Ri along with the staff greeted us with champagne and a congratulatory note along with a helpful packet of information about the city and hotel. As a platinum member, we were upgraded to an executive floor room and then a suite. Both rooms were wonderful. While we agree with other reviews that the decor is more reminiscent of the Sheraton brand, this in no way compromises the overall feel of a very clean, modern, luxurious, inviting and calming space. The Westin amenities and touches were still prevalent and of course the heavenly bed was very plush and comfortable. All of the facilities including the gym, executive lounge, breakfast buffet at the Terrace restaurant and at Mai were outstanding. All of the staff were extremely patient and helpful and answered any questions we had. Additionally, several staff members remembered our names and greeted us throughout the hotel. For example, after seeing us wait at Mai for breakfast, one staff ran into us later on that day and asked us how our breakfast was. It was details like this that truly separated this hotel with other ones. The location of the hotel along with the surrounding area would perfect for any type of trip--- family vacation, business, romantic getaway, etc. The Yebisu Garden Place across the street offers great restaurants, shopping and even a beer museum! Atre at the Ebisu JR station is also a great place to buy nicely packaged souvenirs and gifts. Otherwise, you can get to any of the popular Tokyo areas (Shibuya, Harajuku Shinjuku, Ueno, Tokyo, Asakusa, Ginza, Tsukiji, etc.) within a short train ride. I travel frequently for work and have stayed at many hotels in Asia and around the world for extended periods.

You also had to pay to use the spa heat facilities which in other hotels are free of charge to hotel guests. Treatments are quite pricy but thats the going rate in all Tokyo hotels.

First off Mirei Ri personally helped plan our stay and answered our transporation questions from Narita to the Westin. The limousine bus Mirei Ri recommended stops right outside the hotel and takes about 1h 45minutes from Narita terminal 2.Once inside the hotel you are treated to a very elegant lobby and a friendly and professional check in. We were escorted to our room by Ms. Tomita who was friendly and answered all our questions. The beautiful room we had faced east and had an incredible view of the Tokyo tower and the Roppongi area. The room was immaculately clean and comfortable. The impeccable bathroom had a large walk in shower as well as a tub. The bed was heavenly as promised, and the room had blackout curtains for sleeping in darkness.If you stay at the Westin we highly recommend the Executive Lounge on the 17th floor. The views are incredible and you have a long list of benefits including: free wireless, happy hour drinks, breakfast in the morning and the room is tended to at all times should you have any questions. Another incredible feature of the Westin is the personal attention you receive. We needed a map printed to get to a location at 4am to visit the fish market, and Mr. Jun Shigeta (Westin Host) not only printed out the map for us, but also hand delivered it to us while we were in the lounge. Furthermore the staff are very knowledgeable about the local area and speak excellent English.The Westin is located in Ebisu right near the Garden Place which has loads of shops and the Mitsukoshi department store. If you are a fan of gourmet food make sure to go to the Mitsukoshi food garden area in the bottom floor. It is incredible. The Ebisu train station is about 800 meters from the door of the Westin to the entrance of the station. There is a moving walkway most of the way to the station so at most you walk about 100 meters. From the Ebisu station you are one stop to Shibuya, 2 stops to Harajuku, and 2 stops to Roppongi. The location is great.If you are headed to Tokyo this is the place to stay.

The bathroom was all a bit dated with none of the new/modern fixtures you would expect in this standard of hotel.The Club lounge was completely full but at least we got in - on our last stay there wasn't room !!

The Yebisu Garden Place is right next door and provides easy access to restaurants, small shops, and a department store. Around the JR / subway stations are some smaller side streets that had some great local restaurants (Ippudo ramen is walkable and highly recommended).We booked two rooms on the executive floor - the rooms were veryspacious and had great views of Ebisu. The Heavenly beds were quitegood and comfortable as usual.One of the perks of the executive floor is the lounge and this loungewas one of the better lounges in Japan - if not the best.

The food servedduring cocktail hour was tasty and varied from day to day. The loungewas normally very quiet and provided a welcome place to relax afterspending busy days in Tokyo.We regularly ate the buffet breakfast in the Terrace restaurant. Great selection of food - traditional Japanese dishes, Western selections, and French pastries. Everything tasted good and very fresh. We all really enjoyed the croissants and Japanese poached eggs are so rich and creamy. The staff went out of their way to ensure our stay was enjoyable. Helpful maps and local guide books were placed in the room before we arrived.

First, as someone else mentioned, this is not your typical Westin. I m not too sure to which group this property belonged before becoming the Westin, but the interior is very glitzy with dark red marble, goldish decorations and everything that made a top hotel back in the eighties. So far all the Westins I stayed were more on the modern, contemporary side so it was kind of a shock. But despite the interior being very eighties, it is still quite well maintained, and everything is still clean and fine. We had a corner room so space was ample which is very rare in the capital city. Again, the interior of the rooms were fine and clean but just felt like coming from another age, like some great old Sheraton decades ago. Anyway as for location, well, again, it will depend on your liking. It sure is in a very quiet place, which is again very rare in Tokyo, with its pros and cons. Pros: well after a long day, it s nice to be in a quiet and relaxed atmosphere away from the constant bustling of the city. Cons: well if you are looking for some entertainment, or even restaurants you have no choice but to either take the train or the cab to Shibuya or Shinjuku. There is really nothing within walking distance and the little mall attached to the train station is kind of lame with nothing much inside. As for service, again, I noticed that it was very different depending on the staff, which is very unlike Japan where service is usually very good in the whole hotel. As for us, we found the service at the reception to be very cold. It was professionnal and fast but we didnt feel welcomed at all. Not a smile, not a welcome, straight to business. That s in stark constrast with the motto of the Westin and everything written on their fancy brochures and sites. But some other staff were more friendly, greeting us with a smile every time, and looking eager to help or assist us. Overall we ended with mixed feelings. While it was nice to be away from the noise, it was troublesome not to have any restaurants within the area. Again, rooms were spacious and clean but the design really felt outdated. Last, while the staff at the front desk was very cold, others were very friendly and nice to talk to.

I have stayed in alot of hotels for business and this gym was twice as large as say the W's in Times Square New York.- I am an SPG member and they have a dedicated checking desk, and floor, and lounge. Lounge had great views and it was nice to sit there and enjoy their drinks while working out the plan for the evening.- breakfast was included and this was a good selection of Japanese and western food, which was all good qualityLOCATION- ok, this may divide some people, as it is in Ebisu and about a 4-5minute walk to the subway/train:I liked this alot; it was quieter, only 1 stop to Harajuku, a couple more to Shibuya (think Times Square) and walking from the hotel to the station, you go through a very nice shopping centre which restaurants, shops and a big supermarket (get your water and sake from here, while eating some of the free samples they thrust at you). It is quiet and easy to get to. If you compare to say Hyatt where I went, a freeway runs near it, and a couple of 7 Eleven type stores nearby, and then that's it!DOWNSIDE: if you want to use the Airport Limosuine Bus, it is not very frequent. We arrived nad had to wait an hour for the next bus, which visited Westin as the final stop....two hours later! Bit of a downer having travelled on an 11 hour flight from London. I would single out the concierge team as really going way out to help you, providing maps, checking subway and train times etc. They were simply fantastic, comparable to the rest of the staff who keep this hotel running so well and so efficiently. I would stay here again when I return to Tokyo.","London, United Kingdom","santosdiego</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",123,5.0

We reserved two executive rooms that were located on the 19th floor and we had access to the club room (extremely helpful and pleasant staff always present) on the 17th floor. The hotel can be highly recommended. Having lived earlier in Tokyo near Shibuya we decided to find a hotel conveniently close and Westin fit the bill perfectly. The location is very good even though the trip to and from Ebisu station started to get a bit tiring after a few days. Getting around on the JR and metro is, however, a breeze from Ebisu.Our rooms were very spacious with very nice views of Tokyo Tower. Rooms were maintained very nicely with tea/coffee and water available in the room. Breakfast could be taken either in the club lounge or just off the lobby. The buffet here was much more extensive than the lounge. We did not otherwise eat at the hotel and prices seemed very high. The cocktail hour was very pleasant with nice snacks offered each day.I can strongly recommend this hotel. The location is very good and being only a few minutes from Shibuya was well appreciated by our sons who loved the area. Also the Ebisu neighbourhood is very interesting with some excellent and reasonably priced restaurants.We used the Airport Limousine Bus to/from Narita direct to the hotel and it was very convenient.","Helsinki, Finland","T01Bhelsinki</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Helsinki, Finland</strong>",21,5.0

Ebisu is a nice walk away from Harajuku and Shibuya or a 3 minute ride on the train. Our housekeepers were amazing!!! I'm a very messy person when I travel and they went beyond the call of their duty by even arranging my mess to orderly situatied on the table or counter or where ever it was. Front desk and managers were quite helpful. We had sooooo much bags from all the shopping that we did and the bell men were very helpful with holding our bags and keeping them in order to ensure a speedy departure. We even got to meet one of the top executives of the hotel and he was so warm and welcoming to us as guest and even became friends with us. No swimming pool or spa and we had to pay daily for internet, but it's Japan. The concierge directed us to a great spa and we purchased 500 yen cards for the few minutes of internet we needed.

The wonderful thing about this hotel is the location. Ebisu is a wonderful European style village with lots of greats shops, bars and restaurants.

The location is very difficult to get to, and requires several train/subway changes regardless of where in Tokyo you are coming from. The rooms are okay sized for Japan's typical ketchy/stingy accommodations, but hugely overpriced. Although the economy is always bad in Japan, and thus, customers should be 'king', the Westin (as most Japan hotels do) make the customers feel that we should be grateful for them allowing us into their restaurant. We have observed the constant increase in prices, particularly for the Dinner Buffets in last 2-years, and the constant downward slide in Customer Service. The Westin charges an outrageously (and foolishly) high $80/meal for Buffet-type food that is only slightly above average taste. Most other Hotel Buffets in Tokyo are only charging $35-$55/meal. They charge high prices for by-the-glass wine, and then underpour tiny amounts to conserve their profits. Although Terrace Restaurant has warm-bread service at the tables, they do not announce it to any of the customers, and instead just wait for the customers to complain about no bread before they consider to bring it to table or not. The Wait-Staff are rude and must be hunted-down every time we needed plates cleared or water filled. At the door to restaurant it is nearly impossible to get 'walk-up' entry into restaurant (they set-aside vast majority for reservations that never show up) and attempt to force timed-service on everyone with their restrictive seating times. They then coerce you to leave if you have extended beyond what they consider your time-slot. This makes the customer feel that they are just feeding cattle on a schedule instead of serving their customers. They usually coerce phone-in customers to delay schedule for after 8:30pm (when no reasonable person is still dining), and then if you do agree to eat that late...one finds many of the buffet items empty-plates (we had to scold the cooks for standing around without filling them). Ever since they rennovated the Terrace Restaurant (a look that turned out worse than before), the prices have sky-rocketed as they try to price-gouge the customers to recover the building expenses. Although Weston's lobby is visually one of the prettiest in Tokyo, Foreign Travellers should avoid this Westin Hotel if they want anything like Value-4-Money. Customers leave this hotel feeling cheated and abused. The rooms are too small for price charged, and they attempt to charge you for everything added (e.g. they even make you pay for tea/coffee in the rooms, and charge by-the-person so one must pay twice the cost for husband/wife staying). This is indicative of all Japanese Hotels, and is one of the clear reasons that international travelers only come to Japan when forced to (e.g. business trip).","Herndon, Virginia","ME98</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Herndon, Virginia</strong>",125,2.0

Not a typical Westin, has far more black marble, gold, and wood paneling than usual. Lobby is large and airy, has a very nice sunken lounge area, a restaurant, gift shop, and business lounge. Biz center computer usage is approx $10 for 45 mins. Only had a quick breakfast in The Terrace, the lobby restaurant, which was fine, and except for the coffee (approx $8), fairly priced. Had roomservice once for dinner which came quick and was delicious. Think the pricing was on the higher side but not too absurd.Guestrooms are large and afford nice views of surrounding Ebisu. Bathrooms are huge as well, very luxurious and come with a huge amount of amenities, toothbrush, toothpaste, shaver, shaving cream, in addition to the standard shampoo, body wash, etc... Heavenly bed was solid, but not exceptional.A bottled water was provided free each day, which was a nice touch.Hotel is located in Ebisu Garden Place. a mixed-use complex with shops, restaurants, apartments and office buildings that wouldn't look out of place in Dallas. Regardless, it's a very upscale neighborhood of Tokyo and is proximate to Ebisu station which is serviced by the JR Yamanote line and the Tokyo metro (subway). Station is about a 10-12 min walk from the hotel, partly through an a long enclosed skywalk. Location for visiting Tokyo is very good, but you'll need to take the JR or the subway just a few stops to avoid very long walks. We used the concierge a few times and other than just once giving us horrible directions to a nearby restaurant, was otherwise uniformly fantastic. All the service staff in the hotel were fantastic.

He booked it before he came to Japan because he belongs to the Starwoods Hotel group and gets executive club privileges. That really did not seem to matter at the Westin Tokyo. He was treated poorly by the staff at the desk on our 2nd day there. They were really rude and after 5 days there, it seemed like a pattern for certain staff members. They were nice to me when I spoke Japanese but not so nice when having to speak in English to tourists. My friend is a friendly person and talked to many people in many places so it was not like he was a rude guy asking for bad service. The concierge people were not that great either. The room was fine, nothing special. The bathroom was very nice and clean. The first floor restaurant was not good at all unless you like all-you-can-eat restaurants with so-so food. That was a surprise to see in a supposedly 5-star hotel. The location is pretty bad too. It is a long walk to get to the trains/subways. Or you can take a long taxi ride to get to where the action is. EBISU is a BORING area to stay in. If you want to be isolated from the best spots then stay here. I have stayed in better hotels in Tokyo and I have been in better ones where other guests from home have stayed. It was not a great experience at this Westin Hotel. I am a huge fan of the Westin in Kyoto and always make my friends and family stay there so it was disappointing to have such a bad time at the one in Tokyo.

Check in went off without a hitch and all the hotel facilities were explained to us by the friendly concierge members, all who speak excellent english. The room was spacious and modern, which came as a relief coming off a less than impressive stay at a different starwood hotel. The bed (heavenly bed) was all it was made out to be, the TV had a few more english channels than usual and the room was appointed with a lounge and desk. Arranging restaurant reservations and clearing up a few itinerary-related things as well as routes to different destinations was made easy by the concierge. There are also a few helpful booklets around the hotel with suggested itineraries, useful maps etc. We were a little disappointed by the fact that the gym, pool and internet facilties were not available to guests without an extra fee since other less expensive hotels had these provided for free (especially internet). I can understand that since the pool is off property (and belongs to an Ebisu lifestyle/fitness club) that it is unrealistic to provide it to guests for free; however, over $10 per usage of the gym and exorbitant charges for internet at a hotel that I imagine caters to many business people is pretty poor. Internet in the business centre is 1000y/45min, laptop rental is around 2000y/day + fees for using the wifi in your room.During our stay we had breakfast at the Terrace most days, which offers a la carte, and continental or full buffet meals (at around ~1800/3600 yen each respectively) - it was a bit more than we were used to paying but the buffet was pretty extensive so it was worth a try - it's also worth mentioning we found the service was top notch each day. We had dinner in two of the other restaurants on offer - Victor's, the french restaurant, and Ryutenmon, the chinese restaurant - and ordered set meals at each which came at around 13k-14k yen per person (starting at around 10k). Victor's was a little disappointing in terms of value for money and we felt that the portion sizes and quality of the dishes were worth about half of what we paid. However, we were quite happy to pay what we did at Ryutenmon and the set course was truly memorable - highlights including the pork belly, crab and shark fin soup and Japanese beef. I think the fact that this place was packed on an ordinary Thursday night speaks for itself. The area is fantastic, with the large Ebisu garden/shopping area just across the street as well as Joel Robouchon's Tokyo restaurant, if you're a fan. Ebisu itself is somewhere in the middle of everything, and the JR station is only a few stops from Shibuya, Shinjuku and Harajuku. At the end of the day it's great to retire to a quieter part of town and get away from it all.

I won't dwell on those because The Westin Tokyo lives up to or surpasses every single one of those assumptions.The location of the hotel is fantastic - about a 10 minute walk from Ebisu Station via a lovely walk through Ebisu Garden Place (where the Sapporo factory is). There is a Starbucks, McDonalds (if you're into that kind of thing) and wine market two minutes from the hotel, very convenient.The concierge service was outstanding and went above and beyond our expectations in terms of making bookings for us, answering questions, clearly mapping out locations for us and making sure our cab driver was 110% clear on where we needed to go. None of the cab drivers speak English, so this was very important, although you can almost avoid them completely by utilizing the fantastic subway/metro and nearby Ebisu Station.We stayed over Christmas and paid approx. $250 USD/night which is admittedly a bit steep but not for Tokyo, the most expensive city in the world. In my mind, having a reliable concierge service to help you get where you need to go in a country where no one speaks your language is worth the extra dough. Plus, on the rare occasion we would take a taxi, all of the drivers knew exactly where ""Westin"" was right away without any confusion or awkward moments.The only downside I can think of is the $18 USD/day charge for use of internet in the room. Not sure if there is a similar charge to use the business center, might be worth looking into because the $18 was kind of a slap in the face when you're already paying a decently high rate to stay there.","San Francisco, California","McBunny</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",8,4.0

This hotel is located across from Ebisu Garden Place and Tokyo photography museum, which deserves to be tourist attractions in their own right. In order to take subway (taxi is quite expensive in Tokyo), you will have to cross this giant mall featuring mid to upscale stores. You can use Ebisu station where both JR and Tokyo Metro lines are. Shibuya, Harajuku and other major Tokyo attraction is a few stations away. I was at first concerned this location is a bit off from the different centers of the city where all the actions take place, but in retrospect, I am sure I made a good decision to stay here because it is a very quite and safe area to stay in without hustle bustle of the city. There is a Joel Robuchon bakery and restaurant right across from the hotel, which is another reason why I loved to stay in Westin. The Ebisu Garden Place mall also features glass tower and Mitsukoshi deparment store. This convenient location came in handy on our last day, when there isn't enough time to go to downtown. So, my suggestion is to save the mall for the partial day when you arrive or leave. Another important thing to mention in terms of location is Airport Limousine to and from Narita Airport. Since we had huge suitcases, this was really convenient feature. You can just hop on and you are at the airport. FYI, the fare was 3000 yen per person. The room was very clean and professionally kept. The room was spacious (unusual for Tokyo), and in addition to quite spacious bathroom sink where you could perform your beauty regimen, there is a vanity where you could sit and do your thing.

There are two problems which the Westin needs to address:1) Poor front desk service / communication ability2) Inability of guests staying at the hotel (and paying a rather significant price for their rooms) to get a reservation at in-house restaurants.After numerous encounters, our experience was that the front desk staff generally lacked the ability to communicate in English. It was frustrating for my non-Japanese speaking parents to not be able to be understood and have their needs met, especially after having spent time in this Westin and many other Starwood properties over the years. They got the impression that the front desk staff were not interested in them or their needs - their focus seemed to be on efficiency over quality. Perhaps the biggest issue they faced was the inability to get a table at the hotel restaurants. The Westin is a popular destination for diners in Tokyo, and the restaurants are generally fully booked in the evenings. For an elderly couple who cannot easily go elsewhere, this was extremely frustrating. Why the Westin does not reserve several tables for hotel guests is no mystery - they want to fill up their tables on a first-come first-served basis - but is inconvenient for people staying there who don't want to (or can't) go elsewhere.We did manage to visit most of the restaurants despite the above problem; unfortunately the experience was not always up to our expectations:- The Lounge: The only restaurant with an open table at the time; food was terrible- Ryutenmon: overall excellent service, food and ambience. Very difficult to get a reservation here.- Mai: Great service, food was very good- The Terrace: crowded, ok service (some servers cannot communicate in English), made several mistakes on our bill. However, food is good and served quickly- Victor's: The only restaurant with an open table at the time; overpriced, food was disappointing (the night my parents went, the menu was limited to ""Hungarian, Bohemian, Austrian Esterhazy"" items such as sausages, cabbage and wiener schnitzel, which was certainly not what they expected or wanted). However, it offers a spectacular view of Tokyo to distract you from the mediocrity of the cuisine.On the positive side:Room was fine - spacious, clean, and with good amenities.Concierge was friendly and helpfulPorters were helpful and frequently asked if we needed anythingTo summarize, this Westin property does not offer the level of service which one might expect of a property with the kind of reputation it enjoys.

The lobby was very nicely decorated with Christmas decorations. The room was spacious as was the bathroom and I have to say extremely clean and I am very particular in regards to cleanliness so the hotel must have an excellent housekeeper. When I looked at the hotel website prior to arrival it mentioned ""Heavenly Beds"" so I assumed they would be rather like the wonderful beds that you get in Shangri La's or Four Seasons, alas they were not and looked as though they were quite a few years old and in need of replacement. The furnishings in the room were well maintained but old and very dated. I was most disappointed at arriving back late after dinner to find that there had not been a turn down service. When I called Reception about this I was told that I should have requested it. Again on the hotel website it mentions turn down service. At rack rate I would have expected it to be automatic.I called down a couple of times to ask for fresh milk for my early morning tea as I don't like the dried milk in the room and the first response was yes but you have to pay for it, not certainly let me arrange that for you.I found it quite irratating that when I went for coffee or afternoon tea in the lounge that all the window seats had been reserved so I was not able to sit in them, I would have had my coffee or afternoon tea and left yet still the window seats were vacant.It was very much pot luck as to what the service was like in the restuarant.

Our room was pretty-well sized and was comparable in size to the standard Westin. However, by Tokyo standards, our standard room was huge. Lots of room to move around--plenty of closet and drawer space. It came with a desk and chair, a lounging chair and a sitting table with a mirror. The bathroom was pretty well-sized too, except the shower did make me feel a little claustrophobic as the all-glass enclosure was a bit cramped. Bathroom also has a high-tech toilet/bidet, too.We had two twin beds. Warning: the twin beds are not Heavenly beds. They were still pillow-top mattresses and were still comfortable though.Service was top-notch. The man at check-in was not overtly warm, but that seems typical of Tokyo. Very professional and efficient. Concierge was very helpful with recommendations, but beware of the cultural differences between the West and Japan. It seemed the Japanese never wanted to contradict you--so, if you asked the concierge if XYZ was a good restaurant, you would receive a response that XYZ was a satisfactory restaurant. However, probing further would elicit more detailed answers and probably a better recommendation for a restaurant. Our price, including tax, was about $300 a night. For what we got, and the quality of the hotel, we were not displeased. Our rate also included free in-room Internet, too. Don't get coffee at the hotel restaurant--it was $5 for a plain cup of coffee. Instead, walk to Starbuck's across the street in Yebisu Palace Gardens. A couple of minor nit-picks about the Westin Tokyo though. First, this hotel is over-the-top decorated in European-style flair. There is black and red marble everywhere, from the floors to the stairs to the molding around the elevators. That struck me as kind of odd for Tokyo. I felt like I was in a hotel in Paris. I guess I expected a more traditional Japanese design. Second, the Westin Tokyo is a tad bit far from mass transit options. Getting to the Metro station involved a hike across a street, through Yebisu Palace Gardens (a mall with Mitsukoshi Department Store, Starbucks and McDonalds!), across another street, through a rather-humid-and-hot window-lined corridor on 5 or 6 long moving walkways, through the Arte mall, and down a long escalator. The first day--no problem. By the third day, we started dreading the long hike. All in all, it takes about 10 minutes. But, once you get to the Metro, the Ebisu station is relatively convenient to get you to all the top attractions in Tokyo with one or two connections.A couple of tips we picked up for Tokyo. First, when you land at Narita, go downstairs to the basement of your terminal and look for the Travel Service Center. Buy a Narita Express/Suica card. This gets you a one-way Narita Express ticket into Tokyo along with a Suica card (which is used for Metro and JR Railways). It was about $32. It's a much better deal than just buying a Narita Express ticket (about $35 alone) and then buying Metro passes in Tokyo. Plus, the Suica card (which comes with about $15 in prepaid Metro tickets) lets you touch the card to the Metro fare gets and you pass right through.Second, when you go to Tsukiji Fish Market (everyone goes there to see the fish and eat sushi!), everyone says to go to Sushi Dai or Sushi Daiwa. Both are located in Building 6. When we were there this past weekend, each had a 3-hour wait. With our limited time, we did not have 3 hours to spare to wait for sushi. There's another little non-descript, hole-in-the-wall place in the next building over. It's called Ben-Tomi Sushi. Third restaurant from the end. The only way you'll see it is by looking at the ground for a red-colored mat with Ben-Tomi Sushi written on it. Here's the rub--it serves the same fresh, amazing sushi everyone else serves. But, it's a lot more expensive. We each had about 7 pieces of sushi (tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellowtail, scallop). It was $65 in total. If you're short on time, want great sushi, and are willing to pay more, head over to Ben-Tomi Sushi.","Aliso Viejo, California","McMax</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aliso Viejo, California</strong>",127,4.0

The decor was not to our taste but by Japanese standards, it can be considered luxury. There is a fantastic restaurant close to the hotel, famous for it's pork katsu. I think concierge will know the name. The walk to Ebisu station is still about 10mins (not as close as I was expecting) so allow for extra time but the metro/train was very easy to use. We highly, highly recommend taking a private tour of the fish markets (at 4am) - run by a local guy who used to work at the markets with impeccable English (you can google tsukiji nakamura and it will bring up his website). He also takes you to an incredible sushi place at the markets for breakfast, after the tour, if you want. Again, highly recommended. The hotel is also conveniently located very close to the 3 star Michelin Robouchon restaurant (which was handy for our very long lazy lunch). If you want a hotel with an active nightlife, then this is not the place. For a more tranquil, peaceful stay, then book the Westin.","Singapore, Singapore","Glamanda</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",99,4.0

Although our son speaks Japanese, we don't, so we wanted to stay at a hotel where the language wouldn't be a problem and the Westin was a perfect choice.We took the Airport Limousine Bus from Narita to the hotel-- very convenient! The ticket counter is located directly across from you as you exit customs, so even if you are exhausted (we were!) and don't speak Japanese, you can find it easily. Cost is approximately $30 per person and the ride is about an hour and a half. Make sure you purchase your return tickets in advance at the hotel-- they'll even let you add it to your hotel bill. :-)You can access the JR Ebisu train station on the Yamanote line by connecting corridors from the Westin (level B1) through the Yebisu Garden Place (upscale mall/business towers). Signs are clearly posted and there are moving walkways to speed you through. You can also access the Hibiya line of the metro/subway-- again, follow the signs.Our room was lovely-- quite large. King-size bed, ladies vanity, business desk, dresser with flat screen tv and dvd player, sitting area (small loveseat, coffee table, and an armchair), and a bar area including coffee and tea service. A nice touch was the complimentary bottled water-- some hotels charge $5 for a bottle of water. Geez!The hotel staff did an excellent job: the maid service was perfect, the front desk was efficient, and the concierge was very helpful-- particularly in recommending places for dinner. Our favorite was Bikkuri for sushi (we ate there three times!). The sushi was fabulous, and the prices were extremely reasonable. It's also located very near the Ebisu train station, just a quick walk from the hotel.All in all, we had a wonderful experience at the Westin and I highly recommend it.","Veinticinco de Mayo, Argentina","JuliaR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Veinticinco de Mayo, Argentina</strong>",9,5.0

They gave us great directions, phoned in restaurant reservations for us, etc. Whenever in doubt, that concierge desk always was there to help. We paid an extra $30 US a night to be on concierge level, but it was so worth it because we got free internet, free cocktail hour every night and free breakfast buffet every morning (you could choose to eat in Executive club or in lobby restaurant). We ate in pretty lobby restaurant where by 2nd day, they remembered I was decaf and my husband liked regular coffee. When you would leave in the morning and come back tired at night, every and I mean every employee would smile and say hello. This was very warm and comforting to me being so far away from home. The location was awesome, just one train stop from Shibuya and two stops from Shinjinku. I liked that we were close to the action, but that our hotel was in a very quiet area.

We stayed at the Westin Tokyo hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Being frequent travellers and SPG members, we have seen our fair share of Westins and this one is beautiful. The lobby is lovely, the staff fantastic. The rooms were well appointed, we were upgraded to a ""view room,"" and while still very nice, you could see that in a few more years the bathrooms will need to be redone. The style is Japanese ornate, not Japenese chic. We had access to the club lounge which was one of the best we have seen and would highly recommend upgrading to it. Full hot american and japanese breakfast, and appetizers and drinks throughout the day and evening. The hotel had many restaurants, one which is 1 Michlen star rated and quite delicious.The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. We used the conceirge everyday and ended up with some great restaurant, museum, and sightseeing recommendations.The area around the hotel is very nice, however it is about a 10 minute walk to the JR line and 15 to the Tokyo Subway. The walk is not too bad as you use the people movers most of the time, however doing it a few times a day can get quick tiring especially after sightseeing. On the flip side, it is nice to come back to a ""quiet"" area after being in the hustle and bustle all day.The local restaurants around the hotel were amazing. Great sushi, soba noodles, and ramen. The only negative would be the cost of drinks in the bar, they are very expensive, over 2100 Yen for a glass of wine...

It is free and you can buy a beer sampler at the end.The TV in the hotel included five channels that were at least partially broadcast in English. Watching the Japanese channels was fun also. The hotel also had English newspapers available each day. They were only a few pages and covered the headlines.You can easily walk to the Ebisu rail/subway station from the hotel. The entire walk is covered and most of the journey includes moving sidewalks. From the airport I would recommend taking the Airport Limosine, which is Orange large nice clean city-style bus. The cost was about $30, which is about the same as the subway. The easy part about the limosine is they put the luggage underneath.My only complaint has to do with tax and tips. In Japan tax and tips is included in the price of everything. However, this does not apply at the Westin Tokyo. When we checked out they added a 10% gratuity service charge and some taxes. This added another $40 a night to our $245 room charge. We also skipped using the internet since the hotel was going to add a hefty daily charge for its use.

While the design of the hotel is not my preferred style, it kind of grew on me over the days. A few general comments are that the hotel is very well maintained. Location: I actually prefer this location. While there is a short walk to the metro and the JR Rail, it is all covered and you can use a moving walkway. The area around the hotel is a very calm and upscale residential area which was a very nice way to end the day. Yet it is still convenient to travel around. May be different if you are in Tokyo for business.Rooms: Are large by Tokyo standards. We had a standard corner room on the executive club floor. King heavenly bed, which is very firm by NA standards. Excellent bathroom, reasonable layout. Very efficient housekeeping. Only thing I noticed is that the carpet appears to be a bit older in the rooms. The condition of the hotel is such that I could not really tell if the hotel was recently renovated or was just very well maintained.Service: The level of service was excellent throughout. For part of our stay over the weekend, the hotel was completely full, but the level of service was still great.Food: Can only comment on the breakfast at the terrace restaurant. It was very high quality and varied. The croissants were some of the best ever. We did consider dinner at the japanese restaurant one day, but never made it back to the hotel in time (and the prices were high, even by Tokyo standards).Club Lounge: Decent sized room but given the number of executive club floors, i could see that the lounge could get very busy during the mornings. While I did not have breakfast at the club lounge, the quality of food offering was very good. Free wifi at the lounge.Fitness Centre: Small but well equipped gym. All the cardio equipment is new and very well maintained. You can obtained discounted access to the nearby Ebisu Club if you wanted a larger rec facility with pool. Gym is 24 hours.Recommendations: Absolutely, I love the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, but it was a real nice treat to retire to a very quiet area.

I am very picky and fussy about these things. I examined every inch of the room and bathroom, impressive. The vents of the air conditioning was completely spotless, the sinks, taps, toilets, corners of the room, tables, desks, the beds, the linens, pillows... etc. Spotless. Very impressive.The service was absolutely wonderful. Each staff would stop and bow and greet us every time we passed by. Elevators are quick, and always spotless as well. Concierge was brilliant. Arranged for our rental car to be delivered to the hotel upon our check out, got us maps, ensured we knew how to walk and get to restaurants we wanted to go to, arranged Takkyubin for our luggage to be forwarded to our next hotel without any hassle to us or bothered us. All was handled swiftly and efficiently.Staff spoke excellent english.The buffet breakfast at this hotel is one of the best we have had. It's a must try. Freshly squeezed juice offered, tons of pastries, bread, and omlette station, and lots of fruits, salads, cereals, sausages, fish.....and most beautiful of all was the Japanese breakfast buffet items. Loved it every morning.The ONLY thing guests may complain about is they charge 1800 yen a day for internet in the room. And, the toilet is NOT the typical electronic advanced ones you get usually in hotels nowadays.There is a room safe, and ironing board, and iron, and a nice flat screen huge TV, a desk, and the most comfortable ""heavenly"" bed with lots of fluffy pillows.Size of room was good, not huge, but bigger than many hotel rooms in Tokyo.For our price per night, we had a super deal. Whether this hotel is worth its money depends how much you get per night, but not looking at the price per night, this is a beautiful hotel no matter what.From the Narita airport, we took the airport limousine bus, it took 1 hour 45 minutes with no traffic jam.

Very friendly but not intrusive, although they absolutely insisted on helping me with my bags.The only drawback to this room is that the location is a bit far from Ebisu station - about 15 minutes, even with the moving walkways.

On both fronts the hotel met or exceeded my expectations. The room was comfortable and very quiet. I am not crazy about the faux classical styling (sort of like a nice hotel in Vegas only without the casino), but that's just personal taste and it is nice. I had a little difficulty getting the room as cool as I would like. The food in the hotel is generally excellent, especially the breakfast buffet (in my experience it is the best in Tokyo). I did not try the restaurants since they are so expensive (dinner at the teppanyaki place starts at $250 per person and goes up from there). The real stand out at this hotel, however, is service. I asked the hotel services manager for advice relating to the funeral I needed to attend, and was blown away by the thoughtful, attentive assistance I received, with follow-up on matters that I had not even considered asking about. Everyone I asked for assistance spoke good English and was very helpful. Beyond that, the location is good but not great. The hotel is a pretty long walk from Ebisu station, but a lot of that is via a moving walkway so it goes fast. There were not as many neighborhood restaurants as I would have expected. But it is easy to get around from there - overall a lot more convenient than someplace like the Park Hyatt, which is in a complete dead zone. I got a good running map from the front desk, and found the hotel gym to be very good. I did not go to the swimming pool, which is in a separate building and requires an extra charge. Overall, I would return for business or pleasure.","San Francisco, California","Snavedog</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",39,5.0

Glad I did not...the value, through SPG is great (though it was just reclassified as a Category 6 hotel, so its more pricey now)... The staff is amazing, very helpful, the rooms are massive, by any standard and the location is perfect. It is one of the stops on the Limo Bus shuttle from Narita, which I highly recommend (about $30 per person) and takes 1 and a half hours from NRT. We loved the location because it is close to the Ebisu stop on the Yamanote line and close to the Hibiya line stop. So, within 2 lines and 20 minutes, you can get almost anywhere you need to go in Tokyo. Also, the walk to the subway is quick and delightful, as you can stroll through the Yebisu garden palace, which is a great shopping area. I could write a whole other review on the garden palace, but the pastry shops outside are great and you must check out the food market on the bottom floor, it is the most insane food shopping experience I have ever seen. You also have the Sapporo factory across from the hotel, which is worth the 10 minute tour and cheap beer at the end.I saw some people complain about the walk with their bags from the subway to the hotel...I can see that being a little annoying, but with people movers it is easy and if you are coming from the airport, you should not be taking the train anyways, the bus is cheap and quick.The Westin is perfect...great as a base to travel around the city and nice to come home to at night for a relaxing stay.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","markbanshee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",33,5.0

No free internet which is always a gripe for me, but the comfort of the room was incredible, i had some dry cleaning done, and it was incredibly immaculate on it's return.I have only two gripes, and one was price (that said I was there over an exhibition peak period, but honestly almost 40,000 yen is really too much to pay per night for a Hotel, which is around $365, and this was without breakfast. I heard from other guests that the Breakfast was amazing, however, it was a bit of sushi on the run for me, travelling to the Big Shot Tokyo Exhibition centre each day.The othe gripe was the fact that because of my tattoos i wasn't allowed to use the stunning pool facilities, apparently because that it a bit 'Yakuza' which was a bit of a problem for me, as I mean in Europe it's remove everything, even underpants, and in Japan - given more conservative, but i mean Tattoo's are freedom of choice. But I digress, it's not a big deal.The location is smashing, and i really love this Ebisu region, close to Harijuko and the city station, and the people generally very friendly. I had one small incident, where I called the Westin Cho Sun - Seoul for my connecting hotel reservation, and this was charged to my account, i did mention that i was calling the same chain to make sure my reservation was in order, however, it didn't hold.The business centre guys were a bit vague, when i tried to book tickets to 'Wicked' the musical. In the end i opted to find the theatre myself and jumped in a cab. It was incredible, and i definately recommend it, even if you don't speak japanese. but i evidently wished that the business centre people were a bit more organised with what's happening in the most 'happening' city in the world.i definately recommend this hotel, it is magical, and the rooms and location are it's best asset.

Well, I'm no different as that represents an exceptional value. As a SPG Platinum, I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights over Christmas. Yes, I couldn't believe I could get a booking let alone getting C&P. I received a corner room while the other party received an adjoining regular room. Front desk advised the Exec floors were full and I do believe them. For a long time, the Westin was considered the top hotel in Tokyo, until the Ritz opened up. However, I do have to admit it's pretty luxurious. It reminds me of converted palazzos (into hotels) in Europe with its use of marble everywhere.My room was a very good size. No, it didn't have the ""Japanese"" toilet but I don't particularly care as it's not a novelty for me. However, the regular rooms do get this type of toilet. The rooms themselves were outfitted in high quality furnishings and I have zero complaints. The HVAC worked well and the ""do not disturb"" is activated by turning on a switch by the door - yes, just like the European luxe hotels.As an unintended benefit, my 2nd room also received Plat benefits. The Exec lounge had all sort of pastries on Christmas day as well as a rather large Christmas cake. There's a large selection of drinks and you can ask the attendant for alcoholic drinks free of charge. There's a very good expresso machine, too. On the 2nd day, I did come into the lounge during the last 10 min of h'ors d'oeurves hour. Although the zoo of people virtually guaranteed there to be almost nothing left, what was left was pretty good. Service was top notch. It is as expected of Japan but also taken a notch higher. I actually can't remember when I received service from other hotels of this calibre, regardless of country or continent.The location is good. As others have said, it's in Ebisu. NO, it's not a ""long walk"" from the train station to the hotel, unless you have a walking problem. The moving sidewalks make quick work of any distances you need to walk. I did eat at Atelier de Robuchon (the French chateau in front of the Westin) and it was decent. However, I prefer Enoteca Pinchiorri (Odaiba) more, but that's a different review. Tips: 1) The office tower complex in Ebisu houses some surprises. On the ground floor, there's a 24 hour convenience store. Next to that, there's a shop that offers free internet access WITH a computer. 2) In the same complex on the lower floor is a McDonald's, in case you're craving it. 3) On the top 2 floors of the same complex are upscale restaurants that offer an excellent view of Tokyo. 4) The exec lounge offers free wifi. You need to ask the attendant for the password. 5) There is a DVD player in the room. Conveniently enough, you can rent videos from Tsutaya next door. Just go to the business centre and ask them to borrow a Tsutaya membership. It's that easy. 6) As a Plat, I had free access to breakfast at either the Exec lounge or the ground floor restaurant. Take the ground floor restaurant for an unbelieve array of food and drink. I've already mentioned happy hour with h'ors d'oeurves in the Exec lounge.Would I return? Without hesitation.","Vancouver, BC","Braindrain</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, BC</strong>",307,5.0

The hotel restaurants were staggeringly expensive, but a nice italian restaurant was across the road. Fro the same money as at the hotel you could dine at Joel Rebuchon across the road. In the lower level of Joel Rebuchon and connected to the Westin is his branded patisserie which served the best french style baked goods I have had outside France.

With this deal, it cost us 90USD/night for a king-sized ""upgraded"" room, although I didn't really see what was upgraded about it, but I'll get to that later.Although the address states ""Meguro,"" the hotel is really located in Ebisu, which has I believe 4 JR lines that run through it. The one line that we used frequently was the Yamanote Line (a light greenish color). This line circles the city and is very convenient. Our NEX train dropped us off at Shinjuku station, where we transferred to the Yamanote line to Ebisu station. The walk through the covered walkway was a bit long (approximately 10 minutes) but definitely bearable. You don't even have to exit the walkway building to get to the Westin; just follow the signs in the basement level which will lead you straight into the basement of the Westin.The service is impeccable, as is with all establishments in Japan. They speak minimal English (and some even speak Chinese).Our room was a king-sized room with a small seating area and a flat panel, wide screen TV and DVD player. Unlike the previous poster, we did not have a special ""Japanese"" toilet; I was really looking forward to this! We had a plain regular toilet that didn't have a seat warmer nor a bidet function. There is a separate shower and tub area, which really came in handy when my husband needed to soak his tired feet and I just wanted to shower.The hotel is very clean and very impressive. There are many shops within the Ebisu Garden complex -- a McDonald's, a ramen noodle shop, a curry rice shop, a pharmacy/convenience store (Tomod's) and even a department store with a small supermarket in the lower level (Mitsukoshi).","New York City, New York","aquila19</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",144,4.0

We ended up with an upgraded room from the one king-size bedroom we had initially booked as they claimed that they were low on those particular rooms.Location wise, the Westin was about a 7 min walk from the Ebisu JR station (10 min to Tokyo Metro station) if you used the Skywalk. It's great if you are planning to hang out around Shibuya, Roppongi and Shijuku. However, it's a good 30 min subway ride up to Asakusa/Ueno if you plan on venturing to the other side of the city.The Yebisu Garden area where the hotel is located has a decent department store and lots of restaurants, including a Joel Robuchon just outside the hotel. If you don't feel like going out for expensive grub after a long day of going around Tokyo, just buy the cheap take-out food in the basement floor. That food is infinitely better than any mall food you can get in North America.Like other Westins that I have stayed before, the room was clean and comfortable. After spending the previous 8 days of our trip in hostels and ryokans around Japan, the Heavenly Bed sure was comfortable. The bathroom was well equipped with a shower and bathtub, heated toilet seats and bathroom accessories (in case you forgot to bring them). There was a TV and DVD player in the room as well with a decent selection of channels and music stations.I think what really stands out for this particular hotel was the service. The staff was very friendly and the service was excellent. Initially, when we got the room, there was a snafu with our reservation (this was after we had already got the deluxe room, by the way), but that was quickly cleared up. I was chatting with one of the hotel staff that it was our honeymoon in Tokyo and we had been travelling around Japan for more than a week. To our surprise, when we got back to the hotel that first night in the Westin, the hotel presented us with complimentary champagne to celebrate our trip. Very nice of them to do that.Overall, if you don't mind the long walk to the subway stations, I highly recommend this hotel for its comfort and service.","Burnaby, Canada","edmlam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Burnaby, Canada</strong>",2,5.0

Ebisu is easily accessible by train, but the hotel is located on a hill ABOVE the train station. It is not that easy to reach the Westin when travelling with heavy bags or young children. Eebisu is a quiet neighborhood compared to Shinjuku or Ginza, yet you will find many dining options in the area.The hotel is very nice. It has a really fancy deco - marble in many areas, columns (!) in the room, and gold accents. rooms are clean and well appointed. The hotel being located above the city, we had a view on the Mount Fuji from our room!

It is a very classy hotel located in the Yebisu Garden district.The hotel is done up in that Japanese styled European elegance that must have been popular during the bubble. Service is impeccable and the hotel has recently added a Westin workout facility that's top notch. Rooms are nice, typical of what you'd expect for a Westin, and decent size. Bathrooms are marble/granite in construction and nice seperate stall shower and tub. And of course the room features an exciting high tech Japanese toilet. The hotel features an executive lounge with cocktails in the evening and breakfast in the morning for frequent guests. Cocktails are generous with full bar and nice selection of appetizers. The breakfast is also generous and filled with amusing options such as green salad (for breakfast?). The Westin staff has learned a bit about western tastes since I was last at the property and are now serving crispy bacon alongside the limp traditional offering.The Yebisu Garden complex provides a lot of dining options (so you're not limited to the $150 ""sushi sampler"" on the room service menu) as well as shopping and international ATM at a post office branch. I ate at a traditional tonkatsu location (Japanese fried pork that tastes a bit like weiner schnitzel) and at a yakiniku (Japanese style Korean BBQ) restaurant, but the options were varied and offered options in a variety of price ranges.So...what's not to like? Unfortunately the one major drawback to the Westin is its location. The Ebisu subway station is a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel through the Yebisu Garden complex, and Ebisu is not necessarily close to traditional Tokyo business districts. Check into this consideration when booking your stay as at the end of a long business day or sightseeing venture this could be a drawback.","Estella, Spain","stumptowntraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Estella, Spain</strong>",11,4.0

I was a little worried about the location in Tokyo but with how efficient the subways are we found it was just a few minute ride to any location we wanted to see. It was 2 stops to Roppongi Hills and about 5 stops to the fish market (about as far as you need to go in Tokyo). The hotel was classy, elegant and the room had fabulous features. The shower was wonderful, the bathroom was very modern and our bedroom had an area with a couch and chair. There were two options for breakfast-a buffet on the 1st floor which was excellent and a continental breakfast if you were an SPG preferred guest. Both were very nice for us.

But there was no need for us to worry, upon arrival at the hotel doors, our luggage was whisked away, check-in was fast and friendly and we are in our room in no time. Our room was on the top floor (21st) and we had panoramic view of Tokyo.The room itself was western-styled and bigger than a standard Japanese hotel room. The bathroom was elegant without being ostentatious. And as expected, everything in the room was clean and in-order.Service was top-class. Our calls to the service express office were promptly answered and the required service we wanted met. The business centre staff went out of their way and lent us their office computer to check emails when all the terminals were being used by other guests. The consierge was also very helpful in providing maps, timetables and other information.The location of the hotel is less hectic than say Shinjuku or Shibuya, but the with the train & subway station less than a 10 minute walk away one can easily travel to other parts of the city. The area around the hotel also has a lot of interesting places to see, the Ebisu Garden Place is across the street, restaurants abound and there are a number of ""hip"" places/shops like the Tokyo store of Maison Martin Margiela.","Sydney, Australia","lycook</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",32,5.0

Our experience at the Tokyo Westin was excellent.We redeemed Starwood points for the six-night stay in a superior king-bedded room. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by all the staff in the motor coach area. Our bags were quickly whisked away andwe were led to the check-in desk by one of the staff. The transition from the airport shuttle bus to the check-in desk was seemless and handled very professionally. At check in, we were offered an upgrade to an Executive Floor room with breakfast and executive lounge privileges for 7000 yen a night (about $60 a night). (Since we are just Gold, we would not have received either of these otherwise). We figured it was worth it sincewould eliminate the stress of finding a place to have breakfast everymorning. Plus, all those free drinks and appetizers do add up over the course of six days. We took the upgrade.The room was very nice. We were in a corner king-bedded room on the 14th floor with a wonderful view of Shibuya, Shinjuku and Roppongi. As referenced in prior reviews, the decor is definitely more Western than Asian-influenced. However, the room was very tastefully decorated and the carpet, walls and furntiure were in excellent condition. The room had a separate sitting area with a couch, lounging chair, coffee table and cocktail table. Marble columns framed the sitting area. The bed was comfortable, but it is not your typical Westin Heavenly Bed. It is a bit firmer than those beds. There was also a makeup table and mirror adjacent to the bed. The bathroom had marble floors and accents. There was a separate shower and tub. The products were replenished daily and there is a kit with all sorts of items if you forget to bring some from home (e.g., toothbrush, toothpaste, etc).Unlike other reports on here, we found the buffet breakfast to be perfectly acceptable and quite good. The breakfast selection includes: made to order eggs, scrambled eggs, oven-basked eggs, crispy and regular bacon, two different types of sausage links, potatoes (sometimes broiled, sometimes mashed), asparagus, rice, a daily chicken dish, a daily pasta dish, miso and other soups, all types of breads and pastries, pancakes, waffles, doughnuts, cereals, yogurt, and all kinds of Japanese breakfast items (including some sushi). There are all sorts of freshly squeezed juices, milk and excellent coffee. There is a bakery at the entrance to the restuarantthat makes amazing desserts. We tried several over the course of our stay and they were always very, very good. The service at the breakfast restaurant and at the bakery was top notch. Glasses were refilled regularly and without request. The entire staff was extremely friendly, attentive and bent over backwards to please us. We took advantage of the executive lounge on a daily basis. In addition to the drinks and snacks available throughout the day, thereis a daily happy hour from 5:30-7:30 p.m. There were 6-8 different types of appetizers set up daily. The selection varied from day to day, so there was no way to get bored. The drinks included soft drinks, juices, beer, wine and liquor. Once again, the staff at the executive lounge was extremely friendly and attentive. The common areas of the hotel are very well maintained. The lobby is gorgeous and there was no stench of smoke anywhere. As for the hotel's location, it is located in the neighborhood of Ebisu. For those of you that want the craziness and lights of Shinjuku or Shibuya, this is not your hotel. This hotel is a residential neighborhood and a bit secluded from the craziness of Tokyo nightlife. However, the Ebisu JR and subway stations are a brisk 5-minute walk from the hotel. There are even moving sidewalks to help you along the way. We found the location very convenient to moving around Tokyo on the JR and subway line, and it was quite nice to return to a quiet, more residential abode in the evenings after spending all day in the hussle of the city. Ebisu Garden Place is adjacent to the hotel and includes a Mitsukoshi department store, Beer Garden and Grill, Italian eaterie and other restuarants (Joel Robuchon is located in a beautiful mini-palace building), McDonald's and an office buiding that houses Morgan Stanley.Overall, I must say that our experience at the Tokyo Westin ranks as one of the best we have had at any hotel worldwide. The service we received at the hotel from every staff member hotel-wide was top notch. I was actually very depressed to leave the Westin Tokyo and check into the Westin Osaka (but that is another review). We will definitely return to the Westin Tokyo when we are back in Tokyo, and we highly recommend it to others. We are truly shocked that this hotel is not rated higher on TripAdvisor.","Chicago, Illinois","njsplanet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",365,5.0

BUT, this time I left it up to him (and his company) to choose where we stayed and I just went with it.On the last leg (and night) of a 10-day trip, we landed at the Westin Tokyo and we were pleasantly surprised!Check-in was very fast and my boyfriend upgraded us to a Club/Executive room which included free breakfast and happy hour for an extra $700 yen/night - totally worth it! I think we paid $350 total for our night stay.Back to the Club floor later, but let's start with the lobby! Really, really beautiful!! Lots of highly polished black marble, soaring ceilings and just very pleasing to the eye. There is a cafe/bakery, a formal restaurant and a restaurant/bar right off the loby - and that's all the farther we got past the room and the Club floor - so I can't speak of the other amenities in the hotel.Our room was 1608 and we had an amazing view of the city and the Tokyo Tower! It was cool during the day, but stunning at night! We got some great photos!! I only read a few reviews, but the one mentioning no view must have stayed on a very low floor or on another side of the building I never saw. BEAUTIFUL!The room was very large and had the super comfortable Heavenly Bed (king), a sofa and table, desk and another table and chair....very roomy. The bedding is white, crisp and soft - the pillows comfy. And the bathroom was gorgeous! Big bath tub, separate shower and a large vanity. Very, very nice!The bath products smelled great, there were lots of towels and they provided us with a travelers kit with a brush, toothbrush, q-tips, etc which you could take with you if you chose. Nice touch.We took advantage of the Club/Executive floor and headed up there after we checked in. There was a nice assortment of hard alcohol, beer, 2 red and 2 white wines, as well as juices and sodas. They also served really nice appetizers including salmon, chicken, duck and various other snacks. We sat and enjoyed several glasses of wine and the food, along with the beautiful view!!In the morning the breakfast consisted of the usual - eggs, sausage, fruits, pastries, cereals, juices, etc and they were quick to replenish plates.We did eat at the restaurant in the bar area - Brian got a chicken sandwich and I got the risotto (we had maxed out on Chinese and sushi!) and we thought it was fine. Not fabulous, but good. The prices were moderately high, but it's Tokyo and you're in a hotel!!! We expected to pay $15 for a chicken sandwich! There are several places nearby that we passed in the cab that looked very cute if you don't want to pay hotel prices.We felt the hotel was lovely and we were very happy with our stay. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this Westin to all of my friends.The only thing I'd say is that if you are looking for action, this really isn't the location for you. My boyfriend though he booked a hotel in Ginza, but this was miles away and would take 20+ minutes by cab to get there. We did take a cab to the Roppongi District and that main street was BUSY!!! Lots of clubs and restaurants to choose from. I think if we were to go again on our own (sans business,) we'd choose to stay in a more convenient area. If you are looking for a beautiful hotel in a quiet and upscale part of Tokyo, this is the place for you!Lisampls","Eden Prairie, Minnesota","lisampls</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Eden Prairie, Minnesota</strong>",343,5.0

How wrong I was. Although in the traditional style rather than modern, the décor was more than sufficient and the room enormous. With great views towards the gardens and a relatively commanding view of the city, it was all topped off with the great Heavenly bed and very large bathroom.One nice thought here was the toiletry bags with every possible thing in that you could need (apart from hair products and deodorant), so no need to worry about restrictions on carrying liquids on your flight if you are coming to the Westin here. You can also take these home.Arrival was superb and I was upgraded to an executive deal including free internet and free breakfast. Gym facilities were good and the bar in the reception area had a lot of charm compared with most other hotel lobby bars. Room service was great – order a beer and they will wheel in an actual bar with beer pump and serve you right there and then. Marvellous!The location of the Westin will not be ideal for everyone but is around 7 minute walk to Yebisu station and is right next to a shopping complex with all the stores you would need for last minute shopping, drugstore items or snacks and food.Not outstanding, but 4 stars for overall high quality and non-fussy delivery of the core Westin product.","Whitley Bay, United Kingdom","mguyb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Whitley Bay, United Kingdom</strong>",16,4.0

I was there for business and this hotel was chosen for me due to the proximity to the office.I had a very good experience at this hotel. Upon check-in, I was told that I had been given a very special room on the ladies floor. Apparently this is a new idea at the Westin and obviously just for women. All services including porter, room service, maid service, etc. are performed by women and no men are allowed on the floor. I was somewhat skeptical, but when I got to my room, I was very pleasantly surprised. Towards the end of the week, I moved to a ""regular"" room on a different floor so I can make an accurate comparison. My room on the ladies floor had the same furnishings and layout as a regular room but the extras included Bulgari bath products (wonderful smell!), a yoga mat and instructional DVD in the room, ionic hairdryer, female-specific toiletries like bath oil beads and salts, hair bands and clips, loofah, etc.Overall, both my rooms were very large by Tokyo standards, the Westin Heavenly bed can't be beat and the service is wonderful, very consistent with Tokyo in general.On a previous trip to Tokyo, I stayed at the New Otani in Akasaka and the only thing I liked more about that hotel was the location. The Westin Tokyo is in Ebisu which I personally didn't find too lively although there is some shopping and good restaurants and the Metro and JR lines are close by to take you to more ""happening"" parts of the city.My only complaint with the hotel is that the on-site restaurants are ridiculously priced. I chose to purchase the Executive package with my room which included 50% off internet charge, happy hour and appetizers and breakfast included on the Executive floor. On my last day I woke up too late to take advantage of my free breakfast and paid the regular price in the cafe downstairs. I think it was more than US$30 for 2 eggs, 2 sausage and 2 small pastries. Tea and juice were of couse extra as well.

For example, the bathroom had an amenities kit with toothpaste, razor, etc. and every day the staff replaced every single item in the kit--and didn't just put it on the counter, they put it in the proper spot in the kit, zipped it closed and placed it in its spot on the counter. That's pretty amazing in my book. My only ding on this place was for room service.

The hotel staff was friendly, helpful, and for the most part spoke English. The concierge who each day helped us arrange for a tour or indicated which train we needed to take was especially helpful. It was raining during our stay; fortunately the hotel provided us with two umbrellas each morning on our way out of the door - which I though was a nice touch of hospitality.The Ebisu subway station is a short 10 minute walk from the hotel (you can ride the moving walkways for at least half of the distance). The hotel is conveniently located on the west side of Tokyo and you are no more than 15 minutes away (by subway) from Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, Roppongi, Ginza, or Tokyo station. Lucky for us Yebisu Gardens (adjacent to the hotel) shows English language films on a giant outdoor screen during July and August (last night we watched Chicago) and best of all it is free of charge. The room was clean, well maintained, and comfortable. The only not-so positive comment I have is that the restaurants in the hotel are a bit on the expensive side (relatively speaking of course, since we are in Tokyo).

I've stayed at a couple of other hotels in Tokyo and still prefer this one over some of the others. Nothing beats the Heavenly Beds at the Westin chains and this one is just like all the others. They had a choice of 2 different types of pillows so you can sleep in comfort. In addition, the staff was very helpful. The concierge will be happy to supply you with maps and directions to wherever you need to go. They were also helpful in writing questions like ""Can you recommend a good sake?"" in Japanese so that I can just take it to the department store of my choosing.I only had one negative experience during this trip but it was rectified so in the end I was happy. While the rate is really good (I think it's about US$10 for a 7-day access card), access is only available in the lobby and unfortunately for my laptop was unrealiable. So unrealiable that I had to complain. The first time I complained, they did not offer me any other option but the second time I complained, the concierge offered to give me access to the wireless access on the club room floor for no additional charge. On the club room floor I had no problems accessing the internet. Upon check-out, they had even removed the initial 7-day access card fee. In terms of location, it is close to the Ebisu station on the JR line and Hibiya line. It was very convenient for me both for my business meetings and personal shopping (in Shibuya, Harajuku, and Shinjuku).For those traveling with a JR railway pass that you buy before you go to Japan (a good deal if you're going to other cities in Japan), you should also note that the JR railway pass is good for the JR 'subway' line in Tokyo. You just have to show your pass to the attendant. In comparison, I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt and the Cerulean Tower. I probably prefer the Grand Hyatt over the Westin but it does generally cost more. Plus, I'm not a fan of the Roppongi area. As for the Cerulean Tower, it was a good hotel as well but the service level (while still exceptional over North American hotels) was below both of the other hotels.

However, I had a wonderful stay and was quite impressed by the excellent service. I saw no difference in the treatment of Japanese vs non-Japanese guests by the hotel staff. Indeed, staff were always attentive and had a good command of English. Concierge services were excellent. Breakfast buffet was OK and reasonably priced. Hotel restaurants were great (particularly the Teppanyaki restaurant on the 22nd floor), although a bit overpriced, but that is the norm in hotel restaurants in Japan. Room was huge by Japanese standards with great beds (heavenly beds) and very good views. Bathroom was also huge, with separate shower/bathtub facilities; good water pressure in the shower. I am not a fan of the hotel's French faux-European decoration, but I tended to overlook it, since the hotel is excellently maintained. Location is not as central as other hotels in Marounouchi, but it is very convenient to such areas as Shibuya, Shinjuku, Omotesando, Roppongi and Shinagawa (via the subway or the JR Yamanote line). Hotel is connected by underground passages via the Yebisu Garden Place to the Ebisu station (about 10 minutes away), so you can avoid bad weather conditions. Also, the Yebisu Garden Place is a very nice area with a good department store (Mitsukoshi) and a large choice of restaurants.

'05 and we had some pretty bad experiences. We arrived to the hotel at 3am after a night out and all of our key cards were cancelled and when we went to the desk we were treated as if we were criminals. Ultimately they figured out that when we checked in that the desk staff had entered the wrong check-out date and it was their mistake. We had to wait until after 5:30 am for them to figure this out. The general manager said that we should have been allowed to enter our room and that it should have been taken care of during the day. The NAZI desk staff would not budge as we were foreigners. I live in JAPAN and speak Japanese so I was following the conversations. It would have been handled differently had the guests been Japanese. This is the down side of being a foreigner in Japan sometimes but I would have expected more from the WESTIN HOTEL. We lost a day of our trip to TOKYO because of this. We splept through a tour we had planned and we were unable to re-book it. We were given many ""sorry's"" and many deep bows and were given one night for free but it soured our hotel experience. Tokyo was AWESOME so I suggest you look for another hotel to fully appreciate this GREAT city!! The desk supervisor arranged reservations for my two friends in the TEPPAN YAKI STEAK HOUSE on the 22nd floor for their last night in TOKYO and when they arrived they had to wait 20 minutes to be told that it would have to take 1 MORE HOUR for them to get a table because they lost the reservation!! What kind of service is that? They offered to send them out of the hotel to another place but they waited and when they got the check they were charged a table charge and my friend refused to pay it. The next morning I had to call the hotel's general manager and the general manager in the KYOTO WESTIN who will be the new GM in TOKYO soon to get that dinner taken off of their total bill. That meal should have been complimentary to begin with. This would most likely not happen in other credible 5-star hotels. There are better hotels closer to the action than the WESTIN. KEEP SEARCHING! By the way, we were allowed to eat the lunch buffet as a result of us sleeping through breakfast the day we were locked out and the food was terrible. The breakfast was never great either. The executive room on the 17th floor was fairly crowded and tables were often full of dirty dishes and guests had to stand around to wait for tables to be cleared.

It is in a slightly remote location on the southwest side of town, but the both train and subway is a 10 minute walk away facilitated by covered moving walkways (after crossing the courtyard of a nice upscale shopping area, the Ebisu Garden).I do have to admit the hotel is on the pricey side, but with the current exchange rate, most are overpriced when considering the US dollar. Also, try to avoid a corner room, although comfortable in design, the regular rooms are larger. There is a bus shuttle for Narita that stops at the hotel hourly - 3000 yen (currently about $30 US) and takes about two hours.","cambridge,ma","thrllkll</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>cambridge,ma</strong>",6,4.0

Not to mention in a great area, near shops and restaurants. The staff is very attentive and always waiting to help. The bathrooms were beautiful with marbel. We were in our rooms on the 16th floor when the earthquake hit 2 weeks ago and had no idea the entire city is built for that. That was an interesting experience. The only negative is that we went to the top floor piano bar for a drink and had no idea that they charge a $12.50 per person cover charge. That seemed to be mentioned on the drink menu once you were already inside. Otherwise, would definately go there again!","Los Angeles,ca","Extraordinary7214</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles,ca</strong>",7,5.0

Its rooms are among the biggest and best-equipped in the city, it has fast broadband internet service with reliable VPN connections, its health club is one of the best equipped and most comprehensive in Japan (with a plethora of cardio/weight machines, swimming pool, saunas, and even racquetball courts), it has a comprehensive and efficient business center and excellent concierge service, and its overall service quality is consistently superior. Another positive is that the service staff remembers the little things--such as my favorite international newspapers and breakfast buffet preferences. About the only downside to the hotel is its location--in slightly out-of-the-way Ebisu--which is about half-way between Meguro/Shinagawa and Shibuya/Shinjuku, on the western side of Tokyo. However, the Yebisu Gardens development that the Westin is a part of is quite self-contained, with several office towers and high-end apartment complexes housing multinational corporations and their ex-patriate staffs, and an adjacent mall anchored by a large department store, an upscale grocery store ($80 melons, anyone?), a well-stocked pharmacy-drugstore, and numerous boutiques, beer halls, and a broad range of restaurants (from all manners of Japanese to Korean to Chinese to Thai to Italian to German to McDonalds).The French-lacquered decor of the immaculately-polished lobby and the rooms is very distinctive--although I lean more towards simple, modernistic furnishings. However, it is apparently a favorite of brides and grooms in Tokyo as the hotel is often filled to the brim on weekends with as many as a dozen separate wedding engagements. So don't be surprised to run into wedding parties dressed in both western and traditional Japanese garb in the common areas.All in all, the Westin Tokyo provides unparalleled amenities and seamless service for business and for pleasure. Based on my past experiences, I would highly recommend it.","Denver, Colorado","Happiness36014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",14,5.0

I researched a lot on the internet about the hotel and its surroundings. I have heard from others who stayed here that it is convenient to get around, and you can walk through the walkway for 5 minutes from the station to get to the hotel. And this turned out to be the only thing bad about getting to the hotel. With a big suitcase, the walk from the station to the hotel is long and tiring. We realized later that the MAIN entrance is on the other side, but sice we were always using the trains, we always ended up using the walkway. But now the hotel. The hotel is so grand! The lobby is clean and well kept. Check in was very smooth and the bellman escorted us to our room. First thing we said when he opened the door was, ""Wow..."" I felt bad even staying here. It was that nice. The minibar is packed with Sapporo beer (I hear that they are the owner?) and I was surprised to see a very packed liquor collection when I opened one of the drawers. The Westin hotels are known for their heavenly bed, and yes, it was! Very comfortable. The bathroom was amazing. There were both a bathtub and a shower. The vanity was beautiful and was packed with amenities. Even the shampoos were not those cheapy ones you see in most hotels. There is also a green pouch with amenities you can use during your stay. I did not get to try the restaurants, but I would definitely stay here again and try everything i missed. There is also a Tsutaya video store next door if you feel like buying CD's and Videos. I did!","Honolulu, HI","alohapop</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, HI</strong>",86,5.0
