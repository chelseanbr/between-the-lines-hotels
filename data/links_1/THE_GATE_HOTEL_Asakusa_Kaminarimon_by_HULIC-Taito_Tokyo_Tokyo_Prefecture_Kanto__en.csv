The hotel is situated in a good location, close to the railway station and the main tourist sight (Sensoji) in the area. At first glance the hotel doesn't look much on the outside, but once you enter your opinion soon changes. You're initially greeted with a lovely smell as you enter and when you go to the reception on the top floor it's difficult not to be impressed by the view. The room itself was a reasonable size for Tokyo and the bed comfortable. The biggest plus though is the rooftop terrace where you can view cross the city towards Skytree.

I expected space to be tight, and by my over-sized American standards, it was just that — both in the photos and in person. However, when my wife and I settled in, we realized that it was exactly everything we needed. We didn’t need a hotel room the size of a small apartment, we needed it to be functional and provide a great place to get sleep — and The Gate Hotel did both brilliantly. There was no wasted space, and the decor made it a perfect atmosphere for catching some shut eye after a long day of roaming Tokyo. The grounds of the hotel, from the lobby to the restaurant, were comfortable, relaxing, and had astonishing views of Tokyo including the Skytree Tower. Unfortunately, my wife and I didn’t go up to the terrace, but we really didn’t need to. But like the title of the review suggests, it was the staff who were the highlight. They were very kind, patient, and attentive. Honestly this is part of the charm of Japan in general, but being they were our first real interaction with the locals, it jumped out in ways that I have rarely experienced in the US.

The check-in process was a breeze, the staff arranged a next day courier for our luggage to our next hotels effortlessly and their English was of a very good standard. We booked one of the more premium corner view rooms for the last night and wished we had booked this room for the previous nights we had stayed there - it was only £15 more expensive per night, but was a much bigger, brighter room with great views and a corner window letting in much more light than the slightly darker, boxier room we had before. It was nice to find vending machines situated on all of the floors, meaning you could grab a beer or a snack without having to travel to the 7-11.

We struggled through the door with our cases into a small vestibule containing nothing other than four lifts and a notice advising reception was on floor 13. No reception, no porters or concierge desk – we bundled our cases into a lift.Reception was a modest affair on the 13th floor with a small seating area to one side and a bar and dining room to the other side. The view of the Sky Tree was about all that was. All in all not what we were expecting! Having checked in we struggled with our cases back into the lift and went to our room on the 12th floor. Our Classy King room was anything but classy, modest would have been a better description; décor was very dark colours which made it claustrophobic. The toilet and separate shower cubicle were also quite simple affairs. It transpired that the hotel had no lounge, the roof terrace, such as it was, was mostly closed. Service was patchy and the breakfasts turned out to be in keeping with our impression of the hotel, very basic, very limited breakfast selection e.g. one juice, one cereal and patchy service, on our second morning my eggs benedict failed to arrive.We had booked our stay for three nights after which we left The Gate to travel to Hakone, leaving the majority of our baggage at The Gate and returning three days later for an overnight stay and reuniting with our luggage before joining the Queen Elizabeth for a cruise.On arrival for our second stay at The Gate at about 12:15 we were told check in was not until 2:00pm. We left our cases at reception and went for a walk and coffee at a nearby Starbucks before returning at 1:50. No our room was not ready check in is 2:00pm. At 2:00pm I tried again, ”no not ready yet come back in 10 minutes”. 2:10 “sorry no not ready 10 more minutes” At 2:20 we were not prepared to take no for an answer. We had a different Classy King room this time on the 10th floor. Whilst the room was the same dark modest room this time it featured an awful outlook over the air conditioning units of the adjacent building.On both occasions the corridors were always restricted by numerous housekeeping carts overflowing with laundry and cleaning materials – as mentioned in other Trip Advisor reviews.All in all we would categorise The Gate , whilst well located, as being a somewhat 3 star tourist hotel with limited facilities, indifferent service, poor breakfast , and indifferent service.

There are western style options but we've had far better in Japan. The hotel has a top floor bar with spectacular views of the Skytree and the Tokyo skyline. It's restricted to residents only, so it's hardly used. We went for a drink after dinner and apart from another couple from Belgium, we were the only customers. The barman spoke almost no English and had absolutely no idea how to mix a cocktail - we ordered a Singapore Sling, but what we got was nothing like the real thing. Mostly ice and no fruit in sight.

This is a superb location that mixes modern downtown with ancient temples and sites. The Gate’s lobby is on the 13th floor. There is an open lobby, with limited seating, reception desks and their restaurant and bar area. The rooms are compact, but functional, their bathrooms were ok (nothing to write about). We had two rooms and they had the foresight to put us together, which was nice – we didn’t need to ask as we had in several of our stops on our trip.There does seem to be a disconnect between the hotel and the restaurant. One of the reasons why we picked this place (besides the location) was based on the reviewers’ comments of their restaurant AND the hotel boasts about 24-hour service. When we checked in (around 4:30) we were ready for an early bite, since we had not taken a lunch earlier in the day. We were told that the restaurant wouldn’t be ready for dinner until 5. ? – so much for 24 hour service. We would wait and have a cocktail, but all of the tables were reserved (except one in a back room). We could, however, drink/dine on the balcony. It was cold and inclement, but we were given blankets for our laps. We asked if we would eat at the bar, and that was acceptable. They serve excellent cocktails but are a bit slow in concocting them. Once we finally placed our food order it was over 45 minutes before we got our food and by that time the place was packed. Our food was cold. We experienced another food malfunction the next day at breakfast. It looks like they have a great buffet, but we arrived a little late for the buffet so ordered off the menu. We ordered the highly recommended curried Benedict, and eggs Benedict, which came out immediately, but cold. The third order, French toast, came out 20 minutes later and was reportedly delicious. Bottom line is the restaurant needs some shaping up. Food should come out together, and should be hot, if it is expected to be hot. The curry wasn’t anything to brag about.However, if you’re not there for the food (there are some amazing restaurants nearby), the hotel is worth the stay. The staff are gracious and welcoming and certainly try to accommodate you. Some of the best views of the Asakusa area are from the roof top. It is a great location.","Denver, Colorado","Dvrnative</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",40,4.0

Food:Halal food is readily accessible in the vicinity from kebab to sushi to ramen to western and even North Indian food.. Nakamise dori has plenty of halal snacks and souvenirs which we kept returning to since we are right across from it... what’s not to love. (Just get the asakusa map for muslim travellers and u know what i mean) Breakfast, lunch and dinner just a walk away anytime we wanted with plenty of choices.. can’t imagine what it’s like for other muslim travellers when they’re staying somewhere else. Location:Very close to Asakusa station and it was super convenient to return to Narita. Asakusa on the ginza line leads directly to Shibuya and we were also able to get to Maihama after two quick train transfers. Just a few stops away from Ueno (if you need the main Yamanote line). Convenience:As a family, essentials are important so it is a BIG huge plus for us that a supermarket and a local drug store is just downstairs.. whatever you need just at the doorstep. Starbucks is just 5-10m away and our go-to for that daily matcha frappe, iced cocoa and tea latte after a long day of exploring. Service:Housekeeping was efficient and kept the room neat and tidy daily. Pyjamas are given so you dont even need to bring your own. We were pampered with clean PJs and towels everyday. Love it! I drink plenty of water and even though I kept asking for more bottles, they were always obliging. Even gave us two Japanese two pin plugs for us to charge our iphones and ipads. (We forgot that Japan uses a different type of plug)The only reason I hesitated on giving it a full 5 stars was because we were staying there during my birthday but the staff did not make an effort to send any birthday wish or greeting. I wasnt expecting anything complimentary but it would have been a lovely personal touch. Having said that, my husband was down with fever on one night and we did call to request for medication since the shops were already closed. They came promptly with fever medication.On the day we checked out, the staff even asked about my husband and we really appreciate this concern. Would we stay there again if we are in Tokyo again?

It is not 5 stars but suits us fine as we spent most of our time out exploring and don’t need the hotel facilities. The rooms and bathrooms are quite big by Tokyo standards and beds comfortable. Wi-Fi is ok. We like the Asakusa area for its retro feel. There are 2 subway stations within a few minutes walk and many dining options. There’s a supermart, Starbucks and Matsumoto drugstore below the hotel. Walking past an illuminated Sensoji temple at night evokes a very different feeling, it’s almost serene without the crowd.I would like to add that I’m most impressed with the service by a Front Desk staff (sorry I forgot her name, only saw a Trainee tag..). I was given a smoking room when I checked in. Whilst I always select the non-smoking option, I’m not sure if I’d made a mistake in my haste as the booking was only done the day before (via a 3rd party provider). The hotel was full that night and could only change me to a non-smoking room the next day. Throughout the check-in process, the Front Desk staff kept apologizing for not being able to help me for the first night. She even asked housekeeping to spray air freshener to musk as much of the smell as possible. As the room was not ready by the normal check in time of 3pm, we decided to sit at the hotel cafe and she arranged complimentary coffee and hot choc while we wait. This to me, is good service delivery and human touch.Overall we’d a nice stay at the hotel. P/S: for first timers to Tokyo, I’m not sure if Asakusa is the best area to stay as it’s about 30 mins train ride from the Shinjuku/Shibuya/Harajuku tourist belts. Shinjuku is perhaps my first choice if visiting for the first time.

The set up was actually two full size beds placed together.

The bathroom had one area for shower and tub and a separate area for toilet and sink. Shower was great, good pressure and temperature.

It’s close to the iconic Senso-ji temple and has a lot of older shopping streets nearby. There are shops where you can rent a yukata for the day and take a trip with the rickshaws and fill all those Japanese stereotypes. For those who want to spend more time shopping in Shinjuku, Shibuya or even at Tokyo station, this hotel is not that convenient. The Ginza line metro station is closeby but Asakusa is the first stop so going to Ginza takes about 20 mins and even longer to Shibuya and will require changing trains to most other destinations (eg Tsukiji Market, Harajuku, Shinjuku etc). The Narita Keisei Express does go directly to Asakusa but is on the Toei line so beware the walk is about 10 mins instead of 3 mins to the closer Ginza line. Personally, I would find it more convenient to stay at a hotel in Shinjuku or near Ginza or Tokyo station with direct limousine bus access.

We found a cute place for breakfast a few blocks away called Suke 6 Diner. Fabulous food, we were looking for a good non Japanese breakfast after 3 weeks in the country and nothing but Japanese food. We did have breakfast the last morning at the hotel and it was very nice. They have several main courses to choose from, we had the eggs Benedict and french toast and both were excellent. The buffet was some fruit, vegetables and bread products, also they were making home squeezed orange juice that was amazing. The problems noted in past reviews about being hard to get a table were also an issue for us, but we just asked to sit at the bar and were seated immediately. This was a very comfortable option. The one thing we were not happy with was that the lobby is on the 13th floor, as such there is no one at the front door to help you with bags or get you up to the lobby to check in. We had to lug our bags to the street when we left and flag down a taxi on the street to get to the train station. We would definitely come back next time in Tokyo.

We had been travelling for 18 hours from London via Singapore and really appreciated this no hassle arrival.Our room was on the 9th floor and as expected was small with very little space for our luggage. The bathroom was excellent with a wet room which had a wonderful shower with extremely hot water and strong flow. Everything we needed was provided and with a firm bed we had three relaxing nights.There are a number of restaurants nearby in what is a popular area of Tokyo, but we left it too late on the second evening, so we had dinner in the restaurant which is an extension to the long, thin bar area off the main lobby. The food was mainly aimed at Western tastes but was well cooked and presented and not too expensive. Beer was reasonably priced but wine quite dear for the amount served.Breakfast was expensive and not being great fans of buffets we decided to do something we never do in the UK - go to Starbucks. There is a branch two minutes from the hotel (turn left and its on the same side of the street) and it provided all that we wanted - loads on Europeans, Americans and Australians were there together with many Japanese.The views from the lobby and roof top bar (not open when we were there due to the rain) are very impressive and give a good indication of the sprawl that is Tokyo.We had been told about the luggage forwarding service that exists in Japan and decided to make use of this on check out. We decided to send our large suitcases to the next but one destination and just took an overnight bag to the hotel we were staying at on the evening of our check out.The receptionist said that this would be easy but warned that because of the forecast typhoon there was a possibility of the bags being delayed by a day.As we were staying for a couple of days, we were happy to take the risk. However, when we arrived at our hotel in Kanazawa, the bags were waiting for us. The cost was approx. £ 24.00 and it was money well spent - just give them the address of the next hotel, pay the fee, get a receipt and (in our case just relax) - things are very efficient in Japan.Overall, I would be happy to stay here again as The Gate provided a comfortable base from which to travel easily around Tokyo using the marvellous and quite easily navigable underground system.",london england,"mixers</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>london england</strong>",128,5.0

The location in Asakusa was great – near lots of dining and shopping and subways. The interior is bright, modern and new. The room was expectedly small but very comfortable and we slept well. Loved the cotton pajamas that they provided. The front desk staff were all very helpful and patient. Bu sure to check out the city view from the lobby (which is on the upper floor rather than the ground floor) and stop into the roof top bar. They went above and beyond in several ways to make our stay special. First - we are vegetarian; it’s somewhat hard to find vegan/vegetarian food in Japan. But the restaurant was so very accommodating in providing meatless breakfasts for us. I was so impressed with the beautifully arranged fruit platters that they made for us, and that he took the time to point out all of the vegan options on the buffet (for example, he said that the potatoes were cooked in the same oil as the meat so we shouldn’t have them), and offered to remove the bacon from my eggs benedict. Secondly – it was my birthday and they made it special by upgrading our room, giving me a small gift, and a most beautiful hand-made origami birthday card. Even without the gifts, I would recommend this hotel and I would be happy to stay there on my next visit.

We booked online a few months prior and received great follow up service from staff confirming our booking closer to the date and checking if we needed assistance with reservations. Once we arrived, we were very impressed by the quality of the room, service and location. The neighbourhood is both traditional (the hotel is across the road from the Nakamise-dōri market and Sensō-ji temple complex) and modern (lots of shops, restaurants and public transport within an easy walking distance). The hotel itself is clean, quiet and modern. Check-in was very impressive; the lobby is located on one of the top floors of the building and offers amazing views of the area. We stayed in a Hollywood Twin room, which was fairly spacious (we were expecting tiny rooms in Japan) and had a large bathroom/wet room. Unfortunately the room wasn't big enough for a cot but our toddler could easily sleep in our very large bed between us. The bathroom had a separate wet room with a shower and (small) bathtub. It was great, though, because there was so much room to have your shower, and also amazing toiletries (best shampoo, conditioner and shower gel I've used in ages, I had to track down the boutique when we got to Osaka to get some!) The bathroom also had a full-service bidet toilet and plenty of room to store your toiletries around the sink. The staff were helpful with recommendations for places to go and to eat. On my daughter's 2nd birthday, we came back to our room to find a birthday gift for her on the table: a card and a cute little Hello Kitty purse that she was so excited about - completely unexpected and such a sweet thing for them to do on her special day. The location was perfect for our family because everything was in close walking distance, including the convenient Asakusa subway line and the famous Nakamise-dōri market (great for souvenirs!) There's also a bank/ATM, supermarket and Starbucks on the same block. The only negative was the hotel breakfast which was sub par compared to other hotels we've stayed at. The options are very limited (only four à la carte options on the menu) and the portion sizes were quite small. The buffet that was included as part of the breakfast had a _very_ limited number of Japanese-style breakfast dishes. We only had breakfast at the hotel once as a result, but it's hardly a deal breaker as we had so much to do during our trip and looked for outside breakfast options anyway. There is also no room service available. Overall, we were extremely happy during our stay and we'd gladly stay at the Gate Hotel again!","Melbourne, Australia","sonieee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",48,5.0

One oversight (and they are not unusual in this, but I will mention it in every hotel review I do)- no shaving/makeup mirror! This could be an easy fix, I hope they heed this review!

We are 2 adults and 2 kids (10 and 5 years old) so it's rare a hotel could accommodate all of us in the existing bed but this hotel is an exception. The essential room (make sure you book the holywood twin room so the beds are put together side by side) has 2 single beds (120cm width) so it's okay for us to sleep altogether. The mattress are comfy -- not as hard as other hotels we stay. Location wise is superb, very near to Gate Kaminarimon and the metro station, a lot of shops nearby so foods are not a problem. We stayed at Shinjuku area after this hotel and regret since this hotel's location and ambience is far better. We even got free breakfast (complimentary) as it is our anniversary, really appreciate it. Breakfast is provided with 3 optional menu to choose from (eggs benedict / curry rice / french toast) but juice and cereal and fruit is provided in the buffet table.

Landing at Narita Airport after 7pm (from Brisbane) it is an hour's journey into the city and then on to your hotel. The staff here provided clear instructions on how to manage that journey - we chose the train, alighted at Ueno and took a taxi to the hotel - super easy and no lugging of bags. Superbly situated - close to the Senso-ji temple and Asakusa shopping area, we were able to grab a late-night meal of sushi and tempura, just a few blocks away from the hotel. We were also close by a convenience store for our breakfast [two of us have specific food requirements]. The hotel itself is tucked up in modern tower with a rooftop bar and views of the Tokyo Spire from reception. We walked our feet off around Tokyo but always there was our safe haven to return to. We stayed two nights before taking the Shinkansen to Kanazawa, had the train tickets and mobile wifi delivered to the hotel, not a hitch.

The rooms are clean with a good selection of toiletry items. The beds are comfortable enough however if you don’t like very soft pillows you will struggle! The Restaurant has a nice selection of food, although a little pricey. When ordering meals don’t expect all meals to come out together, it’s seems quite common throughout Japan that when the meals are cooked they come to the table. We had one experience where two others had eaten their meals before the third meal came. Whilst the staff appeared embarrassed the wait time was not explained to us prior to ordering. The staff are also extremely slow at clearing tables. Breakfast was a good selection of cooked eggs, anyway you like them, plus Japanese breakfast foods. A couple of mornings we had to wait for a table so if on time restrictions allow extra if hotel is busy. Lovely roof top bar with a great view of the Sky Tree. If the bar here is not open you can order from the bar downstairs and they will bring the drinks up to you. Here is where we encountered a few issues. Every night there was an issue with our bill and it was quite common to run out of a particular wine. So remember what you order and check the bill. We used the luggage forwarding service from here to Kyoto, (2 night stay in Hakone) an easy process and inexpensive. Our luggage arrived safely to our Kyoto Hotel.Location is great, so close to Sensoji Temple and the subway. Plenty of Restaurants however quite a few close early. We went to a great Japanese BBQ Restaurant right near the River Boat Cruise Office, and of course the walk from here to Asahi Beer Hall for a night cap is only ten minutes, great views. We also travelled the subway to Disneyland from here. Had an early morning start and encountered peak hour on the trains, a little daunting at first but once you get passed being packed like sardines, it’s a good 60 min trip – Asakusa / Ningyocho / Hatchobori / keiyo Line / MaihamaMost of the staff speak reasonable English, enough to get by with, I just feel they could be a little happier in delivering Customer Service.

The rooftop terrace bar and 13th floor lobby offer spectacular views of Tokyo Skytree, as do rooms on higher floors.I also liked the experience of staying in a more ""low-rise"" hotel rather than the high-rise properties I've selected (and enjoyed) on prior trips. It was convenient to be able to hit the ground for sight seeing or run out for a quick errand before bedtime a bit more quickly. What I most appreciated was the staff. From booking to checking out, they were kind and thoughtful. It was surprising to receive a personal phone call from Yuki to reassure my email query regarding my booking after the hotel response by email couldn't get past my security. For those reviewers who have complaints about language barriers or reserve (which is characteristic), maybe try to learn a bit of Japanese before your next trip. Or, do some research on your own. Also, just try to get this level of service in Paris or New York at any price, in any language. Yeah, good luck with that. Breakfast was abundant with Western egg dishes cooked to order as well as a buffet spread. The Eggs Benedict were especially well prepared. And, it's delivered fast, which is great unless you're in Japan just to eat breakfast all day. The location is very convenient with Senso-ji across the street and other attractions like Kappabashi less than 10 minutes by foot. Asakusa station is one block away, with 3 stops to Ueno or 6 stops to Ginza. Both are transfer points to other major subway lines and Shinkansen. Speaking of prices, the hotel is surprisingly affordable. Basic rooms are a bit small so I would encourage visitors to upgrade to a Scenic or Classy room for a bit more space.

This was chosen strictly due to location. Other factors came into my research as usual: cleanliness, safety, and price. Lets start with the obvious. This is an affordable clean hotel that is just a minute from the Asakusa Station on the Ginza Line. It is close to the Asakusa Line which gets you to Haneda airport, NRT airport, and Disney Resorts Tokyo.The hotel check in desk is situation on the 13th floor.

All food services are served through the 13th floor restaurant which is 24/7.Room 5/5: The room itself was very small, but that’s to be expected. It was modern, clean, had plenty of amenities, and the bathroom was very spacious relative to other hotels. The room décor was quite dark on the colour palate as I prefer something brighter, but that’s me simply sharing this info for those that like bright places to stay. The view I had was towards Senso-ji temple, it was beautiful.Location 5/5: Fantastic location. You are across the street to all of the main attractions in Asakusa, minutes away from the train station that takes you to Tokyo Skytree or into central Tokyo, and minutes away from the Senso-ji temple. And I mean less than 10 minutes. The area itself is very safe and has many convenience stores should you ever need a quick meal, snack, or anything at all.Service 4/5: As expected, the service is great. I would like to mentioned that my personal experience wasn’t really wow-ed. They were polite and courteous as all other hotel staff in Japan were, but they were just ‘doing’. I can’t explain it in another word. I didn’t feel the warm fuzzy hospitality as I felt in other hotels. Please note that I have very high expectations of the hospitality from hotels in Japan; therefore, this is why this is still a 4 out of 5 because they were still great.

The bathroom, whilst small, was very thoughtfully designed with an excellent shower with high water pressure, and even a heated mirror so it didn't fog up after you use the shower. The Japanese toilet was fun too. The location couldn't be better, literally across the road from both the Kaminarimon Gate and Senso-ji temple, and the Asakusa subway station on the Asakusa and Ginza lines, providing easy access across the city. There are innumerable restaurants, cafes, coffee shops and takeaways within minutes of the front door. The staff were really friendly and helpful, and even brought us an iron to the room when we asked for one, and a lady went out of her way to sort out a mess of my own making with tickets for the Ghibli Museum. Wifi was fast and worked well. I would recommend this place to anyone coming to Tokyo and planning on staying at a hotel in the mid-range price bracket, and will return here next time I am in Tokyo.

In this respect though we were disappointed since most of them don't open until 10 or even 11 am and also close early at 6 pm, so we were forced to look elsewhere for meals. On one day we chose to eat the Hotel's breakfast and in this we were disappointed again. A meagre buffet breakfast supported by a few à la carte entrées did not really set us up for the day as we had hoped. On a bright note, the bar on the 13th floor has an excellent lady bartender who mixes probably the best Dry Martini we have enjoyed anywhere.

Our review starts well before arriving with friendly and prompt responses from Ayako Ishida to our endless number of pre-planning questions. Advise and instructions were spot-on and we arrived via train from Haneda Intl Airport without a problem (Ayako directed us to the best station exit with an elevator to manage our luggage). We arranged for a portable wifi from PuPuRu which was delivered prior to our arrival and waiting for us in our room. We booked two corner rooms for 8 nights from April 7 to 15 - just in time for the Cherry Blossoms to erupt in the city. Both rooms were large with two twin beds, desk, seating area, TV, wifi, alarm/radio, safe, small closet, refrigerator, tub, shower and yes, one of those crazy electronic toilets. Amenities included Nespresso coffee maker and 4 coffee pods (daily), hot water kettle, cups and supplies; shampoo, conditioner and body wash; and hair shower cap, toothbrush, combs, face wash, hand foam, and pajamas. The rooms have central air conditioning and heating - although we did have to ask for help in setting our systems. Corner rooms have floor to ceiling windows that overlook the Sensoji Temple and we loved the view especially at night. Unlike most USA hotels the lobby, restaurant and bar are located on the top 13th floor with the rooms located below - so the entry is a bit unwelcoming with only elevators. Once you arrive at reception - all of your initial fears quickly melt away. The views are stunning in all directions, finishes are beautiful and reception staff attentive and helpful. Our room rate included breakfast which consisted of menu items (scrambled eggs, over-easy eggs or pancakes) and buffet items (salad, pasta, yogurt, cereal, potatoes and more). They pride themselves with hand-pressed fresh orange juice and honey from freshly harvested bee hives. An outside lounge and bar are upstairs from reception and the views are not to be missed (guest only). The hotel is close to all major systems of transport - trains from the airport, trains to escape the city, metro and subway lines. You can even take a rickshaw to tour the Asakusa precinct. A well stocked grocery store is conveniently located next to the hotel entry if you need any special items or stock up snacks. We loved staying in Asakusa and found it to be a more traditional and quieter part of Tokyo.

We loved our stay and would definitely stay here again. The location is in Asakusa, one block from the Sensoji Temple. We liked this area better than the busier shopping areas of Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Gion. It is a convenient 2 block walk to the Asakusa Station where other areas of Tokyo can be reached easily.We stayed in a 12th floor Classy King Double Room (Style C) with an excellent view of the Tokyo Skytree. You can also see the Kaminarimon Gate, entry to the walking street leading to the Sensoji Temple. The Classy King Double is spacious at 397 sq ft and has a couch in the sitting area.

Both areas have scenic views of Asakusa. All the staff were pleasant, courteous, and spoke good English. We enjoyed the excellent breakfast every morning. You get a choice of one main dish (scrambled eggs, French toast, eggs Benedict, or a curry dish). In addition, there is a breakfast buffet with fresh squeezed orange juice, various breads, salads, cooked vegetables, fruits, cereal, and yogurt.Pros:- Large Style C Classy King Double room: modern and tastefully decorated- View from our room and lobby on 12th floor of Tokyo Skytree and Kaminarimon Gate- Staff provided excellent service- Perfect neighborhood in older and quieter Asakusa- Conveniently located: 1 block to Sensoji Temple, 2 blocks to Asakusa Station, 1/2 block to food market, many restaurants nearby- Good breakfast buffet with choice of main dish- Small in-room refrigerator- 2 complementary bottles of water every dayCons:- Internet can get very slow during morning and evening busy hours. At times it was unusable so we used our Mi-Fi instead.Tips:- Food market almost directly downstairs from the hotel for fresh fruits- Breakfast starts at 6:30am. Go at this time before the tour groups arrive.- When taking the metro at Asakusa Station, use Exit 1, the closest to the hotel- If your budget allows, pay extra for a larger room on a higher floor- From Haneda airport, take the easy Keikyu train directly to Asakusa Station.

I am so glad that we choose this hotel. If you want direct access to the shopping malls etc this isn't for you. But if you want peace and quiet and an amazing view choose the Gate Hotel with a Tokyo Tower view. The view is really worth the extra money, it was amazing to watch the skyline in a thunder storm and see the city waking up in the mornings. The subway is within a 5 minute walk and it was easy to access all areas of the city. Shibuya is about 40 mins on the subway. It was also great to be able to see this older part of the city at night with no other tourists. We departed from Tokyo Narita Airport and we got a cab to Uneo Keisei station and then a direct train to Narita, The cab dropped us at the back of the station so no heaving of heavy luggage required and it was on one level at the other end. Just as an aside we stayed the night in Narita which is a really lovely town with a beautiful temple (larger, more beautiful and a lot quieter than Tokyo).We ate outside of the hotel and there is masses to choose from traditional sweets (always a queue for that shop) to Burger King in walking distance. There is also a great supermarket on the ground floor. It plays western music on loop including Sam Fox I want to feel your body, took me right back to the 80s.Rooms are dark wood and modern with very comfortable beds and the best shower I have ever experienced. There was also a small seating area with a comfy sofa. The reception is on the top floor with a bar and restaurant and then a viewing place a little higher. To access your room you use your key card and then it lets you out at that floor, added security. Staff spoke good English and were really helpful.

Tokyo was our first stop and after a long haul flight required we required a very comfortable hotel to stay in for a few days to recover & then sight-see. We read the reviews and the Gate Hotel seemed the perfect place to stay.We were not disappointed. This is a refurbished, modern hotel with spacious rooms ( a rarity in Tokyo), large, well equipped bathrooms and very comfortable beds. The reception area is actually on the highest point of the hotel ( the 14th floor I seem to remember) so do not be confused when checking in! Once reception is reached the views are spectacular- wall to ceiling glass, with beautiful views across the Tokyo skyline and, in particular, the Tokyo Sky Tree which looms large.The restaurant and bar are on the same level- wonderful views and also, excellent quality food that, for a hotel, was not overpriced. A great way to end a day of sightseeing- a glass of Sake while absorbing views over Tokyo. Also, there is a ' residents only' bar one floor up- a very small area but with outdoor viewing platforms ( easy on the Sake!).The staff were wonderful- no exceptions. In particular, the receptionists were incredibly helpful & most courteous and the bar staff were extremely friendly & professional. All staff should be mentioned though- they made us feel so welcome in a rather different culture than we have been used to.I should also mention location- Asakusa is a great place to stay - it is one of the oldest districts of Tokyo, home of several temples , including the beautiful Senso-Ji Buddhist temple. It really is 'old' Japan, away from the rather brash, bright lights of Tokyo central. Subways are very nearby, very convenient. The Sky Tree is an easy 2 stop ride away. Plenty of very good, local restaurants. A couple of tips, head to the Temples prior to around 10am ( just a few minutes walk). We noticed large tour groups arriving after that time & the whole temple area gets very crowded. Also, request a higher level hotel room - it looks like views will be blocked by lower rooms.A wonderful hotel, incredibly comfortable with a great location.

Couple of minutes walk from historic part of Tokyo, fascinating temples, street life and excellent, well-priced local restaurants. Easy commute to all the touristy spots.The two things that made this a five-star stay for us occurred at the start and end of our stay and were in fact outside of the hotel's responsibility - not that they seemed to mind.So, we arrived after a 12 hour flight, and I was tired and grumpy about having been ripped off by my taxi driver (we needed two taxis to accommodate our family of five). I may have been tired and new to the currency but when you give someone 10,000 whatevers to pay for a ride that costs 1200 whatevers you can work out what your change should look like! My driver shortchanged me 5000 Y - around $US45 or $4 NZ million (kidding). Anyway, I tried arguing with the driver three times but I didn't speak Japanese, he didn't speak English and he insisted that the change he gave me correct.Turned up to reception, they started checking us in and I said: ""Look I'm sorry to interrupt but can you check my change because I'm pretty sure the driver didn't give me the correct change."" She checked my receipt, my change, and confirmed that I had been short-changed 5000 yen. She excused herself, returned a few minutes later to inform me that she had spoken to someone at the taxi company who had spoken to the driver, who said that I gave him only 5000 yen. My heart sank. I was tired, I had travelled far. Perhaps I had made a mistake. Then my kids saved me. ""No way!!! You gave him 10,000 mum!"" My husband confirmed that he had only received 10,000 Y notes from the cash machine. OK. The receptionist informed us that all taxis have a camera. Would we like the company to check the camera? Yes we would. We finished our check-in, grabbed a meal and a very comfortable sleep and the next morning we were greeted with an envelope at reception containing our 5000 Y and an apology from the taxi driver, who had ""made a mistake"". Not bad huh?So, three wonderful days later we left Tokyo after a very comfortable stay thinking that we would definitely return to this hotel - not realising we had left half our stuff behind! We arrived in Germany to discover that our youngest boys' snow boots and another pair of shoes had been left in the hotel room. Expensive and annoying. I emailed the hotel and asked them to courier them to us in Europe and bill us for the cost. They did so immediately but insisted that they would meet the cost. The boots arrived a couple of days later.A mishap with a taxi and being careless about leaving stuff behind - neither of these things were the responsibility of the Gate Hotel but they took a service approach to their clients and really looked after us. Thank you so much!I must add that I have NEVER heard of anyone being ripped off in Japan - Tokyo feels safer than any major international city I have ever visited.

Normally on business you stay in the city centre generally in tiny functional rooms three minutes from the office. 'Well, yes' I reply. I am in a traditional part of the City In a hotel situated opposite beautiful temples with unparalleled views from its lobby bar terrace and room and moreover it only takes me 15 minutes on the smoothly running Asakusa line to the city centre. I stumbled open this hidden gem of a hotel whilst comparing traditional options. It was tagged as a boutique hotel a title I'm normally wary of as it has been misused over the years. I'm glad I booked as it really is a boutique hotel and priced very reasonably. There is a train line from the airport that takes you to the nearest station literally three minutes away from the hotel. On the way to the hotel you pass the temple and also a tourist information centre. The hotel entrance is understated and elegant you could easily miss it. Subtle rippling water effects are projected on the entrance walls. The lobby bar terrace and restaurant are on the 13/14 floors with similar light displays and art works. The lift goes directly to those floors so non guests can visit the restaurant and sample the views. Once you have your room card you can go directly from the ground floor to your room without the normal arrangement of access through the lobby. A great arrangement that gives you the feeling of having your own apartment and privacy. The room I stayed in was a twin it was the only one available. A good size with everything thought through in design terms. They even provide an ioniser. The single bed was large and the mattress sumptuous. Lovely Pyjamas beautiful bathroom products including large bottles of quality shampoo and conditioner, tooth brushes and sundries. The feeling of generosity is the hallmark of this place. The understated atmosphere a sign of a confidence after five years of opening the know a guests needs will be met. Breakfast is served to jazz, Astrud Gilberto a favourite. The buffet includes a honeycomb dripping fresh honey fresh marmalade made on the premises and a Lady squeezing fresh orange juice. There is an assortment of vegetables and pasta and freshly baked mini croissants and raisin bread. Butter on the table is from France. The restaurant is open 24/7 and a welcome retreat after a busy work day. The food is excellent and inspired by French cuisine, once again finely prepared with great attention to detail. It is guaranteed quality and I must admit I have been a little bit lazy in sampling outside restaurants due to the assurance of what I order will be great. The roof terrace has great views and a nice place to sit with a cocktail wrapped in a blanket for the January cold. The bar is only accessible to guests also has great views and is a warm intimate space unfortunately smoking inside has not been banned in Japan and it can occasionally be overwhelming for the non smoker. My night cap generally is taken in the restaurant bar with a Cosmo expertly prepared and packing a real punch by Riki Warigai who has been here since the hotel opened. She makes me feel very welcome and chats with me about my days activities. Nice when you are a women in business and alone. Nothing is too much for the staff who after a few days predict what I am going to order and smile warmly as they serve. They all wear subtly tucked away ear pieces so I suspect there is a real organised approach underlying everything. Front of house at reception are helpful if a little shy. It's the weekend now and there are many people waiting for brunch- a testimony to the place. I look forward to walking around the City knowing that I have my little oasis hideaway to come back to at the end of the day.

The hotel is located about a block or two from Sensō-ji (Kaminarimon) and the Asakusa station for the Tokyo metro. This allowed easy access to stops like Akihabara and Tsukiji, as well as an almost direct route to Tokyo station. It's also worth noting that you can ride directly from Haneda Airport to Asakusa without needing to switch trains, which is good news for tired travelers with late arrival times.The restaurant was quite frankly one of the best dining experiences I've had at a hotel. I grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered an excellent beef cheek braised in red wine sauce, following up my meal with a bit of sake from the well-stocked bar. In addition to being able to watch the bartender prepare ice for other customers drinks, I had the pleasure of listening to a spectacularly talented pianist/singer playing during a good portion of my time there.For breakfast I returned to the restaurant for some eggs benedict.

We were in Tokyo for only a few days and wanted somewhere central, close to the airports (both Haneda and Narita), and a place that made us feel at home in a unique neighborhood but still had an “it” factor, luxury vibe, and was unique and well-placed enough to make a 2-day stay effortless and worthwhile. We found that The Gate Hotel.As a member of the Design Hotels group, The Gate has its own look and feel, simplistic but design-oriented from lobby to bedroom — from the entrance, with the water-reflected light effects, to the “egg” in the room, to the incredible lobby views. Oh yes, the lobby – what a view. The highlight of the hotel, in our view, is the chic lobby with its long elegant sofas and wide view over Asakusa, and Japan looking towards the Sky Tree tower. You’ll want to hang out here at least once. We loved the understated exterior look of the hotel – at one point, returning in the evening after a walk through Asakusa shopping district, we gazed down the street searching for our hotel and realized we were standing right in front of it!Located in Asakusa area, a great locale, quiet enough but right in a vibrant neighborhood and well connected to everywhere else. Located in the humble but busy Asakusa neighborhood, near the Kaminarimon Gate leading to Sensoji Temple (a must-visit temple in the city), with an area full of shopping and restaurants, and near some cool attractions like Kirin Beer’s headquarters, the Tokyo Skytree (views of which were spectacular from the hotel), and close to a water ferry stop.The rooms are simple but smartly designed; I loved the Nespresso machine, comfortable beds, the futuristic toilet, amazing toiletries (loving the toothbrush to this day), and a really nice shower made for a luxurious and comfortable feel. Some rooms had a view to the Tokyo Skytree and the surrounding area. The room had enough space for the two of us with plenty of luggage, unlike some tiny spaces in Tokyo.We loved the 14th-floor private bar with terrace (only open to hotel guests and their guests), which offered a great view both day and night. There is an outside seating area, complete with heaters for cold days, and an inside bar (I must say, the bartender must’ve been quite bored as we didn’t see any people up here). There is a restaurant in the hotel, offering all meals. We didn’t try the restaurant for lunch or dinner, but it was open 24-7 (to guests) and the breakfast, although rather pricey, was very nice (although very Western!). I thought the Curry Eggs Benedict was sensational and I had to have it two mornings in a row; accompanying buffet offerings were good, but the honey display was a sweet sight to see. Breakfast is expensive (¥2,160, about $25 CAD) but worth trying once.In summary, we really liked the design and modern feel, the location and transport/ airport links, the view from the 13th-floor lobby, and the 14th private bar (only open to hotel guests, thus probably empty) and terrace with great views. We loved the vibe in the area, shopping and eating in the Asakusa area, walking around the temples and the old-style Tokyo neighborhood. The hotel is not a budget option but isn’t overly expensive for Tokyo either (likely due to its location which is considered on the outskirts of Tokyo, but still well connected, in our opinion), running around $200-$250 per night (CAD).

The location in an older part of the city, close to subway lines and great food and other shopping was on your doorstep. But what made our stay even better was the fantastic staff who were some of the best we have ever encountered.Booked easily on their website (English version) and requested a Class C style room as it had the better view and looked to be a little larger than the other rooms. We asked for a floor higher up and were given a great room on the 10th floor.Unlike most hotels the reception of the hotel is on the top floor (ie 13th) and then all the rooms are on the floors underneath. This means you come out of the lift and walk straight into an area that has a fantastic view of the city around Askakusa including the Sensoji Temple and Skytree tower.HINT: If you are getting a taxi to the hotel and they use Google maps to find the hotel it might take them down a side street to the main street the hotel is on…at the intersection if you have a supermarket on your LHS then ask the taxi pull up in the space just past the supermarket and you will be out front of the Gate Hotel. The Hotel is in a building that doesn’t look like a hotel so it can be a little tricky to find at first.We knew there was an additional cost to check in early (clearly explained on the website and in the follow-up emails from the Hotel) so we arrived right on check in time of 2pm. It was one of the best check in experiences we have ever had with all our questions answered and the staff were so helpful.The room was ready so we went straight there. The rooms and hallways are in in a sombre colours with slashes of colour like the beautiful blue door of the lift.The room was modern, clean, and quiet and a very decent size considering Japan standards. We needed to have our suitcases open on the floor as there was limited storage space…however we would prefer to have the little sitting area by the window in preference to extra wardrobes etc. We could sit here (and open the window a little) for a drink and see the Sky Tree Tower light up and hear the local street noises.The bathroom had a separate shower room with a deep bath and there is a window with a view. Plenty of plugs for charging and a Nespresso coffee machine in the room. There was also beer in the vending machine and free ice just down the hall.On the rooftop (above the reception) there was a fantastic view and bar. We were lucky the first night it was warm and happy hour (I think between 3 and 6pm) was still happening. We didn’t need to go to the Skytower to see the view we had it right there in the Hotel.The location is really good to explore this side of Tokyo. When we first arrived in Japan we stayed three nights in Shinjuku and explored the area around there, travelled by train to Kanazawa, Takeyama and Kyoto and then back to Tokyo. We wanted to stay in a totally different area to the very modern Shinjuku and Asakusa (and the Gate Hotel) were perfect. Also from Asakusa you have direct access to both airports Narita and Haneda. We left to Narita airport via the nearby Asakusa station and the Hotel staff directed us to the only entrance that has an elevator. It took us less than an hour to get to the airport including a short walk from Terminal 2 (where the train come in) to Terminal 3 were our flight was. The ticket cost about 1200 yen (approx. AUS$15.00) and therefore was a lot cheaper than the Express Limo we come in on when we arrived in Tokyo.We had full breakfast in the Hotel on the last day as easier since we had to leave early. Not too bad and the views were great.Two other highlights of our stay in the Askakusa area were Kappabashi (kitchen street) which was about 10 mins walk away. We bought some great knives here and a sake bottle. The other was dinner at the Tonkatsu restaurant “Yutaka”. Ask the Hotel staff how to get there …it is only a few minutes’ walk. We found out about it via a review on Trip Adviser “Hidden in one of the smaller streets perpendicular to the road where the famous Kaminarimon Gate to Senso-ji Temple is situated. (We found it crossing the street from The Gate Hotel, walk to 2nd street west direction, then turn right and its past the first intersection on the left...EASY). This tonkatsu house has been operating for over 60 years! (it opened just after WWII) Their tonkatsu are made of tender Yamato pork from Gunma, deep-fried in batter made of homemade flour using high quality cottonseed oil.”We tried both the tenderloin fillet and the pork loin (described on the English menu as fatty cut of pork) and both preferred the less fatty tenderloin. Just note that this place closes at 8.30pm so don’t be late or you will miss out on one of the best eating experiences in Tokyo.The only thing we can suggest to the Hotel as an improvement is to have the air-conditioning instructions in English (Climate Control system is in Japanese only). However a call to reception and a lovely woman was down in no time to show us how it all worked.We will certainly stay at The Gate Hotel again.",Australia,"AustraliaMaree</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",49,5.0

I found the lighting in the room was inadequate. I had to use my torch to read the display on the control panel of the air conditioner. However it did not bother me too much. In general I really like the room.There was a laundry press in the room but no iron. The laundry press would be good for trousers and suits, but could not be used for delicate dresses. I found this very inconvenient. Therefore, ladies better pack dresses that don't need to be iron with you. I'm not sure if the hotel had laundry service as I could not find any information in the room. The breakfast at the hotel is quite boring. They keep serving me fried potato wedges with breakfast. That didn't make sense. There weren't many choice of food. I think it is a bit disappointing when a Japanese hotel didn't serve Japanese or Asian breakfast. There weren't many choices either. I could no longer eat their breakfast on the last day of my stay (even though it was included in my package) because the food was so boring.

It is not a large buffet but had freshly squeezed orange juice, granola, yogurt, potatoes, vegetables, some local foods, 1 or 2 fruits and bread/butter/jam.Location - it felt very safe, both the neighborhood and the hotel since the elevators are in a nondescript building lobby and you need a room key to get to the room floors.

We stayed in a ""Scenic"" room on the 10th floor. Staff: The staff at this hotel are first rate. They are friendly, spoke good English and were extremely attentive. I had the impression that they went out of their way to make the customer feel important. Room: We were in room 1004 (Scenic Room) with twin beds. The room faced the Skytree tower and had a nice view of this part of the city. The windows were big and it made the room feel very bright. The room itself was not huge compared to North American standards but quite big compared to most Japanese hotels I have stayed in. It was very clean, had good lighting, a fridge, writing desk and sitting area. We stayed in Tokyo when the temperature hovered near 34C each day. The air conditioning in our room had no trouble keeping the room cool.Food and Drink: We had breakfast included with our room. The breakfast included a choice of four entrees (eggs benedict, french toast), a small buffet and coffee/juices. Although others have indicated the breakfast was not that great I thought it provided the best breakfasts I had in Japan. The food was always hot, the service was friendly and fairly quick and the view was great. There is also a roomtop bar that has a great view and is a pleasant way to end off your day.Location: The hotel is located a couple of blocks from the Asakusa metro station. We basically followed the directions posted on the website and had no trouble getting there (at night) from the Narita airport. It takes just over an hour. The hotel is very close to numerous shrines/temples and a large shopping area. The metro gets you to other areas of Tokyo easily.Overall this was a great hotel with great staff. Highly recommended.","London, Canada","To_Far_From_Paradise</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, Canada</strong>",53,5.0

It is also conveniently located across from Asakusa station and Ginza line station, and 2 blocks away from Starbucks and good tempura restaurants.

I called the hotel to just double check if I really left it in the room, which they confirmed I did. So I gave no instructions and I just said I'll call back. Next day, I received an email from the wifi rental company that they will not charge me $54 for the lost item since my hotel shipped it to them, and I am just soooo shocked and really appreciate how the staff of Gate Hotel truly cares about their customers, not just while their checked in, but also when they are no longer a guest.

Solo travel.There are many things different with hotel culture in Japan and there are many rules and do's and dont's. It is good to know and you are expected follow it strictly so you wont be embarrased.1) Check-in and check-out times:- there is strictly NO early check-in and strictly NO late check-out without any surcharge. And do take note that the surcharge is extremely expensive which usually culculated by hourly.2) Room rates are culculated per head. If there is an extra person, you are expected to pay the extra, which in most hotel you have to get another room. Therefore, it is very common in Japan, there are rooms cater exclusively for only one person, like this one I am staying.3) All hotels in Japan do have Smooking rooms on Smoking floors. Therefore, when making a reservation, do ensure (I really meant this!) whether your rooms are smoking room or otherwise. If you are a non-smoker like me, I am sure you dont want to regret over your stupidness to not check your room type.ROOM - As mentioned, this is my first time staying at a room exclusively for one person. All I can say, I am amazed! The room size is pretty decent for a Japan standard with good size of bathroom. There is two type of room of this type, mine is the one with long corridor from the entrance door (see picture of floor plan if you may). The reason I mention this is because this room feels and looks bigger. LOCATION - A short 10 minutes walk from Asakusa subway station. In front of the Asakusa Shrine, major tourist spot in Tokyo. Surrounding with many restaurants, shops, and convenience stores.This hotel is newly built. You can see and feel it is new.

The others have all been amazing, with that special Japanese service, and this one was no different.It started out a little wonky, as I realized I only booked for one person under my name, and I was travelling with my husband. They handled it like pros, and never once gave me the feeling that they were blaming me, or annoyed at my mistake. I only had to pay extra for the extra person's breakfast, which was inclusive with my existing booking.The room is not spectacular, but the view is, especially from their bird's eye view lobby and hotel restaurant. You can check my pictures. The breakfast buffet is yummy, with just enough choices for a long day. Everywhere you go the staff are friendly and eager to help.But what really left an impression on me was what happened after my stay. I left my wedding ring on the countertop when we were hauling all our luggages out, and from my experience in other hotels, if it's gone, it's gone. I only realized it was gone when we were about to board the plane, so I sent a quick email and reminded myself to call later, since emails take longer to reach them. Not Gate Hotel though, by the time I was in Macau, the spectacular Ayako Ishida had replied to me, and sent me a picture of the ring and asked for my address.I offered to pay the cost of shipping, but they wouldn't hear of it and shipped it for free. I received my ring via express mail after a week with a note thanking me for my stay, when I should be thanking them for this service.I will definitely stay at this hotel again during my next Tokyo trip, and I highly recommend it to anyone going to Tokyo.PROS:Amazing view in lobby and restaurant - 10/10Polite, Professional and spectacular staff, who go beyond the usual guest dutiesGreat location - if you're planning to go to the airport via metro, Asakusa is one of the two areas with the direct train.

As we had stayed in Shinagawa during our first Tokyo stint, we opted for this hotel in Asakusa, due to the many positive reviews on Tripadvisor. The hotel is situated roughly 4 minutes by foot from the Senso-ji exit of the Asakusa Metro station, and stands diagonally opposite the entrance to the Nakamise-dori/Kaminarimon. Of particular note is the ease of access to the station, and the proximity to Senso-ji. The area features a whole host of excellent and reasonably priced restaurants and places to explore on the same street as the hotel, as well as in the precinct directly opposite the hotel. Asakusa is a destination in itself, and this hotel is a fantastic location to explore from.The hotel lobby is located on the top floor, so the ground floor consists of just an entrance corridor to the elevators. The reception area is very nice, if not a little understated, with a large lounge overlooking Asakusa and the Skytree. The restaurant is also located on this level, and it is very busy. Whenever we were in the reception area, day or night, the restaurant was always full. On that basis, I would suggest you get reservations if you intend to eat there. Check-in was simple and efficient, and we went to our room on the 6th floor. Having had our luggage sent on by takkyubin previously, it was nice to have our luggage waiting in our room when we arrived. As the hotel fronts on to the main street in Asakusa, I would recommend getting a room to the side of the hotel, which faces a sidestreet and has a nice view of the skytree. As a result, it is very protected from street noise. Complementary wifi access was offered, but as we had a portable router, we did not use the service.Our room was lacking in space in terms of the living area, despite having just one large bed (which was two doubles pushed together). This made getting around the room a little difficult, considering there was not much room for the couch and table and working space at the desk. The room was very dark and appeared to be a mish-mash of various styles, with post-modern, classic and industrial designs all clashing and not really giving coherence to the feeling of the room. On our first day we noted that the room was quite dusty, but was gradually cleaned out as our stay went on. The rooms were well kept, with the staff organising our items we had casually left on the floor in our hurry to leave most mornings. The bathroom size was quite generous, with a separate tub and shower, and the amenities were better than expected. One thing I noticed was significant noise coming from other rooms - to the side and the room above us, with heavy stamping and children running through the corridor.Due to our busy schedule in Tokyo, we were unable to try the restaurant, but we did venture to the sky garden, which has one of the best views in all of Tokyo. There's an intimate restaurant near the sky garden, which also has an immaculate view, but we were unable to score a seat. Service was generally good, and I must thank the staff for allowing us use of a laptop to check in to our flights before we departed.Overall, our stay was quite pleasant, and I would easily recommend this hotel to those seeking a stay in the Asakusa area. In terms of the price point, I would say the hotel just scrapes by on the right side of value for money.","Canberra, Australia","aandsaustralia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",107,4.0

My husband and I are relatively frequent travelers, who have visited at least a couple dozen countries around the World, making four to five international trips per year. I confess that through our quarter of a century experience as travelers we have not seen management services comparable to the ones provided by The Gate Hotel Asakusa.  The hotel is perfectly located in the Tokyo area we have loved the most- Asakusa. The windows of the hotel are overlooking both Tokyo’s oldest Senso-ji temple, founded in the seventh century, and the twenty first century Tokyo Skytree, the tallest tower in Japan and the second tallest building in the world. The location couldn’t be more unique than this, as you can enjoy the view of both from the window of your room. There was one additional consideration about why we selected this particular hotel for our recent stay, mid-May 2016, in Tokyo. The Gate Hotel belongs to the group of Design Hotels, in which we have stayed a few times around the world. We found from our own experience that this group of hotels has a distinct commitment to placing hotels in great locations, providing somewhat ascetic yet very comfortable rather than excessively luxurious experiences, and delivering impeccable and “non-invasive” management services. In particular, we enjoyed our visit to The Louis Hotel in Munich, Germany, and anticipated that the experience of staying at The Gate Hotel, Asakusa will be somewhat similar, or perhaps better, given the environmental conscious and ascetic nature of Japanese culture. We found this expectation to be fully true. In this sense of management’s “non-invasiveness” we found The Gate Hotel Asakusa at the best of this philosophy. Instead of a minibar with overpriced items they provide travelers with a comfortable living environment including a refrigerator, coffee machine, tea and glassware sets and great advice on grocery shops located on ground floor of the hotel, where you can get sushi and wine for $5-10 each, or a small exceptional place where one can leave $500 for two. Whatever you ask The Gate Hotel management, you will get honest advice without any attempts to sell the tourists any services they do not need. In addition to the breath taking views from all our windows, impeccable cleanness, everyday vacuuming and wet wiping of windows, mirrors, etc. there always have been exemplary politeness from the hotel staff. An unfortunate accident happened to us, when we visiting Senso-ji temple; I wanted to touch the “Giant Straw Sandals"" there, because of the legend that “they are charms from evil” and if one does touch it, then one will became a tireless walker. My husband lifted me to reach the height of the “giant sandal” and touch it, but when he was putting me back on the ground, I hurt my foot. It was so serious that I could barely walk back to The Gate Hotel – I was sobbing from pain. In a few hours it became clear that I needed professional medical help.  We contacted The Gate Hotel Management and they immediately arranged our transportation to the University of Tokyo Medical Center. Masami Kawagoe took care about all logistics, translations (Japanese to English and back) and hospital emergency room issues. Luckily, no bones were broken in the foot, but a serious torn tendon was detected. We spent hours in the ER of University of Tokyo medical center instead of at a Sumo wrestling match, which we had originally planned for the evening and for which we had bought tickets a much in advance. By about 8pm we were back to The Gate Hotel and it was clear that we had to either terminate our planned remaining week traveling Japan (including Kyoto and Miyajima Island), or find a way to rent a wheelchair in the next eight hours – I at this point couldn’t walk at all. The healing process could be two or three months. Masami Kawagoe discussed this problem with the hotel management and the hotel’s management came with the proposal that they would give us (at no cost) the hotel wheelchair to let us continue our travel in Japan, and later the hotel staff would come to the train station in the Tokyo region to collect the wheelchair when we would be traveling back to the Narita/Tokyo airport on our way back to Los Angeles. This kindest gesture of The Gate Hotel Management saved our travel arrangements and our remaining wonderful visit to Japan. What is most incredible is that all these arrangements to mitigate our unfortunate travel accident were done based on a “gentlemen’s” agreement established on just a word, and on honoring such a word, with no formal signatures or legalities. To conclude, we wanted to thank The Gate hotel management, and particularly Masami Kawagoe for the assistance provided during our troubled travel. We are looking forward for our next visit to Tokyo, and the choice of The Gate Hotel for our stay has been decided. It is one of kind hotel.

It’s my first trip to Tokyo and I wanted to only stay in ONE hotel throughout instead of shuttling to and fro. I think it was a great choice to do so because shuttling around the busy and crowded trains, via stairs to the subway, would not be a very pleasant encounter.Gate Hotel was great for us. We chose a Hollywood Twin room with no breakfast – no breakfast because we wanted to explore the area for options and well, we read mixed reviews about hotel breakfast. We also didn’t have the need to “load up” before going out since we’re trying to cut down on calories (haha) so no buffet for us.NEARBY BREAKFAST OPTIONS – we did find a few really nice cafes around the ‘hood. (1) KOHIKAN served up 100-300yen breakfast sets if you purchased a drink (usually +/-500yen).It’s just across the street to the left (once you walk out of the hotel) after the Family Mart. Barely 5 minutes walk. Served up the best charcoal coffee and crispy & fluffy pancakes. Pancakes were such a hit with my girl we were there 5-6 days out of our 10. (2) E PRONTO is slightly harder to spot unless you’ve come up from this particular Asakusa train exit. It’s on a small road opposite the Kaminarimon. Loads o f choices of pastries or toast sets. Great place to stop by if you’re on the way to the train station. ROOM – The room was adequate for the three of us. We had two super singles which we joined to sleep together. We got our request of a relatively high floor (9th floor) and facing the Tokyo Skytree. It was quite lovely. Room was cleaned everyday with option to change sheets. Pyjamas were also provided – which came in SO USEFUL because in my packing frenzy, I forgot to bring PJs! PJs could also be changed everyday if you wished to but we mostly wore it at least twice since it’d be such a waste.TOILET/BATH – Room came with toilet, and a separate steam-proof area for shower and bathtub.

It's right smack in the centre of Asakusa. The Sensoji Temple is very near to the hotel, with the main gate and Nakamise shopping street less than a minute's walk away. Tokyo Skytree is also in the vicinity. There are lots of eateries and restaurants around the hotel, so you are never short of choices. There is a local supermarket beside the hotel entrance that should be able to serve your daily needs.Granted it's not in Tokyo centre, but given their very reliable and well connected subway system, you are never very far off from any attractions. The subway station, served by 2 different lines, is also a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. If you are traveling to Ginza or Shibuya (or is it Shinjuku), you don't even have to change lines. Having mentioned how great the location is, I would be doing the hotel injustice if the other great things about the hotel is not highlighted. Checkin and checkout was fast and straightforward. The staff speak decent and understandable English. The room itself was clean and well equipped. Sound proofing was good and we hardly heard anything from the corridor. During our stay, there was unfortunately no more non smoking rooms, hence the staff suggested to deodorize the room for us, which we thought was proactive and a nice touch. Even before booking with the hotel, the hotel reservation staff was very prompt and helpful with the enquiries we had. If I have to nitpick, I would say the room though complete, is a bit small.Overall, a great hotel in a peaceful and less hectic area of Tokyo.

I guess my expectations were high because it did not meet what some of the reviews I read online when I stayed in this hotel. I want to give honest opinions so here : rooms are overpriced- this hotel is below average business type room with tiny bed, tiny shower room and for the price there was no bath tub. Paid $180.00 for a night. The tv is set or placed on the side of the wall and you can't move it to left or right. It's in one position so you have to deal with it to be in that position if you want to watch tv . Amenities are poor nothing fancy. The breakfast buffet are okay nothing special. The lobby is average and the nice thing is that you can see the sky tree tower in front of you from the glass window. But honestly you can just go outside and you'd still see that view so there's no need to stay in this hotel for that. I don't know what it is but it's really hard to find a nice hotel in Japan especially for the price you pay which is not cheap. The staff of the hotels are annoying at times especially the women in the front desk. The middle aged men who works at night was helpful. But the women sounded arrogant and impatient to answer some of our queries. Sadly, I can't recommend this hotel. Nothing special to be honest.

I came across one hotel that impressed me - The Gate Hotel. I then of course visited their actual website and was even more impressed with what I saw there.The rooms looked clean and divine. The beds big and fluffy - you know, the ones that make it really hard to get out of because of how comfy they are? The pristine cleanliness and modernity of the toilet and bathroom was impressive - what sold me was the ""rain dance shower"". I was all like öooooh, fancy"".Of course the hotel was shortlisted on my Ïf I ever bloody make it to Japan, these are the places I want to stay in"" list.Fast forward to 2015 and I'm spontaneously booking flights to Japan! And of course I haven't forgotten about my shortlist.I was travelling with friends and we agreed that during our stay, we would first live on the cheap aka stay in a hostel and later rent an apartment via AirBnB (both turned out to be swanky af for really cheap prices), and then live in luxury during our last few days in Tokyo, The Gate Hotel being the luxurious choice.Now this is where the review actually starts...sorry about the long winding monologue.The Hotel is located smack dab in the bustling part of Asakusa, right across from Sensoji Temple Gates.You walk into the lobby area which smells so bloody amazing! The ceiling of the lobby is another thing you cannot miss since it looks like you're standing under a glass bottom pool!From here you'll catch the elevator up to the 13th floor since this is where the Reception area is located. As soon as those doors open - BAM - your eyeballs are hit with the view of Asakusa! Your Reception desk and friendly staff are located to the right of you but damn, you'll be in awe of the view. But once you snap out of your trance, head straight to Reception desk and you'll be greeted by a friendly and helpful staff member.Learning from past experience (look out for my review on Hotel Richmond Premier) and to also time it perfectly with catching our flight, I had asked for a late check out at 2pm. After a few minutes (I spent it admiring the view of Asakusa), the staff member was able to allow me to check out at 3 for a small price. After that information exchange he then went on to inform us of the important stuff such as the location of the bar (you have to walk up short flight of stars to the 14th floor), dining was 24hrs and they had breakfast buffet.Once he handed our access cards, we made our way with our heavy as bags and big as winter coats into the elevator and hit button number 10.Once we waddled into our rooms, we did what most travelers do - inspected our room.It was spacious. It was clean. It was impressive. It was comfy. It had everything that we needed.The beds were big AND comfy AND perfect. The bathroom area was spacious and clean and spotless. The shower was huge - to me it was huge and I'm not a skinny person. It did have your traditional Japanese bathtub (the deep kind) but unfortunately I didn't bathe in that. Next time I will though.After braving the cold and exploring Asakusa, we made it back to our hotel and decided to treat ourselves and have dinner at the hotel's restaurant. The pricing is the same amount as when you go out for dinner here in Australia. We treated ourselves which meant ordering entree's, mains and desserts...and alcoholic beverages (Cassis soda my friends, it's like drinking Ribena but for adults).I can't remember the entree that I ordered but it was yummy. The main dish though, now that is something I am impressed by. I ordered the wagyu main which I think cost around 40 or 4500 yen. AMAZING! So delicious and buttery and perfect! I wasn't in love with my dessert - creme brulee - I thought it was bordering more towards custard but meh, I should've ordered the french toast instead since that looked joygasmic.After our meals, we had the smart idea to waddle and make our way to the 14th floor where the bar was located. The inside bar area is small and intimate but you're able to head out onto the rooftop balcony and enjoy your drinks there while gazing out at the awesome views of nighttime Asakusa. They thankfully provide heaters outside since it is quite nippy during winter.After all this we agreed to have breakfast the next day at the hotel and we soon bid each other night night after making our way back to our rooms.Come morning time we are at the breakfast buffet area, having a good looksee at what the hotel had to offer. It's not your traditional breakkie buffet where you get an endless amount of bacon and eggs and sausages and mushrooms. Instead you order a main, the options being eggs bene, french toast or the usual bacon and eggs, I think? And from here, you then make your way to the buffet area where you're able to drink freshly squeezed orange juice, or select some yummy foods such as the cucumber salad that is hella yummy. The first thing that came to mind when I first saw the buffet was ""god damn this looks healthy"". Once we finished our plates, our main meal was then brought to us. Now I had to step away from our table to attend to some important business and I was gone for a few minutes. When I came back, the gentleman who was looking after us (there's a fancy name for what he does - not a waiter) came over and said that because I was away for a bit, my food would be cold so he'll take it back to the kitchen to heat it up (or maybe make a fresh one, not sure).Like what the hell!? That is service! That is service right there! All of us, all four of us were friggin' impressed by that. Like Mister, that's it. That's it man we're DEFINITELY coming back to this place! Thanks to you Sir!Our last day in Japan and we ended it in The Gate Hotel, Asakusa. Perfect. Absolutely perfect. When you check out right, they give you a paper with your details on it and an eftpost receipt attached to it, yes? Here, they printed the receipt on paper and the gentleman then proceeded to fold it and gently place it in the hotel's envelope. I still have it. The whole thing about this hotel just blows my mind! From the foods, to the staff members and even a frggin' receipt being placed in an envelope. I love it!Located a very short distance from our hotel is the train station. It was a bish to catch a train here because of the many bloody stairs we had to walk down and up to get to our platform. That was torturous with our heavy bags filled with souvenirs but it was entertaining to the locals.Like I mentioned before, the hotel is located across from Sensoji temple. It is a bit eery at night since the temple area is soooooo quiet. Starbucks, 7/11 and a grocery store is also located VERY close by. Like REALLY close by.I would definitely recommend that you add this to your shortlist of hotels to stay in. When I do travel back to Japan, I will be booking The Gate Hotel once again.Thank you for reading this long as review!","Rarotonga, Cook Islands","ArianaMareiRose</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rarotonga, Cook Islands</strong>",18,5.0

The front desk staff can provide you with a map to show you the route which is about 3-5 min walk.The hotel’s restaurant and bar are opened 24 hours so food isn’t an issue during late nights. There are also many CVS (convenience store) such as Lawson, 7-11 and also a 24hr Don Quijote nearby for night shopping which is really convenient.I have stayed in both Style E (essential) and C (Classy) rooms. Style E is 258sqft which is comfortable for 2. If you have a bigger budget, want to enjoy the room or have more than 2 pax, you can consider Style C. Room is very spacious (397sqft) and even has a bar counter. It offers a spectacular view of the Tokyo skytree which you can also see while soaking in the deep bathtub. The toilet has a big window panel which offers daylight good for applying makeup. Bear in mind that nearby buildings may be able to catch a glimpse of the both room and toilet especially at night with your lights on. I checked it from Asakusa culture tourist center’s observation deck. Amenities are sufficient and in Style C, you have both dripped coffee and Nespresso available. Pity coin laundry isn’t available as their laundry service fee is on the higher side.Fabulous view in the restaurant and quality of breakfast is good. One interesting mention is that their honey is not served in jar but rather honeycombs. Really cool! However, their menu offerings are limited and lean more towards an international style; choose a main (egg benedict, French toast etc) and enjoy salad, fruits, yogurt from the buffet line. Being in Japan, I would prefer a Japanese style breakfast so I didn’t opt for breakfast for my next stay.All their staff provides prompt and efficient service; from front desk, restaurant, bar and housekeeping. I have no complains but did wish that they could be a little warmer in attitude and disposition which will be make this hotel 5 stars.With all that it has to offer, The Gate is definitely my first choice of accommodation in Asakusa (having stayed in Asakusa Central and Richmond before).

Room/StaffThe staff were friendly and their service was Excellent!We booked a double room for 2 nights. The day before our checkin, we wanted to place our 2 big luggage bags at the hotel as we did not want to bring them along to our overnight trip out of Tokyo. The request was accepted without any problem. When we checkin the next day, our bags were already in our room. The room was clean, relatively large for Japanese standard. Nice comfy beds. Beds were super single, big enough to squeeze in an adult and a small kid.We had a great view if the Skytree though you can access the top floor as guest.OverallGreat hotel, great staff, great location.

The staff are friendly and helpful - Management great to deal with and highly attentive. I particularly liked that the male manager considered our positive feedback about a staff member and later promoted her from trainee - really nice. The hotel is quiet and relaxing and very clean. Superb assistance from front desk staff regarding places to eat in the local area, storage and forwarding of bags etc. The breakfast is satisfactory but perhaps not on par with other hotels we stayed at in Japan - also not enough Japanese food. After 4 nights the breakfast menu felt a little limiting. We were disappointed that the restaurant did not offer Japanese menu for dinner and so we didn't eat there in the evening - the bar upstairs was limited in terms of food offerings. However, overall a great place to stay, plenty of great places to eat in surrounding areas - we felt incredibly welcomed and attended to by the lovely staff - we certainly will return.","Melbourne, Australia","SueAust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",16,5.0

They have a buffet of salad and pasta (not really breakfast for American standards) plus a selection of 1 of the following 3 options: scrambled eggs, french toast or eggs benedict.

A large Don Quixote is a 5-minute walk away (and it is large and without too many customers compared to other branches). The Sensoji shrine is a mere minute away. Seeing the shrine at night (without the large crowd of tourist) is blissful. Starbucks is right next to the hotel. Many restaurants are around the area. In all, I quite enjoyed the more tranquil experience of this area compared to the more bustling areas like Shinjuku. + Hotel is new and has a beautiful entrance and lobby. + Spacious room. I stayed in the Essential room, and compared to the more cramped up business hotels you find in Shinjuku, this is comfortably much larger. The bathroom is literally twice the size of Prince Hotel's and Sunroute Plaza Shinjuku's where i've stayed before in the past. And like i said, the room is new and more beautifully decorated+ For all the positive points i mentioned above, i feel like i received more bang for the buck compared to the hotels in the busier parts of Tokyo. As i booked my room less than 30 days prior to my arrival, i didnt get the best promotion. The longer you reserve your room ahead, the more discounts you'll receive. This applies to most Japanese hotelsCONS- The only issue that stands out to me is the Asakusa location and accessing it by public transportation. The subway station is the terminal station for the Tokyo Ginza line, and to get around to other areas (Shinjuku, Roppongi, Harajuku), you'll likely need to transfer at Ueno Station (especially if you want to get on JR Yamanote, which is the main train line that runs in a circular route around Tokyo). To get to Shibuya, we didn't need to transfer, but it is EIGHTEEN stations away from Asakusa on the Ginza line. Of course, going to Tokyo Skytree is easy because Asakusa is the first station on the Skytree line. But for most destinations within Tokyo, the Ginza line doesn't cut it. For my next trip to Japan, I will explore hotels in the Ueno, Nippori, Shin Nippori station area as i believe it'll provide good value for money (compared to being in Shinjuku) while being located on the Yamanote line. But by no means is this is a discredit to The Gate Hotel. I was thoroughly happy with my stay.","Bangkok, Thailand","TanawatD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",61,5.0

This is a nice new hotel, but still reasonably priced.It was our first time in Japan and we don't speak Japanese, so we were a little concerned about transportation from Narita airport to Asakusa. But it was fairly easy. Narita terminal 1 has a large Railway/metro station, by the entrance there is a counter where you can buy tickets to Asakusa station by Keisei SkyAccess train (orange line, not the Skyliner!), cash only. Seven bank ATM which offers reasonable rates (associated with 7/11 ) is located to the right and beyond from the counter, they can direct you. Cost is ¥1290. Leaves approx every 40 minutes depending on the time of the day, I'm not sure how much it goes after 6:00 PM. Takes about an hour. Railway station is complicated but very good signs and also in English and color coded lines on the floor. I have to say I was very impressed how good the signs are . Also employees everywhere who can direct you. Hotel is probably best accessible from A4 exit to the right and then couple block to the left, you will see it, it's tall and has a convenience store on the ground floor. Reception on the 13th floor. Rooms are reasonably big ( for Tokyo) and well equipped. They have several different room types, we are in Essential, the most common one. Asking for a higher floor in advance might be helpful otherwise you will see back side of the buildings in the side street, like us from the 5 th floor. Most of the essential rooms are facing the side street but I imagine the top floor ones can have nice panoramic views. Otherwise there is a beautiful view from the roof top terrace and 13th floor restaurant. I really enjoy their breakfast. It's ¥ 2100 walk in. Small buffet, but delicious, Choice of three hot dishes toorder from, eggs Benedict or scrambled or French toast. On the buffet are fresh organic vegetables, mixed young salat, tomatoes, some steamed veggies and roasted eggplant etc, pasta, potatoes, delicious little croissants and bread, home made orange preserve, yogurt, granola, honeycomb, fresh fruit and fresh squeezed orange juice made to order. Senjo ji temple is across the street. And there are hundreds little restaurants and shops in the streets around the hotel. Starbucks couple buildings to the left, supermarket in the building and pharmacy next door. We found Backstreet guides and had private tours of Tokyo and Kamakura. Very professional, knowledgeable and pleasant to deal with it. I can really recommend !!! Made our first visit to Tokyo so enjoyable and easy. They customize their tours according to what you want to see or they make suggestions. We are just staying in Japan for a week and we wanted to experience a different city then Tokyo. So we also booked a small group tour of Kyoto with Backstreet guides. Left hotel at 6:00 AM, took bullet train ( Nozomi Shikanzen ) to Kyoto, took a tour, and were back in the hotel at 7:30 PM. Bullet train was fun ( although a little pricey fun, $236 round trip). So overall, this is a great hotel and a good base for exploring Tokyo, if you prefer not to stay downtown or want a reasonable price for a very decent hotel. By the way beds are pretty comfortable with nice duvets and pillows. Hope that if you decide to try The Gate Hotel you will enjoy it as much as we did !",Oregon,"Sophia4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oregon</strong>",23,5.0

Everything about this place was pretty stellar. I'm a fan of good design, I can stay at a drab hotel and not be too bothered, but a good design aesthetic just makes me that much more comfortable and gives me a general sense of well being. The Gate Hotel has good design in spades. I read some reviews that described this hotel as standard, I don't really get how anyone could say that. Maybe as an American I just haven't seen enough swanky hotels, to me a standard hotel room is: White walls, earth tones, and maybe a landscape painting on the wall. The Gate is completely the opposite, check out the pictures at the end of this review (and everyone else's). It's not just the fact that the walls are dark that make this place different, it's the details, the colorful frame around the mirror in the room, the large illuminated egg in the corner of the hallway, the illuminated glass corner of the bathroom, the beautifully odd ""chandelier"" in the lobby...trust me, this place is far from typical. I'd describe it as designy and swanky in the best possible way, and the views from the room and the upper deck are fantastic.The hotel lobby is situated high in the building, which is different, and not a problem. You take an elevator up and as the doors open you're greeted with the sight of the aforementioned chandelier and large, nearly floor to ceiling windows with beautiful views of Tokyo. The front desk staff are extremely courteous and professional while still being friendly, they do polite in Japan very well, it's impressive. Checking in was a breeze.The room itself is well arranged and spacious. Even with the good design it was all very comfortable. The bathroom was even spacious, having an area for the toilet (Japanese style, with bidet spray and temperature controls) and the sink as you enter and then a separate chamber for the shower and bath. What I really liked was the traditional Japanese set-up: there's a tiled area with a sort of hand-shower and a stool where you could pre-rinse/post rinse before and after your bath, which just makes you feel a whole lot cleaner.As you enter the room (our room, anyway, we had an ""essential double"" room) there's a closet on the left, and then a long desk and chair. To the right is the bed with a small table and comfy chairs between it and the outer wall, where a large window offered a spectacular view of Tokyo and Senso-ji temple. Luggage could be placed at the foot of the bed leaving enough room to pass between the door and bathroom to the window and table. The desk had some space where you could stash stuff also, and the closet, although small, could probably accommodate at least one rolling suitcase from what I remember. The bed was very comfortable and of course everything was clean, it's Japan.Beyond the room: I'd read before going to Japan that The Gate had an upper floor bar and viewing deck but people were complaining that there was a cover charge to gain entry, even for hotel guests. This turned out to be false. I don't know if they changed their policy or what, but we'd been informed when checking in that we could just go on up to the deck, and that was true. The view from the deck was nothing short of spectacular, the Sky Tree was prominent and glowing, and you could take in a dazzling slice of Tokyo while sipping a nice drink. As a side note, the hotel bar had a Japanese whisky called Hakushu which was excellent, if you're into that sort of thing.On our last night in Tokyo we ate at the restaurant at The Gate, it was our one expensive dinner in Tokyo and it was worth it, fancy food that tastes fancy, not just looks it. Again, the views from the restaurant were also stellar, being pretty much the same view from the deck.All in all our stay at the Gate Hotel was excellent, it really was the sort of place where you feel like you're experiencing something special. We very much enjoyed our stay and I didn't want to leave, we'd definitely return again on future visits to Tokyo, highly recommended!","Seattle, Washington","David S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",24,5.0

I was travelling with a friend & it was a first time in Tokyo. I had selected this hotel as I wanted to stay in a 'different' part of Tokyo and Asakusa met the brief. Whilst Asakusa is busy during the day with tourists visiting nearby shrines and shops, during the evening it was quiet but with a wide a array of excellent restaurants frequented by locals.I had booked a 'scenic' twin room for our stay & it exceeded our expectations. The positives were:-Hotel Room- I had booked a 'Scenic Room' We were on the 6th floor and we had a fantastic view of the street below - the people watching was great and we had views of the local landmarks. The room was also a great size. The room easily fitted two king single beds, plus two armchairs and a coffee table (conveniently located next to a big picture window).Location - Asakusa a good location because (a) it was some great restaurants but is a bit quieter at night than some other parts of Tokyo (b) It is home to two subway lines and a JR line so it's very easy to get about (c) it is easily accessible from Narita Airport - there is a direct subway line Hotel - very clean and very pleasant staff. Decor is very nice; there is a great roof top bar for the exclusive use of hotel guests & the restaurant has nice (if a little unimaginative..) food and a fabulous view. There is free wi-fi throughout the hotelNegatives:-None really but in terms of location - if you are looking to go out clubbing every night, Asakusa isn't the area for you.

The decor in the room was clean and modern, and suited our tastes. We had loads of room for our huge cases too. The only downside was we could not get the wi-fi to work at all with our windows phones. Not an issue though with a starbucks a couple of doors down for brekkie and day planning.We did not use the restaurant as breakfast was way too pricey (I'm a bowl of yoghurt kinda girl, and didn't want to pay over the odds for that... Starbucks suited us much better)The location in terms of Senso-ji was perfect, and its super easy to get to the sky tree from there. The downside is not being on a JR line - so you cant use your passes on the ginza line.

The bed was also very comfortable, being comfortably firm with a little give instead of the overly hard firm other mattresses we experienced in Japan. The bathroom was small (normal for Japan) but exactly what one needed with all the amenities - deep tub, double shower head, lavender bath salts, large fluffy towels, washing towels, etc. Most important is that it is quiet in the rooms and the temperature adjustable to exactly what you want (ask staff about controls if necessary).

All told we stayed in 12 hotels and Ryoken and this Hotel rated #1 in the hotels for us. Located about 8 mins from the centre of Tokyo by tube it is well positioned and above all quiet.The rooms are a decent size given others we stayed in later on our journey, they are exceptionally quiet, clean and well presented. 2 mins walk away is the Kaminarimon gate and temple, 5 mins is the tube and ferry station as well as various shopping experiences.Anyway, back to the hotel itself. The staff were professional but exceptionally friendly, nothing was too much trouble for them at all. Whilst the breakfast was fairly limited in choice, what they did, they did very well indeed, my wife says the eggs Benedict are the best she has had!If you get chance have an evening meal in the restaurant, but be prepared for it to be a relaxed affair, if you want food in a hurry, dine outside the hotel. However, after a day in Tokyo you will more than appreciate the chance to slow down and catch up with yourself.The rooftop bar is a must visit as it is a quiet haven where you can sit and enjoy a drink as well as a view, this is something that IMHO the hotel undersells and should make more of. The views of Tokyo at night are very good and worth a photo opportunity, we found the bar staff are good with a camera and iPhone.This was an absolutely perfect Hotel for us to start our Japan adventure as it allowed us to recover from the 12 hour flight and 9 hour time difference whilst at the same time being in Tokyo allowing us to explore without too much effort.Would we go back? Absolutely, there is no decision to be made the Gate Hotel ticks all the boxes for us.","Douglas, United Kingdom","Andrew C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Douglas, United Kingdom</strong>",57,5.0

Exit at A4 and walk down the street upon reaching the junction, turn left and walk on for about 3 minutes and you'll reach the hotel. The tokyo metro subway station is also very close to the hotel which will get you to Ginza, Shibuya and Ueno, where you can change to the JR lines or catch the Shinkansen.The rooms are not very large but big enough for 2 adults. Wifi is complimentary. The bathroom is well equipped with all the amenities you need. Breakfast is great with 3 selections for mains and an organic salad buffet and the freshly squeezed orange juice is a favorite of mine. The hotel lobby and rooftop bar has beautiful views of the Tokyo sky tree and Senso ji temple.I really love the neighborhood of Asakusa, it's not as crowded as Shinjuku or Shibuya and you can take leisurely strolls. There are lots of good grilled eel and tempura restaurants around the hotel and a great red bean pastry snack shop one block away from the hotel. Best part of all, if you don't like the day crowd at Senso ji (which is diagonally across the hotel) you can visit it at night and take photos of it and your pictures will be like those on the postcards (as in without people).Another plus point of the hotel is the supermarket right next door where you can get lovely japanese grown strawberries, persimmons, apples and mandarins and your supply of drinking water. I cannot complement the hotel anymore with its friendly staff and atmosphere. It's definitely value for money and worth every yen. If I'm force to make a complaint, it would be that there is no free English channel on TV.","Singapore, Singapore","Lawrence G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",87,5.0

We decided to spend a little more so that our base would be comfortable, and it was terrific. OK, so I wish there were staff members more fluent in English, and yes, I couldn't figure out the Japanese toilet (so many buttons, really?). But we were so happy with the room itself with its amazing view from the 12th floor. Fantastic shower and bath, bed was comfortable, and plenty of room to move around (which was important to us). The in-room espresso maker was great. The location of this hotel could not have been better. Such amazing little local restaurants surrounding the hotel, right on key subway lines, and that ever important 7-11 a block away. Loved morning runs along the river a few blocks away. Even did a day trip to Nikko with the Tobu train leaving from the station a few blocks away. The market and shrine at Senjo-ji is right there, which always gave us some quick entertainment if we wanted to get out of the hotel for a little bit. For the Americans reading this -- it's a great choice. It's 100% manageable without feeling like you're in an American hotel, and you get an area of Tokyo with character AND convenience. You get to Ginza and Shibuya on one subway line (easy). Ueno is walking distance or three subway stops away. The hotel bar and the restaurant were super easy each morning and evening for us, before and after our tourist adventures. Internet was dependable and robust. We never heard another guest.

The receptionists ALWAYS went out of their way to provide any information or help we needed. When we checked out of the hotel, the receptionist ran down to the outside pavement to ensure that our taxi driver would leave us at the correct part of the humongous Tokyo station for the bullet train. Another receptionist tried tirelessly to get us a last minute booking at some top Michelin star restaurants.

Without being asked he would provide us with linen and cutlery to eat the fruit we had brought along us.The common areas like the aforementioned terrace, the restaurant and the reception were chic and trendy. The bedrooms' styling was a little less successful. We had rented two rooms- a larger twin and a doubled bedded room. Both were a little small, but i suppose that just reflects the lack of space in crowded Tokyo. What I also cared less for was the dark colour of the rooms which made already smallish rooms feel a bit cramped. Having said that, the beds were very comfortable and I liked the thick cotton pyjamas provided. I also found the toiletries of high quality and chic like the hotel.

Expected a luxurious stay to match the price. Maybe it's because I'm from San Francisco that I didn't find the hotel ""cool"" (which they were obviously trying to be). Sleeping in an all-black room didn't excite me. First of all, maybe it was my fault but when I arrived at 5:50, I was told that I should hurry and register as there was only 10 minutes left for the happy hour. The staff person pointed to a paper that said there was wine and non-alcoholic drinks during happy hour on the terrace. And the drinks had a ""value"" of approximately $5. In the U.S., when something says there's a ""value"" of some amount, that means you're getting a bargain and not paying the full ""value"" amount. So, as he instructed, I rushed up to the terrace. Since I don't drink, I asked for a non-alcoholic drink and what they had (and what I was served) was a half glass of orange juice (from concentrate, not fresh). In Japan, apparently ""value"" means something different because I was handed a bill for approximately $5. Again, maybe my fault.Second (and more importantly), aLthough I had been too warm in many of the small rooms in Japan hotels, I was SO cold in this one. Called the front desk to ask for help with the A/C controls and a woman came up with wool blankets (apparently I wasn't the first to complain). She looked at the A/C controls and said ""apparently this hotel doesn't have heat"". The problem was that even in th ""off"" position, the A/C was continuing to run. Could only get warm enough by getting into bed with the wool blankets.The next morning I asked to stay 2 extra hours ( there's a roughly $20 charge to stay 2 hours past the 11:00 check out time) at no charge because it had been so cold the night before. The front desk women apparently thought that was the funniest thing they'd ever heard because each one explained (in Japanese) to the one beside her what my request was while laughing hysterically. Fortunately, someone said they'd ask the manager and within minutes, returned to tell me that was fine.It was a bad experience all around and I will never stay here again.","Oakland, California","KonaReefCondoOwner</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland, California</strong>",11,2.0

This is not what you want after a long flight with no sleep.However, Reception was modern, with amazing views and very nice staff. We were taken to our rooms and helped with the luggage. We had interconnecting rooms which was a nice touch. The rooms were a good size for Tokyo hotels and well-equipped, if a little shabby in places. We were confronted with our first sight of all-singing, all-dancing Japanese loos. Actually, they probably did sing and dance for all we knew. Didn't have a clue what most of the features were but lived in terror of the fountain! We had a super lunch on the outside terrace of the hotel restaurant. Excellent food and ridiculously cheap. Five pounds a head. Very elegant setting, great service. An amazing price. Dinner for the three of us the next night, when we ate ourselves to a stanstill, was only 45 pounds. I would certainly recommend the restaurant, even if you are not staying in the hotel. Plus, for the smokers among you, you can smoke.

It is very close to the metro and there is an excellent supermarket nearby. Also Starbucks next door.Each room cost us just over a hundred pounds a night. That's the sort of price you might pay for a hostel. Believe me, this is not that. It is five star luxury and service.

Absolutely loads of eating places ranging from tourist focussed to those suitable for locals that our Japanese friends took us too. Excellent Iron Grill steak house (Wagyu beef) just up the road too. Subways are a right at hand and it is only 20 minutes to the incredible fish market (a must see). Within 7 minutes walk is the district that sells kitchen knives - so for those hunting for high end Japanese cutlery this is the other place to go apart from the fish market. Reverting to the hotel itself, the rooms are modestly sized, but comfortable, quite, have great views and good bathrooms (not the dreaded plastic shower curtains that some western style hotels have - an instant sign of low quality!).

The hotel is conveniently located, only being 2-3 minutes from the Asakusa line and 5-10 minutes to the Ginza and Keisei line to Narita airport. The tour spot of Sensoji also 2-3 minutes away and 5-10 minutes walk to the shopping strip. AMBIANCE: The actual building is very low profile. The exterior is in suave black and when you enter there is no one or nothing other than a ceiling of streaming water and 3 elevators. If I remember correctly, the check-in lobby is located on the 17th floor, where upon entry you are greeted into a simple yet opulent lobby complemented with a panoramic view of the Tokyo Tower. SERVICE: Upon check-in, it was standard and courteous. They requested payment before check-in, as informed on the email exchanges. When we arrived in our room I immediately found an anniversary greeting from the hotel which was unexpected. Both the room and the view was a complementing contrast, with an undisturbed view of the historical Sensoji temple and the chic bold modern interiors of the room. One notable interaction with the hotel staff was when I contacted front desk and requested for an ironing board and iron, in a matter of 5 to 10 minutes one of the ladies from the front desk arrived with the items. As this was towards the end of our Japan trip, I was still impressed with the consistency of efficient customer service. Service was pretty much seamless and placid in all the facets of services I encountered with the hotel. ROOM: If I recall correctly our room was on the 7th floor (Style E, Essential). Entering the room what I noticed foremost was the chlorine markings on the floor. At first, my immediate reaction was to request for a different room, then I noticed the welcoming anniversary letter and the beautiful view they have given us of the Sensoji temple and pagoda, and decided not to be a diva about it. The room is designed with dark wallpaper, juxtaposed with the colourful accented furniture and fixtures. Though not my personal preference, I found the room to fit its intended boutique modern feel. Please note they do not serve room service in the room and encourage people to go to their Bar & Restaurant upstairs. FOOD: As previously mentioned room service is not available in the rooms, they encourage guests to dine in the Bar & Restaurant upstairs. In the contemporary Gate Hulic Bar & Restaurant we chanced upon having breakfast the following day. Our arrival was warmly welcomed, from who I assume was the Supervisor or Manager, even if we had arrived close to the cut off time for breakfast. I also requested Matcha tea to which they did not usually serve according to the Supervisor/Manager, but found a way to realise my request.My partner and I also saw Starbucks situated beside the hotel, also there is a supermarket 2 minutes away, a family mart past the hotel, a burger place and several Japanese restaurants around, so you will not go hungry. Occasion: Ideal for business accommodation, couples, honeymooners, friends or groups that would like to experience boutique accommodation in a convenient location. UPSIDE:- You get what you paid for- View of Tokyo tower, Sensoji temple and pagoda- Location, close to 3 train stations (Asakusa line, Ginza line, and Keisei line to Narita airport) - Walking distance to shopping (specialty kitchen accessories)- Quiet locationDOWNSIDE:- If you have heavy luggages going by Keisei line to Narita airport it is not ideal as there are lots of stairs to the actual train. Catch a taxi if you can- it'll make your life easier. PRICING: For 5 night, for 2 adults we spent JPY95,287. That is approximately AU$994.608 in total, making that AU$198.92 per night. After booking Gate Hulic, I also came across the information that this hotel is recommended in the the Michelin guide. So I had very high expectations. After coming from the immaculate Shiraume also mentioned in the Michelin Guide, the chlorine marking on the carpet which I saw every time I came in and out the room was the deal breaker for me, I couldn't simply ignore it. Though for the price, the beautiful view they have given us and the convenient location they were situated in, it evened it out. I definitely wouldn't mind staying here again given the chance, the hotel is an ideal place to stay if you are celebrating a special occasion, don’t mind a smudge on the floor and want a fabulous boutique experience.","Sydney, Australia","Kbaria</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",52,4.0

We visited Shinjuku, Shibuya, Imperial Palace and Hakone, all without feeling that we had too far to return in the evening.Best of all, there is a train direct from the airport to the station a couple of blocks from the hotel - even travelling with an elderly parent, it was easy to get around using just the regular metro system.Design and finish of the hotel is beautiful - a real oasis to return to in the evening, it had a very high quality boutique feel considering the price in such a great location.Very good value - i'd absolutely stay here again and recommend the same to others.","Hong Kong, China","MrAndMrsLim</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",80,5.0

The hotel is literally near almost all the subway and train stations in Asakusa. It's such a great location, you can walk to food, tons of shopping and all the Asakusa sights. It's also easy to get to the Tokyo Skytree or any other place in Tokyo because of convenient access to trains. The hotel is modern and nicely decorated. I've been traveling for weeks in Asia for work and this hotel was good. We had a corner room which had a great view. The bathroom also is split in two so the shower and toilet area are somewhat separate and large. The staff was also very friendly and helpful with directions. There's also a rooftop bar with GREAT views of the Skytree Tower and this part of Tokyo. The hotel claimed free WiFi but we couldn't get any of our phones to connect even with the password.

Across the street is the Nakamise Arcade shopping areas with blocks of interesting shops and restaurants. The Shrine is immediately adjacent as is the Sumida River and its cruises. The Asakusa station can take you one stop to Skytree or the Metro (3 stops) to Ueno Station/Park (or anyplace). The hotel lobby sits next to the Oseki Supermarket and leads to the 13th floor lobby. The hotel is new, clean, modern average sized comfortable rooms. The lobby has a super view of the area and the cafe/bar is really a great spot for just relaxing! The staff was very helpful and friendly. Communication was no issue. Also great was that the Asakusa line went directly (45 minutes) to Haneda airport (I believe it was less than $10USD).

""Oh, all the teppanyaki restaurants there are nice."" and he didn't bothered to give me any recommendation at all!Next, I asked about transportation to the airport and I told the staff that I will be leaving tomorrow night. He gave me two options - to take a taxi somewhere (I can't remember the name of the two places now) for about 1,000yen and I can then take the airport limousine bus (I told him that because I have a very heavy luggage so I don't want to take the train). He said the whole journey takes less than an hour.When I checked out the next night at around 8.30pm (my flight was close to mid-night), I was shocked when the staff told me that the last airport limousine bus has already left at 8.30pm and the other will be leaving at 8.45pm! To make matter worst, this female staff (I didn't see her name) was extremely rude and unhelpful and she gave me that look like I was an idiot that I didn't know the timing of the last bus! She was hitting the keyboard so hard when I asked her to help me check on the timing for the train and she was also quite impatient when I confirmed with her again on the direction to go to the train station where there is an elevator. I must say she is the RUDEST hotel staff I have ever met.Since I told the first male staff the day before that I will be leaving at night, he could have at least asked me what time I was leaving or tell me about the timing for the last bus.","Singapore, Singapore","ilovethebeach06</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",47,3.0

The check in is on the 13th floor which is a perfect entrance so you can see the amazing view that is offered. Pros:1) All guests should make use of the outdoor roof deck, it is only accessible if you are a guest. Don’t worry if it there is a slight chill, they also provide heat lamps.2) The location of the hotel is perfect for the Sensoji Temple, souvenir shopping and delicious eats. There are plenty of booths for multiple flavors of soft serve ice cream, mochi, red bean filled pastries, fresh breads and other delicious bites. You can spend several hours just wandering the souvenir booths and eat your way through as well. 3) They have a Mister Donut near by, not sure if others are a big fan like me but those glazed little munchkin rings are the best. I bought half a dozen.Cons: 1) The hotel said it would only take 45 mins to the airport. It took well into an hour or hour and half. The directions weren’t as clear as they could have been, or there must’ve been a train delay because we were stuck on what seemed like a local train for the better part of the commute. It was so hot and crowded I almost felt faint. I would much rather of taken the shuttle bus options or a train from Tokyo. The hotel should provide a small card that guests can show when they reach the train station in order to be directed on the correct train. 2) The train station was close by walking wise, but carrying luggage through that train station as not fun. It is a few levels transfer, so if you can find an elevator, take it. 3) If you stay an time beyond checkout they charge you.

Asakusa is a great area to stay in, plenty to see with a huge variety of restaurants, and the hotel is very close to the station and easy to find. We had breakfast included in our room rate and it was a real highlight every morning with exceptional service and a constant supply of fresh hand-squeezed orange juice.

You sacrifice room floor space for the extra bed though so that's why you could consider just the two oversized twins. The bathroom was big and very clean. The restaurant is open 24 hours which is particularly helpful for jet lagged travelers. Great location and views, and we got anywhere else we wanted with subway as well as to airport easily.

The trouble with Tokyo is its so huge and slightly intimidating its tempting to just stay in the same place over and over because it's at least familiar and you know how to get from A to B - so booking this hotel was a risk. The area is actually fantastic. Its full of authentic restaurants and bars and the hotel is almost opposite one of the main tourist attractions in Tokyo. The Kaminarimon Gate and Senso-ji temple. This does mean it also has a mix of touristy places but it's all fun, fab, interesting things that make you smile. The hotel itself is new, has a slightly incongruous entrance on the ground floor with a lift that takes you to the 10th floor to check in. The lobby has a mouth droppingly awesome view. If you can get over the impressive chandelier in the lobby itself you have an uninterrupted view of the Sky Tree tower and the Asahi HQ. Look the other way and you get a birds eye view of the nearby temples. Next to the reception desk (which is superbly staffed by lovely people with excellent English) is a restaurant/bar where breakfast, lunch and dinner is available plus 24hr food should you need it. There is also an outside terrace with tables for the summer. Head up a few more floors and there's a small but perfect bar with the same amazing views but only space for about 10 at the bar. You feel like you're in a New York speakeasy but it annoyingly closes at midnight. Outside is an even large terrace with chairs for the summer months. The rooms themselves are also really spacious, modern, non smoky and with huge bathrooms. I had a bath tub and a walk in shower separate to my toilet and sink. All of this is very unusual for Japanese hotels. I can't recommend this hotel enough. The staff really were fabulous with a. Few annoying issue I had outside of the hotel.

It is a five minute walk from the hotel to the elevator entrance that leads almost directly to the Asakusa platform where the Keisei line Narita Express trains goes to the airport in 50 minutes (beware not during peak hour!!) for one third the price of the Limousine Bus (¥1200).

Room: The amenities include: blow dryer, headband, toothbrush, comb, pajamas, facial wash, razor, and an in-room thermostat. On the 5th floor, I found the room to be silent at night.

There is honestly not really designer decor except the ""egg"" (you will know what I mean when you stay there). Not much details put into the ""design"" of the room.

It has been a long time since I had this dish, and I have never had it in Japan. They cooked it very well and the sauce was quite exceptional. I was very impressed actually with the quality of the food. The vegetables and fruit in the buffet in the morning were advertised organic, farm to table, produce. They squeezed the orange juice right at the buffet table as well, though, this makes it a bit strong.Finally, check-out was great because there was no need to go to the lobby on the top floor.

Location: Great if you're planning to visit the northern bit of Tokyo - Tokyo Sky Tree, Ueno and Akihabara are all a few short stops away. Might be a bit trickier if you wanted to spend most of your time in Shinjuku / Shibuya and Harajuku though but I switched hotels by that part of my trip. There's also plenty of food options within a 5-10 minute walk around the area - sushi, ramen and even fast food options for those craving something more familiar - though most Japanese restaurants seem to close at around 9PM on a weekday. Staff service / English language: Staff was very accommodating and patient, though communicating in English was at times a bit difficult and required repetition and written instructions. Was a bit disappointed when one staff advised that there was no Hakone cable car when I later found out from Odakyu travel centre that there indeed was such a service...Improvements: 1) Staff could be better trained at providing travel advice to tourists... 2) Would be great if the hotel could provide bottled water in the room, particularly as it was the absolute height of summer when we visited...
