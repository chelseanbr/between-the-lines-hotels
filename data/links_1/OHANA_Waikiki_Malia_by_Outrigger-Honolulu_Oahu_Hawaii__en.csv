Definitely not worth $250+ a night, however- as there are hotels just as nice for about 1/2 this rate all around Honolulu. Tried to sign up for their frequent guest program, was unable to do so due to glitch in system. After a trip to the front desk, calling Outrigger Central in Colorado- they had to call me back to give me my special Discovery membership number. When I inquired if my number was plugged into my current stay's folio, the clerk says ""I'm sorry, but we don't participate in that program."" What the hell ?? Why did I sign up for your frequent guest program ?? What's my incentive to stay here again ?? What a waste of time. Offering a frequent guest program that only certain Outrigger Hotels utilize, good luck trying to decipher which ones do.

The hotel was ok. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were of a decent size (we had 1.5 beds and a small balcony facing the street). On the other hand they can't call this bath tub a pool cause it is really not one!! But since the ocean is pretty close by, we didn't really need it. I also get that the hotel is old and would probably need a bit of renovations, but it could be cleaner I have to admit... but beds were clean and comfortable, which is what is important in the end! But the hotel employees were what we loved the most about that place. They were always there help us and answer all of our questions.

The location is so fun. You can walk to the beach or places to eat and it’s awesome waking up and looking out over a bustling island city. My feedback is more for the parent company—outrigger, because I believe that the issues with this hotel need to be addressed by them. This hotel is badly neglected. We had a one bedroom kitchenette in the Luana tower and it was hard to get comfortable because everything in the room appears as if it’s been there since the 70’s. I don’t mind the oldschool beachy style of the rooms but the lamps, wallpaper, drapes and furniture actually look and feel like they’ve been there for decades. Very old and in poor condition. Housekeeping was great about tidying but there are some things the owners need to address—like throwing out old, grimy upholstered chairs and benches, putting fitted sheets on the beds and a vanity in the bathroom. Instead of a regular fitted and flat sheet our beds had a bare mattress with a blanket folded on top of it for extra cushioning and a flat sheet tucked in on top of that, followed by another flat sheet and the flowered bedspreads. They were great about bringing extra pillows and blankets as needed but I thought the lack of fitted sheets and the extra blanket between the mattress and sheet was really odd. There was nothing but a tiny glass shelf directly above the toilet in the bathroom so if your toiletries don’t fit on the little shelf you must place them on the back of the toilet. Either way you risk dropping your belongings in the toilet. The water pressure was great but bathroom fixtures are rusty, the grout is black, there was what appeared to be a blood stain on one of the flower printed bed covers and there were stains (from food?) all over the nasty yellow wall paper. The green carpet is separating from the baseboards and in the space under the counter where the mini fridge was there was a huge gap next to the fridge where the top layer of flooring was missing leaving whatever is under the floor exposed. Like others said there are hardly any outlets and you have to reach behind old furniture to access them. The lamps are so old and dusty-looking that I didn’t want to touch them to turn them on. It is well past time for outrigger to throw out the old, tired, wooden and upholstered furniture. Also, we paid resort and hotel fees upfront so no surprises there but I didn’t like that there was a random unauthorized $50 hold that was placed (and eventually released) on my account the day we checked out. TL;DR Nice staff and fantastic location but I would not recommend this hotel and I would not stay here again unless they replaced the flooring, wallpaper, drapes and furniture at minimum.",California,"usvserrybody</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",0,2.0

However, even with lowered expectations I was disappointed. Starting with the good - the staff was polite and the room was quiet (hence more than one star). I can't say anything good about the other aspects of my stay. The most egregious problem was that there was garbage left in my hotel room. I think there is some kind of recycling program in place, but a plastic bag full of used shampoo and other plastic bottles had been left on the counter in my room, and I guess housekeeping just decided to let me find there there. Second, the room was billed as ""water view"". I have attached pictures, and I'll let you judge. Technically, yes, after a bit of searching you can see a sliver of ocean, but this is a description only a lawyer could love.Finally, the hotel charges a mandatory ""resort"" fee. This hotel is not a resort by any definition of the word, and tacking on this fee is a sleazy business practice. When I raised this with the staff at the front desk, they explained that is was a way of reducing how much tax gets paid on the room rate. Somehow they thought that describing this fee as a tax dodge would make it seem _less_ sleazy. You know who doesn't charge a hidden ""resort"" fee? AirBnBs.

The pool is a little over two metres wide sandwiched between the hotel and the neighbouring building: you will have to go to the beach if you want a tan. Other ""amenities"" include a Rivals sports bar (very efficient and friendly staff) and an IHOP (poor service and high prices) - whether these are the cafe and restaurant mentioned in their web page is unclear.

During our 2nd week there 3 of the 4 washing machines were down so there was very much a line of people waiting to use the 1 that was available. The only thing I’d recommend about the self laundry room was more ventilation. It was super hot and stuffy in there. We loved how bright the room was. There was so much natural light!There are 3 elevators... only one goes to the parking garage which can make for some long waits or figuring out a way around it (like going to a higher floor then taking the stairs for the remaining floors.The parking garage (a whopping $35/day) was interesting...

The pressure was so low that hair shampooing was almost impossible! On the 3rd day the door to our room would not unlock and required a new door lock to be fitted, so after 4 trips up and down to reception getting new keys, we were offered another room to move to, which we did. On arriving at the new room, we met unacceptable cleaning issues, long black hair on the toilet seat and all round the bathtub. Also the dust in the bedside table was thick enough to write in!

There was a fabulous restaurant called Appetito just outside the hotel within the block and they had various drink specials.We took a tour to the Mighty Mo, Arizona and Bowfin and the tour bus picked us up at the hotel. On another tour, we just had to go 2 blocks away to the main street to pick up that bus.We got an Uber 2x's and that work perfect!We were close to Waikiki Beach (5-7 minute walk) and the time spent there was so much fun.

Although this is definitely not a 5 star hotel, the service is what you get at a 5 star hotel.We stayed there for 4 nights. Firstly the location is great. It's a 2 minute walk to the main street (with all the shops and restaurants) and you can use your room key to travel around on the Pink Line bus which actually drops you off opposite the hotel. We arrived before noon - but the gentleman on reception got us checked in right away. The room is nothing special, but the beds and pillows were very comfortable, the water pressure was great and the water was hot. Each day at reception they had a bowl of flowers and bobby-pins so that you could put a fresh flower in your hair. A simple but unexpected touch.Every member of staff that we interacted with at the hotel was incredibly friendly and helpful. We weren't leaving for the airport until 7pm and because the hotel was so busy, we weren't able to get a late check-out. We had a snorkelling trip booked for that morning and Roy offered to store our luggage for the day and explained that he could offer us the use of a complimentary hospitality room later that afternoon so that we could come back and shower and freshen up after our snorkelling adventure before heading to the airport. That was something that we didn't expect but made a huge difference to us before we started out 17 hour journey home.We had mentioned that we'd head down to the beach for a last drink at sunset before coming back to grab our luggage and taxi to the airport. We walked into the hotel lobby and Tony (the bell-hop) already had our luggage out of storage waiting for us - along with a taxi.

When we went to shower we noticed that there was mold everywhere, and a huge bubble in the tub, it was like we were walking on bubble wrap and the drain didn't work so when we would shower our legs were sitting in dirty water. I told the front desk on the first day and on the second day they said they tried their best to fix it but couldn't. I was told that there was nothing they could do to help us. When I was checking towels out on our second to last day there the woman was like oh yea your the room where the shower isn't working and said if we wanted to change rooms we could. Why is it that when I asked, I was told no and that if I wanted to go to the top floor I would have to pay!!!! It had to be by chance that I ran into her at the front desk! When we moved into the next room, we noticed that there was a giant (i mean full wall from ceiling to floor) stain of coffee right behind the door.

Although bit dated it is clean and quite nice. Our room was rather big and had safebox, mini-fridge and coffee maker. The accompanying bathroom came with the bathtub. The internet was included in the resort fee (not cheap!) and was of decent speed however you need to make login every single day. The staff was really friendly and helpful, they suggested a hotel shuttle for going to the airport which is less expensive than the regular taxi and equally comfortable. The only downside is the hotel garage. We read the reviews beforehand so we thought we knew what to expect however nothing can prepare you for this garage! It is simply horrific: not easily accessible, very steep especially when going down and out of it, which is almost impossible if someone is not navigating you - and not to mention one-way entrance&exit! Not being in your car but in rental only makes it worse for the fear of scratching it. And above all it doesn't come cheap! Yes it is Waikiki and yes as hotel guests you have privileged price but 30 $ for overnight stay is way too pricey for this horrible experience. A piece of advice: try your luck to find free parking along Ala Wai canal - just be patient, make 2 or 3 circles and make sure you don't leave it there on Mondays and Fridays from 8.30 till 11.30 pm to avoid towing because of street sweeping.","Zagreb, Croatia","611ivanaj</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Zagreb, Croatia</strong>",85,4.0

The reception staff were very friendly and helpful upon check in, I was hosting a large group and they expedited the guests to their rooms very efficiently. In the lobby area, there is an agent from Expedia who sells tours; she is very knowledgeable and I felt safer reserving tours with her than with the individuals on the streets that sell similar tours. We wanted to do a Luau and she recommended the Chief's Luau which was excellent. My only negative about the hotel was that the rooms did not get cleaned until very late in the day, sometimes after 3pm and one day our garbage was not removed at all; it could have been a staffing issue as we were there over Thanksgiving. The hotel has a jacuzzi and a very small swimming pool on site. There is a bar/restaurant too and there is also an IHOP next door as well as a pizza stand (the pizza was quite expensive). The rooms are dated and the views are not great, we were at the back of the hotel and the view was just buildings and rooftops; if you were on the front of the hotel, it may be more noisy since it is a busy street.

We booked this place through Costco Travel and were looking for a place to stay in Oahu but we knew we weren't going to be in the room very much so we just wanted something decent. This place was NOT decent. First of all, we booked this place thinking there was a kitchen in it so we could save some money cooking breakfast and what not. There was a sink & a microwave and they called that a kitchen. The plates and silverware in the ""kitchen"" looked like they hadn't been washed in months. The put us in a room with a full bed for our HONEYMOON. I called the front desk to complain and let them know that we weren't satisfied and that it was our honeymoon. I was looking for something to tell me that they cared about their guests to make it right with me. They even put me on the phone with the manager. He pretty much told me to pound sand and better luck next time. It was by far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in on a vacation. Luckily we didn't have to spend much time in there, it actually forced us to go out more and explore since we didn't want to spend any time in the room. The bathroom was the size of a coat closet, the shower was nasty & small, next to zero sink space. The room hadn't been updated since the 80's would be my guess. I guess the worst part of it all is that they knew it was our honeymoon and they did nothing to try and remedy the situation with us. I would expect a little more from them when they for all intensive purposes catfished us with the pictures and descriptions of the rooms. Spring for the hotel that's a few $100 more, you will not regret it. This place is awful!!!",,jason f,2,1.0

Located just a couple blocks from the beach (and a single block from the Royal Hawaiian Centre and all the action on Kalakaua Avenue), the Ohana Waikiki Malia by Outrigger offers budget friendly rooms in a clean and secure hotel. Part of the Outrigger hotel chain, the Ohana Waikiki Malia by Outrigger has a 24 hour IHOP restaurant and a sports bar that shows NFL games & UFC fights. Not what you'll find at the Four Seasons, but then for $112 + tax per night in Waikiki, can you complain? The Ohana Waikiki Malia by Outrigger is an older property, but its location is excellent.I stayed 4 nights in room 1629. The room, while not large, did feature a king size bed, comfortable pillows & lines, flat screen tv, a basic washroom with tub/shower combo, a safe and a fridge! All employees, from the front desk to room service, provided pleasant service with a smile and an ""Aloha"" greeting. Overall, for Waikiki and considering the low cost (for Waikiki), the Ohana Waikiki Malia by Outrigger does well for itself. True, you will find yourself surrounded by Japanese Tour Groups also staying at the hotel, but they won't bite and you might even make a new friend. My advice is do not dismiss the Ohana Waikiki Malia by Outrigger when searching for accommodation in Waikiki.","surrey, british columbia","carfaxdave</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>surrey, british columbia</strong>",332,5.0

The price of the hotel is moderate compared with other hotels in Waikiki. That is most of the time my first choice if I look for a hotel. I most say that I think the ""resort/connection fee"" they charged is way to much. The hotel does not have really resort features. The pool is terrible small and not a nice area. It is located between the buildings with no view. No sun loungers. Yes, wifi is ok, but $15 dollars for this, Ridiculous but unfortunately most of the hotel charge this fee now. Service is as you can expect, staff is friendly. Hotel is room is good too. You can see that the hotel is a bit older and it probably needs refurbising in the near future. Double glazing would be a good improvement. We stayed twice here in a fortnight. The first time we had a room at the 18th floor and than the noise of the road is almost gone, but the second time we had a room at the 8th level and this is pretty noisy. As I said, location is OK. On Kuhio, towards the end of Waikiki, so not in the really busy area. 10 minute walk to the beach, shops all around. 5 minutes to a supermarket. Would I stay here again. I am not sure. Maybe yes, but I will look first for an hotel with a comparable price, with a pool in an outside area, without a resort fee and maybe a bit more luxury, although I know I have to pay for this.","Wellington, New Zealand","Bea T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",48,3.0

Noticed 3 male staff in the lobby, no one offered to help with the suitcases. Check in staff (male who checked us in) misdirected my husband to the parking area. He told him to just ""go around the corner and the carpark is just there"". My husband took 30 minutes because there were one-way streets that forced him to reroute and go around several blocks to get back to the hotel. Check-in staff had no eye contact and wasn't very helpful or informative and showed no inititiative when asked simple questions or offered any suggestions. In case you are wondering there is no valet parking, which was expected as it's not a 5-star hotel or anything. Carpark is extremely narrow and you wouldn't be able to take your average pick-up truck in there (due to the narrowness). Carpark attendants were nice but kept thinking we were ""new"" guests everytime we came back from somewhere even after an hour, seemed like no system in place.

Small balcony. Two double beds. Good size room. Little fridge. Very narrow wardrobe. Small bathroom. Housekeeping service was great from friendly housemaid. Booked shuttle service through front desk. Male operator said he would call back to confirm but never did. So 3 days later I went to check at the desk. The female lady assumed we had booked directly with a shuttle company and said we needed to check with the company ourselves. I repeated to her that I had actually booked it through the hotel and was still waiting for confirmation. So she checked their books and reluctantly confirmed they had our details. The pool was closed on saturday night due to a ""private function"" but Im not sure if they offered to use another pool at an alternative hotel because I never bothered to ask. However we weren't informed of this beforehand or at check-in the day before. Paid $650+ including tax (USD) for 4 nights stay. Paid $30 per day for parking. Check-out process was smoother than check-in. Hotel is conveniently located near main strip.

Parking was way too expensive, $20/25 per day and the resort fee that no one even told me about shocked me the most. I just thought that once I had checked in I would of been aware of all the fees but I wasn't which was a bummer to my stay. My hotel happened to be in the end of the hallway which was a good and bad thing. Good because it we didn't hear any foot traffic from the other guest but bad because during the night you can hear everything outside of the hotel. Good thing that I was a deep sleeper but still some nights I could not sleep due to the noise outside. Also, I asked for a non-smoking room but here and there throughout the day and night when we were in our room there will be a strong smell of cigarette smokes. The smell was so bad that it made me not want to stay inside the room at all and also caused some sleepless nights at the hotel. The hotel is at a nice location where it's not far from the shopping centers and beach. That's the only pro that I can say about my stay at the hotel. I wish I can say more but that's the only two that is coming as of now to mind.Just keep in mind you will pay for parking and there is a resort fee that may not be told to you when you check in.

The staff is very customer orientated and amazing with the different cultures that came through. The pool area is small but perfect for a quick dip after being busy all day.

Don't get me wrong, I had an overall good experience at the ʻOhana Waikiki Malia, but there were some things I found that weren't up to par with my expectations, which are pretty average. Here are the pros and cons of this hotel based on my experience there:Pros:1. The location is very good (close to the Royal Hawaiian Center & Waikiki Beach area)2. The Waikiki Connection Fee that is charged to every reservation includes unlimited rides on the Waikiki Trolley for each person with a room key card (just show the room key card to the driver when boarding)3. The IHOP restaurant on the ground level is very good and the service there was great4. There's a room option for three people looking for a room with 3 seperate beds (My party and I were all friends and didn't feel like sharing beds)5. The customer service at the front desk was very good and I felt like we were welcomedCons:1. The room we stayed in had some spots that weren't cleaned too well2. The elevator operation was very confusing at first (the front desk person helped us out though, which was a plus)3. Even though I was told by the front desk that late check-out was available for my reservation, when I called the cashier/cash office they told me that they couldn't offer us late check-out because there was no vacancy at the time (We had a flight later on in the night and wanted to keep our luggage in our room and be able to go back and take showers and things like that; although they did offer us a hospitality room and luggage storage at the bell desk, which made up for the fact)Overall, my experience at the ʻOhana Waikiki Malia was pretty good, and I would recommend it for people looking for family or small-group accommodations who are on a budget or people trying to find a decent last-minute option.","Kailua-Kona, Hawaii","Kauanoeopanaewa A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kailua-Kona, Hawaii</strong>",7,3.0

The Malia is on the corner of Kuhio and Lewers, both very busy streets, at all hours of the day.The room was clean, very large, nicely decorated, with a separate desk and chair to the side. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was small but very clean and adequate.We were given a room on the Kuhio street side on the top (18th) floor. Having lived in Waikiki before, I had high hopes that this would be far enough away from the street noise to get away from the noise at night. Nope!Waikiki is a busy place at night, with lots of people in a party mood, until 4AM. The street traffic runs continually, complete with emergency vehicles, motorcycles and mopeds. Directly across Kuhio is another hotel, equally as tall, that acts as a sound reflector for the Kuhio street noise. All of the rooms facing Kuhio are going to be subject to the street noise.On my second visit to this hotel, I requested a room on the other side, figuring that being away from Kuhio would be much quieter. I was given a room on the 16th floor with a high room number, meaning is was the closest to the Lewers street end. Lewers isn't quiet at night either. At 4AM, people were yelling and screaming in the street.Admittedly, it was a weekend night, but still, I had high hopes of being able to sleep. It wasn't the traffic noise like the Kuhio side, but it was hard to get a night's rest. I wound up turning the AC temperature all the way down to try and block the noise.The hotel caters to a lot of international guests and the lobby staff seems to be very versed in handling Japanese customers. The lobby is small but adequate. Be careful stepping out the front door as the sidewalk has cars driving on it to unload guests. I went out the front door in a hurry only to be startled by a passing car.The hotel has a sports bar off the lobby and there's also an entrance into the IHOP restaurant, located in the same building. Very convenient. The hotel has parking, but you can often find metered street parking if you are patient. After 6PM the spaces are free, but you have feed the meter starting at 7AM, the next morning, unless it's Sunday.A lot of Waikiki hotels are now charging a 'resort' fee. It's a daily charge, added to your room bill. If the hotel was directly on the beach, or had other vacation amenities, a resort fee might be explainable. It seems like they're charging this because the other hotels are doing it. I don't see any 'extra' benefit to warrant the charge.The higher floor rooms, that are opposite from the Kuhio side, have a nice partial ocean view, overlooking the other businesses and buildings in the foreground. In my opinion, the better rooms are the ocean view, lower numbered rooms, closer to the elevator, rather than the Lewers street end. Definately not on the Kuhio street side.","Wailuku, Hawaii","Bob K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wailuku, Hawaii</strong>",48,3.0

Excellent stay. This hotel is in the middle part of Waikiki. Not on the beach. About a block and a half. 10 minute walk to beach. I been to Waikiki many times. This is not a fancy hotel...and...to me..... does not have the greatest views since they are in the middle part and in between other hotels in front, behind etc. But my wife and I were not there for that. I have stayed in beach front hotels in Waikiki in the past.....many years ago.... but found that I was not at hotel enough to justify the cost. Anyway....the Ohana Waikiki Malia has it down perfectly. Great, GREAT.... friendly staff....from the front desk...to the tour promoter (not pushy)....comfortable rooms...excellent cleaning and maintenance room staff..etc. As far as the hotel itself...it is an older building....decor is older....but well kept. Building outside...looks clean...maybe it can use a new paint job! The color seemed kind of dull. Its sort of an off tan/yellow color. Anyway...no biggy. Pool area is almost non existent....but there is a small pool area ground level just past the front desk. Again...not very big. I did not use it. There is also an IHOP (International House of Pancakes) right next to hotel. Same building...and a bar....same building. Again, this is not a beach front hotel...some bar is inside....with no views. But..I did not use bar. But I did go to the IHOP once. All very good. Hotel over all is not too expensive, including the resort fee. (More on that below)....but I felt good about staying there. The one thing I am never happy, EVER, is the so call resort fee....which was $15.71 per day!! NO BUENO!! You'll be told about it when you arrive...and pay when you leave at check out. The fee generally pays for such things as beach towel, Internet access (internet access was EXCELLENT). At all times. I was on the 11th floor...maybe I was closer to the modem. haha! The fee also pays for.... Newspaper, Phone callsIn-room safe In-room coffee. I only used internet and newspaper. You would think the hotel price on the package is it...BUT NOPE!! I really wish hotels include this in the price...but I accounted for this prior to booking so I did not make a big deal. So please be aware that hotels charge extra. Its Hawaii....run by incompetent politicians who pass feel good laws so they get re-elected....so they feel good...but do they do any good? Nope! So.....businesses have to survive. That's my take. Anyway....I stayed for 8 nights so I added $125.68....again...I accounted for this. So the total fee was more than what your final receipt is. This last opinion has nothing to do with the way I felt about the hotel...and my review above...but the fee SHOULD BE PART OF THE PRICE. BTW....bed was comfortable and first time in a long time the pillows where great. For some reason pillows are never quite right for me at hotels. But this hotel...at least my room...was pretty good. I would stay here again...and recommend.","Long Beach, California","Warren G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Beach, California</strong>",14,5.0

Found out a few days before travelling that we had a queen bed & a sofa bed. I hate sofa beds & to me they are for a third person in a room or a child. Certainly not a second bed in a twin bed booking!!! I emailed the hotel with this information & received an email back that she would put a request in to the booking. On arrival we found out we still had the queen bed & sofa bed so obviously no care factor here! We were put into the Luana wing which needs a serious upgrade. I'm not sure we were told there were 2 standards of accom when we made the booking or maybe they just put the Australians in this wing.Room was really dark as there was no window only a frosted window that let in minimal light in the main lounge. There was a balcony off the queen bed room but when seated you were looking at a cement wall & had to stand to get a view of the street. Some street noise from the balcony especially on Fri morning..... unbelievably noisy..... rubbish day maybe?The pool is tiny & didn't even bother to try & get a toe wet in there as it was always packed with young Japanese guests.Breakfast at iHop was great & used the hole in the wall pizza that was good value too. Free transport on the city circle pink line with stops outside the door & the location was good for shops, bars & restaurants.

The fun is all outdoors anyway. And the good parts of this hotel are that it's located just a few walking blocks to the beach, it's reasonably priced, and there's a bus you can ride for free around the downtown area. (The Pink Line- it does not go to the airport or to Pearl Harbor it's just around the shops downtown.)The not so good parts: it's pretty dated- tall people don't really fit in the shower, the bed was very small and the springs were super uncomfortable. The wall AC unit was very loud and when it was off we heard the neighbor coughing and the noise from the city. The pool is about the size of a hot tub. There were unavoidable steps to get to our room (ok we probably could have gotten an accessible room but we didn't think to ask.) I'm really not sure what the $20 resort fee covers but I get that most hotels here charge that extra fee when you arrive.Basically, if the price is right and you're not staying long it's probably ok.

Spacious, clean rooms were reasonably modern, doing their bit to contribute to Waikiki hotels' painfully slow emergence from 1980s style. The biggest annoyance we encountered was at checkin. Our flight arrived very early in the morning and we had queried about an early checkin, which we understood is subject to availability. At 9am, the initial friendly check in gentleman casually said to come back in a couple hours. We returned at about 12.30pm and queried if we could check in, this time with a lady. She said ""your room is ready' but you will need to pay an additional charge if you want it now, but if you wait 25 minutes, you can check in. What was the point of making us wait longer when she said the room was ready? It was overly petty to make us wait.Other than that hiccup, the bellmen and other front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating. I would return to stay here again in the future and just avoid a certain front desk agent.TIPS:- We weren't impressed with the adjacent IHOP, waste of money- Theres a mini pizza joint adjacent to the hotel entrance which makes a decent pie",,RoamingK1w1,42,4.0

I read ALL the reviews and although most were favourable I was a little worried about the noise levels that were mentioned. There was no need!I found this hotel to be comfortable and in the right location. Lobby staff were welcoming each time you walked in and I would like to especially mention Troy (doorman) who helped out several times.My room was on the 8th floor in the Malia Tower. I didn't find the noise levels annoying at all. Yes you could hear the traffic but it didn't keep me awake at all. If you are a light sleeper I would suggest asking for a higher floor.All rooms have balconies - not huge but enough to have a look outside and more importantly, get some fresh air!Although this hotel is 2 blocks back from the beach and there are no 'beach views' - they still provide a handy beach towel service and really a 5 min walk is nothing! I always say 'you only sleep there' regarding a hotel - especially if you are overseas and are out sightseeing and exploring every day.The pool is small... if you want to laze beside a pool in the sun this hotel is not for you. I still used it and had a refreshing swim. The spa is large and very hot! Lovely after a day of hiking... or simply shopping!There is the $15.70 daily room fee which they take off your credit card as a 'hold' each day. All my 'pending' charges were released back to me as soon as I checked out. If you are using a travel credit card just keep in mind these fees are taken out daily.IHOP is adjacent to the hotel and Expedia staff there to book tours etc.Of course there are 'negatives' to this hotel (and every other one) but I chose to look at the positives and I guarantee the positives outweigh the negative :)I would recommend this hotel and stay there again if I return!","Brisbane, Australia","kazzakanary</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",25,5.0

A Food Pantry supermarket is situated 10 minutes up Kuhio Drive (heading towards the Zoo /Aquarium), which is very convenient if you're on a budget and want to make your own breakfasts / lunches. There are several bars and restaurants on Kuhio Drive which vary in price, most are cheaper than eating on Kalakaua Avenue, so the hotel is very well positioned.I found the standard of the hotel to be acceptable, the room was clean and had enough space for the two of us, our view wasn't the best but then this is always a bit of a gamble in Waikiki with all the highrises, unless you're right on the beach. Amenities include an Expedia desk in the lobby, which is great for organizing trips (though you can sometimes get cheaper prices if you book yourself on the web), a small pool, a sports bar (with reasonably priced beer and a happy hour), a small gymnasium, and our stay included free use of the 'Pink Line' tourist bus to Ala Moana Shopping Centre, which we weren't aware of but was a nice addition. The rooms have microwaves so this was good for us as we made our own breakfast arrangements.Even in October, which is supposed to be off-season, the hotel prices seemed to be more than what I would generally pay for this kind of place. But this is Hawai'i, so everything is a bit more expensive than what you would usually pay, and you are paying for location in particular here - it is very well situated, and Roberts Hawai'i shuttles run straight to the hotel from Honolulu Airport, so transfers are pretty easy to arrange.Overall, I would have no problem staying here again on my next trip to Hawai'i, I found the place to be comparable in both price and standard to the competition and found the staff to be welcoming and approachable when we had queries or needed advice on the local area.",,Mark M,55,4.0

We absolutely loved our stay at the Ohana Waikiki Malia. Things we loved the most were 1. The location. The hotel is in the heart of Waikiki, close to Waikiki beach, many restaurants and shops, and there's a city bus stop directly IN FRONT of the hotel, which was so convenient. We took the city bus from the airport directly to the hotel and only paid $2.50 per person. There is also and ABC convenience store on the street corner which sells drinks and essentials at an affordable price. 2. Resort amenities gave us access to the pink line Waikiki trolley which was a great way to get around at no extra cost, beach towels at the front counter was so convenient to pick up on your way to the beach. 3. The IHOP downstairs on the lower level and the Rivals sports bar were both awesome! The IHOP prices were a little expensive but I ordered a kids plate each morning and it was plenty of food for me and saved us money! Rivals has a lunch special $9 for a beer, burger and fries. We loved it. They also had great drink specials and you could pick up your drink and enjoy it at the pool and hot tub (the bar had a pool access door). 4. The hotel offers free luggage storage. After we checked out at Noon our flight didn't leave until 7:10 pm so it was a truly awesome perk that the hotel offers this service so you don't have to haul your luggage around with you all day while you wait to head to the airport. Some other nice details: The hotel staff were friendly and knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions we had. There were fresh flowers to pin in your hair at the counter every single day! Every room has a little balcony (ours was very small but we loved it!). Bottom line for the price we paid for this hotel (a hotels.com ""your special price""). It was a fantastic stay and a pleasant surprise that the hotel was so wonderful. Highly recommend. ",,melanie l,3,5.0

Sort of time machine, you know!Amenities included Hawaiian coffee and unusually pleasant (coconut?) soap, which I still remember to this day.The elevator is a bit funny, but it seems many elevators in USA are like this, from my other experiences.The staff were very friendly and unintrusive, also spoke several languages which was very nice from them.One day there was a police investigation going on the same floor due to a burgled room, as far as I managed to know, which was a bit worrying, because the doors were symbolic and there was not much check on who is going in and out.One thing I remembered were balconies which were tiny, but with great view of Honolulu and mountain range, I enjyed sitting there, eating snacks and looking around.On friday night the noise coming from outside was surprisingly loud, considering the fact my room was at a high floor and all the noise was people chatter outside.","Tokyo, Japan","JaanVisitor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",32,4.0

If you desire an ocean view, you might get one on the upper floors facing the ocean, but don't count on it being a postcard moment. The staff was very friendly & attentive, so they definitely get a 5 star rating! There's nothing to speak of for a restaurant on site, except for a sports bar; however, there are plenty of options withing walking distance from fast food to fine dining. If you're someone who is looking for a pool to use, the one here is non-existent, more of a therapy sized pool on the bottom floor without any view of the outside to speak of.The room was nice, nothing fancy, but a clean, decent sized room to lay your head after a long day of enjoying Waikiki Beach & Honolulu. The biggest issue with the room was it didn't deter much, if any, noise. You could hear outside noise, as well as people down the hallway, at all hours of the night. If you're a light sleeper, make sure you get a room on an upper floor (we were on the 6th floor, which is the lowest floor for rooms) or think twice before staying here. Finally, for being close to most of the action by Waikiki, the hotel is definitely worth a look on a budget. We've stayed at OHANA East also, a few blocks down from this one, & would definitely recommend that one if available.If you're looking for a decent place to stay on a budget, without anything fancy to write home about, this may be the hotel for you, but don't even consider a 5, or 4, star experience.","Rosemount, Minnesota","Dave K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rosemount, Minnesota</strong>",18,3.0

So we chose Ohana Waikiki Malia. It was to be 4 nights/4 people. We were accompanying my elderly parent who needed medical attention. We wanted a kitchenette, 1 bedroom, which we got. However I could not sleep due to the fact that late at night you could smell heavy cigarette, and constant traffic in that section. Hawaiian Air said that it was a prepaid package we could leave but no refund, so we spoke to front desk and she put us on the 17th floor, which would be in the newer renovated Tower, no kitchenette. We took the room. The elevator was card secured. That made us feel safe. We had two queen beds clean and comfortable, a mini fridge, nice bathroom. The only difference was that there was no microwave which we really did not need. We just wanted a one bedroom but that worked. We requested a few things from housekeeping and they were prompt in delivering. We tried the IHop Restaurant which the food and service was good. The room had an awesome view of Waikiki and the ocean and at night the Honolulu city lights. You can walk to Waikiki and public transportation is right across the street.

If it is the first visit to Hononlulu add time to reach the hotel. The hotel is located on a one-way and the elevated parking is on another one-way. Ergo, you have to pull into a slight semi-circle infront of the lobby, drop off the luggage, check in and then circle (a series of right turns once you leave the hotel front, about a six block circle) around the streets of Waikiki to the ramp entrance. The parking facility is cramped but a regular van will fit with a bit of maneuvering. Parking is $25.00 per day and is your best bet. Let's hope they have gotten their elevator crisis cured, because only one elevator stops on the parking lot floors on the way up. The hotel itself is old and basic with the European flare of no flare. A plus to the site is the connecting bar/grill called Rivals. This place had the cheapest beer in town. One door away is an IHop and it serves the usual IHop fare that allows quick in and out. Don't count on using the hot tub, very small, crowded and unattractive.

CONS: No microwave! Have to go down to IHop to have our food heated. Additional info: Resort fee charged everyday (I think it was $15 a day) for pool and spa (tiny pool but why use it when you have waikiki beach?), pink trolley (we made use of this at every opportunity), local calls for 15 minutes (tried to use it once but can't get an outside line, so gave up and used my phone), wifi (their signal is good, at least in our room), and business use (we requested for them to print out our boarding passes and they obliged).

Just spent 4 days on Oahu as part of a longer trip, and stayed at the Ohana Waikiki Malia. We booked this hotel as part of a package deal, through our travel agent and United Airlines. Parking $25 a day, plus a $12.50 additional facilities/connection/resort fee which many hotels in Hawaii seem to tack on.Pros -Good location in the heart of Waikiki, three blocks from the beach.Reasonably priced, very clean, with very polite and helpful staff. Secure parking.Cons -Parking garage ramps and spaces are extremely tight unless you are driving a tiny or subcompact car. Trying to park anything bigger is truly frightening (and I was once a professional driver), especially entry and exit, and will have you wishing you had purchased the comprehensive coverage from the rental agency. We did not use the ground-floor pool, which seemed small. One of the three elevators was not in service for the 18-floor wing, the whole 4 days.Rooms and hallways seemed spartan, decor-wise. Room with king bed was not available to us as a couple. That was our fault, as we should have specified a king when booking. I mention it only because the hotel does not seem to cater to couples that much. The separate beds were comfortable though. Most of the rooms have a small balcony, but don't let your children out there.Rooms have views of either the water or the mountains, but mostly of other high-rises and buildings, given the location. Noise from, and view of, rooftop air-conditioning units of neighboring buildings did not bother us, but might bother those who are sensitive to such things.All in all, we were satisfied with the hotel, since we were intent on maximizing our time away from the premises anyway, to see as much as we could of this beautiful island.

My Wife is amazing at finding deals online, and it is an art to knowing when to jump on a good price for a flight and/or Hotel, and she did both for this trip!We flew Hawaiian and stayed at the Ohana Malia in Waikiki, also rented 2 cars from enterprise... The review on the hotel is somewhat short. It was clean and pretty quite from our room on the 17th floor. U need a key card to go up to the rooms so it felt somewhat safe in the busiest part of Waikiki. We also had parking and that was a tough structure because it is so small and cramped to pull into, but most parking is very limited right in Waikiki.... $25.00 a day. They had a pretty small pool and Jacuzzi. It seemed pretty clean and I am really picky... They had cool Disco lighting for both the pool/ jacuzzi. WIFI only available in lobby, which is whack! so we rented a wireless router for super cheap, and my wife dialed that in too... She's awesome! The hotel also has a Laundry room.

The Pink line trolley, which is included in your room charges, runs throughout the area and up to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre. While they do have free wi-fi, it's not in room and can only be accessed down in the lobby (could we fix that please? Thanks)... you have to use the cable provided in the room and, if you travel with a tablet as I do, you'll be using your own hotspot since most tablets don't have a cable port.The location is FANTASTIC... everything that Waikiki has to offer is either within walking distance or not far from the free trolley stops... and it also stops right in front of the hotel. The hotel staff is friendly, right down to the attendant in the garage. The fee, per day, for guests is $25.00. Word of warning: this is a EXTREMELY tight parking garage... large vehicles, such as the Pathfinder I have this time, will have to have help negotiating the corners on the ramps because they are super tight and just a bit more than car width.I will be back...

The room was clean, tidy and adequate for the time we were there. The location was central to shopping, restaurants and an easy walk to the beach. We spent time in the pool area and made use of the adjoining sports bar. Bar staff were friendly and accommodating too. Wi-if was available in the pool area and lobby. All hotel staff were helpful and friendly throughout our stay. Would recommend this hotel to families who want good value accomodation that don't expect a brand new luxury hotel. Best bit- our room was available for early check in at no extra charge which was a god send after a long flight. Worst bit-very loud in our room from street noise (we were on 5th floor).","Crescent Head, Australia","AmyU76</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Crescent Head, Australia</strong>",5,4.0

We will be staying there again this month for a couple of days and hope to see all of the OHANA there, Front Desk So'o, Alvina, Pam, Junko, Les, Robert, Manny, Amante, and the Bell Staff Peter, Troy, Lance, Brian and the rest of the crew. I've worked in the Visitor Industry over 15 years and have dealt with all kinds of people ranging from very pleasant and happy to be here to I'm the guest and I'm always right. To me that saying is not good because I feel you should always treat a person the same way you want to be treated and we all can live as ONE OHANA! That's why I believe that the ""OHANA WAIKIKI MALIA"" has one of the best staff and crew in it's family. My parents and I always look forward to seeing Troy - Bellmen, he is always so courteous and efficient and apologetic. A couple of times when delivering our bags to the room or pulling the bags from our room he is running a little late and he apologizes and we tell him no problem we understand that it gets busy at times.

Troy also physically assaulted me when I stood up for my wife whe he screamed at her and I stepped in. I asked staff members for the general manager of the Ohana Waikiki Malia, Nora Weatherwax. One moment I was told Nora was on the phone and would get to me regarding what can only be explained as an atrocious behaviour from Ohana Waikiki Malia staff against paying guests, a moment later I was told Nora was no longer there. This lead me to believe that the care factor from the general manager of this outrigger managed hotel was zero.Other aussies, guests and even front desk staff were absolutely shocked when Troy a man standing at five foot ten screamed at my wife who is five foot one. Staff members, Manny and Yuoko at the front desk agreed that it was unacceptable behaviour but still failed to provide any help when it was occurring, like it was an everyday occurrence?After completing a security report of the incident and raising the incident with security and the guest service manager, Mr Castro, nothing was resolved. No plan of action, sincere apology for our experience, or steps on what will happen next provided.I tried to call and email Nora Weatherwax, the general manager for the Ohana Waikiki Malia and Outrigger Hotel but have yet to receive a reply and don't think I will. As a business owner of 3 Australian based media companies I cannot imagine providing this level of service to anyone of my customers and believe that there is a bad side to Hawaii that tourist don't get to see as illustrated by our experience at the Ohana Waikiki Malia.If you're looking to visit Hawaii don't stay at the Ohana Waikiki Malia, if this is the training that is provided to staff by Outrigger who manage several hotel chains, I would try my best to ignore all hotels managed, owned or affiliated with Ohana and outrigger. You are better off spending your hard earned dollars with a more reputable hotel chain that really cares about the service quality provided to guests.What was meant to be a priceless experience was ruined by Troy from the Ohana Waikiki Malia, ignored by the general manager Nora Weatherwax and the processed followed by staff that lacked any care appears to be the training provided by the outrigger group who mind you , claim to be the best hotel service quality providers in all of Hawaii.",,GCFamily7,28,1.0

There are some things that I liked about this place a lot. The location is great - easy walk to wherever you want to go. They have a room type called One Bedroom Kitchenette which the set occupancy is 4 people meaning that you will not get charged additional fees for each person over the first two which is really hard to find. And the set up is just fine. There were eight of us so we only had to get two rooms. There is a big bed in a bedroom and out in the ""living room"" there are two twins. That is a great savings. The people at the desk were also very nice. There is a fun bar downstairs and an Ihop if you need something to eat quickly. There were some things that weren't great. It's not a fancy place and while the rooms were ok, they weren't particularly clean. There were some weird handprint marks all over the wall in our bedroom and you had the sense that really good cleanings didn't happen very often. But it wasn't the worst I've stayed in. The elevators were really bad. Scary even. And the system they have for beach towels was strange. It's great that they have them for you to check out, but you check them out at the front desk (sign a card). We did so and sent our kids off to the beach. When you are by the elevators, there is a box for towel return and so my kids threw them in there because that is what everyone was doing. But I was afraid that we were going to be charged for them because what's the point of the big signout if they don't record when you return them. So, I thought that was confusing and I just now realized I didn't look at my final bill to make sure I wasn't charged for the towels. The parking lot situation is pretty crazy. It is a really tight fit to get in and out of there. Also the little circle in front of the hotel is very busy and sometimes someone parks there so it is impossible to pull in and load people up. I see that some people have complained about the noise. That doesn't bother me. It is to be expected when you are staying in a place like Waikiki. Anyway, this place is in a great location and honestly, I'd stay here again. When we're on vacation in Hawaii, we aren't hanging out in our room. Everyone was very nice and it was affordable.","Aurora, Colorado","AMathews303</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aurora, Colorado</strong>",87,3.0

I gave this place a low rating more on things that are outside the properties control like road noise and what not. But nonetheless it does effect if I'd stay here again (I would not) and so I wanted it to reflect that. Where to start. Noise. We stayed on the 6th floor room 605 and being 6 floors up does not insulate you from the street level noises. You can hear every word of every conversation taking place at 2am. Cars are constance. Maybe a much higher room would get you away from the road noise like in I the high teens but not sure. Room. The room is fine sized for 3 adults. However the bed is very stiff. The bedroom has a queen. In the front room are 2 singles. The front room does insulate you from the street noise so if you must sleep in the front room it does help. However it does not insulate you from the coming and going of the early risers and the door slamming is loud. Cleanliness. The room was decently clean however the bathroom has mild growing in it on the tile and ceiling. This I suspect is mainly do to the fact that there is no fan in the bathroom. The toilet is small by American standards. I think because the bathroom is small and this hotel seems to cater to Asians who are typically smaller people. For a 250lbs guy it's just too small. Therefor the shower is small, a single person only a 3Foot by 3 foot basin. I'd say this hotel is 90% Asian occupants. Parking. Parking is $25USD per day. You can come and go as much as you want. However the beach is just a 10 min walk if Waikiki beach is your thing. Pay more money stay someplace else and you'll enjoy you stay much more.","Oakley, Utah","AruoraKode</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakley, Utah</strong>",34,1.0

Alvina was very pleasant as usual and kept in touch with housekeeping to check when the room would be ready because we were in the lobby waiting. Finally about an hour later she said the room was ready and we could check in. When we got to the room the bedroom had 2 twin beds and also the living room had to twin beds. My parents are not used to sleeping on twin beds so I called Alvina and she said when another room come's available she can room move us. She let us stay in the room to relax and gave us a call when another one was ready. My mom had a doctor's appointment at 2:30p.m. and just before we left Alvina called to say the other room was ready. Before we arrived at the hotel we picked up some groceries for our stay which some of them had to be refrigerated. So, I put them in the frig while we waited but when Alvina called I took them out and just left them on the table so Lance (Bellmen) would know to take them also. When we returned later that afternoon and checked into the room we were very happy. Alvina got everything we wanted as we requested: lower floor, close to elevator, queen bed in room, twins in living room, microwave etc. When I checked if we got everything when Lance room moved our things, I found a note that he had left for us: ""I WASN'T TOO SURE HOW LONG YOU ALL WERE GOING TO BE GONE, SO I PUT THE FOOD IN THE FRIDGE.

I have worked in the airline industry since 2009. So to find a property that offered such a grear rate ($99) per night and all the included amenties was GREAT! So we arrived in the late in the evening due some flight delays, around 10pm or 11pm. Check in was smooth and easy, but to be completely honest we were a little irritable and tired, so quick to get to our room and skip the pleasantries. Upon arriving in our room at ANY hotel I do a quick sweep, like a cleanliness inspection. (I don't care how tired I am, I ALWAYS make time for this. I am not going to possibly contract any illness' while on vacation if I can help it!) So first stop, the bathroom, no mold, pee on the seats, no hairs in the drains. The bathroom was very clean. Next carpet and seating areas, clean to the naked eye, no stains or tears. Then last but not least the BED, ok so this where everything starting crumbling down. I pull back all the sheets and inspect them one layer at a time. The first layer was fine, then the second layer I noticed some hair and dirt..eww. But that wasnt the worst of it. I got to the final layer which had a huge seemingly urine stain and small blood smudge. Disgusting! I immediately called to the front desk to inform them of this. The manager on duty came up and inspected everything with us and sincerely apologized. Because it was so late there was no one from housekeeping to come and do a cleaning. So they decided to put us in another room. By this time it was around 1230pm. So you can only imagine my irritability at this point. This is thw last thing you want to deal with after flying for almost 20 hours, delays, etc. So management finds us another room and has one of the employees check the room thoroughly before we came in. (We waited in the initial room until the new room was ready for us) So we get to new room and once again I do my inspection. Everything turns out to be GREAT! So by the time we were finally settled, showered and in the bed it was around 230pm :-( In the morning I went to the front desk to discuss the previous nights issues. The manager ended up coming 3 of our 5 nights and giving us breakfast vouchers. We were very appreciative and also appreciated that the night staff went above and beyond to assure we were satisfied with our accommodations. Now as far as the amenties, the pink trolley is by far the best! We took that thing everywhere! Its such a money saver to be able to hop on and get around the island for free :-) So even though our experience did not start out on a great note, it ended beautifully.

The room was clean and the a/c worked very well, so the room was a comfortable 70F even when there was 90+F outside. Because you're on one of the busiest streets in Waikiki beach, the rooms are not very quiet.

The most amazing thing about this hotel is the staff! They are the most friendly and helpful people I have ever met! They helped us navigate the streets of Honolulu (most of them one ways), the restaurants and bars, and they were super nice on our last day when we had a very late flight - they carried away our luggage and offered us the hospitality room to freshen up later in the day.Two reasons why I gave it just a 4 star: the noise of the street, and the fact that we booked a king bed room, but they were ""sold out"" of king bed rooms when we got there (how can you be, when we had reservations 4 months in advance?!). We ended up in a 2 full bed room, so we shared a full bed, which seemed even smaller than a normal full bed.

I saw the pool not a big deal since you have the beach a block away and if you really want a pool splurge $ for a hotel on the beach. Location is great. It is close to everything ABC markets, Tsunami Bar and next is a iHop and a short walk down the street is McDonalds Starbucks and lots of other food options.I would recommend this hotel if your solo or a couple and family with teenagers and you dont want to spend $$$.

The newer rooms are slightly smaller, but in both cases the beds and pillows were very comfortable and scrupulously clean.

Our beds were very comfortable and, though the rooms are a little dated, we had an extremely comfortable stay. When we got there, our Internet connection was not working, so we called the desk and someone was there almost immediately and had the problem fixed in less than 5 minutes. Housekeeping was great and even did our dishes for us each day, which we were not necessarily expecting. We loved the location of the hotel...not right on the beach, but close to pretty much everything! The only things that were a little bit annoying during our stay were the lack of wifi, the slow elevators, and the parking garage. No wifi and slow elevators were only minor inconveniences, but the parking garage is, without a doubt, the worst parking garage I have ever seen. Before our vacation, we read reviews that talked about the awful parking garage and we were prepared for the worst, and then it ended up being even worse that we were expecting. It was such a tight squeeze to fit in any of the spots, back out, turn, pretty much anything you would have to do in a parking garage was difficult and miserable. So, if you're planning on renting a car, be aware that it won't be a pleasant experience. Other than that, I would whole-heartedly recommend this hotel.",,hotwheels84,111,4.0

Stayed in the remodeled tower part of hotel. Housekeeping very nice. Front desk staff wonderful and very helpful, My camera died before a wedding, and I asked where I could go to buy a new charger, and they brought out a couple of boxes of chargers that people had left over time and had one that fit my camera (had a very unique charge port). Lifesaving! The hotel is on a busy street, stay up as high as you can for less noise. We only found the noise on Fri-Sat nights to be louder than normal (drunks on the sidewalk) but it wasn't unbearable. The bad thing: no microwave. Really could have used this. We did get a fridge, which should be standard in all hotel rooms today anyways. Food is high in Hawaii no matter which way you buy it, but having a microwave would have helped too. We couldn't see paying an extra $20 a night (minimum) for a kitchenette, so it comes down to spending 100 or more for a few kitchen supplies or eating cold food. Room faced the street at corner of building, so we even got a mountain view, which was pretty. Face it, you're in Hawaii, it's beautiful almost everywhere! Three blocks to the beach, seems a little long because it is not 3 direct blocks to the south, you have to know where to go for the public access points.

We arrived at the hotel after 9:00 p.m. and checked in. We had reserved a one bedroom suite with one queen bed and two twins. Upon arriving in the room, we discovered that the bedroom also had two twins instead of one queen. I called the desk requesting that we be moved to what I had requested, but was informed that they were 100% full and that this was the only available room for that night. However, I was assured that if I checked the next morning they should be able to move us to the correct room. The next morning I checked with the desk and was given a new room assignment when the room was clean. The staff had us pack our suitcases and told us they would move them for us. As it turned out, we had returned from the beach when the new room was clean, so we moved ourselves. Throughout all of the this, the desk staff was amazingly friendly, helpful, and always making sure we were happy with the move. The new room was what we had requested and was some nicer than the first one. This hotel was clean, friendly, and very helpful with every need we had. From moving rooms, to recommending a taxi ride to our destination (and then arranging it!), and from giving directions to getting us part of our luggage the last day so we could use their hospitality room to shower and change....all done with a smile and ""Aloha!"" The service could not have been any better!!! Our room was in the Luana Wing. Our lanai was right on Kuhio Street and on the 7th floor. This wing with the one bedrooms only goes up to the 9th floor. That stated, they are noisy. We didn't notice any room to room noise, but the street noise is loud. I would strongly recommend ear plugs, especially due to the ringing of the trolley bells! I don't quite know why they ring their bells after 11 or 12 at night, but they do and sometimes there was loud cheering after they rang their bell. Rather hard to sleep through at 2 a.m. The room itself was clean, we had good space, the beds were good, our kitchenette was perfect for breakfasts and lunches. We even cut up pineapples and mangoes in it! The small refrigerator worked well, we had a microwave in our room, and the toaster and coffeemaker were a nice touch. We were very happy with our stay after the first night. You aren't on the beach here, but the lower cost was a trade off we were willing to make on this trip. I have read several complaints about the elevators, but we didn't have any trouble at all with ours during our stay. This isn't a five star hotel, but we found it to be a good location, and adequate for what we needed.

It's hard to find a reasonable hotel near the center of Waikiki, but this was a great find!The location is close to DFS, the shopping street (Kalakaua Ave.), famous eateries like Eggs 'n Things, and so much more. Guests can use the pink trolley that goes to Ala Moana Center for free, so that's another plus. The staff are SO helpful. We requested connecting rooms which were completely booked when we checked in, but they were kind enough to search and offered room change since there were openings on the following day. We declined since we were too lazy, but appreciated that fact that they tried to help. The room is okay, maybe a bit on cheap side but you've got all the necessities. The balcony is small, and pool is VERY small so don't expect too much about it. As someone mentioned, the sound proof is not great, you can hear everything going on in the hallway and room next door. We were lucky to not have any issues, since it was off-peak and weren't that many guests staying. However, I noticed during our stay that most of the guests were Japanese, and they are pretty known for their etiquettes so maybe not to worry too much about it? Rental car is a must in Hawaii if you want to travel far, and there is Enterprise Rent-A-Car about 3~5minute walk away on Seaside avenue. Very convenient.

My key notes on this hotel:(1) Only a few blocks down Royal Hawaiian Ave through the Sheraton gets you to a really nice stretch of Waikiki Beach, and the location is quite central to everything.(2) Hats off to the genuinely friendly and helpful staff. (3) Some of the worst sound-proofing I have ever witnessed in a hotel; You hear normal conversation from neighboring rooms as if the people are in the room with you. (4) The ""city view"" just looks out at the unattractive roof of the neighboring buildings(5) The pool and hot tub aren't too appealing as you feel you are in some sort of alleyway, but you are allowed to access the much nicer pools at the other Ohana's!(6) The rooms are clean and comfortable, but spartan. Basic, lino bathroom, etc...(7) No in-hotel breakfast or restaurant/cafe. Your downstairs options are IHOP (Yuck) and the worst pizza ever. At least there's a Starbucks a couple of blocks away, else you'll have to head closer to the beach for decent food. Let's face it, unless you are on your honeymoon, how much time are you going to spend in your hotel room in Waikiki? If you are not looking to spend a lot, this is a reasonable option. My caveat is for light sleepers. I woke up every night just hearing people come into their room next door and talk for a few minutes, at a perfectly reasonable volume.

Although it was free in the lobby, bar, and iHOP, it would have been useful in my room.I also had requested a high floor, as this hotel is located on busy Kuhio Avenue, which has a lot of street traffic and noise.

The staff was friendly and the location is good. However, on our second night, we chose to walk 30 minutes to our car rather than park in hotel garage. The garage has only ONE ramp so you have to hope to not get hit by oncoming traffic. Also, the ramps are terrible. They are so narrow that there are marks all along them from where cars have scraped along the walls trying to make the turns. I parked on one of the upper levels and when I left, my rental car actual scraped the ground when I turned one of the corners. I got out of the car to see if there was damage and there was a dent along the bottom of the car. I then looked at the ground and could see that many other cars had apparently done the same thing.Since the hotel does not manage the garage, I was put in contact with the garage manager who told me that they were not responsible for the damages OR for the state of structure itself. When I pointed out that one of the employees at the garage told me that he does not park on the upper levels because of this issue, I was simply told, ""Not EVERYONE has this issue"".

I had a budget I wanted to work within and I knew we wanted to be in the general area of Waikiki Beach and the International Market Place since that area had all the things we liked to do when we weren't off exporing the island. I ended up doing a blind bid on Priceline and was able to pay a little under $100 per night for the hotel stay. We only had to walk a few blocks to get to the beach so the location was perfect. We had a rental car so we parked on site at the hotel. I wouldn't suggest staying here if you rent a large car, the parking garage is so small that every turn coming in and out was scary. Fortunately we had a midsize car. At check in I asked about upgrading our room, and was told that we could pay $20 per night to upgrade to a city view, higher floor room. Knowing how the street noise can be loud, especially at night when you are trying to sleep, we decided to upgrade. We got a top floor (18th) room and were so happily surprised to see we had fantastic ocean views with a small balcony (room for one chair). Although we asked for a room with two beds because our 21 year old son came with us, I wasn't expecting two double beds, but they proved to be very comfortable and very soft. After a quick call down to housekeeping for some extra pillows and towels, we headed out to the beach. We stopped by the front desk to pick up some beach towels they loan you, and I learned that when you stay at an Ohana hotel, your room key allows you to ride free on the Pink Trolley Line from the DFS mall around the Waikiki area all the way down to the Ala Moana Mall. This was a nice benefit to stay at this hotel. Although I would have liked a larger swimming pool, we ended up just enjoying the beach often since we were so close. They even have a small laundry room to wash your clothes. They gave us change at the front desk and we sat in the laundry room enjoying a beer while we washed up our clothes wihin an hours time. We travel light, so we only bring back packs, so being able to wash our few clothes is important. We also appreciated the independent travel agent in the hotel lobby who referred us to another independent company a few blocks away when she didn't have any discounts for Germain's Lua. We ended up saving almost $60 for three tickets to the highly rated lua. Overall the room was clean, comfortable, had coffee and refrigerator, great views and quiet A/C for a great price in a great location. Will definately come back!","Ann Arbor, Michigan","lisaviva</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ann Arbor, Michigan</strong>",39,4.0

Rooms were clean and pretty new. Had a few nice touches that weren't expected, like having plumeria & orchid flowers to pin in your hair at the front office. Cons: Elevator system is frustrating. It is really odd and inconvenient (you have to swipe your key card, as other reviewers have described) and there are some elevators which only go to the rooms, and the others which go to garage and rooms. Weekend nights saw security asking for key cards. Have to ""check out"" beach towels from the front desk, which made getting towels less convenient. Some room components, like the curtains, felt a little cheap, but this is a value hotel you choose for clean, convenience. Swimming pool felt like it was located in the back alley, but being so close to the beach, who wants to swim in a pool anyway, and there are the other pools at the sister hotels (Ohana East & Ohana West) which are maybe 5-10 mins walk away.Parking $20 per day, going rate for the area, parking garage is pretty scary to drive around.

My 17th floor room in the main building (Malia Tower) was reasonably quiet and as comfortable as could be. All the ""standard"" rooms are in the Malia Tower and all have been renovated. But if you pay more for a 1 bedroom unit, you'll be in the infamous unrenovated Luana Wing - don't!I have to agree with the previous reviewers about the lack of TV channels. As you can see from my profile, I have traveled around the world to many continents and have never ever stayed in a hotel with fewer TV channels, at least not in this century. Even in countries like Cambodia, Thailand and Laos, I could receive CNN and other cable news channels. I have stayed in many other budget hotels in Waikiki and had no complaints about the TV channel lineup either. This is the only hotel where there is no CNN (no, HLN is not CNN), no MSNBC, no CNBC, no Weather Channel, etc. etc. At home these channels are part of my ""basic"" cable service so I don't understand why Ohana accepts anything less.The other issue is the crazy elevator system. In the Malia Tower, only one of three elevators stops at floors 2-5. There are no independent call buttons, however. So if you're going down to the 5th floor to use the guest laundry, for example, the odds are 2 to 1 that the elevator you called won't be the one that stops on these lower floors. Many guests seem hopelessly confused by this arrangement which could be rectified if Ohana would install a separate call system for the elevator that services the garage and laundry floors.

AAA has it correct when it says 2-star because I can give no fathomable explanation for how travel sites are rating this location as a 3-star hotel. The only positives about this hotel that I can mention is it only two blocks from Waikiki Beach, we got a great rate on the room, and the air conditioner drowns out all the street noise.At arrival, there is no noticeable entrance to park your car to unload and check-in. It wasn't until the next day that I noticed you drive onto the sidewalk area when you check-in. The parking garage is trecherous with a single, steep entry/exit ramp that only allows a single car regardless of direction of travel. We had a standard sized car and could barely fit in the parking spaces. There is only one elevator from the garage and you have to go to the lobby prior to being able to go to your room. Going back to the garage is also a chore since, once again, you go to the lobby, then only one elevator goes to the garage but it takes you through the unrenovated wing and then climb three stairs, and open a door before you're back at the garage.If that's not bad enough, we get to the room and our internet is not working. I call the front desk for assistance and they refer me to an 800 number. I asked for them to send someone up or move me to room with working internet and they refuse, saying that the internet is contracted through another company. Of course the first thing on my list of vacation plans is to call tech support to walk me through a problem that I didn't create. Luckily I know enough to reset the room modem but I still had to pull the dresser away from the wall to reach it. Great customer service!The beds were lumpy and the pillows felt like they were made of foam. The room also had a musty smell but at least the bathroom was remodeled. The maid was friendly but it was hit or miss with other employees. Some were friendly and polite, but others acted like they were bothered when questions were asked.

Before booking, we turned to tripadvisor (like always) and, given all the good reviews, we were pretty confident in our selection. Our confirmed reservation was for a king sized bed on floors ""14-18."" Upon arrival, the front desk tells us that they do not have any king beds available, and that it is Ohana's policy not to guarantee specific bed sizes. We were offered either a queen or two twins. We took the queen, and weren't at all concerned, so what if we didn't get a king we thought. Big mistake. Apparently this hotel has both newly renovated rooms and nonrenovated rooms. We were put into one of the nonrenovated rooms on the 10th floor. We got off the elevator, and spent a good 10 mins searching for our room. There was a sign with our room number on it, but when you opened the door it lead to a stairwell. After a bit of trial and error, we realized you had to go through the stairwell,. into a second stairwell, and up a few steps into an older building that really is more of a motel than a hotel. All of the rooms open on to a main outdoor walkway, like you'd see at most motels, and they all share one balcony on the back...meaning that any of your neighbors can walk right up to the sliding glass door of your room. The rooms look like they were last updated in the 70s, smelled of must and mold and had mysterious stains on the carpet and curtains.When we went to the front desk to see if we could move rooms, or upgrade if necessary, we were told that the renovated rooms were rented at the same rate as the one we had, and that they'd gladly move us for no charge except that they had literally just rented the last renovated room. They couldn't seem to answer the question of why we were put in a non-renovated room when we checked in, especially since our reservation specifically confirmed that we'd be on floors 14-18 (the non renovated rooms are only on the first 10 floors).We asked about a reduced rate, or partial refund and were denied. The best they could do was put us on the waiting list for a new room the next day. Luckily, a room opened and we spent the second night in a MUCH nicer room. The renovated rooms are really nice, and I can understand why they get such great reviews here. And aside from the fact that we were put into a crappy room, the staff was all really nice and helpful, so I guess the place has potential.But I can't give it any higher than 2 stars because having seen the difference between renovated and unrenovated rooms, I find it unconscionable that they are apparently rented out at the same price.

If you're going to the mall, make sure you take the Express bus else you'll be looping around picking up others first before heading out there. Loved the food court at the Ala Moana mall and picking up juice and milk at Foodland on the lowest level. We stayed on the 11th floor and didn`t hear a lot of noise other than on the Friday night. Getting in and out of the parking garage is very tricky: steep and sharp curves. I would recommend parking a block or two away at one of the public parking lots which charge from $5 to $10 for a 12 hour period on Kuhio Avenue. Front desk staff were pleasant: need to sign out beach towels so make sure they acknowledge that you`ve brought them back else you`ll be paying for them. Stored our luggage until 6 pm and even offered us the use of a freshup room with shower (ran out of time otherwise would have been nice). Will definitely go back (don`t bother going to the IHOP downstairs for food: expensive for what you get).Beach at Hilton Hawaiian was the nicest beach, with paddleboat, kayak, umbrella and chair rentals for a reasonable price (I think it was $20 for 4 hours or $30 for the day until 5 pm). Ate at the Rainbow Drive-in (about 10 minutes away by car) several times: nothing fancy but huge portions. Safeway was also about 10 minutes away. Tried Waiola and Matsumoto shaved ice; Dole Pineapple plantation dole whip: kids loved it. Leonard`s bakery had a huge lineup. So did Giovanni`s shrimp truck but service was fast (use coupon from tourist brochures to get a free soda can).","Sooke, Canada","Likestotravel11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sooke, Canada</strong>",15,5.0

Staying at an Ohana Hotel gets you free rides on the Pink Line of the Waikiki Trolley, which seems undeservedly very popular. There are many restaurants within a few blocks and shopping areas abound. The main reason to stay here is that you get more than you pay for. The rooms compare with any you would find at a high-end property but at a relatively bargain rate.

It's location is ideal for the The Bus and the Waikiki Trolley and is only a few blocks from the beach. If you are like me and don't spend much time in your hotel, the Malia is a good option. I just needed a place to sleep, wash, and store my clothes that wasn't a total dive. I liked how you needed a key card to get use the elevator. They have a front desk and security men to make their presence known, but that extra bit of security made me feel good - especially since I am a solo female traveler. I was on the 14th floor and the street noise was still pretty loud. I'm the type to find the continuous sounds of the street to be relaxing, but if you need silence, then I'd avoid the city view option. Small complaints: 1. Most of the TV stations were either the 24hr loops of tourist stuff, 24hr news, or in Japanese. That was fine for most of the time, but sometimes I'd want to wind down at night with a good TV show, and I'd have just 3 options on most nights - something on CBS, PBS, and the news. It would have been nice to have more channels. 2. The cleaning staff would get to my room at odd times. Sometimes they'd knock as early as 9 and then other times they'd come as late as 2pm. I'd suggest putting your privacy tag on your door whenever you're in there to avoid random knocking when you're sleeping in or just trying to get out of your swimsuit to get ready for a little shopping. Just don't forget to take it off on the way out. 3. The internet was supposed to be high-speed, but it was very slow for me. I tried to watch Netflix because of complaint #1 and it would stop every 2 minutes and then take almost 10 minutes to reload. I would definitely stay at the Malia again. The hotel is not amazing enough to make me a loyal client, but I'd certainly suggest it to others and/or stay here again, especially if they had the $79/night deal again.","Honolulu, Hawaii","AdiaLynette</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",6,4.0

The next day, they had a king room for us and we moved over and it was much more to our expectations. The beds were very comfortable, the rooms were standard size and very clean. It was also in a very good location, just a couple blocks from the shops and nightlife, so we were right in the middle of it so we did not need a car. We used the free Pink Line Shuttle our first night to get around, but really didn't need to. We did rent a car from down the street for a day to visit Pearl Harbor and the North Shore. Our only problem was the Internet was not working in the room, and after spending a half hour on the phone with a tech support person, I gave up - I did not want to waste time with it, so that was not good.

It is within walking distance to the beach, and you get free transportation on the Pink Line, with your room key. The staff was unbelievably nice, and friendly. On our last day, our flight did not leave until 9:15 p.m. The staff put our bags in a secure room, after we checked out at noon, so we could go spend our last day at the beach. They even let us use their beach towels. On top of that, they let us use a room when we got back from the beach, to get cleaned up, and change clothes. Very nice. The rooms are small, but very nice. There was even a small balcony on our room. I could her a little bit of noise, later at night, probably as the bars were letting out.

For a very reasonable price (about $125 per night plus tax paid in advance) we got a modest suite with a living room with TV and two single beds plus a double bedroom. Simple kitchen facilities, a modest bathroom and a balcony. It may have been more motel standard than hotel but to be honest we were hardly in the room. We didn't use the pool at the neighbouring Ohana properties but we did get beach towels to use on the beach which is only two blocks and a 15 minute stroll away. We got free use of the Pink Trolley by showing a room key - make sure you get one for each member of your party.No breakfast provided but there's an IHOP on the premises. It was probably a bit expensive but there was a McDonalds a few yards away and some other local restaurants offering breakfast deals at around $3.99. For dinner there's a massive choice nearby but we used the food court in the Royal Hawaiian centre a few times.There are some questions in earlier reviews about street noise. Our room was on the 7th floor on the corner overlooking Kuhio Avenue and although I 'm reasonably sensitive to noise, we didn't have any problems although, clearly, the road is busy late into the evening. I guess rooms lower down the hotel may be different but my advice is to turn up the aircon to create some white noise to block it out.I expected the criticisms of the car park to be an exaggeration especially when you consider the generous size of the average American parking garage. However, it is definately a tight squeeze and would not be out of place in somewhere like Belgium. The up ramp is steep witha tight left hand turn - quite a worry when driving a rental. The turn into the upper floor is seriously sub-standard. Its not impossible though so take your time. There was an attendant on site all the time. I have no idea how some of teh larger SUVs got in there!Good place to rent a car is Dollar which is a few blocks up Kuhio. You coudl rent at 9am and return by 8pm to avoid teh need to incur overnight parking charges. Otherwise the City Bus is great if a bit slow. We used it to get to Pearl Harbour and Hanuma Bay without any problems and for only $2.50 each - get a transfer to use on the return journey.The City Bus and Pink Trolley go to Ala Moana Mall which has a serious food court and a massive choice of shops.Desk staff were really helpful and booked us a taxi to the Airport on the last day. Taxi costs about same as Shuttle for 4 people ($36).- a bit more with a tip. NB the City Bus would be cheapest but (officially) doesn't allow luggage that can't fit under the seats.All in all this was a great choice. No frills but clean and friendly. Not a premium location but well placed for shops rastaurants and transport links. Remember you're here to spend time on the beach not in the hotel.

If you absolutely MUST be right on the beach or have immediate access to a swimming pool, this isn't the place to be. BUT if you want to save $$$ and don't mind walking (or taking a free trolley) a couple of blocks to the beach or walking 2-3 blocks to one of the other Ohana properties for the pool, this could be the place for you.We actually stayed here at the beginning and end of our trip... the first night was in a room with a connecting door (1407?) and found that the door was not well sound-insulated and let a fair amount of noise through. The last several nights were in a room (1427) that did not have a connecting door and was at the end of the hall -- making it very quiet overall.Pros:- Great price for the location- Clean and well-maintained. We had some trouble with the wired internet connection in our room and they immediately sent their technician up to our room to repair it.- The Waikiki Pink Line Trolley is VERY close by and they provide free access to this trolley by just showing your room keycard. For those that want to get around the local spots in Waikiki, this is a VERY cost effective bonus. We saved big $$ by not having to buy a multi-day trolley pass or have a rental car. The Pink trolley route forms a ""figure 8"" and the Malia is located near the center -- making it fairly easy to go either direction without too much hassle or delay.- Staff was VERY helpful... we could store our bags after check-out for no charge. And they even let us use one of the rooms to get cleaned up and changed before catching our flight -- more than 7 hours AFTER we had checked out.- Free wired internet in the rooms and free local calls as wellCons:- Not a 4 or 5 star property from an amenities point of view... but we were rarely there anyway. The room was cool, clean, and comfortable and it had a small fridge.... which was basically all we needed.- No pool directly on the property... but they have an agreement with other Ohana properties to allow free use of their pools -- so why pay the price for the higher-end properties when you can walk a couple of blocks and use their pools for less?- A few blocks to the pool... but you can walk it or use the free access to the trolley- The IHOP restaurant directly attached to the restaurant is very $$$ although convenient. We chose to go a 1 block down to a small bar that served great breakfasts starting at $3.95 and grabbed some GREAT steak meals to go from HI Steaks located in the Food Pantry only 4-5 blocks away.... plus there are other restaurants that will give you more experience/quality for your money.","Seattle, Washington","NomDePlume00</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",113,4.0

On both nights we were greeted politely, and given rooms in the tower with interior hallways (they have a building with exterior hallways, which I suspect is the older section). The tower we stayed in was newly rennovated and if you look at the pictures on their website, it looks EXACTLY as it is depicted. The counter tops in the bathroom and the little reception area is granite. There was a small coffee pot and a small refrigerator for our use. Computer ethernet was free without hassles of using their password to get on. Our first night there we were on the street side, but the downside of being in the middle of Waikiki is the street noise on a Friday night. We were exhausted by the end of the day, so once we fell asleep, it wasn't a problem. The beds are very comfortable. We had time to walk Waikiki, see most within walking distance and sample a restaurant down the street. It was raining hard when we checked in, and they provided umbrellas for us upon request. My Dad is retired from the Military and we were given a 50% discount on the parking, from $18 to $9, once he showed us his card. The parking garage was an interesting joy ride going up or down since it was on a very steep grade, and very hard to maneuver due to small spaces. My only complaint was the impersonal female desk clerk when we checked out. I wanted to make sure the parking was charged correctly, and she gave me a strange look. Then she proceeded to check us out without making further eye contact. On our return trip back, we were given the same warm reception both at the beginning and the at check out. This time we had a distant ocean view, the noise level was about the same. Oh, one last thing. We had decided on our second night to take the breakfast package for the attached IHOP - an additional $20 per room. The wait was long, and we were not given a choice from the menu: eggs, pancakes or toast, sausage or bacon and coffee. Juice is an additional charge and there are no substitutions. A better deal was the restaurant down the street where we could have gotten the same breakfast for $3.99. We had sampled their dinner special (steak and fish) for $9.99, and it was decent. I would have rather sampled their breakfast there instead. The food at IHOP was good and the waitress we had tried to please. Overall, we would stay there again any time we stop on Oahu!

I stayed at the ohana Malia for one night before moving to a larger hotel for a high school reunion. This hotel is located in the middle of Waikiki.

It was only a 3 block walk. After spending the afternoon at the pool and having a maitai at the pool bar, I walked back to the Malia, stopping for a plate lunch of Terriaki steak to bring back to my room. Since i was tired from the flight, I took a shower, ( hot water, strong shower, nice soaps and shampoo), ate my plate lunch, watched a bit of TV, (many chanels),and called it a night at 8pm.The Ohana Malia is a place I can recommend for anyone.

I found a good rate for like $70 something and with the taxes, it was a little under $100. I booked it for the same day (and they totally accomodated and didn't give me any fuss) got there and it was SO nice. Everything was clean and I had a small terrace overlooking the city (gorgeous). Also, when I checked out the next day (check out is at noon--I didn't even know hotels had that late of a checkout), I could keep my luggage with them while I went and parasailed & surfed. I wasn't even staying the next night! And they didn't charge me a dime for this. Furthermore, when I got back from surfing, I looked like a train-wreck and the staff let me use a ""hospitality room"" where I could shower and change before my flight at 10 pm. WHO DOES THIS?! It was like kindness out of their hearts. When I go back to Hawaii and do it the right way, I'll def be staying at this hotel!! Oh yeah, and the staff helped me get to the airport in the least amount of time so I wouldn't miss my flight.","Boston, Massachusetts","Ugandabekiddingme</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",1,5.0

My overall experience staying in the hotel was great. I think one must be aware of what are the available amenities provided by the hotel first, before doing the booking.I will tell prospective bookers that:1. The hotel's carpark is limited and cramped, although the carparking attendant is doing their level best to make the overall experience as pleasant as possible, given the physical contraints imposed by the carpark design and space. They do valet parking to minimise inconvenience.2. There is no swimming pool situated at the hotel, but hotel guests can make use of pools from its sister hotel (Ohana East or West). Just need to have a 5 minutes walk to enjoy the pool.3. There is no gym, but Waikiki is great for outdoor activities and jogging, so its not a big deal.4. There is no restaurant although there is an IHOP just next to it, as well as many other eateries situated nearby along Waikiki.5. The ""high-speed"" in-room wired broadband is free to hotel guests, but the speed is dependent on the number of users, i.e. the more users there are, the slower the connection speed will be. But one can still access the internet. Besides that, there is free WiFi access at the lobby for hotel guests to use.6. The hotel provides 15 minutes free outgoing calls to anywhere in CONUS (inclusive of Hawaii) and Canada, which I thought is great.7. There is adequate security at the hotel, especially in the late hours. A security guard will check for hotel guests' key card to validate, and the lifts to the hotel rooms require the key card to activate and use.8. The lifts can be a tad slow (in terms of waiting time) at times, especially if there are a lot of guests staying at the hotel. They are probably the most abused and used equipment in the hotel.All in all, I am glad to have stayed at the Ohana Malia. Yes, its not a 4 star hotel but it provides a clean and friendly place to stay. I will certainly go back to the Ohana Malia to stay again when I next visit Hawaii.",Singapore,"Harry T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",32,4.0

Its steep, and not wide enough to even fit a car, you can see on the walls how many people have banged it. Everytime i had to reverse so i could make the turn. Let alone i had to go up so many levels because there was no parking on the first 3 floors. If you have a middle sized car or a van or truck, FORGET IT! i came so close to banging the wall everytime i went in or out. Another thing that i disliked was the security. During the night time, there would be a security guard having to check our ID's and asking what room were in. I just wanted to go up to my OWN room that i payed for withoug feeling like im being accused of something.

Personally I love the diversity. MOST of the time when traveling for pleasure I try and cut down on my cost (hotel & car) so I can use my dollar’s for other more ‘interesting’ things. This trip was no different, although it was a VERY special for me and I wanted to try a combo pack - so I booked the Ohana Malia for the first 3 nights and another hotel that is rated much higher on Trip Advisor (Top 5) for the last 3 nights. I do not want to give away what hotel it was because the hotel and especially the staff were phenomenal and the hotel has earned the right to be at the top of the trip advisor list. For me staff plays a minor role in the overall experience of my stay. I GENERALLY have very little interaction with the staff and when reading reviews tend to dismiss remarks both pro and con about hotel staff. If I would have known in advance how nice this hotel was I would have just stayed here the entire trip and never moved hotels to my ‘upgraded room’Things to know:Parking at most all hotels in Wakiki is extra so make sure you factor that in when you are booking your room. This hotel is no different although two blocks away there is free parking on a major road called the Ala Wai. But be careful - on two days of the week there is no parking between certain hours and if you do not read the signs then your car will be towed. You will also have to make the block a few times because parking can be hard to find.There are night clubs near by and depending on what side of the hotel you are on if you have the window open to let in fresh air you will be able to hear people getting there drink on. But most hotels are like this on Wakiki, the weather is amazing so people are out and about enjoying it.","Kuta, Indonesia","kungFUgrip</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuta, Indonesia</strong>",6,4.0

The hotel is nice,newly renovated, clean and great location,personally. There is an IHop at the hotel if your into that kind of thing, a McDonalds, Starbucks, L&L BBQ,Int'l Market among other things are within a block. The beach is 3 blocks away walking down Lewers St. Short walking distance to the Outrigger Reef for their $ 3.00 Mai Tais....Excellent! ( 12-5 only )Free ride on the Pink Line trolly which you can catch behind the hotel. All the bus stops are on Kuhio which is where the hotel is located. My friend and I actually walked/hiked from the hotel all the way to the top of diamond head and walked back the other way around the crater towards the beach side and ended up on the main street which is Kalakaua Avenue and back to Kuhio Street to the hotel. It was around 7 miles round trip but an easy walk. We did this twice and left at 5:30am and got back to the hotel close to 10. Excellent trail and view in the other side of diamond head towards the light house.Our room was big and clean. Small balcony but can't complain. There was a small opening in the horizon between 2 buildings where you can see the ocean and the sun literally set right in between. Our room number was 1019. Also free wi-fi but in the lobby ony which was fine with me.The things that I didn't like much is the slow elevators. Somehow,they take forever but I guess why rush, your in Hawaii. Also, there is not much channels on the tv but who stays in their room in hawaii on a vacation? The worst thing I can say about this hotel is that it does get loud in there. It seems like the walls are very thin. We can hear all these girls next door laughing,talking. The front door is a little too high off the ground, so you can hear the noise from the hallway. Especially all the drunk party people who are just coming home at 2-4 in the morning. Fortunately for us, we heard if only 3 times out of the week we were there.I would totally recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a very reasonable rate with a great location, clean and comfortable room. Also, you can use the pool of their sister hotels like the Ohana East, Ohana West and the Ohana Beachcomber. We went to the latter one. Pretty good size, lots of lounge chairs, right on the main strip with a Jimmy Buffet bar/restaurant on the spot. We had a great time. Can't wait to the next one!

It is just within a few minutes walk from the Waikiki beach, and there are many shops, cafes and restaurants around. Right next to the hotel there is a bus stop, frequently serviced by a handful of routes that will take you virtually anywhere for just $2.25: to the downtown Honolulu, Pearl Harbor, O'Ahu botanical gardens (I would especially recommend visiting Koko Head garden and Ho'omaluhia botanical garden), Sea Life, Waikiki Aquaruim, Diamond Head crater, Sunny Beach or wherever you wish to go. And yes, you can take bus routes 19 or 20 from and to the airport. 4 day unlimited bus pass is $25 and is available at all the ABC stores.The hotel is very clean and safe (moreover, the rooms have digital safes for your valuables and documents, just to make you 100% sure everything is secure and ease your mind), the staff is helpful and friendly. They offer wired internet access in the rooms — you might think a wireless solution would be better, but their internet is way faster than the wireless I saw in other places. And there will be a patchcord for your convenience if you don't have yours.If you, like me, are worrying about bedbugs and suchlike, which is not unheard of on Hawaii, rest assured: there are none here. I have not seen a single insect of whatever kind during my whole stay at any place in Waikiki Malia. In your room you will find a coffee machine which can brew you 2 or 3 full cups (4 if not filled to the brim) of local Hawaiian coffee (1 filter bag provided daily, so are cups, sugar etc). You will also get a small fridge to store your drinks and snacks if you so desire.Sleeping is Waikiki Malia is a pleasant experience, though I personally had a few days in the beginning of my stay when the winds were very strong in the nightime, so the balcony door gave knocking sounds, being a bit loose in its frame, when a surge of wind came by. I solved that by simply tucking one of the many towels provided in-between the door and its frame and slept like a child on a large soft cosy bed.If you don't know what to do in the evenings, you'll have an HD TV set in your room, so you can watch local TV for free. There is a couple of hotel channels as well, broadcasting video reports about different places and activities around the island. I found that useful and followed a couple of their recommendations.Unfortunately, as I was travelling alone, I could not qualify for a free breakfast program. If you will go with someone, you will be eligible. But still, there are a lot of places to eat around, from McDonalds and Subways to nice restaurants, so that is not a problem. As for me, I was fine with my morning coffee alone; after that I used to buy a bottle of water or a vitamin beverage and go around the island (don't forget to have water with you on Hawaii at all times, you can start dehydrating even before you notice).Waikiki Malia does not have a pool, but neighbouring OHANA hotels have, and you will be welcome there free of charge. If you will have some time during your last day of stay, they will let you take a shower even after you checked-out, so don't hesitate to have your last dip in the ocean. And they will also store your bags for you before you go.I have not checked it myself, but the OHANA key card should let you ride at least the pink line tourist trolley for free.","St. Petersburg, Russia","nesh48103</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Petersburg, Russia</strong>",13,5.0

No, they are not 5-star hotels - so don't go with the expectation that they are. But they are a modestly priced chain, with clean, comfortable rooms, and friendly, competent staff.The Waikiki Malia is in a good, central location in Waikiki - just one block north of popular Kalakaua Ave, and about 4-5 blocks from the beach. It was a pleasant 10-15 minute stroll from the hotel to the beach every day (shorter or longer, depending on how many times you veer off into a store to shop along the way :) The rooms are a nice size, and comfortably furnished. Ours had a mini-fridge which was great to store snacks and drinks, and we had a small lanai for fresh air. Granted, the lanai was small - but it was nice to step out there now and then to check the weather and see the traces of sunrise or sunset. A big bonus about the room was the free wired internet. Internet access is one of my top amenities when I travel, so it was much appreciated. Another nice amenity is the access to the Waikiki Trolley pink line, which we used to take a trip to the Ala Moana shopping center, but you could hop on/off at multiple stops around Waikiki. You can get a free ride just by showing your Ohana room key. The front desk staff was extremely pleasant and helpful, as they always are in the Ohana chain. We also enjoyed the ""welcome gift"" we received, which was a small drawstring backpack that we used every day when going to the beach. All in all, the Ohana chain can't be beat. When I go to Hawaii, I'm there to soak up the sun and relax on the beach, as well as shop a little bit. I'm rarely in my hotel room, so I don't need alot of frills and an expensive room, which is why Ohana is perfect for me.Mahalo, Ohana!","Fort Worth, Texas","BethanieKay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Worth, Texas</strong>",302,5.0

Then staff that had greet us were very pleasant and also the staff that cleaned our room. I highly recommend Ohana Malia if your traveling on a budget.

The staff was as rude as you could get, none of them knew what was going on and the breakfast we received was worse than lousy crap.

The trip was booked through American Airlines Vacations which really let me down which suprised me because American is such a great airline. Our room was awful we were promised a one bedroom suite with 3 beds (one bedroom and a room with two twin beds) and it included one bed in a small room with no tv and another small room with a barely working tv with two uncomfortable day beds. The paint was chipping, doors were broken, balcony had all the comfort of a parking lot, doors and items were covered with rust, dirty disgusting capeting, moldy smell, beddings that looked and smelled 40 years old and a shower you didn't want to use. The hotel is a rundown mess. The only people that might it enjoy it our college students with no money and just want a place to sleep at night and don't care about being in a dump because they are drunk, which is the only condition you can endure this hotel. It was torture. Even the halls and elevator were run down and ugly.The manager did try and set us up at another hotel but it would have cost us extra which we had not budgeted for, and we thought at $240 a night we were going to get something not fantastic but at least descent and not a flop house.I always like to read the reviews on Trip Advisor first, but I thought I could trust AA Vacations I was wrong, very wrong. And of course AA Vacations when we arrived and complained they were unable to help because the office was not open and almost a month later have not responded to my complaint about my trip. So you would want to double and triple check any AA Vacation hotels, it would probably be better to go with Priceline, which has never disappointed me and always surveys me afterwards to find out how my experience was, you can probably guess AA Vacations does not provide surveys about your experience and after you pay your money they are pretty much done with you. As I mentioned this is sad because my experience with American as an airline has been great, but as far as hotels check Trip Advisor and use Priceline. It's extra sad because the trip was a Christmas present for my mother who always wanted to go to Hawaii and truly AA Vacations drop the ball and even after finding out they did such a poor job and has done nothing.",los angeles,"ShawnGrifLA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>los angeles</strong>",3,1.0

We travel to Hawaii nearly every year. This was the first time we have stayed at this hotel, though we have stayed at an Ohana brand hotel before.Our room--1516--had lots of problems. The air conditioner in that room is about to die, as evidenced by the constant loud rattle of the fan. We didn't use it much because it was so noisy, and it had a bad odor. The carpet is very worn and stained. The refrigerator door is hanging by one hinge and must be lifted to get it to close. We also didn't use the dresser drawers because they were disgusting. When we notified the front desk, we were told the brown, smeared stains were ""paint."" It looked quite a bit like something else, and the drawers were musty-smelling. The entire room was dusty. My parents were staying in the room next door, which had an OK carpet, a nice refrigerator, a working and quiet air conditioner, but still musty in the dresser drawers.If you like to sit on the lanai, stay elsewhere. The Malia's lanais are so tiny you can't even get a chair out there. The Malia is on Kuhio, a busy, noisy street. If noise bothers you and you choose to stay here, bring earplugs or buy some at the ABC Store across the street. The Malia is a long walk to the beach and has no pool. You can use the pool at the Ohana Maile Skycourt, Ohana West or Ohana East, though these hotels are as far away as the beach and their pools close early (8 or 9 PM depending on the hotel). We didn't even take the time to look at the available pools.We used the laundry facilities at the Malia. The washers are fine. It costs 2 dollars to wash. The dryers cost $1.50 to dry, but the inefficient dry cycle is only about 25 minutes, so it actually cost me $4.50 to dry a half load of lightweight cotton clothes. The laundry is on the 5th floor of a very dark, deserted garage that is open to the public. Kind of scary.The good things: Front desk staff was fine. For most of our stay the housekeeping staff did a good job and was pleasant. (We did have one fellow for a day or two who did a really lousy job.) Free daily coffee for the in-room coffee maker and free daily newspaper was much appreciated. Free rides on the Pink Trolley is a useful perk. Rooms are large for Waikiki, with a real bathtub in the bathroom instead of just a shower.

The room was on the small side, but clean and fresh, with fairly comfortable beds. The six dresser drawers were pretty nasty, however; only one was clean enough to use. The bathroom was a nice size, with good water pressure and constant hot water. Nice central air conditioning (although the cover plate for the controls was missing; instead, it was labeled with a sharpie: Hi, Lo, Off). Very small lani (balcony) without any furniture (only 1 small chair would fit anyway). The biggest drawback are the very thin walls and windows. Heard all the noises on the street from our 11th floor room (facing Kuhio Ave.). Even worse, you can hear every sound from neighboring rooms, from toilets flushing to alarms going off. Not to mention guests socializing in the hallway all night long and the endless slamming of doors. Most of the guests seem to be either young party people or military, at least over the 4th of July holiday. The location is great, maybe a 10-minute walk to the beach (if you go thru the Waikiki Sheraton). City buses and the Hilo Hattie trolley are right outside the door; other trolleys are right around the corner at the DFS Galleria. Extra charges: parking garage was $15 a day, $3 a day to use the room's safe, $2 if you use the supplied bag of kona coffee. There was a free newspaper outside your door each morning. The front desk provides you with beach towels (which are actually just the same small bath towels that are in the bathrooms). There is a newly opened IHOP restaurant adjacent to the hotel, recently converted from the old Malia Cafe. Nice, new decor, very crowded for weekend breakfast. Overall, not a bad place to stay when you can't afford those expensive beachfront resorts.","Orange County, California","JerrGell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County, California</strong>",66,3.0

The room was dirty, the curtains were stained from smoke (even though it was a non smoking room), the entire room had a sickly sweet smoke smell to it, and the ceiling was stained. The carpet was thin and stained and not something you wanted to walk on in our bare feet. The bed sheets were stained. The air conditioner sounded like a jet engine taking off making it impossible to keep on while trying to sleep. The noise from the street was terrible, and the other guests in the hotel seemed to all get home at 3am and need to run up and down the halls and slam doors to announce that. The only reason I gave this hotel two stars instead of one was because of the suprisingly clean and renovated bathroom, I almost wanted to sleep in there. As far as budget hotels in Waikiki go, there has GOT to be better options than the Ohana Waikiki Malia.

I've been to Oahu 6 times now and have stayed here 2 of my last 3 visits (Ohana Tower last time. Torn down now. Lewers st. construction).  The Malia doesn't have a pool or barbeques or many of the other extras that I never seem to use anyway. Just a nice basic hotel with clean rooms, nice bathrooms and a great location. Located on Kuhio (one of the 2 main roads parrallel to the beach) and lewers st. A block or 2 to the International Market Place and Duke's lane on Kuhio. 3 long blocks to the beach. Buses are accross the street and so is the free trolley to Hilo Hattie (nice ride but don't spend much there). If you really want to use a pool, you can stroll about a block and a half to the Ohana Islander and use there's. I never bother. They give you free beach towels at the counter so don't bother packing any. Just ask on your way to the beach and return them after. Nice clean beach towels every day. Very handy. Coin laundry on the 5th floor. Also very handy. Lookout on the roof with a tennis court. If you want a nice clean room at a great location I would recommend the Ohana Wakiki Malia. Side note - The Outrigger Catamaran is great. Been on it a few times. If you get Big Kahuna dollars (on check in), it is a great way to spend them. The Ali Kaii dinner cruise is also great but buy it at Affordable Tours on Seaside st (one street over). They are $22 cheaper, per person, than the tour desk at the Malia. Great dinner cruise.

What makes things worse is that I work in the Travel Industry as a marketing co-ordinator I know that flashy pictures and fancy words can fool many. However we were pleasently surprised about how well this hotel measured up. When we checked in we requested to upgrade to the one bedroom suite, and was advised that it would only cost an additional US25 per night plus tax. This was very reasonable and decided to upgrade. We were placed on the 9th floor (top floor), with a nice view of the city. The layout of the suite consists of a lounge room with two single beds made up as day beds and then the main bedroom, it also has a small kitchenette to prepare meals. The large balcony makes is perfect to sit there and enjoy the city and the mountains in the background. The decor was very nice and these rooms had just been recently renovated. The hotel has two wings the Luana Wing Tower where all the suites are located and the Malia Tower wing where all the standard and city view rooms are located.The hotel has a cafe located off the lobby and has buffet breakfast from US7.50 per person.

I don't care that there's no swimming pool (it's Waikiki, i'd rather go to the beach!). However, that also means there's no place where you can have a shower or get changed if you have a late flight (I had a 10-hour flight leaving around midnight, and felt really crusty cos i couldn't have a shower after spending the day snorkelling - just had a cold-water rinse at the beach). there were some people from the UK complaining about the same thing so it's not just me. Apparently if it's not fully booked they can open up a regular room for people to shower etc, but the day i was leaving the hotel was full (so no late checkouts either).

My needs were pretty basic and the Malia was a good fit for that situation. No frills, just the basics. I only had one remotely negative experience, the first room I was given was really grungy despite the fact that housekeeping had cleaned it. Walls were yellowed with cigarette smoke and the carpet was so stained I'd be hesitant to walk barefoot. I called the front desk to inquire about another room and they were very accommodating. They relocated me to a newer part of the hotel and the room was immaculate. Despite that first hiccup my stay at the Malia was fine. The hotel was quiet which surprised me being that my new room was located right near the elevator. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the hotel is centrally located so everything I needed was well within walking distance. The thing that impressed me the most though was, after accidentally leaving an expensive item behind in my hotel room, I called to see if they would mail it to me. To be honest I didn't think Id ever see it again when in fact it arrived in the mail today. To me thats indicative of the best kind of customer service.","Seattle, Washington","WAGeekGirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",14,3.0

Next morning they said their reservations centre had declined the wholesalers request as they didn't have 1 b/r suite availabe for the Chirstmas period but could provide one. Changed over to 1 b/r suite, that afternoon front desk rang and said we couldn't have it, would have to change back to standard room overlooking street. Front desk staff not helpful, wouldn't accept prepaid travel voucher, had to pay with our credit card. Rooms overlooking street are noisy, the bedding smelt musty, waited as long as 10 minutes for lift to arrive.

The location was convenient to everything in Waikiki. The staff was helpful and friendly. The room was very clean, except for the A/C vent was very, very dirty upon our arrival. We asked it to be cleaned, and it was within the hour. The parking garage, however, will not accomodate much of a car. We drove an Intrepid, very carefully in and out. Anything bigger, and we would not have made it at all! The restaurant is fine if you want the breakfast buffet. But I would not recommend wasting your money eating there. Poor service is the main problem with that. Overall, it was a nice hotel that we would consider revisiting if there is no availability at the Hale Koa.","Norfolk, VA","Maps29528</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Norfolk, VA</strong>",5,3.0

Do you like taking a shower without getting scalded everytime someone in a nearby room flushes the toilet? Does a musty oder bother you? Do you like to watch even a little TV, lets say the morning/evening news and weather on an all color TV, not just in a blue or green tint? I wasn't sure what about our week-long stay was not perfect in Paradise - how could we not be having the time of our lives no matter what hotel we we're staying in? I realized it was the uninviting room we had to return to every evening. O'hana hotels are old and tired. If you want to truly enjoy your entire vacation, spend more money and don't stay at an O'hana.","Carpentersville, IL","Freedom22101</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carpentersville, IL</strong>",15,1.0

Reception staff are polite but on been shown to our room we found it to be very, very basic. The room was not double glazed so you could hear the traffic, which as you are on a main road with road works going on was not pleasant. They start work on the road at 6 a.m each day. We were told this will go on for another year at least. The cafe in the lobby is of poor standard and not overly clean we felt. You pay 3$ for the safe and 2$ for using the coffee each day. The bathroom is quite small and the shower kept changing temperature while been used! We had the use of a courtesy room on our departure day. This was spacious and very pleasant and we just wish we had been blessed with this room instead of our ""pokey little room"". We will not return to this hotel but would go back to Hawaii.","Redcar, United Kingdom","BabsA51</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redcar, United Kingdom</strong>",81,1.0

We were at the Beach in minutes and the International Market was right up the street (Great Shopping). The trollies and buses were always available for transporting. The Zoo was a nice stroll down Kuhio. There was food eateries everywhere and McDonald's was next door (super for the kids); they serve pineapple with every meal (yummy). We had only one complaint, the parking area was very tight, when driving in the lot patience is a must. We are returning to Hawaii March 2005 and will stay at the Ohana Waikiki Maila again.

Parking was terrible and the ramp very steep. Only certain elevators go to certain floors. The room we got looked right into the other hotel and we could see what people were doing with or without the lights off. That meant we had to keep our drapes closed. We went down to change rooms. The other side of the hotel only had smoking left. I even offered to pay extra for a suite but once again only smoking rooms. We finally went back to the original room. The first night was okay but the second was a different story. The room across the hall had 30 people in it and they were singing really loudly late at night. I called the front desk several times with nothing changing. I even went out in the hall to see what room and the security guard was there was told him to listen and get them out. It still did no good and once again I called the front desk and told them if they did not do anything I would call the police. By the time it was 1 in the morning we were so tired we fell asleep to the noise. The rude people across the hall were up at 6 the next morning being loud once again. The hotel staff was very rude, this would never be a place to ever stay again. After having spending two nights in the waikiki beachcomber, this place was awful.",,Experience26335,9,1.0
