It was a very last min find, but it did not dissapoint. Great location. The staff were friendly, helpful and fun. I always had something to do during the day with their good range of excursions available, and for a good price. The atmosphere was great every evening. If you are a solo traveller, I would HIGHLY recommend staying here. You are guaranteed to make friends for life. I stayed in a 6 person dorm. Very pleased with the condition and cleanliness of it, the cleaners were there daily. Lockers for valuables (don't forget a lock for it). Access to Fridge and freezer. And the rooftop is a great social area, during the day and at night. All in all, brilliant, I did not want to leave. Fantastic hostel.",,LisaT3622,0,5.0

The reception was super friendly and always helpful with everything. Even the cleaning ladies were so friendly, they became real friends of mine. They organised daily tours for a really good price in which you could experience the whole island. My favourite activity was the skydive that they offered to do. When will you get such a chance to skydive in Hawaii! Out of that every night the rooftop is THE place to be. DRINKS, FRIENDS and FUN, what do you need more in life.After the night you can expect a nice breakfast with waffles, fruit, peanut butter, bread...etc. No complaints from me tho.If I come back to Hawaii, I will definetely book the same hostel, without any hesitation!Thanks for giving me this out of the world experience..","Olmen, Belgium","Rudolf_s_1998</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Olmen, Belgium</strong>",1,5.0

My friend and I visited Manoa Falls, Tantalus Lookout, Makapuu and Lanakaii Beach through those tours and had much fun! Our guide took us down the cliffs at Makapuu to enjoy the tide pools. He’s the best! (Pic 2)We had one FREE pizza night in the week, lots of great food top hangouts and a movie night and they always offer different and new events you can be a part of!

Everyday they have activities you can join such as hiking, a tour to Pearl Harbor, pizza night etc. you’ll never feel alone but also you have enough hidden spots to get some time for yourself. The first time I stayed at the hostel with my mom in May 2018 and she loved it. No matter what age or gender, you’ll get a heartwarming welcome. The waffle breakfast is legendary, it’s really clean and they have the nicest staff one could ask for. Waikiki beach is only 2 minutes away, every Saturday there’s a little farmers market around the corner, bus stations close by to get everywhere and lots of affordable places to eat.

From the morning waffles to the evening rooftop pregaming, it can be your party destination or your bed to just crash. They even offered me first aid supplies when needed.

I wasn’t too sure what to expect, but it honestly changed the way I would like to travel in the future! Firstly, my trip to Hawaii was very spontaneous and last-minute. What was supposed to be a girls trip with a close childhood friend ended up being a solo trip as we realized we didn’t have the same travel-style/itinerary of things we wanted to do while on the island of Oahu. So we went our own ways. Never having travelled solo before, I was slightly anxious... BUT EVERYONE AT THE HOSTEL WAS SO NICE, guests and staff alike! The hostel’s organized activities each day were so much fun (not to mention very reasonably priced!) and made it super easy to make friends with people staying at the same hostel (which would lead to daily roof top chillings and meetings at the beach for sunset just a good big gang of friends). Special shout-out to Ashley working at the hostel who made me feel so at home while I was there that I almost didn’t leave!! Being back home now, Im still in touch with so many people from all over the world that I met during my stay at the Beach Waikiki boutique hostel. I rate this hostel 5/5 for its SOCIAL aspect, best people who are always down for a good time. Even someone who’s quite shy, as myself would find themselves at ease, very friendly environment :)Second, as someone who’s never stayed in a hostel beforehand, I was very impressed with the facilities, nice clean spacious rooms, great rooftop lounging area, BEST BEST BEST LOCATION (literally one block and a half from the beach and close to everything you could possibly need), FREE delicious waffles and coffee every morning, FREE wifi... honestly I didn’t have a single problem, even when I got locked out of my room twice whoever at the front desk would be more than happy to come open it up for me :) I rate this hostel 5/5 for its LOCATION/FACILITIES*Note* I stayed some nights in a semi private room which was very nice, your own room with a shared bathroom and common area.. didn’t have a problem with noise or anything. Also stayed in a mixed dorm of 4, which was great, by then I already knew the people in my dorm from the activities and it was just like a big sleepover among friends.The only thing I would say is this is not the place to go if you don’t wanna socialize, Waikiki in general for me was very sociable, hard not to socialize, everyone is so nice. This hostel had a really great balance of having the option to party and go crazy if you wanted, but also settle down for the night with the 10pm quiet curfew if you’re in need of a good sleep. ALL IN ALL THIS HOSTEL HAS SET THE BAR PRETTY HIGH FOR MY FUTURE ADVENTURES!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING MY TRIP UNFORGETTABLE!!!",,LaraMont96,2,5.0

I was warmly welcomed by Ashley at the desk and she was able to promptly get me set up for my stay. Right away it felt like previous hostels I stayed at in Southeast Asia; ones with community, where the staff are as accommodating as if they were the ones traveling, where you could make friends after a drink. After the first night, my impression was correct. For those three nights, people were always on the rooftop happy to mingle. People made recommendations on places and things to see and do, others would find out they were on the same tour (organized through the hostel), it was a great way to make a social circle as a solo-traveler. In the morning, they have a continental breakfast. I never had a chance to try it but the rumour was that Devina whips up wicked waffles. They also have music they play on a BT speaker at the front desk; it was all solid music that I enjoyed (I suggest mixing in FJM and Arcade Fire). Working in the industry, I know one of the challenging parts of the job is remembering the names to guest's faces. Despite being there during a few nights of full occupancy, Ashley remembered me every time. It's impressive she can do this with everyone who stays there. I look forward to exploring more of Hawaii.

Everyone there - especially the staff - were very welcoming and friendly. I stayed in the 4-bed female dorm for 6 nights. The room had two single-sized bunkbeds, a full-size fridge, a sink, kitchen cabinets, AC unit, lockers, and a small bathroom with a shower. Bunkbeds were comfy and sheets were soft and very clean. Bathroom was clean and the shower had plenty of hot water. The lockers were small (about a foot square), but easily held all my important items. I brought a masterlock combination lock which worked perfectly. The room was very secure and I felt that I was in good hands throughout my stay. The tours through the hostel were amazing! Very cheap and good quality. I ended up cancelling a lot of my other tours because the hostel offered similar ones for much lower prices. They offer several hikes (~$15-20), an afternoon boat cruise (~$40) and a day trip to the north shore (~$30), all of which I would recommend. There were a few other options, but I did not sign up for them. They also offer discounted rates on sky diving, luaus, and surf lessons. I went to one of the luaus and had a fantastic time. You can sign out snorkel gear and reef shoes for free - just get there early to get the nicer gear - and get discounted rental fees for the rental place across the street (snorkel gear, surfboards, etc). Every night from 8pm to 10pm people would go to the rooftop common-space to hang out, meet people, and drink. Often groups would hit the bars afterwards. This was a very welcoming environment and I was making friends on my first night in the hostel! It was great for me, as a solo traveller! On Thursday there was free pizza! Overall, I would definitely recommend. The staff here really care about your stay - I dropped my key down the sink and they got it back for me (thanks Tim!). They were friendly, readily available (at the front desk 24/7!), and always ready to give advice on the sights of Oahu. On my 3rd night there was a mixup with rooms/booking and it was handled very professionally by the staff. If I were to stay again, I would definitely book a private or semi-private room. As a light sleeper, the bunk beds were a little too rickety for me to get some decent sleep. I would find it worthwhile to fork out the extra cash to get a bed to myself.","Winnipeg, Canada","andreadwpg</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winnipeg, Canada</strong>",3,5.0

The tours give you something to do with others,if you want. There's a nominal fee for the driver's availability, but that's to be expected. The breakfast every morning is carb heavy,but with all of the hikes,you need it! Pizza night is awesome! The pizza was really good, actually! I am sad to see the recent ADVERTISEMENT tactics are catering more to the younger traveler. I'm not sure why. I am nothing like the customer image you cater to online. I pray they show more diversity and include all different cultures, ages, traveler profiles, etc., etc, in their photos and industry presence. I'm not sure if I feel as comfortable returning after seeing their new ads of half dressed young girls and partying teens. That's all good, but there's others that hostel, too. Ya know!?

The unpleasant smells lingered for a long time in the bathroom and there is certainly room for improvement. Can you maybe provide the rooms with toilet cleaning agents? What you travellers simply have to be aware of is that you share your room with very different people. Unfortunately, I had to change rooms because one guy brought a girl to the room and they had sex. That was very disturbing and it made me very mad. Also in the second room I had to experience again how a couple had sex. Of course I complained again to the staff and it didn't happen again. Dear Staff, you must be much stricter. Such a thing is absolutely unacceptable. I know that it's not your fault, but you must kick these people immediately out of the hostel even though they paid!! I don't put up with that on my vacation.

It became friend with all of them, in particular Ushi, Zain,Jasmine. They love to interact with their guest and provide best of class experiences. You miss guys !!! (tears)3. Free tours (with 10-20 dollars tips to drivers). They will take you to the best places in Oahu : Koko Head, North Shore, Lanikai. And you will tons of friends too!4. The facility is pleasant, beds are comfy. I planned for a single room for my last night as an ""upgrade"" before i leave, but I would have honestly stayed in the 4 female room as they were all friendly and respectful and the room was clean and comfy.

Nice accommodations for sure, but the rockstar there was definitely Yushi, the GM at the hostel. Yushi was always in a cheery mood and was extremely helping with giving tips and just being welcoming and hospitable overall.

The tour to Manoa Falls and the Lookout was great and a steal--only $10 (driver's tip) for what would have been several very costly Ubers.

The rooftop of the hostel is a great community spot with nice seating and string lights, and everyone gets together on the roof every night to drink, talk, and organize groups to go out to the bars or hit the beach.

The location in Waikiki was extremely convenient as it was roughly 1 block away from the beach with multiple shops around within walking distance.  I stayed in an 6 person dorm room as this was something that I booked online but there are also 4 person rooms and private rooms. Beds in dorm rooms are not assigned so its first come first serve in the rooms for beds. Rooms also had a full size fridge to help keep the beer cold. All have ensuite bathrooms. Rooms all had AC and were comfortable. Cleaning staff comes every morning to sweep the room and do a quick clean in the bathroom. My only thing is that I wish there were hooks in the bathroom to hang towels or clothes. The floors do get wet and sandy as many people are coming back from the beach. Not a places to hang clean clothes or towel before showering other then putting on the toilet seat cover or floor. But overall still a very comfortable room.Now the staff are AMAZING!! All were so helpful with answering any question guest may have about things to do or eat in Oahu. The hostel itself also has many daily tours to different part of the island. Its a great way to meet other guest staying at the hostel. The staff also are great at hosting events to help get everyone together as they hosted a pot luck on Christmas day. I thought that was just amazing how many people it got together that evening. Many people starts the evening on the rooftop drinking and hanging out with other guest till the it closes at 10pm then moves on to a local bar. The rooftop is a great way of meeting other guest from the hostel.Staying at this hostel was one my best experiences ever comparing to the other hostels Ive stay in around the world. There are nicer hostels out there but the experience at this one I will never forget. Yushi the manager knew it was my birthday on Christmas day along with another guest at the hostel. Yushi along with a few other guest got together and surprised us with birthday cakes at the pot luck. I was so grateful for this as all the other guest were there to celebrate my birthday along with the other guest as well. This made it such an memorable birthday and Christmas for myself.

The hostel lets you borrow beach gear (mats, body boards, chairs etc.) for free. The trips they organize are free - you only pay 10/20 dollars to tip the driver. I enjoyed the free pizza on Friday evenings and the free breakfast.Downsides to staying here: my room was close to the reception and I could literally hear everything people were saying outside. The room smells a bit like mould. I guess the rooms are challenging to ventilate and people bringing in wet/dirty clothes does not help either. I knew Hawaii is expensive, but having to pay extra for doing your laundry and renting surf/paddle boards is a bit too much for me. I also found it a bit strange that I had to make my own bed when I arrived. When I hung my bathing suit outside to dry it was gone the next day :( But that is not really something the hostel is responsible for I guess...Overall, this is the best place to stay in Waikiki on a budget.

The tours looked to be awesome value, but unfortunately I didn't have time to take any. The breakfast was ok; not amazing, but it did the job. The location is very good. Close to the breach and at the quieter end of Waikiki. It's easy to use the public bus from this accommodation. CONS - The airconditioning was right above my head and pretty noisy, and there was no way to get fresh air into the room. I really didn't like that there was no soap to wadh hands after using the bathroom. The shower didn't feel very clean, but at least it smelled like bleach and they did change the bath mat each day.

We stayed here for 18 days and 18 nights, and it was extremely hard to leave. For context, I'm a 22 year old guy and was traveling with a friend the same age. I've stayed in hostels in Southeast Asia, New Zealand, Australia, and Mexico as well as higher end resorts/hotels around the Caribbean, Brazil, and California. From day one, the hostel manager was extremely friendly and helpful, providing us with a discount that we had read about online. All of the hostel staff was friendly and very knowledgeable about the things to do around Oahu - from hikes, to surf spots, car rentals, and camping spots. We became part of the family and really felt at home. Outside of the amazing company, the hostel amenities themselves were great. We stayed in a semi-private for a great rate. The kitchen worked well and we cooked family style meals a few times during our stay (ABC stores located within 2 minutes and a Safeway within a 20 minute walk). The AC was awesome and the showers were great. Our sink broke one day and it was immediately fixed without us even mentioning it. The hostel also provides a lot of great beach stuff for free (boogie boards, beach mats, umbrellas, etc). The location is incredible. 5 minute walk from the beach, near a moped/car rental spot, and close enough to the center of Waikiki. We hiked a ton and the hostel wasn't too far from the famous hikes as well as from the less frequented ones on All Trails. There are bus stops near by when you don't feel like Ubering. To explore the rest of the island we went on the hostel trips (they only require you tip the driver, which still makes it a LOT cheaper than going on other tours and allows you to meet people at the hostel - we made a lot of friends - from 20 year olds to 60 year olds and also encountered those who didn't want to socialize, which was cool too). The rest of the island is also easily accessible by car. We rented cars a couple of days and made it around the island and back within the day.The manager is extremely timely and will bend over backwards to make sure that you're having the best experience ever. I've never experienced such great camaraderie and hospitality at a hostel. The rooftop is a really nice spot to hangout at. There are a couple of hammocks if you don't want to be bothered, and then some seating space where we often sat and hung out, drinking some beers in great company. Since we stayed for a while, we saw the hostel at highs and lulls - there were times where Free pizza night on Fridays had no seating room and others where only a handful of people showed up. Through it all the atmosphere was upbeat but light. If it's not obvious by now, I couldn't recommend this hostel more. Whenever I return to Oahu, I'll for sure be staying there again. To the Beach Waikiki Boutique Staff - thank you so much for the hospitality, great service, advice, and above all friendship. Hope to see some familiar faces if I return in the near future.",,Felipe H,2,5.0

I had a semi-private room (full size bed + twin with a shared bathroom and common area with a desk and fridge). If you are into social activities, this is a brilliant choice as there are tours that go daily for $10 or $20 to places around the island, Friday pizza night etc. The place is 3 blocks from the beach! I did none of the activities and basically used this place as a crash pad. My room was tidy and appeared recently renovated with fresh paint, etc. My full size mattress was extremely soft with slippery microfiber sheets that were impossible to stay put. The twin mattress was a bit saggy when sat on. The A/C blew ice cold. Wifi was fast and I had no issues connecting to my work VPN on it. No safe or locker, but the room had a lock on the door. The bathroom appeared recently redone as well, and was clean aside from some worrisome brown stuff on the shower ceiling (mold maybe?).In the end it a tidy, safe and reasonably comfortable place. If you are seeking a bargain on a place close to the beach, give this one a shot. I'm not sure if I'll be back, maybe if conventional hotels are too expensive to my liking yet again when I come back to Honolulu, or need a little bit more privacy.Recommendation for management: check out the ceiling of the shower rooms... mine looked a bit sketchy. And invest in some cotton sheets, they don't have to be fancy.","Seattle, WA","Laura W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, WA</strong>",8,3.0

I came to the Beach Waikiki Boutique early December not really knowing what to expect as it would be my first actual hostel experience and I was traveling solo. As soon as I had arrived to check in I was greeted with a warm and genuine welcome and was assisted with my luggage to my room. The hostel has a very modern ""tiki-style"" vibe and is most importantly CLEAN throughout! There are cleaners that go through the rooms everyday to ensure that both buildings are well-kept and up to standard for all guests. The hostel staff were also incredibly friendly and extremely knowledgeable on cheap local eats, nightlife, and attractions within the the area. I was surprised out how central the hostel was to everything, such as the Honolulu Zoo, Waikiki Aquarium and Diamond Head Crater - not to mention the beach, which is literally a 2 minute walk away. Surfboards, snorkel gear, beach mats and towels, are all available for rent at the front desk (most are free), which is open 24/7. The hostel also provides guests with a delicious complimentary breakfast every morning as well as hosts a free pizza night on the rooftop patio every Friday night which I thought was a great way to bring everyone together. Every day spent here presented me with the opportunity to meet so many different and interesting people - whether they were guests, or staff working at the hostel. Although I was traveling solo I never really felt alone which was settling. I also noticed there were a huge amount of people trying to extend their stay; time flies when you're having fun, so book as far in advance as possible! The Beach Waikiki Boutique has exceeded my expectations by far and has set the bar incredibly high for my first hostel experience. I will definitely be staying here for my next visit to Waikiki.Thank you for everything.",,Yasmin M,2,5.0

We stayed for a week and had no problems with the hostel. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the area. Special shout out to Yushi for giving us great recommendations and always making sure we had everything we needed! The hostel provides free breakfast. Nothing fancy but they will make fresh waffles everyday, provide toast, muffins, a variety of spreads, juices and coffee.One of the best parts of the hostel are the super cheap ""tours"" they provide. A tour is provided everyday to various spots around the island for $10. They have postings on the wall for where they go on each day. Sign up for these trips ASAP when you arrive because the lists get long. They typically drop you off at popular hike locations close to a beautiful beach. All of the tours we took (Monday-Wednesday) were worth the trip. They were also stress free since you just had to get to the pick up spot on time. Otherwise you were free to do whatever you wanted. Most days you would get back around 3-4. The only long day was the north shore. That is also the only tour that is $20. It's completely worth it since getting to the north shore otherwise is long (2-3 hours by bus), or some insane taxi or uber drive. The hostel gives you a lot of mobility if you don't have a car.I also loved that the hostel had a great quiet hour policy. The rooftop lounge was popping until 10pm and then the hostel quieted down while party-ers went out and people who were tired could get some shut eye.All the rooms had AC which was great.

Another great thing about this hostel is the tours that super cheap and the fact that you get to do them with your newly made friends is a bonus. I was lucky because I booked my whole 12 night stay with them online, others were not so lucky, they loved it so much that they tried to extend multiple times, sometimes it worked out but other times it was just too popular.

I stayed with them back in October for two weeks, and opted for the female room. Girls cycled in and out throughout my stay, but there were a few nights where it was just myself and one other female. The shared rooms have two sets of bunk beds and it reminded me of summer camp as a kid. I luckily had pretty chill roommates throughout my stay (one was super grumpy b/c she didn't want the air conditioner to be used, but HELLO, it's nearly impossible to sleep without the AC on and we all out-voted her). I have to be clear...this is a HOSTEL, not a hotel. If you're a priss and need 5-star accommodations, look elsewhere (and expect an incredible mark-up). Please also keep in mind that you are in Hawaii. With humidity that is pretty freakin high. If you've never been to a humid part of the world, mold grows easily in enclosed spaces. There was some mold in the shower, however I came prepared with some designated shower sandals (there's an ABC Store right around the corner if you need to pick some up). It kills me to read reviews of people saying this hostel is ""filthy"" when it's not. You have to be realistic and realize you're not staying at the Ritz Carlton. And that's part of the reason why the rates are insanely cheap! The staff are some of the sweetest people I have met while traveling. Suzie, Shoyen and Chris were awesome to chat and hang out with. They host various dinners and activities throughout the week, so staying here you have insta-friends to hang out with, if you'd like. I'm not 20 years old anymore, so meeting and hanging out with people was not my goal, but the offer to grab drinks or go out dancing was always there. I sometimes felt like a grandma, going to bed early so I could get up to enjoy the sunrise or go surf. I had a few roommates who stumbled back in the wee hours of the morning, but that is to be expected and didn't bother me too much. The location is perfect! A few blocks away from the beach, ABC Store, Starbucks and Teddy's Burgers (you MUST eat here at least once!!). The bus stop is a few minutes walk away (although they do run on Hawaii time, every so often). The rooms are cleaned lightly everyday. Lockers are provided, however you probably want to bring a lock to secure anything of value. I never felt like I had to worry about any of my roommates swiping anything, but it's better to be safe than sorry. A full-sized fridge is provided, which was great to be able to store food. There is a sink and stove in the room, however the hostel requests that you cook anything in the kitchen on the rooftop. Upon check in, you are given sheets for your bed. At first, I thought I was going to get too cold in the middle of the night, but you really sleep just fine without a comforter. I was also able to get a clean set of sheets after I stayed with them one week, I just brought them down to the front and got a new set.Breakfast is included, however I typically eat paleo and I heard all that was offered was toast and the like, so I skipped it. I was also on an acai bowl mission, so I was usually on the hunt for a new place to try a bowl (the best one I found included yogurt and macadamia nuts and was a 15 minute walk away, at Tilia Aloha Cafe). All in all, I had an awesome experience staying at The Beach Hostel. If you're up for an adventure, definitely consider staying with them!

I will start with the negatives of this hostel as, unfortunately, they far out weigh the positives.Cons:- Our room was FILTHY. We had to purchase cleaning products and disinfect the entire bathroom and most surfaces in the bedroom (including door knobs + light switches) prior to using anything. The shower curtain was also covered in mould. - The hot water could *sometimes* be unreliable. - We also purchased our own towels, as the ones we were given had a bad odour to them. - We weren't given any blankets, despite seeing other rooms with blankets. - The furniture was also filthy and worn out, the TV had marks all over it and desperately needed a wipe over. - However, my main concern is that half way through our stay the hotel staff decided that would be the perfect time to change the TV stand to a 'better' one (their word not mine). All of our food, beauty and hygiene products were on top of this stand (of course there was a towel we had bought between the surface of the TV stand and our products). They TOUCHED each of our belongings individually and MOVED THEM so that they could change the stand. I cannot even begin to tell you how wrong this is: firstly it is unhygienic and honestly disgusting, secondly it is unprofessional and lastly it was completely unnecessary (why couldn't they wait 5 more days until we had checked out to do this!?)- The atmosphere was horriblePros:- AMAZING wifi- Location was good, only a couple of blocks from the beach and a block from bus stops - Space to hang your towels outside- Fridge was clean- Lots of info on attractions, nightlife etc on a notice board opposite receptionUnfortunately the positives end there. If I were to do my time over I would have spent the extra $50 a night and booked a decent hotel rather than the 'junior suite'.

One just has to take a look around at the other hostels in the area, and The Beach comes out on top against any of its competition.Situated about a block from Waikiki beach and Kapiolani Park, the location is just about perfect. Everything you'll need during your stay, be it convenience stores, a grocery store, coffeeshops, bars, restaurants, shops, malls, etc, is within walking distance.Bus stop to the Ala Moana center is just a block away, so it's easy and convenient if you want to travel around Oahu. Staff is nice and friendly. But some people take it more seriously than others. Hence, your experience with the staffers may differ, especially if you're only there for a short stay. But I spent 8 nights there and it was all good.4-bed dorms are spacious enough and come with ensuite bathrooms. The bed frames can be noisy, but the mattresses are super comfy. Each dorm has its own A/C unit to keep it cool and comfortable at night. In terms of cleanliness, though the rooms are swept every day, they are not cleaned daily. I know our bathroom was only cleaned 2 or 3 times during my stay. It's not a major shortcoming for this hostel, as the place remains relatively clean anyway, but it is something that could be improved upon.Regarding the mixed dorms, The Beach is one of those hostels that advertize their existence, but essentially they only exist if you are a mixed group traveling together. After spending 8 nights in the hostel, I didn't meet a single guy who had a girl staying in the ""mixed"" dorms. I'm not too keen on single-sex dorms, which is why I always steer clear of HI properties. It would be nice to know that in essence, this is what you get here. Nothing wrong with that, but it's a bit disingenuous to advertize mixed dorms when there are none. Having at least one female roommate usually keeps guys cleaner and better behaved, which is why I habitually go for mixed dorms. . .You can borrow certain things for free at the reception, or rent surf boards and snorkeling gear for a nominal fee. Which is nice, as prices on the beach are not always cheap.The huge rooftop terrace is awesome It has its own kitchen, bathroom, and big-screen TV. It's a great place to hang out and meet other travelers. This is where the breakfast is served every morning. As nice as it is, however, it would be nice if there were other common areas where you could meet and chill with people.Speaking of breakfast, it is bare-bones, but it is free. It's basically only toasts and blueberry muffins. Nothing special, but it gets you going!Don't miss out on the free Korean BBQ night (Saturday) and on the free pizza and beer night (Tuesday). Both are fun, the food is good, and it's the perfect opportunity to meet other travelers.Though quiet hours are enforced at this hostel, the same cannot be said of the one next door (Polynesian Beach Club Hostel). This is a really ghetto hostel and it attracts a ragamuffin crowd. They can be pretty loud and obnoxious, often very late into the night. The night staffer from The Beach is supposed to monitor this and call the cops when that happens, but they're not always quick on the uptake. So if you can't sleep because it's too noisy, do go down and remind them that it's their job to make sure that their customers get to sleep at night.As far as the noise is concerned, please steer clear of Room 13. It's the corner room at the end of the front of the building, and it opens up to the courtyard of the Polynesian Beach Club. Where all the noise is coming from. For more peace and quiet, request a room in the back of the hostel. The front of the building, even if you are closer to the reception than Room 13, faces the valet parking area of the Queen Kapiolani Hotel. And those guys shout as if they were working on a construction site, so don't expect to sleep in come morning. The valet parkers begin their shift around 6:00am and then you can forget about peace and quiet. . . The back of the building probably is the best place to stay in order to get a good night's sleep.Free wifi works well. But they have 8 different networks, so sometimes you have to change networks for it to work for you, depending on where you find yourself in the hostel.Overall, this is definitely a good hostel offering very good value. No other hostel in Waikiki offers A/C in all its rooms. No other hostel in the area offers such spacious dorms with comfortable beds. No other hostel features such a cool rooftop terrace. And no other hostel offers all the free perks The Beach offers its guests.By far the best budget option in Waikiki!",Montreal,"Pat5150</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal</strong>",163,4.0

My room was very clean and I was happy with the bed as well. The best thing about this hostel for me was the location - great access to Diamond Head and of course Waikiki. That's the best value.The staff were pretty weird though. I was changing my booking on the day I was meant to check in and the girl didn't really seem to care or didn't want to explain to me the process of cancellations/charges. She wasn't rude but just kind of absent? Also weird to have a kitchenette in the rooms that aren't allowed to be used even though they are advertised.

I initially had booked the semi private room, with a shared kitchen and bathroom, but on arrival decided to upgrade to the private room, where you'll have your own bathroom and kitchen area. In hindsight it was definitely the right choice, for the little extra cost it's well worth doing in my opinion. Breakfast is included but but is a basic affair, simple bread/toast, with jam or peanut butter, and some small muffins, it's very much a DIY job, but it's adequate, and there are plenty of eateries in the area should you feel the need for something more significant. It's located in a relatively quiet backstreet, not on a main busy road, it feels perfectly safe, and is about 3-5 minutes from the beach, so that's all positive. Staff were always friendly and helpful, and if I came back to Honolulu again I would stay here. It's an expensive place for hotels, many with 'resort fees' on top of the basic cost, and as long as you're the type of traveller who spends most of the time out and about exploring the place, rather than lounging at the place where you're staying, it'll be easily adequate.","Somerset, UK","ForceTranquille</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Somerset, UK</strong>",24,4.0

We made a booking for a private junior suite and paid a deposit. We're 30 years old and thought we'd have fun spending time around other people our age. When we got to the hostel, the guy at the front desk had my name in his system, but said he didn't have a room available and instead they had a room arrangement with the hotel next door. He gave us directions to the other hotel. It became pretty clear that the front desk person was voiding our reservation since my name was in the computer already. Since we had nowhere else to go on short notice, we went to the recommended hotel.Sure enough, the woman at the hotel next door said they had no such arrangement with the hostel. However, they did have a room available, so I stayed there because I had no other choice; all other last minute reservations would cost significantly more than I was planning to spend. Do not go to The Beach Waikiki Hostel if you have a problem with your reservation potentially being unexpectedly cancelled on the day you're planning to check-in for the first day of your vacation.","Franklin, Tennessee","InnocentDoll</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Franklin, Tennessee</strong>",47,1.0

The hostel would put on a BBQ on a Saturday night and a pizza night on a Tuesday on top of the rooftop. This is how I got to meet so many amazing new people who soon became my new hiking buddys. The rooftop closes at 10 which would usually mean guests would go to their outdoor settings (usually a table and a couple of chairs) back at the room to continue their evening. The staff were amazing. The desk is maned 24/7 so if I ever had an issue they were there to help out. This came in handy with my flight delays and constantly having to call them and change my booking which they did with out any hassle. Not only did they help with my accomodation they also provided us with hints and tips on what to see, where to see it and how to get there, which was very handy with trying to work out bus routes. Sheets and a pillowcase/pillow were provided on arrival. The only thing you'll need to complete your room, As an additional extra, is a lock for your locker. I gave it 5 stars, even though the furniture isn't what you would see at Hilton, because as a backpacker it's everything you want and need for that type of experience.

Location: the location is decent, but it's all the way at the end of waikiki, so for access to the strip, or shopping, pick somewhere closer to ala moana. Noise: it's noisy, lots of people noise. Rooms: we had an air con unit running all night but it wasn't right, as it was still to hot to sleep. Bad experience for us.

We were booked into the 4 bed female room. When we checked in we found that this room is right behind the reception desk. The room was filthy - overflowing bins, fridge full of out of date food / drinks, and COCKROACHES!!!!!I don't expect a hostel to be amazing (although the ones in Europe I have used have been great) but I do have a few basic expectations: clean bathroom and room, lights that work (of the two only one worked and was right above a girls bunk) and the room to be quiet enough to sleep... which this was not. As this room was behind the reception desk people would gather through the night to drink and chat with the staff... and play ukuleles!!! It also became clear during our five night stay that staff used this room as a staff room; unlocking the door to use our bathroom during the day, coming in unannounced to access the cleaning cupboard or to store luggage for other guests.When I told the Fijian girl on the desk about the cockroaches she just said, 'I couldn't clean yesterday because you locked the door'. Of course we locked the door when we went out, all our things were in there, otherwise why issue is with a key?! She was lying anyway as the previous day 'someone' had unlocked the door and left some luggage in the room and it didn't belong to my friend or I or either of our other roommates.Basically for what this hostel charges you can get a motel room slightly further from the beach in Waikiki. I'm by no means picky about hostels but this is one of the worst I've seen. The two pros of the place are Hailey on reception - super helpful and friendly and can give you tips of where to go and where to avoid; and that the beach is literally a five minute walk away!Other than the noise, filthy room and useless staff (except Hailey) I'd also warn you that the breakfast included is damp muffins (left in the fridge to go soggy overnight), coffee, tea and toast. You're better off spending $10 for a breakfast buffet to keep you going all day. I'll definitely be back to Waikiki in the future but will be finding another hostel or hotel!!",london,"donnakelly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>london</strong>",10,1.0

Firstly the pros; the location is excellent in relation to Waikiki, a short walk to all shops restaurants and very close to the beach and bus routes. The room itself (we stayed in a double bed private for 7 nights) was clean, spacious, comfortable and all have a full size fridge. The cons; The level of customer service we received can generously be described as non-existent. The staff were disinterested, distinctly unhelpful, unaccommodating and at times rude. This ranged from simply ignoring you while you are waiting to be served right in front of them at reception, to unapologetically informing you there was no more coffee or butter available for breakfast to a complete lack of friendliness or enthusiasm. There are numerous more specific examples of this unhelpfulness however a quick glance of some of the other comments on this page will tell you all you need to know. Honestly all this is debatably acceptable if we were paying much less but at almost $130 per night for a private that is a complete and utter joke. Which is where another one of our gripes comes from, when booking this room on hostelworld the price of the room is only $108 and the wording lead us to believe that taxes were included in that however we received a little bit of a shock on arrival to be informed that our room was intact much more expensive than we thought, we're not new to prices not including taxes so this may well have just been an oversight from us but i definitely feel we were mislead by the wording and have booked many times on hostelworld without ever having paid taxes after, at the very least this is something people should be aware of. Bearing that in mind, for $130 per night you expect your room to be cleaned daily, which it was not or for the sheets to be changed at least once, which they weren't, in fact one day we returned to the room to find the sheet scrunched into a ball and left in the middle of the bed which we found very strange. For that price it would also be reasonable to expect a shower where the handle wasn't falling off the wall, or to have reliable hot water (we went three consecutive days without), or even more strangely when the description of your room says 'kitchenette' but does not contain a single knife, fork, plate or anything even resembling a kitchen utensil.It is a total mystery where the 'boutique' comes from in the title. This is basically a overpriced, dated, american country town style motel with staff that would be better suited to a job that didn't involved any sort of customer service.Honestly, if you're willing to pay the money our experience is that you will get a decent room in a good location but nothing else. If we had our time again we would stay elsewhere, particularly as there is two other hostels on the next street and infinite apartment options nearby for the same price.",,Jamie F,5,2.0

I must say that the girl who had checked me in was awesome - good customer service, she seemed genuinely friendly & welcoming. However, I came crashing back to classic sketch hostel reality with a thud when (after a rather late flight and a not so ""speedi"" shuttle) after I struggled to drag my admittedly ridiculous amount of luggage up a daunting flight of stairs & around the entire circumference of the hostel to my dorm I probably wasn't in the best frame of mind to appreciate the small room consisting of 2 bunk beds, a wonky ill laid out kitchen and a tiny dirty extremely poorly planned bathroom (you literally had to squeeze between the sink and a narrow gap to access a small rather filthy shower). I was exhausted by the time I'd finished making my bed and while i'm not thrilled about a top-bunk situation, happily the mattress was comfortable. The new looking AC unit definitely worked in that room(it was freezing and the sheet provided wasn't cutting it...strange to complain about AC in a hostel.) Even in the morning light I struggled to see how that room could possibly have been upgraded? What specifically was upgraded and by whom? I think the flooring must have been upgraded, but had noone maintained it since the reopening in July? The luggage of the other 3 girls strewn about every available wall and corner didn't help the situation. Luckily, I didn't see any bugs (and at that point I certainly wasn't about to go searching for them). No security concerns I was aware of - I felt safe in the hostel.At first glance, the rooftop patio looked fun & felt boutique-y (especially for a hostel) but after a closer inspection when I sat down to eat the complimentary toast the counter felt/looked grime-y...it didn't help that previous guests hadn't bothered to clean up after themselves and birds were scavenging the plates, darting about the seats & tables. Not the end of the world, but kind of disappointing because if it weren't so superficially grungy - it would've been a pretty impressive common area.I didn't take any pictures to reflect on, but I think it partly could be that I was unable to get the luxe fantasy hostel out of my mind...after all I'd only stayed one night so my initial perspective may have softened with a jaunt to the beach(it is nearby), getting settled and meeting some of the fun, interesting travelers I'm sure we're staying there...pizza & beer couldn't have hurt either.If you're travelling solo, a bed here is still considerably less $ than the cheapest of Waikiki hotel rooms...some of which probably have more bugs and less comfortable mattresses.In summation, I'm not saying don't try this hostel, I'm just recommending to do so with less emphasis on boutique and more emphasis on hostel.","Vancouver, Canada","Bourne2go</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",19,2.0

We decided to stay here because we wanted to spend a few days at North Shore (which is absolutely beautiful by the way), but other nearby accommodation (such as Turtle Bay Resort) was very expensive. As soon as we came into the room, we were greeted by a medium sized cockroach running out of the sink, and about 30 flies (the sort that land on dog poo). I went to the local store and purchased some roach traps and a fly swatter, and proceeded to execute the flies and lay the traps. This solved most of our problems, and we ended up with about 4 roaches in the traps after 2 days, including one giant one!One of the cupboards was hanging off, and we didn't even dare to use any of the plates, etc. What did make me laugh was a tips jar on top of the cupboard; and people had actually being putting tips in!A big positive about this place, is that the balcony of the room overlooked a gorgeous mixed rock/sand beach, with the room being about 3 metres from the sea. Unfortunately our balcony door would not open, so we couldn't enjoy it!In fairness, if you aren't bothered too much about creepy crawlies, and need a cheap place to crash while you enjoy the beauty of the North Shore, then it's not bad for the cost.","Preston, United Kingdom","petec84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Preston, United Kingdom</strong>",39,2.0

The atmosphere and staff are fantastic and I left with lifelong friends. The owner does a lot for his guests such as free pizza & beer nights, free dinners when he feels so inclines, free shuttle service to bars and tours in the company van to accommodate requests and which beat the price of any other tour operaters out there!The breakfast is good & the rooms are great (there is a massive fridge/freezer in every room and a little kitchenette with a microwave). No lockers unfortunately so bring a lock for your bag. Saw some people locking bags to their beds which was a clever idea. The gate is locked at 11pm though so no one from outside the hostel can get in.There is a nice outside socialsing area open until 11pm and a fab hammock out the back. I spent a lot of time recovering on that...The staff are all awesome! Willing to help and very nice, fun people. This hostel has only been open 8 months so the front desk process is slow and organisation somewhat lacking. It is a shame cos this hostel is so great in every other way but for a new business they really aren't doing badly.If I went back to Waikiki I wouldn't even look to stay anywhere else!If they added lockers and had a little more organisation at the front desk I would be giving 5 stars. But I encourage anyone to look past this and give this place a shot. It is awesome!","Whangarei, New Zealand","Bexen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Whangarei, New Zealand</strong>",92,4.0
