The staff are just fantastic and super nice. Breakfast was great. Added bonus. Popcorn throughout the day. Added bonus. Towels for the pool and beach. Added bonus. I have stayed before in the major hotels here and to be honest, this was a little more enjoyable. Great location. I am definitely going to stay here again next time.

I stopped in a no parking zone while my wife went in and asked about parking. I knew that we would need to find parking or use the valet. When she asked about parking they told us that you could find a place along the Ali Wai Road or use valet parking at $30. There are other parking garages around but we weren't informed of that. We chose valet parking for the convenience.We were told that breakfast was from 6:30 to 8:30. I thought that the 8:30 hour was a little early for a shut off but realized later that this was to make sure everyone was awake before the jack hammering started after 8:30. We were gone by 9 on Monday so didn't notice anything amiss. However we were a little later starting on Tuesday and heard the noise. I asked about it and they told me that it was construction going on that day. Then we had a tour on Wednesday that we waited for until later in the morning and heard the jack hammering start. You couldn't hear the TV unless it was loader than the noise. I went down stairs that there was a gentleman, quite irate at the noise. He was screaming how this was totally unacceptable along with a few other words. They offered to move him but it wouldn't have helped since we were in the lobby and it was juist as noisy as the rooms. The desk made a call and the noise quit. We left on our tour so I don't know what happened there. Thurday we were gone early again so missed the noise but when we got back to the hotel that night the AC wasn't cooling very much. We were going out for dinner so we figured it would be better when we got back. It was worse. We called the desk and they got someone up there. They couldn't make the AC work so moved us to another room.Friday more noise and I complained to the desk. They apologized and offered to move us again. Why it was still noisy. They said that this was the last day and it would end by 4:30. I asked them to make it right. Nothing happened. Now if you have gotten through this the good things are that the hotel does supply a breakfast and that would cost you a minimum of $40 within walking distance. If you drive maybe $25. The con is that the breakfast is scrambled eggs and sausage with a variety of breads or waffles. Cereal and fruit is also available.The location is good within a mile walk there are all sorts of plases to eat, shop and enjoy the beach. The rooms are good size but the bath is very small. 2 foot sink, toilet jammed in between the shower and sink with a minimum dimension allowed by code. The valet parking was nice and the attendants were pleasant and quick. If not for the construction and lack of acknowlegement of the problem I would have give the hotel a 4 but as it was don't stay here until they are finished with the construction.","Phoenix, Arizona","Mike H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",213,2.0

The air conditioning was a window a/c that needed a cleaning and the curtains in the windows were torn. We both woke up sneezing from allergies.

The bed was comfortable and firm. Pillows were firm enough. Had an upgraded view of the water along Ala Wai boulevard. It's a nice view. The walk to the beach is about 10-15 min. There are shops nearby. However , the room is old. The air conditioner is the old school box in the window. So it's loud. The breakfast is so basic, it doesn't even have any ham or sausage or bacon. Worse of all, it's only from 6.30a.m. to 8.30a.m. You are not allowed to start taking at 6.25a.m. and they start packing at 8.30a.m. sharp. I've never been to a hotel that ends breakfast before 9a.m. except in Japan and I thought even that was ridiculous. How do you expect guests to get up so early on a holiday? It seems like an insincere gesture to provide breakfast. Although housekeeping is done every day, I hve had dirty towels (I.e. yellow stains) on the rack on two occasions. I find this unacceptable. The metal towel rack was old and a little rusty. The showerhead didn't work so well because the tap below (for a bath) would be running as well, wasting water. Because the tap is so old, you don't dare to yank so hard, in fear that the tap would be broken later.

The hotel does provide ear plugs which were very good at blocking out the noise, but this shouldn’t be the long term fix for this. The balcony doors either need replacing or new seals need fitting. Also the air con unit was very noisy.Another issue was the fact that the air con spat out water all over the balcony, rendering the balcony useless during the daytime.When I was there I did do a price comparison to some of the hotels closer to the beach and they came out roughly similar. But aside from those things my stay was pleasant at the Coconut, and they clearly are upgrading to address some of these issues which I cannot complain about!","London, United Kingdom","Aidanpeters</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",1,3.0

My family, my better half (pregnant) and I and our 3 year old were excited about the trip and excited about he hotel and the ""extras"" and with the price and the size of the room we booked.Our trip however was highlighted by a extremely disappointing and gross experience due to lack of effort, practice or pride by the housekeeping staff upon changing over the room from the previous guest.We had booked the Executive suite for 7 nights. Upon arriving we found the room to be huge and it had 2 bathooms and was well laid out. Excited to see our double lanai's we go to the balcony {which had a view from the sliding door of the canal and mountains) and found both were locked due to construction. We traveled over 4000km to be stuck with out a balcony. This was not mentioned when we booked and only later upon arrival were there signs posted. We were not happy.We phoned down to the front desk to voice our displeasure and were told we could move to a room with a view which was much smaller. we declined and ask to see if anything could be done the next day.That night we went to bed late and I slept on the convenient sofa bed with my daughter well my partner slept on the bed alone.The next night, not being moved to a new room yet, my partner went to have a nap and woke up with her sweatshirt smelling like urine. She got up and smelt the covers and it smelt like pee. Since she had slept alone that previous night on the other side of the bed no one had been on that side of the bed yet. We peeled back the covers, sheet by sheet right down to the mattress cover and the scent become stronger and stronger. Someone or some pet had peed the bed and it had traveled down to the mattress. We called the front desk immeadiately and they sent up a nice and polite man who worked in some capacity for the hotel and he came into investigate. He was dismayed and grossed out as well upon seeing and smelling what had happened and said ""that this should have been noticed when they changed the sheets.""Obviously someone had skipped out on this practice and my better half woke up with wearing a shirt that stank like someone's urine.He then said tomorrow they would replace the mattress and i asked if we could move the mattress to the hall and he thought we shouldn't. We ended up moving it to one of the hallways in the suite and all three of us ending up sleeping on the sofa bed.After visiting the front desk we requested that the manager please call us the next day and we were assured they would.The next day came and after not hearing from the front desk we called down and asked if the manager was in yet. We were told they were in a meeting till some time and that they were looking to move us to a new room.Somehow the same suite type room was now magically available.We never got a call from the manager to talk about what happened.After finally being moved, the rest of our trip was very uneventful and we could see the promise of the hotel and what it offered. The day to day front staff were very polite and nice and they seemed to have some pride in their work.However the fact that we never got a real serious call from the management is quite appalling. To travel such a distance for a vacation to relax and unwind to find ourselves sleeping in a bed that was peed and never changed probably is totally unacceptable.No one would ever want to stay in any class hotel in those conditions. And the fact that we had to put in a lot of effort to fix the situation compared to a level of extreme importance once they heard and saw what had happened is even more wrong.Construction of the outside of the hotel...unfortunate. No balcony access in first room....disappointing....(eventually got 2 balconies albeit of a parking lot view)...But having to sleep in a bed that wasn't cleaned properly and quickly changed with new sheets.....GROSS and totally.",,FamfromNewWest,0,2.0

When we arrived we had difficulty getting round the scaffolding to get our cases through the front door and nobody came to help us.During our stay 1 of the two lifts was out of operation and I got the impression that it was unlikely to be mended.We could not sit on our balcony as there was a constant shower of water from the aircon above. We reported this but nothing was done about it. Our aircon left a constant pool of water on the balcony.The safe and the toilet roll holder were both hanging off the wall. If you could get on the balcony, part of the view was ok but straight ahead were guys carrying out building work on flats opposite and creating lots of dust.Breakfast was provided but it was buffet style and reminiscent of a youth hostel with plastic plates, eaten at bench tables, if you could find a seat, or otherwise on settees in the reception. The food was ok but the conditions were poor. The hotel did not have a bar or restaurant.On the positive side the staff were friendly, our room was clean and adequate and the pool basic but ok.

The construction really did impact our stay negatively as it began with drilling and banging right outside our window around 8:00 am all 3 mornings we were there (in hindsight we should have asked to be moved) and we prefer not rise early on vacation. The complimentary breakfast was ridiculously early 6:30-8:30 and short (clearly not catering to to those on vacation) so we didn’t get a chance to partake. There was also signage saying you were not permitted to take food to your room otherwise one of us would have made the trek down and brought back food.

It had a mini fridge and microwave which was wonderful when qe had left overs. The AC was noisy but the complimentary airplugs drained the noise out. The hotel is very central to shops (e.g. Waikiki shopping centre, Ross, ABC stores etc) and restaurants (e.g Roy's, Hard rock Cafe, Cheesecake factory) The Ala Moana shopping centre is accessible by taking the #8 which stops a block away from the hotel. The #8 also takes you to the Honolulu Zoo. My recommendation would be to extend the breakfast time to 06:30am to 9:30am instead of 6:30 to 8:30. The area is very small but there is enough room to eat outside. If you miss breakfast IHOP and Dennys are within a five to ten minute walk. Waikiki beach is also accessible along with Fort Deherry Beach (you can see fireworks here for free on Friday nights!)Special thanks to Jessica who is the epitome of competence and went above and beyond the call of duty to make our stay memorable. The complementary Moscato and chocolates were also a nice touch.I would stay at this hotel again just to see what it looks like after the renovations are complete. It might not be a five star hotel but the service is top notch! ","Toronto, Canada","Semone04</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",22,4.0

They recently introduced ""Snow Ice Hour"" a mixture of shaved ice and ice cream with a variety of toppings. It was a sweet and cool treat that we took advantage of before heading out to the beach. They also had a snow globe making workshop during our stay that was really fun!

The hotel is located several blocks from the ocean and probably not practical if you are there for the beach.

Whilst the location is convenient it does come at the cost of a lot of traffic noise from the very busy road outside until the early hours of the morning . If you don't mind the sound of car horns, car radios blaring and other traffic related noises then you'll be fine.To be fair, it may well be quieter in other rooms that don't overlook the road and ear-plugs are provided if you are happy to wear them when asleep and this may well alleviate the problem.We were really impressed with size of the room and the facilities provided. The bed was large and comfortable, the pillows were fine and we slept reasonably well once the traffic noise had abated.A safe was provided in the room and the air conditioning was effective and good.The hotel was undergoing renovations outside at the time of our stay and whilst this didn't impact us at all as we were out during the day we couldn't help thinking that our room could do with a bit of a renovation as well. The paintwork was somewhat tatty and there was poor finishing in the bathroom. Our room had two toilets but one of them only flushed when it felt like it so we didn't use it. Had we stayed longer we would have reported the matter but for our short stay it was something we could manage without.The room could have done with a bit more of a clean as we discovered a previous guest's used ear-plug on the carpet which wasn't a particularly pleasant find.It was nice to have breakfast included in our stay and although there was a limited selection it was enough to start the day with. Breakfast is taken at two long tables so the likelihood is that you will be sitting right beside a stranger which may, or may not, be an issue for you.There did not appear to be any free parking within a reasonable distance so using the hotel car-park is the only option but it is expensive as you would expect when they have a monopoly on the situation.We would consider staying at this hotel again but would certainly look at other options first.",Devon UK,"Tillard</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Devon UK</strong>",121,3.0

Room was clean and had all the essential items, comfortable bed. We were welcomed with Hawaiian shaved ice when we arrived Friday which was nice. Staff was very helpful and friendly. The balcony view was nice for evening or watching the sunrise. It was a tad noisy at night on floor 4 close to a busy road.

This hotel is quite cheap compared to the up-market hotels and includes breakfast, so in this respect it would be classed as value for money, but if you are looking for good in terms of quality, then this is a lot further down the list.To start with the positives:-- Friendly and helpful staff- Well decorated and spotlessly clean- We had a large room with two WCs- The bed was very comfortable- Hot water and a good showerNow the not so good:-- The building fabric and fixtures were very tired making the room very noisy eg slat windows at the ends of the patio doors did not keep out traffic noise, wall hung air conditioning units were too noisy to leave on at night, the fans linked to lights in the toilets were very noisy- There is a coffee machine with six pots provided, after this you need to use the coffee provided in the reception area which is not ideal for longer stays- The breakfast area is a small area by the lobby and has two long tables for guests to sit at that do not give much privacy- The breakfast was average at best- The pool is smaller than many domestic pools that I have seen and along with the patio is unlikely to get any sun at all- There is no bar or restaurantIn addition to this, it is located near the canal at the back of the Waikiki district on a junction of two busy roads and the area seems a little down market compared to the glitzy areas near the beach.We were booked in for 5 nights by a cruise company and left after only one night. Perhaps I should have checked the hotel in depth, but instead I relied on these reviews and the rating at the time. Strangely, we booked into a well known chain hotel across from Waikiki beach that cost a lot more, but had a far lower Tripadvisor rating than this hotel, hence the title of this review.","Bridgwater, United Kingdom","Kelvsam1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bridgwater, United Kingdom</strong>",8,3.0

The room was very clean and had a small kitchenette area with a sink, microwave, mini fridge, plates, bowls, glasses, cups and cutlery. This was great if you wanted to keep snacks or extra drinks in your room. When we used anything it was replaced the next day by housekeeping. Continental breakfast was served every morning from 6:30 - 8:30 and consisted of scrambled eggs, cereals, waffles and various toppings, yogurt, fruit, granola, bread and pastries and tea, juice, coffee. Great way to start the day. Popcorn is self served in the lobby daily at 1pm - 6pm. Unsweetened ice tea and flavored water (orange and lemon /cucumber) are available in the breakfast area daily. We used the beach towels daily and the chairs and umbrella once. Never used the coin operated laundry but did see several guests using them. Gym was tiny but fine if you wanted to use them. Never used the pill as we opted for the beach. There was a giant checker and chess game outside and board games in the lobby area for families to use. Check the activity schedule to see what is happening at hotel for the time you are there. Great extras that go a long way.Wanted to say thank you and a job well done to Jessica at the front desk who was a wealth of knowledge and extremely helpful. When asked for area suggestions on activities and restaurants she was spot on. Jessica suggested Top of Waikiki and Dorako and we were not disappointed. Go if you can.

Everyone was very friendly. We stayed at the Coconut Waikiki Hotel in January 2019 for 3 nights. We stayed here at the end of our 11 night Oahu vacation. We wanted to get a taste of the city before we headed home. We were very excited about this hotel based on our research. We booked this hotel because it had a heated pool, fun classes, and proximity to the beach. After we checked in we went to our room to discover that there was construction going on outside the hotel on the balconies. We literally had someone drilling into the wall of our room. We immediately called the front desk and they moved us to a room farther away from the construction. It was better, but the construction could still be heard during the day. We decided to not worry about the construction and head down to the pool. We went to get in the pool and it was ice cold. I went and asked the girl at the desk about the heated pool that was advertised and she said it has been broken for a while and they were waiting for a part. That was a huge let down since we specifically booked this hotel because it had a heated pool. We had already spent 8 days at the beach and we were looking forward to a couple pool days to end our trip. I understand that issues happen, but we made our reservation months in advance and really think the hotel should have notified us about the construction and lack of pool so, we as a family could have decided if we wanted to stay there or not. The other thing that was a let down was the classes offered. My son and I were looking forward to trying ukulele lessons and found out when we got there that no classes of any kind were offered the days we were there. It would be great if a schedule could be posted on their website so people know in advance what is happening when they are there. When we checked out I let the young man know that we were really disappointed in our stay and he credited us one night of parking. That was nice of him, but really $30 does not make up for our disappointment. If we are ever in Waikiki again we will stay a lot closer to the beach and make sure our hotel has a nice heated pool.","Orcutt, California","smteacher13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orcutt, California</strong>",1,3.0

There is a bit of street noise, but that is true almost everywhere in Waikiki. The value was very good, especially given the excellent breakfast that was included (breads, toaster, eggs, waffles, cereals, juice, yogurt, fruit, tea, coffee). Unfortunately, we did not time our trip to take advantage of the activities such as lei making. And it was too windy and cool for us to make use of the pool (late January).

There are board games to use, out door games and barbecue as well. The pool is minuscule adjacent to the lobby. There is a guest laundry which we used but it wasn’t that good a washing machine for some reason the powder didn’t dissolve and stained our clothes so we had to wash them twice. They have activities during the day, we saw lei making and Zumba advertised and joined an excellent wine tasting.

The little extras of breakfast (not fancy but perfectly adequate), all day refreshments in the lobby (love the pineapple tea and popcorn) and games for the kids. They even have a sandpit! They provide beach chairs and towels for free and while the pool is unheated, it is a nice area to relax in. There's a bbq and some sunloungers. So everything you need for a great stay in Waikiki. The beach is two blocks away and the shops and restaurants one block away. Easy to recommend especially for a family.","Auckland, New Zealand","flyok</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",76,4.0

We even walked up to Diamond Head summit (about 14 kilometres round trip) and the much closer Ala Moana Shopping Centre. Lots of reviewers mention the “basic” breakfast. Well, it’s pretty good for continental, where you wouldn’t normally get eggs. The hotel is a little dated and the pool area could use some work but it’s reasonably priced and has lovely, helpful staff. Little touches like cleansing towelettes make you remember a place (and a comfy king size bed will do the trick too).

It is only steps to restaurants, malls and the main beach in Waikiki. You can't ask for a better location that isn't in a crowded location. The breakfast every morning is sufficient to getting your day started right (wish there was bacon/ sausage) but eggs, toast and waffles were a great start to my days. If you wish an alternative, McDonald's and Ihop are right around the corner.The staff are extremely friendly and eager to assist you with requests. Upon your arrival they will write your name on the board to welcome you to the building (awesome touch). They even do birthday shout-outs. Whoever does the boards is very creative. (Thank you Issac for the birthday greeting for my partner). They offer different lessons every day that you can sign up for at the front desk - Ukulele, Lei, etc....All the amenities that the hotel offers aren't really listed anywhere, so ask the desk first for : umbrellas, beach chairs, towels, etc.... When we arrived they were under construction which we weren't advised during booking but the staff did accommodate us and moved us to another room the next day so that we could see the sun rise with our morning coffee. The regular rooms are smaller than your average rooms at other hotels. But perfect for rest and relaxation. The suite rooms are larger and roomy. All the rooms, bathrooms were super clean. When i visit Waikiki again, this will be the hotel that I will stay at. Worth the money and the location is fabulous.",Toronto,"1picture</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto</strong>",20,5.0

Room was dated. Carpet and furniture a bit old, dingy. Bed was comfortable. It was very quiet at night. Room was not cleaned thoroughly when we arrived. Some hairs left from previous guests in the bathroom.Nice lobby where you can hang out. My family bought take out and ate in the lobby a few times as it was more comfortable than eating outside or in the room. Lots of tables and chairs in the lobby. Pool and gym were lacking but better than nothing. Free activities you can sign up for adds value. Yoga, ukulele, lei making, etc. They also offer free beach towels, chairs, umbrella, toys for the kids. It's a bit of a walk to carry all that to the beach though.Breakfast is okay. Gets a bit boring after a few days of the same thing. No meat (sausage, ham, bacon) is served. Eggs, cereal, bread/toast, yogurt, granola, fruit, waffles, coffee, OJ.Staff were all very pleasant. Front desk, cleaning, everyone were nice.All in all, a decent stay. The rooms are a bit old but comparable to other hotels in the same price range. Service was good and all the freebies were a nice touch.

Later, some of the guys (like the big dude working in the front) seemed seriously annoyed when you asked for things like towels, or to get your car.Continental breakfast was also not bad, but not great. When I was told it was pretty much just cereal and yogurt, I skipped out. They also have popcorn in the afternoon.The real kicker was checking out. I was rushing out in the morning, and realized on the way out that I hadn't grabbed a couple dress shirts on the way out. These are dress shirts I didn't wear during the trip, and unpacked/placed in the closet. I called the front desk, who, over the course of several days and several calls, ""confirmed"" that no one had checked into that room before the initial call, and when they were finally able to get a hold of her, said the housekeeper did not find anything. They were adamant that no one there had it and refused to entertain the possibility otherwise/investigate this issue.There is literally nowhere else they could have been, and were discovered to be missing on the way out of the hotel.If you ever stay here, I'd lock everything you can in the safe, and consider anything you leave behind for even a moment lost.","Escondido, California","jloehen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Escondido, California</strong>",10,1.0

Upon check in we were upgraded to a suite with 2 bathrooms which was very nice. The room itself was large, nicely decorated and clean. It was not that warm so we had the AC on only shortly and had it off during the night as it made noise and it was not needed. The only thing that was little annoying was the wind as it was very loud some nights. Some of the windows were not actual windows but had holes in them that could not be properly closed so it made sound but we were tired from the sun anyway so it was ok because you cannot control the weather.The breakfast was very basic just eggs, waffles, a bowl of fruits and yogurt and 3 types of cereals but better something than nothing. The time was a bit early 6:30-8.30 but at least we got up early and had a full day ahead of us. In the afternoon there was flavored water available which was great and from 2-6 there was a popcorn, which is a nice gesture. The pool is very small but the area was clean and it is okay to chill for a while as you are here for the ocean, not the pool. The staff was friendly and nice and even let us park our rented moped behind the gate for free. The location is good as well. Close enough to the beach and all the shops and entertainment. I think it would be around 10 minutes to get to the beach. I think you are close to everything for a much cheaper price.

And the free iced drinks and tea/coffee in the lobby 24/7 was delicious and came in handy. Breakfast included waffles, vanilla yoghurt, oats, choc chips, fruit (not sure if fresh or tinned), toast, crossaints/danish/etc, scrambled eggs, cereal. All included in the room cost.

We stayed on the 5th floor in a very nice comfortable clean room. Continental breakfast was included the next morning. We also had some fresh fruit filled drinking water and popcorn in the afternoon which i thought was a very nice gesture - friendly atmosphere - also had the wifi in our room as well as the really nice lobby with couches, tables and tv. The walk to the International Centre was not far, many stores to visit and a great walk in the area - not far from Waikiki beach if you like the 10 minute walk or less.

The price we paid for our room was reasonable. We booked 30 days in advance and received an additional discount. If you need to cancel your money is non refundable if you choose to do the 30 days in advance. When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly receptionist and valet. The check in was quick and easy. The receptionist informed us that they had upgraded us. So we were excited until we reached our room. The room was facing the main highway and construction was going on right below our room. On the night stand we found two sets of ear plugs. You definitely needed them if you wanted a good night sleep. The room was adequate and was very clean. The other reason I rated this hotel as average is our bath towels had holes in them. Housekeeping should have caught this and thrown them away. Breakfast was average. The day we were there it was raining and there was no where to sit in the dinning room and lobby. If your looking for an average hotel with no frills. This is a good bargain. Also parking will be $30.00 a night. ,"Santa Clarita, California","teenalafferty</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Clarita, California</strong>",0,3.0

Although he's no longer part of the establishment the current staff at the hotel are equally friendly and accommodating.We returned last year and again this year. When you travel for a lengthy period like we do (we usually stay for over a month) having a comfortable place to stay and people that are welcoming is exactly what Coconut Hotel delivers on. We haven't had one bad experience in our 90+ days of staying at this hotel over the past few years. This hotel is very consistent, from the kindness of the staff to the cleanliness of the rooms. They’ve gone above and beyond, making sure that you have the best room available, even if you didn't book that view or bigger bed :) Thanks Jordan (Manager) for upgrading us and giving us the same room we stayed in last year! We really appreciate your attention to detail and hospitality towards us.When any issues arise they are quick to resolve it with your comfort in mind. On one day towards the end of our stay, the AC in our room stopped working and Isaac (who is a sweetheart) was quick to book us in to another room for the night on the same floor while they fixed the AC in our room. We didn’t have to move any of our stuff over, it was just to make sure we got a comfortable nights sleep. We really appreciated the attention they gave us.

Simple buffet breakfast is included with cereal, toast, croissants, waffles, fruit, juice, coffee and tea. Plenty of options to keep you full for a few hours. My only gripe is that breakfast is between 6:30am and 8:30am, and the staff start removing items from the buffet as soon as 8:30 hits regardless of if you're getting food or not. I think they really need to extend the breakfast to around 9:30am like most other hotels.Complimentary tea, coffee, ice tea and fruit flavoured water are available 24x7 (serve yourself), and popcorn is freshly popped in the afternoon which is great for a snack to keep you going.The location was great for us, it's around a two block walk from the main drag of Waikiki, which is good as you don't have to deal with the busy factor of the main street. The hotel is across the road from a beautiful river, and there's a conveniently located 'Biki' bike share rack just out the front where you can hire a push bike if you want. Lots of souvenir and convenience shops are located within a two minute walk. McDonalds and iHop are only one block away.There is a heated pool, but it's quite small. Beach is only a ten minute walk away, and they let you borrow beach towels and sand 'play' toys for the kids. We took some pool noodles and floaty rings to the beach. Was nice not to have to purchase them.If you hire a car, be aware that the hotel charges you $30 per day for valet, and there's no nearby free options unfortunately (well there are, but the parks are always taken).All in all we had a great stay and would come here again.","Cranbourne, Australia","Kent R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cranbourne, Australia</strong>",74,4.0

If you want to be right on the beach, or want to be pampered with luxurious resort amenities, go ahead and spend $350 a night to stay at one of the big beachfront resorts. If you want a clean room with friendly staff at a reasonable price that leaves you plenty of money in your budget for activities and fine dining, this is a great choice. The hotel is about 3 blocks from Waikiki Beach (about a 10 minute walk); they provide towels for free at the desk. We didn't plan to spend time at the beach other than a brief walk, so the distance wasn't a concern for us. All of the staff members were friendly and helpful. Parking is valet only for $30 per day, which was comparable to any other hotel in the area I looked at; we never had to wait more than 5 minutes for our car. The room was basic, and the bathroom rather small. The only minor complaint was a slight musty smell in the bathroom, which I think was coming from the shower curtain; everything appeared clean and the towels were definitely fresh. There was construction going on next door, and you could hear some road noise from our room, although they provided complimentary ear plugs, and even though we went to bed early we were not bothered by noise at the time we were going to sleep.","Memphis, Tennessee","acwtravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Memphis, Tennessee</strong>",14,5.0

The driveway entrance to the hotel is on Ala Wai Blvd and is small and difficult to see at night, so if you miss it, you have to go around the block. I suggest you come in on Lewers St. which has less and slower traffic. When you get to Ala Wai, turn left (if you go straight, you'll end up in the canal) and immediately make a left into the sloping up driveway. Staff was very courteous and Hawaiian friendly.

It was enjoyable to sit on the balcony and take in the views. Our room was equipped with the usual small fridge, microwave, wet bar sink, Kuerig coffee maker, cups/saucers/forks/knives, etc, TV, desk, hair dryer, clothes iron, etc. Although it’s a small property, they still have an outdoor pool, dining area, sitting area with games and a nice size lobby. My only disappointments were the in-room coffee was not replenished daily (you’re given 4 Kcups upon arrival but any after that cost $2 each) I was able to find a box of Kcups at a local grocery store but even that was a little difficult to find. My other disappointment was with the complimentary continental breakfast - the choices were not changed from day to day. If you are not stay for more than a few days, it would be fine but we stayed 7 days and by the end of our week we were searching for more variety. Overall, I’m pleased with our stay at the Coconut Waikiki.

We didn't avail ourselves of the continental breakfast, but it looked ok, if you're happy with cereal or a bagel and coffee. I would dock the 1.5 stars on the following grounds: They give you 4 starter Keurig cups (none of which were actually just medium roast coffee...we had a decaf, a dark roast, a creamy vanilla thing, and a green tea.) After that, you pay $2 a pop, so we just bought a box at Long Drug. Seems a little chintzy not to supply 2 coffees/day. Also, the light switch in the bathroom worked 20% of the times you pressed it, due to an improperly secured electrical box. The sink faucet was loose and wiggly.

The room and amenities were very clean and service was excellent. It's truly service with a smile any time of the day; from the valet, the front office, to the maids everyone was super helpful and friendly. We stayed for 5 nights and the service was never wavering during the whole period. The room was equipped with everything we needed and the hotel even supplied free earplugs should guests be bothered by the traffic. We did not need to resort to using them, but if you are a super-light sleeper you may. Getting a hotel that offers valet parking is definitely a plus, even though you pay $ for the service. Another plus is the free breakfast. It is buffet style, but includes waffles, cereals, fruit, yogurt, and a selection of bakery items as well as scrambled eggs every day. You can sit in the dining room on two long tables sharing with other guests, or retreat to the privacy of the patio. The atmosphere is casual, and we ate breakfast here every day. If you want more variety or meat for breakfast, there are a number of restaurants in walking distance. I never felt unsafe, even walking from Waikiki beach to the hotel once it was dark, but I would advice to use common sense, especially when traveling on your own. While the hotel is away from the main drag of Waikiki beach, many of the tour companies have stops around this area of Waikiki and will pick up passengers by request.

I stayed with my Mom and kiddo for 11 nights. I was a little worried I might regret the last minute switch but now I am so glad I cancelled my reservations at the Hilton. The staff at Coconut Waikiki were very pleasant and helpful, by far the best I've encountered in any hotel. Both the hotel and my room were clean, and comfortable. The room was the standard room with 2 full size beds, I did like that it had the Keurig, fridge, and microwave. The lobby was decorated nicely for Christmas, which was a nice touch considering we weren't home for a majority of December. The breakfast is typical of most hotels, although another protein source would've been nice. They do offer powdered eggs every morning, yogurt and fruit, with an abundance of carbs: cereals, oatmeal, croissants, bread, and a waffle station. I'm not complaining because most hotels in the area I was looking at didn't even include a breakfast. Every afternoon in the lobby they make fresh buttered popcorn with toppings, they have at least 4 different flavored waters (1 was tea) to choose from. This was a nice treat, especially when you need a snack to hold you over till dinner timeYou are 3 blocks from the beach, less than two from some great shopping and restaurants, but biggest benefit is you are a little out of the way of the crowds and traffic. I did stay on the tenth floor and with the AC on I didn't have any traffic noise wake me up (they do have ear plugs in the room). This leads me to another point, the bed and pillows were very comfortable! I may be 34 years old but with 2 herniated discs and some arthritis in my lower back, I always worry about how well I'm going to sleep, I'm happy to say I did not wake up to roll over 7x.They have a small laundromat downstairs which was another great commodity, especially for a 10 day trip! It costs $5 per load (wash and dry), they will happily exchange your cash for quarters at the front desk. I packed a few laundry pods to have on hand, glad I did! The valet parking is very convenient, I'm not the type who likes to depend on public transportation or stressing over finding a parking space. So the $30 a night was worth it to me. As mentioned before, we were walking distance to just about everything which was great because if you like some great craft beer or cocktails, you are walking distance from the Yard House and the Maui Brewing Company! This was nice when my clean and comfortable room started to feel too small with both my Mom and kiddo in it ;) I only drove the car to visit my friends on Hickam AFB or go sight seeing. The location was perfect in my mind. Thank you for making my stay positively memorable while visiting friends and family!

Our room had everything we needed, coffee maker, microwave, small fridge, sink and cutlery. No complaints with room.Facilities were great - we didn't use the pool but it was heated. The best feature for us was the sandbox outside - for quick trips for our son to play in. He also enjoyed the oversized boardgames in the back as well. We also enjoyed the complimentary all you can eat breakfast daily. You had options of eggs, yogurt, fresh fruit, fresh waffles, cereal, toast and more. Also a key bonus was the hotel had drinks and popcorn after 2pm to help yourself too.Front desk staff was super friendly and helpful.

The room itself was clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and the air conditioning kept the room at a comfortable temperature. It also had a microwave and mini fridge.

There is a complimentary breakfast from 6:30am - 8:30am, coffee and cold water throughout the day and popcorn in the afternoon.CONS: The breakfast is very carb heavy (waffles, cereal, pastries), which is typical for a continental breakfast; however, some fruit or protein options would have been great. We only ate breakfast at the hotel a few times during our stay. The room only had a stand-up shower (no tub), if that matters to you. The bathroom door often closed on it's own and a couple drawers in the dresser were sticky. The only parking available is valet and costs $30/night, which I understand is typical, but you should be aware of before booking. Also, if you're sensitive to traffic noise, the hotel is on a fairly busy street. They do provide free ear plugs in the room.OVERALL: I would definitely recommend the Coconut Waikiki to friends/family and would stay again.

They may be worn, weary and dusty, giving an abrasive holiday feeling that just doesn't feel right. Not so at Coconut Waikiki, where revamped rooms sporting a witty, colourful finish await! Add friendly, informative staff and a bang for your buck amenity fee that includes free tea, coffee, popcorn, fruity flavoured natural water and a bonanza breakfast buffet and you're looking at a special place in downtown Waikiki. Free gym services are also in the mix - a small but decently equipped fitness room is the perfect place to burn some of the calories from the overly rich American diet! The hotel is located 10 mins from the beach and close to Waikiki's famous shopping centres and attractions. The only minor drawback here is the noise from the cars on the street but earplugs are provided and you are in a capital city so this can be expected.

A few days before I got an email from Jordan the Director of Guest Experience reconfirming the reservation and wondering if we were celebrating anything. I emailed him back that we were celebrating my wife's birthday and if there was anything he could do to make the stay extra special, it would be great. Got their early on the day (around 10am) and Jessica who was on duty told us that the room was not ready but that she could call us when it was and that she could store our bags and even call us when it was ready! She was super friendly and while were walking around in Waikiki, we got a call around 1pm telling us it was ready with a great upper floor location, our bags were in the room and all we had to do was get our keys and go to the room. Room was awesome, on the 8th floor and on the quiet Lewers side! But what was really great was that in the room was a hand-decorated customized birthday card and box of chocolates from Jessica downstairs! It was such a sweet gesture (who does that anymore???!!!) It was truly something special to see in the room. Back to the actual room itself, it was huge (as the older refurbished hotels are), king bed, 1.5 bathrooms, wet bar with plates, microwave and good size fridge. Even had a Keurig coffee maker! Both bathrooms were nice and spacious and the bathroom amenities were pretty good. Ran downstairs to get the afternoon hurricane popcorn (nice touch) before going back out to the beach. They also had beach towels and beach chairs we could use. On our way back we could see that they had a book sharing library and board games we could borrow (most of the books were in German or dutch LOL). Room was nice and quiet and the A/C was actually a tad too cold (had to turn down the A/C). We had a nice view of the mountains and the Ala Wai Canal and could take great pictures from our two balconies. I had seen that the hotel on-site didn't advertise their gym on the paperwork but had seen it on the website. Woke up at 6am and found it; small but totally usable with free weights, 2 treadmills, 1 cycle and 1 stepper. Good enough for my 45 minute workout and no one was there! Continental breakfast was impressive. The usual suspects were there with cereals, oatmeal, yogurt, granola and they even had scrambled eggs and made to order mini waffles and coconut syrup (that was the best!). Next day we decided to hang at the pool. It was a small pool (and I thought it was supposed to be heated but it wasn;t) but since we were the only ones there the whole time we were there, we didn't mind! They even had giant board games in the back lounge area of chess, jenga, dominoes and even a sand pit to build sand castles. To be honest, I was extremely impressed with what the Coconut Waikiki Hotel had to offer for the money: huge rooms, with wet bar/kitchen, great bathrooms, included breakfast and fun things around the property. But a big part of our great stay was the hotel staff especially Jessica and Jordan. In this day and age you truly remember great customer service! Even when we left the hotel around 3pm the person on duty even wished my wife a Happy Birthday again! Mahalo Nui Loa to the the Coconut Waikiki Staff!

My flight arrived early in the morning into Honolulu so I took the early check-in option which meant my room was ready for me as soon as I arrived at the hotel As I'd just come off a 9-hour flight, it was great to get straight into my room, have a shower and a small rest before heading out to enjoy the splendour of Waikiki.The room I had was on the 10th floor and my room looked out onto the Ala Wai Canal - there is a small balcony so I could sit outside if I wanted to. The room itself was huge (as well as spotlessly clean) with a king-sized bed, plenty of space for my luggage, an in-room safe and a kitchen which had a microwave, fridge, and a coffee maker, so self-catering is an option. The bathroom was a good size too with a shower. I did have a problem with a leaking cistern initially but that was resolved with a call to the front desk.Speaking of the front desk, they were all incredibly friendly, but particularly Isaac who always had a friendly smile and was happy to help out with any queries. The front desk also provide beach towels which can be used for the hotel's swimming pool or if you wanted to take it to the beach. Breakfast comes with the room rate and it's an excellent continental buffet selection - cereals, granola, fresh fruit, yoghurt, scrambled eggs, toast and waffles along with fruit juice and tea/coffee and it runs from 6.30-8.30am and there was always an abundance of breakfast, even when the hotel was full of guests. During the day, there's complimentary flavoured water for guests in the lobby and in the afternoon complimentary freshly made popcorn.I really couldn't ask for more from the hotel and I will definitely stay here again on my return to Waikiki. While it's not right by the beach, it is only a short stroll there and it's in very close proximity to loads of great eating and drinking places (particularly on Kuhio Ave and Lewers St), there is an ABC Store 2 minutes walk away and the bus-stop for the local bus service (The Bus) is also just outside the ABC so it's so easy to get around.

My husband and I stayed only for 2 nights only and could have easily stayed longer.The hotel has been renovated to an up to date boutique design. Check in was friendly and speedy - maybe the front desk knew we were tired from our travels. Our room was cozy, clean and spacious. The king bed was firm but still comfortable. Bathroom is an average size but had been updated.Breakfast is wonderful addition. 2 waffle griddles, assortment of breads; scrambled eggs, cereal, fruit and yogurt.The hotel really knows how to treat their guests. They will also provide (based on availability) beach chairs, umbrellas and towels for no additional charge. I also did see the front desk provide a toy pail for a toddler.Location is great. It’s probably a 5 minute walk to the Waikiki Strip (Waikiki Boardwalk, Sheraton, Moana - very close by) and 25 minute walk to the Ala Moana Mall along the canal.Highly recommend this hotel for service, location and value!","Vancouver, Canada","travellingdixie41</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",18,4.0

Initially we drove around the hotel twice trying to find the entrance to the valet as we missed the small entrance the first time. The entrance is immediately around the corner once you make the left turn on Ala Wai Blvd while driving on Lewers St. The daily valet cost is $30 which is comparable to many hotels in the area. We were greeted by the friendly staff upon arrival and check in early for our room. We booked the Penthouse Suite. They informed us that there is daily breakfast in the dining/ lobby from 6:30-8:30am. Breakfast consisted of waffles, eggs, fresh fruit, pastries, and cereal which is pretty typical for places I've stayed at.When we got to our room we exited the elevator and went up one set of stairs to get to the Penthouse Suite which has a floor to itself. The Penthouse Suite included two bedroom (one queen, one king bed), a queen sized pullout couch, two bathrooms, and balcony which had a nice view of our surrounding area as noted on its website description. The living room and dining room is very spacious and was set up very nicely. Both bathrooms were spacious and was ideal for getting ready for the wedding or even to just get ready for the day.One of my favorite characteristics of the Penthouse Suite was the air conditioning. Each part of the suite had its own unit. I turned down the thermostat in my room to a somewhat chilling temperature while my friends in their own room or the living could use the heater or leave it at a moderate temperature.The hotel itself is a nice walking distance from the Waikiki Strip, the International Marketplace, and various food places which is nice because there isn't much street parking from what I have noticed.I'd like to thank Isaac and the rest of the staff at the hotel. Our time in Hawaii was about 70% planned, 30% spontaneous. Isaac down at the front desk was very helpful and offered suggestions and tips about where to go, what to do, and what to see in Hawaii. The valet staff especially as we were consistently coming and going to the hotel multiple times a day.

First, there were tiny little ants in the room on the desk (that was right next to my side of the bed). I killed a few, wiped up their trail in the hopes that they wouldn't return, but they did.

Also the night before I checked in I checked in with Jordan to inquire if there was a bathtub in the room and he replied ""Yes!"", so I went and bought some bubble bath as it was our anniversary.... When I check in Issac helped us and he informed me that a late check-out would not be possible as the next day they were close to full occupancy. I also learned we were on the 4th floor - there are 10, so not quiet the upper floor I was hoping for, then when we got to the room, I quickly realized that there was no bathtub. I was still in good cheer, the room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge, microwave, silver wear, hair dryer, iron & ironing board, toiletries.... I send a quick text to Jordon to let him know that he was mistaken about their being a bathtub and that unfortunately there was no late check out or high floor available. I quickly got a call to the room from Isaac at the front desk saying he received my message and could I come down he would like to get me into the room I wanted and make our stay memorable. When I went downstairs Isaac apologize and he offered us an upgrade to an executive suite which had 2 bathroom and a bathtub. He also gave us the late check out we wanted ( 2pm) and had sent up a bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates for our anniversary. The executive suit room 408, was still on the 4th floor, Isaac had explained he unfortunately was not made aware of my initial request for a high floor and there were none available ~ was a nice sized room, with a couch, I presume with a fold out bed, two air conditioner units, and a bath and 1/2... the only less then appealing thing about the room was there was black mold? on a section of the ceiling in the bath tub/ shower bathroom.I am so appreciative of Isaac's care and customer service, the coconut Waikiki Hotel is lucky to have him on their staff, he is a real gem!

As we were a group of 30 people from New York and Maryland from the US, Bacolod and Metro Manila from the Philippines, Macau and Barcelona, Spain - our first requirement was a good and reasonably priced hotel in Waikiki. And we were so glad to have decided on the Coconut Waikiki hotel. All arrangements prior to our trip was efficiently handled by RicK Oberdalhof, the Assistant General Manager through email. We needed 7 big rooms and He offered our group very good rates . On arrival date, We were pleasantly surprised that one of the rooms was upgraded to the penthouse suite as Rick thoughtfully realized that our group needed a big place where our big group can socialize with each other. He also made sure he met us one morning to welcome us personally to Hawaii.The rooms were clean and serviced everyday. The view that I got was the Canal view and it was gorgeous . It was so nice to start our day with the view of the sunrise.It was a short 10-15 minute walk to the beach and the shopping. There are several good restaurants just a few steps away. The service we got especially from the Front Desk was amazing. Kudos especially goes to James Asuncion , Jessica and Isaac who were always there to answer our questions and attend to our needs . The parking attendants were also so helpful.A big plus is also the free continental breakfast which had a waffle bar. It helped to start our activity filled days with a full stomach. There was also free flowing coffee and infused water the whole day. And a bonus every 2pm till 6pm, there was free popcorn !Upon our return to the hotel after 5 days, most of our group were upgraded to the mini suites!How fantastic is that ! A part of our successful Reunion in Hawaii is definitely the Coconut Waikiki stay.Thank you again for a wonderful stay, Rick !","Makati, Philippines","351MariaM351</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Makati, Philippines</strong>",32,5.0

Jessica had lots of great insights too and was very friendly and helpful. Isaac was the one who cheerily welcomed me with a card and personalized greetings, Hawaiian style! Mike was a great valet, as was Robert -- always had my car ready when needed. The variety of iced, fruit-infused water was great, as was the popcorn. The breakfast was good, but rather crowded. The lobby area was very nice and airy. The evening popcorn was great. The beach towels and chairs were a great addition. Some minor items for improvement:- the breakfast area gets very crowded. It might help to at least make the hours 6:30-9:00 or 6:00-8:30 instead of 6:30-8:30 so that some can beat the rush- the a/c control in the room is confusing and a directions sheet would be helpful- some of the bathroom cabinets don't close right and the lower shower knob didn't quite work. These should be tested out after each guest stay - the checkout staff were not half as good as the others mentioned above. They were professional but not particularly helpful.

It suits my needs, and there are good things, and some things that many would consider not quite good. Here’s the lists, you decide:Good: -From the front desk, to the cleaning staff, to the valet parking, everyone is super enthusiastic and very helpful, chock full of the Aloha spirit.-The front desk has free beach towels and (small) beach chairs for free. Just pick ‘em up, and return at the end of the day!-When I’m in paradise I don’t eat at the hotel breakfast, but it looks very well subscribed, and it’s good for grabbing a banana or Danish to tie you over till you get to “Eggs & Things.” In the afternoon they have ice tea, cucumber water and popcorn…really nice after a long day walking about Honolulu.-The parking is SO convenient. Compared to 20 min wait to valet park, or even self park, at the Hawaiian Hilton; at the Coconut you just drive up the ramp, and Mike’s always there to take the key. We called down just five minutes ahead each morning, and presto, our car was always there and waiting! (I’ve waited more than 30 minutes in that sea of cars at the Hilton!) Some people resent the $30/night valet parking…well, every boutique hotel costs around that, get over it!-The total cost, after all applicable taxes is literally half the cost of the Hawaiian Hilton! I completely understand if your goal was to come to Hawaii and look down at the beach, but you can also stay here and in less than 10 minutes, walk to the beach.-I recommend the mountain view side, worth the money. The view of the Trade Winds blowing the clouds over the mountains is truly hypnotic. Avoid the “city view”, it ‘s looking straight into an apartment complex. Also 5th floor and above are better because the street traffic from Ala Wai Blvd. is less noisy and bothersome.-The rooms come with a little bar sink, you cannot believe how great that is for getting ready when “her majesty” is monopolizing the bathroom sink.However:Having stayed here under two previous owners, I was hoping that now that the Coconut is an independent, that more things would be updated. Some of the nitpicks I’m going to list (or all in total) might be a deal breaker for you, but I feel obligated to let you know.-It says it has a pool, but it’s tiny, and right by the entrance with room for about four people to lay out.-In our room our dresser was showing its age, the drawers no longer shut easily or stay shut.-The louvered windows and sliding doors have not been replaced. Good double-paned windows would go SO FAR towards outdoor knocking down street noise. Also, in our room the control crank was broken on the end louvered window, and though it was closed, it was not cranked down tight. That, combined with the fact that the hallways are not air-conditioned (!), served to create a little venturi of hot air that would come in under the (fire mandated) gap on the door, over taxing the room AC unit.-And (in our room) the AC unit was a newer, smallish, home-type bedroom window undersized unit so it had to give its all every moment to keep the room cool. In the morning it’s no big deal, but at night it was way too loud! It would have been nice to have a decent hotel-sized commercial unit. (In fairness, others in our party happened to have a commercial grade unit in their room.) You know you're not be in for a quiet evening when management provides ear plugs ahead of time (see pic). The AC unit had a “Sleep mode” but neither that nor “Energy Saver” mode could keep up, so it was full blast all day and night.-Plus, the somewhat bad installation of the AC unit (see pic) left a small crack on one side which let out a lot of our precious cold air! -Also, when they installed the thru wall AC units, why did they not plumb the condensate line? This problem is so long standing that hanging out on the balcony is not a nice experience because of all the green algae on the tile growing from the constant runoff of the AC condensate. The rails have holes in them from the constant drip, drip. The staff know all about it, they have to put an umbrella over the valet stand to shed condensate from the 10 floors of balconies above. This drives me a little bit crazy, it wouldn’t be very expensive to fix!-The bath tubs have plastic PET liners in them, so they are nice and clean and white. BUT, they are sitting over steel tubs that over time have given way in places. As a result, you spend all your time in the shower being so careful, because a step over an unsupported section causes the whole tub to loudly pop in and then out, like the world’s biggest coke bottle if you step on the wrong spot!-When it was a Joy de Vivre hotel, it had the cutest aqua, blue, and blue-green color scheme that was so unique, and the cheerful colors just made you happy looking at it. I felt like I was somewhere different and special, I felt like I was in Hawaii! The new color scheme is now very conservative in brown, off-white, red and gold accents, but is a move in the wrong direction, so blah-h-h.Does that all sound bad? If this were a hotel in Paris the locals would give an incredulous glare and say what are you complaining about? So I would probably stay here again, but if (for you) these kinds of things outweigh the Good, you’ll have to go somewhere else…and pay more, and probably get less friendly service.","Orange County, California","LigierGitan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County, California</strong>",4,4.0

Daily cleaning service was a plus (without requesting service). I say the only downsize was our room and the long walk to the beach (some parts of neighborhood is sketchy). Our executive suite was really roomy. The room had modern furniture but the room still look outdated with wall AC units. It also had an odd smell that I can't describe. The balcony is small and felt unsafe for my toddler. I think the building use to be condos. I'm not sure if I'll come back with my family here. We rather pay a little more to be closer to the beach.

Coconut Waikiki Hotel seemed to be highly recommended, so I booked us a couple nights. I mentioned our special anniversary occasion upon booking and they went way above and beyond to make our stay extraordinary! It started with a detailed reply from Jessica with a list highlighting points of interests and events happening during our stay. Then upon our early arrival, we were welcomed with aloha by Jessica and Silvia who gave us spot-on recommendations for nearby grinds to make our tummies happy while they were getting our room ready. Shootz, they really styled out our room! Everything was spectacular with special attention to all the little details. Not to mention the quality and generous amenities (included) like the breakfast buffet, comfort station, exercise room, pool, mid-day popcorn... You can't find exceptional service and value like this at the bigger, over-priced hotels. We were welcomed with personal attention during every interaction.

It was our first trip to Hawaii and I usually do my own bookings on the internet however, the prices were so inordinate that I went to the travel agent for advice. Alas, she missed the mark. We discovered we were looking for something like the Hilton Village or Moana Outrigger so the Coconut came as a disappointment. While the Executive Suite was spacious and clean it and the hotel are pretty dated (especially in the bathroom). The corridor outside our room smelled of mould or some such. The breakfast was both free and a free-for-all. I advise you eat elsewhere. But our main gripe was the noise from outside. Ear plugs had been provided in anticipation. Even so the noise level every night was incredible - so be warned! Lewers Street is a fairly seedy area too. On a positive note the staff were friendly and helpful.

This was very much appreciated as we were hanging for a nap and a hot shower.The staff were VERY accommodating. They confirmed some tours for us that we had booked and even included a little map of meeting places etc for the tours. The room was nice. Good quality bed, TV, bathroom etc and we were upgraded to a mountain view which was beautiful!After reading the reviews about the free breakfast I was a bit concerned about it but I didn't have to be. There was always plenty to eat and while it's not a huge variety, it's free and has all the basic stuff you could want or need to get you through till lunch.The only reasons I marked this hotel 4 out of 5 was because while the breakfast is good it's only from 630-830 so if you want a free feed you have to be up early or you'll miss out. The other thing was the yoghurt is left out on the bench as opposed to being kept refrigerated and as such I ended up getting food poisoning after eating it and was sick for the next 48 hours. Why something like dairy isn't better kept is beyond me but then again maybe I just had bad luck.The room also had panel windows I assume to let in fresh air etc but this also lets in a lot of street noise.Overall I would stay again in a heartbeat.

This was great as it prompted us to request adjoining/close rooms.On our arrival we were told they did not have any rooms available that were close however the penthouse was vacant so they upgraded us to the two bedroom suite. We were very surprised and grateful for this gesture!The penthouse was spacious and great to share with full kitchen and washer/dryer. Would have been handy to have some washing powder in the room so we could easily do a load of washing though.Our bedroom was good although the position of the AC meant it blew directly on our bodies so it was impossible to have a comfortable night sleep with it on. We had to open our bedroom door and put the AC on in the lounge so it would blow into our room. The pillows were also enormous and if you like a flat pillow like me, BYO. I ended up using the couch cushion as a bed pillow as my neck was aching.

I preferred to have a room in the back of the hotel which was quieter and the staff were really accommodating with any needs. The only thing which was slightly difficult was the noise from traffic, but since I stayed at the back part of the hotel, that was really helpful.

The windows and door seals allow the noise from the street below in and it is UNBELIEVABLY noisy on a weekend. Part of the windows are louvred and I checked on more than one occasion, as I was sure the window or sliding doors were open. The staff are friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast is basic and a little repetitive, but certainly adequate and beats paying top dollar for breakfast on the street. The popcorn machine is a nice touch in the afternoon. Although complimentary don't be fooled, as they do charge a $20 per night ""resort fee"" which pretty much negates the complimentary items.The hotel is close enough to the action and easy to find. Perhaps if we had a room on the other side of the building the noise may not have bothered us. We considered asking to be moved and in hindsight we should have, but hate to be a nuisance.

All day, there was free coffee, tea, hot chocolate, a variety of iced teas and in the afternoon, free popcorn too! The pool was heated so made night swims a joy and the location was excellent! Its only a short stroll to the centre of Waikiki, with all the restaurants, shops and of course, the ever stunning waikiki beach.The rooms are exceptionally clean, modern and a decent size. If you require any information, the staff are better than google!!! They know all the best places to visit, advise on the best way to get there and will print off information for you! They are always chirpy, willing to chat and ever so friendly, at all times of the day or night.

She was able to walk us through the whole process of the room, parking and surroundings. When we got to our room, our keys weren't activated properly but it just so happened that an employee was waking by who was able to help us. He was able to show us how to operate everything in our UPGRADED room and called for new cards to be ready for us. The following morning we were greeted just like the first time.

The hotel is nearby many close restaurants which was fantastic! I can go grab a light snack if I had to.The only thing I dislike was the parking. $30 for valet ??! That is nuts, knowing that my rental car was already expensive. I think Coconut should have self parking and maybe minimize the amount for valet. I find it frustrating that I have to turn in my car to rest in my hotel for an hour and come down having to wait for them to get my car out.Their resort fee is about $20 dollars a night--which it was fine, but for a decent okay hotel, I don't think resort fee should be applied.

All hotels charge parkingAmenities- FREE yummy flavored water in the lobby all day, and FREE popcorn every afternoon. REALLY good FREE breakfast too!SERVICE- The staff at this hotel feel like family to me now! They are SO professional, kind, down to earth, helpful, reliable, a few times I left something I needed in my car, and they brought it up to my hotel room for me! They gave me free bottled water when I arrived and when I left! They offered their fridge for my daughters birthday cake, with forks and plates too. FREE beach towels daily, and a small gym if you ever feel like working out on vacation. POOL- the pool is heated and is often empty so you don't have to feel like you're fighting crowds as you would in downtown Waikiki and any other large hotel chainROOM- include fridge and microwave, and dining area, and lanai. everything you need, nothing you don't. Get a canal view if you can, it is so beautiful in the morning!Above all, I recommend this hotel because it is small and you really get the boutique type service and attention that makes a world of difference in a busy city like Waikiki.

I want to leave a great review but then it will be so busy, I might not be able to get a room for the next time we come! My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay at the Coconut Waikiki. All the staff we talked to during our stay were always sooo friendly and very helpful, this is what makes or breaks a great hotel in my opinion! Isaac at the front desk was the first face we saw and gave us a complete rundown when we arrived, he seemed to always be around to give us info and tips. Breakfast bar lady that was there throughout the week (forgot her name), she was so sweet, always so cheerful and kept replacing all the food as people plowed through....she was always on it, love her! Gina did a lovely job making up our room and was so sweet with the little notes we left. Unfortunately I can't remember all the staff's names that helped but they were ALL great. It is conveniently located close to the downtown core, easy walk to everything you will need. The local bus is very handy and took us everywhere we needed to go for $2.50, $1.25 for my daughter. You can ask for a transfer when you pay for your ride and then can pop off and back on again for free within the time listed on the transfer. We did rent a smart car for a few days to see some areas further away on the island but the bus could have worked too, just takes a bit longer. This hotel offered a GREAT breakfast with lots of options which made it sooo worth it. The hotel is very clean and well maintained. The provide little extras like popcorn in the afternoon and fruit infused water you can enjoy. We filled up the little water bottles (nice size to pack around and so cute!) they provided in the room and always had infused water with us when out and about. There is a Keurig in the room with some complimentary tea/coffee options. They also provide beach towels and beach chairs at the front desk, so nice. Love that checkout is at noon, you don't have to be in a panic to get out on your last day. They were able to store our luggage on checkout day as our flights didn't leave until later that night so we could still go enjoy the day. We had a balcony with a bit of a view of the water channel that runs right behind the hotel and is a nice early morning walking/running area. The pool was lovely for when you're not at the beach. It is a great temperature to play and relax in. They had air conditioned rooms which in my opinion is mandatory if you want to be able to sleep in Hawaii!Only con would be: the room we stayed in had a couple of spots that could have used a paint touch up (by the wall sconce and light switch in bathroom had been painted over and was starting to come off) I think the hotel had recently had some renos so I figured it more of a reflection of the reno company and their lack of attention to detail. It didn't matter to us as that had no negative reflection on the stay we had.","Kelowna, Canada","2muchfun2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kelowna, Canada</strong>",8,5.0

They have a ditto map ready in hand to show you how to get you were your going local restaurants or other hotels for a show etc. the neighborhood is good and safe. There is a canal across the street that you could walk or jog those extra vacation calories off. Amazed at the amount of healthy people before 7am. The fitness gym is fair considering other hotels. ( same exact equipment:elypticle machine and threadmill. ) there is a self laundry downstairs that was helpful . It's coin operated $2.50 per washer and $2.50 per dryer. Dryers are really good( I know I know for $2.50 it should be yada yada yada) they have change and soap at the desk. I bought my small bottle of tide at the corner store. I think they wash your clothes too. I'm just use to always doing my own laundry. Room has an iron. Looking for breakfast there is a place called eggs n things. (Walking distance) Go before 7am. Looking for lunch or dinner : Slice of Waikiki . Small pizza place takeout window only( take it to your room and relax for a night""you're on vacation "". ( right down the street to your left. next to IHOP) great size slices. Whole pizza you order as you want it. ( light sauce extra extra cheese please with what ever else comes on the pizza thhmmm ) . While you wait for your pizza walk back toward IHOP and cross the street and shop for drinks and snacks. I always go to the store on the corner closest to the hotel. It seems less commercialized even though the prices are still probably the same. There is also a nice little store for drinks even closer if you continue walking towards the hotel. I think it is in a hotel next to ours. Other places I've tried: cheeseburger in paradise has huge burgers and yard house great bar and food (both located on same strip. Both within close walking distance ) more places just gps restaurants nearby then TripAdvisor them ;). Anyway things to do: north shore shark adventures picks you up at the hotel between the pizza place and IHOP I mentioned earlier. Yes swim with sharks !! It's safe I wouldn't do it if it wasn't:). The sharks are swimming by the boat and cage looking for chum that the fishing boats usually drop when their done fishing. The sharks could care less that we were in the water with them. But to see them up close is amazing . I saw old hooks on one and gashes on a tail of another one. All over 8 ft long . About 8 sharks on this dive. Pretty cool . Book the earliest first trip!!! Take a large towel to dry yourself and because it was cold that morning. Also definitely extra clothes and a plastic garbage bag in your book bag. Plus a gropo or whatever underwater camera you have with a wrist cord so you don't loose it. Have fun! Magic of Polynesia. Magic show plus fire stick twirling. Great show pay for the deluxe and get the steak dinner that comes with the show. Had better steaks but the show was amazing. Free drink included I had the island favorite LAVA FLOW. Basically it's a pina colada with strawberries mixed into it. You don't even taste the liquor. You poor unsuspecting bastards. lol I could drink those for days. I always go to this hotel. It feels safe . Would I prefer the ritzy hotels along the beach front hells yeah. But I'm saving my money for the adventures. I just needed a place to crash nearby for the night.

The hotel is very short walking distance from the beach, close to many wonderful restaurants, and also near the canal, which is a great place for a quiet walk compared to the main strip on Waikiki. They had beach towels you can bring with to the beach and there is always drinks out during the day. Note, there is no regular water after breakfast, only flavored waters and delicious pineapple tea. We stayed at the executive suite and the room was spacious and nice and clean. Bonus was the 2 bathrooms, which made life easy with a baby who is sensitive to noise and we could still use the bathroom when she was sleeping. Room equipped with microwave and fridge and sink, basic cutlery, and cups. Very convenient when we had to eat in the room or reheat leftovers, and great for baby to have hot food when we had a late day out and had to eat in the room. The breakfast service is a little limited and repetitive if you stay for a longer period. But the staff are wonderful and super nice and work their hard to keep the line full so that we can have breakfast. The hard boiled eggs go fast when they come out!! I wish there were fruit options, even whole bananas and apples to grab would have been nice.We booked through hotels.com, which stated cribs were free. However, when we called the hotel to reserve one, I was told it was a 20 dollar charge each night. That is really steep for a crib, when it is necessary for a baby to sleep in!! But, luckily, it was in my booking confirmation that the crib would be free and they did not charge me! Also, I called ahead to reserve but when we got there our first night, there was not one available. We did get one the next day, but be sure to call well in advance to reserve.

Included cereals, juice, tea, croissants, muffins, eggs and some other pastries, bread and waffles. The gym has the essentials you would need, treadmills, cross trainer, mats, gym balls, skipping rope and weights. This is not a luxury 5 start hotel so i never expected for them to have a huge gym or a huge buffet breakfast but they did exceed my expectations.

The safe in the room that you could set your own combination was a bonus. The 2 elevators were quick, even up to the 10th floor, and we never had to wait long for one or stop on lots of floors. There were games and books to borrow in the lobby for a nice added touch. My only 2 complaints were the noise and the breakfast. We could hear street noise even on the 10th floor! We complained that our curtains were being sucked toward the screen like the windows were open. To their credit, a repairman came to our room within minutes to check but said there was nothing he could do, that the windows were closed. We found that hard to believe since we could hear things as if we had had the windows open and could feel wind blowing. As for the breakfast, most places don't even include a breakfast so maybe I shouldn't complain. Breakfast only included small boxed cereal (get there very early or there may only be 1 choice), bread, pre-made waffles, muffins or crescent rolls (these too went quickly), and instant packets of oatmeal. A couple of days there were hard boiled eggs. The poor lady in the dining area had a difficult time keeping up as there frequently were no spoons, and it wasn't her fault when the food was gone. I wish there had been some fresh fruits from which to choose and also a juice machine. The juice in the pitcher was so watered down with ice. Despite these 2 complaints, I would stay there again.","Edwardsville, Illinois","kb6425</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edwardsville, Illinois</strong>",21,4.0

Because we had 2 toddlers and a baby, I was also interested in the amenities of a microwave, refrigerator and complimentary breakfast. Everyone was pleased with their rooms. The only complaint was from my daughter who said that she could hear street noise on the Ala Wai Canal side. That's pretty good coming from a group this size. I had been told that it was a 10 minute walk to the beach depending on how many stores in which you stopped to shop. That was probably true. It was also 1 block from an ABC store and 2 blocks from one of the main bus stops. Honolulu has one of the best bus systems in the world. It is monitored with GPS and you can go on line with your iPhone and know exactly what time your bus will arrive. Everyone used it with no problems. The hotel pool was fairly small but for the little ones it was better than the beach because it was bathwater warm! One evening I wanted to have a celebration dinner. I reserved their large grill and patio area. Alvida Supra-Jones, the General Manager, supplied us with BBQ utensils, ice, dinnerware and napkins. She and the desk staff were extremely helpful with all our questions. I was especially grateful when, upset by not finding corn on the cob at Walmart or Sams, was directed to a wonderful big Safeway that had everything that I wanted.","Litchfield, IL","grandma1940</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Litchfield, IL</strong>",17,5.0

Nice and quiet yet central.Considering the prices in Waikiki I think I got valueThe staff were super friendly and the free popcorn in the afternoon was awesome.The hotel was super clean, the room was a great size, the bathroom just a little small.The only thing I would say against it is the breakfast was a bit dismal but if you get it for free that's ok - just on't pay for it.Also our room wasn't as colourful as the pictures.I would totally stay there again though.I was very happy with my choice to stay there.There is a great little Irish pub and Japanese BBQ place on the street.","Wollongong, Australia","nessrocks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wollongong, Australia</strong>",18,5.0
