We are mid 60’s travellers and found the hotel great for us to walk both to Diamond Head and Down Town Honolulu.Easy checkin. The room had all it said it had. Our room was near the front so a little noisy but nothing we couldn’t handle. Staff mostly very friendly and helpful. I think the room might have benefitted from a little more attention when being cleaned especially in the bathroom, also the bottom sheet on the bed never covered the mattress! We had a great breakfast in the bar area on the last day. All in all a great little place to stay.",Suffolk,"love2holidaySuffolk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Suffolk</strong>",20,4.0

If your looking to stay close to the beach/shopping of Waikiki but also have a cozy and personalized experience this is the place! We did not want to stay at another bleached out/chain resort for our honeymoon to Hawaii, so we chose the Equus, and were not disappointed! We had a better experience than we ever thought possible for such a touristy city like Waikiki.  I'm a little bit of a pillow snob, and oh theirs were so fluffy and comfortable! Every employee, reception/bar/coffee/valet, were extremely friendly and helpful! We ended up extending our stay instead of visiting at our families home to stay with them, that's how much we loved this hotel! You cannot have a better hotel and staff that is locally owned in Waikiki, definitely a hidden gem.I will recommend this hotel to everyone that I know that is planning a trip to Oahu.",,S5750RWsarahh,0,5.0

Competent staff, professional but not friendly. Decent rooms with an odd layout sure to age of hotel but nicely remodeled. The problem... The room was not very clean. Debris everywhere, left from previous guests. No bio hazards mind you but things like safety pins and hair barrets on the floor in plain view. No the biggest problem... This place is incredibly noisy to the point of absurd. It's on a very busy street granted but there is no sound insulation at all. I have stayed in downtown hotels all over the USA and elsewhere and never anything like this. Walls are very thin to the point that conversations in the next room are totally discernable. They oddly installed commercial toilets, the airport kind that are very very loud. Whenever the people next door flushed there was a huge bang and water rush that was almost comical. I resorted to not flushing if I used the toilet in the middle of the night as not to subject my neighbors to the same. Just unacceptable. The is a small bar the is a nice gathering place and the staff that I interacted with were very nice. There is a pool that is so small and completely blocked off sunlight that I doubt it is ever used.

Room was clean, with comfy bed, coffee maker, and great shower water pressure. The front desk made sure that I got my dry-cleaning done no problem. Folks at the front desk are friendly at all times of day. When I ran out of coffee in my room (I drink excessive amounts of it), I was given more than enough extra. Free drink at the bar, and the bar staff were conversational enough to make me feel included in the scene. The cleaning staff, though I don't recall seeing them in person, were impeccable.I wouldn't describe the Equus as fancy--I believe they describe themselves as boutique, and that's fitting, it DOES have style--but the point I'm getting at is that the service I experienced was on par or superior than the service I've experienced at many larger and fancier hotels. I am willing to believe that some individuals may find the rooms to be small. For comparison, my room was larger than the Hampton Inn in New York when I attended the United Nations General Assembly, but was also smaller than my rooms at Ala Moana or Pagoda in Honolulu itself. For a simple man with simple needs, the room's size was fine. I could do everything my mobile office needed--place for the printer and scanner, place for folders and documents, and places to charge various devices. While that's the case for me, I am known to use hotel beds as my work station instead of the chair and desk (with pillows supporting my arms), and although I don't believe it's NECESSARY to do that I note this because it may not be a common practice, but it DOES result in more space being utilized elsewhere.For those unfamiliar with the setting, while I'm sure there are touristy things around--I've been to Hawaii dozens of times and I've never been to the beach--the key points for me is easy access to roads and likely meeting sites, and plenty of nearby shops when you need office supplies or 2am sushi from an ABC Store.I am pretty sure that, at some point, Hawaii will have more ABC Stores than people.In conclusion, I would recommend Paniolo at the Equus to anyone in Hawaii who needs simple accommodation and simple services performed in an exemplary manner.

This botique hotel was the perfect location - close but not too close to the Waikiki madness. It is located within easy walking distance of the Ala Moana shopping center, Ala Moana park, Waikiki & Hawaii Yacht Clubs, and Waikiki. The gps in my rental car didn't know how to find this place & had me driving in circles before I was able to ID the correct location. It's not easy to see this place wedged in between a couple larger structures. There is no self parking so expect to pay a daily rate if you have a car. They also charge a resort fee which seems to be standard in Waikiki. Taken together, however, the room rate was freaky good. So good in fact, it had me little worried about what I would find. The staff were all very nice. I saw other reviews about a free drink on check in. I never saw a free drink, but I can't fault them there.My room was a nice & clean, but the carpet could use a shampoo. I was pleased to find the room was not at all musty smelling (very common in Hawaii). The shower might be a sqeeze for a person of some girth, but fine for me. I appreciated the eco-friendly measures and products (although I thought the toiletry fragrance was a little on the funky side). The room had a fridge and a K-cup coffee machine (K-cups aren't so eco-friendly). As mentioned by other reviewers, you need to climb a set of stairs to get to the lobby. If you have lots of bags, this could be a challenge. That said, the valet offered to cart my luggage which I declined. Although all the valet workers were all VERY nice, there were some long wait times to get my car. Anyone staying here should be aware that Ala Moana is noisy...24 hrs/day (especially when the booze trolley is in the area). Try to get a room as far back from Ala Moana if street noise is a problem for you. Almost forgot....they put yam cookies in my room.

I will try to write this review from a fact based, and non-subjective place and outline the terrible experience. When we first arrived, we were able to check in early which was greatly appreciated as we had reservations at the Pearl Harbor Memorial for the USS Arizona. When we got the room it was very nicely put together, very cute, and perfect for the two of us. The bed was very comfortable and the amenities offered came in the form of the minifridge and a nice little bar. We discovered a pile of a previous guests clothing inside one of the dressers, and politely asked them to be removed. The manager was very gracious in her handling of this, and offered to waive the parking fee for the night and we explained we did not have a car, so she waived the resort fee. This is important to note because it comes back up later. We did rent a car from the adjacent Enterprise location on June 31st and returned it on June 1st early AM. Vehicle parking at the hotel is $29 a night. I will now break down the pros and cons of the hotel.Pros:-Very nice cozy environment, very much a boutique hotel. -Locally owned and run. -The morning cafe turns into an evening bar, with a complimentary drink offered. -Close by to various restaurants. Cons:-Must ask front desk for ice, no ice machine. -The elevator can take a very long time to reach your level. -Room service starts early in the morning (I understand this is a logistics thing). -Pool was very cold, unfortunately it doesn't get much sun. -One of their valets, named Jun, was asleep when we went to pick up our rental car.All in all, we enjoyed our stay and were happy to be supporting a locally owned boutique hotel instead of a giant chain. That all changed on the day we checked out. After we had checked out, I received an invoice for our stay. On the invoice it added an additional four days of vehicle parking, which would have been for the entire duration of our stay rather than the two days we had the rental car. I called and brought the mistake to the hotels attention, and the first clerk I spoke to directed me to a manager. Through dialogue with her, she stated that we had a registered vehicle with them the entire stay. I disputed this, but she dug her heels in and was unrelenting and unable to listen to me. I was told I needed to provide them with solid proof that I only had a vehicle for the two days, or they were going to keep the full 6-day charge on my account. I received an email from Kika where she claimed that I had two separate vehicles registered, including the rental car being ascribed to the wrong nights. I emailed her back to explain that she had the incorrect nights for the rental car, and explained that it was just the singular vehicle. She responded by saying that she had me on camera with two vehicles, and further ignored my claims and stood by her fraudulent claims. At this point I contacted Enterprise and asked them to send me over the contract agreement and a receipt for the rental, as well as began organising the Lyft receipts to and from their hotel. My partner called Kika directly and reexplained that we only ever had one car, not two like they claimed. They said we had one vehicle for the first two nights and then the other vehicle for the last four, my partner stated that there must have been a mistake because the only time we had a car was for two nights in the middle of our stay, and that we had the rental car invoice and copies of our Lyft receipts to back all of that information up. Kika was rude and argumentative, kept insisting that we were in the wrong even when we had a clear paper trail to prove they overcharged us. Then Kika refused to continue to talk to my partner and just kept repeating ""I'm not saying you're lying, even if you did have two cars there we will just take your word for it I guess"" We said its not about taking our word for it we have proof and aren't trying to get away with not paying for something we received, were just trying to right a mistake you made.I emailed Kika a copy of the Enterprise contract that clearly stated the accurate dates for the rental car, and she acknowledged them and removed the overcharge on the invoice with the smallest of apologies possible. My warning to anyone who stays here:PLEASE check your invoice they send you after, they tried to scam us with fraudulent charges and Kika was an absolutely terrible Director of Operations. I have never experienced anything like this before, and I would hate to see them get away with potentially overcharging future guests. I'm not sure where the issue or mistake started on their end, but it should have been on Kika to have diplomatically worked with us to resolve it through the basic abilities of customer service. Instead we had to deal with a stone wall of rudeness, and an aggressive sense of digging their heels in on their own mistake.","Los Angeles, California","James I</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",8,3.0

Since it was a last-minute booking, there weren't many reasonable options left in Honolulu. However, this boutique hotel was great in price and reviews were also good so decided to give it a try and I wasn't disappointed.Yes, the parking for the hotel is small and valet only and costs $29+tax/day which is pretty standard on Oahu. The valet guys were very friendly and had no troubles getting my car. It's just a short flight of stairs up to the lobby.There is a resort fee also of $18/day which has now become the norm for hotels. This hotel has a small bar area and small pool on the lobby level. The lobby is also small, but comfortable and the front desk people were also friendly and ready to help.It's a small hotel so noticed just the one elevator, so found it usually just as fast to use the stairs since I was on the 4th floor. The rooms were nice and spacious with a big four-post bed. The room also had a couple of chairs for a seating area. The lanai was a nice size but looked out over nothing so didn't spend time out there. The room also came with a Keurig one-cup coffeemaker with coffee, sugar, cream and coffee cups. There's also a mini fridge and freezer so perfect for storing ice cream. The room shows signs of usage, but nothing alarming, just a few stains on the carpet here and there and nicks on the furniture but was cleaned well.The bathrooms were nice. They included the regular bath amenities (although I didn't care for the smell of them). The shower though is a little tight so for anyone over 6' tall or more than 200 pounds may feel a little claustrophobic in there. There's also a closet that included an iron and ironing board, hairdryer, extra linens and a safe (the key for the safes are located at the front desk).Overall I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend staying there again. It is a relatively short walk to Ala Moana and the beach. There's also restaurants and other shops within walking distance. It's close enough to Waikiki, yet just outside of it to get out of the main hustle and bustle.","Kauai, Hawaii","dakosh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kauai, Hawaii</strong>",89,5.0

Room is very clean and pretty decent size. Location was great too. However if you get a room by Ala Moana Blvd you may regret of staying there. Street noise was terrible and even after midnight it didn't stop. I have stayed at many places in Waikiki and it can get loud. I have to say it was the worst street noise I have experienced at any hotels even with ear plugs. I'm not one of those who ask for different room because staff can't control street noise and don't want to ruin nice vacation mood but if you decide to stay there you should make sure it's not by main street. I decided to stay there because of all nice reviews but I don't think they had room by street. Also you should be aware anybody can go up to your room without being seen by staff because elevator is located right next to stairs from main street and staff at check in desk can't see who is coming in. I hate to leave not positive review because this is out of their control but I'll pay more for quieter hotel.,san diego,"junechild</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>san diego</strong>",114,2.0

Upon my arrival, I was greeted by a most helpful parking attendant, who took care of my vehicle, as I checked into this boutique hotel. At check in, I was made to feel like I was a VIP, by the extremely friendly staff. The beautifully renovated lobby / lounge area, did not go unnoticed, nor did the cleanliness of the property. I opted to take the short elevator ride, up to the floor where I would be staying (7). Gained entry to my room, without any problems (secure swipe card access). I was pleased to discover the energy conservation efforts that are in place (when not in your room, simply remove key card from the wall port, and the lights & air conditioning power down). The layout of the room, is well thought out, plenty of space to move about (including the spacious washroom), a bar fridge with drink prep station on the counter above, extremely plush beds and lounge seating, an entertainment centre, and your room specific complementary WiFi access. The theme of the hotel (Polo, Horses, and Hawaii), is maintained throughout, with personal touches from the owners. I slept undisturbed, all night, in the completely occupied hotel. As I ventured out, in the early hours, to make the scenic walk to the starting area of the marathon, I received well wishes from the front desk staff, which was a nice touch. Checkout time was perfect, giving me plenty of time to get back from the finishing area, eat, shower, and pack. I have yet to have a negative experience, at this fine accommodation, in Honolulu, and would not hesitate to recommend this place, to anyone looking for a great, authentic, comfortable, and friendly place to stay, while visiting Oahu.

Having worked in the hotel industry for over 20years, I’m a hotel junkey and love exploring other properties. We are a local couple who live and work here in Hawaiʻi. Originally from a paniolo town on Hawaiʻi island, I thought this would be a cool little hotel to try out. Positives: - Economically priced - Friendly staff, Megan @ c/i, & I believe Darryl is his name at valet (could be mistaken on name though) both were very friendly- Location- Loved the theme of the property- Like the fact that they are attempting to go greenNegatives: - Entrance door handle had issues opening from arrival, informed someone at the front when I was heading out for the evening, but the handle seemed the same when I returned. - TV issues, had to have maintenance fix that.- Bed is way too soft, my boyfriend & myself barely slept because the bed was so soft our backs were hurting all night. - Four post bed with the top was a bit much especially being tall people. I’m guessing all the beds must be like this since I did inform at check in that my boyfriend was very tall, to make sure we got a queen or king bed. - AC very week.- Walls are thin, heard the traffic all night long - Was not informed at check in or at the reception that the “valet” would not be available before 6am. Because of this we had to hunt for someone from the hotel to grab our car key & tell us where the car was located, which resulted in the boyfriend to be late for work.- Safety, there is no elevator key access. The elevator is easily accessible from the street and no one is even around when you walk up the stairs at night and enter the property. I’m sure there must be cameras or security, but I didn’t notice them at all. More than likely we probably wouldn’t stay here again. This could be a really cute boutique hotel but there are some minor things that need to be addressed. I gave it a 3 mainly because I know how harsh a 1 or 2 does to a hotels rating overall.
