Read the reviews of the first two who stayed here. Notice the others who wrote reviews only have 1 each. They all sound alike. There is no such place. It’s your own fault if you let them SCAM you ,,Swifty2399,1,1.0

The location for starters is PRIME. Close to everything, several very cool and delicious restaurants, a CVS right downstairs, grocery store right across the street, Times Square just a couple blocks away. The unit itself was sparkling clean and had everything we needed. Full kitchen with everything we needed to cook up a few meals. The unit even provides umbrellas which we found very convenient while traveling. It was ideal to have 2 bedrooms for the family with 2 king beds. THE VIEW was the cherry on top. This is a very special place. Highly recommend!",,432sharifk,1,5.0
