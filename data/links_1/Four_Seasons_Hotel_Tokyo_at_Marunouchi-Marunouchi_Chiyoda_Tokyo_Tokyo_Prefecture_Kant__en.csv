Someone is always there to refill your water and coffee, and they come by your table with fresh apple jam (that they make in-house) served in a scooped-out apple.

Our main reason why we stayed here again was because of the location,right outside Tokyo st. Rooms have a decent space compared with what Japan spaces are. They are comfy, clean and super quiet. Unless you have a crying child as a neighbor. However for the second time we confirmed that the service during breakfast is terrible. If you want to order pancakes be prepared and have enough time because they will tell you that will take 30min. Also 30min for a bowl of oatmeal and 10min for coffee. And this was not just one day, this was every day that we stay there. Waitresses get distracted very easily even though sometimes there was only a few tables occupied, they’ll give you the oatmeal but forgot to give you sugar, raises or what ever. However the concierge service is one of the best if not the best. There was nothing we’ll can ask for that they provide. We arrived from Beijing sick and they even took us personally to the clinic. They help us with our luggage and took us to the Shinkansen st. and pick us up on our way back. Although location, rooms and concierge are superb.

The same restaurant at nighttime has a lounge with a nice view, great for a nightcap. We were leaving for Kyoto and Mari asked us how we’re flying back. Once I told her we were taking the train back to Tokyo station and then switching to the Narita express, she made sure to get our tickets and arrange for someone to meet us on our return to guide us to the Narita express.

It's small, bare bones, tired, and depressing looking property that appears to exist only as hotel of convenience for nearby businesses. I booked here without reading all the reviews, figuring that I couldn't go wrong with a Four Seasons. Believe me, I went wrong. Read some of the other 3 star and less reviews, and you'll notice a common theme of people feeling ripped off. Add me to the list. The hotel is on the bottom few floors of a nondescript boring glass office building. There is no main entrance on the street, you arrive by driving down what looks to be a service road that leads into the building's parking garage. Go on Google street view and take a look. Taxis that picked us up here had to literally drive down into and out of the parking garage to turn around. A warm welcome this isn't. The lobby is so sad. It's the size of a two car garage, with a tiny front desk just barely big enough for 2 people. It looks like the checkin desk at an airport gate, except smaller. The decor in the lobby, and throughout the hotel, is 1990s corporate on a tight budget. Our room was small, dated, and generic. In addition to the fake wood laminate on the walls, there was also some fake wood that looked like formica. It was well worn, as were the leather cushions on the bench, which were scuffed from years of use. I've literally stayed in Mariott Courtyard rooms that were nicer. There are no good views. The bathroom was nice, that's the only thing that looked modern. There was actual real stone in the bathroom. The AC worked fine, although there was a small plastic dehumidifier in the corner of the room that was running the whole time. How weird is that? It made me wonder what the problem was that they had to solve it by plugging in a dehumidifier. I've never seen that in a hotel before.Breakfast was shockingly bad. The entire breakfast buffet is set out on a small table, maybe 10 feet long, and they don't replenish things very often, if at all. One morning when I arrived, they had two tiny muffins left on the tray. When I left, the same two tiny muffins were there. Bread was prepackaged sliced bread, like Wonder bread. Seriously, this was the worst hotel breakfast I've ever seen, bar none. Maybe if you order a la carte it's better. I don't even eat breakfast, just coffee, but still this was crazy bad. The hotel location says ""Ginza"", but it's actually about a 20 minute walk to the main 4-Chome intersection. There's a subway stop about 5 minutes away, which is convenient. It's also convenient to the train station, which is right next door.The only good thing about this hotel was the staff was typical Four Seasons quality, meaning they were very nice, helpful, and warm. They seemed very used to dealing with complaints. The experience of staying here was as if you took a typical Four Seasons staff and had them work at a derelict Holiday Inn Express property. And to top it off, you pay a hefty bill. When I left, I felt like I had been swindled. There's no way this can be considered a ""five star"" hotel. Not even close. If you're used to the Four Seasons experience, I recommend staying at the Peninsula or Mandarin in Tokyo to find it. The Four Seasons should just close this property, it's ridiculous.","New York City, New York","BillGibson1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",99,1.0

Finding ourself exhausted from the flights and/or a day of walking exploring the city, going back to the hotel was just like going back to our home. Being greeted by everyone in the lobby, felt wonderful. We traveled with my 7yo son and he went home with full of memories. He was treated like a VIP, despite the hotel was labeled as Business Hotel, but we didn’t treated differently as w’re on leisure. Everyone still do their best to make us comfortable. My son feels that he’s an important guest as everyone always ask how he was, wether he feels comfortable and happy in the hotel. For us, our children’s comment are most important as they’re pure and honest. It really matters for every traveling family that some hotel might missed this details, but FS Marunouchi proven did not missed it!The hotel’s greatest treasure are the people, they’re genuinely kind and friendly. I may not remember everyone’s name as i must say everyone has been great to us and we can’t thank them enough. But i would specially thank Mr. Kim in the concierge for his endless assistance! We’re amaze on how humble he is and he has greatly showed us great hospitality gesture. We will never forget him,he is surely a gem for the hotel. And also Ms. Midori at the Spa for helping me wrapping my last minute souvenir shopping :) she’s such a wonderful lady and sweet. Nevertheless, I thank everyone for making our stay memorable and making my little man, feels special and come home with such a pleasant memories.

The disappointments about this property are many. This hotel should be removed from the AE fine hotels program. Immediately.First, It is not a five star hotel. The people are friendly and helpful but I do not have anything else positive to say. The Four Seasons in Tokyo is a apartment building. Not a hotel. It is a office tower with rooms on floors 4-7 over looking the train tracks of Tokyo Station. Upon arriving you are down an alley way. It is obscure and uninviting. It really presents as an apartment building. The lobby is nothing more than a front desk checkin and a concierge desk. The bar and restaurant are located on the 7th floor and have been empty. The Mandarin Oriental by comparison is a true 5 star hotel that has a wow factor that can not be beat. The management should head over there to see what 5 star hotels should be. The room we were originally given was apparently an upgrade but was small and without a view. For the last nights stay we were upgraded to a larger suite but over looking the train tacks from the 4th floor. The furnishings are old and tired and look cheap. The safe in the room looks to be from the 90's. The ""spa"" is not worth the call. Appointments for services were difficult to get and the spa itself was sub par to say the least. The hotel should not be offered as a Four Seasons. It is rare to be this upset with a property not to mention the Four Seasons brand but this will not stand with me. I have contacted AE Centurion services and voiced my concerns as it is not fair to contact the AE travel program and get stuck in a property that is clearly not what it was or ever wanted to be for a trip of this magnitude.

Hurricane Jebi delayed our arrival by a day and the earthquake on Hokkaido extended our stay two nights.

We were consistently addressed by name at Reception and at the Motif restaurant at breakfast which was included in our rate. The hotel concierge advised us that the best way to the National Museum near the Ueno Station was to take the JR train, not the subway. My wife enjoyed a fabulous Spa treatment. We enjoyed an evening drink in the bar overlooking Marunouchi and lights as the trains zipped in and out of Tokyo Station.Our room and the hotel was wonderfully quiet. With the translucent curtains open, beautiful afternoon light streamed into the living room area. At night with the drapes lowered, the room was darkened for great night's sleep. The bed and linens were as heavenly as we remembered from our first visit 3 years earlier. The bathroom contained a separate bathtub and shower. The weather was warm and humid during our stay and the hotel's central location made it easy to go in and out to cool off and fresh up. The room temperature and fan speed was easily adjustable allowing us to make adjustments to suit our preference during the day and night.When it came time to leave, Reception sent two team members to assist us with our luggage through the maze of Tokyo Station to the Narita Express platform down to the exact car.

I was really fooled by these folks and will think twice about the 5 star ratings people give to hotels when I’m considering properties for vacation. Let me make it easy for those of you who are thinking of paying for a 5 Star stay here: Rooms are severely outdated. I repeat... Severely OUTDATED. Like by 20 years. The floors have scratch marks all over, the walls have this ugly dark wood with light brown highlights, the tiles in the floor of the shower don’t properly fit so they lean in different directions when you step on them, the shower has mold stains (check the photos), the TVs are fitted with 3D and blu-ray DVD capability (what year was that cool- I forget), the AC controls are from 1982, old smelly carpets, wires from in room appliances are in plain sight,and there is no pool. The shower head is the size of a baseball, (no “rain” shower ), the toilets don’t have a flush button( unlike 95% of toilets in Japan- even ones in public restrooms), and even tho the bed is comfortable for me- this “Four Seasons” hotel is a scam. The service is the saving grace for this hotel. Mr. Yura, a manager at the hotel, was extremely patient in listening to our complaints and did what he could to make it right for us. But avoid this place If you’re looking for a 5 Star experience. I give it a 2 because of the people who work at the hotel but the hotel itself needs to be renamed cause it is most certainly not even close to par with the Four Seasons brand. I was upgraded to a higher category room and I’m still so disappointed. It’s just more old worn down stuff in a larger space /area. What was Four Seasons thinking?! On what planet is this a 5 star hotel? If they were charging 35,000 yen per night, this hotel would make ALOT more sense. But 100k yen per night is a complete scam. ABSOLUTELY AVOID!! If you want to spend on a 5 star hotel, I would seriously consider the Ritz Carlton. I stayed there when I first landed in Tokyo and can assure you that you will be 1000000x more satisfied( very similar pricing btw the two properties). **I do want to reiterate that the people who work at this hotel were attentive to our needs and tried to help as much as possible.

This hotel was just perfect. We had a short two night stopover in Tokyo on our way from the US back to Sydney. We approached Tokyo station, tired from our flight and a bit uncomfortable by the heat and humidity of Tokyo. Waiting at our train carriage door was Yosuke. This smiling young man was grabbing our bags and putting them onto his luggage cart to escort us to the hotel. He stacked our four 32kg bags and started leading the way, even as the flat tyre of his cart squeaked and he had to push harder to make progress. We offered (and were declined) to take at least one bag, and then finally insisted to take one each. He kept smiling, despite the oppressive heat and humidity. We were welcomed at the front desk by the most friendly staff imaginable, and offered a cold and refreshing drink. Check in was efficient, and we were in our room before we knew it. We were disappointed that an upgrade was not available (a benefit, although not a guaranteed one of booking through virtuoso), but were not disappointed by our room. Beautiful, modern furnishings made our premier room perfect anyway. The bathroom was very large as well (I think the room was over 60m2). Others have mentioned outside noise heard from the rooms (from trains?) and also of outdated and tired decor, I can only assume they were staying elsewhere as we found the rooms quiet and well appointed. The shower had excellent pressure and I could have spent hours in there!Breakfast at Motif was wonderful. Although its a very small buffet, they make up for size in quality of the food. We especially enjoyed the confit fruit ""jams"" provided at the table. Service was exceptional. We had drinks at the living room. I tried their ""truffly tini"". A fun twist on a classic cocktail. I also had a Japanese whisky tasting with our bartender, Satoshi.

Sure, well designed, but completely uninspiring. The room was nice and very spacious, but again, nothing special. The size of the bathroom was probably my favorite part.

The selection of food is very limited. Do not book a rate including breakfast. The food court in Tokyo Station has much better food. Also, there is a Tully Coffee Shop right below the hotel underground. Again, the service at breakfast is appalling. An hour before the end of breakfast time, staff starts to prepare the room for lunch. They don’t focus on the guests. Perhaps the worst breakfast I have had in many years. Food at bar time was so-so.

Next, the people are some of the best - their service standards and care skills towards guests is exemplary, and that's after 2.5 weeks in Japan where we experienced world-class service standards (setting a new standard in our travels). The staff here - from the front desk - check in experience - follow up on questions - concierge - bartender - the the entire service staff at their restaurant, Motif - amazing. We didn't have a single experience that was less that impressive.The only reason I'd ""ding"" the rating a bit is the property is beginning to look a bit tired and dated. We have stayed in many Four Seasons properties around the world and this is the least impressive facility. The lobby is very plain and that is the fanciest part of the entire place. Rooms are a bit worn (we had two rooms, a suite and connecting room for our kids). This is not the Four Seasons quality you would expect if you visit their other properties.We spent the first week of our trip at the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo (and then the Ritz in Kyoto after that). The Ritz facility is vastly superior to the Four Seasons - it's not even close.

Room cancellation mistake - friend had emailed to ask concierge to cancel a sushi booking in fukuoka for him and keep another (he was planning a day trip for this specifically)- member of reservations team replied saying the ROOM had been cancelled and a penalty would be charged due to sakura season likely misunderstanding the email- friend clarified that it was a RESTAURANT booking to be cancelled and advised in no way did he say he wanted room cancelled- outcome: we were upgraded to suite for 2 nights2. Wrong sushi restaurant booking cancelled - after the above had been rectified, the same member of staff proceeded to cancel the sushi restaurant booking - however for some reason, the one cancelled was the one friend had planned his entire trip for - to understand the gravity of the situation, this sushi chef is ranked as one of, if not, the best in japan, usually fully booked MONTHS in advance and it is widely considered impossible to get a booking again until months later- the mistake was not realised until friend arrived at FS tokyo and wanted to confirm his bookings; the fury was there as it was the basis of his trip and the emails were double checked on his part for any error, of which there were none. - outcome: -- from the chef we understood the general manager called him and gave it his all with sincerity to request for the chef to allow one more pax for that day; chef also asked that friend not to hold it against FS Tokyo and stay there again in future (you can imagine what went down over that phone call)-- for anyone familiar with similar establishments in Japan you will understand how much effort that would have taken the FS GM and hence appreciate it -- it worked since friend had the sushi meal of his life (I kid you not) and enjoyed it tremendously - we were also given 1 night stay complimentary as it was not until quite late the night before he was due to travel when they could confirm they had managed to get a seat There were smaller things too:- service was exemplary henceforth - late check out was issued without hassle - all staff could address friend by name on sight A small niggle but may I suggest, whilst I understand the focus was to repair the relationship with one of the guests, it would have been proper to address and acknowledge both by name. It was slightly strange and bemusing to both of us that one of us was ornamental when we were together.To conclude, still an excellent hotel located just next to Tokyo station, connected to it and Daimaru by a staircase leading downstairs right outside. Walkable to Ginza area and several metro stations within 10-15 mins. Pleasant, safe upscale area mainly populated by large MNCs and their workers hence compared to their sister properties in HK and Russia perhaps not as centrally located for leisure travellers. Room wise, ask for those away from the train station for quieter sleep, their pillow menu and mattress toppers are to die for. Bathrooms were beautiful both in their suite and premier corner room, the window views in particular of the latter were spectacular.The pick up service for those arriving at Tokyo station is a treat especially for first timers, do not miss it. Will be returning soon, if only for the feat of service they displayed this time.

It's not awful but I definitely prefer Park Hyatt Tokyo or Mandarin Oriental Tokyo which I had pleasure to stayed at. I remember awhile back, I stayed at Four Seasons Hotel at Chinzanso which was lovely. It had a beautiful garden. Unfortunately it has now been rebranded as Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo so I thought I would give this Four Seasons a try. This one is literally right next to the train tracks which unfortunately I can hear from my room all day and night. The hotel put up four panes of glass but you can still hear it. While it is at a very convenient location when compare to the Chinzanso one, but there is absolutely no soul at this hotel. It's a business hotel just like the one at Palo Alto. Although at least the Palo Alto one has a decent lobby. This one has a tiny check in counter and a small reception area that they might as well eliminate. The room finishes is dated like the one at Four Seasons New York. 1990s is calling and they want the blond wood finishes back. The breakfast buffet selection is also limited when compare to what I had at Mandarin Oriental or Park Hyatt. Most of the time, I don't put Park Hyatt and Four Seasons in the same category even though Park Hyatt likes to lump itself with Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental. In this case, unfortunately, Four Seasons Tokyo is below Park Hyatt Tokyo. Service standard is still high at this Four Seasons but it's the facility that was a great let down. The best place to stay for me in terms of location and facility is definitely Mandarin Oriental. The only reason you will want to stay at this Four Seasons is because you have a late night flight into Haneda and need to catch a bullet train to other parts of Japan the following morning.",san francisco,"kevinh73</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>san francisco</strong>",110,3.0

The common room has its own bathroom (heated toilet seat; desk space) and TV. There were electric blinds and curtains throughout for privacy. The king bed mattress, topper & pillows were extremely comfortable. There were plenty of closet space and drawers. There was turn-down service. The hotel only has 6 floors with the restaurant and spa on the 7th floor. We did not use the spa or have dinner at the hotel. There was no discernible outside noise factor.  Upon arrival, hotel personnel was able to greet us at the bus stop (Narita airport to near Tokyo Station) which was a 3 minute walk to the hotel; you will need to contact hotel for this service. It is much easier to take the bus or train from the airport to the hotel.  We had breakfast at the restaurant (7th floor) almost every morning. It is a continental breakfast with the same menu everyday - it would be nice if this was changed up every so often. They do have a Japanese breakfast which consisted of a cooked salmon, rice and some side dishes; you need to order this from the menu but it's included if you have the bed & breakfast package. The food was really good and the service with exceptional.  The hotel is part of a larger commercial building which is common with the Four Seasons hotel. It is a 4-5 minute walk to Tokyo Station (regular trains, buses and bullet train). Tokyo ""subway"" has many different lines so be sure to get a good subway map - which has both the letters and numbers of the station. Please get a portable wi-fi (eg.

In poor weather, you can get to the department stores, restaurants, and shops in Tokyo Station, without ever going outside. Food in the Four Seasons is delicious, although quite pricey. The onsen and massage are other options for making your stay a lovely experience, and the deep soak tub in your hotel bathroom gives you an especially convenient way to relax. We chose the Four Seasons Marunouchi back in 2013 as one of the few hotels with two queen beds, with a good location for catching trains to various sightseeing spots around Tokyo.

With a convenient location, solid hard product, and warm, genuine service, it's hard to beat the FS Tokyo. The property is ideally situated, just steps from Tokyo station. For a Four Seasons, this hotel is relatively unassuming and at just 57 rooms, it feels like a boutique hotel, which makes for a pleasantly intimate stay without compromising on luxury. Upon check-in, I was upgraded to an executive suite, which was extremely spacious, featuring a living room/desk area, bedroom, a guest powder room, plenty of storage/closet space, and views overlooking the train tracks. It doesn't sound particularly glamorous, but it was actually pretty enjoyable to watch all the different trains zip by. Soundproofing was excellent - the noise was minimal and I wasn't bothered at all. I also loved the decor, which struck the perfect balance of elegance and minimalism. As always, the bed was very comfortable, and I enjoyed relaxing in the living room as well. I was also pleasantly surprised by the minibar, which featured an array of teas, some interesting fresh-squeezed juices (including yuzu), and a Nespresso machine equipped with a milk frother, with fresh milk in the refrigerator. I also couldn't resist purchasing the cute (albeit pricy) teddy bear that was perched on the minibar shelf. Amenities were quite good as well, with high-quality slippers, Etro toiletries, pyjamas, and a snack plate with fresh fruit and some tasty sweets. I ended up eating breakfast and lunch at Motif, their sole restaurant, which offers quality cuisine with some decent views of the surrounding area. The Japanese breakfast was excellent, and I enjoyed the uni pasta that I tried during lunch. However, I did wish they had some more traditional options to choose from. Service was wonderful in all aspects. The concierge was very helpful and responsive, helping to secure a dinner reservation with just a few hours' notice and dealing with a bit of email back-and-forth while I was out during the day. The station escort service was a thoughtful touch and I highly recommend it. I booked my trip pretty last-minute so I didn't end up using the arrival service, but I did take up their offer to be escorted to the Narita Express station upon check-out, which ended up being super convenient. The very friendly staff member assisted me with my luggage, reserving my seat (and even scrolling through all the screens to find the best seat), and guiding me through the maze that is Tokyo station all the way to the platform where my train car was.","San Francisco, California","Oliver L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",27,5.0

All you need to do is to let the concierge know a day in advance and advice of arrival time. Staff meet you at the station with a luggage trolley and take you to the hotel. The location is very good, you are 10 mins walk from Ginza and the Fish Market. Imperial Palace is on the back of the hotel (5 mins walk) and it is well connected to other parts of Tokyo and the airport by train, metro as well as buses.The check in was quick both times, second time the staff remembered where we visited in Japan and asked us about our travels which was a nice touch. The rooms are very specious with a view of the train station. Each room has a 3D tv and guests can rent 3D movies for free. That was great way to relax after a day of sightseeing in Tokyo.The absolute highlight of our stay was their spa and onsen area. Their hot-spring bath was fantastic, gym well equipped and changing area had lovely cosmetics, from make-up remover to rose oils, face creams and body lotions.Breakfast was included in our room rate and consisted of a la carte selection (eggs cooked to order, Japanese pancake, french toasts) and American buffer. Buffet was on a small size and I would expect a much better selection from a five star hotel. There were fruit, a small selection of breads and cuts of cold meat. Overall we had a lovely stay in this hotel and would recommend it to other travellers.The only reason why we gave it 4/5 was because their concierge service was shocking. It was one of the worst concierge services we've ever had in hotels. Whenever we needed transport recommendations he just told us to take taxis (at the cost of £50/£70 each way) and told us that there are no metro or train options which was not true. He didn't know any of the local restaurants and overall struggled with our queries. I gave up after the first stay. The hotel should look at his training or replacement.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","patrycja212</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",239,4.0

I also requested them to make Japanese restaurant reservations for us and they book one with Michelin star (Ginza Okuda) which was phenomenal and one with amazing city view (Kozune, at Park Hyatt) where both the food and service was excellent. The people at concierge desk I was communicating with were Misato (Suzuki), Akhil (Tiwari) and Xing (Huang). The hotel itself also has a great restaurant where we had dinner on the day we arrived to Japan. We also had breakfast there on each morning and could enjoy the bird's view of the Shinkanzens passing by. Whether you want to discover Tokyo by public transport or taxi, the hotel is well located as it is next to Central Station. Ginza district with all the shopping options is also very close. One day, one of the hotel employees walked to the station with us to help buying train tickets and explaining which route to take (sorry for forgetting his name). The rooms are sufficiently big and clean. Check in was smooth and when I wanted to give tip for bringing our luggage to the room the hotel employee (again, sorry for not remembering his name) told us that it is not customary in Japan to give tip at hotels, restaurants and taxis and they are perfectly happy with an ""arigatou"" (thank you).

Throughout the week every member of the team went out of their way to help and from starting the day with breakfast and finishing with a nightcap in the bar, every interaction was a pleasure. Whilst one might expect this of most hotels it was the above and beyond's that make a difference. Being shown the way through the maze that is Tokyo Station by a team member to ensure we could to the right train in the quickest time was a massive help. Likewise, the enthusiasm shown by the staff to help organise tickets for baseball even given seat suggestions was fantastic. Being more boutique in nature also added to the experience as unlike mammoth hotels we felt we got to know a number of the staff and being greeted by name just makes the experience that bit more special.The hotel itself is superbly located for Ginza and other nearby department stores and retail activities but the direct access to Tokyo Station was fantastic for days were we ventured out exploring all that Tokyo has to offer.I'm not sure when we will next be back in Tokyo but will certainly return to the Four Seasons when we do.

We debated for a long time about where to stay in Tokyo and I'm so glad we made this choice. It is a boutique hotel, so it is about intimate service and an amazing room - not a spacious lobby. If you're looking for private in the city - this is it. We were two adults and two children (it's hard to find one room for that number in Tokyo) and we all fit easily in the two queen room. There was plenty of room for them to add a rollaway bed as well. We were on a corner, and a higher floor, but otherwise it was a standard room. And it was amazing!! On the corner, two entire walls were floor to ceiling windows, giving us an amazing view of the city toward Ginza area as well as the trains coming in and out (no, we heard no noise at all). It was stunning to have the walls of windows (and an easy touch of a button closed privacy shades and/or blackout curtains. Huge room and bathroom. My parents traveling with us had a connecting king room - and they had a very large sitting area - these are not your typical city-size hotel rooms. They are incredibly large even by US standards. We were there a week, and if you can get the breakfast rate, do it! (If you can't, definitely try breakfast there anyway.) The breakfast was full buffet with western and Japanese options. Amazing juice options each day. The adults in our group went to dinner at the hotel restaurant once, and it was simply incredible! French cuisine, with some Japanese flavors. Staff spoke perfect English, which was a nice way to ease into our long trip in Japan. The location is amazing - we used public transportation the whole time. People said Tokyo Station (which is right next door) would be intimidating, but we found it pretty easy - but we've traveled a lot. If you've handled the UK underground and train lines, this is pretty much the same concept - it really wasn't hard, although the hotel concierge is more than willing to get you a taxi. Tokyo Station and surrounding area also had a million places to eat in every price range. I can't imagine a better location from which to explore Tokyo. We were traveling for a while, so needed to do a large amount of laundry before leaving - and the concierge pointed us to a coin laundry (it was a couple of metro stops away, but doable). They even had a printout about it - so don't be shy about asking. The cold waters as we departed and arrived at the hotel every day were wonderful. The spa and onsen were lovely and private. My 10-year-old daughter was welcome in the spa area, which was a treat for her as many hotels have age limits. To be fair, we were the only people in there every time we used it, so I don't know if that had something to do with it. Wonderful to have a hot soak and be pampered a bit after walking the city for the day. It was complimentary, and we used it almost every evening. Espresso in the room was fantastic, as were the toiletries. Bedding was heavenly and definitely a western style (beds were soft and plush - which I love, best sleep of our trip!!). If you're not into that, they had a pillow menu that might help you find something firmer. I can't say enough about the room and the service. They took care of our kids with toys, gifts, and welcome amenities. An amazing family luxury hotel that is personal - I would stay there without question the next time we are in Tokyo.","Portland, Oregon","Socal45</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",30,5.0

My wife and I previously stayed at the hotel for 8 nights in November 2015. This review is based on both visits.This is one of the two or three best hotels I've ever stayed at. The service is flawless-- attentive, thoughtful, kind, and thorough without being obsequious or overbearing. The food -- breakfast in-room for nine days and dinner for three nights (twice in-room and once in the outstanding top-floor restaurant) -- is first-rate. The rooms are tastefully decorated, well thought out, easily navigated, and impeccably clean. The bathrooms, well, they are Four Seasons bathrooms. We especially enjoyed the rooms overlooking Tokyo Station so that we could watch the trains come and go, especially at night (don't worry, it's not noisy). The location is close to many attractions on the east side of the city and convenient to subways and trains to reach other parts of the city. On the last trip, we were upgraded to the two best rooms in the hotel, a real treat, but the standard rooms are fantastic. I'd think that over an 8-day stay, and two stays over a one and a half year period, you'd find a weakness or a mistake -- there weren't any.

The first challenge was finding a hotel in Tokyo which could comfortably put an extra bed in a room with a king bed. The Four Seasons was a among a few hotels (mostly luxury hotels) which could do so. But more importantly, the Four Seasons has a number of rooms which have an amazing view of Tokyo Station (particularly the Shinkansen trains heading west from Tokyo Station), and since my son _loves_ Japanese trains, it seemed like the perfect pick. We used the Amex Platinum Card ""Fine Hotels and Resorts"" travel benefit to get a reasonably priced room with breakfast included for two, a complimentary fourth night, a $100 credit from the spa, and a potential room upgrade. (Note that we received an upgrade, when it became available, from a Deluxe room to a One-Bedroom Suite.)Prior to arrival, to confirm our reserved room had the best view of the trains, I contacted the Four Seasons Marunouchi local reservations email, and they were extremely helpful in working with me to find the very best available room. And they did an extraordinary job. We literally looked right out onto the trains (without any noise concerns)--my son was able to watch the trains from his bed (we're convinced he wouldn't have slept if we hadn't lowered the mechanical blackout shades). He could even see all of the trains lined up at the station (which you can't do from the other nearby hotels that are on higher floors)... and every morning, they saved us the table at breakfast where he could eat and watch the trains. My son was in heaven, and it was as if we had a silent babysitter (JR) with us.If trains aren't your thing, this hotel is perfectly situated--close to lots of great areas, and a short walk to almost every subway and train line (not just Tokyo station, but the surrounding stations as well) you could need. But the real reason to stay here, in our view, is the talented, dedicated, and loving staff. It is a smaller hotel than most of the luxury hotels in Tokyo, and they shower guests with extra attention as a result. Because they knew our son loved trains, when we arrived, each staff member we ran into had something train-themed to give him. There was a cookie with his name on it waiting for him in the hotel room, a step stool for the bathroom sink, bath toys, a kids robe and slippers, and even a little booklet with his name on it that he could use to record his fun experiences in Tokyo (along with a way for him to write a note to the hotel manager). We all felt like we were extremely well cared for, but he felt like he was home--and as parents who were still anxious about taking a 4.5-year-old on his first trip outside of North America, we cannot possibly thank the staff (Mari, Mami, Ricky, Kasumi, Soon, Fumiya, etc.) at the Four Seasons enough, which is at least part of the reason we are writing this review--something we do not ordinarily do.The breakfast is perfect, with eggs, cereals, yogurt, fresh juices, bacon, different kinds of sausage, mushrooms, vegetables, salad, fresh baked goods, various kinds of toast, tea (including several very nice herbal teas), fresh fruit and berries etc. And if you're in the mood for something divine, order the pancakes or french toast--it's not obvious if you order the buffet, but if you ask, they'll bring you those special treats! We hope this review helps other families with young children have just as great an experience in Tokyo as we did.","Newton, Massachusetts","ethanbernstein</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newton, Massachusetts</strong>",5,5.0

Private tour guide recommended by hotel, Ms. Hiragi, was a 5-star tour guide! The room is relatively big, clean, and definitely better than the 4* hotels weve tried in Japan so far. Despite staying on the 3rd floor facing Tokyo Station, we didnt notice any noise from the main street nor the station. Things That The Hotel Could Improve On:The main lobby is relatively small. Signage is also a bit hidden, and unlike most 5* hotels, Four Seasons didn't have a driveway leading to the main entrance. This makes the hotel look more like an office building (which it is, as it shares the same building as Pacific Century) as opposed to a real 5* hotel at first glance. Breakfast Buffet spread is good, but could use a little more variety. Internet is also a bit choppy, and I constantly had to connect and reconnect. Internet speed ranges from 256kbps-1.2mbps, which is shockingly slow by Japanese standards. Tv channels are also mostly in Japanese; and CNN was playing with two languages simultaneously (a female japanese kept translating whatever the anchor said) so I had to turn the TV off. For a 5* hotel, it could use more channels. And for a family hotel, it had ""0"" channels for kids. Summary:Superb Staff. Big Rooms. Good Location. Small Lobby. Slow Internet. Lack of Channels [ENGLISH]. Breakfast Buffet spread is exactly the same as 4* hotels. ",,Ted V,0,4.0

I far to often find that a repeat visit to a hotel or place of which I have very pleasant memories ends in disappointment. Not so with our second trip to the Four Seasons. Several familiar faces (some with promotions - congratulations Yumi!) greeted us with as much attention and care as the previous year. Nothing was too much trouble for the concierge staff (as previously) and the hotel breakfasts are still some of the best I have ever experienced. The care that was put into making our children feel welcome was, once again, fully on display, with appropriate sized bathrobes and slippers, little treats to eat, as well as a message from the manager addressed to them (they were too nervous to write back to him, I'm afraid!) resulted in the Four Seasons being cemented in the minds of our children as our ""Tokyo Home"".Our room was delightful - a suite with views of Tokyo Station. The main bed was comfortable and the bathroom was well stocked with toiletries - once again with bath toys and novelty sponges for our little ones.The location of this hotel is fantastic, almost on top of Tokyo station, making access to Tokyo's marvellous underground railway for local trips as well as the Shinkansen for day trips or departure a matter of minutes. Once again, we were overcome by the level of service we received on departure, with a member of the concierge staff assisting us to our train and ensuring we were comfortable, even ensuring we could swivel a pair of seats so that we could sit together as a family of four.My wife enjoyed a trip to the spa, but unfortunately experienced a skin reaction to one of the ingredients in the facial treatment. The staff were extremely apologetic. The treatment was immediately refunded and rapid assistance in obtaining appropriate medication was provided. I went to the pharmacy to obtain the medication in question with one of the staff, who insisted that the hotel cover all costs, despite my offers. While unfortunate, this situation was managed in the best manner possible by the hotel staff.My only criticism was that the sofa bed in our suite was not well suited to two children due to its tendency to sag in the middle, causing late night cries of outrage about who was invading whose ""side"". In retrospect, our more humble room with two queen beds the previous year would probably be a more comfortable option with two children, notwithstanding the need for whispered conversations after lights out!.Overall, a wonderful experience again.

We were greeted at the Tokyo Station train platform by two professionals from the Four Seasons Tokyo. I really wish I remembered their names because they both were tremendous helping us with our five heavy suitcases all the way back to the hotel. Check-in was fast, and the staff who greeted us upon arrival were so kind and welcoming. We were escorted to our Premiere room, which was quite spacious. I really liked the clean, minimalistic decor of the rooms, which reminded me of the Toronto FS property. The bed, which I believe was one of the newer Simmons beds offered at some of the FS properties, was comfortable, and my back was happy every morning. Being in the middle of the winter, the room was quite dry, but the humidifier provided some relief.We had booked the room many months prior to our stay in January. One of the biggest attractions Tokyo had to offer was the world class cuisine. We were well aware that competition for seatings was fierce and that reservations most often will only given to individual who spoke Japanese. Akhil and his colleagues (Miki, Xing, and Misato) with concierge were absolutely amazing from the get go. We were lucky enough to be secured a seating for lunch at Jiro's restaurant in Ginza, as well as other top choices of ours. That experience alone made the trip to Tokyo worthwhile!We only ate breakfast and mid afternoon snacks at the on-site restaurant, Motif. I loved both the breakfast buffet and Japanese style breakfast (make sure you have a big appetite). I'm a huge fan of fresh juice and Motif's juices were amazing. Service, again, was top notch, and the gentleman who took care of us at the restaurant, Ricky, was a really great personable guy. The Four Seasons Tokyo is quite different than the majority of their other properties. With 56 rooms or so, I believe it's the smallest hotel in their network, which gave it a ""boutique"" hotel type of feel. The lobby is small with minimal seating areas. Thus, if you're the type who loves to lounge around in the lobby, this may not be the ideal hotel for you. The service and overall experience, however, was the best I've experienced at a Four Seasons property. Kishi-sama does an exceptional job taking care and managing the property. Thank you, Kishi and the rest of the Four Seasons staff, for making our first trip to Tokyo a memorable one.

The welcome and sending off service at the train station is wonderful and makes you feel really special. It s like having a private butler service right in the middle of Tokyo. I guess the small number of rooms, 50+, allows them to provide this unique service. But on top of this, every staff we ve come across was smiling and made you feel like you were a special guest. We stayed with our 16 months toddler and not only was the baby crib provided but the whole room was secured with sharp corners of every furniture covered with a foamy protection. The level of detail in service and attention was just unparalled.As for the room, it was of a very good size especially considering the fact it is right above the Tokyo station. We had a room facing the tracks and even though you could hear the trains it didnt feel like a major disturbance especially as the view was just wonderful with a great view of the different Shinkansens and also the Yamanote line trains so symbolic of Tokyo. We spent a great amount of time watching the trains coming and leaving and felt so lucky for that view.Bathrooom was great with great amenities, with only a few points to point out if being picky, which were the lack of rain shower and the fact the washlet was not so advanced compared to what is now the norm in Japan but overall it was just great. The bed was super comfy and was just perfect after a whole day roaming the city. Locationwise, it is right above Tokyo station with its pros and cons. Pros being the easy access to all the trains, the closeness to Ginza, the imperial grounds or Nihonbashi and the underground mall with the famous Ramen street a short walk away. Cons being the fact you are in the middle of a constant hustle that comes with being in Tokyo station and which can become kind of stressful at times. We also used the Spa which was also of a great level and actually very reasonable in terms of price compared to spas of hotels of the same category in Tokyo. Some other reviews mentioned the very small size of the lobby and reception desk which is true. When we first arrived we were suprised at the reception desk but felt that it gave a more personal feel which i think is the keyword of this hotel. This hotel is more about providing a personal and exclusive service rather than being grand or with made to impress designs. Pricewise we felt that though it was on a higher range it was somehow reasonable considering the price range of average hotels in the same vicinity.  Overall it was just a great stay and we would definitely go back. There are some downfalls in terms of location if you dislike the hustle of Tokyo station or if your business is mostly in the Western part of town but the level of service is just so high that it makes up for all the downfalls. If you have the budget or can stretch it a bit, do not hesitate, this hotel is definitely worth it.",Paris,"FERU06</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris</strong>",68,5.0

Very difficult to give an overall rating for my view on this property is mixed ! Let's talk about the good:1. The service level is beyond comparison. Example number 1, a staff from concierge escorted me to the Shinkansen platform at the Tokyo Station - this made the 4 minutes walk from the hotel to Tokyo station with a roller luggage in tow so pleasant and stylish, this also saved me the hassle from trying to figure out where the platform for my train was. Talking about travel in style ! Example number 2, the first night during my stay, I asked for firmer pillows, yet the pillows housekeeping could offer me was not firm enough for me, and so I settled with their Japanese buckwheat pillows and I was happy with them. The next day when I returned to my room, the housekeeping had curated a set of firmer pillows for me without me ask them to. This showed how the hotel care about whether their guests can get a good rest and took initiatives to try to help, this really impressed me and was really above and beyond my expecatations.2. The Location: Very conveniently located. On top of being near Ginza and next to Tokyo statio, there are 3 big high-end shopping malls nearby with full range of restaurants, convenient stores, and supermarket ! 3. Room is spacious - I stayed at a city view king bed room, even with a rolled away bed added, the room did not feel cramped at all - very spacious room in Tokyo's standard ! Now the not so good part: This is a small property with an inconspicuous entrance, and a very small lobby with the reception desk tuck behind a huge pillar at an awkward angle - the reception desk in my apartment at home is better than this ! I mean this is Four Seasons hotel - I expect something better, with more design, better quality and more style - their lobby is no better than a 2 star business hotel ! Breakfast: The hotel's breakfast offering not only was very underwhelming and was way too pricy. A very basic continental breakfast was about US$ 45 dollars, and if you accidentally ordered an egg, than you will have to pay more than US$50 dollars ! I usually does not complaint about hotel food price, however, the offering was so sub-par, let's say, even if it was for free, I would not touch it - such a shame ! I am very torn in giving 3 stars to this property, but I think Four seasons Marunouchi at this price point has let me down - and I want to let reviewers know what they are getting when choosing a hotel in Tokyo - There are a lot more better offers out there !

This review will be mainly geared toward families. This was my second stay here, please refer to that review from Feb 2016 for more on a non-family visit. Traveling with the kids, I felt that we would be more comfortable at the FS, rather than a couple other luxury hotels in the Marunouchi area which are more ostentatiously decorated or have such minimalist decor that they make me feel like I'm in a museum and have to whisper. The kids were able to be themselves here.Location: For families, FS Marunouchi's ideal location is walking distance to the Imperial Palace, bright lights of Ginza shopping district and Nihonbashi. Tokyo Station, with tons of shopping and dining choices, not to mention easy access to subways to take you anywhere in Tokyo and shinkansen for farther excursions, is next door and there is a convenient interior elevator access which is especially nice during cold and rainy weather. The hotel has several complimentary bicycles for guest use (including sizes for both kids and adults). We rode to the palace and shopping streets of Marunouchi and the kids really enjoyed dodging people on the sidewalks. Hotel Service/Amenities:Staff are very accommodating to families and we were welcomed back each day with special treats for the kids and adults in our room. Dining options in their restaurant and in-room dining range from typical kid menu items, to special kid-sized Japanese breakfasts and anything can be customized to your tastes. There is no pool and kids aren't allowed in the small spa, but there is so much to do in Tokyo that they didn't miss it. Concierges are very helpful and were able to get tickets for several activities prearranged before our arrival. We took the Narita Express N'EX train from Narita to Tokyo Station and we love love love the Tokyo Station train platform greeting and departing service. Rooms: Our corner suite looked over the shinkansen lines of Tokyo Station. Housekeeping set up the sofa bed and a rollaway for our kids who decided sharing a queen sofa bed wasn't an acceptable bedding arrangement. Kid robes and house slippers were already in the room and mom and dad enjoyed the hotel provided pajamas.

We called from the airport and gave the hotel the time we would be arriving at the Tokyo Station. 2 staff members were at the station to take charge of our luggage and escort us to the hotel. We had taken a dinner package which included a gourmet multi course dinner at Motif, which was wonderful. Enjoyed their bar with engaging bar tenders. The next day their staff again escorted us to the Tokyo Station to get our JR pass activated and drop us at our train for you day trip to Hakone. This is a great location if one is planning to do day trips on the Shinkansen. Loved the location of our room overlooking the zipping bullet trains. The spa is included in the hotel room rate. Nice to use the onsen in the evening after a hectic day sigh seeing. Many hotels charge extra for spa usage in Tokyo (The Prince Gallery charges appox. $45 per person per day). This hotel is relatively low key. If one is looking for lot of action I would recommend the Mandarin Oriental or Park Hyatt.","Boston, Massachusetts","artistworldtraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",22,5.0

Pre-arrival concierge was spot on; we wanted romance train tickets in the front observation car, which is almost impossible to get from outside the country. Not only did their concierge go to Shinjuku station across town to get the tickets, they were honest with us and didn't charge us for the running fee because they said their person doing the errand had other reasons to be there. Compare that to the Park Hyatt hotel concierge who said he had no way to get those special tickets. The hotel provided good recommendations for things to do in Tokyo with kids; we wound up having a lot more fun with our kids in Tokyo than anticipated. Concierge also arranged an excellent city guide that worked well with our kids. The hotel rooms are oversized; our two connecting rooms felt like an apartment and the gifts provided to the kids on arrival were really nice (ie: cookies with their names on them and stuffed animals). I had been concerned that there would be no views but the rooms and common areas were bright and this was really not a problem (we also stayed at the Park Hyatt which had great views but which also had its downsides). We also liked the decor and wall art which was sensible and very tasteful. Breakfast buffet and things that came from the kitchen were excellent; anything we asked for we got without any nickel and diming. One evening we came to the hotel at 9pm after failing at the Imperial Hotel to find food we and our kids wanted to eat despite their dozen restaurants, and the restaurant staff were most accommodating and made up whatever we wanted, which is one of the most important reasons why I chose this hotel in the first place. The hotel has a very good gym and a beautiful sauna area, which feels like a private area and for which they don't charge extra, unlike the Park Hyatt which wanted $40 a day extra to use the sauna and which was pretty crowded. Privacy also is helpful in Japan which is totally nude in sauna areas. Spa treatment was also excellent. We really enjoyed the meet and greet service at the train upon arrival and the assistance getting us and our luggage back to the train upon departure. Tokyo station is particularly intimidating to a foreigner who has just arrived for the first time; it is huge and confusing with many entrances and levels until someone shows you the ropes. The assistant helped us get our train tickets to Kyoto at the station, took us to the track and helped us around the station get food to take on the train. People here don't expect to be tipped which makes all this service even extra special, because people are actually providing service to provide service. The concierge got us a table at Kyubey ( a top sushi place) on half an hour's notice. English was not a problem in terms of communicating with the staff; this is important because at other hotels such as the Park Hyatt we had problems communicating with most of the staff and getting simple things done such as making a collect call to the US. If you came to the lobby at 4am with jetlag and wanted something to eat, people were nice to you and gave you something. At the Park Hyatt, they simply kicked you out of the breakfast area. This hotel is easy to get in and out of; the Hyatt is on top floors of a skyscraper so you have to go up and down to get in and out and the hotel is a taxi ride from the train station; here you can walk to a major station. I also liked this part of the city better than Shinjuku; less chaotic and no matter where you stay you have to take a taxi to get anywhere so you might as well be here. You can get to Shinjuku from Tokyo station in 15 minutes with an express train or in a taxi at off hours. The Park Hyatt has more food options and a bigger gym and a pool; but all of these (except for lack of a pool) are perfectly adequate here and overall this is a much better property in terms of service and accommodation and it is all the more impressive considering the rates we paid at both properties. Here we felt like guests of a residence rather than tourists in a large hotel. When we returned to the hotel after an activity, the staff knew where we had been and asked us how we liked what we did. It is just no contest. This is a perfect place for a visitor to use as a base for Tokyo with or without families.","New York City, New York","649ic</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",646,5.0

An example of the latter - we needed to reserve a half-dozen different train tickets off of our JR pass. The bellman ""Mike"" walked us to the station, and he made sure the ticket agent knew exactly what we needed, even securing us the 'Mount Fuji View"" side of the train. He then bought a local ticket so that he could walk us to the platform to make sure we got on the right train! All of their restaurant recommendations worked out wonderfully as well.Don't be put off by the location being next to the station - it's actually an excellent neighborhood (right next to Ginza) with a ton of restaurants and shops. Moreover, the train station proximity makes it perfect for day tripping, and the ""Hato"" tour bus pickup is a block away. Helpful tip #1: Tokyo Station is a huge maze, and you arrive from the airport in the sub-sub-sub basement. You're looking for the ""Yaesu South"" exit (you'll see Yaesu Center first - follow that until you see Yaesu South). Go out that exit and take a right.

Your whole visit is pampered and luxurious, from the exquisite Japanese sweets in your room everyday to having someone meet you on the train platform to escort you to the hotel (Even if you've been to Tokyo before, the train station is enormous and the signs to the correct exit are confusing).We selected the hotel for its location next to Tokyo station not only for the convenience of taking the Shinkansen but also for shopping and restaurants. Character Street in the station itself is a fun place for kids to look around and is classic kawaii culture. Nearby are the Marunouchi and Ginza shopping areas - the latter is more Western luxury retailers while the former has more Japanese brands. We also ate in the restaurants at the top of Daimaru department store or grabbed a bento dinner in the food hall (just like the locals on their way home) if the kids were too tired to go out. We had an Executive suite with a connecting king bedded room for our family. My kids are too old now to want to share even a large bed, and it would have been nice if they offered double beds in the connecting room (we were aware of this at the time of booking). This is one aspect of the Four Seasons chain I've noticed at even the resort properties. Although they have wonderful amenities for (younger) kids, the bed configuration is always less than ideal. For that price and paying for a second room each kid should get a real bed, not a rollaway. Unlike some of Tokyo's luxury hotels, this is in a low rise building. The Four Seasons type of traveler may be bothered by the noise of the trains going by, but this wasn't a problem for us.

While clean, comfortable and understatedly luxurious, the hard product isn't the most cutting edge in Tokyo. But having said that, the soft product, i.e. the service, is faultless. Where do I begin? I did some shopping on Amazon Japan before I arrived, and one of the whiskies that I ordered came in a box with the drawing of a wine bottle printed on it. The hotel saw that, and proactively emailed to ask if I would like to have it stored in the hotel's wine chiller. As others have reported, guests are addressed by name. How they manage to remember all the guests, I really have no idea. The breakfast buffet offers a decent spread of hot and cold food, but only small quantities -- refreshed frequently -- are displayed at any one time, so that the food remains fresh and the presentation doesn't appear too ""mass"". After I checked out, I stood outside while my colleague went to retrieve the car from the car park (the ticket was misplaced so it took quite long) and the concierge, an older Japanese gentleman, came out to the driveway after 15 mins to check if everything was alright.

It's also just a short walk to the Ginza district.The rooms are spacious and well appointed, just as you would expect from the Four Seasons. Bathrooms were modern, complete with a Japanese electric toilet/bidet. It's a different experience if you're an American, but hard to go back once you've tried it.For us, service was top notch. One thing this hotel does which we really appreciated was they will escort you from your train to the hotel when you arrive in town. Likewise, they will take you to your train when you leave. Tokyo Station is absolutely huge and can be very hard to navigate, so this was one less thing to worry about. They will also help you send your bags on ahead if you're on a multi-city vacation (you still pay for the delivery). Apparently, no one in Japan travels with their luggage on the trains, and we could see why. There literally isn't enough time to futz around with your bags in the short amount of time the trains stop at a platform.Restaurant at the top of the hotel was very good. Again, service was great. We stayed at the hotel for the 1st 3 days of our trip, and then again on the last day a week later. They still remembered our preferences (and our names) when we got back.Spa was pretty great.

As a result there is not the same array of services that can be found at much larger hotels (e.g. pool, multiple restaurants, grand lobby). However, the location (next to Tokyo Station) is excellent for exploring the city via the metro or JR lines or for travelling outside of Tokyo via the Shinkansen (bullet train). The hotel is probably most obviously designed for business people, however it is also very welcoming to children and has a range of excellent room configurations for families, which can be difficult to accomodate in Tokyo. The hotel has strollers available, but the restaurant is limited to those 12 years old and above - so eating out is recommended.The rooms are very well appointed and generously sized, especially by big city standards. But As ever with Four Seasons, the best aspect of the hotel is the service. It is impeccable. All of the staff were extremely friendly and accomodating. In particular the chief concierge (Akhil) and one of the deputy concierges (Shoko) are a tremendous credit to the hotel and will go out of their way to assist.One small area for improvement is the free wifi, which is limited to 2 devices per room. That is fine for someone travelling alone on business, but if there's more than one person in the room, up to 5 devices really need to be allowed for the free wifi to be meaningful.",,B4111MZC,11,5.0

We chose the hotel for its room size (they were one of a few to allow 3 single beds in the interconnecting room) and its proximity to Tokyo Station. It was also our first ski trip to Japan as we had plans to travel from Tokyo to Hakuba by bullet train. And all this during the busy Japan New Year period (we were travelling to and from Hakuba in late Dec 2015 to early January)!We knew that we would find language and cultural barriers, and that we would need help to get us seamlessly from city to ski fields without getting lost at one of the world's busiest train stations. The concierge consistently met our expectations, from accompanying us to pre-purchase the shinkansen tickets, to waiting with us on the departing platform, to sending our ski gear in advance by courier to our Hakuba accommodation.During our 5 nights' stay at the Four Seasons, we enjoyed a delightful degustation dinner on Christmas day, and their elegant buffet breakfast every morning. Their staff also helped us book a sensational tempura degustation style lunch at tenichi in the Sony building in nearby Ginza. We got tips for travelling to the Maraikan museum to see the Asimo robot demonstration, for taking a walk to the Fish markets, and for shopping in the Ginza and Shinjuku area. There were hotel bikes available to ride to the Imperial Gardens but we chose to get there by foot and encountered many locals jogging around the Gardens on a sunny winter day. The late opening hours of the Four Seasons day spa meant that the helpful staff there could accommodate mums who wish to enjoy a relaxing massage after putting the kids to bed!The Four Seasons staff helped to make our first trip to Tokyo a success and we now have the confidence to return to Japan for another ski trip.","Sydney, Australia","famof5hols</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",10,5.0

Our children were thrilled with treats and small gifts from the staff. Concierge was wonderful in arranging last-minute dinner reservations, called the place ahead to let them know we were coming and provided us with a map and directions on how to get there. We were greeted by the staff at the train platform upon arrival, and helped with Shinkansen ticket purchase and send-off upon check-out.

The location is great for both business and tourism. The Narita Express train brings you directly from the airport to Tokyo station, right next to the hotel. The Shinkansen and other trains to outlying areas originate there as well. And local subways are very close, too. The hotel is an easy walk to the Imperial Palace grounds, with their beautiful (and public) East Garden. The hotel staff provide absolutely exemplary service, and my husband tells me they have done so consistently during every one of his stays. As a non-Japanese speaking first time visitor to Japan, I relied much more heavily on the concierge, doormen, and other hotel staff than I normally do when I travel. They arranged a tour guide for a couple of days at my request, asked for feedback on the (excellent) guide, gave me clear and helpful instructions for days I went sightseeing on my own, made restaurant reservations, hailed cabs and gave directions in Japanese to the drivers (since cab drivers as a rule don't speak English), and always made sure when I went out that I had a card with the hotel name and location written in Japanese to give to cabbies if needed to get back. When we left on the Shinkansen, a hotel staff member even helped us walk our bags to the station and buy a ticket.I ate breakfast most mornings at the hotel restaurant, and have to say how very good it was. I don't usually care for other hotel's breakfast buffets because the food is often not terribly good or fresh. But the buffet here was completely different. Really fresh, really good, great variety, and the staff were very gracious. Love the hot croissants! And a colleague on the same trip reports that items ordered off the menu are equally good, especially the French toast.Even the housekeeper who covered our room did an impressive job. He was English-speaking, unobtrusively took care of the room around our unpredictable jet-lagged sleep schedule, and kept things absolutely spotless and orderly.The management and staff of this hotel should give lessons at other hotels.

I love absolutely EVERYTHING about it! (Except the price, but I still bite the bullet and indulge... 3 times, and counting...) We have always been Four Seasons fans. Have stayed in Four Seasons Hampshire(UK), Merrakech, Hong Kong, etc.. All had wonderful experience. When we decided to take my daughter(3 yo at that time) to Tokyo(Disneyland) for the first time in June 2014, we stayed in Four Seasons Marunouchi for 4 nights. Everything was perfect. So when we planned a family reunion trip to celebrate my father-in-law's birthday in Tokyo in June 2015, we decided to stay there again. This time with 6 adults and 3 kids stayed in 3 rooms. Our family members fly to Tokyo from 3 different countries(different arrival times). Lots of logistic needs to figure out : 3 young kids are all in different age and have different needs. They asked our needs before we arrived and prepared everything in each room perfectly. I called it a ""Four Seasons moment"". (Most Four Seasons I stayed, I experienced different and wonderful Four Seasons moments.) This stay, I forgot to bring my 4 yo daughter's shampoo and lotion. I recalled they provided a very good toiletries at previous stay. So I asked if they can provide kids amenity kit. At first, they wasn't sure what I need. But very soon, there were 5 hotel staff appeared at my door with hands full of any kids amenity I could possibly think of: baby bath tub, step stool, towels, bath toy, sponge, dipper disposal bin, toiletries, etc.. for me to choose from. They wanted to make sure I got everything I need. Isn't that a great service? The reason drove me to write this review even it was few months ago is that recently we stayed in another 5-star hotel( I admit it was the price factor to drive me tried another brand) in Hibiya/Yurakucho area, we found ourselves missed Four Seasons every minute. We couldn't help comparing everything to Four Seasons's gold standard. We realised that once we stayed here, it is very difficult to stay anywhere else.

The best metaphor for FS Tokyo would be a Bonsai tree. It is small in size, but every detail is precise and deliberate. And most of all, it is aesthetically pleasing!We split our stay at FS Tokyo into two segments: 2 nights at the start of our Japan excursion AND five nights afterward. Over the course of the stay, we got to know the team quite well. The two individuals that stood out most for us were Mr. Kishi (Hotel Manager) and Ms. Kumoda (Guest Relations Manager). Both have exceeded our expectations by going above and beyond in ensuring FS Tokyo was our home in Japan! We started to email Mr. Kishi to customize a package for over two months. And thanks to his leadership, we experienced the best FS location! With Ms. Kumoda, we considered her our guardian angel at the hotel. You do not notice her, but you are always aware of her smiling presence. In one instance, I mentioned that I wanted some latkas instead of hash browns for breakfast, not thinking too much of it...but guess what I had the next day for breakfast….LATKAS! Turns out, she googled the recipe, past it to the kitchen and asked them to have it ready for me. Other concrete examples that the FS Tokyo team had exceeded our expectations are as follows:***Concierge Team***They gave us great tips in getting the much prized vests at the Tsukiji Market to see the tuna auction. They were also our personal “trip-advisors” for things to do, places to eat, and where to shop. All their recommendations have exceeded our expectations!***Front Desk Team***Despite being well seasoned travellers, we were overwhelmed by the subways and underground shopping paths. Thankfully, we were able to rely on the front desk team to: 1). Escorted us all the way to the counter that rented us the mobile wifi (must have for all visitors! and was highly recommended by the concierge team). And on route back to the hotel, she took us to the subway station to get me a subway card and assisted with loading it with some money (I was grateful as that machine was only in Japanese)2). Escorted us to exchange our JR pass to actual tickets, and took the initiative to assist / help us to book our tickets to Kyoto and Hiroshima. And to ensure we don’t get lost or missed our train, he showed us to the platform and waited until the train arrive. Helped us with our luggages and waved goodbye from the platform as our train was leaving. ***Spa****By the end of the excursion I was in need of a pick-me-up. I took advantage of their Annivesary Total care facial and body treatment. It was, by far, one of THE best facial and body treatment I have ever gotten. As a testiment, I was literally glowing for days! ***F&B Team***Due to dietary restriction, the F&B team was quite watchful of the requirements. But in one occasion during the breakfast buffet, where I took some food that I thought it was safe...when I arrived back to my table, one of the team member apologized for the interruption and told me that the kitchen had modified the recipe and as such, it was unsafe for me to eat it. He assured me that he already informed the kitchen to prepare a dish that will meet my dietary needs.  Conclusion. FS Tokyo is a city hotel. It is small in size. It does not have a swimming pool. But they have won the hearts of two well travelled and particular people! A job well done FS Tokyo. Planning an excuse to see the team again soon.",,Victor L,38,5.0

It was more expensive than what we normally outlay but on many levels it was well worth the extra money The location was excellent as it is beside the mammoth Tokyo Railway station thus providing easy access to any of the many areas of the huge city and we could also walk to the Imoerial Palace and its gardens as well as the Ginza. The hotel overall has an understated but luxurious and intimate atmosphere. Our room was very spacious with every thing necessary for comfort and enjoyment. Good design and top quality was the standard and it was scrupulously clean. We had a terrific view including of the bullet trains coming and going and it gave a great sense of being in an exciting city but it was quiet and serene. We ate a buffet breakfast every morning, again with a fantastic view, At first we thought it a tad pricey but found it such good quality food and service that we returned every day and we found it satisfied us for most of the day. The thing that really impressed us the most though was the care and attention we received from the staff. Without exception they were warm, friendly, personable and willing to go to great trouble to make our stay a pleasant experience. Someone accompanied us to purchase our ticket for our on journey to Kyoto and on our departure took us to catch our bullet train. They said they would meet us on our return and accompany us through the enormous Tokyo Station to our train to Hakone even though we were not returning to the Four Seasons Hotel. When we did not appear on the train (we had inadvertently booked tickets for the wrong day)they followed up to see what had happened, contacted us and then met us the following day.

The location right by the Tokyo station is impeccable. I was worried that it'd be noisy from street traffic, which is constant arounnd this part, but the rooms are surprisingly quiet. I suspect it's partly because of the new Pacific Century Plaza building, even the ventilation system that plagues most hotels is dead quiet. The hotel is minimalist in style and tastefully done. Love the room, not sure if the ""deluxe king room"" is any different, and there's definitely enough for the two of us to stretch the legs after ""Ginbura"" (a walk through Ginza). Young and friendly English-speaking front desk staff & concierge - better to take advice they offer, esp. when it comes to what to eat. We went to Tsukiji market before 3AM local time, and they helped us catch a cab. Lots of little things require attention for vacation travellers like us - for example, how to catch the Shinkansen to Kyoto - the Tokyo Station is highly disorienting esp. during rush hour; having the hotel staff walk us through till we boarded the train was one of the most reassuring experience we had during this visit. Also very helpful is having the concierge call the restaurants to make reservation. The more exclusive restaurants (esp. Sukiyabashi Jiro) requires advance booking the month before your dinner date. All in all Tokyo has so much to offer to different types of travellers. This Four Seasons is a small boutique hotel (not a resort) that offers Four Seasons comfort without fail (reminds me of Fairmont Gold, other Four Seasons hotels). For first time travellers from N. America to Tokyo via Narita Airport, esp. if you arrive during your normal sleeping time but rush hour in Japan, use the hotel's airport pick up service. It would save a lot of aggravation if you want to go by the Narita Express to the Tokyo station.

Was very excited when I finally booked it in.Overall - was incredibly disappointed with the stay and definitely wouldn't recommend anyone going back until the property is properly completely renovated.The property lacked the grandeur of a Four Seasons - the lobby was tiny and understaffed. I arrived late in the evening (11pm) and there was two staff manning the entire lobby and had to wheel in my luggage myself.The rooms were very dated and small in comparison to the price. The corridor leading into my room was narrow and claustrophobic, the curtain looked more like a wrinkly blanket, and worst of all, the bathroom was full of MOLD (unbelievable until you see the attached pictures!). Room amenities were lacking compared to other hotels in Japan - TV was very small, internet was 1000+JPY a day, iron was outdated, only an electric kettle for coffee and the temperature/fan controls were old school analog dials!The location was right in the heart of Tokyo (right above Tokyo Station), but unfortunately on the 'wrong' side of Tokyo Station (esp. from the Narita Express). To get to the hotel, you actually have to cut all the way through the station, through another building, walk outside and then into the Four Seasons. Because of the close proximity to the train station, right outside my window was the rail tracks - you'll hear train noises late into the night, and right early in the morning. To make matters worse, when the trains stopped, maintenance works came out to perform noisy repairs on the tracks (see pictures).The staff was uninspired and understaffed. Many times returning at night, the only staff in the lobby had his/her head buried in the computer and didn't bother to greet the returning guests. Cleaning was definitely an issue (given the mold all over the bathroom). But all throughout the property, you could tell that the management of the property lacked the attention to detail you'd expect from a Four Seasons. For example, the shower only had Shampoo and Conditioner - no shower gel! The shower gel was placed beside the bath tub and no one had thought that perhaps someone would want to use shower gel in the shower.There were also numerous little things wrong with the property, and simply not enough reason to return. It's a shame as the hotel standards in Tokyo are always sky high and you'd expect the Four Seasons to put in much better effort than this.","Santa Clara, California","JamieTravelsWell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Clara, California</strong>",30,1.0

A quick and painless change at Shimbashi (no dragging luggage up stairs) equals a journey at around 30-35 minutes. You take the Yaesu South Exit and turn right to walk 1-2 minutes to the hotel entrance, past a McDonald's and some coin lockers. Upon arriving at Tokyo Station, you might see some stairs but there is always a ramp as well, try looking for this if you are travelling with heavy luggage. From Narita, there is a limousine bus that drops you off at Tokyo Station bus stop 7, which is a short 1 minute stroll from the hotel.Staff, overall, was very polite. They sent around some Halloween cookies to all the rooms on Oct. 31 which was a nice touch. Communication with the hotel was prompt and efficient. The concierge also helped us make a few dinner reservations prior to our arrival. Just one hiccup - I was returning to the hotel after lunch and was stopped at the hotel entrance with an unfriendly look and a ""How can I help you?"". Perhaps she didn't believe that I was staying there. However, this was a one-off incident and I must commend the other staff at the reception and the gym for being very kind and welcoming.The room is not sound proof and we unfortunately were assigned to a room at the back, facing the train tracks. Earplugs, however, solved this problem very effectively. I would like to warmly thank one of the housekeeping staff who went to a lot of trouble to ensure that I had pillows with the right ""firmness"". Gym is small but well equipped. Shower facilities were excellent and welcome after a workout.We had breakfast once in the restaurant and was quite happy with it. Didn't opt for the buffet as we like a light start and loved the different types of homemade marmalade that came with our continental breakfast. Am a little surprised with the limited buffet offering.I personally disliked the small and cramped lobby as it gave it more of an soulless office feel but I suppose you don't spend much time there. I have stayed in the Four Seasons San Francisco and Macau and found this branch to be a little lacking in terms of atmosphere. Overall though, the location is very convenient for public transport and airport transfers.","Perth, Australia","ibaxxie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",66,3.0

Here at FS Tokyo all ceiling lights are controlled by just ONE button, and the curtains and drapes are all electronically controlled-with all these controls handily located at the side panel of the bedside table without having need to completely stretch my arm? There’s also a night light in the bathroom, a light that is at the dimmest lux but serve the purpose in a completely black-out room.All these ‘taken for granted’ requirement indeed in realty many hotel chain would not want to spend money to deliver the service to ensure their prices be competitive in the market. Four Seasons is not one of them. They give traveller quality and services and that explains why it comes in a price. (They still even insist to employ cleaners to do the cleaning of the hotel’s external window)Four Seasons brand also makes it an advantage for them to recruit better people from the industry (in every country as well). All the staffs I’d had met here they all speak fluent English (have he/she be a local that speaks fluent English or is a foreign staff speaks fluent English and Japanese) and are ‘sensible' smart people. This is especially important that when unlucky things happened, for example, my wife lost her passport, I didn’t have to repeatedly explaining the story. They can start right away to call the shops that I’d visited and do the talking. When the staffs knew we finally tracked down my wife lost passport (it'd been sent to a local Police station by a good Samaritan), they’re cheered out in happiness.Although FS Tokyo at Marunouchi is small with only less than 60 guest rooms and just one F&B outlet, it's superb location, their attention of details, gourmet food quality and excellent happy staffs (if they’re not happy, how could they make us happy?) make it impeccable and impressive.The only thing I could comment is the hotel smoking policy at their bar area (though it’s really the Government to be blamed for not imposing stringent indoor non-smoking policy), of which the bar locates just outside the non-smoking restaurant, Motif. But the area where smoking is allowed is close to the lift lobby so you could imagine how ‘stuffy’ would that be.But it shouldn’t be that difficult for the management to turn the FS Tokyo into a smoke-free hotel since there is already another luxurious hotel Tokyo Andaz is completely smoke free. I’m very look forward the next time I visit Tokyo FS I can enjoy the night view at the bar with a cold Asahi or Kirin.","Hong Kong, China","A C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",70,5.0

This was obviously an incredibly traumatic and frightening time for us but the staff rose to the task, acting as our ""Tokyo family"". They ensured that my wife received the best medical care that she could, while at the same time assisting enormously with the logistics of reorganising our holiday. Future bookings were seamlessly cancelled, our stay was generously extended and everyday challenges (setting up local telecommunications, assistance finding local long term accommodation) were addressed efficiently and effortlessly.More than just providing wonderful 5 star accommodation in the heart of Tokyo, the hotel was literally our travel agent, real estate agent, IT and logistics support, medical triage service and psychological support.All of this culminated in the delivery of a healthy - if very premature - 2.1kg baby boy.All of the staff were wonderful from the front door on arrival to the staff at MOTIF on the top floor: the personalised concierge services were simply the best that I have ever experienced; the front desk staff were calm, composed and efficient. Bell boys personally walked me the 15 minutes to the local SIM card store to pick up our SIM cards concerned we would get lost in Tokyo station.The greatest thanks however must go to Emi, the guest relations manager, who must be the most singularly impressive hotel employee that I have ever met. Despite the fact that her shift had already finished on the night that my wife went into labour, she accompanied us at 3am to the local hospital to ensure that everything went smoothly. Despite the fact that she was helping us enormously, we repeatedly asked her to go home concerned that she had not slept for so long! However her sense of responsibility was so strong that she declined to leave until she felt the job was done, even to the point of accompanying us in the ambulance to a larger hospital. Finally - confident that we were in good hands - she went home at 8am, although prior to going home she organised a generous breakfast for me in my room. She has since visited us in the hospital on several occasions to ensure that she is going OK, she has brought flowers to her and has even provided advice about where to get baby clothes!This level of service really goes beyond anything that we have experienced or even heard of. I say that the staff was like a family this week, but I am not sure my family would be so helpful and so efficient!In a world where personalised service is frequently espoused but rarely delivered, our stay at the Four Seasons in Tokyo was a revelation. It transformed what could have been one of the most difficult weeks of our lives into something that we could manage. Our experience at the hotel redefines ""hospitality"" and has spoiled us for all future travels.

We had interconencting rooms - our first stay was 7 days - the second was 3 days. The hotel itself - as others have mentioned is quite small and located on low floors. The top floor (F7) featured Restaurant / Bar / Fitness / Spa areas. After spending a month in Japan, I would say that the staff are by far the most well trained we have experienced in Japan. Everyone understands and speaks (some) english. Everyone is of course inspired by the Four Seasons service DNA - so that is always a joy. While the people at the hotel were certainly top notch, the hardware (facilities) were a bit dated in some areas. The rooms are huge for Tokyo standards, but the age shows, especially on the light wood tables, drawers, desks, etc, all look worn. The bathroom is the main attraction of the room, albeit with an odd design, it works very well. For some reason the bathroom doors do not lock. Food quality was excellent. Room service and associated services such as laundry was on par with the property. We did experience minor issues, but they were fixed in a timely manner - which is of course an important parameter. We also had a minor issue with wiring funds to the hotel - this is apparently not something they are used to. It took about 25 emails before we figured out that the hotel had sent us incorrect wire information with typos in them, which delayed payment by two weeks. This of course in turn resulted back and forth communication with banks, finance dept, etc etc. At the end of the day, it worked out. Room cleaning was adequate, we did observe a lot of dust and grime around the window area and metal fittings, but over all it was fine. We travel with FHR. They offered the standard complimentary breakfast which was honored also as room service (with a very relaxed limit) and SPA credit. Upgrades were unavailable during both stays.

It is a very small property, so if you are looking for big and flashy, this is not for you. But if you want discrete and luxurious, this place is great. As others have commented, there is really no lobby. They've wedged the reception desk in a little corner, but it all works. Our room was perfect. We were on a low floor, in the corner, with one wall facing the train tracks (which we requested). 2 entire walls were glass, and the room, especially for Tokyo standards, was quite large. We had two queens and a roll-away, and still felt we had plenty of space. Bathroom was large and well-appointed. We did have some slight train noise at night when we were sleeping and the room was very quiet, but it didn't bother us. Breakfast was very good--nice selection but very high quality, and not overwhelming. The concierge helped us with two dinner reservations. They were not the best picks in the world, but we think that they assumed since we were traveling with younger children that perhaps we wanted casual/fun vs. good/tasty. It was fine though. The spa is very small with just a small onsen and steam room, but it is enough for a short stay. Certainly if they had bigger onsen or a pool, this place would be perfect, but it is Tokyo after all. Service across the board was top notch. We arrived with 2 adult and our 3 children and they were kind enough to accommodate the 3 child even though their stated policy is a max of 4 people/room. We really appreciated their willingness to do this (I would not assume they will do this for you). We tried to borrow movies from the front desk to watch, but somehow we kept picking movies that weren't working, which was a bummer, but they were super apologetic. This property is right next to Tokyo station so a great location for traveling within Tokyo as well as taking day trips. We were able to get to Tsukiji fish market, Akihabara, and Asakusa easily via train/taxi, and also took a nice day trip to Kamakura out of Tokyo station.

We arrived at 10 AM and could not get our room which was fine. We used the Spa facilities to our benefit to shower and clean up. Although the spa is small, it was excellent in their amenities. It had everything you needed. We finally checked in to our deluxe premier queen room which had a great view of the train station. Yaesu did a great job in briefing me what features the room had and if I needed anything else. All my requests such as a firmer bed, extra towels, and even an extra sofa chair in the room was taken care of. The concierge also was impeccable. Akhil, Misato, and Shoko were all great. They took care of all our restaurant reservations. What impressed me the most was that everyday in the morning they knew our itinerary so the map of the restaurant or place we were visiting were all printed out in Japanese with the name and telephone number for the taxis use. The bellboys spoke perfect English and even showed us down to the Tokyo Station shops and restaurants and taught us how to go back to the hotel. Jonathan spoke perfect English. Now the downsides to this hotel was the breakfast and housekeeping. We only ate at the hotel restaurant once in the morning and the buffet spread was of a low quality and the chefs didn't cook a simple omelette correctly. They only offered American items and even their fruit wasn't of a high quality. Japan has the best fruits in the world and their restaurant fruits were sour and not impressive at all. I much rather walk down to the train station and eat my breakfast at the amazing fruit cafe the bellboy's showed us to. the other subpar part was the housekeeping. We would come back to the hotel in the evening and glasses still half filled with water and dirty cutlery wasn't replaced or cleaned. Our clothes weren't folded and the room did not sparkle. I experienced impeccable room service in the four seasons HK so this was not acceptable. Other than this, I would still come back to stay at this hotel for the great location and impeccable service. visiting Japan for the first time can be tricky if you don't have an impeccable concierge team that can help you navigate you through the city. I only wish The F&B was better as sometimes it's nice to have a great meal in the hotel if you are tired. The other comment I want to make is about the WiFi. I read that only 2 devices are complimentary and I think this is absurd for a 5 star hotel. thankfully, I cleared this up with Yaesu on the first day and he waived all charges for additional devices. Four Seasons, please get rid of this ridiculous rule as most 5 star hotels around the world include unlimited devices for wifi.

From the instant we checked in to the moment we took our leave - not incidentally at the front desk, but rather at the nearby train station as the staff of the hotel insisted someone walk our family of four to the station in order to ensure our Shinkansen tickets were purchased properly - the experience was nothing short of memorable. The spa offered a good array of new machines, while the shiatsu masseuse was expert at her craft. Breakfasts were particularly tasty, offering a wide range of cuisines (only nit to pick was a slight delay in omlette orders, which often were done close to the end of the rest of the meal). A particular favorite - and not something we've run across at many properties to date - were the in-room 3D TVs, complete with the requisite glasses, which almost caused a revolt from children who suddenly seemed less inclined to tour the city. A specific shout out to Yosuke, who walked us to the station and kindly made sure we had the right train tickets, and to Akhil Tiwari, whose smiling face at the concierge desk was a welcome site whether we had a pressing favor (one involved an emergency visit to the US Embassy, and he couldn't have been more calming or helpful) or simply coming back from a long day of walking and touring.

Excellent location within walking distance to Tokyo station; only a 1 hr train ride from Narita so a great 1st stop while you get your bearings.Kind of a funky view of the railway station from the restaurant. Very delicious breakfast. Saw the buffet at lunch/dinner; didn't excite and we preferred to venture off into the night. The only critiques I would raise are: 1) the hallways are covered in carpeting, very nice carpeting, but which smells really bad. That is what happens when you choose carpeting; however they would do well to use, on a daily basis, a good steam cleaning system (GIOELLE makes a wonderful commercial product). It really detracted from my stay.2- The room was really nice, a nice size and well laid out and comfortably appointed. The criticism is that the dark woodwork in the entryway is terribly scuffed up from the constant traffic of wheeled luggage, I presume. It makes for a first negative impression. A pity really because everything is really quite well put together, with excellent quality. ","Ateleta, Italy","melanieag</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ateleta, Italy</strong>",41,4.0

The staff is amazing, they are extremely friendly, polite and always smile at us which may actually may help our daughter came out of her shyness a bit. The service is also top notch, they actually escorted us along the basement to a convenience store when we asked where is the closest convenience store since we didn't see any on the street level and actually wait for us to finish and escort us back. The level of attention my three years old received is amazing, I think she got more attention than we did but that make the whole trip so enjoyable (happy kid, happy mom and dad). We love having breakfast there, the food was delicious (my daughter loved home-made tofu and onsen egg and I loved hot grill salmon where other places often give me cold grill fish and I have not seen onsen egg in breakfast set at other hotel nowadays). However, if you order Japanese breakfast then you will not have much choices. My husband had Japanese breakfast for four day straight (I would have got the same if they change up some vegetable a bit) but being said that, the buffet was also amazing. They have fresh baked croissant which my daughter and myself love so I would say that two day Japanese and two days buffet were PERFECT for me. Also I am addicted to onsen since our other trip around Japan, the onsen in the women spa area are free to use and I don't think people use it as much, the water in the onsen has mineral added which good for your health and skin (I asked the spa attendant) and your skin will feel so smooth after using the onsen. Everyone (at least all women) should use this facility if you are in Japan I used it every day! All in all, because we knew that we will have warm and welcome place to come back to everyday after a long day of excursion, it make our trip so much enjoyable and I cannot thank you enough for all the things the FS teams help us which I can't really put all in here.","Boston, MA","Bos_Mfami</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, MA</strong>",7,5.0

It was my wife and I's first trip to Japan, our first trip together without our children after some time, and my wife's first experience at a Four Seasons property. A man in glasses who worked the front desk during my check-in and check-out was purely transactional. There was no sincerity, spirit to serve, hospitality gene, you name it. Perhaps it had something to do with my wife and I turning down an ""upgrade opportunity"" inappropriately suggested by this fellow upon check-in that would happen to cost an additional USD1,000 per night? The same man handled a straightforward currency exchange for my wife during our stay and failed to follow through on hailing a cab for her. The concierge did not impress. Although always courteous, they simply did enough to respond to my queries and I never felt that they were invested in facilitating for a great stay for my wife and I. We were never asked any questions - no one on the property had cared to ask if we had been to Tokyo before, and what we were looking to do and see. I will give credit where credit is due – the location is fantastic, and breakfast at Motif was excellent. The hotel pyjamas laid out for us nightly when we returned to the rooms was a nice touch, and the restaurant recommendation to dinner at Yakiniku Ushigoro in Ginza was first rate.

Something may have been lost in translation but even we didn't fancy speed drinking. This had the benefit of forcing us to go out and explore the many watering holes in Ginza, of which there are many and no doubt cheaper than the hotel.On the positive side, the staff were excellent, collecting us from the platform at Ginza station, which is a warren of tunnels and walkways. They helped us with restaurant bookings and other queries. We booked a standard room, which was large in a warm wooden colours verging on minimalist. The bathroom too was on the big side and very well equipped. We liked the in-room check in and knowing the room would be cleaned at 10am each day, such a pleasant change from getting back in mid afternoon to find your room still not made up.Being next to Ginza Metro and Tokyo station we found the hotel very convenient as a base to explore Tokyo and get the Bullet train to Shin Fuji.

Thank goodness they did as its a little confusing finding your way out of the subway! The Four Seasons staff are all incredibly helpful, friendly and accommodating and to me that really makes the experience so much nicer and relaxing. The hotel itself is quite small, only 7 floors, the top floor being the restaurant, bar, lounge/sitting room and spa & gym. I had a lovely massage at the spa so I would highly recommend that. Unfortunately I didn't get time to try the gym. Food in the restaurant, which is also the breakfast dining area, was nice and of high quality. The location is great, about a 5 minute walk to the Tōkyō subway and Shinkansen and a little further to the Demaru shopping centre. Check out the ground floor amazing food hall! In the opposite direction it's about a 10 minute walk to the Ginza shopping district. Fabulous shopping, 12 floors of Uniqlo the original flagship store. Restaurants, bars and cafes aplenty. Note that if you haven't been to Japan before, the Japanese queue for everything! They are orderly and queue for a seat for any cafe, restaurant or bread shop! Oh! The Japanese do excellent desserts!!! Another attraction just 10 minutes walk from the hotel is the Emporer's Palace. The palace opens on 2nd January each year and the Emporer gives a little speech. It's one of the two times per year you can go into the palace grounds. If you make it there will be thousands of people. It's well organized and once again the Japanese are very orderly, no pushing. The hotel is a boutique if you can imagine, not as large and commercial say as the Park Hyatt. The rooms are well sized, bathroom lovely. My only disappointing factor for want of a better word is the price / tarrif to stay here. It's a small and limited services hotel when compared to Four Seasons Hong Kong for example but costs the same. Maybe the tarrif is reflective of Japan hospitality.

Thank you, thank you, Ms. Suzuki and the rest of the concierge staff at the Four Seasons! During our week in Tokyo, we managed to lose a wallet, a handbag, and an expensive camera, and everything was recovered thanks to the honesty and efficiency I've found only in Japan. However, that wallet was the proverbial needle in a haystack. It had over $1500 in cash, plus credit cards and documents. Another plus is room size. Who knew you could get so much space in prime Tokyo real estate for such a good rate? The small lobby and highly personal service give the hotel a boutique feel rather than that of a big international chain.Our two children got a lovely, personal welcome. Many top hotels greet young guests with toys, treats, and a note, but the welcome packet at the Four Seasons went one step further and introduced our girls to the children of a hotel concierge. They also received an activity book with recommendations for child-friendly things to do in Tokyo. The coloring pencils were first-rate, much better than the cheap crayons typically given out.However, I am afraid I can give only 4 stars for this review because, as another reviewer remarked, the concierge service does not have any relationship with many of the top restaurants that we would like to try. On previous visits to Tokyo, the concierges at other hotels were able to leverage their relationships with hard-to-reserve restaurants. In Tokyo, where one needs almost a personal introduction to reserve a restaurant, this is important to a foreign gourmet who come to eat here.Because of renovation, there was no restaurant or bar in the Four Seasons. The location within walking distance to Tokyo Station was excellent, but it was hard to meet friends in the hotel. There was not even much of a lobby. Given that we were traveling with 2 small children, this is a hardship.I also have to give very poor ratings for some of the meals we ordered from room service. One very expensive fish dish had an extremely small, overcooked portion--even for Japanese standards.

As other reviewers have said, the train platform service is necessary and wonderful. When we arrived, a hotel representative met us at the train car and helped us with our bags as she took us to the hotel. We also utilized this service to get us onto the Narita Express train at the end of our stay. The hotel representative waited with us until the train arrived, made sure we got to the right car, and helped us get our luggage onto the appropriate space in the train car. The room had an amazing view of the Tokyo skyline and of the trains, with floor to ceiling windows and powered blackout curtains and also powered sheer curtains. All of the curtain controls and the room light controls were next to the two beds. We had a twin sized rollaway bed for no charge for our daughter. The room was spacious and elegantly and comfortably furnished. My favorite was the Nespresso coffee maker and the TV speakers in the bathroom. Everything in the room was conveniently and thoughtfully placed. On the slightly negative side, the room and the restaurant/spa level smelled like stale cigarette smoke. While that would be unacceptable in the USA, it seems to be not so rare in Japan and is probably one of those things that you just have to accept when you travel internationally. The hotel staff brought up an air purifying unit immediately when I noted the smoke smell, even though I told them I didn't think that the smell was a big problem. They really should do something about the smell on the restaurant/spa floor, though--it was significant. Throughout our stay, if the staff said they would do something, they did it immediately and we hardly had time to put down the phone before they were at the door or calling us back. The selection of TV channels was excellent and broad, and you could even order 3D movies at no charge. As is typical of Four Seasons hotels we were treated to a welcome plate of cookies and fruit with our daughter's name on it in chocolate syrup. There was good counter space in the bathroom, as well as a separate large shower and a large soaking tub (from which we could look at the city lights). This is a very small hotel (52 rooms). That's really nice when staying in the most populous city in the world. If you are looking for a hotel up to the standard of the Four Seasons Resorts, this is not quite it. This is pretty consistent with other city-based Four Seasons, though. My only complaint is with the restaurant. We've stayed in many Four Seasons and other luxury hotel brands around the world using our American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts benefit, and this is the only one that did not provide a good breakfast. If the hotels don't have a breakfast buffet, they usually let a person order anything off the menu as the free breakfast for 2. FH&R specifies that there is a continental breakfast that's supposed to be included, but we've never been limited so strictly anywhere else to just a continental breakfast. We were allowed to order off the menu for up to $30 per person. One would think that would be more than adequate to get any breakfast on the menu. Sadly, $30 would only buy coffee and a muffin (seriously). An a la carte bagel with cream cheese was $9 (not including beverage). The food was not exceptional. That being said, I would choose this hotel again. By the way, every staff member we encountered spoke English fluently and greeted us upon sight by name.","roseburg, oregon","marinbean</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>roseburg, oregon</strong>",30,4.0

Size wise, it's more of a boutique hotel and the lobby tells you that. A simple driveway and two small counters for the Front Office and Concierge are all that greet hotel guests. In my case, I took advantage of their complimentary meet/greet service at Tokyo Station. This being my first visit to Tokyo, I was certainly not looking forward to the daunting task of navigating the labyrinth that is Tokyo Station. A member of the bell/concierge team met me on the platform of that my Shinkansen train came in on. Greeting me in English, I felt relieved that I would be able to communicate better with him as I have a very poor understanding of Japanese. I must commend this service as he guided me from the platform to the underground network that led to the hotel (took me a day to memorise the route but once I did, it became easy to navigate from the various train lines straight to the hotel).Upon reaching the lobby, I was usher straight to my room for the check-in. The rooms are located on the lower levels of the building, which lends to the more boutique feel. My room came with an excellent view of the Tokyo Station tracks and I could constantly observe trains moving in and out. Surprisingly, one could barely hear any noise from the tracks. The check-in formalities were completely very quickly. Not only that, but having asked the hotel for assistance with a restaurant reservation, prior to my arrival, I was presented with an envelope containing the restaurant confirmation and a fairly detailed map for the location. Furthermore, the luggage I had sent over from Kyoto was nicely placed in my room and the luggage covers removed and folded nicely in the closet. Bravo. The room itself is rather simple, a bit too simple for my liking but still comfortable. The rooms looks a little dated and could use a little sprucing up, still it was in good condition. The bed itself is very comfortable and the sleepwear equally good.One thing I have to praise is the location of the room's control panel. In most hotels, the panel is on the side table and facing outwards, meaning someone in bed has to adjust his/her body to see which buttons to press. At Four Seasons, the panel faces inwards to the bed, meaning a person in bed just has to turn left or right, very convenient. The mini-bar is rather well stocked and the fridge is big enough to store some of my own drinks. I liked that there's a full length mirror near the fairly big closet. Entertainment wise, the latest 3D TV is available, with a reasonably good selection of movies available for rent from the in-house library. Cables and international adapters were provided, again very helpful and very much what anyone would expect from major luxury chains. The bathroom is spacious enough although perhaps they should have installed a rain shower by now. The amenities are decent, soaps etc from Etro, but the simple plastic wrapping seems a bit cheap. Oddly enough, the spa/onsen amenities looked better than the ones in the room, those had proper boxes that promote the Four Seasons brand. Another issue is that the faucets did not indicate which were for hot water and which were for cold water, so it was a bit of guesswork the first time around. The handheld shower at the tub was also a bit too hot to handle when using hot water, they might wish to look into that. On the whole, minor issues aside, the location is quite unparalleled. Direct links to Tokyo Station meant being able to avoid the rain and the nearby Kyobashi Station meant I could go straight to the Ginza line easily. The staff were also most helpful in securing me a taxi to Tsukiji at 3am in the morning as well as arranging a taxi when checking out. Another praiseworthy act was that the staff called ahead to my next hotel and provided the taxi details, so that when I arrived, I was greeted by name. Excellent way to send off a guest and ending a very comfortable stay.","Singapore, Singapore","Daryllee84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",43,5.0

There was only one person manning the counter. We checked in and found the room to be spacious, with all the amenities we wanted. The restaurant in the hotel and all eating places nearby had closed for the night. We had to dash across the road in heavy rain, to a nearby convenience store (Lawson), for some sandwiches. I had previously communicated with the hotel several times via e-mail regarding my visit, and it would have been good if they had told me regarding the lack of dining options at the tentative time of my arrival. The hotel was a little more lively the next morning, but still very quiet for a luxury hotel. Strangely, there are no restrooms or shops in the lobby area. Fortunately, the hotel is located over the wonderful Tokyo Station which had everything we wanted, including a Tokyu Hands store (within the Daimaru Dept store). We had outstanding service in almost every shop we walked into in Tokyo Station, and were often amused at the way waiters and shop assistants would bow repeatedly and smile and fuss over us, while speaking in Japanese! We generally had a wonderful time in the hotel, and in Tokyo. The room we stayed in deserves a full 5 stars. The lobby is just too small, however. Service too, was not up to 5 star standards. The staff were helpful and courteous, and the concierge, efficient. The young men especially, were very helpful, dashing about with umbrellas when we arrived from our trips in the rain. BUT....there was, to a large extent, a polite restraint which didn't quite do justice to the standards expected from a Four Seasons hotel. The staff often didn't make eye contact, did not look up to greet guests walking out of the lifts (tiny, empty lobby meant staff were less than 10 feet away, and there were no other guests around), and often seemed immersed in their computers and work. No one made any small talk nor did they inquire about our stay, or the trips we made to various places, some of which were planned through the hotel. Perhaps, this was due to a lack of proficiency in the English language among some staff members, although all the staff we met could converse in English.

It actually saved money (not the mention the added on-line shopping time) of purchasing two separate rooms. The confectionary turkey (very cute) that they created on Thanksgiving was a nice personal touch which the kids loved. Of course, the rooms were spotless with the usual comfort and style that one would expect from any FS. The one special difference that made this hotel perfect was the location adjacent to Tokyo station. Tokyo station is a ridiculous labyrinth. The hotel has a service where we were met as our flight arrived at Narita. This service helped us purchase Narita express tickets, Suica card, walked us to the train with our luggage, placed our luggage on the train and showed us our seats. The FS staff met us on the platform and carried our luggage to the hotel. When we took the Shinkansen to Kyoto, they walked us to the platform. Finally, the hotel staff carried our luggage to the Narita express train platform when we departed.While the above may seem relatively simple, anyone who has traveled and experienced the frustration which only detracts from a vacation, understands and appreciates this benefit. To all those travelers who enjoy a good challenge and have no fear of getting lost, good luck in Tokyo station. We are convinced that the Kanji characters for the Tokyo station translate to 'you are now lost'.","Oklahoma City, Oklahoma","chestpain</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</strong>",74,5.0

What we are looking for is a memorable honeymoon experience as detailed by Nanithiya (thank you) as well as a way to avoid hidden extra charges.

Excellence, of course, lives in this domain.We did mention our schedule for one of two days in a message to another member of the 4 Seasons Staff and received a reply recommending that I do almost exactly what had been outlined in detail in the first mail. I was worried then that our message had been given only a cursive glance and the response had been nothing more than a mail signature in which our name had been incorrectly written.

The location is not as exciting as many popular areas of Tokyo, however we found it to be a nice location and not as crowded.

Stayed at the Four Seasons at the tail end of our Japan trip. This Four Seasons is a fairly small hotel so I suggest booking in advance to get the room you want. We stayed in a deluxe premier room. Although we wanted to stay in a suite, this room ended up working out fine in terms of space. We could hear the trains going by but over time we started to drown it out.The proximity to Tokyo Station is extremely helpful for when you are arriving into and leaving Tokyo. FS has a complimentary platform service in which a bellman will pick you and your bags up from the train and also offers the same service when you are leaving. Overall though, the service was not as friendly and helpful as I was used to with Four Seasons properties or properties of similar caliber. We needed to head across town and asked the concierge how to do so. She suggested taking a taxi, which was the wrong idea. It took a LONG time causing us to almost miss our train to the airport. The saving grace was the bellman helping us with platform service. He went ABOVE & BEYOND to help us make our train to Narita. The room service selection was fairly limited given our dietary restrictions. We had trouble the first night getting room service to answer and when they did, it took multiple people to answer questions about the menu.All in all, not a bad stay. Great room.

From the first encounter while planning our trip, the concierge service was exceptionally helpful (better than any other FS we can recall), even through our family's return from Kyoto through Tokyo Station to Narita -- staff met us and led us through the station maze. The location provided easy access to the Imperial Palace and to Tokyo Station for local travel or transit to other Japanese cities. The hotel gym was a good cure for jet lag. The small spa offered a relaxing massage to aid sleep. The restaurant was ideally situated for train watching at Tokyo Station below -- mezmorizing. The restaurant food was unremarkable but we appreciated the 2AM room service (steak and fries) to satisfy a US time zone hunger attack.

On hindsight, we should have followed our initial impressions and stayed at the MO. We love the MO chain and have had many fantastic experiences in their outfits throughout Asia, but given its location near Tokyo Station and that it was closer to the main shopping belt in Ginza and the Imperial Palace, we opted for the FS. We have previously stayed in several FS hotels, but this stay (in addition to our other experiences) confirmed for us that FS has not reached the standards that MO has accomplished. Don’t get us wrong – the FS Tokyo is in no way a bad option, or that our experiences was in any way lacklustre, but we felt that there was nothing particularly special or memorable about our overall stay.Pros:What the FS in Tokyo does excel in is the service rendered to us throughout our stay, though we have come to accept this as part of the norm of fantastic service during our entire stay in Japan. Special mention goes to the concierge staff who responded to our requests via email promptly and made dinner reservations for us, as well as Yuki who brought us to the limousine bus service station and stayed with us till we boarded the coach. We appreciated Yuki's commitment to service very much.As mentioned, the hotel was located very close to JR Tokyo Station which would be excellent for those arriving on bullet train or Narita (Yaesu South Exit). There are also limousine bus services to/from Haneda and Narita airports across the street of the FS. The FS also provides Meet and Greet services at train platforms in Tokyo Station if you come in by train and let the hotel know in advance. It is also accessible to several subway lines which would bring you to other parts of Tokyo quickly for sightseeing and shopping. There are many dining options in Tokyo station itself and the Daimaru department store. As with all the department stores throughout Tokyo, a special highlight was exploring its food and supermarket section. Lastly, the hotel is a short 10-15 minute walk to the heart of Ginza (Mitsukoshi, Matsuya, Uniqlo, Mikimoto, etc.) and the concierge provides a useful map of the vicinity. Cons:If we were to be fastidious and especially given the cost of the room, small and minor details on the part of housekeeping could be attended to more closely. This was surprising given that this was Japan, the land where attention to details is almost second nature. Small touches could be incorporated into the overall experience which we assumed was the norm in many luxury hotels we have stayed in before. This could include leaving a piece of chocolate or a Japanese treat on the bedside during turn-down; or even replenishing the welcome fruit plate the next day. The room could also be kept neater. There was also no hotel booklet documenting the services provided on our desk. We could have overlooked all of these if not for the fact that FS is a luxury hotel in a competitive market. We also felt that there could be some elements of 'Japanese-ness' incorporated into the aesthetics and design elements of the hotel, which could easily be accomplished. We did enjoy the complimentary Wifi and the bed, which was very comfortable for our busy days in Tokyo but the room, while elegant and spacious, was nothing particularly special. It is also surprising that the hotel management has not addressed this when other reviewers have also made mention of this. The FS is a good hotel that has an enviable location especially for those who would like to have access to Tokyo Station and we enjoyed the boutique, intimate feel of this hotel (with only over 50 rooms). However, as other reviewers have mentioned, we do not find it sufficiently compelling to return to stay in it again, unless the price offered was good and if we needed to take a train in Tokyo Station to travel in Japan. Otherwise, we would certainly opt for and recommend the MO the next time we visit Tokyo.","Singapore, Singapore","Nalk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",42,4.0

Lots of tv channels in different languages and a film library to choose from + possibilities to connect your own equipment via bluetooth or cable - a selection of connectors were supplied, 24 hour room service (a little bit expensive though), Bose sound system with music and radio, electric operation of room lighting, curtains and blends from both bedsides, dimmers on the lights etc. The room also proved to be very quiet. The bathroom was also first class with a big tub in the middle and separat shower and toilet rooms plus a big counter with sink, all in beautiful stone and glass, The toilet seat was heated, and had all the gadgetry you expect in Japan. The spacious bath was equiped with nice bath robes, toothbrushes, shaving equipment, hair dryer, magnifying shaving mirror with lights and a good selection of very thick and nice towels etc. In the hallway there was a minibar filled with good stuff, wine, beer, liquors, fruit juices, water plus more. Next to it a cupboard with crackers, nuts, chocolate, chips, a high quality whisky selection, coffee, tea, a Nespresso machine and a good selection of high quality glassware from Schott Zwiesel. The hallway also had a large clothing cabinet with lights and things you may need, like a large brush, slippers, shoehorn etc. It also featured a large floor to roof mirror that was possble to hide for those who doesn't want to see themselves ;-) The hotel has a very nice bar with a quiet and comfortable lounge and a very nice restaurant with a great view of the surrounding area. The service there was also great. Furter more the hotel has a spa, but we never had a chance to try it. There is also a small gift shop. Then there is the location! This hotel is located about as centrally in Tokyo as it is possible to get. It is right next to Tokyo Station in Maranouchi, next to the Emperors park and with Ginza with it's 6000+ restaurants on the other side. Just outside the hotel there was a staircase that led down to the underground station area with access to the subway and the Shinkansen and other trains, e.g. the Narita Express plus what must have been 100+ restaurants and shops. Luxury food stores, all sorts of restaurants and all very clean and nice. We had a great stay and would love to come back. Tokyo is also the cleanest city we have ever been to, we saw no drunks, beggars etc. neither and we always felt very safe. To top it all of, Tokyo didn't at all turn out to be as expensive as we had expected. Coming from redicuously expensive Norway it actually felt cheap.

While all the rooms are on floors 3 through 7 so no huge city views, our room was a corner with wrap around windows along two entire walls so was very bright. There were automated drapes & blinds which worked well to block the light, and proximity to the street didn't cause undue noise. The room was a good size (we paid extra for the Deluxe Premiere Queen room). For our daughter, they had a gift basket prepared with candies & treats. The hotel location is great as you can get pretty much everywhere from Tokyo Station.The restaurant is pricey, but nearby there are many restaurant options. For breakfast we went twice to the restaurant immediately before the entrance to the train station which had snacks & bento boxes; they spoke some English there which was helpful.

I can honestly say that my five day stay at the Four Seasons at Marunouchi was the best experience I have every had at any hotel. I stayed in an incredibly clean, well appointed room overlooking the railway. I found the room to be adequately quiet, despite the proximity to the tracks. I spent many hours in the room either working or fighting my jet lag. The technology worked perfectly at all times, and I felt extremely comfortable. The bathroom was nothing short of stunning - Full marble, separate shower from the giant bath with completely hidden drains (astounding), and at all times spotless. What makes this small hotel stand out is the quiet, dignified service provided. It was overwhelming and at the same time, completely invisible. My favorite time each day was returning to my room at the end of the day. No matter how neat I kept the room, I always found my things better organized than when I left. I was shocked to find my dirty laundry folded each day! I have never, ever seen that anywhere else. When going to the gym, I would arrive at the spa entrance to find no one attending to the shop. Initially this took me off guard, but after a minute, a hotel employee arrived and greeted me. This happened every time I went, and I began to realize that it lent a completely different feel to the hotel - I was being taken care of, but no one was hawking over me. It made the whole hotel feel like it was my own and gave me a sense that the hotel trusted me with their property. At the same time, I always felt that I could have exactly what I wanted when I wanted in an instant. I asked for directions once, and the concierge offered to walk me to my destination. I declined, but I am absolutely positive she was sincerely prepared to walk a number of blocks with me to find what I was looking for. By the way, everyone spoke perfect English - expected, but contributed to an effortless stay.The last thing I will say about this hotel is that I felt like I was home (or at least what I want home to be). It was a combination of American, European, and Japanese all at once. In Japan, which remains perfectly foreign, it is an oasis of familiarity and comfort. I will never stay in any other hotel in Tokyo, no matter what the cost.","New York City, New York","J5855YKdavids</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",12,5.0

Its also a gentle stroll to the fantastic Imperial Palace & Gardens and from the main Department Stores in Ginza.Staff could not be more welcoming, anticipating all our needs and are very friendly.The rooms themselves are reasonably sized for the price, with hi-tech 3D TVs well kitted out bathrooms. Being on low floors the view is not great, and without the drapes down the traffic can be heard (we were on the 6th floor which I believe is the highest floor).Breakfast was average, however the service was excellent.For families the Spa is not great as the facilities are separated by sex, and although there is a small 'Onsen' there is no swimming pool.The hotel bikes that are available are in adult sizes only.Overall I think there are better hotels nearby for families, and similar ones that offer better value for business trips.

Location was perfect and minutes away from Tokyo station. Service was impeccable and the bellman picked us up from Tokyo station on arrival and delivered us and our luggage directly to the train platform on departure. (Shangri-La also picked us up from the train platform on arrival whereas the Four Seasons only met us at the exit so they lost that round.) Their concierges are absolute rockstars and were able to secure me a reservation at Sukiyabashi Jiro Sushi in Ginza, which would have otherwise been nearly impossible to get. The only flaw in this hotel was it's WiFi. While it was complimentary, it was also unacceptably slow (dialup internet slow) unless you paid for the faster service.

Before arrival, I asked for help with shinkansen tickets to Kyoto and the concierge was able to purchase these for me, which took away one headache. On arrival, we were greeted like members of the family and were shown to the most amazing room I have ever experienced. It was so large, it seemed like an apartment and waiting for us was a selection of pastries, orange juice and coffee - just the thing to set us up for the day. The bathroom was a dream bathroom, with an enormous tub and fabulous shower stall, which didn't appear to have any drain - the water just disappeared as if by magic! But the best thing of all about the bathroom was the delicious Japanese toilet with heated seat. You don't know you need a heated toilet seat until you sit on one and find out that your bottom was cold after all! This seat even had two heat settings - perfect for chilly days!We also had a side view of the railway tracks at Tokyo Station which is much more glamorous than it sounds. We watched the bullet trains coming and going - seemed like there was one every minute.But the best thing about the Four Seasons at Marunouchi was the service we received from the delightful staff working at the Concierge desk. We have never been treated so royally in our lives. They helped with restaurant bookings, reconfirmed tours, forwarded luggage, and walked us to a currency exchange desk in Tokyo Station that we could never have found on our own. In fact, they walked us to Tokyo Station on several different occasions - most memorably on leaving to catch the bullet train to Kyoto, but even on our return to Tokyo, when we were on the way to the airport, they met us again and escorted us through the maze that is Tokyo Station to the right connection for the airport express train. We could never have managed this on our own, or if we could, it would have taken twice as long and involved a heart attack in the process. I must especially name two individuals - Jonathon and Miku - who went above and beyond the call of duty helping us with our train journeys. I almost shed a tear when we had to wave them off - it was like leaving a member of the family! I have never before experienced service like this and it makes me want to hurry back to this hotel, just to experience it again.If I could give six stars, or ten stars for this property, I would.

In case this is all you read, I'd agree with other reviews on it: pick one of the zillion other restaurants nearby. The (excellent and helpful) concierge will set it up.As for the hotel, it was excellent and the staff performed perfectly. We usually stay at hotels at this level, and even given the price and level of this hotel, it was excellent.The first thing to note was the reception on the platform of the train station. Yes, a butler was there to meet us as we got off our train at Tokyo station, take our bags, and escort us to the hotel. While this isn't a big deal for business folks traveling alone and already know Tokyo station, for our family who had never been to Japan before, this was a great stress-reducer. As for the room itself, we had a suite facing the train station. While I was initially nervous about the noise (you could hear a faint rumble as the Shinkasen went by) it turned out to be a non-issue and we are NOT heavy sleepers. (And the room was otherwise pin-drop quiet). Meanwhile, the view of the train station was huge amounts of fun, even for the adults.The location of this hotel, as others have mentioned, is epic. It just doesn't get any better. You are right next to Tokyo station, and a block away from the Metro. You are basically 30 minutes (max) from just about anywhere in Tokyo at this hotel.We were in one of the ""normal"" suites. The room itself was not huge, but probably pretty big by Tokyo standards. It was plenty big enough for the three of us.As is the case with other 4S properties, they were very welcoming to children. The room service for breakfast was good, although the menu was somewhat limited. It was a full western-style breakfast though, which isn't easy to find in Tokyo.Room service for dinner was also somewhat limited in selection, but it worked great for what you should use it for: that off night where you simply can't get out of the room or are too tired to walk a block away to a restaurant. Oh, and it's super-expensive but that's not unexpected for a 4S.The minibar was decent, but a highlight was the pod-based coffee machine which makes *real* espresso.All and all, a great hotel, and worth the (very expensive) price.","San Francisco, CA","FamilyXTraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, CA</strong>",67,5.0

There are only really three choices to consider: Shangri-La, Mandarin Oriental, and the Four Seasons. Unfortunately the Four Seasons is last on my list as it doesn't meet the usual Four Seasons standards. Its quite small with only 58 rooms which is quite nice as it has a ""boutiquey"" feel to it but the design is quite dated and the hotel is showing plenty of wear and tear as it hasn't been renovated since it opened in over 10 years. The staff is wonderful which is nice and the location is prime of power shopping. Additionally, there is no breakfast buffet which is a shame as the 4S is famous for their amazing breakfasts.The real winners in Tokyo are the Shangri-La and the Mandarin Oriental. The Mandarin is quite new which is nice and the design is simply fabulous. Same goes for the Shangri-La. All three hotels are near the Ginza shopping district which is by far the best location in Tokyo. Unfortunately the Mandarin is a bit far from Ginza so its not really ideal to walk when going shopping but the Shangri-La and 4S are only about 15 mins away from some of the best shopping in the world. I hate to say this but I think you need to skip the 4S when in Tokyo.

Firstly, the hotel is in a great location - less than 5 minutes walk from Tokyo station, so if you are coming from the airport or elsewhere, you are very close. And don't worry about finding your way to the hotel, because guest services will be waiting on the platform to carry your bags and show you the way. This experience continued throughout our stay - EVERYONE was on the ball and more than willing to help. So we were personally walked to an ATM; taken to the station; had seats found in hard to book restaurants; had customised room service; were remembered and felt taken care of. Our room was fabulous - very large with a living area, separate dressing room and huge bathroom. We had a great view of bullet trains coming into the station. The hotel is quite small, very intimate, brilliantly located for everything in Tokyo, quiet and a lovely place for a 'grown up' break.","Perth, Australia","Catbate</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",24,5.0

The 4S at M is no different - great, personel service (including letting us change in the spa when we arrived early). So, why would you choose this hotel over the others? Firstly, for train buffs, there are great views over the tracks leading into Tokyo station. Secondly, for those using the train (either to/from Nairta aiport or the Tokyo metro) this is an incredibly convenient location. Thirdly, it is the closest 5 star hotel to Ginza for those who want to shop. Fourthly, it is one of the easier hotels in Tokyo to arrange connecting rooms for those traveling with family.Rooms are large with lovely bathrooms. Used room service twice - both times it was excellent (especially the hot chocolate).

The food at the restaurant Ekki Bar and Grill was also delicious and not as expensive as I expected so overall, I would rate the hotel 4.75 stars.Three minor reasons why it didn't get the perfect score:1. Not the staff's fault but the hotel is located on the first seven floors of the building. Our room was on the 3rd floor and you can hear the shinkansen below. Also, for the price, one would have expected a better view.2. The wifi in the room is really, really slow. 3. The suite was very spacious and the furniture was really nice. The tvs are the best (3D tvs with very large screens). However, in the bathroom, there was only one sink and it felt a little cramped with all the toothbrushes, hair dryer, etc... next to the sink.

We have stayed in some of the Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts around the world- the experiences were never disappointed. I have to say, the staffs in Tokyo were the most helpful ones. Before arrival:I have sent several emails to the concierge telling them to help me book the tickets for the Ghibili museum. Also, I told them to help me book our train tickets. They did my requests fast and correctly. I think that the best part is that I received the reply from them the very next day I sent an email to the concierge.Upon arrival:The check-in processes very smoothly. We were accompanied to our room immediately. Warm greetings from Four Seasons Hotel staffs no surprise.During our stay:We stayed in a premier room for a night and a one-bedroom suite for 2 nights. The premier room would be good enough for a family to live in for several days. It was bigger than what we expected from the photo on the official website. The one-bedroom suite is very comfortable, though it was not the biggest Four Seasons suite that we've lived in, but it had the best bathroom design in our own opinion- a free-standing bathtub beside the floor-to-ceiling window overlooking Tokyo station. We had a very comfortable stay in our suite. Highly recommended.Departure:A staff helped us taking our luggages to the Tokyo station platform as we were going to take shinkansen to our next destination. This service helped us save a lot of time finding the platform. Location:3 minutes' walk from Tokyo station Yaesu south exit. There are several department stores and restaurants within 15 minutes' walk. Tokyo station itself is a very big station, no transfer needed if traveling to shinjuku, shibuya, or even Kyoto if you would like to.View:Not spectacular, but kind of interesting and unique. We do enjoy watching trains to and from Tokyo station. Service:Four Seasons standard- even exceeded than normal FS properties!Dining:The breakfast is similar to other FS properties worldwide. In room dining is quite expensive, but there are many good restaurants nearby(within 10 minutes' walk).If there were any annoyance that troubles you, don't hesitate to tell them.

From check in to check out. They even had a service to carry your bags to the train platform for you which was also very useful. Breakfast was beyond disappointing. We booked the room with continental breakfast. This translated into Coffee plus orange juice plus 5 slices of toast with jam. For a hotel in this price category this is unimaginable. There is no buffet and only a la carte breakfast. The hotel is certainly not a high value. The great service didn't compensate for the lousy breakfast or the lack of view.

We hadn't taken another 20 steps when we see Four Seasons reception staff #2 is running towards us umbrella in each hand.For newcomers to this hotel, the hotel actually entirely occupies the four or five middle floors of an office building adjacent and linked to Tokyo Station. There is a welcome reception area at ground level, after which you take one of two private elevators to the main reception. You won't find the activity level you would in a mainstream hotel, but it's vibrant enough. There are no shops apart from a small gift area outside the spa, and with the vast shopping and dining offerings of Tokyo Station right next door, it would be superfluous.

In fact, it made me forget the fact that Tokyo has smaller hotel rooms til just now. The bed was comfortable, we had a nice big 3D TV completed with 3D glasses. There is a list of 3D DVDs you can borrow for free. We had a real living area, which I believe a standard room doesn't really. The bathroom was big. I found a single hair in my bathtub before I used it, but it wasn't that big a deal to me so I didn't report it or anything. There was also a big closet area completed with a full length 3 way mirror. We ordered room service 3 times during our stay. My fiancee likes to eat late at night, and everything in the area is closed after 9 or 10 pm. The food was okay. We had actually expected much better. There was very few Japanese items on the menu, which was a huge disappointment. Indian curry was on the menu but not Japanese curry. Fish and chips was on the menu but not their Japanese counterparts - tempura. I am vegan but when I travel sometimes I settle for vegetarian because it can be hard to find food. Not counting salads, I think there were 2 items on that menu that was vegetarian friendly. I had to have the curry two days in a row. With the growing vegetarian, vegan and simply health couscous population, I really expected more vegetarian friendly choices from this hotel. We had breakfast on both mornings.The food was really good. I liked that you can order a la carte rather than sticking to their set menus.

It's a small hotel (under 60 rooms) with a discrete entrance and lobby, little bar and lounge in the 7th floor - so if you value a certain understatement and minimalism, a very good choice yet you might be disappointed if you expect the usual luxury hotel with huge lobby where the ""see and be seen"" happens. Rooms are large, with the usual details you would expect from a 5* house in Tokyo. Rooms are sound proof, so proof in fact, that I could hear the steps from the room above occasionally. Location is just next to Tokyo station, so just perfect for visiting close-by Ginza and Maronouchi or continue/end your travel in Japan.One word of advice, which basically applies to most 5 star hotels in Japan: You won't do yourself a favour if you travel on a budget, as 15% service fee and 5% (soon 8%) tax is added to every item. Be willing to spend 30-50% of your room rate for extras (and enjoy them ;). I certainly will be back!",Zurich,"aferret</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Zurich</strong>",107,4.0

Nothing like being able to refresh and change after a long flight at the comfort of your room before roaming around the city.

Interior is similar like any other four seasons with some japanese touches (e.g. japanese pyjamas, good quality green tea).Location is super, it's right next to Tokyo station and close to Metro stations as well. Very easy to go anywhere. The neighborhood (Ginza, Marunouchi) has tons of good restaurants, there is no problem at all to get food or coffee. Btw, there is free coffee provided in reception area too. The staff are helpfull and willing to help. We had a wifi modem shipped to this hotel on our first day to ensure we always have wifif connection. The staff gave their best effort to track down the package when we could not find the package in the morning. They called up the party from where we rented the wifi modem and manage to track it down.

In summary, the room was not totally barrier free, but was large enough to accommodate my two small children, my wife and myself - T4 paraplegic in manual wheelchair. It therefore offers a very rare option in Tokyo for a wheelchair user traveling with a family. I ended up in the Four Seasons because I found it very difficult to find any hotel in Tokyo that offered a wheelchair accessible room that could accommodate two adults and two children (6yo and 7yo). There were plenty of accessible rooms (max occupancy 2) and some family rooms (not accessible) but very few with both. After much emailing I settled on the Four Seasons because they offered to put a roll out bed into their large premium bedroom. The service and engagement I received from the staff at the FS during this search phase was excellent and certainly influenced my decision. The hotel is hidden in the bottom seven floors of a skyscraper in Tokyo's central business district. There is level access from the street to a small reception area with hard flooring. The restaurant and bar are on the seventh floor and fully accessible via elevator (lift). Our room was on the third floor and a short distance from the elevator over deep pile carpeting. The room was spacious with plenty of space around the bed (although of course the roll out bed made it difficult to access part of the room by wheelchair). The work desk was very large and the power sockets were mounted on the front and very easy to access. The TV remote was left within easy reach. The minibar and accoutrements were all easy to access as was the closet. All room lights could be controlled from switches by the bed as could the electric window blinds. The bed was at a very comfortable height for transfers - about 24"" or 600mm. The bathroom was very spacious. There was a shower and toilet, each enclosed in their own smoked glass cubicle. Outside of these was a bathtub and sink. The door to the shower cubicle was too narrow for a wheelchair to fit through (52cm - 20.5"") - not even the front castors - so I did not use that (despite the hotel provided a free standing shower seat). The door to the toilet was wide (82cm - 32"") and there was enough room to execute a 180 degree transfer to the toilet. There were grab rails on either side of the toilet for support and assistance. The bathtub was easy to access but was very deep (about 27"" or 675mm) and getting out could be a challenge if you don't have good upper body strength. The hotel will supply a bath chair if required. The bath had a hand held shower rose as well as taps (faucets). The sink had ample under space for knees and the towels were placed within easy reach.Despite some nice decor and excellent personnel the hotel has a kind of impersonal feel to it. The staff were superb and our children were welcomed with personalized guide books and gifts. The room worked for me and I would recommend this hotel if traveling with family. For a wheelie on their own or traveling as a couple I would recommend checking out some of the other barrier free hotel rooms.",MD,"WheelchairTravelNote</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>MD</strong>",42,4.0

Our biggest gripe was that the tiny space devoted to the restaurant/bar is smoking friendly and so renders the entire area unusable for non smokers.

Prior to my arrival they helped me rent a mobile wi-fi hotspot and made the process seamless3). The bell staff was tireless-- one of them walked us to our tour bus terminal, and when we were leaving even purchased a train pass so that she could walk us right to the train platform -- always with a smile, never with any expression that this was too much work or asking too much--- she was excellent-- she remembered where we from, what we had done each day and carried on pleasant conversation effortlessly4) the morning we were leaving I called room service to see if they could make us breakfast sandwiches to take on the train-- this was not on the menu and did not seem like something they had done before-- the results was a beautifully packed box of egg and cheese sandwiches cut symmetrically, arranged perfectly, and without me asking for it also packed two tangerines, two bottles of water, wet napkins, and a container of ketchup.---it was so neatly done I felt bad eating it.Whomever is managing this hotel has done a wonderful job training all of the staf, and is lucky to have excellent, professional people working for him/her.

The location close to Tokyo station was helpful for all of our sightseeing needs. As mentioned by other reviewers they really made an effort for our children. A small gift at check in, cookies, fruit and their own slippers. Our children loved the bathtub and asked to take a bath every night and wanted to use the ""special"" bathrobes.

They were able to obtain tickets for me but I was able to get tickets in the US with an unrestricted time frame.In the hotel, we were on the side facing the station and we enjoyed watching the trains. You can hear the NEX train but it is a low noise and did not prevent any of us from sleeping. The privacy blinds allowed for a great view of the city on the other side of our room. Another helpful reviewer told us that the exit from Tokyo station was the Yaesu south exit.Overall we had a great experience. Some other reviewer had mentioned a lack of detail and that they did not even get water.

Like, the quietest air-conditioning we have ever experienced plus the simplest control panel (no IT degree required here), a dial for temperature and a dial for fan speed - so simple, so easy. Conveniently located near Tokyo railway station (don't worry, you will not hear a single train), we arranged for the platform geeting service - just phone ahead once you have your Narita Express ticket with carriage and seat numbers - for the staff to help you with the 5-10 min walk to the hotel. Unless you are very familiar with this area of Tokyo, I would strongly recommend this service as the hotel street frontage is very discrete - no big driveaway or entrance foyer visible from the street. The hotel is new, modern and the rooms are a generous size by Japanese standards. The bathrooms are large and the room is well equipped with automatic open/close on the curtains - and if you like your room dark, the black out curtains are very good. The reception staff are very helpful, be it with directions, advice or recommending a suitable restaurant nearby. I had a friend meet us at the hotel and he was amazed by the staff not only knowing who were by name but also knowing whether we in or out, in fact at the bar!The bar on the 7 floor looks West over the railway station, financial district and towards the Imperial Palace Gardens. The room mini bar has a wide range of drinks, nibbles and free nescafe pod coffee. Once room service noticed we used ice in our drinks, every night without fail the ice bucket had been refilled.As I mentioned it is the little touches that separate the Four Seasons Marunouchi from the numerous hotels I have stayed in across Asia, like the complimentary coffee with your wake up call on our departure morning. As well as the unique question, ""and what time would you like to have your second wake up call?""

The Bellman even pointed out a few interesting features in the station and assisted us in validating our JR passes. Our room was ready and they were prepared for my 2 children as they had a bowl of treats waiting for them. The room was spacious enough for the 4 of us. Loved the beds, the turndown service and all the little extras that makes it all so special. This is a boutique hotel that goes out of its way to personalize your stay. Decor is ""understated elegance"" with some local elements. We loved the location and would definitely stay here again. The most memorable thing about our stay was how they made our children feel welcome. Our first impression was that it was more of a businessman's hotel considering the location and the ambiance but they certainly know how to pamper their little guests as well. On our first visit, they prepared a little booklet of activities and things to see and do in Tokyo for kids. On our second visit they made a personalized cookie and coloring kit for our younger daughter.

Pros -1) Nice enough room, large for Japan2) Great Bathroom - bath and separate shower cubicle3) Comfy bed4) Location (close to Tokyo Train StationCons -1) NO extras included, all you get for your money is the room: no free bottled water, no breakfast included (which worked out at nearly £50 for two when we did pay for it); only one device connected to wifi per person free (then very expensive to connect any other devises per day), extra for use of the 3D aspect of the TV, the list goes on). This was the most disappointing aspect, as it made us feel like they only welcomed the 'super-rich' and looked down on people like us who were there for a special treat!2) Bar / restaurant very overpriced and average quality with a poor atmosphere, and not a great view compared to other buildings in the area. Also they add a service charge onto everything without first letting you know.3) The staff: they were generally nice and friendly, however check in and out was very impersonal. Also sometimes they could be very overbearing: for example, someone would knock on the room door twice a day to ask if you wanted 'turn down' service. They telephoned the room if you put the do-not disturb sign on the door, which irritated us - we asked not to be disturbed, and telephoning DEFINITELY disturbs.4) Generic looking building inside and out, nothing special like we expected for the price. Overall, our stay at the Four Seasons was disappointing. I'm sure there are equally as nice hotels in central Tokyo for half the price without the cons!

I was pleased to find that to be true. My husband and I spent 4 days there with our 2 boys, ages 8 and 11. The first thing that sold me on the hotel was that we could all stay in one room with 2 queen beds. Most of the hotels in this category had a 3-person per-room limit, and we would have had to book 2 rooms. I made the hotel aware that we were traveling with children and they gave us a room facing the train tracks, as requested (although the US-based reservation agent thought I was crazy to ask for that, but my boys love trains!). When we arrived there were treats for the kids, a sightseeing booklet and kid-sized pajamas and slippers, which made them feel very comfortable after a very long trip from New York. The room was very spacious and filled with light from wall-to-wall windows on 2 sides. Furnishings and amenities were just as you'd expect from a Four Seasons, first rate. The noise from the trains didn't bother us at all. I had a lot of communication via email with the concierge before we arrived to arrange two private guides, both of whom were excellent, and to get tickets to the Intercity Baseball Game, which was the highlight of our trip. The location of the hotel is good in that it is close to several subway lines, and after our first day with a guide we were able to get around on our own. The downside is that it isn't a very touristed area, which might be great for some, but we really struggled finding places to eat. The hotel food is very expensive. We wanted to try Japanese food, but we needed a kid-friendly restaurant that would hold our hand and help us figure out what to order. We tried to explain to the concierge what we were looking for, but they had a hard time coming up with suitable restaurants. On the last night they sent us to a place that they thought might fit the bill, but we didn't realize until we got there that it was cash only and we didn't have enough. So we went across the street and had pasta. Oh well. We had a small miscommunication upon arriving at Narita. We had paid for the airport greeting service, but the woman who met us didn't speak English. So when she took us outside to get on a bus, we were confused, because we thought we were going to take a train to Tokyo station. We also didn't have any yen, so we had to make her understand that we needed to change money, which we thought was part of the point of the greeting service. When we were dropped off near, but not at, the train station, there was no one there from the hotel to meet us, so we walked over to the train station because we thought they were expecting us there. From there we didn't know what to do. Fortunately we had an internationally activated cellphone, so we were able to contact the hotel and figure out where to meet them. It all worked out in the end, but to their credit the hotel apologized and removed the greeting service charge from our bill without our even asking.

The staff are helpful, friendly and professional. We came to Tokyo by Shinkansen from Kyoto and they sent a bellboy, (with good speaking English) to receive us in the platform exactly at the cabin we got off. We went straight to the hotel without wasting a minute and we started our Tokyo adventure within 30 minutes we stepped out of the Shinkansen, my family and I do appreciate it with all our heart.The room is spacious and spotless as we expected, nothing could be complain, complimentary bottles of water, fruit and free fittness facilities for all guests, couldn't be better though the room was not of a very good a view, but still, no complain.BUT, one thing did disappointed us very much, the wireless service is only complimentary to two guest devices. My husband has a computer with him to keep up with his business in Hong Kong and we have, each of us, one smart phone which, I supposed, is not unusual to most of the family nowaday. As soon as the computer was fixed, my husband and I gave up our iphone wifi to our daughter. However, the hotel policy did take this into account and there is always an alternative - you can pay 1000yen and you can get a total of 4 devices connected for 24 hours, how VERY thoughtful they are !!!! Well, we have been to Japan many many times, staying in 4 stars hotels, 5 stars hotels, 6 stars like Park Hyatt, they all gave complimentary wireless service in room. Even the one we stayed in Kyoto, a small one but they provided 24 hours free wifi, stable and always kept all devices connected. It was the first time we stayed in Four Season Tokyo, if we would have known this fact, we would not have chosen it for our stay, honestly. I clarified again, the staff are wonderful and lovely, most helpful and professional, it is this very hotel policy that let us down. The Four Season in Hong Kong is not all free in room, but at least, it is complimentary to four devices. I never have thought that the 1000yen is so important to Four Seasons Tokyo Marunouchi.To came back to our stay, we surrendered at last and paid the 1000 yen, totol 3000yen for three nights, but the wireless connection was disappointing the same. Whenever I left the phone unattended for 10 mins or switched off the phone, the next time I switch on again,I have to go to setting and reconnect the wifi with the Four Seasons again. I just don't understand.... does it really cost the hotel much for wireless connection for your guests? This policy is not very civilized.Lastly, to be fair, everything in our stay is wonderful, the staff is outstanding as I always emphasized, the food in the Hotel Restaurant ""Ekki"" is delicious and the ambience is cosy. And Mr Yuuki san, the staff that helped out with our luggages and accompanied us to the limousine station, and insisted to see us off until we got on the bus safely, is most helpful, his speaking English is excellent, very cheerful and easy going, a very promising staff. If next time my family is going for a Tokyo holiday again, which we certainly will; and if we ever consider the Four Seasons Marunouchi once more, it will definitely be the staff hospitality that is so inviting. And we will try to convince ourselves that the several thousand yen for the wireless charge is our donation for the maintainence to this service. It will be happier to think this way.","Hong Kong, China","BettyChan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",10,4.0

We were a couple taking my niece around Japan for her 16th birthday. Naturally, we wanted her to be left with fond memories of this trip, little did we know that the Japanese standards of service and manners would magically delight us at every turn. The Four Seasons, however, took out a magic wand and bombarded us with surprising treats and touches. Staying there was more like having a very high-end flat in an exclusive residential building with amazing services at our disposal. In order to be fair to the work that this wonderful little hotel is doing, I will break down my review to different categories: staff, aesthetics/physical experience, amenities, location, and service.THE STAFFExcellence in this hotel begins and ends with the staff. They are simply superb. They have managed to find a way of not getting on your way, yet being there moments before you realize you need something, which they will offer before you even ask. Then, as suddenly as they appear, they do their thing and disappear to leave you with your peaceful stay at their hotel. There are many high quality hotels with amazing service around the world, especially in Japan. But the staff at the Four Seasons Marunouchi's know how to leave you with a genuine experience of having been valued. That sets them apart from others. To boot, they speak good English. English Language Skills:The Japanese hospitality industry in general does not seem to pre-occupy itself with making English their first language. We accepted that as another expression of the Japanese celebration of their own culture. But at the Four Seasons, every staff member spoke English well, a few of them in perfect Queen's English. Even the cleaning staff spoke English. That certainly caught our attention. AESTHETICS AND PHYSICAL EXPERIENCEThe Lobby:As other reviewers have said, the reception and public area of the hotel is smaller in comparison with other hotels. This small boutique hotel feels more like an exclusive residential building. Commensurate with that approach, the lobby area is elegant with quiet but high design furniture. The reception desk is a small counter, tucked in the corner near the entrance, with one or two staff members in clean white suits greeting you. There is no sign of the ""business"" operations of the hotel on display, which we found to be a tasteful and elegant touch. The decor is clearly Japanese inspired, but executed in a modern, clean, fresh look using high design furniture, natural materials, and clearly top notch workmanship. Then the elevators take you to your floor where the same design approach explodes into finer details.Our Suite:We had taken a deluxe premiere suite. Contrary to the small lobby, our suite was large and airy. The door opened to an entrance/foyer space, followed by a hallway, with a beautiful dressing and closet area with a fine blond wood finish went floor to ceiling, including large closets, drawers, a three-piece foldable full length mirror. On the other side, conveniently facing the dressing area, the bathroom was huge, with the sink, toilet, shower, soaking bathtub sections separated by frosted glass walls and doors, providing privacy in each section while maintaining the overall experience of the large, spacious bathroom. The bathroom was stocked with top of the line herbal bathing products and all the male and female grooming necessites. Individual fine bathrobes, plush slippers, pajamas, Japanese comfort outfits for around the suite were provided for each family member.Then there was the amazing room itself. One side of the length of the suite was an expansive glass wall with views of the city's skyline and the amazing Shinkansen bullet trains curving on the side. The suite was fully soundproofed and no outside noise was ever heard. There was a spacious sitting area, consisting of a gorgeous couch and two very comfortable, yet sublimely designed (maybe Scandinavian) chairs, a well stocked tea/coffee/drinks area, with the necessary tools and serving necessities. A slender desk agains the glass wall, equipped with a concealed compartment of all the electronic connections one could imagine and a comfortable office chair continued along the wall to make an entertainment console under the large HD TV connected to the wall with an an adjustable connection allowing us to rotate the TV to any side of the room we wanted. The TV and sound systems were amazing. They had a selection of English speaking channels, which became handy later when my niece wanted to chill before going to bed. The beds were very comfortable, complete with duvets and high count pressend cotton sheets. There was an abundance of electric outlets in the most convenient locations, useful to today's travelers, who will each have several electronic devices needing to be charged and recharged in locations near where they want to hang out.SEVENTH FLOOR AMENITIESDespite being a small boutique hotel, the Four Seasons Marunouchi still provides excellent amenities. On the 7th floor of the building, they have a 24-hour gym, male and female spa areas, complete with the most beautifully designed traditional onsen Japanese baths, showers, dressing areas, fully equipped grooming areas, and relaxation areas. The spa provides a list of fantastic treatments that may be received in private treatment rooms or on your suite. The 7th floor also includes a restaurant as well as a tea room/bar/lounge area with spectacular views and exquisite furniture. The optional breakfast includes a set Japanese option, an American option, or a combination of their a la carte options, all of which are divine and served at a table in the restaurant. LOCATIONBeing steps away from the Tokyo Central station, with a variety of long distance and subway train lines, buses, and taxi cabs right there outside the door, the Four Seasons Marunouchi is perhaps in the most accessible location in Japan. More like Mid-town Manhattan than the village, the Ginza area where the hotel is located contains an array of shops, restaurants, and most important sights, including the Imperial Palace and Gardens. Other entertainment destination are just a subway or JR train ride away.SRVICE! SERVICE! SERVICE!Instead of using more superlatives to explain the quality of the service in this hotel, I will give two examples, which should tell the story.Example 1 (Delight): At the time of our arrival, the check-in staff overheard that this was a trip to celebrate my niece's birthday. They said they would like to send us a complimentary cake and asked how and where we would like to have it. Later a pleasant lady showed up at our door at the time we had requested to deliver the cake. Well, it was much more than a cake. There was a beautifully handwritten birthday card, which every staff member in the hotel had personally signed. Imagine my niece's delight to get that. The lady then set up a beautiful little spread, including a gorgeous fresh fruit topped cake and other snacks. Then she asked if she may take a photo of the three of us, which we agreed to do. At check out time, they surprised my niece once again by handing her a print of the photo they had taken, framed beautifully in a Japanese frame and attached to a fine Japanese card with hand-painted watercolor markings and another personal message to my niece. Example 2 (Unreal):Our departure flight was scheduled for early evening. Before checkout, , as normal, we called the frontdesk to arrange for our luggage to be stored in the hotel for the remainder of the day while we would do some final shopping and sightseeing. At the pre-arranged time, a staff member showed up with a cart and carefully arranged our luggage in a way that our bags containing our fragile gifts were protected. He asked what time our train to the airport would be leaving. Then he asked us to be back at a certain time to be sure to catch our train on time. When we returned to pick up our luggage, another person in clean formal uniform and white cotton gloves had already prepared our luggage on a smaller more compact cart. We thought he was going to bring the luggage out to the sidewalk or something like that. But no, he wanted to make sure we got to our train on time. He graciously pushed our luggage through the confusing maze of the Tokyo Central Station, used his own subway card to get through the various pay-gates, and walked us right to the train. When we proceeded to take our luggage, he wouldn't have it! He personally put our luggage in the luggage compartment of the train, made sure we found our seats, then he bowed, thanked us and left. Oh, by the way, they don't accept tips in Japan and he wasn't hustling for tips. This is just what they do at this hotel. We were astounded!No wonder the Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Marunauchi keeps making number 1 on TipAdvisor's list of Tokyo hotels! We will be telling everyone we know that, if in Tokyo, they should consider staying there.My family and I would like to thank the staff at the Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Maranuchi for making our last night in Japan our best night there and making this one of our most cherished and memorable trips ever.","Los Angeles, California","H H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",56,5.0

The bathroom was spacious with tub and great shower. Our reservation included breakfast, which was a semi a la carte menu. Great choices, well prepared and the service was excellent, kudos to Gerard the restaurant manager who didn't miss a thing, directed staff kindly, and checked in with all the guests. Dinner was excellent too and clearly included non-guests. The bar area was nice to have a drink and watch the trains coming and going, no noise to be heard. Background music, modern R&B, didn't really match with the crowd, but that was minor. The spa was nice, small, but good services. Little things make a difference, in the relaxation room were reading glasses available, very thoughtful.The location is excellent for shopping, or walking to the Imperial place. Cabs are reasonably priced and next to Singapore the cleanest and most efficient in the world. However, public transportation is also excellent. Upon departure, we were walked to our train, which is helpful in Tokyo Station, which must be one of the if not the busiest train station in the world.

It is right next to Tokyo Train Station, and they will pick you up and bring you to the hotel. This is after a 50 minute Narita Express train from the airport. Everything in the hotel is very efficient, the staff anticipated our visit, and had thoughtful reception gifts for both of my children, personalized cookies in the room. After the long trip we all were exhausted, the temperature environment was perfect, linens inviting, but first we bathed in the nice sunken tub, had excellent room service and were sleeping within 2 hours. Since we were on another time zone we awakened in the middle of the night, hungry again, and of course the room service is ready to serve. After the middle of the night meal we decided to take a early morning walk. Although the concierge was not helpful in this regard, however luckily we found a very nice park after circling around the back of the hotel walking toward the Imperial Palace, and turning to the left toward Hibya Park, and was lovely--very fragrant flowers, and ponds and places to sit and relax had it not been for the rain. Do not expect the concierge to be helpful beyond dispensing maps, and giving instructions to the taxi drivers. I would recommend having a plan ahead of time, then going ahead and booking a car for the day to follow a program. We wanted to go to the fish market to see this famous site, but apparently it was closed for the day as communicated by the concierge. We did not hire a car for our daughter can communicate in Japanese a little and we were able to get around a little bit. We visited the Sky Tree, and the Edo Tokyo Museum, and both were interesting. The hotel sent a bellman with us to help us obtain tickets for the Shinkansen to Kobe, he even helped my daughter to attempt to perform the transaction in Japanese (he had spent 4 years in Santa Barbara to learn English). He helped us to the platform and train, and to set up our seating arrangements. Great service, and everyone in the hotel will refuse tip, so avoid embarrassment and keep tips in your pocket. The service in the restaurant was perfect. Some of the dishes, i.e., the sashimi was not as fresh as I expected, but everything was nearly perfect. The room was great, we had two rooms, 614 and 611. It would have been nice to have 614 and 615 to link the room so we would not need to walk down the hall to visit each other. Room 614 was a corner room, overlooking the Yesasu Street action, as well as the approaching and departing Shinkansen bullet trains.

This hotel turns any notion of that on its head.The location does not get any better than this for a business traveler, in Marunouchi, just off Ginza and minutes away from Tokyo central train station and three other subway stops on foot. With only fifty-something rooms in this ultramodern low-rise building, the staff to guest ratio is incredibly high and the concierge service is one of the best in Tokyo - and that is saying something. The rooms are comfortable, well-designed (as are the bathrooms) and typical Japanese touches such as pajamas, dressing gowns, slippers etc. are provided as standard. Everything is well thought out, the only downside being that the views from the wraparound ceiling to floor windows are either of office buildings or...the railway tracks. The gym is small but well equipped with the same views as the rooms and there is an excellent spa on the same top floor. The restaurant is very good and the bar service impeccable - large, custom ice cubes in the highballs melt slowly so as not to dilute your drink. What really puts this over the top in my view however is the service. When I had misplaced my wallet - something I only discovered after I ordered dinner at a Michelin two-starred restaurant - the guest relations staff immediately responded to my calls and went up to my room to search for it. When they couldn't find it, one of the staff called the restaurant at the conclusion of my meal to get the bill, and promptly cycled over in a few minutes with the requisite payment in cash! He then put me in a taxi and sent me back to the hotel. This was after an earlier misadventure due to a failure on the part of Apple maps (Japan) which necessitated a walkthrough by phone to guide me to my unmarked destination which is no mean feat in Tokyo where addresses are not in any logical pattern.","New York City, New York","Dreddlox</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",44,5.0

I would like to add some info that I discovered only upon staying here, despite having read lots of reviews. Our deluxe double room was really configured like like a junior suite. It was one large room with a king-sized bed. The sitting area had two comfortable lounge chairs and a very comfortable sofa, in addiiton to a very large executive desk, bench with leather seat and wooden inset, and coffee table. Most of the room had floor to ceiling windows with a view of the comings and goings of the trains from the nearby Tokyo Station--lots to look at and absolutely soundless! There are four very accessible plugs in the room for US appliances--one by each side of the bed, which is great for computing or reading your Kindle in bed, and two at the desk. More outlets are available from the front desk if needed. The tv has 3D DVD and special goggles for watching! The bathroom has a private compartment with Japanese toilet, complete with bidet and heated seat, a soaking tub, and a nice shower. The bathroom amenities are plentiful and thoughtful--2 toothbrushes with toothpaste, a razor with blades, a collapsable brush, an emery board, a comb, and Occitane products. The health club is adequate and the spa services are reasonably priced for a big city. The food and drink are expensive and very good. IThe only down side to this lovely hotel is that it has a lobby bar/restaurant and a restaurant with a rather uninspiring menu of continental cuisine. But I guess that's to be expected with such a small hotel--and it's not as if there's nowhere else to eat in town! We are taking the bus to Narita because we have so many suitcases that it will be difficult to handle them at Narita. According to hotel staff, who were kind enough to print our boarding passes at no charge, when you go to Narita by train, you arrive at Narita in the basement, where help with baggage is not likely to be available. We will be getting assistance from the hotel staff in taking our bags to the bus terminal, which is 5 minutes away by foot. The bus costs $30 per person, takes 90 minutes, and drops you right at the terminal boarding area.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Stephanie K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",63,5.0

Family-friendly enough: While the modern hotel has more of a business feel, we traveled with our three children, and the hotel was very comfortable for our family and, typical of Four Seasons style, the staff was very kind and accommodating to our kids. We were able to get adjoining rooms. The special touch was there too -- for instance, they provided gorgeous personalized cookies on plates and dishes of snacks for the kids upon arrival.  Exceptional Concierge/Service: For instance, the staff walked us to the bullet train and to our airport shuttle down the block (and carted our luggage for us). They offered to accompany us to find the correct subway in Tokyo Station. They went the extra mile to help us whenever we had questions or needs. Nice Rooms: The rooms and bathrooms were very modern and spacious. L' Occitane products were in the bathrooms. Our rooms overlooked the train tracks with some very slight accompanying noise, but it actually was fun and interesting to watch the bullet trains come and go.  Expensive: Also typical of Four Seasons, room service was crazy expensive (around $45 for a cheeseburger). Basic wifi in the room was free but pretty slow. They arranged our bullet train tickets for us, but the service charge of $50 per ticket was hefty and this probably should have been done gratis given how easily I did it myself on a return bullet train trip.

We had a wonderful time at both properties, but want to highlight the differences for those who are trying to make a decision (or decide when to stay) between these two first class hotels.The Four Seasons Marunouchi is a small boutique property located in a business high-rise one block from Tokyo Central Rail station. This makes it very convenient when you arrive from Narita airport as they will send a representative to meet you at the Narita Express train platform in the confusing maze that is Tokyo Station to carry your baggage and guide you to your room. The location is excellent if you want to explore the train station (which is a city in itself) and discover the amazing cheap eats of Tokyo Ramen Street (a must visit) to have the best Ramen on earth at Rokurinsha which is listed in a separate review. If you want to go to Tsukiji Market to witness the tuna auction the Four Seasons will book a taxi to get you there (at 4:00 am) in less than 15 minutes so you are essentially guaranteed to get in. The differences between the Peninsula and the Four Seasons relate to personalized service, location and amenities offered. We loved both hotels, but for different reasons. If you are arriving from the US, I would suggest staying arriving at the Four Seasons and completing your stay at the Peninsula. The Four Seasons concierge staff in Tokyo is the best that I have encountered on numerous trips worldwide. Through their kind assistance, I was able to book (difficult to obtain) reservations at Sushi Mizutani and Ryugin, as well as purchase box seat tickets to the Sumo tournament in Osaka. They also arranged for personalized (meaning meeting us and taking us to the platform) train transfers at Tokyo station for our arrival from Narita and departure to Kyoto. I would like to personally acknowledge concierges Yoko T. and Akhil T. who were exceptional in assisting us in all of these endeavors as well as explaining how to navigate the subway system so we could explore Tokyo independently.We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite (a very pleasant surprise) which was excellent in fit and finish albeit with a view of an office building and a large city boulevard instead of a park view like the Peninsula. The only negatives of the Four Seasons relate to the lack of a large lobby lounge (if that is your preference), as well as a lack of an indoor pool (nice if you have kids), and impressive views from your room (unless a view of the Shinkasen is what you desire). Despite these minor negatives, I tend to prefer small boutique hotels (which was the feel of the Four Seasons) and absolutely loved the rooms, service and location that this hotel offers. I also felt that the Four Seasons was the perfect way to introduce yourself to this vibrant (but complex) city (Thank you Concierge Service!) while the Peninsula was a great way to finish our trip (which has a lobby lounge, swimming pool and nice views but less personalized service) once I was acclimatized to Tokyo and the Ginza district.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","SlickWilliam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",24,5.0

The JR train lines were right outside the window but we couldn't hear a single sound so the windows must be sound proofed really well (and of course, trains in Japan are really quiet too). So we got the metropolitan feel from the view yet without the noise. I'm a huge, huge fan of L'Occitane so of course that was one of the main factors when deciding to choose the Four Seasons since they provide this brand of bathroom amenities. The hotel also provides turndown service which is a nice luxury to have especially when we were out the whole day and then returning to see that our room has been prepared for us to retire for the evening. Comfortable bed, plush bathrobes, towels... we only wished our stay could be longer.Practical tip:You can walk between the Four Seasons and Tokyo Station via the underground walkway without having to go outdoors. We didn't know it the first time but thanks to the helpful tip from the reception desk, we managed to walk to Tokyo Station and back without getting wet when it was pouring rain and wet. The underground walkway has many things to discover.. shops and restaurants that lead you all the way to Tokyo Station which on its own is a world of its own with so many restaurants and shops. My husband joked that we basically could spend days between the Four Seasons and Tokyo Station without having to step outdoors at all.","Chicago, Illinois","terinay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",104,5.0

The rate normally includes an upgrade in the next room category, free breakfast, a spa voucher of 100$ and early check-in / late check-out. All these benefits are according to availability, the hotel is not compelled to provide themWe were upgraded in a luxury suite of approximately 980 sqf. We obtained free breakfast and a 100$ spa voucher.The hotel is located in one of Tokyo's best locations : GINZA. Architecturally talking, it's a modern and design one, occupying 7 floors of a 35 storeys building. However, it has its own entrance so that we are totally independant from the building's activityRooms are oversized and decorated with quality furnishings. Zebrano wood pieces are mounted on some walls or on the ceilling increasing the sensation of luxury. Insidie the suite, we didn't hear any noise, doors, walls and ceilings were completely isolated. There was also a lot of technological devices (117 cm 3D plasma screen with glasses, upscale 5.1 home theatre system, air purifier, japanese toilets, electric curtains, intelligent lights system...). Every details were taken care of to create an atomosphere where traveller feels comfortable and at home.The service was perfect night and day. Whatever your needs are, concierge, reception, or room service staff quickly answer and meet your expectations professionaly and gently. If you plan to book a fine restaurant, the concierge will recommand the best ones that are not made for tourists. For example, we wanted to dine in an upscale sushi restaurant. The concierge suggested the Seamon. It was really an unforgettable experience (intimate atmosphere, michelin star graded, true sushi masters and great food)The hotel's main restaurant proposed an inventive cuisine with good ingredients in a room with panoramic views of the city. However, this hotel deserves a better one. If they recruited an uprising Chef (not Alain Ducasse or Gordon Ramsey) and they proposed rich ingredients (foie gras, caviar, lobster, fine fishes and sophisticated meat dishes) together with upscale wines (Petrus, Mouton Rothschild...), this restaurant could get one or 2 michelin stars and could become the place to dine. Such a hotel needs a top class restaurant...The spa and the fitness room had great amenities and were not crowded. I recommand the free onsen bath, a kind of japanese poolWe travel all around the world and stay in the best palace hotels. This hotel has no opulent style but combines luxury and design. I can assure you, this is the place to stay in Tokyo. It's by far the best hotel in every aspect of your stayIt is highly recommanded.","Paris, France","flight2626</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",21,5.0

The reason this Hotel rates Number one Chiyoda is because it is simply the best. My Family and I recently had a four night stay at Four Seasons and we all experienced a wonderful stay. Right from the moment when the Concierge met us at the Shinkansen Station upon our arrival to when they escorted us to the Narita Express on our departure, the service and hospitality was outstanding.Four Seasons is positioned very close to JR station and only a few minutes walk into the Ginza district which is one of Tokyo's prime shopping locations.We had 2 adjoining rooms on the 6th floor which were very large and had all the convenieniences and appointments one would expect. All the amenities provided were of the highest quality. The rooms were very quiet and had a great view over Tokyo JR station.We used the restaurant and bar most days for breakfast and dinner and sat next to the open gas flamed fireplace each night for a few drinks at our happy hour. We got to know the staff here as this is more like a boutique hotel where the service is tailored to be more personal than perhaps a 500 room hotel may offer. This what we preferThe concierge was very helpful in arranging tours and providing maps and directions plus the wonderful meet and greet service provided at the train station is first class.We used the onsen regularly and even took up a few massages and spa options. My 2 boys used the Gym and remarked how everything was in perfect working order and condition. Overall, this was the best hotel we have stayed in and I could not recommend it highly enough for a one night stop over or as your base for an extended stay in Tokyo.

Booked it having stayed at FS Singapore and loving it. Stayed four days at FS Maranouchi with my husband and our two teenage boys. The deal breakers for me were the excellent central location near Tokyo station and also the fact that we could all stay in one decent sized room. We got one of their website ‘stay four nights for the price of three’ which helped hugely. The rate was still up there but similar to getting two rooms for ourselves in this very expensive part of Tokyo.Have since found out about booking through the FS preferred agents which entitle the guest to extras. I would urge anyone looking at FS to look into this. I wasn’t aware of it till I read some flyer forums.I looked at other locations near Tokyo Station like the Mandarin, The Palace and the Peninsula but decided this was the best, A+ in fact, with a short walk to the Ginza and next to Tokyo railway station Yaesu South exit. I feel to get the most out of your stay in Tokyo you have to stay very near one of the big connecting stations like Tokyo or Shinjuku. Then your down time catching trains is minimised.We got a premier queen room of 52sq m, it was very nicely appointed, comfy beds, luxury bathroom and lots of storage. FS kindly lent us a PS3 with some games for our 13 year old, fortunately he was so busy with tripping around Tokyo it didn’t get used much, but a nice touch nevertheless.The concierge were outstanding, they helped us with arranging Sumo tickets and were prompt replying to emails before we arrived. Akhil at the concierge desk was particularly helpful and welcoming. The icing on the cake when we left was when a lovely young man from concierge accompanied us to catch the Narita express on departure and navigating the myriad passageways of Tokyo to the right platform and also helping us purchase our tickets and get our Suica card refunds. We think we’re savvy travellers but we couldn’t have found our way to the N’ex without the young lad who helped us and even took the luggage trolley down through the station! BTW ALL the staff at Four Seasons speak good English, right down to the housekeepers.Just a couple of pointers if you stay at the F/S Marunouchi:There’s a convenience store in the complex below the building, turn right outside of the main entrance towards the ginza, cut the corner right, over the plaza, towards the railway bridge and take the escalator down when you see the basement entrance. The store is right there.Don’t forget to take a walk along the Nakadori St in the close by Marunouchi area, a gracious, upmarket shopping area, where you will really get a sense of the results of a country that has experienced economic growth for the last 50 years. The Christmas lights down that street were absolutely breathtaking when going for a night walk.Take the Skybus hop on hop off tour, starts at the Mitsubishi building a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Will give you an overland view of Tokyo.The Muji flagship store at Yurakcho (5 minute walk) - I'm a shopaholic -is a fabulous example of anti brand, products that are environmentally friendly in a Japanese way. The Loft shop next door is like a kind of target store with everything from nail clippers upwards.To sum up this Four Seasons isn’t about wow hotel receptions areas, it’s about giving service where it makes a real difference to your stay. The service levels are well above average in a city where there is lots of good service.","Wellington, New Zealand","urbanite88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",318,5.0

Small business hotel with beautiful well sized rooms and lovely decor throughout. Very convenient location next to Tokyo Station. Staff and service was excellent throughout - absolutely up to standards we have seen and come to expect from the Four Seasons - nothing was ever too much trouble. We used the Onsen but not the gym. The gym looked great. We were also given a late checkout which was very greatly appreciatedI thought the room rate was great. However what was completely ridiculous was the price of food and drinks in the hotel restaurant and via room service. As an example we paid circa US$32 for two hot chocolates from room service for the kids. This is insane in the extreme. Sure we should have looked at the price before we ordered but nobody in their right mind could seriously think anyone would charge this much. This extended across everything - US$11 for a coffee, $30 for 2 eggs, $12 for a couple of slices of toast and so on. We averaged $12-140 for breakfast each day. We copped all of this but it just left a very sour taste.My wife made the remark that the prime customer is a business traveller who is not paying out of their own pocket so they don't worry and don't complain. This makes some sense. However we stayed at the Four Seasons Beverley Wiltshire and we found the exact opposite - ie the restaurant prices were very good.In many respects they would have been better charging a higher room rate and making the food and beverage prices close to sensible.Would we go back - as a family it is a definite no because of the issues above.",Sydney,"Robert-J01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",35,4.0

Rooms are spacious and well appointed. Concierge falls all over themselves to be of service--- gave us step by step directions to anywhere we wanted to go plus drew it on a map plus gave us phrase cards to use to show people if we got lost (our Japanese is limited).

We stayed in Osaka at the St Regis and could not have been treated better by the staff and level of service provided. We finished our trip in Tokyo at the Four Seasons Marunouchi, only to find it to be a complete flop. The hotel is not that nice to start with and it is small. Four Seasons sold us on it as being five star. It is NOT. Maybe a two to three star. There was no butler service as we were told there would be, there is only on ""casual"" restaurant. I was told that there was a couple and the nicer one required a jacket. (The manager of the restaurant told me they never have had a jacket policy.) The conciegre service was poor at best. When ask to provide maps, they did not. They also told us a cab was waiting outside the lobby door for us during a rain storm. It was not, unless you consider 2 blocks away being just outside the door. My wife had to go upstairs to get something for our children one day, as our children and I waited in the lobby. The greeter thought we were just in there to get out of the rain, until I gave her our room number. The restaurant service was horrible. After finally getting our food, we were three quarters of the way thru the meal before our tea and colas came to drink. This was after three attempts to get it from the waiter, two attempts to get the manager to get it done and finally I went to the bar tender and told her that she either get my family something to drink our I will go to the room mini bar and get the colas out of it. We never did see the waiter again. The manager finally brought the beverages to us. The food during that meal was not that great either. It was, however, well over priced. We had to repeatedly order coffee sweetener and creamer. They would only bring a few packs at the time to the room for the free coffee service.The internet service never worked properly for the two computers unless you paid for the package. Then, we ended up having to order two of those as it did not work the four units it claimed to support. This was NOT level of serivce we received in Atlanta, GA Four Seasons, nor was it up to the level of serivce from the St Regis Hotel in Osaka that we stayed at. This was a total disappointment. We called the corporate office about it and the woman there wanted to argue with me about our experience. She continually told me they have never had any complaints about this property. We discovered that there is/was a second Four Seasons property in Tokyo, quiet by accident, as our taxi driver took us to the wrong one. The Four Seasons corporate told us today that as of 31 Dec 12, they no longer have the second property. After reading reviews online, it sounds as though that other property had many of the same problems that the Marunouchi property has. It seems that the entire staff needs to be sent back to the ""old style"" Four Seasons school to learn what five star service really is. My wife and I both question whether or not we ever want to stay at another Four Seasons property after this. What we got in service should have only cost one third of what we were charged. A lower level Hilton or Sheraton would have been more comparable to what we got from this location.",charlotte,"TeufelHundenguy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>charlotte</strong>",97,2.0

The rooms are very large, larger than the apartments of my Japanese friends, and they are beautifully designed and maintained.One of the best parts of the hotel is it's gym and spa. The gym is great and the spa includes an onsen bath in a slate cave--a great place to decompress after a long flight or day in Tokyo. The spa services are excellent. The last time I stayed here I had a 90 minute ""tree of life"" and was really impressed how far it transcended the typical hotel massage. The massage therapist was extremely well trained, combining a gym-massage understanding of anatomy with the relaxing art of a balinese massage.Throughout the hotel service is excellent, attentive and helpful. Although I've been to Tokyo many times, I lazily accepted the offer to be escorted to the Tokyo station to catch the train to the airport. This service really exemplifies the hotel's above and beyond service. It was very nice for me, and I can imagine it could be amazing for someone visiting Tokyo for the first time to be picked up and looked after.This is my third time staying at the hotel, and my only gripe is that the food isn't as good as it was when it opened. Then the restaurant ekki seemed on track to become one of Tokyo's special top restaurants. Instead of soaring, it has slumped and now served first-class hotel food. Nothing wrong, but nothing memorable. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here if I weren't staying here. The night I stayed, I booked through American Express platinum and my rate was extremely reasonable. This hotel feel like it should cost at least $1400/night. That it feels like such excellent value made it that much more enjoyable.The location is ideal, lots that you can walk to, trains to take you anywhere else.","New York City, New York","Gandaratravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",176,5.0

I poured through the reviews here for the top hotels and finally decided on this one because most people said it was quiet, close to transportation and had great amenities. I have to agree on all points, it was an excellent stay.Since it was my first time in Tokyo I opted for the greeter at the airport, which I understood I would pay extra for, but it was worth it. She was extremely efficient and managed to get me on the train to Tokyo in 15 minutes from the time I got out of customs...and that was with a stop at the ATM! The greeter at Tokyo Station was also great and very necessary since the train and the hotel are at opposite ends of the station, and there was construction going on which was further confusing. I might still be lost there if she hadn't guided me to the hotel.The staff at the hotel were all great. I was meeting a friend to celebrate a special event and they not only prepared the little welcome champagne I asked for, they also put together a congratulations note and signed it from the staff! I thought that was a very thoughtful touch.The spa, the bar and the restaurant are all top notch. Food was great, drinks were great, tea was wonderful, spa treatments also excellent.As some had recommended I asked for a room not facing the station and the one we got was quiet and huge, and wonderful.One thing I don't remember seeing in other reviews is that there are a lot of good places to eat really close. There is a French bakery/bistro in the office building, several types of restaurants in the basement (Korean, Japanese, Chinese, etc.), you don't even have to go outside. And just a block away is another building with maybe a dozen restaurants of all types, ""fast food"" in the basement and Mexican, Spanish, Chinese, night clubs etc. on two floors above the street. It was nice to have so many options so close to the hotel.If I have one piece of criticism and advice, which for the seasoned travelers might be obvious but I was really tired when I got there, it was that I wish I had figured out how much cash I would need, and the exchange rate, before I went to the ATM, really before I even got to Tokyo. The greeter at the airport suggested I would only need a little because everyone takes credit cards and she recommended 10,000 yen. As I only had a few minutes to get to the train I just went with that. She then proceeded to use the 10,000 yen to get my train ticket, which took a hefty chunk out of it and made me realize she had woefully underestimated how much cash I would probably need considering cabs, convenience stores, etc. I did use credit cards for a lot of things but I definitely needed more than 10,000 yen to get around Tokyo for the time I was there.

The hotel also provides (for a fee) a meet and greet service, where their representative will meet you outside of customs and escort you to the station and help buy tickets and get you to the platform. On the other end, at Tokyo Station, their staff will meet and escort you to the hotel (which I don't think I would have found without them!). The rooms are super-comfortable and modern. As the sign in the bathroom says, don't be afraid of the toilet. It is a Toto Washlet, which looks complicated and intimidating, but is actually very efficient, and these toilets are found in most restaurants and public restrooms. We ate breakfast upstairs in the restaurant every day, and while it was good, I would have liked to see a little more variety in the menu.

Our room was excellent though, high tech, great beds, 3d television and very spacious. However we overlooked train tracks and although the windows were solid, we heard light rumbling every 3 minutes, slightly annoying.The thing though that was really bugging my companion and I was that the place was too tucked away, too corporate and far too quiet, it was just a bit depressing.

The Four Seasons at Marunouchi is small (57 rooms), has a forgettable hotel appearance in a skyscraper as well as forgettable lobby, rooms, halls and dining spaces in terms of decor. Service is efficient not always effective for example I booked with my AMEX Platinum and received some special deals like a $100 spa credit but was told when I booked a shiatsu massage that it wasn't covered under the credit because it was an outside vendor. After a look of disappointment, the staff checked with the powers-that-be and I was granted the use of the credit. Also, be careful when you book the staff to meet you at the airport. It isn't their staff. And Four Seasons charges $80 just to meet you and show you to the train entrance!!! The worse add-on was the required 15% service charge to compensate for the fact that the Four Seasons either doesn't pay its staff well and/or it is a ripoff to high paying guests. Mind you service was very good for which I had been tipping unaware that 15% was automatically added on to EVERYTHING including when you use the Conceirge to book a tour. The restaurant food was good not great. The menu was simple and only included one Japanese item for breakfast and one or two Japanese food items for dinner. The portions are small and I left hungry after spending $100 for a soup and entree. The room was luxurious, had many nice amenities, a bathroom you would want to have forever and a bed with a choice of pillows. Would I stay at the Four Seasons Tokyo at Marunouchi after spending $2,000 for 2 nights? No, it was not the luxury value I could get at say a Raffles where the service is exquisite and endearing, they don't nickel and dime you every chance and the experience is more memorable at a more fairer luxury investment.","Ambra, Italy","MarcoPro2050</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ambra, Italy</strong>",236,3.0

I have been there many times and never gotten anything but the best service from warm and helpful people who try so very hard to make your stay comfortable.For those new to Tokyo, or if you travel with lots of bags, the hotel will be more than happy to send someone to meet you at the railway station. The hotel is only about a 5 min walk from Tokyo station, but if you are not sure of your way around the station this can be of a bit of help. If you hit Tokyo station at rush hour, and you have bags, it can be a bit of fun to get out. :-)On my last trip they knew I was on my way (because I 'tweeted' my status) and were kind enough to meet me at the door and made me feel welcome. I was even a little surprised that they were following my twitter feed. The social media team at this hotel go above and beyond! Each and every one of them adds to the value of this hotel.The hotel rooms are great, and very large by Japanese standards. The location, a short walk to Tokyo station is perfect if you plan on traveling around Tokyo area. While Marunouchi area is very business centered, the proximity to Tokyo station makes it perfect for the tourists as well.The restaurant in the hotel is very good as well, with great views of the Shinkansen as they come and go from the station. They put on special dinners very often, so it may be worth asking the hotel if they have one going on when you are there. They are very well done and worth a try. Lots of more casual places to eat in the area around the hotel. Most to them setup to feed the 1000s of people that work in the area and that offer a mix of price points.I can not say enough good things about this hotel.

We had been looking forward to visiting this property for a number of years and we were not disappointed. We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay: highlights included the service (of course!), the restaurant (particularly the great breakfasts) and the location (right near Tokyo Station and the Ginza). Our room had a view towards the Ginza, yet was quiet and very comfortable. The bathroom is beautiful in a typical Four Seasons way, and we enjoyed the L'Occitane amenities. The decor was a bit more subdued than some Four Seasons properties, likely because it feels more Japanese and slightly less Western. Overall, the room felt very calming. The service was typical Four Seasons: excellent. The restaurant staff in particular were very friendly and helpful. The bar - taking up part of the lobby and the entrance to the restaurant - felt a bit less special than some of the other FS properties we've visited, but it wasn't bad.

They do the same service on the way back. What a pleasure.Since they know you are on a train, your check-in is flawless, and everything is ready for you, with someone waiting to bring you to your room.We've never had a bad view, but since the rooms are only up to the 6th floor of the building, look out and watch what appear to be the most organized ants going to work in the morning.Breakfast is a treat (a bit expensive, but this is the Four Seasons, so it's expected). However, everyone knows who you are, remembers what you had the day before, and brings you that extra cup of hot water for your tea, without even asking for it.Room Service - Took about 30 minutes, not too bad. But get this, the food cart has a warming part, and your food is HOT when it arrives.One night we arrived back in our room with a bottle of champagne and berries, as a thank you. Now, I would assume not everyone gets this, but it was greatly appreciated.There are umbrellas at the front door, bikes to borrow if you want to be adventurous (or just ride around the Imperial Gardens), and the door staff always knows your name, and makes sure you had a good day, typically escorting you to the elevator.Only 57 rooms, that are quite large by Tokyo standards.

However the Four Seasons Tokyo and Marunouchi even exceeded our high expectations and is perhaps our new favorite property.The small scale of the hotel allows for extremely personal service. We were traveling with our 7-year-old daughter and felt that the staff sincerely enjoyed meeting her and talking to her. Not JUST her, we were all made to feel very welcome and even special but the way our daughter was welcomed was exceptional. The hotel had cookies for her in our room, small-scale robe and slippers, bath toys etc. Small touches that collectively really added up to mean a lot.At one point we asked about which bullet train to take for a day trip and a member of the staff not only walked us to the station and ordered the tickets for us (in Japanese) but then purchased a ticket for himself so that he may enter the station and walk us all the way to the actual train making sure that we were all set and on our way. Later when it was time to check out another member of the staff walked us (and all of our luggage) to the terminal for the bus to the airport, waiting at the station until we actually pulled away.

That standard of servise has now been blown out of the water by the staff at the Four Seasons Tokyo at Maranouchi.Is the hotel beautiful, comfortable and in a great location? Is the food nice? All these things were true about this hotel, but it does not speak to the best service we have ever experienced. I should preface this by saying we arrived in Tokyo after spending 6 weeks on The Crystal Serenity cruise ship. We had been pampered and attended to by some of the best in the hospitality industry. This stay equaled and in many ways exceeded the service we had recieved on the ship. And it came down to the people employed at this extraordinary hotel.Two examples: Our daughter had flown in from Los Angeles to stay and see Tokyo with us. She wanted to go to the Studion Ghibli museum, and we agreed. To buy tickets we needed to go across the street to a kiosk inside a convenience store. The bellstaff gave us detailed information before we set out for the store to buy tickets. However when we got there we reached an impass when we couldn't operate the machine correctly. My husband went back to the hotel and asked for help. Immediately one of the staff came back with him, helped us get the tickets and then walked us several blocks to a subways staion to get to our destination. When we returned from our day's adventure, whoever was at the bell desk would address us by name, and ask how our visit to ""____"" was, as they knew what we were doing on a daily basis.The second and most personally touching moment for me during our stay was when my husband had a medical problem that necessitated a visit the St. Luke's Medical Center. When we go into the taxi, and looked out the window on our way to the hospital there were 3 or more employees bowing and wishing us well. When we go to the emergency room a Dr. greeted us and took us to the registration counter and paved the way for us to communicate in english. I attribute the care we recieved at the hospital to the staff at the Four Seasons. Thank you so much.Several people have mentioned the restaurant in the hotel, and I want to recommend the breakfast there. It is, like most things in Tokyo expensive but so worht it. The breakfast starts with an amuse bouche yogurt drink, and the pastries were very good, as was everything else.Bravo to the staff and management. You have set the bar high.

The hotel's only restaurant (ekki Bar & Grill) was very good. I had an excellent dinner there. There are tons of places to eat at all price categories within easy walking distance of the hotel.The service levels are great. The front door, front desk and concierge staff are all very helpful. Local travel arrangements were made much easier with their assistance (especially Japanese instructions to taxi drivers and train ticket agents) and restaurant suggestions were great. Take advantage of the hotel's platform greeting: the Tokyo Train Station is quite large, and if you are a little groggy from a long flight, it is easy to take a wrong step.A few tips:1. FSH instructs you to take the ""Yaesu South Exit"". As you get off the train from the airport, there are only Yaesu Central and Yaesu North signs. Follow the ""Yaesu Central Exit"" signs until you see the ""Yaesu South Exit"" signs. And if you happen to miss them, no big deal: the Yaesu Central Exit will take you were you need to be (you still turn right when you reach the main street).2. Taxi's are widely available and are exceptionally clean. The driver has a switch to automatically open and close the passenger door. They are a bit expensive but not overly so. Most don't speak any English so have your Japanese destination instructions with you and be sure to have return instructions for the hotel.3. Definitely go to the Tsukiji Fish Market. And you don't need to get up at 4:00 am. While I missed the auction, I went down about 8:30 am and saw lots of action in the inner market. Also, it is unbelievably clean with no ""fish smell"" at all. Great sushi is available in the outer market. All-in-all, very impressive!4. Kamakura, about an hour from Tokyo by train, is a great place to visit for the day. It is a quant little village with about 15 shrines and temples within close proximity. It is a great place to walk and english signage makes it easy to get from one temple to the next. Please note that the station immediately before ""Kamakura"" is ""Kita-Kamakura"". You can get off at either station though ""Kamakura"" is at the centre of the town.5. Excellent ramen noodles at ""Ippudo"" in the nearby Marunouchi Brick Square. (This was recommended by the hotel.)",West Vancouver,"BASLJM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Vancouver</strong>",44,5.0

My wife and I had many long conversations with staff members to ask for help with various things, and they never once made us feel rushed or that we were taking them away from more important things. During the middle of our trip, we left the city for a few days to see Kyoto and Hakone, and when we returned everyone remembered where we had gone and asked about our trip. One of the best services they offer is meeting you at the train station and walking you to the hotel. It's a wonderful way to arrive in the city. When it was time for us to leave Tokyo and take the train back out to the airport, Kaye walked us all the way to our train, made sure we got on the right car, and then didn't leave until our train took off.

From checkin to checkout we had a wonderful stay. The Manager, Daniel Simon, was there to greet us upon arrival! Having been to Tokyo several times I am used to expecting smaller rooms. We were upgraded to an executive suite which was simply impressive in décor and amenities. The AV system is very modern (built in) and we used both the living room and AV systems to play our music and watch a movie from our iPad on the large flat screen TV. A super nice touch is that all the cords you need are provided.The bathroom area was well stocked with L’Occitane toiletries of every kind and not the tiny little bottles which only last 1 night either. Deep soaker tub, separate shower and spacious walkin closet in the bathroom area. Service was impeccable – not once did we ever see a housekeeping cart or even a door open for cleaning during our stay. Staff always greeted us by name and speaking English was not an issue at all.They have a Nespresso machine in the room with a frother. A really nice touch is they include a container of milk in the fridge – forget tiny creamers or the like. The Nespresso pods were always replenished – even the milk during our stay! Turndown service always occurred without request. The staff were helpful at every encounter. Bottles of water are included at the bedside (there is nothing more annoying than a 5 star hotel charging for bottled water in the room!)A very nice touch is that the 1F entrance has a Jura machine for making coffee/cappuccino as well as juices in the mornings. The gym has several treadmills, free weights and lots of fixed machines. The fitness room is located in the spa and one can use the locker rooms, as well as showers/steam room and onsen in the locker rooms. Again – wonderful amenities and nice lockers.We had our room facing Tokyo station and I agree with other reviews, this is not a negative as watching the trains come and go was very enjoyable – and the floor to ceiling double paned windows kept out any noise.The small number of rooms – 57 in total – really makes this hotel a winner. Everything feels so personal and intimate. Quiet elegant luxury. Well worth the price – a home away from home in Tokyo.We did not eat in the restaurant so can not comment on it. We did have a wonderful meal at Tateru Yoshino in Ginza.The location adjacent to Tokyo Station can not be beat for connections to Narita, and travel outside of Tokyo. We used both the subway and train.Hint – buy the Suica + N’Ex pass from the JR ticket office when you arrive at Narita. You get quite a savings on the Narita ticket (available only to foreign visitorss) and the Suica is much more convenient than buying tickets","Toronto, Canada","SLin96</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",156,5.0

The true measure in my eyes is the service culture - and FS Marunouchi has one of the best I've ever experienced. It is clear the employees have pride in their hotel and so they should. The rooms are small in number but exceptional in standard. The single restaurant is simply outstanding so there is no need for a second one - full marks to Gerard's team.(although the breakfast music did make us try to pick the tune from pre 70's middle class America...)Jonathon at Concierge is a great front man - by the time he's picked you up from the train and led you to your room you know the stay is looking good. He's funny, helpful and completely focused on what you want from Tokyo.The rest of the team don't disappoint. They don't want you in the rain without an umbrella, in the lift unless they can press the floor button, on a lounge chair without at least a glass of water or on the subway without one of their own easy to follow printed maps. (and, yes, they will walk you to the station if your unsure)This hotel does have other bonuses. (I almost feel like saying ""but wait there's more..."")It's so central it could be nicknamed ""Bullseye"". On top of the main train station with it's underground shopping centre, the hotel is just minutes from the Ginza district, the Imperial Palace and gardens, a short 20 minute trek to the fish markets and in close proximity to the subway system.My family think like I do, and it would seem like a lot of other reviews, this is a lay down choice for Tokyo.

I was in Asia on a mileage run to maintain that all-important 1K level on United for 2012.Overview:This hotel is the smallest Four Seasons (FS) property that I have ever visited and probably the smallest in the chain. The one FS that I have the most experience is with the Istanbul-Sultanahmet property and this hotel has only 65 rooms. Ergo, the Marunouchi property is not a typical FS. The hotel is indeed a boutique property - meaning it has only 50+ rooms, one restaurant and the staff consistently addressed me by name. It is located in an office building - with its own entrance but not well marked - and next to Tokyo Station (which, of course, is great for the Narita Express). The spa and gym facility is small but so is the hotel, and I rarely encountered another guest in the spa or the gym. I loved the onsen and used it three separate times to sort out a bad back. Incidentally, during my three uses of the onsen, it was my private bath since I never saw another person. Room:I did receive an upgrade to a junior suite (room 506) which overlooked the train station, but the train noise was inaudible and I enjoyed watching the trains arrive and depart. The bathroom was large with a separate bath and shower, and toilet was in true Japanese tradition - you needed a PhD to figure out all the buttons. The bathroom amenities were ""standard"" FS - l'Occitane. One reviewer complained about the difficulty using some of the room's gadgets but I had no such problem with the two TVs and the window curtain, though I remained puzzled about the toilet (don’t worry – there is a handle). There was also an upscale coffee machine in the roomDining:I did not have room service or breakfast in the hotel. Dinner was very good and cheaper than the $200 meal the next night - but just as good. I did take the free morning coffee and pastry on the ground floor, which I think is served until 8:00am. The lounge is divided into two parts - smoking and non-smoking - and both overlook the train station. The restaurant is non-smoking. I despise smoking but this is par for the course in Japan, and seemed less of a problem at this FS. I met the new F&B manager, who is a Japanese-speaking Aussie. Highlights:My experience with the onsen was already noted. I took the FS bicycle around Tokyo with no problem, with the exception that the helmet was too small – even for my bald head. I enjoyed the Japanese reaction seeing a ""gringo"" riding around the streets of Tokyo. By far the best experience was having the hotel’s general manager – Daniel Simon – provide me with a personal tour of the Tokyo fish market … at 5:00am. I had a couple of chats previously with Mr. Simon when he was the hotel manager in Sydney but this act was far beyond any service that I have ever experienced at any FS hotel – and I considered it exceptional, even by FS’s legendary standards. While you should not expect a personal tour of the fish market from the GM at 5:00am, it indicates the type of service that you should expect. Lessons Learned in Tokyo:- Carry cash. Many places do not accept credit cards and bank ATMs – even those of major international Japanese banks – did not seem to accept US ATM cards. The post office ATMs did accept my two US ATM cards.- Take advantage of the complimentary FS “greeting” service offered upon arrival at Tokyo Station. I did not. I was confused leaving the train station, which was made worse since it was at rush hour. Also don’t be cheap … take the Narita Express for a few extra bucks instead of the local train.- Anywhere I went I had the hotel write in Japanese my destination and/or exactly what I wanted – such as kabuki tickets. I found English proficiency limited, even amongst the young. This is not Hong Kong. Language was never a problem at the hotel, but particularly when the Japanese-American woman from Chicago was working at the lobby entrance. - After a day I figured out the convoluted Tokyo subway/underground system but never could figure what priced ticket I needed. I just paid the minimum fare and then paid the difference upon exiting the station – no penalty.- Tokyo is an expensive city.","Santa Monica, California","SanMoTraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Monica, California</strong>",18,5.0

This is without doubt the best Hotel from all aspects, service, cleanliness, location, rooms and value for money.We landed at Tokyo Narita airport at about 7am, negotiated the Airport and managed to get the Narita Express to Tokyo Railway Station.

Fully armed with these details we managed to find the correct exit (Yaesu South Exit - But Yaesu Central will do equally well) and turned right and after a few minutes walk saw the entry to the hotel.As you enter you we encountered Japanese Hospitality for the first time. In the ground floor entry there is a concierge desk, we reported in (this was about 9am) knowing we were far too early for formal check-in we left our bags with the concierge and went out for a morning stroll (armed with our map) to explore the local surroundings and get some breakfast. The concierge was most apologetic we were not able to check-in immediately and they could not have been more helpful in looking after us for these first few minutes.We returned later in the day to the hotel, and as we entered the ground floor concierge area we were welcomed by name! Very impressive. We were escorted to the reception desk on Level 7 and did the usual check-in things. Again we were formally addressed by name. Our luggage had been put into the room for us and we had been upgraded to the most splendid room on level 6.I had my customary Gin and Tonic when on holiday and the service was outstanding (again called me by name - how do they know that? My belief is that the staff are trained to memorise names and faces, just going one step further than any other hotel chain we have stayed in.)We slept like babies and then enjoyed a delightful breakfast in the ekki bar and grill - food perfect!Then we had to check out. As we were travelling to our next stop in Kyoto I asked the concierge about how to get the Shinkensan. Well that started a frenzy of activity and we were royally escorted to the station by a member of the Four Seasons staff who expertly took care of all the bookings and seat reservations for use. She even saw us to the correct carriage explaining how the doors all line up and the various carriage numbers and where they align with the platform. This young girl was great she even struggled with our luggage for us. Well and above the call of duty I thought!!When we returned to the Four Seasons a few days later we were again met with wonderful friendly smiles and called by name (these were genuine smiles and a genuine welcome back - most welcoming!)Again we were given a wonderful room with tremendous facilities. Again we had to book seats on the Narita Express for our return trip to the airport. We mentioned this to the concierge desk who said 'leave us your information and it will be done overnight' and it was!! We picked up the tickets the next morning and again escorted to the railway station and ushered onto the train.We both enjoyed are brief stays at the Four Seasons and because of the experience we have agreed to return to Tokyo for a longer stay. We will be staying at the Four Seasons during our next visit. In fact we will be utilising the Four Seasons on other forth coming trips as we have been converted by the experience of this stay.Staff were absolutely wonderful; nothing was too much trouble for them - my thanks!!Rooms and all the facilities were excellent of the highest quality.I strongly urge visitors to Tokyo to stay at this hotel.Four Seasons - Domo Arigato",Melbourne,"dojc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",24,5.0

It's only 1 hr Keiyo-line ride from home.I tried ekki bar & grill, the only restaurant there.It was Saturday so they had weekend brunch only, which I didn't intend to have, the price was over my budget. So I asked for a la carte menus, took a loot at and ordered sea-urchin pasta, priced 2400jpy (w/10% service charge). It was superb!I've never seen that much sea urchin on one plate for a person. More sea urchin was on the plate than the pasta. The sauce was delicately made, the sea urchin heated in a various degrees. They also served breads, 3 different kinds. The pasta itself was light on the portion, but with the bread eaten w/the leftover sauce, it was like heaven.I was so full, so I didn't want to eat anything more, not even a cake.So I ordered OJ (1200jpy plus 10%), which was ok, but a way bit pricy for the juice. Actually, MinuteMaid OJ is better than theirs. So, I'd love to return there and eat sea-urchin linguine again, but without OJ. I'd like to try their set menus, but the food comes as very big portions so the ladies at the table beside mine were declining desserts, saying they had too much. I wish they'd have set menus with less food and cheaper prices (say, around 2500jpy, w/coffee or tea, and petite dessert).","Chiba, Japan","alexandra_w</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chiba, Japan</strong>",37,4.0

Tokyo Station is just a 5 minute walk away where you can connect to JR and Tokyo Metro lines which allows travellers to easily access any part of Tokyo.

We live in difficult times, and I will no longer hand my money over to hotels that give an inferior service. Japanese hotels are not cheap, however on the whole they can be the best. And I can say that my stay at the Four Seasons at Marunouchi was a very happy, smooth, classy experience.I'm writing this review from the perspective of someone who was in Japan on business - and this hotel worked for me on many levels. I like the fact it's small. I like the fact it's discreet. I rarely saw anyone unless I went up to the bar and lounge area. And I had a lovely big room that I was very happy to work in, watch TV in, and which endless Shinkasen silently race past my window .... and I was thrilled with my bed - a good hard bed. Oh, and the bathroom ... I could have taken a football team into my wet room for a shower. Excellent!At a few hours notice the hotel found me an excellent translator for an incredibly important business meeting, and not at an over-inflated price.I could also happily work on my laptop upstairs in the bar/lounge and feel so at ease, and hours would just slip away. No one pestered me, or bothered me. As is typical in Japan, the right level of attention was given.The Japanese staff were lovely - as were the other nationalities who worked in the hotel. There's an excellent African American gentleman who works in the bar area - he was slick, personable, and really took care of people.For my needs the location was very good. I found it easier to walk to Ginza subway station than try and tackle the huge Tokyo station which is currently under renovation. But I always have plenty to do in the Ginza anyway - and if you want to shop, then you NEED the Ginza. Everything from Chanel, LV, Prada - even Barney's New York are here.If I'm making the Ginza sound like an expensive area, it is. However, there's lots of little places to eat which are not ridiculously priced, especially around/underneath the Shinkasen train tracks, everything from noodles to sushi to the fabulous Freshness Burgers. Or eat at the hotel - the food was 1st class.If you want a buzzier evening and the Four Seasons is a little too sedate, then The Peninsula is about a 12 minute walk away ... yes, you should go there for a drink and enjoy the fabulous views from the bar. And I have also stayed there. But I would never stay at The Peninsula again, whereas I'll definitely be staying at The Four Seasons again.

Spa facilities were really tiny, just accommodating handful people at the same time. But to our surprise, their skills were truly fantastic. Be sure to make a spa reservation in advance, and don't miss it. Cons-As this hotel is really small, you'll have very limited options everywhere in terms of facilities.In addition, the service was not up to our Four Seasons standard. Needs more staff overall (probably they were on ""emergency shift"" due to disaster, as the hotel had fewer guests). Spa reception was not manned and difficult to find staff. Bar was not that fantastic, a bit on the ""cheap"" side somehow. If you are to stay in Tokyo on business only and the location is a crucial matter to you, FS Marunouchi is not a bad choice at all. Very good access to JR Tokyo Station.

They had no recommendations on hand for somewhere to dine locally (we found a great spot in the Marunouchi Bldg nearby) and were generally a bit underwhelming.

Right from the people manning the door downstairs, to the concierge with flawless recommendations, to room service. The attention to detail is stunning. Of all the four seasons I have stayed in this easily has the best service. Keep in mind that I am benchmarking against hotels in the same chain which is a high bar to start off with. Here is an example. Kids mean Tokyo Disney, approached with dread by parents all over. I am referring to Disney in general and not singling out Tokyo Disney. Getting there entails taking the metro and there is a station with a direct train about a 10 mins walk. But we have a stroller and Tokyo seems to have been designed with the firm intention of discouraging kids and the use of strollers. So a staff member escorts us all the way to the train. She knows every cunningly hidden ramp and elevator. She even buys a metro ticket so that she can take us right into the train. I marvel at this and swear never to choose any other hotel in Tokyo.

We were greeted warmly when we arrived (though we got there before check-in) and they presented my daughter with a toy. They also brought up a personalized cookie for my daughter once we were settled in our rooms. The rooms were decorated very tastefully in neutral colors.

The platform greeting at Tokyo Station was really super, though I'd agree with others who felt awkward watching white-uniformed men and women sweating and toiling for us as we addled along with nary a care in that labyrinth!Our corner room - premium, double-queened beds that are so, so hard to find in Asia! - was fantastic. Extremely simple decor and lovely bathroom were appropriately Japanese cool. Two walls of glass to view the twinkling lights and bullet train wonderment and automatic shades alone kept my kids enraptured. It isn't true that you don't hear the trains - we did - but somehow it became more of a benign white noise. Service was impeccable, though the concierge had a tough time understanding that casual Italian or Tepanyaki with kids simply doesn't translate to ""jacket required"" types of places. The true weak link for us was the food. Excellent teen hamburger but inedible ""spaghetti"" and since we had wonderful spaghetti elsewhere it isn't that the dish doesn't translate. We just ate (mostly Japanese food) elsewhere. Amusing/charming that they supplied toddler tumblers and tiny bath robes for kids even after asking us to confirm their ages (9 and 13) twice! Gym was small and okay, not great, but locker room had a nice onsen. Loved it.I so love that the FS meaningfully welcomes families who enjoy traveling -- it's why we selected it in Tokyo even when other locations seemed more obviously appropriate for us and though we typically try to stay at more local-style hotels. The staff made sure our son had a separate rollaway and somehow made it luxurious, they never failed to greet us with smiles, and really took care of us for the duration, whether it was waking at 3 for Tsukiji or responding to obscure art-related questions.

Since we had never been to Japan before we did a lot of research to attempt to find the perfect hotel for a family stay - basically it was between this hotel and the peninsula, but we chose four seasons marunouchi because of the extra service that we thought would be available for the children. Unfortunately in practice virtually none of these services were actually delivered. Initially we booked premier rooms but when we found that these rooms did not face the train station we switched to the smaller superior rooms - that may be why we didn't have the extra services, so check before you book. We were expecting (based on prior reviews on this site, and information available elsewhere) welcome gifts for the children, child sized bathrobes and toiletries, and a special age appropriate childrens treat, such as milk and cookies, delivered on the night of arrival. Unfortunately when we arrived there were no welcome gifts for the children (which was sad since I had mentioned this to the kids prior, and yes they were very disappointed - bad daddy), the child sized bathrobes we finally found 1 in each room (in the closet behind the door) - same with the too small kid slippers, and absolutley no childrens toiletries (we had not brought any based on this information so will have to purchase in the morning). Of course given this track record our expectations were definitely lowered so that when we returned to the hotel the night of our arrival and found no cookies in sight we were not necessarily surprised, but the childrens disappointment at these ommisions cannot be overlooked. The reason we picked this hotel over the Peninsula is that this hotel was definitely advertised as being family friendly by offering these ameneties - where the Peninsula charged extra for these types of services - so if you are considering these two hotels for a family stay I would seriously consider the Peninsula over this location - you get what you pay for.Further, on the lack of attention to detail side - several weeks before we arrived I called ahead to have a playstation installed in the childrens room (the one that was supposed to contain the small robes, toiletries and cookies). Of course when we arrived there was no playstation in either room, so I went down to the concierge to request one. The concierge confirmed that there was a playstation available and that it would be delivered immediately. 15 minutes later my son came over to tell me that they were installing the WII. Not a playstation, but a wii, so I went next door to once again (for a 3rd time) request a playstation but my son intervened (I think he was happy to get anything) so we settled for the wii. This is a very nice hotel and the staff is very kind and helpful but when expecations meet reality it is shown to be less than favorable on balance. If you are looking for that perfect family experience at a 5 star you might consider somewhere that these services can be purchased - or at least one that has a swimming pool. There are no extra services available for children here, and honestly why bother to gather age and gender information for the kids if that information won't be put to any use?. Also don't expect to be shown the ameneties of the room upon arrival - checkin was very quick - bascially here's your luggage, sign here please, goodbye. We spent the next 20 minutes figuring out how to work the blinds, the lights, the toilets (yes, the toilets took a bit - kind of high tech for an American), the TV, etc... Its a very luxurious and high tech room, and figuring out all of the controls took a bit of investigation.I would also qualify this as a potential difference between the premier and superior rooms, but none of the premier rooms face the train station - so if you have your heart set on this hotel for a family stay - call ahead!",Johnstown CO,"PaulHRiesberg</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Johnstown CO</strong>",6,3.0

I entertained some business associates on a Sunday afternoon, and tea for three was an eye-popping US$50-ish, but I guess that should compare with the cost of a quiet meeting room rather than a tea bag or two.

The Four Seasons Marunouchi is located adjacent to Tokyo station in the heart of the central district so it is very convenient for sightseeing via subway to almost any area of Tokyo and is within walking district of the Imperial Palace. The hotel is small by comparison to most other hotels in the area but is big on service. From the ""Welcome Cookie"" plate our 7 year old received to the robes and kimono's sized just right for our entire family the hotel does it well. We dined at the hotels' restaurant ""Ekk'i"" and whilst it was on the pricey side as most of Tokyo\s restaurants are it was excellent food and service and we took advantage of the half price wine offer which made the dinner bill a bit more reasonable. If you are a train enthusiast you will love observing the Bullet train entering and leaving the station right from the view from your window..but you don't hear them as the hotel seemed incredibly soundproofed. If you are looking for some more reasonable places to grab a bit, try the Cafe Paul, just around the corner from the hotel in the plaza where delicious fresh light foods and bakery made the most mouth watering treats and coffees. The only disadvantage is they don't open til 11am so the morning coffee is a long wait. That is also consistent of all the shops and amenities in the surround area which was disappointing when as Westerners you wake up early for the day. Make sure to visit the Fish Market also near by for eye popping discoveries and a visit to a Tea Ceremony is a must also in Tokyo. One final thought is be prepared to plan ahead for dining and make reservations as we found that if we showed up without we were almost always in for a long wait.","Kelowna, Canada","kemac2016</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kelowna, Canada</strong>",42,5.0

It is as good as depicted in previous reviews. We were met by a hotel rep once we got off the Narita Express at Tokyo Station and the hotel was a quick 5min stroll. They did not have a room available for an early check in but they did store our bags for us while we went for a stroll around the Imperial Palace and had lunch. The room we had (superior with King bed) was lovely, and the bathroom was stocked with L'Occitane products. The hotel provides free WI-FI which I had problems accessing on my iphone in the room, but it works perfectly in the lobby. They did try to get it to work but it appears that WI-FI access via the iphone can be problematic in Japan.All our requests for information was attended to competently by staff, whom all spoke perfect English. They checked Shinkansen times (although I already knew which ones were suitable for our travel plans) and offered to purchase tickets for us (Additional Service charge and tax applicable). TIP: go on an adventure and get your own tickets from the Shinkansen office at Tokyo Station, it is not difficult and the hotel can precheck the times for you. All restaurant recommendations were fantastic.The location of the hotel itself it great. It is next to the major train station, and close to Ginza. Roppongi is a bit further away. There are great restaurants close by.At the end of our stay, they assisted with our baggage and walked us to our Shinkansen. The little lady who sent us off even wanted to help with our huge luggage, but my husband decided it would be ungentlemanly of him to carry nothing.I will definitely stay here again. The service was excellent, even compared to other hotels in the Four Seasons chain.","Singapore, Singapore","Beanui</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",41,5.0

We paid $60 for airport transfer to the Narita Express (train from the Narita Airport to Tokyo Station). The airport agent met us after customs and immigrations, took us to the nearest ATM, train ticketing machine, rushed us to the train and contacted The Four Seasons with our train car number and arrival information. ""Meet and greet service"" was an outstanding complimentary service offered by this Four Seasons Hotel. The hotel agent then met us with a luggage cart outside our train car in the busy Tokyo station. He led us through the maze to the hotel where we were able to check-in inside our hotel room. We booked under the “buy 2 nights, get one free” for a total of approximately $1,000 for 3 nights stay in the smallest room. The sleek room was comfortable with modern appointments including, smart room technology, a bathroom TV, fancy Japanese style toilet, luxury vanity items and a deep tub. The triple-paned windows provided a very quiet stay despite the adjacent Shinkansen Train Station next door. We do not speak Japanese and were glad to find that the staff all spoke excellent English. They went out of their way to ensure our comfort, providing area information and facilitating tour purchase (hotel fee was 10% of ticket price). We enjoyed the “Dynamic Tokyo Tour” and also spent a rainy day in Kyoto. A group of students provide free site seeing tours to show off their historic city while practicing English. The Four Seasons staff always greeted us by name and provided umbrella use (it poured during our time there) and complimentary water. They prepared a delicious cake for my birthday! The business center allowed free internet access. Modern spa facilities were available. The hotel thought of everything, including loan of athletic wear should a guest require. Nothing in Tokyo was inexpensive and the hotel restaurant was no exception. A breakfast of hot chocolate and waffles would cost around $25; dinner ran about $50 per entree. Thankfully, we discovered a Starbucks two blocks away. We would unconditionally recommend this hotel because of the courteous staff, beautiful décor, nice spa, helpful services, and great location.",San Diego,"TouristSanDiego</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",96,5.0

Location is very good, a short distance from Tokyo station. I chose to use the greeting service as this was my first time in Tokyo. As it turned out, finding ones way to the Narita Express was rather easy, ticket boot included. However, I would recommend this service if you for instance need to get things done at the airport before going to Tokyo (such as picking up rental phone etc), or if you don't feel like doing the job of finding out arrival time at Tokyo Station and then call the hotel and setup a pickup time. Because I would strongly recommend that you use the hotel's pickup service at Tokyo Station (which comes at no cost). Tokyo Station is large, often crowded, and it's actually quite easy to get lost there.I stayed in a Superior Room, which is the simplest room type at the hotel. The room was quite nice and facing the main street, the interior almost impeccable. A few small downside points regarding the room:- lighting felt a bit inadeqaute when dark outside (which is rather common at hotels nowadays, often due to the use of low energy lamps), you couldn't get it really bright if you wanted to- although 42"" TV, the TV set felt slightly outdated, and the channels offered were rather poor. One of the channels had good enough films on during Friday to Saturday at least- there was a dock for my iPhone, however this was connected to the TV speakers, which made for a rather poor sound experience. So a nice thought, but not very well implemented. The cost of a pair of decent speakers would have been a worthwhile investment.Otherwise, the room was very nice, the street view too, a good working desk, an internet connection for 2k jpy per 24 hrs that worked adequately (only used it by wifi), nice reading chair, quite nice bed, very nice bathroom and toiletries, etc.I used the gym once, quite nice, adequately equipped and with a very nice view. You get a locker key at the desk at floor 7, and you've got everything you need, so you only need to bring your workout clothes there. I didn't have the time to use the onsen (a real onsen btw, with spring water, onsen water is actually provided to hotels in Tokyo).However, what really sets this hotel apart is the service. Only one hickup when it comes to the staff - they were not 100% up-to-date with which rate should apply to my booking. This didn't present much of a problem though, and as a traveler one always need to look after this aspect as a general part of managing the trip, so no big deal. They immediately adjusted the rate, and that was it. On another note - I had one sleep-out night, which was no problem at all, I got to keep my room, as well as the rate (every third night on the house).Just a few words on the Ekki Restaurant before I go on with the staff in general. I have read a lot of reviews mentioning that the restaturant is very expensive. For one...if this is an issue, there are lots of other restaurants not far away. Also, the restuarant has combined menues (at least for those who stay at the hotel) which provide for 3 or 4 course dinners at a much lower rate. And what's more - the cuisine is quite good. I had one 4 course dinner, and was very satisfied, especially the grilled fish that actually made me chuckle between the bites, it was sooo good!! I was also very impressed with their timing and high degree of attentiveness. Everything arrived on precise time, and the waiter immediately noticed if something needed to be done. The meal and the service taken together made it all quite worth it for me.The hotel staff was very service minded, kind and thoughtful, and competent! They would always go beyond my expectations. When I asked the Concierge to book tickets on the bullet train (Shinkansen) for instance, they would come up with a better route than the one that I had found. They would also escort me to the train, at no cost, and ask if I needed somebody to meet me when returning. When I asked the Concierge to book a table at a restaurant with a short notice, the staff at ground floor printed out a map for me, plus made a note with a detailed yet easy to understand description of how to get there, including where to change trains and expected duration for each stretch of the trip (also finding a better way than the one I had initially thought of myself). This was ready when I arrived at ground floor on my way out. The day I left, one of the staff members escorted me to the Narita Express (taking care of my luggage as well), and we arrived rather early, some 25 minutes before the train was supposed to leave. Without hesitation the staff member offered me the opportunity to go shopping or whatever until departure time. As I didn't have any need to do any such thing, I said thanks, but no thanks. I was then asked whether I needed assistance to get the luggage onto the train - which I obviously didn't - i e the person was offering to stay around for another 20 minutes just to carry my bags on board. I kindly declined. But this is the kind of service they provide. This goes on and on. When it comes to these things, I am not easily impressed, but this staff did impress me over and over again. They were very good at spotting my needs, including to see if they could come up with something better than what I was actually asking for. I have never experienced anything close to this before.If it hasn't dawned on you yet - if you choose to stay at this hotel, do use the Concierge service, they will do the work for you, and faster and better than you ever could, while you do something more interesting or entertaining. I can't emphasise enough the value of this service.I give my very best recommendations for this hotel to anyone who values a high degree of service, and nice accomodation.","Stockholm, Sweden","jaytripping</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",11,5.0

The hotel offers a greeting service at Narita which we took advantage of. My girlfriend and I arrived on separate flights and terminals, we were both meet by separate hotel employees who expertly coordinated our meeting on the train. We were then met at Tokyo station by a young lady half my size who insisted on expertly carting our luggage through the crowds at Tokyo station....it was a very short walk to the hotel and we were quickly taken to our suite on the 7th floor, where we checked in our room. The suite consisted of 2 separate rooms, a living room, with work desk mini bar etc, a large bedroom and a separate bath with tub and walk in shower. All very nice, modern japanese style, The room has wi-fi, ipod players and flat screen television in every room. The bed was very comfortable, and dispite the room overlooking Tokyo station, fairly quiet, although you could hear the trains a bit, but not enough to disturb you. We used room service quite often for breakfast or a late night snack, pretty good selection of western and japanese styles, room service was prompt and friendly. The hotel has one restaurant, which I had breakfast in one morning, it was very good. but we didnt have dinner there. The gym is small but functional.

The location is fabulous. Right in the heart of Tokyo, minutes walk from Ginza and the Imperial Palace. It is literally attached to Tokyo station, so you can get almost anywhere in the country very quickly. Kyoto, for example, would be only about 2 hours by bullet train. Nagoya about the same. Narita airport is only about 40 minutes. We took our daughter to Disney and it was only 15 minutes from the hotel (by train). So, this hotel really has our vote for best location.The hotel itself is very intimate. Everyone knows your name, and the staff cannot do enough to help. The rooms are very spacious (we had a corner premier room and it felt like an apartment). We were also amazed at how clean and quiet our room was. It is hard to imagine a hotel in the heart of downtown Tokyo where one could feel more private and more comfortable. The hotel even has onsen (hot spring) baths. So, every morning, I would jog around the palace and return for a nice soak---it was really the life.My only nitpick is that the food is really expensive (as is the norm in Tokyo hotels). A burger from room service would run like 40 dollars. Since we were not traveling on business, we did not partake of the hotel's food (although I am sure it is quite good). Nonetheless, because of the hotel's location, there are many incredible food options in the immediate area. There are literally hundreds of restaurants right outside the door, so we didn't think twice about not be able to eat in the hotel.This hotel carries my highest recommendation. However, the rates fluctuate tremendously.

Weeks before our arrival the hotel had already exceeded our expectations and made our trip to Japan so incredibly easy and the perfect short holiday.

The concierge staff were exceptional... no other hotel even comes close. On arrival at Tokyo station from Narita Airport a staff member met us at the platform and piled our luggage onto a trolley. The suitcase stack was taller than her but she insisted on pushing it through the huge station. We were so glad she had met us as we feared if she hadn't we would have been lost in the station for at least four days - it is gigantic and a bit of a maze - accept the hotel's offer to be collected.The hotel has a boutique feel with only 57 rooms. Our room was spacious with a lovely bathroom, wonderful black floor boards to give it a modern Japanese feel and modern decor. The toilets were of course amazing with lots of buttons...

We usually stayed in Shibuya where we could shop till late hours. This time, we also visited Osaka, and we took the Nozumi (bullet train) to Tokyo. Since we're only staying in Tokyo for 3 nts., with the extended stay promotion, FS (with free roll-away bed) was only a slight premium to our regular hotel (our 3-bed-room has always been of premium price).I must say on arrival, I wasn't very impressed. (1) FS's platform greeting service was great. However, maybe we have not specified we had a lot of luggages (4 big & 2 small), Concierge did not come with a luggage cart, and we ended up having to carry our luggages to the Hotel, which was a few blocks away. (2) We arrived at 12:30 p.m., and our room was not ready. We had to leave our luggage there, and check-in in the evening after our visit to Harajuku. (3) No free internet, but the Hotel allows you to use their Business Centre for free.Check-in was smooth, and our room was great. We requested wii for our teenager son, and it was already inside the room with a lot of games and complimentary Japanese snacks. Needless to say, our son was very impressed. The Hotel also has X-Box and PS3. My son changed from wii to PS3 the following evening after he got bored with the wii games.The room, as well as the bathroom, was spacious and comfortable. Even the roll-away bed was the most comfortable ever.The Hotel is at a very convenient location. We usually took metro from the Kyobashi station, which was the closest to the Hotel, and the most convenient line to places like Ginza, Shibuya, and Asakusa. It is also quite close to Tsukiji Fish Market. We regreted not taking Concierge's advice to take a taxi there (about 1,000 yen?). We arrived at 7:20 a.m., but had to wait for 2 hr 40 min. Should we arrive earlier by taxi, maybe we did not have to wait for so long. However, the sushi was so fresh and delicious it's well worth the wait - the Ultimate Tsukiji experience!Since we have a lot of luggages, the Front Receptionist advised us to take the Airport Lumousine, which was closer to the Hotel, and stopped right in front of Departure Lvl., instead of Narita Express, which was on a different lvl. We were escorted to the Bus Terminal, and this time, we did not have to carry our luggages.Overall, we had an enjoyable stay. It's very difficult for us to choose between our regular hotel in Shibuya, which offers all the shopping convenience VS FS, which has the luxurious comfort and services, and proximity to the Tsukiji Fish Market.","West Vancouver, Canada","Lraep</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Vancouver, Canada</strong>",241,5.0

The professionalism is felt from the top, and was evidenced by the GM who was quite natural in bringing us our lunch in the lounge and never made mention of his role (obviously was helping because of a sudden rush to the main dinning room that took our servers attention for a few minutes).

Simply put, we had a first class experience, just as one would expect from the Four Seasons.As it was our first visit to Japan, we used the hotel ""meet and greet"" service. It was exactly as promised (recurring theme during our stay). A very pleasnat lady was waiting outside of arrivals for us, arranged our transportation into Tokyo (Narita Express) and walked us to the train car. When we arrived at Tokyo Station, a member of the Concierge staff was waiting for us on the train platform and walked us to the hotel. Watching her steer our 2 suitcases through the bustle of Tokyo Station during evening rush hour was truly impressive. We were glad we arranged this service, although signage is in both Japanese and English, we would never have found our way out of the Station !The hotel occupies part of the first 7 floors of an office building adjacent to the train station. Decor is not overtly Japanese, and most of the local feel is achieved via artwork. The room itself was quite comfortable, very spacious and all fixtures, amenities etc were of exceptional quality. Our room faced the street, but soundproffing was excellent. Due to allergies, we requested a non-feather room, and that is exactly what we had. Having made this reequest numerous times over the years, this property was one of the VERY few that actually fulfilled the request.One quick note about concierge service. We traded emails back and forth with the concierge before our visit, asking for advice and questions on various topics. As you would expect, theyhandled all requests with efficiency and courtesy. We had seen signs advertising the play ""Wicked"" in the Shio-dome area, and one morning I asked the Concierge if he could provide me with details (time, location, etc). Although he clearly was not familiar with the play, he (via the magic of Internet) determined that there was no performance that particular day. [Why anyone would spend 3 hours in Tokyo seeing a play they had seen before is another story....]. We then had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and during the meal, the Concierge came up, apologized for interrupting, and let me know he was wrong earlier and there was in fact a performace that day at 1 pm. Since we were planning on shopping in the Ginza, we did not go see the play, but we were impressed by his work ethic and desire to satisfy customers.My wife had a massage in the Spa and was very satisfied. The masseuse did not merely go through the motions, and was quite willing to work extra on those pesky problem muscles.TIP: the hotel itself is in a great location. Being a short walk away from Tokyo Station makes anywhere in Tokyo easily accessible by train/subway. Tokyo Station however is quite busy, and we found that the Kyobashi Station on the Ginza line was just as close to the hotel and was very lightly used. Unless it makes your destination difficult to get to, I would recommend using Kyobashi instead of Tokyo. If you want to use the Ginza line (Ginza, Shibuya, Ueno) this Station gives you a direct, no connection, route.The hotel restaurant was excellent, all food was prepared exactly as requested and made with the finest quality ingredients. Undoubtedly some of the reviews (which I have not read) will be critical of pricing, but, frankly, the Four Seasons is a first class hotel and the prices reflect this. IIf you want more economical options, there are many, many choices in both the Underground shopping malls and the surrounding areas.Overall, we really enjoyed our 3 nights. Service, accomodations, and location were all of the highest order. If the Four Seasons fits into your price range, you cannot go wrong.","Bowling Green, KY","Hunter747</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bowling Green, KY</strong>",79,5.0

It was our first time in Japan and we were all a bit nervous about how we were going to function in a city where we not only didn't know the language, but we also had read that there were very few English street signs or maps, and that very few people spoke English. Well, our worries were unfounded. We were actually picked up at Narita airport by an FS employee called a ""greeter""; a very capable lady who helped us organize our train tickets into Tokyo's main station. (Note: hiring a taxi or a private care to take you into town or to your hotel is very, very expensive. I normally don't cringe at high prices for private cars but....$900?!?! - or thereabouts?!?)The train ride was fabulous, even though we were tired. Each stop was announced in different languages including English, so we need not have worried. At the main station there was an FS employee waiting directly outside our car (everything is so well organized, it is possible for the train cars to stop in the same place every time, which is well marked on the floors of the stations). He then piled our luggage on a trolley and walked us patiently and gently through the throngs of people at the station all the way to the hotel which is next door - although you wouldn't know it because it is kind of hidden. It was a good thing he was there for us - I probably would not have found it alone. Once you are inside, everythng is an oasis of calm and order. The hotel is one of the smallest in the FS chain, only about 7 floors in total. In the traditional way of Japan, attention is paid to the slightest little detail in order to ensure perfection. Whether of beauty or technology - everything worked so well that I found myself wondering why nothing outside of Japan was so lovely, or worked so seamlessly well.Our room was amazing; it was modern, yet warm. It had a really neat sliding door that shut the sitting room off from the bedroom, and it had an awesome bathroom. And of course the super famous Japanese Toto toilets. The bathtub was gorgeous, a creamy egg shape, but I confess I found it really difficult to relax in because I kept slipping down inside it!The food was fantastic, whether Asian, Japanese or Western. The atmosphere was super-cool. All the most happening people must go there for drinks or meetings - the vibe was perfect.Room service was perfect - even a hot chocolate and cookies were presented in a faultless way. The concierge gets a special virtual hug from me for organizing who must be quite simply the best tour guide for her country ever. Miss Izumi, we all enjoyed the time you spent with us. I would recommend her services to everyone staying in Tokyo. She took us everywhere by foot, train, monorail and subway - and we saw a lot. I didn't get a chance to use the spa but I got a quick tour and it looks scrumptious - even the onsen bath looked really nice, not frightening at all for a Western visitor.We also organized tickets to Kyoto on the bullet train with the concierge, and tickets to an FC Tokyo football match. Everything went fantastically, and we are definitely coming back. BTW, the view of Mt. Fuji out the window of the bullet train to Kyoto is so incredible, if you are lucky enough to have the weather on your side to see it.Run don't walk to Tokyo - and stay here if you can afford it - it's GREAT!!","Kusnacht, Switzerland","heavycat69</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kusnacht, Switzerland</strong>",192,5.0

We used the meet and greet service - couldn't be easier after 16 hours of flying. FS staff member picked us up from the bus station at Tokyo Station (but left earlier than the Narita express so was more convenient) and walked us to the hotel (5 minutes or less). Check in was in the room - and an info pack containing all my restaurant reservations, shikansen tickets to Kyoto, and maps to our Ryokan there were already prepared. Everything I requested was done to perfection.We stayed in an executive suite - which is huge (2 bathrooms) and very well laid out - in a contemporary style. Beds are super comfy. WiFi and lan access are available ($20 a day) and work well. Room service breakfast was very good and showed up within 15 minutes. The room has a nespresso coffee maker as well as a french press coffee maker (excellent idea to have both!). The room had views of the trains (including the Shikansen) passing by our window (without any noise though) - which was a nice touch.When we left to Kyoto a staff member accompanied us to the train, going so fare as to help us get settled - can't beat that kind of service!All in all, you couldn't ask for more and in the competitive luxury Tokyo hotel market - the Four Seasons Marunouchi more than excels. Though there are many other good choices in Tokyo - this hotel will appeal to guests who want very personal service (with only 50 guest rooms it's an intimate a very personal experience); care for the location (very good for business and transportation - slightly less so for sightseeing); and expect the highest level of service. I also felt I got very good value for my money.","New York City, New York","Erik567</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",183,5.0

It was FABULOUS! First of all, they will send a Mercedes to the airport for you if you are willing to pay the $$$. This is nice if you are not familiar with Tokyo and you're jet lagged. It's a very safe place so a taxi would probably be fine, but the car is nice! The hotel has a wonderful check in system. They take you directly to your room and check you in there. No hanging in a lobby after flying for 14 hours!!! The rooms are beautiful, very modern and high end with heated floors, flat screen tv's and glass walls facing the street. Breakfast is excellent, both in the restaurant and brought to the room. The information desk is very helpful. They will get any information you might need, and will write down destination information in Japanese for you to use with cab drivers. One of the best things about the hotel is how close it is to the main train station. It is literally right next door and a hotel escort will take you to the train station and put you right on the train. They will also greet you when you return and walk you back to the hotel ( pretty confusing in the terminal...). We took the train to Nagoya and saw the 'Snow Monkeys' and to Kyoto to see the Geishas. otherwise we took a lot of taxis.The Ginza is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel and is fabulous. The shopping is amazing as are the tempura restaurants. On Sundays, they close the main street and it is full of people. You can get to the Hyatt, Harajuku district, Shinjuku etc, by train or taxi.

You never have to ask thing twice. Just one exemple. We had dinner at the hotel and wanted a table in front of the windows. We had the table and they gave me at the end of the dinner an ashtree. Then we made another reservation for the end of the week; we had the same table; they remember where I sat and next to my plate they had placed an ashtree; plus they remembered I cannot eat onions and when I asked ""without onions"" they told me everything was planned without.

Obviously it is an expensive hotel (and with the pound sliding against the yen whilst we were there this became increasingly clear...) but I really do feel that you get your money's worth.As this was our first time in Japan we booked the 'meet and greet' service offered by the hotel (which you pay for). This meant that we were met at the airport by a member of staff from the hotel who sorted out our bus tickets (we'd just missed the Narita Express), took us to the correct bus stop, helped with luggage, and generally made us feel very welcome after a long flight from London. She then phoned ahead to let the hotel know that we were on the bus, and someone came to meet us at the bus stop and escorted us to the hotel. We were immediately taken up to our room (a Premier King) to check-in, which again was great after a long journey. Our room was on the third floor with a lovely view across a leafy patio area and then across to Tokyo Station. If you're into that sort of thing it could be train-spotter heaven!Our room was huge with floor to ceiling windows on one side, the largest bed I think I've ever seen (it made a UK king seem tiny) and a great bathroom. This was also the first time I'd experienced a Japanese toilet, and being British it was a bit odd at first but by the end of the week I was a definite convert.The bar and restaurant (up on the 7th floor along with the spa) were great, serving some of the best cocktails I've ever had - unlike the bar in the Park Hyatt hotel where their vodka martinis tasted as if they'd been watered down.... Whilst we ate lunch and dinner elsewhere we always had breakfast in the hotel, where they did possibly the best scrambled eggs with hash browns that I've ever tasted.Finally the staff - what can I say? The other reviews here are testimony to the fact that the Four Seasons train their staff extremely well - better than any other hotel chain I can think of. You are genuinely made to feel that the hotel exists only for you - an absolute joy.I know this sounds like a gushing review, and I've honestly tried to think about some negative points to make. But all I can really comment on is the price, and as I said at the beginning I think the expense is well worth it. I hope to return soon, so I guess we'd better start saving....","St. Albans, United Kingdom","IdyllicTraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Albans, United Kingdom</strong>",13,5.0

It’s strategically located adjacent to the Tokyo station ( the transport hub of Tokyo ) and is directly accessible by Narita Express and only a short walk away from Ginza. This is actually only the second Four Seasons that I have stayed.ArrivingI arrived by Narita Express and choose to use the “Meet and Greet” service of the hotel so that I don’t have to go thru the hassle of figuring my own way to the hotel. Things went efficiently as expected of a Four Seasons. On arriving, I was escorted to my room for in-room check. All as per expectation. Also pleasing is that the hotel has granted my request for early check-in. I arrived at 9:30AM. The RoomOK, this is a 5-star hotel no doubt and the room does reflect that. However, while it might have been cutting edge when it opened many years ago, now it’s getting long in the tooth especially compared to the newer hotels. Put plainly, this room doesn’t “ooze” luxury for the hotels of the same class. Perhaps I’m being too demanding as I have seen the very best the hotel industry has to offer. The room is basically “what you get is what you see”, ie the pictures on the website quite accurately reflect the room. I booked a “Premier Room” which is the upper tier room type in this hotel. The room measures a spacious 50+ m2 and divided into a foyer, a closet area, a bathroom, a living area and a sleeping quarters. It’s in a contemporary style but seems to be lacking some “wow” factor compared to the newer hotels like the Peninsula Tokyo. The bathroom is adequate with all the necessary stuff like advance toilet, good water pressure, deep soaking tub but otherwise is small and seems to be an after thought when designing the room. A couple using the bathroom in the morning will likely complain about the lack of space. Among some of the short comings are :-1. Small bathroom, not a full ensuite. Only one sink. 2. No LCD TV in the bathroom. In this day and age, this is almost a must. 3. No rainforest shower. Old fashion bathroom fittings in shower cubicle. 4. There is only one plasma TV facing the bed and if you choose to sit on the sofa, it’s position such that you can’t watch the TV at the same time. Putting up another TV or using a rotating cabinet would be helpful5. There’s no wireless internet in the room or at least I couldn’t find it. 6. Very small electronic safe. Can hardly put anything larger than a passport.  7. Bed is run-of-the-mill, not as comfortable as the best I have slept in. 8. Lack of power plugs on the desk ( only one! ). I need to request an extension from housekeeping, then adapters. Given the spacious work desk, why don’t they incorporate more plugs into the wall?9. View facing train station and Tokyo Forum wasn’t very impressiveThere are some good points though. The room is very quiet, evident by the triple glazing employed. Some good gadgets including iPod dock ( with remote ), a Bose CD/Alarm clock ( but with awful sound ), plasma TV etc. Common AreasThis hotel is really small. It’s inside a office tower. If you don’t pay attention, you can easily miss the entrance. There’s only one restaurant which also function as a bar and a lounge and the prices are astronomically expensive ( USD40++ for a set breakfast with only standard items ). The lobby is very small, with the reception and concierge desk taking up most of the space. However, the common areas are tastefully decorated. Basically, it’s a very small hotel, really boutique in that sense. ServiceNothing to fault here though as a boutique hotel, service can be over-bearing at times. Everywhere I go, the staff seems to know who I am and greet me by name. They also rush to help with pressing the lift, carrying bags etc. Not that it’s a bad thing of course. Also as expected of a Four Seasons, the rooms are kept impeccably clean. To be very fair, I have to say the Four Seasons service level is so far the best I have seen in Tokyo and almost comparable to the Excellent Four Seasons Hong Kong. Value This hotel is incredibly expensive, commanding top tier rate among 5-star luxury hotels in Tokyo and therein lies the problem. I happened to book a weekend rate which is about Yen10,000 cheaper ( and that’s excluding breakfast and no benefits of any kind ). Yet, for the price, the room quality is obviously inferior even when compared to the newer Ritz Carlton, not to mention the far more extravagant Peninsula Tokyo. It’s almost embarrassingly inadequate. Really, a renovation is by now overdue if the Four Seasons Marunouchi intends to position itself as a premium luxury hotel. There’s also no amazing view to speak of too as the hotel is a low rise. The only area that the hotel delivers is in service, but then this is Tokyo, good service is almost always expected, plus or minus some.  ConclusionOverall, this hotel is “OK” but I’m not particularly impressed by it, especially the room quality. I did not have high expectations for this hotel in the beginning and just thought of trying something new. So I was quite pleased to have only tried out one night and happily moved over to the Peninsula the following day. I would say it’s a good choice if you want a 5-star hotel that’s near to Ginza and also appreciate to have the constant attention of the hotel staff. However, unless the room rates can be significantly lower or that the owners invested in renovation to enhance the room quality and amenities, I doubt I will return as the Peninsula is a substantially more attractive alternative.",JAKARTA,"BENLEE123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>JAKARTA</strong>",775,3.0

The hotel: Stunning! Comfortable beyond explanation. No toiletry was missing (which was most appreciated, since we had almost nothing in our hand luggage). The lobby is on the 7th floor and affords excellent views.

We were whisked away to a Ginza dept. store; the driver waited patiently in front... we were astounded at this level of service! Not only did each member of the staff graciously accommodate our requests, they diligently chased up our luggage (communicating regularly with the airport) to ensure that everything arrived as soon as possible (we had to take a Shinkasen to Osaka the evening after our arrival). We can't thank everyone enough for taking such good care of us after a long flight, in our exhausted state.Admittedly, we were a bit rushed and could not enjoy the hotel facilities (restaurant, gym) as we wished, but the room was luxurious - and the large bathtub (complete with aromatic bath salts) was divine.

The standard room was very nice, if a little small, with a windowless large bathroom. We have also stayed in one bedroom suites with a city view and a view of the station. The suites were large and exquisite with some unique features. While the station view is gorgeous, it is a little noisy. Business travellers and sensitive sleepers are probably best to ask for a city view room.The hotel is very well located. Tokyo Station, Ginza, the Imperial Palace and the Forum are within walking distance. All the sites are easily accessible by train which makes the proximity to Tokyo Station desirable (unlike the Park Hyatt which is 10 minute drive from the the closest station).The in-room electronics and amenities are excellent. LIke many other Four Seasons, the hotel provides L'Occitane bathproducts but also provides Kniepp bath salts and pillows. Yukatas and pj's can also be found in the room (in addition to the usual bathrobe) which adds a unique Japanese touch. A variety of pillows are available upon request. HIgh quality Japanese green tea and coffee are available in the room (along with china, an electric tea kettle and a french press).The hotel is very small (57 rooms). The entire staff greets you by name. The staff also notes preferences and ensures they are observed on follow-up visits. For example, we once requested an iron and on subsequent visits an iron has been placed in our room. The hotel is generally very quiet which makes it an excellent hotel for business travel.The spa is small but the onsen and gym are wonderful.The food is very expensive, even by Tokyo and Four Seasons standards. For example, a soft drink is 1000 yen. The same soft drink is available at the nearby convenience store for 140 yen. The price of the food seemed quite excessive. The cost of in-room movies was also very high (2000 yen).The concierge service was a bit mixed but generally excellent. In some respects they are very organized and go out of thier way to be helpful. On one visit, we had a Japan Rail Pass and planned to travel the country. The hotel sent a staff member to get tickets for every leg of our trip at no cost. As we were taking a small bag on our trip, they allowed us to store our luggage while touring the country and pick it up before leaving Tokyo (at no cost). This was very helpful to us and we appreciated the hotel did not charge us for these services. As well, print-outs are available for all major sites that provide a description of the site, colour pictures and a map. The concierge is also very good about making reservations, getting good tables etc... but they don't always check pertinent information before giving advice. For example, on two occassions we were told a tourist site was open and on both occasions the sites were closed (one was a regular closing and the other owing to a national holiday). I would advise people to ask the concierge to verify if the particular destination is open at the time they would like to visit. On the whole, we were very pleased with the hotel and returned after our first visit.

The in room internet service was annoying, as it was hard to maneuver the mouse and took a long time to load. The maid service was constant and one walked in on me while I was in a state of undress. The spa is just a couple of uninviting rooms with no amenities, although the massage was divine. The hotel is located on a couple of floors in a high rise building and does not have many rooms. Asking for directions and recommendations for dining was not easy. They kept sending us to restaurants designed for tourists. It is very expensive and very exclusive. It is unique considering that it is in a huge building yet retains a feeling of intimacy and beauty. The doorman always greeted me by name with a bow. They provide free pastries and coffee in the lobby in the early am (4-6) which is great if you are heading out to the fish market and need a wake up coffee. It is something to experience at least once in a lifetime. I was equally pleased with the Mandarin Oriental which was half the price and liked the rooms and spa better; although the personal service was not at the same level. You will feel like royalty while at the Four Seasons and may possibly become too accustomed to privilege for your own good.

Ours was a standard room on the 3rd floor. Check-in was effortless. The room was huge and gorgeous. It was also very quiet despite facing a major street. The bathroom was very large--larger than our bathroom at the Shinjuku Park Hyatt, but unlike our room at the Hyatt, there was no window in the bathroom. It was hardly a big deal, though, considering how luxurious it was. We had dinner at the Ekki Bar and Grill one night. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the atmosphere was quiet and elegant. The service was not quick but well-paced to allow us to linger over wine and to chat. The food was first class.We had a few problems with the service, though. One morning the waiter forgot to put in our breakfast order so we had to wait over 45 minutes after ordering to get our food. There were only about 5 other tables at the time, so it was hardly busy. The next morning, the wait staff apologized. The servings of the 'breakfast entrees' were far too large, but the food was delicious. Everything was fresh and beautifully presented. The next morning the waitress forgot my coffee and I didn't get it until I was almost finished eating, despite asking for it twice. Also, housekeeping took my nightshirt -- the only thing I had brought to sleep in -- out with the linens when they changed the room. The shirt was returned the next day with a card from the housekeeping manager containing an apology along with some chocolates. The front desk staff, though, were knowledgable, friendly, and very professional.The location is hard to beat. It's within easy walking distance of three metro stops, Ginza, the Marunouchi Building, and the Imperial Palace.","Okinawa, Japan","Hikari</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Okinawa, Japan</strong>",61,4.0

The hotel is very stylish -above all the lobbies and the Spa- rooms are modern and spacious, with very comfortable bathroom (with shower and tub). Our room (#501) had a very nice view of the conference center. The room amenities are very complete (included pyjamas and gowns replaced daily). What I appreciated most in the Hotel was the amazing courtesy, kindness, punctuality and availability of the hotel staff (...really ""beyond compare""), probably the best hotel service I ever experienced. If compared with the Park Hyatt where I stayed later, the four seasons is probably more elegant, and it is definitely in a better neighborhood (but more expensive too).

But this hotel is really exceptional and we all loved it. The rooms (and we had two) are magnificently equipped and furnished in a modern, sleek style. I have never seen so many useful little items in a hotel room: pajamas, hairbrush, rubber bands for hair, oil blotting papers for the face, toothbrush and paste, beautiful pens. The bathroom toiletries were all in a very substantial size too, instead of the tiny little bottles you usually get. The beds were sublimely comfortable. We loved the room.Other nice features of the hotel are a fabulously equipped gym, and free internet access for guests. Granted, there is only one computer available for use, but we never found getting online to be a problem. The location of the hotel is great. It's an easy walk to the Ginza for shopping, and the hotel is right next to Tokyo Station. In fact, many of the rooms at the hotel have a view of the bullet trains as they go in and out of Tokyo Station. We loved watching the trains - but our room was not overlooking them too closely...We had breakfast included with our rooms. The restaurant is really beautifully decorated, and is a relaxing place to dine. We didn't find the breakfast menu to be too inspiring, however. We coudn't really find anything that we enjoyed eating. The American breakfast was sub-standard - bacon and sausage were not tasty, and the eggs so-so. One day my son ordered waffles, and it consisted of one tiny waffle cut in half...We are not huge eaters, but the portions were quite small. The lattes were tasty, but quite weak. So, while we usually enjoy breakfast in our hotel, this was definitely not one of our favorites.Generally, we were very pleased with the service. The staff could not have been friendlier or more gracious. We did have a small problem with the concierge. They booked tickets for us on the bullet train to Kyoto. We were told the tickets would cost about $400 - but the concierge didn't mention that this was EACH WAY. So, it was a bit of a surprise when we finally got the bill for $800.

Then when we asked for extra blankets and pillows, the hotel wanted to charge us $50/pers extra (for my friend and her son) on top of the rate they were already charging us for the suite.

Travelled with 4 children plus babysitter. Rooms very big for Tokyo with nice views (we were on the 4th floor -- corner room in particular is very nice) -- we had a connecting room with huge full size bed in one room; twins plus crib in the other. But the rave is about the service. Our minibus from the airport was greeted by several staff with our check-in folio in hand, everyone knew our name every time we came in or out of the hotel, bellmen (and women) were instantaneous, courteous, friendly; same with front desk and restaurant. When we arrived at the room, there were robes in sizes for each person (including kids) and cookies and marshmallows with their names waiting on the counter. Only negative are the prices in the restaurant (hotel has only one restaurant, and juice is $12.00 for a modest glass-- don't let the kids order refills! - an American breakfast around $30.00). As an alternative check out the trainstation across the street. There are lots of nice bakeries, japanese restaurants, and even a mcdonald's and a starbucks for those feeling homesick. The stairs down are probably 100 feet from the hotel entrance. The location is superb not just because of the trainstation, but because the Ginza district is very close by and there is lots of great shopping, department stores, cafes (outdoor and indoor) and sights within a short distance.

We received excellent service from the whole staff - bellboys to the coincerge - and only wish there was more time to lounge about Tokyo so that we could have enjoyed the experience even longer. On our last day, the hotel booked the train tickets to Narita Airport and had one of their staff take our bags directly to the platform for depature.

However, the service and accomodations are anything but non-descript.   An extremely gracious staff member who spoke perfect english met us right in our train car as it came to a stop in Tokyo station. He escorted us quickly up out of the station and over to a waiting car. Although the hotel is within walking distance, and they normally walk guests over, he saw that my wife was pregnant and quickly called ahead for a car to meet us. Once inside the hotel, we were greeted by another extremely gracious staff member who lead us immediately up to a beautiful and spacious room on the 5th floor with an enormous glass wall overlooking the street scene below. He quickly showed us the room, took care of a few details, and then got out of our hair after giving us his personal business card in case we needed anything at all. The room felt very large and was very tastefully decorated, the king bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in. We remarked that *this* is what Westin's ""heavenly bed"" should be like. The eligant granite and brass bathroom was huge, and had gorgeous frosted glass walls seperating the toilet, shower, and closet areas. The walls of the rooms in the hotel have obviously been sound proofed, as the room was absolutely dead silent. We never heard a peep from anything outside our room. On our return to Tokyo a week later, we stayed again at the Four Seasons. We were met this time by the same staff member at the door, who did away completely with the check in procedure and led us up to a new room, as they had upgraded us this time to a suite. The suite had a seperate bedroom and living room which made it feel not quite as spacious as the first room we'd staying in, however it was just as lovely and had a second toilet room by the door, which could useful in a business situation. This room was on the side of the building, which as another reviewer noted, meant you could here the trains going past. However, it was extremely muted and I found it actually pleasant to listen to. Unless you've got a specific issue with trains, I can't see how it would bother anybody. The next morning we departed Tokyo, and the concierge had purchased our train tickets for us, we were again led to our train where the porter waited with us for twenty minutes and helped load our bags onto the train, and then again met at our train as it arrived at the airport and taken to the check in counter.
