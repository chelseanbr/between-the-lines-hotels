The elevator was really slow, we took the stairs most of the time (10th floor). The hotel is at a very good location, near Waikiki and there are many restaurants and shops around. Staff is kind and helpful. We felt scammed with our bill because it didn't match the price stated in our booking... They charge you one extra night, but don't worry it's just 160 dollars! We were not told we had to pay to use the parking either. However, we did know we had to pay a daily ammenity fee, I still wonder what ammenities we paid for... I hope it wasn't for the use of the swimming pool which was really small and we didn't use. We had other options to stay at and if we had known all these aspects we wouldn't have chosen Aqua Palms.

There is so many accommodation options to chose from in Waikiki but this little gem will have us coming back to stay every time! It may not be the most newest looking accommodation but it certainly isn’t the oldest; we didn’t come to Hawaii to look at the walls. The hotel is a quick walk to the beach, Main Street and Ala Moana shopping centre. The beds were very comfy and spacious for our family of 4. The shuttle service to the shopping centre was very welcomed and ihop next to the entrance was a great spot to eat. The managers drinks and nibbles on Wednesday afternoons with beautiful live music was such a treat that I’m not sure a bigger or fancier hotel would be able to capture the intimacy of such an event that made us feel part of the family. The highlight of our stay here was the concierge Charla! Charla helped us book activities for the duration of our stay and really catered to our families needs! Her friendliness, expert knowledge and professionalism is an asset to the Expedia group. Thanks to Charla our family will have lifelong and enriching memories of our time spent in Hawaii and I cant recommend her services highly enough for anyone needing help with their holiday planning too!

I turned the AC off at night, which helped, but street noise was something I couldn't do anything about, I was on a lower floor in a room over looking Ala Moana Blvd., so those staying on the other side of the hall or higher up might not have been as impacted by noise as I was.

Overall the facility is well maintained and we were very comfortable whether in the lobby, our hotel room or traversing the hallways. This hotel is clearly ""old Hawaii"" but nothing felt broken, overly worn out or so outdated that it was distracting. In fact I was very please with the look and feel of the spaces we were in during our stay. The location is great! No, it's not right on the beach but you get a great value and you're just across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village with all the touristy shops, eats and beach. One of the highlights was the friendly and helpful staff. We were well taken care of and always had quick answers to questions. They have beach towels and chairs that you can checkout with no charge so it makes a day at the beach simple and care free.The one thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is that in some places around the edges you could see some significant damage from usage. An example of this is all the elevator door frames and even the wall in the lobby elevator hallways had many scuff marks and even gouges. The interior of the elevators themselves were updated but really ugly.

We settled on this place because of a combination of pricing and availability, ultimately paying nearly $1200 for three nights of lodging. Resort fees, taxes and surcharges for wifi are NOT included in the listed price... beware!The location is desirable; walking distance to the beach and to most other Waikiki resorts. The lobby is staffed with an onsite tour planner who can quickly book sightseeing and day trips. The staff is friendly and polite. The fact that we found them to be consistently overwhelmed - and thus unable to attend to our various needs in a timely manner - was probably no fault of the staff with whom we interacted. Mismanagement of Holiday demands seems to be the culprit here. Check-in was hectic and delayed owing to a crowded reception area and long lines. We were forced to stand in line twice because no rooms were ready for us by 2 PM when we arrived from the airport. The first time, I filled out paperwork and signed for the room. The second time, after we had taken lunch while waiting for the room to be prepped, we had to stand in line again in order to get the room key. 30 minutes into our official stay, while attempting to enjoy a private moment, my wife and I were interrupted by housekeeping. No knock was heard; they simply opened the door and began to enter the hallway before quickly turning back. Both staff members seemed apologetic when I dressed myself in a towel and ducked outside the room to confront them. Their explanation was that they were checking to see whether or not the room was yet occupied. Communication between reception and housekeeping/service seems to be poor. Another example of this was the following afternoon, when we attempted to use the safe to store our computers. Upon finding that it was malfunctioning, we called for assistance. We were told to expect assistance in 5-10 minutes. After waiting 15 minutes, we left for our tour and spent the afternoon preoccupied with the fact that both of our laptops and other valuables were unsecured. Nothing was missing upon our return, but that is not the point.Everything about this place feels small and cramped. The lobby is small and very easily gets crowded. The elevator platform is in a tiny halfway, where it is nearly impossible for parties with luggage - simultaneously checking in and checking out - to move past each other. The room was tiny, but everything functioned properly except for the safe. The pool/deck area is tiny, busy and crowded. A barbecue area in the corner is sufficient for one medium-sized party or family at a time. The pool itself is more of an L-shaped in-ground tub. It was fully commandeered by 5-6 unsupervised kids entering, exiting, and chasing and splashing each other. Most available deck furniture was not out of splash range. The view from our balcony was away from the ocean, even though we payed an ocean-view rate. Our window faced the mountains and other resort/condominium towers. If we avoided looking down, we could avoid seeing unsightly disposal & personal patio/storage areas associated with at least three residential structures. As of the second evening of our stay, nobody has followed up with us about our safe or touched base with us about yesterday's incident. We are looking forward to spending the rest of our week at another establishment at the other end of Waikiki.

First the good is on-site parking, nice somewhat updated rooms with comfortable beds, and close to Waikiki Beach and shopping. The biggest not-so good... the noise from Ala Moana Blvd, and the pool area, was relenting. So, if you are in an even numbered room giving you a filtered view of the water and Diamond Head, you will get the traffic and pool noise. Consider a room facing away from the street or bring ear plugs if noise bothers you. I tried to turn the fan to run continuously, but it would shut down to automatic after some time. Also not all rooms have balconies. I had room 708 with sliding balcony doors and a concrete pillar right in the middle. Rooms on either side of me had a nice sized furnished balcony with good access.There were a few other annoyances. The cold tap water is warm. There was a small pitcher in the mini-fridge to fill with water, to make cold tap water available. The shower water pressure is a fine mist at most. While the room received some furnishing updates, the night stands desk and lamps looked pretty beat up. The lamp shades were brown and cracked but did work. Outlets were at a minimum.

We had to get our stored things out of a storage facility and send them off island and needed a nearby 'staging' location. We live on Oahu. If this hotel had been priced cheaper, I would probably have given a 4 star rating, because the staff is friendly and helpful and it is well-located. However, at $140 a day, I would have expected more meticulous cleaning - the windows had previous-occupant kiss marks on the windows and the bathroom mirrors were not cleaned consistently. I have paid more in Waikiki and gotten more, so at this price, if I were coming to Hawaii for a vacation and expected to be out all day, paying more might not make sense. Expecting more at this price is the problem. I guess I had the same feeling I have when I get a coffee at a restaurant and there is lipstick already on the cup. Seems they're just not careful and maybe a little run down. I noted that the tub had been resurfaced and the surface was peeling (though the water pressure and temperature were amazing!), the coffee maker left a mildewy taste to the coffee, the microwave had dark stains that looked like mold (though I tried to clean it and it seemed embedded, not surface) and the beds sometimes looked like a kid had made them, e.g., with lumpy sheets under the blanket. A couple of nights I was awoken by loud noises from the room next door and somebody smoking pakalolo on the next-door lanai, but that isn't the hotel's fault, I guess.

We stayed a week at the Aqua Palms. Hotel staff responded quickly every time we called for help, whether it was extra towels or fixing something in the room. They fixed a slow running bath drain and a toilet issue both efficiently and completely to our satisfaction. They gave us a tutorial on how to use the room safe as there were no instructions and we couldn’t figure it out.  We had a free movie rental and couldn’t get it to play on the PlayStation in the room. Maintenance came and literally took the tv off the wall to get the wires hooked up correctly and working. Every single person on staff was warm, friendly and helpful. There was a basket of free apples in the lobby every day at the front desk. They had a dispenser on the wall by the front desk filled with free reef-friendly sunscreen. We rubbed some on every day and it worked great. We got the ‘free’ breakfast package. You get to eat at the IHOP next door or the coffee shop on the corner. Both provide basically the same choices for your breakfast. You select from a specific list of eggs, meat, carbs like toast, hash browns,pancakes, or French toast. Those are your only choices. I can’t eat a cooked breakfast every single day and would have loved to just have a bowl of Cheerios and fruit but that wasn’t allowed. I ended up buying some at the ABC convenience store around the corner and some milk for the room fridge and ate my breakfast in the room. On Sat morning when we needed to check out the dining options were so crowded we couldn’t use our free breakfast. So basically we wasted quite a few of our free breakfast certificates. Only choose the free breakfast option if you want a hot breakfast every day. Also you can only get coffee OR orange juice. Not both. WiFi was the best I have ever had in a hotel. Worked great. We used the beach chairs and beach towels several times and greatly appreciated that. We took the free shuttle to the mall/Walmart one day and it went smooth. Later in the week we wanted to head to Waikiki beach (it is a hike) so we waited for the shuttle. We could see where it was on their app. They say they run two shuttles but we never saw two. We knew the route they were going so we headed down to a nearby stop at the Ilikai hotel and waited for almost an hour for a shuttle bus to stop. We could see on the app map that the shuttle was finally getting to our stop and we were absolutely shocked when the shuttle drove right past the stop and didn’t even slow down!! We had just wasted an hour out in the blazing heat. We went back to the Aqua Palms and complained and the concierge lady explained to us how to take the trolley. After that we used the public bus and the trolley. Before our trip I had researched transportation because we didn’t want to rent a car every day and selected Aqua Palms due to its free shuttle and proximity to the bus and trolley stops. I am giving this only a 3 rating because the hotel contracts with this shuttle service and then has no way to satisfy the customer when the shuttle service only runs one shuttle a day or doesn’t even stop to pick up people. This supposedly is part of your $25 day amenity fee you pay in addition to your room rate so we surely did not get our money’s worth on that. They have a few washer and dryers in the hotel but they were always in use so we ended up walking down the block with a suitcase full of dirty clothes to a laundromat instead. We had a balcony room and a nice partial view of the ocean. It was right on the street and there is constant traffic and noise so not a pleasant balcony to just sit out and enjoy reading a book or watching the ocean. It stays busy til all hours of the morning. I slept with ear plugs in. The location is great. You can walk to many places and it is close to the Ilikai hotel where many tours pick people up. There is a outdoor shopping village across the street which was nice to stroll through, a couple ABC stores within walking distance, an Urgent Care around the corner, and a beach close by. We walked to several restaurants for dinner during our stay. It has an air conditioned lobby, which surprisingly not all hotels have there and that is such a wonderful welcome while waiting for a taxi or after a day outside in the humidity and heat. Both my husband and I slept well on the mattress and the air conditioning worked well in our room. The shower had really forceful water pressure which I enjoyed but if we had brought our son when he was younger he would have freaked out. Although it was always busy outside with traffic and pedestrians, the day we ventured down to Waikiki beach we encountered wall to wall people on the streets and the beach. So in comparison, this location was much easier to get around and the beach close by became our preferred beach. All the beaches on the island are public beaches so you don’t have to be staying at a hotel to use the beach outside their property.

Even after asking housekeeping to change the linen nothing happened. Yes the hotel does offer beach chairs, towels to take to the beach plus the complimentary shuttle to the local malls etc, however that does not compensate for their short comings. There is no eatery in the hotel you have to eat at the ihop, or other places around meaning no room service. Lucky they do provide microwaves, so you can buy from other places and heat it up later.

The hotel is just about 'okay', in some ways above and below that mark. The staff (other than housekeeping) was efficient, friendly, and had a good grasp of hospitality. The location is about a 10 minute walk from the Hawaiian Convention Center, and the beach. There are good dining and shopping options within walking distance. The room itself had a few issues. My wife noted almost immediately that there was a small (about a two inch smear) splash of dried blood on the dresser. We noted it, didn't use the dresser, and noticed that it was not found and cleaned during our three day stay. The sheets and towels were regularly replaced and cleaned, but that stain was pretty heinous. The king bed was on the firm side and and the pillows were just about average. There was no fan in the bathroom which is a really odd oversight in my opinion. The cable television had a decent range of available options and there was the option to use free DVDs available from a vending machine in the lobby.In all fairness I have stayed at worse places, but this was below average and the price was a bit high considering that. I would give the hotel a 2.5 out of 5 but that isn't an option but I would say the current 4 out of 5 average is far too high a rating for this hotel, so I give it a 2 for the purpose of balancing.I did not call the blood to the attention of the desk staff because honestly, I really want not to have to do that.

The sprinkler ar the front desk was coated in dust so I knew right away we might not be in the cleanest place. Our room was gross. The wall right next to the bed was so grimy it had dust in it. Looked like pop or champagne was sprayed on it months ago and never cleaned. The picture frames and sprinklers were covered in dust. The bathroom fan was so covered in gunk and dust, no air moved through it. The floor was peeling and bubbled and they had a cheap throw rug over it. We felt we couldn't touch anything. The inexpensive rooms bring a rough crowd too. The second night they were partying so hard next to us, I had to call the front desk around 1 am. He couldn't figure out which room number it was so I had to cover up and go out in the hall to get the room number and call downstairs again. They also had glass bottles and were smoking weed by the pool every night we were there, so me and other families would just leave. Also, not a part of the hotel, but don't use their affiliated shuttle service. They were 1:45 late picking us up from Pearl Harbor. Also, don't waste your time or money at IHOP, go to Aloha Cafe or the coffee shop down the street. The location is the only thing this place has going for it. Very close to small shops, restaurants, and beaches. I always leave a decent review if the staff is exceptional but we didn't receive anything above okay.

They have reef-safe sunscreen 'on-tap' and fresh apples and lemon water in the lobby and your resort fee does get you hotel towels, umbrellas, and beach chairs to borrow. The pool is very family friendly, no deeper than 4ft and quite small, but nice. The pool deck has a barbecue, and tables and chairs and lounge chairs, which is nice, but there is absolutely no shade and no protection from the rain if you are trying to barbecue. It could really use umbrellas or another option for shade.The room we had overlooked the Hilton, and this partial ocean view, so that was lovely, but Ala Moana is one busy, LOUD street. Constant traffic noise and sirens every 5 minutes, and the balcony door did not shut all the way at the bottom, so the noise never really stopped.The room itself was fine, reasonable sized and very clean when we arrived, if a bit worn at the edges. The lampshade was torn, the towels were fraying and the ceiling had a multitude of tiny holes just above the bed, but it was clean so we just moved on. Unfortunately as the week progressed, housekeeping deteriorated. On the final full day, they did not even bother to make up the sofa bed our daughter was sleeping on and they left a dirty rag on the little coffee area. Our sheets they put on had stains more than once and large parts of the floor never ended up getting vacuumed, as evidenced by the very obvious crumbs left from a small spill on day 3 that were there when we left on day 6.The room was very clean on the first 2 days, so I am not sure what happened after that, but it didn't inspire a lot of confidence after that point.The room was in need of some minor repairs, as both the sink and the tap plug did not work and the bathroom fan sounded like a chainsaw, but considering how attentive the maintenance staff was for other issues, I would expect they will be fixed shortly.The location really couldn't be better, there is a grocery store on the back of the block, there are great restaurants all around and it is a very short walk to both Waikiki and the Ala Moana shopping centre. I would still recommend this hotel, especially to travellers on a budget, or with children, just be persistent if there are an issues with housekeeping.

It's just barely OK, as far as it is well run, well located and the staff is most helpful. However, it is not flash, but tired. Plus, I resent paying an extra $25 a day facilities usage fee when I literally came and went to sleep for 2 nights. I was out from 7am to 10pm both days. So, what was that $25 a day extra charge for? in my case?The rooms are small as far as what's available in the City and seem even smaller as they are packed with a desk, table for 2, drawers, a stand-a-long closet and even a counter for tea/coffee w/ underneath fridge. All furnitue is another era - bulky and not tidily designed so w/ a king bed the room, it is not easy to navigate w/o bumping into something. There is NO lighting over the bed to read in bed. Worst thing for me -- the pillows are foam and MOST uncomfortable. I should have paid more $ for a more thoughtfully designed with guest in-mind room.The bath and shower are adequate,but circa the 60's.Once more, if price/value is your hotel selection criteria, this may be the best for the hotel night fee -- EXCEPT for that EXTRA $25 dollar a day...RIP off that is or my visit; I did NOT use ANY facilities except the elevators, and I should not be charged for that.","San Francisco, California","HaljoHal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",302,2.0

We got in late and was given a very small room with no lanai. In the morning, I politely asked for a room with a lanei and the front desk was awesome. They immediately gave us a new room. Be sure to specify when you book to ask for a lanai. Not all rooms have one. I usually am disappointed in having to pay for a resort fee and get nothing in return, but not here at the Aqua Palms. We used the free shuttle 3 different times, always with great service and drivers. We used the free beach chairs and towels and even used the free DVD service to watch a movie after a long day at Pearl Harbor. I felt the resort fee actually gave us useful things to use. Not usually the case at higher end resort hotels.The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The room we were moved to, 625, was perfect.

We checked in with Rick who provided us with a great room as requested; two beds and lanai. There was a fan in the closet which we appreciated. We were also very happy that the beds had blankets instead of the new trend of using duvets which are too heavy and hot.

Smiles every morning. The room was immaculate thanks to the housekeepers. The shuttle driver is very knowledgeable and accommodating-he even borrowed us an umbrella one day when it was raining. They can store your luggage for you if you have a late flight.The hotel: Very clean and well kept. wonderful location within walking distance to everything in Waikiki. Its a 5 minute walk to the beach either through the Hilton Hawaiain village or down the street. It was wonderful to have chairs and towels to take with us where ever we went. We did not use the pool as they needed to clean it. Coffee and lemon ice water are available all day, coffee is 2.00. I suggest buying Kona coffee for your room and buy coffee cream and bring sugar and filters. They have commuters and a printer in the lobby and and there is a rep available to inquire about excursions. Use your key card for discounts! 15% off at Ihop and 10% at the other corner restaurant. We also had a small discount at the aquarium. Important: Hawaii has a very strict smoking law, do not smoke on any public beach, park or on balconies. you can get fined. Excursions:I highly recommend doing the Polynesian Cultural Centre for a day trip and the Breath-Ha show is a must to enhance your experience about Hawaiian culture. We also did the Circle Island Tours with Aloha tours with Ian. What a great experience! We went with 17 other people and got to know each other well. Ian is very knowledgeable and provided us with information regarding Hawaiian history, politics, and knew so much about the sites we visited. We also discovered Magic Beach which is a 20 minute walk or a 5 minute shuttle to Ala Moana Mall, walk across the street and head towards the ocean. It is shallow, great for snorkeling with tons of fish and there is a monk seal who has made her home there. Look for her on the rocks and do not swim too close to her as she is protected by law. There is also a restroom and change room there. Best of all its free! Grab a snack and go. Eating out: Not as expensive as I had heard, however you need to take into consideration the difference of our dollar. You can pick up a healthy snack or breakfast at any ABC store which can be found on almost every corner. The Ihop has a 55 plus special, the restaurants right on the beach can be expensive but you have have an appetizer. Red Lobster and The Cheese Cake Factory are relatively the same and are within walking distance.","Winnipeg, Canada","dana c</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winnipeg, Canada</strong>",4,4.0

The first room we got was a little tired looking so we did ask to switch and they were very accomodating.

It also has a pool (I didn't try it) and a self-laundry which came in very handy. It was also very convenient to have towels and beach chairs available. Our rate included breakfast at either IHop or Wailana Coffee House. The selection was limited but perfectly adequate and worth the money.

That said, the facility wasn’t nice which probably explains the reduced daily rate. The hotel’s parking lot was unbelievably tight, dark and creepy. Our room overlooked a main street and was unbelievably noisy and very cramped. A constant progression of noises from trucks, buses and nearby construction didn’t seem to be attenuated in the slightest way by the hotel’s windows. The room’s air conditioner fan kept turning on and off – when it was off, the room became very hot; when it was on, the fan was loud enough to rattle by my brains. The bathroom vent (which turned on whenever the bathroom light was on) had failing motor bearings which made a terrible screeching noise. The shower didn’t work well.

The elevators were unfortunately really slow - sometimes we were waiting 5 minutes.The room was large and well renovated, big enough to have a sitting area. The small balcony overlooked the Waikiki hotels and beach – sea views! (At least from the upper floors). The bathroom was pathetically small, hardly big enough for even one person, let alone two. The toilet was sandwiched between the tub and the sink and you couldn’t open/close the door while on the toilet. The AC made a bit too much noise as it cycled on and off all night.

I walked through the ""village"" twice (which is really just a mall full of expensive shops) and it takes a good 15 minutes to get to the beach. They do have Friday night fireworks there and that's really fun to watch. We stayed here because in our vrbo deal, reserved parking was included and we had a rental car and a disabled relative with us who needed to be driven most places. The Waikiki stuff that we wanted to do was quite far from the hotel. I drove my friends down to the Kuhio Beach area and then came back to park and walked back to the Kuhio area. It took almost 25 minutes every single time to walk there no matter what route I took--and I was going as fast as I politely could. Driving there is about 15-20 minutes altogether including the garage and traffic. (I think we were on level P3 of the garage which is four sets of ramps.) It takes a good bit of care and time to negotiate all the ramps and corners...THE PARKING GARAGE is a NIGHTMARE. The initial ramp to get in is almost straight up! If you go to fast, you may smash right into cars parked at the top of the ramp. If you go to slow, you will eventually have to gun it a little to get all the way up. It's dicey every single time. The ramps that go from floor to floor are extremely narrow with tight corners you must get around. People hit and/or scrape the walls a lot--there are grooves and chunks of concrete missing from the walls and corners. The paint is severely scraped off and streaks are left from cars scraping by. It is just flat out DANGEROUS.Twice other guests mentioned the crazy garage to me while we were in the elevator. We were so relieved when we made our final descent down that steep final ramp! On the plus side, the staff is genuinely helpful and polite. The air conditioning is often not working well in the reception area--which is not a big deal unless you are waiting in line for help. Then you feel like you are trapped in a sauna.Our room was on the third floor, and there is no view--just other buildings--in case that's important to you.There are more restaurants off the side streets if you walk down past the front of the Hilton area. (Chains like Subway and other sit down places--it's going to take 10 to 15 minutes to get there.) There are a couple of real cheap souvenir shops down the street from the hotel, but we only found IHOP and the Wailana (?) close for restaurants. Walmart has cheap t-shirts if you need them as well and fairly cheap groceries for Hawaii as far as we could tell.Anyway, just some points to take note of. If I were to come back to Honolulu, I would try to get a spot more towards the center of Waikiki for convenience.

We arrived at the hotel and it was very much a 2-star property not a 3-star property. We requested a ocean view one bedroom and they placed us on the 2nd floor with a parking lot view??? Also very disappointing was the fact that the pool was empty due to an electrical short which supposedly had occurred two weeks prior to the reservation being made. It had yet to be repaired. Not a great start for a trip with an 8 year old kid. Based on the number of trips I took in the elevators barely 1.5 of the 3 were working regularly. Long lines and poor lobby layout made this time consuming and inconvenient. The room 205, was also not very clean. I run short-term vacation and corporate rental properties and I can tell you cleanliness is not rocket science if you spend the time and have a good process. This room was anything but clean. I understand its by thw beach but a strong musty smell and black mold spots around the ac vent did not give me a warm fuzzy upon check in.Also the floor sloped badly towards the kitchen area which indicates structural issues with the building. The staff at the front desk were very cordial and attempted to be helpful especially the night supervisor Gen. However after multiple requests to have the hotel manager, Ms Maher, call me, she has yet to do so. The icing on the cake was the pull-out couch for the eight-year-old. This room was designed and sold to have space for 4 with 2 on a queen sized pullout. I oulled it out on the first night and it was completely broken in several places and unusable. The 8 year old spent three nights on a rollaway bed which was also on its last leg. Did they attempt to move us. Yes...was that idea with groceries and luggage for 3 with no assurances the alternative was any better. No not really. You have only one shot at a first impression.This property is BEYOND tired however simple things like making sure Furniture works and the rooms are being cleaned properly are not issues of age, they're issues of attention to detail which this property has little to none.

The location is perfect, right at the gateway of Waikiki. First off, the parking spaces are a bit tight, so anything larger than a full size car would have a difficult time. I am thinking that $25 a day for parking is normal in Waikiki. The staff is polite and helpful. If you check in late, Larry is there to greet you. If not, the others are nice too, like Venus. The rooms are adequately sized and amenities are plentiful; mini refrigerator, safe, coffee maker and an iron are all there. There was also a game console for the kids. The last room I was given had a sofa bed and a queen size bed, a desk and a little table to lay out my belongings. The tv was mounted on the wall so ""counter space"" was abundant. What I appreciate is the black out curtain. Some mornings, you want to sleep in without the sun waking you up. The bathroom is of average size. Shampoo, conditioner and lotion are all there. I don't mind the fragrance of the soap, but my friend said it smelled weird. I like it. Hair dryer is there too. The toilet is elongated (not round). I hate round toilets! The shower tub was ok, but the last room I had could use a bit of resurfacing by the drain. On the positive note, it has an anti-slip surface. Little things I appreciate, especially almost slipping in the tub at another hotel. The shower head wasn't the best and pressure could have been just a bit stronger. I think the hotel is taking steps to conserve water.There are rooms with a balcony and rooms with just a window. It's great to have a cup of coffee in the morning on the balcony, but depending on the floor, the street noise can be loud. Finally, the central air conditioner is nice and strong.

We went during mid-July and the parking garage was absolutely full nearly 24 hours a day. Parking spaces within the 4-5 floors were rarely available. They charged $25 a day and informed us that in the event no parking spaces were available, feel free to head over to the Wailana Coffee House-- on Ena Road and utilize their garage. There were just too many stalls in the garage that said - RESERVED--On one evening after returning past 10p.m, we needed to do that and found out that the flat rate of $15 was charged and there were no in-out privileges once you park in that space and if you needed to move out of the space, you would need to pay another $15. Also, you needed to move the car by 8a.m. the next day before getting ticketed. Very inconvenient but we needed to do what we needed to in order not to ruin our limited vacation time on Oahu.The staff were very courteous and helpful. They tried to help us with the parking issue but it is really not their fault. They have 24 hour cold water down in the lobby and coffee and tea as well as apples during the day. In addition, the Manager has a weekly reception where they serve some appetizers and a special made Hawaiian cold drink in the lobby. They also have a guitar musician/singer that sings ad plays a few Hawaiian tunes during the reception. A nice welcome to Hawaii and able to mingle with other guests in the lobby. There is a $15 daily resort fee and the rooms come with a mini refrigerator and microwave. The swimming pool is located on the 2nd floor and they provide towels. The wifi was working well and we did not encounter any problems or set backs. There is also a daily paper 7 days a week at the lobby. The rooms were clean and pleasant but the place can use some minor repair work as there were some cracks in the walls that could utilize a paint job. The outlet plugs could also use some upgrade as some were a bit loose. All in all, Aqua Palms is located in a convenient spot in the Waikiki area- right across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Rainbow Village and a 10-15 minute walk to the Ala Moana Shopping Center. The walk into the heart of Waikiki is only about 20 minutes or so and it is all level.

You should note that this is not on the beach and it is about a 20 minute walk to the Waikiki beach. There is a closer beach that you can go to as well which is also great for swimming.The check-in and out were both quick and easy. The lifts are slow but the room was spacious, had a nice balcony and was clean. They also provided beach towels (with a deposit) at the front desk. You can get straight to the car park in the lift which is very useful. The service at the front desk was friendly and we noted a stand for recommended activities and tours.Beware of the 'free car hire' package with Alamo. Alamo car hire is not at the airport, you need to get the (free) Alamo shuttle from the airport to the car hire. Also with all of the extra taxes and charges, this is NOT free car hire, it cost us about $150 for two days. However, it is definitely cheaper than booking a car separately so if you were going to get a car anyway, then it is probably worthwhile.The car park is narrow. We had a midsize car and just about managed to get around the corners, if the car was any larger, we would have had difficulties.We didn't have trouble finding a space though (in October). The car park is $25 per day.I would recommend this to travellers on a budget. It is not a luxury hotel but the room was modern and clean and the service was good.

I found the staff wonderful to deal with, and the room was excellent. I highly recommend asking for room 1115, because it is high enough to avoid the noise, and I loved sitting out on the balcony enjoying the view. The first day I was quite dazed from my 11 hour flight from NY so I didn't notice that there was a slight ocean view looking off to the left on the balcony. I enjoyed being in the back because it was incredibly peaceful at night. I don't like freezing AC so I left the patio doors quite wide open to get a breeze, there was only one brief incident of noise the final night just as i was about to go to sleep where someone was playing loud music but fortunately it died down quite quickly. I found the bed very comfortable, I can't bear a hard mattress, and the pillowtop was perfect. The elevators were better than last time, worked quite smoothly, only one time on my final day as i went out to breakfast the elevator was crowded with about 8 people possibly due to a major convention in town. I went out to the coffee shop nearby and it was too crowded at 8AM so came back at 9:20 and had the place to myself. (and a 10% discount when I showed my room card) I felt very safe in Waikiki and enjoyed going down the street that resembles Bev Hills in LA with Dior, Fendi,Harry Winston Jewelry, Cartier, etc going along the beach. (Kalakaua Ave.) I did find Waikiki more expensive than last visit but I noticed if one ventured out via McCully to go to downtown Honolulu the prices were better. I highly recommend a tiny unpretentious place where I had an excellent garlic shrimp and rice and bottled water water for $11, it was called Regal Diner and it was in that first shopping center as you get over McCully on the bridge and hit the first intersection of Kapiolani Blvd. 1960 Kapiolani Blvd is where you will find Regal. Unfortunately I discovered it on my last night of my 8 night stay. I did have some nice meals at a Korean Restaurant right near the hotel but it was pricier. (closer to $30) Honolulu reminds me a lot of LA, it has the sad aspects of LA and the good parts. The homeless were very tragic and I didn't notice them at first as much as in 2013 but they were there. I never felt confronted by them however. I walked all the way over the bridge on McCully over Highway 1 and walked way up a hill and had a nice view and also reached the University of Hawaii. I also took bus number 57 to go to a lovely suburban town of Kailua, which I caught at Ala Moana Shopping Center. The trip with the gorgeous mountains was breathtaking. It seemed most of the people on the bus were bored by their usual commuter trip but I loved it, despite rainy weather. Anyway, I digress from the hotel experience, I would say my only tiny bit of criticism was how difficult it was to initially open the patio door, maybe it needs some oil, once I got it open about 6 inches then it was easy. The view of the high rises and the mountains were lovely from the terrace. I wish I hadn't missed the Hawaiian music in the hotel Wed night, because I made the mistake of thinking it was Thurs night. I did catch a fun dance performance on Kalakaua Ave, put on by the Polynesian Center, where they invited a few audience members to participate with repeating tribal screams and banging drums. They wore colorful costumes and were most entertaining. I wish I could remember the names of all the people at the hotel who were so gracious and helpful to me. The lady with the long hair on the tourism desk was especially pleasant. The ABC stores all nearby were so helpful and a yuppie ish grocery store around the block, Food Pantry, although expensive had everything I needed including fresh diced pineapple that was out of this world, I learned from my 1st visit how one has never truly ""eaten"" pineapple until you are in Hawaii! I never used the hotel pool but I did peek in and it looked great. It seemed the walls of the hotel were thick enough to not hear any neighbors. (the music mentioned earlier I heard from a neighboring balcony) It was a cheerful room very clean with plenty of towels and a half fridge and a microwave. The TV was good with lots of channels and no problem with the cable connection. The shower head was strong and there was plenty of hot water. Considering the reasonable price they gave me for my 8 night stay I was pleased with being placed on such a high floor. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonable place to stay, but there were no corners cut here, it was first rate. I had one tiny issue with a non working toilet a few days in and they sent the maintenance guy up promptly to fix it. He was polite and did not intrude. I also was very pleased with how well the safe worked, I don't have a laptop but I did have other stuff that was quite valuable to me, and securing it each day was comforting. This place is not the ritz but it is clean, and well run, and I dread to think of what being in a lesser hotel and having a problem with the toilet working would have been like. Before I close I also want to say how much I enjoyed finally going to the royal palace, which was magnificent and also I went to the Honolulu Art Museum twice, and the Zoo was great. There is so much to do in Honolulu, give yourself at least 8 nights. The hotel is right near a bus stop that will scoot you to the airport, take either the 19 or 20. It took only 40 minutes to get there for a paltry $2.50 and the driver was super nice, and so compassionate towards the many homeless who were riders. He was such a gentleman and really cared about his riders and valued them. DON'T bring on a large carry on bag, that it not permitted, I had a gym bag sized bag which was fine. I hated to leave and long to go back someday and I am certain that I will stay at Aqua Palms again. I also like that I got double airline miles by paying my hotel bill with my Hawaiian Airlines Mastercard. That card bonus miles paid for my entire round trip flight. (35K bonus miles) PS. I highly recommend Speedi Shuttle which was professional at getting me from the airport to the hotel quickly and at such a low rate ($16) I gave the man an $8 tip because he earned it with his maholo spirit! I was so exhausted after the 11 hour plane trip and seeing that Speedi Shuttle was so professional eased my jangled nerves. They even have a desk in the Honolulu airport baggage claim area. The driver was very entertaining with all of us including a family from Australia. It is apparent he loves his job. Anyway I will be back to Honolulu one of these days!!!","Bronx, New York","MBSilver</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bronx, New York</strong>",23,5.0

I wouldn't say it's the safest of areas at night, but nothing ever happened to me when I was walking back at night to the hotel.My first experience with check in the girl was hopeless, and not interested in answering any of my questions. She was more interested in reapplying her makeup and looking at her phone. When I came back later to check in, there was another girl I had was fabulous and very attentive. Overall, I would stay at the hotel again, but if you are looking for something really close to Waikiki don't stay there unless you're willing to do the walk or catch a bus. I was staying on a floor where they were doing construction, my air con kept breaking down, and my toilet blocked up which wasn't pleasant, but otherwise I thought the hotel was pretty good for what you paid. It's clean and walking distance to most places.","Brisbane, Australia","Travellingisliving83</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",45,3.0

Needed a hotel room fast. The nice lady at the SpeediShuttle desk ($29-$30 roundtrip airport shuttle to and from hotels) had stayed at the Aqua Palms and had a pleasant experience, evidently. I typically stay at nicer properties, but hey..... any port in a storm. The price was a reasonable $158 (Kama'aina rate) including taxes, and my expectations were geared accordingly. The front desk staff person was polite and pointed out the IHOP next door. No in house restaurant i.e. no room service. The first room smelled of something burnt, maybe popcorn. The rooms feature microwaves and a small fridge. I called to the front desk from the room and requested a new room, suggesting that as long as someone was coming up to the 7th floor to check out the burning smell, how about bringing a new room key. The desk clerk was sympathetic and agreeable. A staff person showed up quickly and nicely assisted me in relocating to another 7th floor room. The next room was smell-free. I noted a plastic toothpick wrapper on the floor. Other than that the room appeared clean, but clearly had seen better days and is need of renovation. In addition to the bed, there was a sofa and a small round top cafe table and two chairs, a bureau and a desk. The lamp on the desk had a plug-in for electronics, but not the two bedside lamps. Two plug-ins were available on wall outlets. My room had windows facing the street and there was traffic noise. I congratulated myself on having a white noise app on my cell.

The room was comfortable with a huge bed and flat screen TV. We had no major issues with the quality of the room. The only frustrating matter was the WiFi was not operating in our room for this entire stay but could be accessed from the foyer. Our second 9-day stay was for the marathon. It was only a 15 minute walk to the start of the marathon and this was an attraction. When we checked in my wife was upset when we discovered our room had no balcony. We were so looking forward to having this in our room. I immediately asked for our room to be changed and it was done so straight away. This time we were on the beach side. WE used the trolley bus seven day pass and it was handy that one of the trolleys (Pink line) stops outside Aqua Palms.

It wasn't a great start to our Hawaiian family vacation. On the first day, we were given our room key. We got up to the room and the key didn't work. I walked down to the front desk and told them about the problem. They re-issued a new key and again, it didn't work. Luckily, a member of housekeeping was there and was able to get in. Once we were in the room, we decided to try again with the key and couldn't get it to work. At this point, after traveling 17 hours, we were a little discouraged and a little mad. We called the front desk and they said they would send a maintenance person up. My dad and I went out for a walk on the beach and my mom stayed in the room. She said the maintenance man didn't come up for another hour. He couldn't figure it out, so we had to change rooms. You'd think that was the end of the key debacle, but it wasn't. In the new room, the key didn't work either.I could go on even further about this, but suffice it to say, the keys are unreliable (the front desk staff has no problem acknowledging this) and we had to get a new key every single day we stayed here.Now, onto everything else:- Good location, about a five minute walk from the beach- No restaurant (but we knew that) but an iHOP that is connected to the hotel had good food- When we stayed, the air conditioning was out of service. We were given a fan for our room. With the fan on and the door open, it was fine. When we checked out, they kindly refunded us some money (parking and the resort fee), so that was very nice and we appreciated it.- Overall, the hotel needs a remodel and a good throrough cleaning. It's sort of dingy and there are only a few elevators for the whole place. Getting anywhere took a little while.So I guess in conclusion, I will admit that you get what you pay for. It's not an upscale place, it's not a rotten place, it's just sort of OK. If you're looking to do Honolulu cheaply, this is a good option. And if you're out of the room more than you're in it (like we were), it'll do.",,Bethany K,13,3.0

Good location and close to food, shopping and the beach though you are not paying for beach front room (across the street through the Hilton Villa). Staff and housekeeping are super nice, friendly and talkative/engaging. Relatively clean. CONS: it may have just been my room but this place is starting to get pretty run down. It seems like a neglected child of a well-to-do family. Perhaps we got a run down room because we were so last minute. The other locations in the area and the ads on TV and the internet look way more modernized than what we experienced. The construction was just shoddy. Things like the bathroom vent being held up by sticky strips; the bathroom didn't have a full counter/sink but a wall sink and there was what looked like an old nightstand moved in the bathroom to put stuff on. the tile work seemed slapped together and the curtain rod seemed like it was supposed to be one of those that bows out to give you more room but instead there was a hobbled together extender rod that was rusty and the shower/bath was so narrow it was awkward though the tub was a super long tub...none of our furniture matched in the room and it was like a shabby chic beachcomber's décor hobbled together from the eighties and nineties. The sheets were a little threadbare and didn't smell like detergent was used in the wash. I know they send the laundry out but though the fact that ""palms"" was stamped in black ink on everything was a little odd. The towels, though, were nice and white and of good quality. Finally, if you have a sugary drink - get rid of it and don't bring it in the room as our one drink attracted teeny tiny ants which mostly went away after we got rid of the drink.

But the room was so hot in the morning that my husband was dripping with sweat when he left for his morning meetings.Also, I guess it should have occurred to me that scaffolding outside the windows meant workers would be there at some point, but I'd received no warning upon check in, so I was quite unhappy to be woken by power tools outside my room in the morning.

Military rate restrictions meant I had to adhere to the allowed TLA-rates, which isn't easy in Waikiki. The Aqua Palms accepted the rate (as is typical for them, apparently) and I was able to easily get a room for 10 nights. However, it wasn't the greatest experience.There is parking ($25/day regular, $10/day TLA rate) in the garage; no valet, which isn't a big deal. However, there's not really anywhere in front of the hotel to park and unload baggage unless you park on the sidewalk. The garage is small and somewhat difficult to park in if you have a larger vehicle, and it's not the most convenient parking of the Waikiki hotels. I was able to check in without any difficulty after making a same-day reservation. When I got to my room, I found that the key reader wasn't working well; throughout my stay it often took 5-6 swipes of the key to open the door, and there were a few other people having the same issue. The room was pretty small, probably as a function of the TLA rate. However, there was enough space for baggage and to unpack. Furniture was pretty old and all looked like it came from a thrift store, but it was functional. The bed and pillows were surprisingly comfortable and the AC, controlled by a wall thermostat, could be ICE cold if you wanted it, which was nice given the heat wave. Also, had a microwave and fridge which functioned well and were clean.The room as a whole looked well used; it was obvious that no recent updates had happened. The bathroom looked like a truck stop restroom and handicap-accessible shower collided. There was no counter/vanity. The sink was public restroom style, mounted to the wall with visible pipes underneath. There was a busted and peeling piece of furniture which looked like a nightstand that acted as the vanity and could be moved around the bathroom. Also, it was very sterile/white/bright; no granite or anything nice. Water pressure in the sink was terrible and it was difficult to get hot water, which made shaving difficult. When I checked in to the room, I noticed that there were other peoples hairs (based on color and length, probably from at least 4 people) stuck to the bathroom and shower walls, as well as on the floor. There was also a piece of broken glass on the floor, and the housekeeping folks forgot to stock some wash clothes.To be quite honest, other than the bathroom, the room was clean enough and without major issues.The hotel has 3 elevators, only 2 of which functioned during my stay. For a 12 floor hotel with 5 additional levels for parking and lobby, this was inconvenient. At one point, all elevators stopped working, though this was related to flooding and was relatively quickly fixed. No word on why the 3rd one never worked.There is an IHOP; no other restaurant. No bar. No spa facilities. No beach access. The pool is very small, but usable. Laundry facilities exist, but were nearly constantly busy. This is NOT the hotel you are looking for if you want a luxury vacation. Go across the street to the Hilton or the Modern. If you want Oahu for cheap, then this is probably your place. On the plus side, it is pretty well located in Waikiki and you can't really beat the price. The internet is also free and very fast, so if you need it for business, you'll get it here.","Holly Springs, North Carolina","249seanr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Holly Springs, North Carolina</strong>",17,3.0

The rooms are pretty basic but we didn't care, as we are outdoorsy and on the go most of the time. Returning this year for a family vacation, my husband and I searched all the affordable yet well rated hotels in Waikiki. And we decided to return to Aqua Palms. Why? The location near the shopping district, beach and Hilton Hawaiian Village and its many amenities can't be beat. Another plus is the large public salt water lagoon at the HHV that is perfect for families. The staff is friendly and the concierge very knowledgeable and helpful. And there are two family friendly restaurants and a great variety of others literally right downstairs or across the street. Again, nothing fancy and the pool is really tiny but it's a super little hotel for travelers looking for a great location. ",,Irene G,17,4.0

We were very pleased with the fact that there was a refrigerator, microwave and coffeemaker in the room so we didn't have to eat out every meal for a week! The room also had a sleeper sofa and a small dining table and chairs which was nice and I loved sitting out on the balcony in the morning drinking my coffee! Had nice views of the city and mountains and could even see the ocean between a couple of buildings! The hotel is located just across the street from Hilton Hawaiian Village (which is very upscale and just beautiful) and you can walk through their lovely grounds to the beach ... there are many restaurants and shops right there!The hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly. Right down the street from Ala Moana Mall which is lovely and adjacent to an IHOP where we are a couple of yummy meals! Also there is plenty of inexpensive public transportation to sightsee in the area so you don't really need a rental car. The weather was amazing the entire week we were there and we had a rental car so drove all over Oahu! Really enjoyed Waikiki Beach, Diamond Head, Pearl Harbor, the north shore area, Hanuma Bay (beautiful snorkeling) and the Dole pineapple plantation. So many lovely beaches on Oahu, Kailua and Lanikai were my faves!

That being said, the rooms are clean, albeit on the small side – more European-sized than American-sized. Your odds of getting a room with a balcony are two in three (for either ocean or city view), and we unfortunately lost that lottery when we were assigned our room.Beds are on the firm side; expect numb arms if you sleep on your side. The bathroom was a little cramped, and while well-lit over the counter/sink, there was no lighting directly around the shower, which means you are showering or bathing in very little light. The room included a small refrigerator and microwave.We had a problem with our room, specifically the air conditioning unit. The A/C was very ineffective, barely able to cool the room 1-2 degrees Fahrenheit over the course of several hours. Our room was on the north side of the building resulting in a lot of sunlight hitting the window and heat accumulating during the day. I spoke with the front desk about this, and while the person said they would contact their maintenance people, the problem was never fixed during our three night stay.Parking is available on-site (garage) for $25/day. The hotel has the usual (for Hawaii) resort/hospitality fee of $15/day which basically gets you Wi-Fi access.Location-wise, the Aqua Palms is located towards the western edge of Waikiki which has its advantages and disadvantages – you’re away from the main hustle and bustle of Waikiki, but it’s a short drive, trolley, or bus to get there if that is what you are interested in. You’re a five-minute walk from the Ala Moana Shopping Center.As the review title indicates, you get what you pay for. The Aqua Palms is one of the less-expensive hotels in Waikiki, and the trade off is a small room (possibly without a balcony) in a slightly dated hotel away from the main beach and shopping in Waikiki.

All the staff were very pleasant and helpful. There was a $15.00 per day fee which we were aware of before travelling. We thought this was fine as the hotel has a shuttle service which goes between about six of the hotels within the chain and the Ala Moana shopping centre. With how the hotels are spread out you could easily get to all different parts of Waikiki on this service. So that saved us $10 cabs during the day and evening. They stopped running at about 9pm. The only small issue we had whilst starting there was one of the lamp shades was broken but that didn't faze us as we were out and about most of the time.

Off street parking was adequate but, like others, we did get a warning under our windshield wiper for forgetting to put a placard on our dash when parked overnight. We also had to have the same conversation with the front desk 3 times about hospitality fee and parking charges before all was right. But, that was relatively minor in the overall stay and we had a decent experience there. Oh -- somewhere else, I think I saw it written that they have a business center -- I don't believe that they do.

I had previously stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village but did not want to spend $300+ per night! So knowing the area I picked the Aqua Palms. I was not disappointed! The rooms are clean and the staff is really wonderful! There are a few things they could work on like a broken lamp shade and a slippery tub (could use something nonskid) but over all the location and the price can't be beat! They have a shuttle that will take you to any of the other properties they own in Waikiki for free so its an easy way to get around the city without paying for a taxi or a trolley. Tip: If you want to rent a car but don't want to pay the outrageous parking fees in the garages, located 5 minutes away are Alamo and Enterprise where you can rent the car and then return it that same day! We did it and did our own circle tour of the island for a fraction of what the tour companies cost.

Not so this time. I feel very disappointed to be writing this review but I need to share this so others are not caught in the same trap my husband and I found ourselves in.Due to positive experiences in the past, we booked directly with the Hotel. We received an Invoice which appeared to be in order though the break-down of the room rate and other charges etc. were not disclosed properly. We trusted the Hotel to do the right thing by us since this was our fourth stay with them. When we arrived at the Hotel at 10.00 a.m. on the 7th of May, our room was not ready. That was understandable. We were able to leave our luggage at the Hotel and told to return at approximately 2.00 p.m. When we arrived at 2.00 p.m. the staff were not able to tell us if our room was ready. They had to check and we had a further 10 minute wait. We and the check-in staff at the Hotel were under the impression that because we had booked our room last year, we were not going to be charged the $15.00 per day Hospitality fee. We were told the fee was ""optional"". The fee is outrageous. It covers many things that used to once be free at the Hotel.First appearances seemed to indicate that our room was fine. But after a few days in the room, I noticed the drapes were quite dirty and dusty. The furniture and room is now very dated. Air-conditioning is very noisy. My husband walked around our room one day without shoes or socks on. By the time he came to have a shower that night, he noticed his feet were quite dirty presumably from the carpet.We chose to hire a car for one week of our stay and were aware of the $25.00 parking fee. That was fine with us. What we did not expect though was to receive a Parking Violation notice from the Hotel advising us that our vehicle was improperly parked because ""vehicle has no valid parking permit"". Seriously??? The Hotel had the Licence plate number/registration of our car. Because we forgot to display the sign one day, you chastise us like some over zealous parking officer. The Hotel knew we were guests.We stayed in Room 1024 which adjoins the Maids' Closet and the back stairwell. Even after 11.00 p.m. at night, the doors would slam often. Presumably staff were in and out of the Closet storage room or guests using the rear stairwell.By the time our check out date came around, I felt a big sense of disappointment that our visit to the Aqua Palms Waikiki had been such a let down. To add insult to injury upon paying our bill, we saw that we had been charged the $15.00 per day Hospitality fee! Given that our cab driver was waiting to take us to the Airport for our flight home to Australia, we did not have the time or the energy to dispute this with the Hotel.Sadly, we will no longer chose the Aqua Palms Waikiki again when we holiday/vacation in Honolulu.",Melbourne,"DebMelbourne</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",12,1.0

Worst of all was the fact that they would not compensate me for two days lost at hotel because of cancelled flights by Jetstar. They were informed within 24 hours and still had no empathy for me for the lost days. Still charged ""resort"" expenses for not being there. Not happy at all. Also, when finally arriving it took receptionist such a long time to even find my booking and was so confused and unapologetic at not finding my booking. Rooms very small for such a high price. I know Aqua Palm is considered a 3.5 star hotel but I expected more for my hard earned dollars. Loved Waikiki Beach and surrounds but will certainly look for a better deal next time.

No complaints, room was clean and a good size with partial views of diamond head and a sliver of a view of the ocean from the balcony. The huge Hilton complex stands between the beach and this hotel so Ocean views are only partial but for the price it's a great deal, considering how close of a walk this hotel is to the beach as well as to shopping and restaurants and pretty much everything you need to enjoy Honolulu and Wailiki beach. The beach towels are a bit over used and could use some updating as was some of the linen in the bathroom, but it was all clean and these can easily be updated if the hotel chooses to.","New York City, New York","karanjasan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",4,4.0

When I called to inquire a nice clerk named Berna took my call. She was very helpful as she cancelled my room and assisted me in providing proof of my cancelled flight. When I arrived she greeted me warmly and set us up in a nice city view room. The room was very clean and the bed comfortable. They held our bags while we took a tour of Pearl Harbor. When we were leaving, Berna called out to me across the room to say goodbye. She made us feel like we were staying with a friend! The hotel is located near the beach and boat harbor and most tours offered to pick us up at the front door. Many restaurants were nearby.

Mati was exceptional! Heads up if you are coming with a rental car there is not much of a place to pull in on the front of the building so we had to park by the garage entrance and wait for a bit before we got the code to enter. However this did not bother me but FYI, Honolulu is a busy place.The building has a clean facade, the lobby was clean and nicely decorated, and the rooms were very clean. Housekeeping did a great job at refreshing our room daily. They give you complimentary DVD rentals, beach towels, chairs, and on Wednesdays they have an GM reception with free cocktails and appetizers.The parking was $25 a day but hey that is how it is in Waikiki area and we at least felt safe to keep our car and belongings here.We stayed at the Jr. suite which I highly recommend as it has extra space for a small living room with a couch, and a dining room table. We also had a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker.All and all for the price I am more than pleased and I would definitely stay here when I return to Honolulu.Mahalo Nui & thumbs up to all the staff members at the Aqua Palms Waikiki.","Kapaa, Hawaii","KauaiSoulTr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kapaa, Hawaii</strong>",4,5.0

The building is a combination of hotel rooms and rooms that are owned/operated by private owners.We stayed in a room that was owned by a private owner/operator, so I don't think it was kept up to the standards of the rest of the hotel. But I don't think it was much different than the other rooms and the amenities were all the same.ROOM - Our room was a good size, there was a queen sized bed that was actually pretty comfortable, a sleeper sofa, a dining table for 3, a dresser and a desk. There was also a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker and a toaster with some plates/cups. We thought it was kind of dark and dingy looking and could definitely use some modernizing and updating of the decor. In general we thought it was kind of dirty feeling, which could have also been due to the darkness of the room. The washroom was very small, and the tub did not drain well. In fact it sometimes wouldn't drain at all until you opened and closed the drain quickly a bunch of times. There was a flat screen tv, but we didn't use it.WIFI - The hotel had free wifi. Sometimes you had to sign in with a code, and other times it would connect automatically. It was very random, but nice to have when it worked.LOCATION - The location was the best part about this place. It was walking distance to all of the attractions downtown and directly across from the Hilton Hawaiian Village for shopping, restaurants and if you can sneak in to use their pools, I would suggest it!POOL - The pool was located on the second floor and wasn't usually busy.There were reclining chairs and patio tables and chairs for the guests to use. These were very old looking and the tables were always dusty/dirty. We used the pool two days and were always able to get seats in the sun. There weren't options for shade until later in the day. It would have been nice if they had umbrellas at the tables and cleaned their stuff every morning. There was a BBQ at the pool that you could have the hotel staff start for you to use.LAUNDRY - There were laundry facilities located in the parking garage (a random place) we saw a few people doing laundry while we were there, but there was nowhere to really sit, and due to the location, I wouldn't leave my laundry unattended if I were to do any.Good to know - During our stay we didn't see a single bug. My husband thoroughly checked the bed for bedbugs and didn't see any. We also left food out a few times by accident, (and because we were not official hotel guests we had to empty our own garbages) and there were no cockroaches. Elevators were VERY slow no matter when you were calling them. This hotel is on a main street (Ala Moana) which is very loud at night, but also very convenient for shopping, eating and getting around. Bus stops are directly in front, IHOP is on the main level, there is a great diner at the end of the block and the ABC store is around the corner.STAFF - The front desk staff were helpful and there was an onsite activity/entertainment person who could help you book activities and excursions.PARKING - Paid parking is available at a daily rate. The parking garage is terrible to navigate, so smaller cars would be recommended. We had free parking because our rental included a spot.OVERALL - Perhaps if you were an official hotel guest, the rooms might be a little nicer, however all of the amenities are the same regardless of which room you are in. Basically, you get what you pay for which for this hotel isn't much. If you plan to just sleep in this room, and not spend a lot of time there it is worth the money you will save.","Toronto, Canada","TheAverageTourist</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",106,2.0

The lowest price rooms don't have a real balcony, they have a sliding glass door with a railing in front of it, and a large column right in the middle! But, since it overlooked the street, there really wasn't much of a reason to sit on a balcony! The pool was small and not heated, so it was almost too cold to get into.

Navigating the parking garage was a little nerve wracking the first time. The $25 per night parking fee is a little more nerve wracking!The room was very comfortably furnished with a large comfortable bed, couch, sitting area and a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. I am a low maintenance traveler, so as long as I can sleep , shower and shave, I'm good. This place easily met those requirements. The coffee machine in room was perfect. The internet connection is strong. The bathroom is small (one person at a time), the water pressure is good and the amenities (soaps etc..) are much appreciated. The air conditioning worked well. The small fridge was perfect for keeping drinks cold. The traffic noise starts early (around 6am), but I'm an early riser, so it did not bother me. I was able to walk to everything I needed around Waikiki, and would not have gotten a rental car if I didn't have to travel to the other side of the island for business.

We had a partial ocean view suite, which was perfect for us. It was wonderful to look out onto the ocean (and the Hilton Village). The hotel is walking distance from all of the little shops in the Hilton Village, as well as several beach parks. It's also walking distance from the Ala Moana shopping center and Waikiki, both of which we walked to several times while we were there. For those times that our feet were a little tired after a day of activity, we were able to catch the Aqua Hospitality shuttle that runs between the different Aqua properties and the Ala Moana shopping center, and is included in the daily hospitality fee. We also used the beach towels almost every day. In hindsight, we wish we would have asked for two towels per person--one to lay on and one to dry off of, especially since they don't charge you per towel (unless you do not return your towel cards at check out).The room itself was very roomy. It's definitely not a luxury hotel, but it is so functional and very comfortable. The fridge was helpful for storing leftovers, and the coffee pot helped with making oatmeal breakfast. There was also a microwave. The only slight issue I had with the room was the bathroom. It had a full-sized counter, but because of the layout of the shower/tub, we only really had access to half of it. Also, there was no direct light in the shower, so it was kind of dark when using the shower. On the plus side, while it was a short tub, it was really deep, which was nice!In addition to the hotel shuttle, we also found that Aqua Palms was located near several bus stops for the local bus that we opted to use in lieu of renting a car or using the Waikiki Trolley.Overall, we were very, very happy with the hotel. My husband says he would give this a 4.5 rating, and we would definitely consider staying here again.","Kalamazoo, Michigan","amusingames</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kalamazoo, Michigan</strong>",26,4.0

It's on the main street with nearby bus stops leading in/out of Waikiki and within walking distance or a short shuttle ride to the Ala Moana Mall. Situated across from beach front hotels near the marina, the Aqua Palms is perfect for less crowding and still a close walk for access to the beach and plenty of reasonably priced shops. The staff here were very good. Ryan at the front desk was very accommodating and showed us how to use the transit system and plan trips. Oscar was a diligent maintenance guy who was prompt and persisted until problems were resolved in quick order - and kept us informed every step of the way. As its on the main strip, the traffic noise is loud until about midnight, and then the trucks start up again around 4am. There are partial beach views and small balconies available, so we could see the weather and waves. We could also see part of Diamondhead from our room. There is free Wi-Fi in the rooms; free movie rentals; a free shuttle to the mall every half hour or so; a free morning paper; free low-quality apples; free tea, coffee or cold water 24/7 (we got tea in the lobby because the room stock was rarely replaced once used); and a manager's ""Swing"" on Wednesdays at 5pm featuring a free snack and a special Hawaiian drink (be there at 5pm for the snack of chips and dip, some cheese and salami slices - not a meal but some tried to make it such and it goes fast). There is also a $15/day Concierge fee for very little to no service given, but who will give advice or book tours (also being paid commissions from the tour agencies hired through them). We used the internet and bused to all venues at much lower cost than tours ($2.50 each) and more time to explore than any tour will allow - so this Concierge money was wasted on us and accounted as a needless surtax to our room. The room itself was large, with king sized bed and sofa hide-a-bed, which would have easily accommodated 4 people for sleeping but little else. It had a microwave (needs cleaning), small fridge with freezer area, iron and board, coffee maker, and a blow dryer. The bathroom was very small and would be difficult to maneuver, maybe even impossible if disabled. The bathroom door opens against the toilet and must be closed to sit or access the shower, and allows very little standing room when open. Doubt any wheelchair or walker could get by when closing the door. The carpet is old and recommend not walking on it barefoot - our feet were blackened by it - likely volcanic ash in the air that had settled and not been vacuumed up. The cleaning staff is not the best outside of making beds and changing towels, and the room was rather satisfactory but not impressive to hang-out in. A good place to sleep and launch out every morning though. Fair price that fluctuates up and down based on the popular demand for rooms in Waikiki generally instead of a set rate. Use a AAA card to get a discount deal. There is also an IHOP attached and between 6 - 8 am good seating and breakfast service before the 9 o'clock crowds arrive. On Thursdays between 9am - 5pm, a free caricature artist is on site and worth getting a picture done for a tip. Also, there are other nearby breakfast haunts on Ala Moana and Ena Road, as well as a few more bar style eateries nearby. A shrimp tent just went up at the Chinese restaurant next door before we left and it was better than anything else on the strip - well worth the try, and good value ($13 for 10 jumbo shrimp, garlic or sriracha spiced, rice, and a free bottle of water). There is an ABC on both corners and a Food Pantry just around the corner on Hobron Lane. For its location and practicality, I would use this hotel again.","Winnipeg, Canada","Dan A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winnipeg, Canada</strong>",62,3.0

The two miniscule areas for eating were extremely crowded, and the amount of warm food was inadequate for the number of people staying in the hotel. The service was poor / average - all three people I encountered at the front desk clearly care little about their job. The young woman was hands down the worst - her attitude bordered on rude. I doubt the management ever reads these reviews, but if they do, they need to do a much better job with training and supervising their front desk staff. Ultimately, it was a decent stay. Not bad, but not great.Oh, and two tips for people staying here: there are a few good, family-friendly restaurants across the street (be careful when crossing the street - the traffic is dangerous).

We kept the door to the balcony open at night and slept just fine with the exception of one night when there were many emergency vehicles in the area.The accessible room had a bed and a pull-out sofa. I got the sofa (the things we do for our parents!) and it was more comfortable than most. When opened it did make the room tight and the closet door couldn't open fully. The bathroom had a roll-in shower and everything worked just fine.The AC unit was loud when operating but the outside temps were cool enough to leave the balcony door open at night with the sheers pulled closed. My uncle's room had an annoying noise from the unit when it was off. They weren't able to fix it promptly and offered to move him to another room which worked just fine.There are a few things that would enhance the accessible room however. Adding a few shelves on the bathroom wall above the lightswitch would add some much needed storage space for those not in a wheelchair. The rolling cart was a great addition but a bit more flat space would be great. There is a mini fridge and a microwave in the entryway and we made great use of the fridge. The microwave is located in an upper cabinet which is unaccessible to short people and anyone in a wheelchair. You might consider removing the upper cabinet and moving the microwave to the countertop.

Exceptional location and value: just across the street from Hilton Hawaiian Village, which means a nice leisurely stroll to the beach through the Hilton grounds, but the room price is lower. Wailana Coffee House and IHOP are located in the same block. Do not think this hotel is far from the center of Waikiki: I walked from here to the other end of Waikiki (to Park Shore Hotel) in about 35 minutes, so you can imaging that to get to everything in between will take less time, especially if you use trolley (pink line).The rooms are quite large (especially if you get one with 2 beds). Our room was clean, comfy beds, nice sitting area, large balcony with a table and chairs, and microwave, fridge as well as free WiFi and local calls were all nice additions to my stay. No real complains about anything about our room other than a bit loud A/C unit, but I simply adjusted the temperature to a bit higher level (which I do not mind) so that A/C does not turn on often at night.I did not get to use their swimming pool or exercise room, so cannot comment on that. I got a package with a daily breakfast for 2 at IHOP, but I did not get the value I expected from those vouchers: very limited choice and you'll probably get tired of that in a matter of a few days (as I did). So I would not recommend that package. Also, we got a room with Diamond Head view. The downside of that was that that side of the hotels is facing Ala Moana Boulevard, which is a very busy street day and night, so unless you're on a hight floor, the street noise may be very bothersome. So, either request a room on a higher floor, or on the other side of the hotel, or simply keep your balcony closed for the night.The other thing was that we were 4 of us and initially we were given a room with 1 bed and 1 sofa bed. Well, you can probably imaging that it was not really what I expected, especially considering that all 4 of us are adults. Plus in that room, there were only two bath towels, so obviously during less busy period (and I stayed there for New Year) this type of room is designed for just two adults. So I went to front desk and asked if we could move to a room with 2 beds. I did not expect much since it was New Year time but a woman at the front desk said they'd have a room with 2 beds in a few days and that they could move us there at that time. That was very nice of them. I really appreciated it. The only inconvenience when we moved to the new room was that we had to ask for a 4th bath towel pretty much every day (yes, there were only 3 towels when we moved into the new room, although the room is designed for 4 people). I do not know, may be it's a way they conserve the use of towels... But other than that, the stay was excellent, staff very polite and accommodating and overall this hotel is of great value. I'd definitely stay there again if my travels bring me back to Honolulu.","Vancouver, Canada","Igor C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",4,5.0

This was the best rate we found and we booked over the phone. The person on the other end was not the friendliest person I've ever talked with. Check in was uneventful, but the room was also uninspiring. That's OK as I wasn't looking for that. I could not cool the room. I kept thinking it would get better, but it never did. Tried opening the patio door, but the noise was terrible. The $15 amenities fee is ridiculous. I used nothing other than the WIFI to check email and conform my flight.

Granted, it was the holidays seasons, and while most hotels in Waikiki were fully booked, the Aqua Palms was one of the few that still have rooms. But when you pay ~$300 per night, and you're given the worst room in the house, in which the bed barely fit, and the floor has a slope, you really can't consider it a nice hotel.It's an old property, and it shows, for example the AC made cracking noises all night, even when it was turned off. There were too much furniture for the size of the room. The three chairs were made of some tatami-straw material, something very uncomfortable, specially for a hotel room where you want to relax.The good things are the 42"" TV, the free WiFi, the in-room coffee machine, the microwave, and the fridge (empty, but I could put my own drinks in it). The staff was very nice and always trying to help, but they're Hawaian after all, and Hawaian people is very nice by definition. Again, for $90 a night this is a 3 stars, but for $300 is really not good value for money.","London, United Kingdom","Lovecraft</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",83,2.0

The positives were I was able to checkin on arrival at approx 11 am however I had to fight to get my room above the 8th floor as promised by my travel agent. I paid extra for a partial ocean view. On entering my room I have to say I was a little disappointed it was not quite as grand as the website photos indicated. I did not have a balcony. The bathroom was extremely small with the door only just clearing the toilet. Also the bath enamel was missing in several large chunks. I had paid $293 a night and was expecting something a bit more upmarket. The lift area is very tatty and resembles a 2 star hotel. I travel a lot for work in Australia and usually stay in 3-4 star hotels this was more like 2.5 star. On the good side the room was clean, the sheets were changed after 4 days not 3 as stated in the brochure. Air con was very noisy.Staff at the front desk were friendly and polite. I can't recommend the tour desk in the foyer as they charge well over the price for excursions to tourist sites like Pearl Harbour and do not pick you up at the Hotel but at a hotel further across the road this wasn't mentioned until after I had booked.I was on the 11th floor and it was extremely noisy although funnily enough I didn't mind this it adds to the excitement of Waikik. Wifi in the room was excellent and if being within a 15 minutes walk to the Ala Moana shopping Center is important then maybe you can overlook the other shortcomings. Personally I would expect more for my money and will do little more research next time I stay in Waikiki.","New York City, New York","Sheilathefox</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",17,3.0

The staff had told us to meet him at a certain spot, that we clearly did not know which area they were talking about. We were in an open parking lot next to Nordstrom which would have been very easy to locate us and pick us up.We knew what the shuttle looked like from the picture at the hotel.We waited about 20 minutes, we went to the second level of Ala Moana, thinking he might be waiting up on the second level. We decided to call the hotel again, and wanted to see what was going on.The staff had told us, that the driver was trying to look for us, but couldn't find us. Later he told us that the driver was driving a grey VIP transit van, which we were clearly were not informed about this. Next he told us that the driver would have to come back in 20 minutes, but we figured that it takes 20 minutes to walk to the hotel, so we decided to walk instead.We were extremely upset by this.I am aware that hotels do make mistakes, but it is important to display professionalism and organization in a business.

When I got to the new room, my suitcase was actually there already which was nice but then I discovered that the new room had a sliding door that opened right to the pool and that door was not locked. This made me upset because anyone could have walked into my room from the pool and stolen my things. My first day at the hotel, the pool was open but then they closed it and never reopened it for the other two days that I was at the hotel. At check-out time I asked for a discount of the resort fee which is in addition to the hotel nightly rate. The woman at the front desk told me that the resort fee had nothing to do with the pool and that it was for the complimentary shuttle and ice water (not bottled) at the front desk. No one ever told them there was a complimentary shuttle nor did I ever see it. I am in a wheelchair and asked if the shuttle was accessible. She stated yes but since I never saw it , I cannot confirm this. Lastly, I made my reservation for hotel on the hotel's own website and paid for it with my credit card in full. When I checked in I was told that they were going to put a $100 hold on my other credit card to cover any possible charges (which is odd since they don't even have a restaurant or spa) I made to my room but when I checked my credit card they had actually put a much large hold on my credit. They put a hold for the cost of my entire stay. This made no since to me as I was under the impression that I had already paid for the room with another credit card on their own website. When I questioned the hotel they told me that on my original credit card they had actually only charged me for one night and I still owed the other nights. When I showed them my print out that appeared to show paid in full they pointed to very small print at the bottom that stated that they only actually charged me for one night at that point. This seems like a very inefficient and misleading way to do it. When you make your reservation it makes it seem like you have actually been charged the complete stay but you actually haven't and get charged the remainder at the hotel.","Houston, Texas","viajes001</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",16,2.0

The room was clean and had a nice view. We checked out on Saturday to tour some of the other islandsWe returned the following Saturday for four more days and that is when thing went really down hill. We notice upon arrival in our room that things were a bit warm so we adjusted the thermostat to a cooler temperature and went on about our day.

On Sunday I reported to the front desk that it appeared as though the air conditioner was having a problem early the next morning. They sent maintenance who checked things told me the reset the thermostat and that it should take care of the problem. We went to bed and got up the next morning to find it even warmer than the night before.On Monday, I once again reported to the front desk that the air conditioner wasn't working. Again they sent someone to reset the thermostat. This time they told me they would also check on the chiller on the roof. Again when we got up the next morning it was warmer than when we went to bed the night before.On Tuesday I again informed the front desk around 7 am that there was still a problem. I was told that maintenance would look at it as soon as they got in and that the manager would give me a call. I returned to the room around 5 pm and it was still too warm. Around 5:30, 2 maintenance men finally showed up, checked where the thermostat was set and told me that I needed to expect the temperature to be around 75 degrees. And the manager never contacted me.On my way out for dinner I stopped at the desk again and was finally offered a different room. Since I was checking out the next morning I declined to move at 9 pm.Upon checkout I once again let the desk clerk know that I was unhappy with the handling of the problem. I was told that I could expect a phone call from the manager once I got home. Long story short is that I've now been home for 2 weeks and have not heard a word from the manager.

There was no room to swing anything and my idea of a holiday of a lifetime is not to sleep on a fold out couch for 8 nights. Of course I gave my daughter the bed. The state of the room was old and dated chipped and dirty and considering I had saved for years, and travelled a day to get there, I was incredibly disappointed.

We are a Kama'aina family and my husband had a Union conference on Monday 9/22/14 and we thought it would be fun to make a weekend out of it. The conference was held at The Ala Moana Hotel, however the room prices there were ridiculous and with a small child (he's 4) their pool is not suited for young children. After researching several properties in the close proximity of the Ala Moana area, I stumbled upon The Aqua Palms. I read the reviews (more positive than negative) and looked at the photos online and price compared to other properties and we decided to give them a try. The main thing that sold us were the pictures of the quaint, child friendly (not deep) pool which showed a CRYSTAL clear and BLUE water pool. We also pleased to see there were a lot of choices for dining within walking distance. Since my husband would be gone all Monday it was important for me to be able to take our son swimming in a pool and not having to walk to a beach. I reserved a City View room. We were all set. As I continued to read reviews up until the day before our arrival, I sent a message via Tripadvisor and requested if possible a room upgrade to the ""ocean view"" room facing the Hilton Hawaiian Village and above the 9th floor (as most reviews said you heard less street noise in rooms higher up) The General Manager graciously said she would put our request in and try to accommodate us. We were pleasantly surprised we got a free upgrade to a ""partial ocean view"" room on the 10th floor. The room was adequate & clean (carpets still damp from being shampooed) but the bathroom was a joke. The door grazes the toilet bowl and you cannot get in the tub without closing the door & awkwardly squeezing yourself between the toilet and sink. We walked out onto our balcony and looked down at the pool and was shocked to see the water murky, dark and GREEN. You could not even see the bottom of the pool and could see a ""film"" on top of the water. Since my son was all waiting all week to swim and because we are in the middle of a heat wave with hot, humid weather , we went down to investigate and to our shock the water looked even worse up close. There was NO MOVEMENT, water smelt stagnant and was definitely green. My son stepped in, my husband followed, I refused. After about 10 mins I told them to get out as it did not look sanitary. I spoke to another family who had been there 10 days already and they stated that the pool was not working the week prior to this but was told it was fixed however the last time they saw it ""CLEAR and BLUE"" was Friday, hello this was now SUNDAY!!! It was evident that the pump was not filtering the water. I went downstairs and spoke to the Bellman and also the Front Desk they both stated that the Maintenance Dept. would look into it. Maintenance radioed back (I could hear) and stated that everything was working but the pump needed time to ""do it's job"" . On Monday morning I got up went outside to see the pool water was not green, but it was not crystal clear either. It was still murky, looked a little better and I could see the bottom a little but it was still not was a normal working pool water should look like. I then called and left a message with the G.M. and she called back explaining that the pump was in fact working, that they closed the pool early on Sunday night (7:45 pm) so that they could retreat and flush the water. Why would they need to do that when the pool closed at 10:00 pm anyway, what would an extra 2 1/2 hours do if in fact pump was working properly. I told her what we witnessed the day prior and seeing it this morning and that there was not even a smell of chlorine while we were there yesterday. She assured me the pump was operational and the pool was safe to swim in. She also stated that ""sometimes on the weekend due to heavy use there is buildup"" Who is she kidding, uhhh we stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki and most recently at the Hilton Waikoloa both 5 star hotels, whose pools are used by 100's if not 1000's of people daily, even more on the weekends and never...never did their pool look like the Aqua Palms. I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and took my son downstairs to swim. The water looked and smelled better than the day before but it was still by far not what the pictures on this site and others portray. We were and are very disappointed. This hotel houses many military families pcs'g in and out, we spoke with several who shared lots of problems they were dealing with during their stay not to mention the pool. Overall the room was clean and adequate the staff was awesome. (excluding the Maintenance staff, we didn't see one our entire stay) For the price it was ok, would we stay here again??? Maybe!!!! They need to start being honest with guests about the problems they are having with equipment and renovations that cause all 3 elevators to be closed down one day (causing a young military family NOT MINE to hike up 12 flights with 2 small children and a stroller)...That is unacceptable!!! In the meantime spending about $20.00 -$30.00 more I could have stayed at a more reliable property with a little better amenities. Makes me irritated to think that the G.M. thought by upgrading our room that somehow made the pool situation ok. Well if the room we stayed in was an upgrade I hate to see what the ""regular"" rooms look like...","Kapolei, United States","Keone M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kapolei, United States</strong>",5,3.0

The building is older but reasonably well maintained.

The king bed was fairly comfortable except for the huge overstuffed pillows. There was a decent selection of TV channels, and WiFi worked well. Unfortunately our room overlooked a construction site, so we were awakened by crashing and banging at 7:30 each morning. The air conditioning system took a long time to cool down the room but maintained the temperature once it got there. The shower stall was sized appropriately for a 10-year-old child; an average sized adult will find it cramped.Since this was a working trip for us, we did not have time to visit the pool so I am unable to comment on that facility.If you plan to park a car at the Aqua Palms, I recommend a smaller vehicle.

But it did have a partial ocean view between the Hawaiian Hilton Village and iIlikai across the street, and a view of Diamond Head in the distance…. quite nice to sit on the balcony and enjoy a glass of wine out there in the evening. The room (#906) was small and a weird layout…. walk down a small hall to the little kitchenette (nice to have the refrigerator and microwave) and a small dresser which blocked the way to the dining table next to the desk and then the bed. All cramped in there… but it was there. The shampoo/soaps were all nice… earth friendly and papaya smelling, but the bathroom itself was lacking. Small and outdated. The bed was ok. The pillows were so uncomfortable and hard that I didn't sleep all week. The room had no phone numbers for front desk or services, so when the toilet stopped up there's was no one to call. I had to go down to the front desk. Again, a friendly staff that took care of it.The location is good to get out of town.

The room was clean, modern and great for the price I paid (which was at the lower end of the expensive!). I only ever really use hotels as a place to sleep, so I can't speak by way of amenities, but it's definitely somewhere I would book into again.

We were allowed to check in early, and our sofa bed was already made up and waiting for us which was lovely because I've been to and worked in plenty of hotels that will simply tell you ""The extra blanket is in the closet"" and leave you to make the bed yourself, so walking in and seeing it ready even with us being there a little early was fantastic!The staff were all super friendly and welcoming, no matter who we spoke to.

Snooze on beach and then early check in which wasn't a problem and no charge. Staff are terrific and very helpful. Johnny at concierge is a gem. Room clean tidy and bed very comfortable.

We booked a package through their website for a room with breakfast included (from the IHOP downstairs), which worked out wonderfully, as it meant that we didn't need to add the cost of breakfast every day (which can work out reasonably expensive in somewhere like Honolulu).Our room was clean, tidy and had a nice view of Diamond Head, with a partial view of the water. We were on the 10th floor, so it was also pretty quiet, and you didn't get much street noise. The location is a little out of the ""main stretch"" of Waikiki, but in a way that's quite nice, because you don't get all the craziness, and it allowed us to walk off all the food and drinks we had!This hotel was a great option for us for the price - and with the location there were car rental places nearby, The Bus (Honolulu's transportation system) was right outside. There were also lots of restaurants within a 5-10min walk.The staff were very friendly, knowledgeable and suprised us with a lovely note and present for our honeymoon when we arrived. They also knew where best to buy things, and also the easiest way to get around (The Bus is amazingly simple to use!).","Sydney, Australia","KatieA978</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",13,4.0

My husband and I decide to stay here instead of Hawaiian Hilton because it's cheaper and also it's just a road away from Hilton. I'm glad we did. The staff was friendly and helpful especially the reception staffwhom I often turned to for directions around Oahu. Breakfast was provided as well which was pretty good: we were given choices of oatmeal, French toast or pancakes with sausages at the IHOP restaurant every morning. The restaurant serves pretty good food as well though I prefer Wailana cafe which was just a 2-3 min walk away. I highly recommend Wailana especially if you are staying here or at Hilton. They serve delicious food! The room that we stayed was 824 and it was on the 8th floor with the partial ocean view. Well the view wasn't that great as it was blocked by Hilton. I'm not that particular as we don't stay in the room long anyway. The bed was a huge king size bed which was comfy and clean with a big LG tv on the wall facing the bed. The channels on the tv were pretty good as well. I watched quite a number of movies and South Park on it. There was a sofa next to the bed which was quite comfortable but it was slightly torn though. The bathroom was decent, it was not as big as I had hoped but it was good enough. Bath and face towels were provided as well as toiletries. Our room was cleaned everyday by the housekeeper who I had a brief talk to. Can't remember her name though but she was a cheery lady and she gave us new towels and toiletries everyday which we were very pleased about. Overall we had a good stay because of the staff and also we were happy with our room. Also it is in a good location- really near Waikiki beach, Ala Moana center and also the bus stop was just outside the hotel which was really good as many buses stop by at this bus stop.","Singapore, Singapore","MaddyMadeline</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",7,5.0

Later that day I asked if it was possible to have a room with a balcony for the rest of our stay, and we were told that it was ok, however we had to bacate our room by 12 as if it were a normal check out and go back at 3 to check in the new room...it was a bit of an inconvenience but it was worth it to have a balcony.

Breakfast in the ihop was ok, just ok, edible.It is true that the hotel is a bit dated, but it's clean, good price and good location.

The day before we asked for a late check aou and we were told that we can stay till 1pm if there is availability, or we could pay 79 dollars and stay till 6pm but they told us to ask the day after. On the day we were leaving we asked for the late checkout, we were willing to pay the 79 dollars but the receptionist wasn't very friendly and said that the hotel was full ( vacancy light was on) and that we had to leave by 12, but when he realised we were asking for a paid late check out he changed his mind and he said that it was ok if we were paying...so, the hotel is full if you want to check out one hour late, but if you pay to check out 6 hours late is not full...we thought that we shouldn't pay for the late check out die to the lack of consistency from the hotel.But all in all, we still had a great stay, we know that you get what you pay for and you can't expect a five stars hotel at this price.

We were searching for reasons to stay away from the hotel rather than using our room as a haven from the hustle of Waikiki- a real shame.",bournemouth,"dotkate</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>bournemouth</strong>",2,1.0

There were 9 of us in total with 3 rooms booked.The hotel is located in a convenient location within easy walking distance to the beaches, Duke Kahanamoku lagoon, Ala Moana Shopping Centre, and downtown Waikiki . We could actually see both the ocean and Diamond Head from our rooms. The rooms themselves were a little dated but clean. I'd recommend ear plugs as the air conditioner was a little on the noisy side, and the pull out beds were not the most comfortable. The swimming pool area was nicely maintained with plenty of lounge chairs and provided a place for our family to unwind in the evening (when not watching the sunset on Waikiki Beach).The bell service at the hotel was very friendly and attentive, and helped us with tips for when we were driving around the island, and with arranging our transportation to Pearl Harbor and the airport when we left for Kauai. The front desk service was also friendly and efficient. Don't forget to get your beach/pool towel cards when checking in.They give a 10% discount for breakfasts at the attached IHOP, but I'd recommend the Wailana Coffee House diner just down the street on the corner as a much better option with better prices. If you go there, ask for the macadamia nut pancakes. They're not actually listed on the menu but are available. The all-you-can eat pancakes with eggs and bacon was only $6.65 plus an extra $1.25 or so for the macadamia nuts. Delicious with the coconut syrup! On the Friday night that we were there, we walked to the lagoon and watched a great fireworks show that the Hilton Hawaiian Village displays each Friday at 7:45 pm. After that, we went back to our room. Al little while later, we heard a large bang and looked out the window. They were setting off a second round of fireworks. This time we watched from our balcony and could see most of the show fine from there since we were on the 9th floor. I'm not sure if they always do two shows or if this was an exception, but we really enjoyed it. The one negative with our stay here occurred on the last day. Our flight out of Honolulu was not until the evening, so we had our transportation arranged to pick us up at the hotel at 5:15 pm. We had asked about the possibility of having a late check out time (approx 4 - 5 pm) so we could keep our luggage readily available to us, have a last shower if we headed to the beach/pool, etc. When we were checking out in the morning, the vacancy sign was lit up, but we were told that none of our rooms would be available for a late check out. However, we could pay $79 to keep a room for the day, which my parents decided to do and we chipped in. My brother and his immediate family, and my immediate family then checked out of our respective rooms. We went out for breakfast and returned later and headed to the front desk to ask for from beach towels since my wife, son and I wanted to hit the beach one last time. The clerk's initial response was, ""You already checked out."" She had been present when we had earlier been arranging for my parents to keep their room for the day. So I reminded her that, yes, we checked out, but my parents had paid for a room for the remainder of the day, so she agreed to let us have some towels. Really, the hotel may have been well within their rights to no longer provide service to any of us other than my parents, but come on - you received 15 paid days from our family, and we just wanted to borrow some towels. I was kind of surprised by this since we were treated so well beforehand. Anyway, I considered making this a 3-star review, but I don't think that would be fair based on the rest of our experience. I only include it here for the benefit of hotel management to consider ensuring all staff are aware of the benefits of ""going the extra mile"".Mahalo","Charlottetown, Canada","StormBean</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charlottetown, Canada</strong>",20,4.0

I spent a lot of time researching hotels in Waikiki and I didn't want to buy into the big chains and their ridiculous resort fees so I picked the Aqua Palms and we were very happy with my decision. Breakfast being included in the price is important to us also so to have this was fantastic! Getting to the beach is a short stroll across through the Hilton Hawaiian village and we found a great spot at the lagoon that has plenty of shade to shelter from the strong sun rays. We walked into Waikiki every night except for one night when we went to ala moana and we were not impressed, it's like being in an overpriced Florida mall and even though we found a great sushi restaurant, we walked back to the hotel through a road filled with sex shops/lap dancing clubs and were approached by a few homeless people. I wouldn't recommend walking up to ala moana sc unless you are on a shopping mission. The bars /restaurants down in Waikiki are fantastic! And some great happy hour deals on food and drink!! We loved the managers reception at your hotel, 'sway' was definitely up there with Mai tais as my favorite Hawaiian cocktail. We booked a partial ocean view room and we were on the 11th floor and it had a stunning view. Great view of diamond head also! The pool are was very clean and perfect for us also. The only thing which I would like to suggest is perhaps a parasol or two around the pool for us sun smart people! It was hard to find somewhere in the shade by the pool. The beach towels which you provide are a great asset also! We didn't know that and packed our beach towels so this was fantastic that we didn't have to reuse our beach towels every day and were able to get fresh ones every morning.

I really hope to come back (and bring the rest of my family) so hope the proposed renovations do not mean a price hike! I loved all the thoughtful and practical amenities in the room. We stayed 10 nights in Feb in a twin bedded room on the 7th floor, with full lanai, the ""Diamond Head View"" which looks onto the Hilton Village across the road so you can see partial views of the ocean and Fri night fireworks, and Diamond Head. What we loved: Super location -The Bus stop right outside the front door so you can get to Pearl Harbor for $2.50, and the Tapa Towers Bus Depot (walk through path in gardens in Hilton complex)is just across the road for your pickup for Paradise Cove, Polynesian Cultural Centre and other day trips. Your airport shuttle will come right to this hotel and the lobby is one of its best features - friendly, tables, chairs & sofas, free apples, coffee and iced water and is the place for fun Manager's reception party every Thursday night - free cocktails and chips & dips and live band! More about location: right across the road for start of Waikiki beach. Easy walks to free Army museum; Ala Moana shops, lots of restaurants also the great Fabric Mart. The Palms has a fast easy checkout. The staff are super friendly and helpful and quick to respond if you need more coffee or clean towels. Everything was clean and nice, the sheets were beautifully crisp. More of what we loved: SUPER comfortable beds - must have invested in top quality mattresses. Also: full length mirror in main room (great for 3 gals in room); iron & ironing board;s proper coathangers; roomy bathroom with quite long vanity benchtop; microwave; filter coffee maker;( for breakfast in your room just buy some disposable plates etc). Table & chairs as well as desk; more chairs & table on lanai; beachtowels and beach chairs on loan for free, you get a special card for this; air conditioning works well. 3 elevators work well and fast. Used the pool a couple of times when we wanted a quick dip before going out. There is a BBQ too. From the pool you can see the fireworks - there were fireworks on Tues & Thurs as well - maybe another hotel in addition to the Hilton? Anyways be sure to get in quick by 7:00pm at the Hilton lagoon pool for the great show before the fireworks start at 7:45pm sharp Fridays. The beach gets packed! The rates at the Palms are reasonable because they do not have room service which I would never use anyway. Win! There are plenty of places to eat nearby and the ABC stores have great fresh sandwiches etc. if you want a quick snack to save time. The only issue I can think of was some inconsistent housekeeping - on our last night we came back to our room at 3:30pm and it hadn't been serviced yet which was disappointing as we wanted clean towels etc. before going out again. So we just organised clean towels and coffee refills. Another day we returned in the afternoon to find the bathroom light on, no bathmat and the pillows not yet arranged, and the sliding door to the lanai wide open as though the maid had been interrupted. I conclude that she had run out of bathmats and had gone to get some and forgot to come back to finish our room. No harm done, human error, we were 7 floors up thankfully. We just found the late cleaning of room inconvenient as we would often like to go out in the morning then come back to a cleaned room for a power nap before heading out again. Maybe the 12:00 checkout all makes the housekeeping timetable late all round. I'm just used to 10:00am checkout. We liked the cute palm them décor, I sincerely hope renovations do change anything too much. We're saving up to come back! Aussies this is a great value friendly hotel but bear in mind there are no more than 2 beds in each room.

If you want to be close to the mall stay there. If you want to be close to central Waikiki stay at the Aqua Wave. Otherwise it's a $8 cab ride to get to a better beach where the surfing is and all the restaurants are. It's not too too far of a walk though if you don't mind walking with all of your stuff for staying on budget. This is a great hotel. By far the best staff for friendliness and helpfulness.

The shower head needed to be replaced as there was hardly any water coming out.There is a small kitchen cabinet with a microwave and a refrigerator there too.Housekeeping was good and efficient. The restocking of bathroom amenities was rather interesting as some days we got only shampoo, other days we got shampoo and conditioner and then on two occasions we got also bath gel. Every day we got a different brand, it looked like that they were trying to finish up old products.Room had free wi-fi, which was a big plus.We booked a room with partial ocean view and when you book a room of this category our higher you have breakfast included. The hotel itself does not have a restaurant, You are issued breakfast vouchers for the adjacent IHOP restaurant. There you have 3 options. Unfortunately the service at the restaurant was not that great. I assume that the service staff was not too worried since the gratuity was already covered by the voucher. They have a coffee machine in the lobby 24 hours a day and during the main day hours there is also free water. There is also a basket with apples at the front desk.Parking is, as noted by other reviewers, kind of difficult at first. We had to check in first to get our room key to open the gate to the garage, but after that it was pretty easy. I would not recommend to rent a large car as some of the spaces in the garage and the ramps with its curves are rather tight. Parking is $25 a day with in and out privileges.We would probably stay there again, because of its price-value. If the hotel was more expensive it would not be worth it. Also the staff needs to make sure that when guests are booking a package everything is ready at check in. The guests should not have to inquire for 4 days before the problem is being solved..","San Diego, California","Nola76</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",32,3.0

In the lobby was a gentleman who sold tours. We made arrangements with him to visit Pearl Harbor. This was so nice, because the service picked us up and dropped us off at the front door.

As noted by other reviewers, the hotel's location makes it a great choice for anyone interested in the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. We walked to the beach at Fort DeRussy Beach Park and went to the military museum there. We also took advantage of the dining options at the Hilton Hawaiian Village across the street. I was really impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff at the Aqua Palms. Everyone, from the housekeeping staff to the bell man to the front desk staff, greeted us daily and offered advice when asked. A front desk employee pointed us to the Shore Bird at one of the Outrigger properties for breakfast... It was perfect! A different front desk employee directed us to the beach at Fort DeRussy. The kindness and politeness of every employee we encountered made us feel welcome and comfortable during our stay. I agree with other reviewers that the parking lot is very tight and a little dangerous (parking was $25/night). However, there are so many buses and trolleys to take you to some of the main attractions that you may not need a car. I also agree with other reviewers that this is not really a boutique hotel.

The rooms are fairly big and clean, but not every room has a balcony, as we had to learn (response from the receptionist: ""Why would you think so?""). Again, their website is misleading. If you want a balcony, request one. There was also a construction site in the back, but it was quiet at night. In a nutshell, there's nothing wrong with this place.

Agree with other reviewers, all staff are very friendly and accommodating. Proximity, (walking distance), to both Ala Moana Shopping complex and the beach are a big plus plus for us.

Problem arose when we were informed on our first stay that the hotel does not store bags for returning guests. We were advised to use their recommended third party service or store the bags at the airport. Various excuses were made why they couldn't store bags overnight and none being the same from those we inquired. So if either of the aforementioned bag storage options are not a problem or inconvenience, this hotel could be an option for your stay in Honolulu. Each time we were given high floor ""city view"" rooms which were clean and nicely appointed with a comfortable king bed, big screen TV, microwave, coffee maker and mini-frig. The problem here was that the hotel never mentioned the 2 buildings under construction directly behind the hotel. Anyone wanting to sleep past 7:00 AM will find it almost impossible with the noise of hammering and movement of construction equipment. While I fully understand that the Aqua Palms Hotel has no control over this construction, they are aware of it and in turn, could advise guests of this situation. As the ""Vacancy"" sign was up, guests could have been given another room location option(s) other than ""city view"", even without asking. As for the hotel's location, it's very good. The westbound downtown Honolulu bus stop was some 30 yards to the right from the front door and the eastbound returning stop was 3 minutes away across Ala Moana and down Kalia St. A tip: If you're traveling light (small carry-on suitcase/bag) take the #19 or #20 bus from the airport departure area ( 2nd floor) at the bus stop across the street from the building. The ride is $2.50/adult, $1.50/child and only $1.00 for seniors with a Medicare Card. After 50-60 minutes, get off at the Kalia St. stop by the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Another interesting thing happened that never occurred before at any of our other extensive hotel stays, either in the U.S. or overseas. In her Thursday night manager's reception, the hotel manager blatantly solicited favorable Trip Advisor reviews when addressing attendees in her welcome spiel. In summary, it was an OK stay at the Aqua Palms Waikiki but that's the best I would rate the stay. For those only staying in Honolulu and not using it as a home base to visit the other islands, you should find the hotel sufficient for your needs. Will we stay here again?

This was a repeat visit for me and I found the hotel to be in good condition and conveniently located to the things that I wanted to see. My only concern was for a tray in the room that was on the counter above the refrigerator. It was not clean and when I moved it several very small bugs came out from the wood that was around the tray. This was very unpleasant and I quickly placed the tray outside of my room with a note telling housekeeping to not put a tray back in my room. If these trays are in all of the rooms at the Aqua Palms Management should remove them because apparently they are a good hiding place for bugs. Also, it does appear that this hotel needs some newer furniture. A cabinet in the room looked like something that should be placed in the used furniture dump. This being said, the rest of the furniture in the room was adequate. The bed, bedding,towels were clean and well kept. Overall cleanliness in the room was good. All staff are helpful and housekeeping staff are very accommodating. I did not hear very much noise in the hallway or from adjacent rooms which is a plus!

I called the front desk and they moved me across the hallway. normally, I wouldn't even make a fuss, but they put me in another room that was cleaned by the SAME housekeeper.

The ac worked well, very good water pressure with plenty of HOT water. There is some apartments being built nearby, so, you will hear construction noise during the day, but, who cares, we were out most of the day, doing fun things in Hawaii! The walls and windows provide great sound proofing. It is nice to have a fridge and microwave in the room.

Our stay here has been so enjoyable and with the free wifi in-room I thought I would take the time to write a review now. Value for money, clean and friendly staff. We had our weekly 'Sway' night yesterday. Lovely refreshing cocktail after a hot day at the beach. Room - I booked a City View room with 2 queen size beds. Bathroom was clean and beds comfortable. Slightly on the small side but really we didn't mind as we were only there to sleep and with comfortable beds, I really didn't care much. Places to eat - with the Hilton Village across the road you really don't have to stray too far to find somewhere to eat. We haven't had any meals as such yet, but will probably before we leave. Also easy access through to the beach by walking through the Hilton. If you need caffeine, there are several Starbucks located in there. Shopping - if you love shopping like we do, Ala Moana centre is a big big mall and is only 12 mins walk away from the hotel. There's Macy's in there, Nordstrom and so much more. Hilton Village also has lots of little stores in there to shop. Another shopping strip is Kalakaua Avenue. There's Sephora, Ralph Lauren, Victoria Secrets, Tiffany's and others. This hotel is just a great location as you get to access all of these within a short walk.So far no complaints, we're absolutely enjoying our stay here at the Aqua Palms Waikiki.

This hotel is perhaps a 10 minute walk, at most, from the Waikiki Beach/shops, etc. A nice and safe walk on the streets, the beach would take a bit longer. It is directly across the street from the Hilton, and using that beach was easy and beautiful. We chose a higher floor, 8th, with partial ocean/Diamond Head view. Definitely go higher..there was some traffic noise, but nothing that interfered with sleeping. The view was nice, but worth the extra dollars, I am not certain. We saw the beach and Diamond head from a thousand other places and we we didn't spend enough time in the room to enjoy it! The parking garage is tiny. Even parking our compact car was challenging at times. $25 a night to park, which I guess is pretty much the going rate. Our rate included a select breakfast at the attached IHop, which was very good. The front desk, and all who worked there were very pleasant and helpful. Fresh ice water and fruit in the lobby, and a informal gathering Thursday night with apps and their yummy sway drink in the lobby. The room was beautiful, roomy, with a comfortable bed, nice hairdryer, refrigerator, ironing board. I couldn't have asked for more. We had been checking out hotels for months before we chose, and at that time we signed up for their email specials. About 6 weeks before our vacation we got an email with a special rate that was considerably less than advertised rate on the varied websites.

That said, I had a short solo stay in Waikiki and I grabbed a quick night (at a fairly good price) at the Aqua Palms Hotel (and Spa?) and I was really disappointed, even with little expectation going in.Frankly, the hotel is in dire need of a renovation as it appears they have used the ""lipstick"" maintenance method for many years beyond its usefulness. The facility and rooms are dirty, broken, worn, smelly, loud and in an overall state of distress. While I was staying alone for a business stop, I would have been truly disappointed if this stay was supposed to fulfill a ""vacation"" accommodation, despite the excellent location right off the beach.I would avoid the hotel until you can confirm a bonafide renovation.

We booked a partial ocean view with 2 queen beds but were given a room with one queen and one pull-out bed. This was despite me reiterating at check-in that we booked 2 queen beds, but they were apparently out of such rooms. The pull-out was really uncomfortable and whoever slept on it (we rotated) woke up with a headache the next morning.The PowerPoint in the bathroom (room 1204) didn't work and we had to plug the hair dryer in a PowerPoint in main room to use it. Also, the wifi didn't connect. They sent up the technician and he fixed it, but it only stayed fixed for 5 minutes or so. It seemed like it kept shorting out. I ended up unplugging the wifi connection in our room and then it worked perfectly (I assume I was using the wifi signal from the next room). I suspect there is a problem with the electrics in this room.However, the room itself was a good size, the view from the balcony was nice, we had a fridge, a microwave and a coffee maker plus some cutlery and crockery which was great. The tv was good with a decent number of cable channels. Housekeeping also did a great job.It is about a 10-15 min walk to the International Marketplace and a less than 10 min walk in the opposite direction to Ala Moana shopping centre. It is only a few minutes walk to the beach (in front of the Hilton Hawaiian Village).There are numerous restaurants nearby and iHop is downstairs. I was not advised when we checked in that we were entitled to a free breakfast at iHop every morning, and I didn't find this out until our last night so we unfortunately bought breakfast elsewhere every morning (Snappers has a yummy $3.99 breakfast). The iHop breakfast wasn't on the website when I booked so maybe it was introduced after I booked (even though the room was the same price as what I paid) and perhaps I wasn't entitled to it which is why they didn't mention it? I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an economical alternative to the Hilton Hawaiian Village, as you are in a similar location, can use the lagoon but pay less than half what you'd pay at the Hilton.Parking is expensive, so on the days I booked a rental car to drive to the North Shore I picked the car up in the morning and returned it that night to avoid paying for parking. I used Dollar (on Kalakaua Ave) and Hertz (in Hilton).

Parking costs $25/night with a cramped garage - be careful on the turns.

We booked the Aqua Palms for July 20-22 before flying on to Maui,and I chose the hotel after previously staying at Aqua Ilikai Hotel, also in Honolulu, last September. I chose the Aqua Palm for the price and location, both of which were good for peak season in Honolulu (mid- to late-July). However, the air conditioning is terrible. Not just a little inadequate -- truly awful. The humidity level in our room was extraordinarily high, easily 70 percent. When I reported it to the front desk late the first night, the staff member gave me a fan to use until maintenance could fix the AC. Thank goodness for the fan or I don't think we could have slept at all.The next morning, I put in another request for maintenance to check the AC and to open the broken safe in our room. A maintenance staff member came to our room right away, but when I mentioned the AC, he sheepishly admitted that no one would be fixing it. I was left with the impression it was either too costly a fix or not a priority because it was a major system problem. The halls are cooler than the rooms, possibly because they have separate wall units. Too bad they can't add those in the rooms. We kept the fan and limped through our second night, but after we took showers and packed the next morning, we were so sweaty and hot that we couldn't get out of the Aqua Palms fast enough. I found the front desk staff to be kind and sympathetic about the lack of air conditioning. The front desk area was sweltering, too. As compensation for our discomfort, the $25/day self-parking fee was deducted from our bill. At $200/night, it probably wasn't really enough for how miserable we were, but I just wanted to leave. If you can handle no air conditioning, then this hotel is probably OK for you. It's not fancy, but it's passable. We liked the location, but if you're only in Honolulu for a few days, you can probably just stay further out from Waikiki and save money that way. If I had known about the AC problems before I booked, I would have gone elsewhere.One more thing: I'm not sure this hotel has an option for two double beds.

We stayed at the Aqua Palms Waikiki. It was slightly under $300. nightly and $25. daily for parking. When we first arrived we paniced because there is ""a lot"" of traffic and congestion and their sign(like all others is tiny. We had to park in front of the lobby and partially on the sidewalk after having missed it 2 or three times even using a GPS. Once we checked in we had to drive a very, very high incline in order to get to the extremely tight parking garage. Parking in and out was very challenging. On one day of our 8 day stay they ran out of water for about 32 hours. We had returned tired and sweaty and could not clean ourselves. In the morning they still had not fixed the water. The rooms were okay and clean but quite older accomodations. We had a small partial view across the street of the ocean and our patio was tiny with one chair missing and fabric on remaining chair worn of sun rot. The staff was fairly friendly. One redeeming value was there were many places nearby to eat and tons and tons of ABC convenience stores. Their pool was pretty small and they have one small barbecue grill. Their exercise room was fair but no fans with one eliptical machine and one treadmil and very limited free weights. If it wasn't that it WAS Waikiki, I would say that it was well over priced but the Hilton across the street is substantially more. If you are on a limited budget this is okay if not, do not go there as you do not get much for your money.","Colorado Springs, Colorado","Manuel S G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colorado Springs, Colorado</strong>",8,3.0

Found the Aqua Palms through an internet search for a hotel. Since we have already taken numerous trips this year and more to come I was trying to go as inexpensive as possible. My husband is a bit of a hotel snob and wasn't happy we weren't staying at a resort. He was however happy when he saw the price and went along with my choice. I called the hotel a couple days before and was assisted in making transportation arrangements and planning our trip while we were there. All very easy. After a horrible trip over from Arizona we were so happy to walk into a large, comfortable room. Plenty of space for our 6 day stay. It's right across from a major resort that we were able to take advantage of as if we were staying there. The trolly stops right in front of the hotel for drop off and across the street for pick up. The hotel gave us a map and helped direct us on how to use the trolly which was simple actually. The room is very clean and we actually liked being able to walk out onto the balcony and see all the hustle and bustle. We still had a great view of the ocean and once we closed the door all noise was completely shut out. Every time I called the front desk they answered right away. They give free use of beach towels and chairs which the resort charges a fee for. May need updating in the future, but I think it is fine at this time. We used the laundry facilities while we were there and all was good. Did not use the pool, but noticed many young children there. Ours are older so we hit the beach instead. We were very happy with our stay and would recommend it to those not wanting to spend a lot and still get the use of a resort. The only reason I am not giving this hotel a 5 point rating is that their wifi is horrible. I was not able to use at all. I used my hot spot instead. If this isn't important to you then I would say it's a great place to stay. Aloha!","Mesa, Arizona","Bernice S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mesa, Arizona</strong>",4,4.0

We got a great online deal for a Partial Ocean View Lanai room at Aqua Palms. It was the best rate that I found for hotels in Waikiki on the days that we were there! We had a view of Diamond Head and the ocean. Aqua Palms Waikiki is right across the street from the Hilton Village. We were only there for 3 days at 2 nights, but I loved the location. It was about a 7-10 minute walk to the beach and it's far away enough from the night-life/commotion of luxury row and the downtown area (we got great sleep at the Aqua Palms!).I was impressed with the service from the moment we arrived. Our flight got in from Japan around 0730 and we arrived to the hotel by 0845. Even though check-in isn't until 3pm, our room was ready and we were welcomed warmly. Because we were celebrating our anniversary, we were upgraded to a room on the penthouse floor. It was awesome getting to stay on the top floor! The view was great and the room was very quiet. The Partial Ocean View rooms are quite spacious. Upon entering, there was a little ""hallway"" with a closet; the bathroom had double sinks and a separate area for the toilet; then another door separated the actual bedroom (which included sleeping area, table with two chairs, small wet bar, and the lanai). The hotel provides towels and beach chairs for guests to use free of charge during their stay. They also provided great maps and recommendations for places to eat and places to visit. After our first day out, we were surprised to find an anniversary gift from hotel management -- chocolate covered macadamia nuts and a bottle of champagne! It was so thoughtful and a great touch. On Thursdays there is a manager's reception with live music, light snacks, and a signature cocktail. We really enjoyed this! It was also a nice, value-add that the hotel has. We didn't have any problem with the wifi connection -- which is always very important! It worked great!A short 5 minute walk gets you to Hale Koa (the military hotel). The Hale Koa was booked when we were in Waikiki, but it was nice being close to it in order to use the NEX and other military amenities. We went ""downtown"" for eating and shopping both nights that we were in Waikiki. The walk was approximately 30 minutes, but it was an easy/pleasant walk. We could have taken the bus, but the weather was really nice and the walk is actually enjoyable. If you don't want to make the walk, there are a lot of places to eat and things to do around the hotel.The reason that I gave a rating of ""average"" for cleanliness is because we noticed that the floor in our bedroom wasn't cleaned well. When we were making sure that we packed everything, my husband checked under the bed and there was an empty water bottle that wasn't ours. Also, I'm almost certain that there was a piece of cookie or some food on the floor near the table in our room, but I didn't want to touch it. I didn't complain about these small things because we didn't stay long and it wasn't enough to ruin our stay. Everything else in the room was very clean and up to par.","Naples, Italy","NavyWife11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Naples, Italy</strong>",52,4.0

The view is not fantastic but hey, this is Honolulu!Internet: Pretty bad. You do get wifi in your room, but if you need to update pictures and stuff, you need to go downstairs and use the wifi from the reception, which is a pain because you need to ask a code each time. The first day it did worked but not the second, the reception sent an IT guy in my room, and he confessed to me that there is only one modem for the whole building, explaining the slow internet. Parking; 20 dollars a day, no discount if you stay 2 weeks which is really disappointing.

We had originally booked a room at a very popular hotel across from Waikiki Beach, but we changed our minds after researching more about the Aqua Palms - and we are sure glad we did! It was so quiet yet we were close to everything. We could catch the bus or the trolley right out front, which was very convenient. We were able to walk to the beach, shopping centers, and restaurants. It was so nice to be close enough to the busier sections of the city and have the choice to return to peace and quiet. The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. We checked in late in the evening and requested a King bed and private lanai, which the front desk staff member graciously granted. Each time we checked out and returned beach towels, we were greeted with a smile. The concierge booked a tour for us we decided to take on short notice. She was very helpful and provided a wealth of information. The Thursday evening manager's reception was delightful. Their signature cocktail was quite tasty. The live music and light refreshments were fun to return to after a day of touring the island. We appreciated the refreshing ice cold lemon water in the lobby that was always available. The front desk gladly made change for us whenever we asked. When it was time to check out, a staff member booked us a shuttle to the airport and stored our bags for the day until our shuttle picked us up later that evening. We had a room on the eighth floor with a partial ocean view and a view of Diamond Head. It was fantastic! The room size was ample - far from being cramped. Although the bathroom was on the small side, there were plenty of toiletries and towels. The water pressure was awesome and we always had hot water. The bed was super comfortable, along with the pillows. I especially loved that there were five pillows! The room had a fridge and microwave, which came in handy allowing restaurant leftovers to be turned into a late night snack. We did not experience any inconveniences with the elevators. We did not utilize the parking garage, the pool, or workout facilities, but the pool looked great - nice and clean with plenty of lounge chairs. I really cannot complain about this property. I would stay here again and again and definitely recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Honolulu!!

Instead, the wifi is only available to guest in the lobby and ""complimentary"" means 10% off at the most expensive IHOP I have ever encountered. I understand the prices are increased because of tourism, however, the inclusion of breakfast was an important reason for choosing the Aqua Palms. Additionally, both of the rooms my friends and I were staying in (4 people per room) had one bed and one pull-out sofa. The pull-out sofa was incredibly uncomfortable and some of our party experienced back pain from their nights on the sofa mattresses. It is really unheard of for a hotel room meant to accommodate four people to not have two actual beds.That being said, the location is wonderful and the staff I interacted with were all incredibly friendly and helpful.

This is a great hotel with great service. The room I had was clean and orderly, the staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful and the location is a central mix between walking distance to downtown locations like the palace and to Waikiki beach or Honolulu Zoo. The only negative I really experienced was the lack of wifi in rooms. However, there was a LAN line available for Internet if I had a laptop available. The reason I list this as a negative is that I clearly was not the only one with the problem, as the hotel lobby was constantly filled with guests using the Internet. It affected the speed and privacy of messages and calls. All in all, great place to stay. ","Calgary, Canada","Brad C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",4,4.0

I highly recommend room 1109 because it has a wonderful view of neighboring buildings and way off in the background mountains with houses on them, all very picturesque. I felt appreciated by the staff when I checked in and glad that they followed up on my request for a high floor. The room was clean and the pillowtop bed extremely comfortable. My one tiny complaint is that I was rudely awakened at 1AM by a clock alarm, so it would have been great if when they readied the roomfor the new person they checked to make sure no alarm was set. I couldn't fall back to sleep forhours, but i got my bearings in the coming days. Shane on the tourism desk was really friendly and he booked my submarine trip which was an amazing experience. I found being on Oahu expensives some times and very reasonable other times. On my final day I spent a whopping$2.50 to go round trip to the North Shore (Turtle Bay Resort to be exact) on the city bus system which took over 2 hours each way. Another wonderful thing that happened at Aqua Palms was on Thursday they had live entertainment which consisted of a singer and a guitar player of Hawaiian music. I sort of at first wasn't sure about being in the center of all the action of Waikiki and thought maybe I should have gotten a hotel more off the beaten track, but it was exactly the right place for me, and very conveniently right around the block was a decent sized grocery store called Food Pantry. I ate the majority of my meals at the Wailana Coffee House which was no more than one half block from my hotel and the food was decent and just having some pineapple was a great welcome to the islands, Everyone in that coffee shop was friendly and it is a fact that the Hawaiian people are very warm and hospitable, and when you show the room key from the Aqua Palms they deduct 10% off what is already a reasonable bill. Another plus of the hotel was despite the numerous amount of guests the elevators were very prompt, and I recall there were at least 3 of them. I definitely will go back one day and stay at Aqua Palms, there were many things I did not get to do so it would be good to go back. One more tip don't spring for an expensive cab ride to the airport, right in front of the hotel on Ala Moana get the 19 or 20 bus to get to the airport in about an hour. ($2.50) just tuck your carry on under your seat and you will fit right in on the bus. Also if you go to Ala Moana Shopping Center and to their bus hub grab the 57 bus to go out to Kailua which is a suburb of Honolulu and a lovely trip over the green mountains. One of the worlds top 11 beaches is fairly close to the town center, it took my breath away. ($2.50 RT) I had a delicious meal out there and enjoyed every moment of avoiding Winter,Now i am back in NYC and it is snowing, oh well Spring must be right around the corner, I was first going to take the trolleys, but being an avid walker, I did a lot of that and really learned the city of Honolulu to some degree. I also highly recommend the Honolulu Museum of Art, it is housed in a beautiful building with gorgeous courtyards, and outdoor sculptures and Islamic and Indonesian Art plus a whole huge area of contemporary art, and also wonderful old Hawaiian paintings. I wanted to go to the home of Doris Duke who was one of their benefactors, which was only a short van ride away, and the museum had a great video on her estate, but they were sold out for that until after my trip. Maybe next time. One more thing on the hotel, unlike some places I did not hear a peep through the walls, it was very sound proof. There is also an excellent Thai restaurant right across the road from Wailana Coffee House. I'm so glad that I finally made it to Oahu. !!!

Somehow it seems rather unfair to compare an apple to an orange, so note that I am rating this hotel in comparison to what I would expect from a 21/2-3 star hotel. That being said, there were definitely some issues that you will want to consider while you are looking for a place to stay. These are the cons:1) Firstly, my room had a ""city"" view and the street noise was rather loud. One morning there was some sort of race going down Ala Moana Blvd starting at 5 am so there was a lot of loud cheering. There seems to be no noise insulation at all. Luckily, I was already awake because I was still on California time. I am personally not sensitive to noise, but in reading many hotel reviews over the years I recognize that some people are very sensitive and will want to consider this. 2) Also, my room did not have a balcony, more of a 1 foot ledge. Although I noticed the room next door to me did. If this is important to you, make sure you book a room with this option. 3) The pool is small and shallow (3-4ft), so if you like a nice pool, you may want to look elsewhere. However, why would you want a nice pool when there are beautiful beaches all around you? 4) The hotel restaurant is an IHOP. I am not a huge fan of IHOP food, so this was a con for me, but do note the location is great and there are plenty of other places to eat. 5) Finally, the rooms are somewhat outdated, but not horribly so.Now to the pros… I will honestly say there were definitely more pros than cons.1) Price -Although this hotel may not be cheap compared to other locations in the US, for Waikiki it is very affordable. I was here for work and since I work for a non-profit the budget was tight. This was the only hotel within this price range in Waikiki that did not have horrible reviews with multiple complaints. 2) The staff was very kind and helpful and everyone always had a smile and was willing to help in any way they could.3) The rooms were clean and well kept.4) The hotel has beach towels and beach chairs for guest use.5) There is parking available (con is that parking cost $20/night).6) The location is terrific. You can walk to Ala Moana and to the main strip in Waikiki. The Beach is close by as well. The location for this price is an outstanding value.7) There was a refrigerator, microwave and safe in the room.8) There is an affordable restaurant on site (but as stated above it is IHOP).9) Rooms are good size.You can see, the pros outweigh the cons. Most of the cons were not even cons for me personally. For a 21/2-3 star hotel this is a good buy in my opinion. If I had reason to stay in Honolulu in the future, I would definitely stay here. This is my third visit to HI, but my first time staying in Honolulu because I was here for work (for vacation we've stayed in Lanikai). But if you are looking for a place to stay where you can be part of the action in the heart of Waikiki I would recommend this place.","San Diego, California","Sumla0509</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",2,4.0

We were not expecting anything too fancy looking at the reviews and the price we paid. Our expectations were metThe hotel is a reasonable size facing onto the busy and noisy Ala Moana Boulevard and across from the Hilton Hawaiian Village.We had a Diamond Head View room on the front; it was noisy day and night with sirens and traffic in general even though we were on the 6 floor. We did ask to move to the back of the building but the rooms were smaller and the bathrooms tiny. We stuck with the original room 602 which was a decent size with a balcony. However the bathroom was small and the lighting was such that there were 2 over the sink and none over the shower so it seemed dark.The room had a coffee maker, microwave and fridge with an icemachine outside the door as well. There was free coffee in the lobby along with apples and lemon waterWifi was not expected in the room though they are hardwired and usable for free (most of us had tablets so not much help). The real pain with the wifi was that everytime you wanted to log in you had to get another code from reception, which sometimes meant a wait when you maybe only wanted to check your email or finalise a trip.The bed was comfortable and sheets/towels changed regularly. The toiletries were not too bad either if you came without.There is an IHOP attached to the hotel which was useful for an early substantial breakfast. We were 2 mins walk from a Hiking Cafe which did really excellent coffee, paninis and such stuff, so most days we went there.The main advantage of the hotel was the proximity to things, we had a bus stop outside the hotel which was useful for the bigger trips to Pearl Harbour and the like. We were 10 mins walk to Ala Moana shopping centre and close enough to walk along the beach or roads into WaikikiWe had a car for a week and parked at the Harbour beside the Hilton, during the week they have a 24 hour special for $12 and at other times there is either free parking or special offers worth considering. It was well lit and worth the 5 min walk not to have to pay for the higher charges in the hotel.We used the laundry facilities but beware the hotel sells powder etc for a reasonable $125 per pack but we found it in the ABC stores that you trip over on every street corner for less and you don't have to make change to buy that (although reception was more than happy to assist in supplying the change).On the whole for the price we paid my only gripe was the road noise that we could not do anything about, otherwise reasonable value for money if you are staying a while but if you want something for a short trip or something special look elsewhere","Calgary, Canada","jacquirs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",35,3.0

This was a let down. You can do great things with old buildings, but that's not the case here. This ""boutique"" hotel affixes a cheap once-flashy and unconvincing, tired veneer to a run down building that shows its age. The public spaces and rooms show too many halfway attempts at minimal, low-budget modernization. Today the wallpaper, carpet and draperies are well-worn, stained and depressing. Furnishings are utterly basic and show their age.The lobby level staff was average; upstairs we fared better some days then others with the thoroughness of the cleaning staff. You get what you pay for.Wireless exists only in the lobby, and the building restaurant is an IHOP. Those should be clarion clues to where this hotel rests in the hierarchy. We encountered a hooker in the hall on the first night, and a shady thuggish teenaged duo lurking around one of the parking levels on the second. Were I a parent, I wouldn't let my kids venture to the vending machine or pool unescorted.With high expectations and keen competition driving the market up and down Waikiki, Aqua Palms isn't a contender. Yes, you'll want to spend all the time you can outside your room and hotel when you're in Oahu, and many options are overpriced. But by defnition you've spent a lot of money to travel this far to enjoy all that Honolulu and the environs have to offer. You can surely find a better loding alternative in your budget that will bring a more positive experience.","Madison, Wisconsin","PrairiePaddler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Madison, Wisconsin</strong>",131,2.0

We were greeted with the aloha spirit even though it was close to 10pm when we were checking in. Our room was a standard room - we didn't need much space and the housekeeping staff was great! They even left a handwritten note one morning which I appreciated upon my return to my room. Previous reviews about the dated decor remain true however I was more concerned about cleanliness than whether we had state of the art technologies etc. The bathroom was clean and I was really happy to see the shower curtain wasn't dirty or moldy! What I was also thankful for was the gated parking structure - this enabled me to feel secure knowing that my car and belongings were safe (or safer than if we had parked in an open structure). I also enjoyed the proximity to everything - there was a block party on Kalakaua that we were able to walk to - very convenient. Also, I loved that it was so close to Wailana's! A couple downsides (that didn't hinder our stay but just for a head's up for future visitors) were the slight confusion regarding accessing the parking structure prior to check-in. Since it is gated, you need a hotel key to access the structure and there was only a small driveway in front of the hotel that you can park while you check-in. I imagine if you're checking in during the day, the traffic would be troublesome however, since we were checking in late, this wasn't a problem. Also, if a the view is a priority for you, be sure to double check with the front desk that your room has one. The rooms on either side of ours had full balconies with lounge chairs but ours had 2 very narrow (could only fit one person) balconies which was separated by a huge wall in the middle of the doors. Again, as this wasn't of importance to us, we weren't bothered by it. I do want to point out the excellent service of the management staff. A couple days after I arrived home, I received a survey requesting my feedback. I made a comment about the complimentary lotion provided by the hotel in the bathroom and how it was so fragrant and continued to remind me of Hawaii now that I was back home. I had hoped it was available for purchase so I put a call into the general manager, Patty Maher, to inquire if this was an option however Patty had read my feedback and offered to send me a couple at no cost - that it was her pleasure to do so! This kind of service is exactly what comes to mind when I think of ""Aloha Spirit"" and Patty went way above and beyond my expectations!

The bathrooms have been more than adequately renovated at some stage, AIRCON is ducted & works well albeit quite noisily & by European standards the rooms are a good size. Other reviewers have more than covered the very convenient locational aspects & I would concur with others in that if traffic noise is an issue for you -ask for a room on the city side. The Hotel is located on the Western or city side of Ala Moana Blvd - so the East facing Diamond Head view rooms face the street.

Prior to my stay I had asked the staff if they could possibly have champagne in my room for me and my significant other. When I arrived in my room I was so surprised to see a bottle of champagne two wine glasses, card and a box of chocolates. Although my GF probably almost freaked thinking I was going to propose or something :). Room was clean and our room was cleaned everyday right after we left for our outings. As stated in other reviews shower lighting is a bit dark, but I wasn't in Hawaii to spend my time in the shower. We were facing the street side it's busy and was a tad bit noisy but didn't bother us we slept with sliding glass door open ever night. Didn't bring our I pad so don't know about Internet. Pool was very clean and they had a BBQ grill at pool. That while looking out my balcony one day I saw the Aqua Palms staff light the grill up so the guest could Q up some steaks which you know us guys that like to Q that looked like a vacation it's self. The only thing that the Pool was missing was a Spa which would have been cool to relax in maybe a evening or two, and it wasn't fair looking across the way seeing guest at the Hilton village chill in the Hot tub lol. The gym was a bit small equipment could be updated but hey I'm a guy who like to lift weights so of course in going to complain about that. Great location you have tones of restaurants to choose from within walking distance. We didn't feel once we got there we didn't need to rent a car after all and right across the street you can rent cars, jeeps , scooters which is right next to KOBE steakhouse. You have I hop right next door to Hotel after that a Decent coffee and breakfast house around the corner from that a ABC store. On the other side of the hotel u have a chinese buffet and down the street from that u have some more restaurant. The trolley stops right in front of hotel the pink line you can ride for two bucks, which will take you to all the shopping u lady's can imagine. The beach is about a 7 to 10minute walk depending if u catch the crosswalk light at the right time. The city bus also stops at the hotel if you want to travel further or you can pretty much catch any Trolley in front of Hotel.

Location - The Aqua Palms is conveniently located for my business trip. The IHOP is next door and was perfect for having breakfast in the morning. I tried the diner (forgot the name) right around the corner on the first night and didn’t find the food all that good so stuck with IHOP for the rest of my stay. The hotel is not a beach front property but is only a 5-minute walk at best. There are ABC stores (convenience store) on almost every block and there’s one right around the corner of the hotel. The popular outdoor shopping strip Ala Moana is nearby and is about 10 minutes walk. Hotel and Amenities - I found the hotel lobby to smell a bit funny, a bit musty which I found surprising as I didn’t think the weather in Hawaii was humid which could’ve contributed to the smell. Thank goodness the hotel room didn’t smell that way. Internet is free and wifi is only available in the lobby. In the room, you must use the ethernet cord which I found inconvenient as I didn’t travel with a laptop (brought my tablet instead). To use the wifi in the lobby, you must obtain a username and password from the receptionist. It would be in the best interest of the hotel to offer wifi in the rooms as more and more people are traveling with tablets nowadays. I checked out the fitness room and I could remember seeing a treadmill and another machine. The pool isn’t as nice as you see it on their website; it is much smaller than it appears to be.Room - I was given a room with a king bed. The room is a bit small, the king bed took up most of the room. The furniture is old. At first I thought that it was just the furniture style but my colleague who also stayed at the hotel told me that it is old and that the varnish had worn off. My room had a balcony but not one where you can step out into. I didn’t care for a balcony that I can step out into but was happy that I was able to open the sliding door to get fresh air in the room. There’s a mini fridge and microwave in the room which I didn’t use but I know would be nice and convenient for some guests looking to stay at the hotel. The bathroom is small and it could use more lighting. The bathtub is two-third the size of a traditional bathtub (I thought it was cute). The toiletries were nice and I ended up not using the ones I brought with me. They’re nicely scented; coconut lime, coconut some other, etc. Staff - I had minimal interaction with the staff during my week’s long stay. Of the interactions that I had, I found them to be nice and courteous. When I checked in, I was assigned a room on a lower floor. I asked for a higher floor and they accommodated. The housekeeper I ran into on morning was cheery and greeted me. The bellman offered help when I was leaving the hotel.Parking - I rented a car towards the end of my stay which I parked at the hotel garage for $20. The space is tight and you’d be fine with a sedan but a mini van or a SUV would be really tough.The popular hotel comparison websites rated Aqua Palms a 2-star hotel. I’d give this place 2.5 stars. Overall, I had a good stay. The hotel is a good alternative to the pricey major brands. The room was comfortable. This hotel is suitable for business travelers and couples but I can’t really say it would be for families though. I didn’t get a room with 2 beds so I don’t know how comfortable it’d be (I found my room to be small with a king bed so a room with 2 beds of a similar room size?).",Washington D.C.,"heysnoopy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington D.C.</strong>",25,3.0

As we were planning to move onto the other islands after the weekend we didn't need a resort type hotel for this visit. We booked a city view room (see photo for the view) from the UK via lastminute.com and the checkin went without problem. We were allocated room 1125, just below penthouse level. Initially we were a little disappointed with the room's basic look and feel but it was late at night and we weren't in the best frame of mind as the flight from mainland USA had been a bit rough. By the morning the room although a bit dated in terms of decor looked and felt a lot better and probably in keeping with the pricing and rating.The bathroom was pretty small with a reasonably powerful shower above the bath tub. Think the room had a small fridge (how soon you forget when in various hotels or is it age!), plus coffee maker (one sachet provided) but no kettle for tea etc. Decent sized and comfortable bed plus a small settee. Small balcony with chair. The only downside to the balconies is that one or two people had some sort of cooking facilities (eg similar to electric woks) on theirs and so the smells tended to waft into our room on occasions. Can't really blame the hotel for that though.Room cleaning was a bit haphazard. The first day was maybe partly our fault as we were in and out of the room on a few occasions and maybe missed our 'slot'. But on the second day we were out from 6.30am until 3.30pm and it hadn't been cleaned by then. Got a knock at the door just after that to clean the room but by then we'd just got in we're showering etc so it wasn't cleaned then, so in effect it wasn't cleaned / serviced at all during our stay.Free coffee was available from the reception area, just help yourself. Various other varieties were available at a small cost. The concierge (Shane I think) was very helpful and the tour we booked via him to Pearl Harbour was very good value.Five minute walk to Waikiki beach and generally the hotel was in a nice area with a diner iHop and other cafes / restaurants next to it. Plus ABC stores within a couple of minutes. Despite the cleaning issues we would stay again as it was a good base for the area.","Northallerton, United Kingdom","Gary_n_Kris</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northallerton, United Kingdom</strong>",14,4.0

When I stay in a Hawaii hotel, I don't care about the view (I view the ocean and mountains from my home), I care about the hotel's location, cleanliness, comfort, the ease of getting from my car to my room and the attitude of the staff. The Aqua Palms does well in almost all of these categories for me as a business traveler and as a comparative value, I would say that it is worth considering as a vacation hotel, too. Understand first that the location of the hotel on Ala Moana Blvd, is pretty good. The hotel is not in the heart of Waikiki but it is located two blocks from the union of the two primary roads in Waikiki. It is near restaurants, Ala Moana Shopping Center (once the largest outdoor mall in the US), and easily accessible to the beach (a brief look at pedestrian traffic outside the hotel shows locals carrying their surfboards to the beach ... its got to be nearby, right? And it is.) The hotel is clean. First tipoff about any good hotel: how clean is it? The Aqua is clean! My room was also comfortable, not large but big enough, with a usable and (again) very clean bathroom. The absence of a light in the dark shower was not to my liking but of little importance overall. The hotel's only negative is the parking. Parking a car larger than an economy car would be problematic for me and the hotel needs to figure out an alternative to making a guest return to the car after check-in so that the guest can put a parking pass on the dashboard. It was bad enough for me traveling alone ... I can't imagine what a father with two tired kids and an exhausted wife would feel like. And finally, if you want to know something about ALOHA, wait until you meet the housekeeping staff. They smile, they laugh, they truly seem to want you to be happy. Just thinking about the smile on the face of the woman that cleaned my room one day makes me laugh even now! The same is true for the front desk team and even the Expedia Activities concierge in the lobby! Oh! and some reviewers say they had to pay for the internet but I didn't. I don't know why but the in-room internet in my room was free. So despite the non-view, the absence of rolling surf outside my window, it all works. For business? Absolutely. For tourists? It's good value and well worth strong consideration.","Princeville, Hawaii","Thomas B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Princeville, Hawaii</strong>",14,4.0

Great to have a bar frig and microwave in the room, but with no crockery or cutlery, the latter seemed a little pointless. Even some plastic throwaways would suffice for eating breakfast cereal. Big TV which we never turned on, as too busy being out and about, on tours and walking. Happy with all staff, especially Tour Desk staff who were extremely helpful and friendly, so our Honolulu tours were booked through them. Very handy to have a trolley stop outside the hotel to get to shops and Waikiki. One of Honolulu's 72 ABC shops close by; cafes a short walk; restaurants and shops in Hilton complex across the road and not far to beach, park, etc. We would recommend this reasonably priced, comfortable hotel and would stay again if returning to Hawaii in the future.",Caloundra Australia,"Roz K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Caloundra Australia</strong>",0,5.0

Waikiki is located in Honolulu mainly along Waikiki beach in a heavily populated area that saw a lot of construction in the 70s and therefore there are a plethora of hotels of this vintage. From the water looking at the city it seems it basically stretches from left (where the ala wai cannal) comes in to the right ( towards Diamondhead crater almost)So choosing a hotel is this: do you want or need to be close to anything in particular or simply can walk everywhere because you really can in Waikiki. The beaches are all in close distance regardless of where you stay so don't pay extra for a beachfront if you don't have to....though some are nice on the water too. One really good option is the Aqua Palms hotel and Spa. This is a regularly maintained hotel of boutique stature that was super convenient to use and cost effective. Close to their biggest mall with a short 15 minute walk ( no seriously it's a mall but a lovely one if you want anything at all ) otherwise go to their ABC stores which are pretty  famous there and have almost everything......they are on every block. No really....they are.Walking to the beaches is just a step across the street behind the Hilton which is a great spot to pick up any and all tour buses and city tours.Walking to high end shopping is just through a park and there you are.Pretty well located it is. Our room was nice and comfortable enough while not large by any standards our room with balcony facing Diamondhead was great. Some might find the street noise bothersome if the door to the balcony is open so in that case ask for a room facing the back......we did not mind that as it was quiet when the door was closed. Good to have a fridge and microwave in the room too as there WILL be times you want to just eat something at the room. Or put a bottle of something in there from the ABC stores where booze and food is relatively cheap...good tip.Our concierge which we nick named "" Connie Serge"" ...Janelle actually was an Expedia expert so she was super helpful in booking lots of things for us to do. In fact it was easy to blow another $1300 on activities as there are lots to do.Overall the hotel was great. The pool was being retiled when we were there but who cares when there are beaches. It is done now and looks pleasant.This is not a super fancy hotel but still very nice.The only downside was the ihop restaurant attached to it had abysmal service. Take twenty steps past it to the coffee shop on the corner and be treated to retro 70s glam in an old school type diner with good food and service. It was popular and reasonable.We would stay at the Aqua Palms again. Have fun!",,Darrenmonette,47,4.0

As the hotel was so cheap (approx. £60 per night) and was rated 3 star, I wasn't expecting anything special. On arrival, without our asking, we were upgraded to a Diamond Head view room at no additional cost. Room was spacious, well appointed, clean and a great little balcony with a view of the pool, diamond head and the sea. Room was still fairly quiet considering it was street facing. Great location, with Ala Moana shopping centre and Waikiki beach both within 10 minutes walking distance.

I would recommend to anyone looking for a decent hotel at a reasonable price (I researched other places and this seems to best value for $).I'll start with the positivesGreat location - very close to Ala Moana mall (10 minute walk) and the main center of Waikiki (10 min walk). Also Hilton complex is just across the road (many places to eat and hang out, huge fireworks show over the beach on Fridays) which offers easy access to nice part of Waikiki beach (plus hotel offers beach towels and chairs). Rooms are spacious, clean and pretty much match what you see in the pictures. Bathroom was a bit 'cozy' as the door almost hits the toilet but we managed. Bed was very comfortable. AC worked just fine and TV offered wide selection of channels. microwave and small fridge made eating in easy as well. Lanai (patio) is small but i spent almost every morning out there with coffee and the paper.No wifi in the room but they do have a data cable (old school). i've heard they are looking at updating so Wifi will be available in the room. We connected using the cable and it was slow - you won't be able to stream video or Skype. So basic internet browsing is about it. My father had his iPad and used the WiFi in the lobby - always very slow as well.Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. I won't get into all the examples but i'll say we never had a problem and in several instances they exceeded my expectations. The pool was being renovated while we were there but, hey, who goes to the pool when you have such a great beach across the road? Ok, I can see that some like to use the pool but it's good to see that the hotel is renovating stuff (they also were painting hallways) - they have to do this stuff sometime.other things of note - room key gets you 10% off at Macy's and IHOP. free newspaper. manager reception on thursday evenings with some food, drink, and music. great little Italian restaurant around corner on Ena Rd (Davino). Food pantry for groceries about 5 minute walk. No real huge negatives but you will need to be aware that any rooms that face the ocean also face the main road so are noisy. This is simply a function of the hotel being located on a main (busy) road and the amount of activity in the waikiki area (sirens fairly frequent and, i guess, trucks are allowed to use engine breaks in town...odd). This is probably one of the loudest locations I've ever stayed. Don't let this deter you, if you are a very light sleeper, bring ear plugs just in case. The hotel has done a decent job of insulating against the street noise. Or, ask for room at the back of the hotel, much quieter.","Nelson, New Zealand","Trav11er</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nelson, New Zealand</strong>",70,4.0

The hotel is clean, comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Proximity to the beach is great considering it is not a beach front hotel. Took me 8 minutes from the time I got on the elevator in the hotel till I set my beach chair and towel (provided free from hotel) on the beach.........would have been a bit longer if the only traffic light wasn't green. This end of Waikiki Beach also seemed less busy as opposed to the other end with all the high end shopping, which I found more relaxing. Waikiki is a bit of a concrete jungle except for the beach, so it is what it is. It's very close to all kinds of places to eat and drink. From the crazy expensive to the cheap and cheerful, all within walking distance. The trolley stop is right out front of the hotel if you don't feel like walking at all though. If you want to surf the net in your room you'll need to bring a laptop or something that hard wires into the internet. WiFi is free but only available in the lobby. The pool was being renovated when we were there, but I didn't travel all the way to Hawaii to sit by a pool anyway. Saw them painting our hallway baseboards which to me didn't look like they needed it, so I think the overall hotel condition is good. Room to room noise is better than average for a hotel, but the street noise takes a night or two to get use to and the traffic is quietest between 11pm and 7am. I think a better seal on the balcony sliding door would help that just a touch too. They also have kitchenette suites which from a couple we met there said they were happy with as well. I would consider that option next time because I would have not problem staying at the Aqua Palms again.","Thunder Bay, Canada","TBay-ON</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Thunder Bay, Canada</strong>",9,4.0

I find myself in Hawaii every couple of years and usually my trips are planned in advance so that I am in a Hilton property where I have Diamond status. This trip came up at the last minute and there were no Hilton properties available at the Government rate which I qualify for. With all of that being said I was booked into the Aqua Palms which is not affiliated with any points system that I am a member of. None of this is the Aqua Palms fault. The staff was pleasant and professional. Check in and out was breeze. Parking was $20 per day and convenient; the spaces are tight so you are better off with a small car, but full size will fit.The room I was given (1010) was spacious and had a good view of the Hilton Hawaiian Village property and probably had one of the better ocean views available here, but its still a partial view. The furnishings had seen better days, but were not bad. The bed & pillows were very comfortable. The LCD TV was fine and the free internet access was adequate. The AC worked very well also which is important to me.The rate I was given was actually lower than the Gov't rate and reflects that this property is geared more for the discount Hawaii tourist. The location is very good for Trolley and bus service and it is s short walk or ride to the huge Ala Moana Shopping Mall. I am a spoiled business traveler, but after I got over the fact that I was not getting my usual perks I found that I really enjoyed being here.

I have stayed at this hotel twice, and the service is consistently impeccable. If you have just flown into Honolulu and need a hotel for any length of time, it is well worth your time to consider the Aqua Palms. It is very centrally located in Waikiki and is within a very short walk to the beach, search for the location on Google maps and you will be surprised and pleased to see how close to the beach it really is! We always arrive in Honolulu late at night, and reception at these hours is very important to us especially after a long flight. The staff manning the reception have always been very friendly no matter how late we arrive, and are always going out of their way to help us. If you need anything they will do their best to assist you with a smile. The rooms are all very clean, and have a great view, some face towards the mountains whilst others face the city, but Waikiki is very pretty so it doesn't really matter which one you chose, because you should be in Hawaii to have fun and be outdoors, and not for the view from your room! The beds are very comfortable, the bathrooms spotless and all with their own brand of toiletries that are very nice indeed. All the rooms have their own AC and decent TV if you find yourself tired out from a day at the beach. The laundry room access is great if you would prefer to save some money and do your own. Another point worth mentioning is that on the same floor as reception, there is an IHOP (International House of Pancakes), which opens at the crack of dawn and serves delicious food. The Ala Moana mall is within easy walking distance and is sure to delight anyone who is in the mood for some retail therapy. The hotel also provides free beach towels and chairs, so no need to bring those, bath towels too, which can save you space when packing your luggage. You get free Royal Kona Coffee in your room each day, to brew in a two person size coffee machine, which is a treat.

As soon as we arrived, tired and not a little crabby after flying 7500 miles, our hearts lifted and stayed pretty much aloft for the whole week we were there!The whole experience at Aqua Palms was brilliant. It was spotless and kept that way by an attentive staff, each of whom we encountered was courteous and helpful to a fault. Our room was on the 8th floor with a city view and we were only disappointed in that we didn't have a 'proper' balcony on which to sit. Our bed was out of this world and the bedding wonderful and changed regularly during our stay and a nice array of shampoos, conditioner, body lotion etc. was replaced daily.Downside? Observations rather than complaints: the three lifts were hard pressed to cope at peak times, the lobby and public seating area is so much smaller than the webside leads you to believe and a bar would have been a welcome feature. Nitpicking? The toilet roll quality was poor - I would take my own next time and the archaic in-room ethernet internet links came as a great shock! Even in relative backwaters like Greece and Turkey we have enjoyed wi-fi but here it was only availble in the lobby. A bit of a pain.Overall? Take me back tomorrow.

You could view the fireworks at the Hilton on Friday nights and walk to the mall. The location is excellent! The best thing was the Wailana Coffee House next to the hotel. Don't even think of going to IHOP! Wailana is open 24 hours! They have pancakes to die for, all you can eat with flavors like Macadamia Nut and Banana with coconut syrup. Yummy! I know it's weird to mention a restaurant in a hotel review but Hawaii is expensive so this $8 special is a good deal. They also have Karaoke :). I would definitely stay at the Aqua Palms again. The happy hour was okay (pineapple juice and nice music). The only downside about the hotel (why it gets 4*'s instead 5) is because they barely cleaned it during the seven days we stayed there. They change the sheets and towels and empty the trashcans but that's about it. On our last night, one of the rubber cleaning gloves was even left in the bathroom near my makeup. I pray it wasn't used to clean the toilet. Also, it's about $25 a day to park.

Generally they're all of a good standard and I now settle for hotels that are reasonably priced in a good location as some of the higher priced ones are still quiet tired inside. I'd stayed at the Aqua Wave a number of times and whilst the location is superb, the noise isn't and after signing up to the Aqua Hotels mailing list, took advantage of an offer from the Palms for a partial ocean view. The rooms are fine, cleaning spot on, lifts are fast and the noise is not a problem. I bought my Apple WiFi router to set up wireless in the room as it's still cable internet and the pool is fine to lay by for a few hours but it's not exactly a place of tranquility.

We spent a very enjoyable 5 nights at the Aqua Palms in May 2012. Everything I had read on the Trip Advisor website regarding this property lived up to our expectations. The staff were welcoming and very friendly and helpful, as is everyone else in Honolulu. The rooms were comfortable and our room located on the 10th floor was very quiet. We had a Diamond Head room, with nice views of Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach.The only negative was that this room did not have a lanai you could go outside and sit on, to watch the view. (The Aqua Plams website stated that the room did have a Lanai)I booked this room way in advance on the Aqua Palms website and got a good discount. Cost was about $115.00 per night. Breakfast was included with the Diamond Head Room, at the on site I Hop restaurant. The I hop was a bit disapointing in that the service was very slow and the meals not all that fantastic, although the pancakes with blueberry sauce was okay. I am surprised that the I Hop in general draws such negative comments, in that it is located in a prime position and the floor space is huge. I can imagine later on it turning into a Starbucks or MacdonaldsThe Aqua Palms has a fantastic location opposite the Hawaiilan Village Complex. You can walk through the beautiful grounds of this Hotel down to Waikiki beach. There is a nice Starbucks on the way with beautiful native gardens. There are numerous eating and shopping options close by. Check the Cheeseburger joint out where the waitpersons wear grass skirts and the Japanese sushi buffet at about $30 a head a few minutes walk away. Also there is a 24 hour restaurant/diner even closer which serves a wide variety of gigantic meals and has very friendly staff. Try the enormous ""special ice cream with banana fritters"", which is almost a meal in itself. There are numerous ABC stores in close proximity which are like Australian 7/11s but about 100 times better. You can buy decent Aloha shirts and T Shirts there without having to go to the more upmarket stores. For shopaholics you are in for a treat, the Ala Moana Shopping Centre is a short $2.50 bus ride away on ""The Bus"" (Stop right out side the Hawaiian village.) This is the best shopping centre/mall I have been in my life and the recently opened Westfield at Stratford in London near the Olympic Stadium pales in comparison. I couldn't keep my wife away from the place !! There are some great places for buying T Shirts with fantastic surfing logos - Hawaiian Island Creations located on the ground floor and Macy's have a huge selecton of Aloha Ware. There are numerous restaurants to get a reasonably priced meal.Another place not to miss is the beautiful Ala Moana Park a short walk right opposite the Shopping Centre.

Both times we stayed in a Diamondhead View room with a balcony. The rooms were clean, spacious, and comfortable. They had a safe, closet, ironing board/iron, fridge and microwave (making it convenient to bring leftovers back from dinner). The first time my mom and I stayed for one night before our cruise and two nights after. At that time they had complimentary Hawaiian sweet rolls and fruit for breakfast.This time my husband and I stayed for almost a week after our cruise. We booked a package through the website that included a rental car, parking, and free breakfast each day. It was a phenomenal deal!The location is terrific--it is directly across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village. A five minute walk behind the Hilton and you are on the beach (all of the beach is public) or can go to the Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon. Fort DeRussy Park is a few minutes away by walking. We walked further, but easily, to Waikiki Beach and along the shops of Luxury Row. Ala Moana Blvd. is very busy, but it was not noisy on our balcony or inside our room. The crowds at Waikiki Beach are not for us, so we are glad that we were not right in the heart of Waikiki Beach. We had everything available to us from our location and it was much more peaceful.The pool is a little small and we only used it on our last day, but when you are in Hawaii just 5 minutes from beautiful beaches this was not an issue.We had a very late flight so we requested the possibility of having a late check-out. We had to come back to speak with the manager about this. When we did, the manager seemed to have been dealing with a demanding guest (it was New Year's weekend and the person wanted additional rooms for additional days, and was upset that the manager did not have any available). At first the manager seemed unsure if he could accommodate us. When my husband elaborated about our stay and how I was a return guest, the manager was more at ease that we were happy and satisfied guests. Although he could not let us stay as long as we had hoped, he did extend our time by a few hours for which we were grateful. Before booking this trip, I reviewed other hotels and well as this one since it had been 4 years since the last time I had stayed at Aqua Palms. There were mixed reviews about the hotel, but none that swayed me to go elsewhere. I don't know why people are so negative about the hotel--it is very nice and in a great location and well-maintained. Sure, it is not a ""luxury"" hotel, but the furnishings are tasteful, fresh, and clean. The Aqua Palms is very comfortable and way more than adequate for someplace to sleep and recharge for the next day. The value is excellent, and I guarantee that our vacation experience would not have been any better had we stayed across the street for twice as much money. I would return in a heartbeat to Aqua Palms. (Also the manager told us that they have special rates for returning guests, but you have to contact the hotel directly for confirmation.)","Dayton, Ohio","InternetBarbie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dayton, Ohio</strong>",32,5.0

Just a short walk to many points of interest. Just one block away were three car rental offices. We rented from Enterprise and did the Island Circle tour which was very easy and educational. About 1/2 block was Wailana Coffee House where we enjoyed breakfast each morning. They give a discount when you show your Aqua Palms room key. Aqua Palms had a laundry facility for guests which was very useful after a week at a convention, The washers and dryers were $1.25 each (quarters only). The laundry was located on P3 (Parking Garage level 3). Wish they had a chair to sit in while doing laundry. We were on the 6th floor overlooking Ala Moana Blvd and did not notice the traffic noise mentioned in other reviews.We visited Pearl Harbor Saturday before embarking on the cruise. The Aqua Palms allowed us to extend check-out to 1:00. This was very helpful. We used VIP Transportation round-trip from the hotel to Pearl Harbor $9 per person.

It is our 3rd time staying here in 5 years. We always go at the same time at the beginning of May to celebrate our anniversary. This time it was our 30th and even though I had asked my husband if he wanted to try a different hotel for a change he said loved the location, being able to walk through the Hilton, easy access to highways and the beach being only a short walk away. We stayed on the 9th floor with a great view of Diamond Head and a partial view of the ocean. I really enjoyed being able to lay in my bed at night and see the city lights with DIamond head in the distance. The staff were very friendly, always smiling and very accommodating. Generally we would spend our days on the North Shore snorkelling but at night it was nice to unwind at a location that wasn't as busy as the main strip is. Friday nights there are fireworks at the Hilton, Thursday there are free cocktails, chips and dip and lovely live music to enjoy. Beach towels, free apples, coffee/tea, lemon water and newspaper are also available in the lobby or at the front desk. Its a safe area and within walking distance of Ala Moana Mall where there are additonal restuarants. Reasonable rates, clean hotel, safe area, close to the beach, restaurants and shopping.

They had an afternoon with free cocktails and music in the lobby, and the staff were always very lovely and helpful.The road was a bit loud, however we had no trouble sleeping.We also used the car park which was $20 a day but I didn't find it that bad and it was secure.Overall I'd definitely recommend this hotel - it was so cheap and we loved it.

While the rooms have not been upgraded (except for the new, flat, wall-mounted TV), the rooms are clean and comfortable. We originally booked a room with a king-size bed and Diamond Head view; however, upon reaching our 5th floor room, we soon discovered that we would not be able to sleep during our 5-night stay. The Diamond Head view rooms are on the front of the hotel, and road noise is very loud. Additionally, nighttime road work was being done on Ala Moana Boulevard. We made a quick call to the front desk asking for a higher room or a room on the back, and we were quickly brought a key to another 5th floor room on the back side of the hotel with a city view. I didn't consider the fact that we were trading for a cheaper room, so I never asked for any partial refund or financial consideration -- wish I had at least asked for free breakfast which did not come with our original booking. We were just glad to get a room that would allow us five quiet nights of sleep, and the room had a decent view. The room change also resulted in a smaller bed (queen-size). We were very happy with the balcony that we enjoyed every evening. The front desk staff was always friendly and accommodating. They answered all of our questions, even making sure that we would find the local Walmart. The helpful man at the valet parking desk made sure to let me know where we could park if the hotel area of the garage was full when we returned from the Polynesian Cultural Center. By the way, driving and parking in the garage is as tight as other reviewers have stated -- just be careful. We had hoped to use the PC in the lobby, but the machine can only be used with a credit card, and the price quoted for each quarter hour was more than we wanted to pay. The refrigerator and microwave in the room were handy since it allowed us to enjoy coffee and light breakfast on the balcony before heading out each day and a snack after returning each evening. This was a help for reserving our eating budget for a good meal out during the day. The location of Aqua Palms was perfect for our needs. It is good for using the bus service. One day, we rode to Pearl Harbor to spend the morning at the USS Arizona Memorial and then worked our way back to the hotel. Another day, we took a bus to the Bishop Museum. The location of the hotel is also good for walking to Waikiki Beach where we enjoyed evening strolls on the beach. We were very satisfied with our stay at Aqua Palms. It provided clean, comfortable lodging convenient to the attractions of our choice without spending dollars for oceanfront views. (We reserved those dollars for a different island on the trip).","Nashville, Tennessee","RetiredTravelerTN</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>",1083,4.0

Consequently, we are always looking for a budget-friendly hotel that provides us with a good experience and allows us to enjoy the island. That's what we've found at the Aqua Palms, which is why this was our second stay at this hotel in two years.While I don't know how we managed this, we were upgraded to a 12th floor two-room suite on our recent trip and loved every minute of it. Our suite came with a kitchen, full-size refrigerator, and a huge lanai that I loved to sit on to watch the sun rise and Waikiki come to life. The room was quite clean and very comfortable and made this a place that I wanted to relax in almost as much as I wanted to head to the beach.That said, most travellers are not going to be upgraded to a suite. So, how's the rest of the hotel? While much smaller than our two-room suite, our room two years ago was also comfortable and provided us with a great base to explore Oahu. When we decided to head back to the islands, we knew based on that experience that the Aqua Palms was where we needed to stay on Oahu. The common areas of the hotel, while not overwhelmingly spacious, are acceptable and the staff is quite gracious. I love that they provide towels for the beach and they also have a nice, but busy, laundry facility in the parking ramp. Part of what attracts us to this hotel is it's location. You're across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village and Fort DeRussy, which means that you have great views of most of the Waikiki skyline and Diamond Head. On each of our visits, we've booked a Partial Ocean-View room to take advantage of this view. In addition, this means that you're about a 10 minute walk through or around the Hilton complex to the beach and can get out of Waikiki - and head to Ala Moana, for example - in a very short time. If you're looking for a comfortable, affordable hotel in a great Waikiki location, then look no farther than the Aqua Palms. It provides enough bells-and-whistles to help make the vacation memorable, but without breaking the bank. We've enjoyed it both times we've visited Oahu and plan on staying there again when we return to the islands.","Saint Louis, Missouri","CoMoRob</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",16,4.0

However, I suspect most parking garages in Waikiki are like this. The other item is that if you are arriving in a rental; there's not really a good place to park in front of the hotel to check in. You will need to pull into the hotel garage and dial the front desk so they can 'buzz' you in to park. Otherwise; this is a clean, comfortable hotel with a very friendly and helpful staff. I will say that the hotel is a little older and it might show here and there, but should not take away from an enjoyable stay. It is about a ten minute walk to Waikiki Beach and just a five minute drive to Ala Moana mall. I stayed in a room with a partial ocean view and it was well worth the (reasonable) cost. I had views of the mountains, Diamond Head and the ocean from my balcony, but I would suggest you try to get a room above the 9th floor. Traffic is a bit noisy on the street. Okay; its very noisy, but if you shut the balcony door its not distracting. I happen to like traffic noise, but I think you'll find your room to be quiet and safe at night. The staff makes every effort to ensure you are comfortable and provides everything you might need. I was treated like a special guest and felt very welcome.

At check in Larry was able to give us a king bedroom on a high floor, but we didn't get a balcony though. Our room ended up facing a hotel next door and its parking lot. We didn't spend much time in the room so it worked out just fine. Aqua Palms also has a laundry area and a pool. I think they also had beach towels but we didn't use that service. The staff was nice and accomodating (we had to call a houseman four times as we couldn't figure out how to set up a safe code).

It is really on the edge of Waikiki, which, depending upon your preferences, should be a prime consideration in choosing the hotel. You are removed from the Waikiki madness and much of the noise, but your dining options are limited unless you want to walk in to Waikiki or Ala Moana. There is no room service, but there is a coffee house on the block that is open late (Wailana Coffee House), and of couse, the ubiquitous ABC stores for essentials. An Outback and Red Lobster are also very close, and the hotel as an IHOP connected to its lobby. The last three being chain restaurants, I would encourage visitors to explore a little further. There are much more unique and interesting dining options in Waikiki.As you are on the edge of Waikiki, Ala Moana shopping center and park are also within walking distance.The hotel has a very small pool.

We were on the 10th floor and I didn't find the road construction noise to be terrible, but it was significantly more noise than the room at HHV that also faced Ala Moana.The complimentary breakfast at IHOP was mediocre - you can pick from 3 pre-arranged meals (oatmeal, french toast, or eggs/meat/pancakes). IHOP was busy that morning and our food came spread out over 20+ minutes - I had finished my oatmeal before the others in our family got their eggs & bacon, and their pancakes arrived 10 minutes after that.We didn't use the pool, preferring to walk over to HHV to use the lagoon and beach instead.","Superior, Colorado","ColoradoPeltier</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Superior, Colorado</strong>",33,3.0

One thing we would point out though, returning guests should get some kind of perk (upgrade of some sort perhaps?). =) The staff were very nice, always smiling...from cleaning, front desk to the bell staff...couldn't find one grumpy person our entire stay. Everyone was very courteous and willing to help with directions, printed maps, beach towels and local restaurants...anything we needed. Our room was cleaned appropriately, toiletries were refilled everyday...we had no complaints.

I had to call THREE times to get directions to where I was supposed to park and the person I talked to could not give me street names on where I supposed to turn! When I finally found it (unmarked and under a restaurant) I thought I was in the wrong place as it was dark and very cramped. The elevator entrance was actually a utility storage area with cleaning supplies and trash cans and it REAKED of urine! We actually opted to lug our lugguage up the stairs rather than breathe in those fumes!There was no ramp up to the front desk so your only options to get your lugguage up there was to wait in a urine soaked utility area for the elevator or lug up steps. I booked a partial ocean view room (because, come on you're in Hawaii!) and asked for the highest floor possible due to experience with the street noise. Don't waste your money of the ""partial ocean view"". It is literally a sliver between rows of high rises. The room was clean and the wood was nice. The bathroom was small and dated but that seems to be the norm here in Hawaii unless you go to a hotel where you must pay your mortgage for one night.There was no patio really, barely big enough to fit two chairs, but why would you want to sit out and look into high rises?Had to pay $20 for parking in the scary garage. If my husband wasn't with me I wouldn't have gotten out of the car.The location was the only good thing, one block from the International Marketplace.

This is our last night here and I wanted to be sure to share our delight while everything was fresh in my mind. We stayed here a week and the staff is so much of what makes a great hotel one you delight in telling all your friends about. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.The location is perfect, right across from the prestigious Hawiian Hilton Village, this is definitely some of the prettiest beach front in Waikiki. The fireworks off their beach on Friday nights was fantastic- just a few minutes to walk over, this time of year they were Friday at 7:45 but the front desk can let you know if the time is still the same. We walked down to the International Marketplace (just about the center of Waikiki shopping) in 20 - 30 min depending on the whims of the signal lights. There is a car rental place only about a block and a half away with 4 different companies- right on Ala Moana. The IHOP next door is wonderful and we had elected the partial ocean/diamond head view with breakfast- what a great deal. There is a Food Pantry on the block behind the hotel (on Hobron) if you need more than what all the ABC stores (seemingly every block) carry. We saw one group of 10 cooking on the grill down by the pool and having a great time. Loved the apples in the lobby- and the frig in the room- nice big size, not those mini's that you can hardly squeeze anything in. Two other perks that have disappeared from most hotels or never existed that I must mention- this hotel still has ice machines- PLUS, unheard of- a night light in the bathrooms so you don't have to leave the light on with the accompanying fan noise- wish all hotels would include a night light- it's actually the back end of the hairdryer so it doesn't even tie up a plug outlet :0) The free internet in the room is great, I had brought a cord but they have a land line ready for you- maybe not quite as quick as wifi but really fast enough and they included it. There is wifi in the lobby but I never needed to drag my laptop down there.

It was great! The location is right outside of Waikiki so you avoid that traffic. Ala Moana Shopping Center is a 10 minute walk and Waikiki Beach is about a 20 minute walk. I stayed on the 9th floor (room 922). There is street noise you will hear with the balcony doors open like tour buses, trolleys, etc. but I heard little street noise with the sliding glass doors closed. There was one night road crews were doing work with heavy machinery right outside the hotel and once I closed the balcony doors it virtually drowned out all of that noise. I was able to watch TV comfortably that night. The room had a king size bed, pull out couch, desk, table and 3 chairs. There is also a small table and 2 chairs on the balcony. There is a 42 inch TV on the wall. Also has fridge, microwace, and a small safe in the room, which I found very convenient. The staff was super nice! My rental car broke down 4 hours after I got it and I walked to the Aqua Palms to ask if I could check in early to deal with it. Check-in is at 3pm; I got there around noon. They said YES! and it only took about 7 minutes to get me checked in and in my room. The room was very clean and had a better view than I thought. The bathroom is small but adequate. Shower pressure was good. Every time I passed an employee in the halls or in the elevator they always smiled and said hello. Some people have complained about the elevators being slow; I never waited more than 90 seconds going up or down.If I had to pick anything bad -the parking garage is a little small and getting up that entrance ramp with wet tires can be a liitle scary. I would suggest renting a smaller car if you are going to use the parking garage. But that $20/day parking fee is a great deal compared to parking anywhere else around Waikiki.

The bathroom is a bit small, can only fit one person at a time, even just to use the mirror. The ocean view was small and in between buildings, but I still really loved being able to see the water.

I slept in my friend's hospital room for 2 nights before I was able to secure a hotel room for myself until she was released from the hospital. I called Aqua Palms and was able to secure a room for 5 nights. Being this was an unexpected expense I asked if I could get special rates as I had not planned on another hotel expense and funds were low. The Palms worked with me on pricing, and gave me vouchers for meals at the Ihop restaurant which was ajacent to the hotel. The only room they had open at the time only had 1 bed and a sofa bed but they worked with me on getting a room with 2 beds for when my friend was released from the hospital(Wednesday). They moved our luggage from one room to another without hesitation. I was very impressed with the hotel and the staff, they were so friendly and helpful. I felt all alone in Hawaii as I was on my own in a strange place and they made me feel welcome. They printed out directions to the bus stop (to get back and forth to the hospital), gave me directions to other places as well and even printed out our air boarding passes without charge when we were ready to depart Hawaii.The Palms was a lifesaver for me as I had no place to go, I was all alone for a few days. The Desk staff went beyond the call of duty to make me feel comfortable and safe. The room was nice and was cleaned daily. I would have no problem staying there again as my experience was a great one while I stayed there. AQUA PALMS....I thank you very much!","Dearborn Heights, Michigan","Goldie M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dearborn Heights, Michigan</strong>",2,5.0

This hotel is clean and a short walk to Waikiki beach. The beds are very, very comfortable. It's also close to restaurants and stores. The Ala Moana mall is about a 15 minute walk down the street. There is a $20 per day parking fee in their garage, which is pretty tight but is manageable if you have a small car. I really like that the price is very affordable and it is so close to everything. Service is friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.","Fairbanks, Alaska","bmayo25</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fairbanks, Alaska</strong>",1,5.0

We had decided to splurge on a nice bed and hot shower before we had to get on a plane for a day, and settled on Aqua Palms as a good value and close enough to the airport. We though it was particularly worth the extra splurge because we didn't see a charge for parking anywhere on the website (almost every other hotel in Waikiki does). Apparently there is a $20 per day charge to park in their garage, which I urge the management to put on the website asap, because that probably would have affected our booking decision. As it was, when we checked in and found out about the parking charge, the guy at the front desk was awesome and comp'ed the parking for us because of the confusion. Given how exhausted we were after our trip, this was a much appreciated gesture.The room had a really comfortable bed and amazing hot shower with good water pressure. This place seemed a little better suited for longer stays since there was plenty of space and storage in our room for a multiple week stay, and I'd definitely recommend it for that type of trip. Overall the room was updated, spacious and comfortable, the price reasonable, and the service fantastic. They even let us park there after check out so we could walk around a bit before taking the car to the airport for our later flight, and were great to deal with on the phone when we wanted to change our reservation to a better deal we saw on their site.","San Jose, California","katenz87</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",4,4.0

We were here 3 years ago and felt it was a good value, good location and decided to spend the month of February here again. The hotel website pretty well describes their amenities but what I especially enjoyed was the free daily newspaper, free daily coffee packets, free room safe (large enough for a lap top plus other valuables free in room internet and free Wi Fi in the lobby. Many other hotels have a daily amenities fee for these services. Staff was extremely helpful, friendly and polite. During the on line registrations I had several question I sent via e-mail. Erik S in reservations was always prompt in answering my questions. General Manager, Patty Maher, hosted drinks and chips along with entertainment every Thursday. She made everyone feel comfortable and said she was available at any time to handle any problems that arose that her staff could not resolve.We decided to elect the Diamond Head accommodations, which included breakfast vouchers for 2 at the I Hop restaurant located on the first level of the hotel.The hotel information did not elaborate on the vouchers, but here is how it worked. You were given a voucher at check in for each day of you stay. You had three choices: 1) two eggs, any style, two slices of bacon or two sausage links and two pancakes. 2) French Toast 3 slices (6 halves) 3) Oatmeal with milk, brown sugar and 2 slices of toast. You had a choice of coffee, or orange juice. Portions were ample. All servers were acquainted with the vouchers and there was never any hassle. Gratuity was included The vouchers could be used for any meal and could also be used as a $7.00 credit toward any other item on the menu.

First the pros - the staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. I can't say enough nice things about them. The pink trolley stops right in front of the hotel. The overall location was good for us - we walked to the beach, park, ala moana shopping center and many restaurants all within 15 min or less. In the lobby you can get free regular coffee and free apples. Also you can request beach towels for no charge.The cons - the room was small and showed wear. Nothing like the picture on the web. I have a picture of a spot of mold growing on the wallpaper below my headboard. The bathtub was really gross having been re-enameled but with most of the enamel peeling off. Even after bleaching out before every use I felt bad giving my toddler a bath in it. The balcony was extremely dangerous for my 2 year old - her head and entire body fit easily through the bars. I don't know what the code is for this (maybe it's standard?) but I would not let her outside at all which further cut down on our very tight living space. The in room coffee pot is ok, it's small and enough for maybe two cups of coffee. The pool was also small but adequate but because of a building across the street it loses sun for appx. 2-3 hours a day (about 1:30-3:30pm). The free wifi internet only works in the lobby. Overall, If I came back to this island I would not stay at the Aqua Palms again.","Anchorage, Alaska","jdubb77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anchorage, Alaska</strong>",4,3.0

I've stayed at the Aqua Palms twice and I've been satisfied. There's free coffee available and a weekly ""Managers Reception"" in the lobby from 5-6 pm that offers a free cocktail, snacks and live music. I'd definitely stay here again.

Like other reviewers had mentioned the hotel is in need of renovations. That being said the place is scrupulously clean, the staff is friendly and approachable and the manager truly cares about the comfort and satisfaction of her guests. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and would likely not even look at staying elsewhere if I were fortunate enough to return to Honolulu. From the complimentary apples and lemon ice water in the foyer to the Managers reception on Thursdays with live entertainment, drinks and snacks, attention is paid to every detail to ensure a pleasant stay for their clientele. I've travelled a fair amount and have stayed at some very posh hotels but have never felt more comfortable. If you care about a five star appearance this may not be the place for you. If you care about being treated like a five star guest this is the place for you. Maholo to Patty and her staff for making our trip such a pleasant one. On our last day of holidays we met an elderly gentleman who told us about a place at the Ala Moana Shopping Centre called Shirokiya (it's beside Macy's and within walking distance of the hotel). It is two stories of a variety of fresh Japenese foods that are very inexpensive and a nice change to what is available at the local ABC stores. Also we were prepared to rent a car for at least a portion of our trip. It turns out that their transit system is very efficient. You can literally go anywhere you want to on the island for $2.50 (exact change required). The concierge can help you with the schedule. The Expedia representatives are very helpful as well. Of course they would like to sell you their tours and if you want a hassle free way to go that may be desirable. We found it wasn't any big deal to take the bus. We went to the North Shore, The Polynesian Cultural Centre, Pearl Harbor, Chinatown, The Bishop Museum to name just a few (all accessed by bus). We only travelled during the day so never felt vulnerable. There were some pretty interesting locals on the buses, friendly and willing to give advice about places they would recommend to visit.","Saskatoon, Saskatchewan","Happytravellers88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saskatoon, Saskatchewan</strong>",35,5.0
