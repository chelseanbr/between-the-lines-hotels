I was an IHG Elite Gold Member at the time. Room was ok - clean and comfortable. Maybe smaller than the average Holiday Inn Express room. Other than that everything was ok. However what I experienced the morning of check-out was quite disrespectful. I had checked out and was waiting on my pick-up - and this was 15 minutes before the start of breakfast. Most of the breakfast items were already on display. I approached the counter to get a banana and coffee and was rebuked by a member of staff. It's like she made a real big deal and told me not to take any of the items and wait. I tried to explain but she was adamant and spoke little English - mostly Spanish. Really, I just wonder what is happening with New York hotels? Are they losing their hospitality?","Silver Spring, Maryland","Steve Y</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Silver Spring, Maryland</strong>",373,2.0

Upon arrival I was told my booking was incomplete and that I needed to pay an extra $100 I said I had a receipt for the price that I paid and asked the man at the desk if he would like to see it. He said ‘no it’s fine I will sort it.’ He then asked me to pay a $50 hold fee once I finished the transaction he said my card was declined. He took my card again not sure what he did with it but he said everything was fine and gave me my room key. Once in my room he phoned to tell me the transaction went through twice I checked my account and could see the transaction had actually gone through 3 times charging me $150 this came up as pending. He said he would not be able to refund it himself but to ask a manager the next day. The next day a lady at the front desk reversed a $50 charge which came off immediately but the $100 came out as a full charge and was no longer pending like a hold fee should. On the 3rd day of my stay I explained the charge was now complete and had not been removed. A lady at the desk kindly attempted to refund it manually however she refunded it to the wrong card charging me another $100.I tried to explain that I now had a $200 charge on my card but staff seemed to refuse to believe me. Or brushed it off and said all charges had been reversed. This became very frustrating as I trusted they knew what they were doing but clearly not. I only stayed at the hotel for 5 days and felt I was constantly chasing them up for money taken off my card for no reason.Once arriving back home in the UK I made contact with the hotel and they explained that they could refund $100 and the other $100 should come off after 7 business days of checking out. I waited for this time but it didn’t not come off. I again made contact with the hotel but was just met with a lazy response of ‘I will make sure it reversed’ I then asked how long this would take as I could not afford to pay off $100 on my card that I was not supposed to. Eventually this hotel stopped replying to my emails. I then made contact with booking.com who have now refunded this money for me but I am unsure why Holiday inn has not replied to my emails at least to explain why they couldn’t refund it themselves.This whole experience ruined my trip to New York. Such poor customer service that has really stressed me out as this is a lot of money to have to pay off when I was not supposed to. After all of this I have not even received an apology. I would not recommend this hotel.,"London, United Kingdom","Leanna C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",5,1.0

The hotel did refund us but, due to the foreign currency transaction fees charged by the bank, we ended up around $50 short.

Only took 1 bus as it was almost as slow as walking.Breakfast was annoying, the dining area is way too small for the hotel, we went down 8:15 and there were no seats free and the place only got busier for the next hour. Something needs to be done.The room was fine, fresh sheets and towels every day, popcorn and water during the afternoons at reception, although this seemed to disappear on a night so I ended up paying 4 dollars for a water at reception to take to bed.Unfortunately the coffee never seemed to get topped up late morning and only decaf was left.The lifts were slow and we decided to walk to the third floor every time because of this.TV was good, used it once during a rainy day, got sports channels and movies.Luggage was stored until 4pm on our final day before catching our flight home which helped a lot.There is a gym to the right of the lifts near reception. Popped my head in and found some kids bouncing on the exercise balls using them like space hoppers, pretty much pointless going in there. Think there was just a treadmill and another couple of cardio bits.Theres a fridge in the room.Bed was very firm with 2 big pillows and I found it hard to sleep with them. 1 firm one soft. Neither was nice.The shower was amazing, very powerful, I think the water was very hard so take moisturiser and something for your lips if you're going in winter, mine chapped up in a day.Overall a decent stay but nothing special. Have to say the breakfast situation annoyed me the most though, standing with a paper plate waiting for a seat, queues for the pancake machine, and toaster.

Reasons below why we would not stay at this hotel again:- although expecting smaller room, we were shocked how small a room for a family would be. 2 adults and 2 teenagers with all our luggage was almost impossible. Room size would of been fine had it of been for 2 people with only 1 bed.- on first day we realised that the bath plug switch did not work to stop water escaping meaning we could only take showers. I know this is not the end of the world but given the miles of walking each day and sore feet, a hot bath at the end of it was preferred. Reported this issue to reception several times but nobody came to resolve in the 5 nights we were there. - we opted out of room cleaning on Christmas Day to give cleaning staff a day off, however, the sign sheet advised that reception would be available should you need anything. We required a fresh towel, which was requested and was advised it would be brought up to room, but it never arrived! - we were fully aware as per previous reviews that breakfast service would be busy so on the few days we got up extra early, we managed to get seats. A few days we opted to grab food to take back to room due to how busy it was, which we were happy to do but did not appreciate constantly being barged out the way by staff refilling the buffet items ( at one point being literally pinned against cupboard by cupboard door member of staff was trying to get something in to) All above points above would’ve been raised at checkout, however no “how was your stay?” Etc that we are used to when staying at other holiday inns so simply took that as last straw in us not returning the next time we are in New York. During our USA trip we went on to stay at 3 other ihg hotels and had great experiences so extremely disappointed that this is where we chose for our Xmas break when there several other ihg alternatives within the city.

Two beds with four people and we were crawling over (literally) each other and our suitcases. Beds were ok, room was clean but way too small for four people. I would equate the size to a cruise ship cabin. For triple the price. Also, we witnessed one of the breakfast food workers repeatedly being rude to customers who were trying to get food after 930am cut off. But they were literally still putting food out, had no signs that said breakfast was now closed, turned off the lights or anything. This guy was talking under his breath about customers. One of the patrons asked him a question. He answered polite enough and then stated “That was a stupid question” as she turned and walked away. The patron didn’t hear him, but we certainly did. He was angry at customers and was extremely rude directly to them and behind their back. Not what I expect after paying nearly 1000 for three nights. ",,BZig813,0,2.0

Very dated interior; we called it our 1970s room. Tiny bathroom but shower good and good pressure. Breakfast not good- paper plates and plastic cutlery and a very small area with 3 hot food offerings plus pancake & toaster machine. Some dried muffins and some cereals. The hot food was very very dry and not particularly pleasant. For all that however, our room was spotless& the staff friendly. We had problems with the air con and the safe and the staff resolved them immediately. The location really is good- 15 minute walk from Times Square etc and some great places to eat and drink literally around the block.

The hotel's response to Expedia (who I had e.mailed on day 1 and who called me back at 5am on day 3!!!) was that the construction was not on the hotel premises so was not their problem. Try telling that to a guest that cannot get to sleep past 6.30am each day. Also on morning 3 it was 5am when the first concrete trucks arrived.

It was surprisingly bigger than I expected and have had before in NY so this was a bonus. We found it to be comfortable and being at the back of the hotel it was quiet throughout our stay.

It’s walkable to most midtown sights and the subway. It’s about a 10min walk to the nearest subway but that’s nothing. The breakfast was well....busy. Go down early if you want hot food. We didn’t eat much usually just taken coffee and a muffin or banana up to our room but that was fine for us and all we wanted. On the last day we saw people taking popcorn from the reception area and asked them how much it was. They told me it was free!! We wasn’t informed of this by reception on check in and that was a bit disappointing as it was our last day and it was all gone at this point. Lift is always busy so take the stairs when you canAvoid the 1st floor at all costs. It’s actually ground floor and right near the reception... It must be very noisy.The heating could probably do with being replaced as it turns itself on and off, then suddenly it would come out cold so not very consistent.

We were just going to leave our luggage in their storage room, but luckily, the room was ready, so we could check in early. We were there for 6 days, and never had one issue. When we check out, they held our luggage in their luggage storage room from 6:30 am till 5 pm, as our plane did not leave till 7:30. The place was clean, they had free hot breakfast, it was only a 10 minute walk to subway, and about 15 minutes to Times Square. Would stay there again without hesitation. I am not saying it is The Four Seasons, but it was a very good value. Would actually have given it 4.5 stars, but was not given the option. Only complaint is the room size, but we had two double beds. I am sure that a room with only 1 king or 1 queen would have been a little roomier. Also, if you are going to eat breakfast there, go early. It is a small dining area, and gets packed, although we were able to find a table for 4 every morning.",,bdfsu157,20,4.0

The staff were friendly and nice, happily looked after our bags on our last day while we waited for our flight home but that was probably the highlight. The room decor is seriously outdated, the bathroom needed a good clean and so did the walls. Found hairs in the bathroom and there was marks on the walls which looked like they could have easily been wiped off. The heating worked well but during the night would turn itself on every 30 minutes or so to maintain temperature and was noisy. The hotel was noisy in general and my sleep suffered. Im a heavy sleeper and can usually sleep anywhere but this was probably the worst sleep ive had in a hotel. Would wake every hour or so due to noise of either the heater, people coming into the hotel, sirens, cars, people rowing from outside the Salvation Army across the road. And this was being on the 11th floor. Maybe the hotel could provide ear plugs? The bed itself was comfortable so with earplugs it may have been a lot better. The hotel does not have a bar or serve food other than breakfast which is a little disappointing. The lift situation isn't the best either. 2 lifts for the whole hotel and they will stop on every floor when you use them. Breakfast was ok but the dining area is small. I would recommend either going early or late. Dining at 8am resulted in us having to share our table with other people as there was no where to sit. The location is ok. Anywhere you go from here will be a long walk unless you are happy to get a taxi. A few blocks over there is a road full of reasonably priced restaurants and bars which is the highlight for this hotel. Would I stay here again? No. I wouldn't recommend the hotel either unless it was to visit family or as a one night stay. Id rather pay more money and stay in a better hotel where I can actually sleep and have a civilised breakfast.

The street itself is pleasant enough, though the presence of a salvation army hostel directly opposite might put some people off.

There was also a big retro-fitted aircon unit which worked well, but was really noisy through the night. Unfortunately the weather was too hot and humid to do without it.Otherwise it was all good.

This is good if you like local dining and nightlife areas, bad if you are homophobic (Hell’s Kitchen is gayville central). It is ~10min walk to either Time Square or Port Authority Bldg. The best way to reach the hotel is Uber from the airport (~$50-60 from EWR and less from others) or you can take NJ transit train to Penn station ($13/pp from EWR) then Uber or take airport bus to Port Authority (~$18/pp.) and walk 10min.Room & Bath: Let me start with clearly noting that the room and bath are both undersized - even given the fact it is NYC. We have stayed at many properties in the city (>8) and most rooms are smaller than average in general - but I would consider this property unacceptable. You have basically small walking lanes around the bed and that is about it. The bathroom is undersized, particularly the sink area. If you have any expectation to spread out your ‘stuff’ around the sink, you are in for a surprise. This is one of my big pet peeves and would prevent me from staying here again. The shower is reasonable but has the typical low flow HIE head. Lastly, the bathroom door didn’t want to stay open on our room and kept hitting me in the butt every 5-10sec. I had to stuff a wet hand towel on the floor to keep it open. Amenities (wifi, gym, pool, etc.): Didn’t check the connection speed for the Wi-Fi but I would call it ok.. There is no pool of course. Keeping with the theme of smallest, the gym at this hotel is basically useless unless you want to use a treadmill. There is no room to even put a mat on the floor to stretch and no weights or exercise equipment of value. Food & Beverage: They have a small area (undersized area for the room count) for the free breakfast. It was very crowded whether we came near end of the breakfast period or 1.5hrs before. There is a reasonably nice outdoor sitting area which is also used as overflow for breakfast seating. That was nice, assuming the weather is nice enough and you don’t mind eating with smokers…. They do serve coffee and tea all day long. Staff & Service Level: The staff were actually pleasant and did their best to answer my various questions (and request to check-out early). The front desk staff would be the strong point here even though they do not have a dedicated concierge. Misc.: For a beautiful view of the city (and expensive drinks), try the Press Lounge just down 48th street Would I Repeat?: No. Even though I expect smaller rooms in NYC, the room and bathroom here were just too small to be acceptable.

This was a PERFECT location for walking to that activity, and it turns out it was a great location for most of everything else that we did.From our arrival, when Josie was super helpful and friendly (as she has been described in many other reviews as well), to the breakfast and cleaning staff, everyone here was very courteous and polite. The room was not SPOTLESS (half a bar of soap missed in the back corner behind the sink) but we didn't feel it was grungy - I would say average cleanliness. Room was the perfect size for the three of us, although the sofa bed was not super comfortable. Adequate for a child to sleep on. King bed was incredibly comfortable. Pillows were only feather so they were super smushy but it worked for the 3 nights. Longer term, we probably would have preferred foam pillows. Biggest drawback for sleeping was our location right next to the elevator - please request a room away from the elevator - the noise definitely woke us during the night.TV reception was disappointing - directv keep cutting in and out, regardless of weather (we have directv at home, so we understand that heavy clouds can block the dish - this was not the case). As a side note here - to operate the tv remote, point it BELOW the desk. For some reason, that's where the receiver is for the directv. Thanks to maintenance for their patience with us - lol.Mini fridge and Keurig in the room. No drawers other than one small one in each nightstand, small space to hang clothes. Small safe in room. Breakfast was average, but definitely helped as we didn't have to spend money each morning on breakfast. Sausage, scrambled eggs (add salt), pancakes, breads, fruit, yogurt. Definitely enough to fill up, and carry you through to dinner with just small snack during the day. As others mentioned, the dining area is small but we were able to find a table each morning. Other guests were bringing food up to their rooms - the hotel provided trays for this.Back to the location - we walked to the Intrepid museum in about 10 minutes. Times Square was a solid 15 minutes but we didn't mind. Broadway (Gershwin Theater) was 20 minutes, and Rockefeller Plaza was just past that so maybe 25 min. Subway stop (50th and 8th) was about a 10 minute walk, and then from there the subway was 25 minutes down to South Ferry for the Statue of Liberty, or 10 minutes Uptown to Museum of Natural History.In the neighborhood, I highly recommend the Westfield Market, one block East on 48th and 11th. We made a few stops there, for adult beverages, bottled water, lunch foods (delicious salads, sandwiches, warm foods). We also had dinner at Patzeria (also up 48th about 1 1/2 blocks) one night - it was so good, we got New York style pizza there the next night for takeout.If you are considering a hotel in the Times Square or Broadway area, please consider this Holiday Inn.

It was a typical Holiday Inn Express -- basic services, small rooms, clean, good service, so no complaints. Summary:1) The location isn't TOO far away from Times Square and other popular areas but it is a bit of a hike to do too often. The subway was about a 10-minute walk which is okay but not ideal.2) It's in a kind of quiet neighborhood, which seemed safe enough. We typically like to be in a more bustling neighborhood in NYC so we wanted something about 2 avenues east, where there are many more restaurants/bars (though there is a nice rooftop lounge just west). But if you like quiet, this works fine.3) The rooms were small, which I guess is typical Holiday Inn Express / NYC. It was okay after we figured out how to place the luggage; we weren't there that often anyway. Beds / room were clean. The noise level on the outside rooms (we were on 9th) were a bit loud but from usual NYC traffic sounds, not nightlife.4) The free breakfast buffet was better than most of these with scrambled eggs, sausage, etc. There wasn't a lot else. The main thing I didn't like was how small and ""competitive"" the room is -- go before 8am if you can. Elevators were small and a bit slow.If you're okay with all of the above, this is a very good value and like I say, good staff and clean.

The room was clean and comfortable enough, though small. The breakfast was nice, though the breakfast room was far too small for the number of guests that wanted breakfast -- kind of a zoo down there.The location is convenient to Times Square area attractions... we enjoyed the walk.

We're from upstate NY, so we should know the area; but this was a bit further west than we realized. Our fault, not theirs. It's almost 11th Avenue and the street from 9th avenue to the hotel is quiet with people in doorways. Nothing bad happened, but I wouldn't walk it alone late at night after a show. We're also older, so the long block felt very long after a full day. A good choice for a younger couple or male.The hotel itself was great. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was NYC style small, but was fine. The elevators has a sign about using them off-peak and I could see where two small elevators would be a problem if large numbers of people tried to use them at the same time. It was not a real problem for us. This is true in a lot of NYC hotels, so not a big deal. The signs were a cute warning.Breakfast was Holiday Inn express standard.

Something I really value. There is a gym, but I didn’t use it.The only downsides I found were:1(a). If one arrives after 08:00 for b/fast, there are too few seats for the number of guests. Also some solo guests sit at tables for four, which often denies three others from sitting.I was proactive, when seeing no free tables, I asked one gentleman if I could share his large table, and he can consented, but I fear that many seniors would not be confident in asking as I did.(b) Also, some folk I found linger at the table long, way too long after they finished eating. Again, displaying a lack of courtesy to other guests.2. The hotel b/w 10th and 11th avenues is a good distance from the subway at 50th & 8th (C and E trains). Guests may want to factor in cab fares to and from that stop. It was not enjoyable to walk in the snow.That said, if you’re arriving at or departing from Penn Station, the hotel is a short ride straight up 10th Avenue, some 14 blocks. Just like I found in February, the downsides are small and are outweighed by the good value rooms and sterling customer service.Even with the less than ideal location, I will be back.

First there were some stains on the bathroom wall that were a little icky. Our room was113 - literally the closest to the lobby, some type of staff closet/supply area, and breakfast area. I realize that the hotel was also sold out that day, so choices were limited and somebody has to take the room but maybe something could be done for noise. It was fine until about 2 AM, when I was kept awake by staff knocking and banging things around all night. Then around 6 AM, the chairs being moved around non-stop in the breakfast area and people talking was a lot. Thankfully my husband had ear plugs so we could do something about it. But maybe the hotel should provide this to these rooms or have courtesy signs asking people to be quiet. Staff should not be making so much noise at 2 AM. I expressed my concerns to the front desk, who just shrugged and agreed that the room location is the worst.

The room is not huge, but big enough. Would have wanted more closet space, since we were staying for a week and we couldnt really unpack. Also a shelf for my toiletries would be nice. But not a big deal!The location is great. Close to everything. The staff is great, so helpfull and nice. The breakfast is very limited, but the coffee is great and i available all day and night. The thing that worried me was the amount of plastic and other disposibles. The breakfast used plastic disposible cups for the drinks and plastic diposable cutlery. Everything was disposable. Even the glass in my room was plastic, and wrapped in more plastic. I shivver just thinking about the amount of people i saw at breakfast, and how much just straight non-recycable trash that is thrown way each and every day. It was just way to much disposable plastic, which was dissapointing. I understand that it is practical, but it is so easy to change and it just was not good enough. Its a big hotel, and they have a big footprint. So i gave to hotel an OK rating, because of the people who work there. But wouldnt recomend to a friend. If they change and become more sustainable i would be happy to recomend them, but i wont stay or recomend this hotel to anyone in its current disposible state.I hope that more people will comment and pressure them to change this practise.","Bergen, Norway","kajasviland</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bergen, Norway</strong>",0,3.0

I was surprised at the size of the room as I'd heard that rooms in New York were on the small size. We had a good sized wardrobe, but only 6 hangers, a desk, flat screen TV, fridge and a Keurig coffee maker. The bed was made daily but I had to leave a note for housekeeping to leave us more coffee and I'm pretty sure that although they emptied the bins daily they didn't actually hoover the carpet. Lovely big shower in the bathroom with good water pressure, nice white fluffy towels but only a small area around the sink to put our toiletries so we ended up leaving them in our washbags. A buffet breakfast was include in our room rate and the food was basic but acceptable with a choice of a cooked meal as well as cereal and toast, muffin or bagel and even freshly made pancakes. The coffee/tea section was available 24/7 which was useful when the coffee in our room wasn't replaced. The breakfast area is small and seats are at a premium at least 3 out of the 7 days we were there we had to grab our breakfast and take it outside to the patio area to eat. The weather while we were there was around 25-30 degrees so eating outside wasn't much of a problem but I wouldn't fancy having to do that any later in the year.Location wise the hotel is opposite a Salvation Army hostel which I was a little apprehensive about but which was in fact absolutely fine. It's about a 20 minute walk to Times Square and the nearest subway station and being in Hell's Kitchen there are plenty of places around to eat. Eating in New York we found was very expensive but the fact that the room had a fridge meant that we could buy supplies from the grocery stores, keep them in there and then eat in our room. The hotel had no problem with guests bringing back food and eating it either in their room or in the hotels breakfast area.Staff in the hotel from reception to housekeeping were all very pleasant and friendly. The receptionist helped organise our airport transfer and also arranged for our luggage to be stored until we were ready to depart for the airport.The hotel has vending machines and ice machines on every other floor and a limited range of drinks and snacks can be purchased from reception.If you are looking for a hotel with a view then this is not it, however for the price I paid it was really good value for money and in a good location, if I had wanted luxury I would probably of had to pay 3 times the price.","Leominster, United Kingdom","Linda_Davies46</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leominster, United Kingdom</strong>",6,3.0

The only small problem we had was when we tried to use one lift and it wasn't working, so we waited for the next one, only to be told by Sandra Anne ? That we didn't know how to use the lift and that there was nothing wrong with it. So back in it we went, waited two minutes for Sandra Anne to realize that in fact it wasn't working, like we had already told her, however It was back in service by the time we came back to the hotel later that day. I travelled with my 17 year old daughter and had a room with a king size bed, which was more than adequate for the both of us to share. We stayed for 6 nights. The fact that breakfast is included is a huge bonus and the variety on offer Is great.

Another option is to take a bus that makes the direction North-South along 10th and 11th avenues. For example if you go to Lincoln Center take a bus, much more practical and walks little. The stop is just around the corner. If you will stay 5 or more days BUY a 7-day ticket (used in bus and subway at will)The strong point I found at the Hotel was the attendance of the staff.

The only lack for Brazilians is that they do not have express coffee. Coffee is american style, weaker. And if you need something extra, do not be shy about asking. I ordered chocolate powder and they brought me, I saw people asking for boiled egg, asking to warm milk. They are very helpful, not ""ugly"" when you ask for something extra.The room is very nice, modern and comfortable. My only complaint for a perfect stay was the noise in the room. Incredible as it may seem it is not the noise of the street, but the noise of the corridor. There is virtually no soundproofing from the bedroom to the hallway. You hear everything that goes on outside and what bothers the most is the doors being closed, because they are in the style of pull and knock to close, with metallic noise.

We arrived early and wanted to drop off our bags, but the front desk had our room ready and allowed us to check in very early. They were incredibly attentive and friendly. The room was small but lovely, modern and pleasant. The breakfast was the same breakfast you get at all HIEs, but this breakfast room was hopping and they kept everything full and neat and tidy.

Anesha and Josie are rock stars!!! I hope you're fortunate enough to have them help you if you have any issues during your stay. In my book, this hotel gets 5 stars all around for their excellent staff and their facility.The extended version: My family and I (10 people total) planned a short trip to New York for my brother's graduation last week. Six of us stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Manhattan Midtown West. Since I currently reside in Tennessee where we're used to having space, very little street noise, and easy access to our cars, I was a bit nervous about coordinating this trip. I didn't want everyone to hate me if: a) we got stuck in a small room designed for two people and 0 suitcases; b) our hotel was surrounded by sketchiness, or; c) if we couldn't get around New York easily without having to take a taxi everywhere. Thankfully, this hotel was perfect for what we needed. First, the rooms with two queen beds were perfect for three; the king room with the sofa bed was also great for three. There was even enough room for our suitcases. For six adults with a short stay, this was perfect.Next, the hotel is not surrounded by sketchiness, woohoo! Instead, it's located near some good eats (W 48th and 10th Ave) and Ink48's sexy rooftop bar with a great view of the Hudson River (W 48th and 11th Ave). Yes, there's a Salvation Army across the street, but it doesn't make the area any more/less sketchy than the rest of midtown.Finally, we could get around easily either on foot, via the subway, or with a Lyft/Uber. How you get around just depends on where you're trying to go, and how much you're trying to spend. For my brother's graduation, we took an Uber to get to his school, but we walked or took the subway almost everywhere else. Especially when traffic is heavy, it just makes more sense to walk. Columbus Circle, where we entered Central Park, was 20 minutes on foot. Times Square was about a 10 minute walk. Broadway is less than 10 minutes away. Overall, the location was excellent in my opinion.Here are the tips that I'd recommend to help you enjoy your stay:1. Book early and call with any requests that you might have. We asked for a higher floor to minimize street noise, and we were placed on the 7th floor. The staff here will actually try to accommodate your requests.2. If you have an issue, let the staff know as soon as possible so they can help you resolve it. And don't be a jerk to them while they're trying to help--phenomenal staff members like Anesha and Josie will go above and beyond to try and get things to work out in your favor. 3. If you want the complimentary breakfast, get there before 9. Yes, it's a little chaotic because there are so many people and so few tables, but they're trying to do the best with the space they have. Feel free to treat the seating on the patio as an overflow area if the weather allows it.4. If you have a late flight on the day that you check out, ask to leave your luggage behind the concierge while you hang out in the city. Anthony, one of the other awesome employees at this hotel, let us know that this was an option the evening before we checked out.This is not a swanky boutique hotel, so if you're looking for a place with upscale accents all over, you're likely to be disappointed. But I found the service, space, and location to be great for this price point and at this time of the year.","Nashville, Tennessee","Oluchi_N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>",2,4.0

The hotel's location is not very convenient. While it's between 10th & 11th Avenues, it's closer to the latter, which means farther from not only the subway and major bus lines, but also from restaurants and interesting things to do.At check-in, I got either someone who was in training, or just didn't care very much. Regardless, I was able to get into my room, drop off my stuff, and then head out to grab dinner. As a place to sleep in the city, it's fine. The walls/doors are super thin, though, and I had poor luck in that I was next to some group who liked to keep their door open while chatting loudly.Luckily I was on the 11th floor. If you're not on that floor, good luck getting into an elevator during prime breakfast/check-out times. On multiple days during the mornings, the elevator would pretty much stop on every floor, most of which didn't allow people to get on because the elevator was already packed to the gills. There are only two (slow) elevators servicing the entire building.As for the service -- the maintenance/housekeeping crew could use some work. On the positive front, the guy who brought me soap the first night came up pretty quickly. The negative side of it -- one maintenance guy couldn't be bothered to move to the side when I got off the elevator. I had to squeeze past him and his mop because he simply refused to move. Another instance of interesting staff attitude -- I got the elevator once with a maintenance guy (different person) who was mumbling and cussing like he was super angry.Anyway, this is a Holiday Inn Express, so it's not like one should expect much of anything. For this brand, this is about on par with expectations. I won't be staying here again, though, as the rates weren't even that good. I'd rather pay the same money but stay in a better location.","Arcadia, California","dagongster</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arcadia, California</strong>",93,3.0

Positives:- Tea and Coffee 24/7 downstairs- Good shower cubicle and decent shower head- Fridge (I'm diabetic, so to keep insulin cool the fact they provide a fridge is great)- Ice (it was cold when we were there so limited use, but when we left, again, as I am diabetic, being able to put some ice next to my insulin to keep it cool is a great help)- Safe - Access to microwave downstairs.Negatives- Internet was not very good - okay when it worked, but sometimes seemed to lose signal. It was upgraded the day before we left, so we don't know whether things have improved. Internet was always good in the breakfast area, but just that reception in the rooms was poor, so if the WiFi got upgraded to have better reach within the building then it should be good now.- No kettle. They provide a coffee making machine, but a hotel is a home away from home and every home has a kettle before a coffee making machine. Without a kettle you can't make tea, or a hot water bottle or have some warm water with you before you set out. - The room is very small. If you're travelling alone, it would not be a concern and I'd give this 5 stars. If you're travelling as a couple or as a family with a young child, I would keep it at 4 stars. The walkable space in the room is very small. From the table to the end of the bed is the width of a chair. Once you have your luggage opened up and taken off your shoes etc, it feels like you feel very closed in with no space. This can make you feel less relaxed at times.- Not good for women - some of this comes back to space, some of it that women have more stuff. If we take the bathroom for example, there is no space for anything other than your toothbrush as its a small space, so my wife then puts her bag on top of the back of the toilet. If you go into the main room, if the woman sits at the table, the lighting isn't good enough for her to do her makeup.In terms of distance from the hotel, I chose this hotel because it was also close to the National Retail Federation event at Jacob K. Javits Convention Center as well as Times Square. Times Square is about 12 minutes away at a brisk walk, or closer to 18 minutes with a stroller. In hind sight we might have been better off getting a hotel in the centre of Times Square.Feedback for improvements:- When you serve breakfast, to ensure you have enough space, you remove the microwave. Stop doing that. You have a line of parents asking for either milk to be heated up for their children or adults who want to eat the porridge you provide which has a requirement to add water or milk and microwave for 2 minutes to ask the staff to microwave the porridge.- You provide 24/7 hot drinks. The problem is that the water always runs out. You have 6 canisters of coffee but one hot water tap that is manually filled and easily runs out. Can you not either get the 2nd one you use in the morning next to the porridge to be in use also or have something plugged in permanently with water and boiling facilities. It's a waste of staff's time constantly pouring water into these machines if they've detected its empty.Overall, a great stay, but just one that could have been better.","Leicester, United Kingdom","ShaoChan1902</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leicester, United Kingdom</strong>",89,4.0

I traveled from Florida where I live to New York City the weekend of my 21st birthday. As an IHG CLUB MEMBER and front desk employee of another Holiday Inn/former HSKP, I had high expectations and standards. Josie at the front desk was super sweet! It was just the day before I was to be 21 and she let me check in with no issues (I was very concerned about that prior to the trip). She also disappeared and returned bearing a little IHG bag containing a few snacks and candies, offering it to me as a ""birthday gift"" and I felt very special after that sentiment. The room was absolutely lovely. I was upgraded to the King with Sofa Bed room and they put me on the 9th floor, close to the elevator and ice machine, and it was perfect. The room was very clean and spacious, with a mini fridge and Keurig. The TV selection wasn't great, in my opinion, and I had more trouble staying connected to the WiFi internet than it was worth, so I ended up using most of my data through my carrier which was annoying. Spent more time in the room just hanging than I thought I would, but it was just so comfortable and spacious, which is not typical for NYC hotels. I adored the bathrooms, too, even the bathroom door was very nice and interesting. I felt like the room was just very luxurious. I didn't try breakfast at the hotel at all, we missed it everyday oversleeping. We walked down to the Kimpton hotel just down the block and took the elevator all the way up to the 30th-something floor to their rooftop lounge and though the drinks totaled $50! it was beautiful and well worth it. The view up there offered 360-views of NYC and the skyline was out of this world. Exiting the hotel and going the other way, there is a multitude of 24-hour convenience stores. On my first day I got a really good Philly Cheesesteak at one, and I grabbed a coupon yogurt granola parfaits to throw in the fridge for mornings. We also had dinner one night at this great Italian restaurant within walking distance from hotel, I think it was called Melograno. There was a liquor store AND a smoke shop just within walking distance too. It was perfect. Only thing I didn't really like is that it was 3 LONG blocks from Times Square. Not too far but we only walked there maybe twice or three times. It was a trek and next time I'd prefer something more midtown, closer to the Empire State Building and IN Times Square. But overall good stay and I really enjoyed everything.",,Alana T,0,4.0

Only 3 blocks from Times Square, we never needed to walk far to anything at all, and we were constantly passing the theatres, meaning they were easily accessible, too.The front desk staff was friendly and extremely willing to help with information about the area, plus they were there to provide extra amenities at any time. While our room was small, you are not going to find anything large in NYC unless you're willing to spend a small fortune for that space, and it was still well-appointed and comfortable. Everything was conveniently placed in the room, and I was pleased to find a Keurig for my coffee fixes; there was, as is typical, also a breakfast area on the first floor that included 24-hour coffee. As for this breakfast, it included a variety of hot and cold options and was surprisingly good. The food was tasty, and there was a nice variety of drink options, too. It is pretty rare to find hotels in NYC with breakfast included, so to have any at all is a surprise, to have a good one is shocking.

I have no idea.... We showed up (2adults/2 kids - 8 & 12) at 11:30 at night, exhausted but ready to kick off the Christmas season by spending a few days in NYC. I will say that a man who was working the front desk that night was great - very helpful. First impression of the hotel - NO WAY. Terrible lobby. Small is okay, I get it - it's NYC and sometimes I actually like a small hotel; quaint, personal, but this was dingy and depressing. 2 elevators - 1 was broken. A young gentleman who was working there said something to the effect of ""It's always braking. Should be fixed by morning."" No thanks, we are not riding an elevator that is ""always breaking"". Get to our room (or should I say cell?) and it was TEENEY TINY and the smell was AWFUL. All I could think of was cat urine. Back to the lobby we go. Next room - well, it didn't smell like urine but it did smell like ridiculously heavy chemical laden ""cleaning"" chemicals, like a cheap, lemon air freshener. Back to the lobby we went. No other rooms available and it was now after midnight. Having no place else to go it was back up to the ""lemon cell"". After an awful nights sleep we checked out and immediately starting looking for a new hotel. I would not reccomend this hotel unless you get it for a very cheap price and don't mind tiny, musty spaces. Did I mention there was no closet in the room? There was a very small armoire that was almost useless. Again, I will give props to the guy at the front desk though. I wish I knew his name - he was really great. And while the hotel is nothing better than awful, in the grand scheme of things the location was okay. ****AND SADLY my daughter left her iPod in the room and now they are saying they don't have it. Clearly their housekeeping staff must have found it because they were the next people to enter the room so where is it now? Unacceptable. For the record it is possible to stay in a small, no frills hotel in NYC. We used one from another major chain (Marr**tt) a couple of moths ago & while it was tiny, it was lovely. If you must stay at this hotel please know that inbound not put more than 2 people in a room.

One can be in Time Square, Broadway shows, Michelin Star restaurants, the subway station, Lincoln center all in about 10-15 mins of walk. During my last visit to NYC, in order to save some money, I stayed in a hotel in Queens. Having stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Midtown location this time, I can now see what a poor decision that was. The most precious commodity that one has in a city like NYC is time. It is well worth paying a little extra and staying in a central location in Manhattan like this. We found the area around the hotel safe and even while walking back at 1:00 am we did not feel uncomfortable or unsafe. The hotel staff was courteous and attentive to our needs. The complimentary breakfast buffet options were better than the staid free breakfast one finds in most hotels. Yes, the dining area did get crowded in the morning. But this is NYC and some of that is to be expected. The breakfast staff was attentive in helping us and keeping the victuals refilled. We did find two drawbacks to this hotel. The elevators had a long wait time. The hotel caters to large groups and with so many people arriving or leaving at the same time, the lobby can get crowded and the elevator wait times can be a little long. Also the rooms are small. Because of this sound travels more easily from other rooms, hallways, and the streets. But these small issues did not bother us much. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel because of the central location, the breakfast buffet, and the attentive staff, and reasonable rates.

I don't suggest falling asleep outside, just saying my friend and I were so tired when we got there that we couldn't help it.It's not super close to anything major, but it's within reasonable walking distance of Times Square so long as you don't have any physical problems preventing you from walking comfortably. Transit isn't too far, but I admit that I found it unnecessary and walked an average of 9 hours a day, once going from the hotel to Chelsea/ The High Line and back up to Central park before walking back down to the Comedy Cellar in the Chelsea area. That was a long day and definitely not for everyone. Still, it was nice to have a hotel situated between the major attractions without being close to the crowds and constant noise.Really close to the hotel on 46th and 9th are several nightlife options, including a piano bar where the staff take requests for everything from Broadway songs to Queen, an Italian restaurant, and a sushi place. All along 10th just up from the hotel are lots of deli options and places to eat or get a drink as well.Getting there from the airport (Newark) was distressing even via taxi and it was expensive. However, the ride to LaGuardia wasn't bad. Just hailed a taxi right out front. For anyone flying from LaGuardia, do note I didn't see a duty free store. If you want to bring anything like alcohol back, buy it before you get to the airport. We flew to Toronto for a connector flight and they advised me I couldn't use the duty free store despite having flown in from the United States. Quite the irritation.","Vancouver, Canada","Anniexus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",48,4.0

The hotel is situated close to the Hudson River with the Intrepid museum just a couple of blocks away. Train stations are just a few blocks along and this hotel is also good for persons wishing to walk parts of the city. Recommend the highline walk which takes you down to the Chelsea district. Staff here were all very good and special thanks for Ashley Rolan on reception for giving us a voucher for money off the Intrepid museum entrance fee. The room was fairly small but this is New York and time should be spent outside enjoying this fabulous city. We had the front facing room on the sixth floor and being a light sleeper I did have problems with people coming out of local clubs at +3 in the morning. Spoke to other guests who heard nothing at the rear of the hotel so may be worth requesting a back facing room. Hotel although very busy served free breakfast which was more than adequate for me. In summary try to secure a room in the back and enjoy the hotels location and incredible staff. Tip for visitors who haven't used the metro...Buy a card 1$ and add say 20$ this will give rides costing about 2.50$ per journey regardless of length. One card can be used for two people or more and obviously each person who swipes will be charged the 2.50$.,"Margate, United Kingdom","Glyn P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Margate, United Kingdom</strong>",45,4.0

The other slight con is location. It's about 10 minutes' walk west of 8th avenue. This doesn't sound like a long ways, but when you are coming and going a lot, it can seem like a ways... I did find that the M50 bus runs on 50th street just a couple of blocks north. This allowed me to save some of my walking for exploring other areas of the city.

Josie greeted us upon our arrival at about 8am Sunday morning (we had an early flight and arrived at the hotel well before check-in time) and graciously accepted our bags for safe keeping. She then went out of her way to give us maps, subway and other mass transit tips (critically important for 2 people from upstate NY) and other vital information that helped us to have a successful day on Sunday, traveling as we did to the Brooklyn Bridge, then to Yankee Stadium and back to the hotel.

Waiting for it to arrive and take you to your floor is agonizing. The lower the floor you are on, the better.

Not a day has gone by, so far, where I have not seen charter style busses up front, loading/unloading people. This, I believe, is primarily due to the location (less than 2 blocks from a cruise ship terminal), and few blocks the opposite direction from Times Square. That level of business, more often than not, leaves the lobby very crowded. If you were, perhaps, staying here for only a night (waiting to go on a cruise) - or getting back from a cruise, and staying a day before you fly ""home,"" this might be an okay place to stay, simply because of the proximity to the cruise terminal.The elevators (two of them) are atrociously slow. In my four nights, I have waited up to 10 minutes for an elevator to reach me, simply because the hotel is so busy, the elevators are so slow, that often, they work their way up (floor by floor) and empty out, and then start on their way down, filling up, floor by floor. There have been several times where an elevator does come after about 3-4 minutes and it's full, so you have to wait for the next one - or even a second or third one, after that. Morning and evenings are particularly bad about this - and it's really frustrating to be ready to leave the hotel, and have to wait so long for an elevator. (I've also seen the buttons already pushed by the time I reached the elevator, but whomever had pushed it had clearly given up as they were no longer there - and I've still had to wait 3,5,7 minutes for the elevator to show up.) Admittedly, I understand that the hotel has limited control over something like this - as the only real solution would be to replace the elevators with faster ones - and perhaps better logic behind how it carries people. This is, no doubt, would be an expensive endeavor - but in all honesty, given the volume of people this hotel puts through, I think it would go a long way towards making a stay more pleasant.Breakfast - HA! While the selection is quite good (as it is with most HI Express locations,) be prepared to wait a significant amount of time to get anything. So, if you want breakfast before you leave the hotel, for example, plan 10 minutes to wait for the elevator and another 20 or so to actually get your breakfast because of the lines. The staff does a decent enough job in keeping up with supply/demand - but it's honestly not worth it to me (despite being free) after I'm already frustrated by the elevator wait.The staff seem pretty hit/miss. I've interacted with a few that have a good sense of humor and are friendly - and others who, when you ask questions, seem bothered by having to answer and/or have a ""I'm right, you're wrong"" kind of attitude. The fact that they don't allow delivery people up to the rooms (to deliver a pizza for example) -- and force you to wait for the elevator to come down and get it, is also a nuisance. I understand there are some safety concerns - but come on - this is the hospitality industry. I'm staying in a HOTEL (that I'm paying for) -- and paying someone to delivery food to me. Why should you (the hotel) interfere with my paying for convenience? For that matter, anyone can technically walk on to an elevator and go anywhere anyway; so why stop delivery people and force them to give you the information of the customer, so you can call and ask them (me) to come down and get my food? If you want to call and verify that I have a delivery before sending them up, fine - I've had other hotels do this and it's perfectly reasonable. If you want to frisk them before they come up - that's between you and the delivery person, but don't interfere with my time by forcing me to do something (come down and get food) - when I've paid for the convenience of having it delivered. Housekeeping is also hit or miss. The A/C filters in my room were absolutely filthy upon arrival. Who knows when they were last cleaned. There were crumbs of ""stuff"" in random room corners, and in general the room just seemed to have a lack of care. This lack of care further showed when I found a Q-tip (I had thrown it in the bathroom trash) in the toilet. As it was the only thing in the trash, did housekeeping just dump the Q-tip in the toilet (maybe or maybe not attempt to flush it down) and put the trash receptacle down so as to not have to change the liner? Also, after having my room serviced, I found an old pizza box still in my room, rather than having been discarded. Did they think I'd want to eat old/cold/unrefrigerated pizza 24 hours after having it delivered?The room itself is small; I guess you could actually say it's about average for NYC - whatever. The bathroom is TINY - difficult to maneuver in there - and you can't close the bathroom door with the floor mat down, because the door catches on it. It's also worth noting that when I got to my room, the refrigerator was unplugged - not turned off - UNPLUGGED. In order to turn it on, I had to move it out of the cabinet it is in, and plug it in. While I'm all about energy savings, this is the hospitality industry - I shouldn't have to a) figure out what's wrong and b) when I do, move appliances to resolve the issue. Other hotels have posted signs by their refrigerators saying something along the lines of ""In efforts to be green, the refrigerator has been turned off. If you wish to use it, please turn the knob inside towards X."" I'm okay with an approach like this - at least I know what's going on - and in this case, if I want to use it, I know what action to take. If, for some reason, the hotel is NOT responsible for the unplugging of the refrigerator, it then goes back to my lack of care by housekeeping - because it would make me wonder why they didn't identify the issue and resolve it.Needless to say, I'm not impressed by this location. There are other things I could say, but at over 6000 characters, I should just wrap it up. If this hotel were anywhere by NYC, I would value it at about $70/night. In NYC, $100/night. My rate, however, has been anywhere from low 100's to low 200's, depending on the night. I understand that rates fluctuate for a variety of factors, but given the amenities (or lack thereof), the age, quality, etc., it is generally not worthy what you are going to pay, unless you have very specific reason/purpose to book here (i.e. - to be extremely close to the cruise terminal.)One could definitely find far worse places to stay - (the bed, at least, is comfortable - and the A/C works well, which is more a problem in hotels than one might expect) - but I'd likely not stay at this location ever again (even if I was cruising out of the nearby terminal.)","Newark, Delaware","Ryan B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newark, Delaware</strong>",19,3.0

With the exception of our experiences with Housekeeping and one woman at the breakfast room, the Front Desk staff, bell staff and breakfast room staff were all friendly and efficient. The hotel is also very well located for those who don't mind a short walk to the main tourist drags. The Hell's Kitchen neighbourhood where this hotel is located has lots of great food options (try B Squared for great pizza/pasta and Anejo for awesome Mexican nearby). The air-conditioning was excellent! We visited during a heatwave and the room's A/C unit was used a lot and performed excellently.Now for the opportunities for improvement:1. The Wi-fi is hit and miss. It would connect and then drop repeatedly. Sometimes the wifi just wouldn't let you log-on. I was travelling with three others and we all experienced the same troubles. None of us were doing any streaming or downloading of large files we were checking Social Media or sending e-mails. This was ongoing throughout our entire stay and a real annoyance.2. The room itself is nicely decorated and makes the most of a small space but visitors should expect that its downtown New York so space is at a premium. The linens and terry in the room however are subpar. Their Housekeeping need should be looking at what the room attendants are putting in the room. Our towels were ripped and torn as was the sheet on the bed. Furthermore, the sheet was ripped throughout our entire stay. I don't expect a sheet to be changed daily as I don't change my home sheets daily, and I don't fault a Room Attendant for missing it the first time he/she made the bed but for the Room Attendant not to see the hole in our sheet at any point when making our bed during our stay and taking the time to change it seems absurd. The shower curtain also had a rip/hole in it and was never changed throughout our stay and the grout lines in the shower were brown/red in some areas making me wonder as to their cleanliness.3. The Room Attendant didn't seem to take much time or attention with our room. On a couple of occasions both garbage cans were not emptied, only one. An ice bucket sat for two days with melted ice in it and the Housekeeping did not empty it and place it back. Further on an elevator ride with two ""supervisors"" according to their name-tags they were much more interested in their own conversation than greeting us or wishing us well/hold the elevator doors as we left.4. The breakfast room is a bit crazy. Granted its free, so you need to go in with low expectations but the general layout of the space isn't ideal. It causes some bottlenecks and each time we went (at varying times in the morning both early and later) it was crammed. The food variety is quite good but one morning there was a woman there in a suit and a name tag (I think her initials may have been S.M.) and she was trying to organise things but seemed overwhelmed. At one point as she passed me she mumbled under her breath ""Oh jesus christ"" in reaction to the actions of others at the food bar which I found surprising. Now I am not a religious person but I thought someone in her position (I thought I read on her name tag that she was the Asst. GM but I could be wrong) should not be showing signs of such frustration in front of hotel guests. Comments such as those are probably best kept behind the scenes. Sonia the Housekeeping Manager on the other hand was there the following morning and was a great assistance to the flow and the guests trying to get breakfast and she managed it all with a smile... so kudos to her.Ultimately this hotel was a real mixed bag. Some things were great, while others were very disappointing. I for one take exception to a hotel that charges Manhattan prices but doesn't think enough of its guests to provide them with towels that are in decent condition. Further it didn't seem like the Room Attendants really did much in the room aside form make the bed. Not taking the time to change a torn bed sheet is unacceptable. I'd probably try elsewhere next time I visited as the good doesn't make up for what I found fell short.","Vancouver, Canada","AquariusShark</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",12,2.0

My husband and I booked this hotel for two main reasons. One, because it was close to the cruise ship port and two, because it offers a FREE breakfast. Let me tell you, it was a great choice. The staff, particularly Josie, John and Susana whom we dealt with most during our stay were all very friendly, polite and extremely helpful. The second day of our stay, I mentioned to Josie we were on our honeymoon and she became so excited and immediately began searching for a room on the upper floors. We hadn't unpacked yet so she told us to leave our things and they would have a better room for us when we got back from site seeing. True to her word, we went from the 2nd floor right up to the top floor with a beautiful view of the water and the city. Our mornings were made extra special by the sweetheart, John. He is the star who keeps everything stocked, cleaned and running smoothly during breakfast. Which by the way, has a vast selection of so many delicious foods (especially the cinnamon buns!!). The very first day, I asked John for 2 packages of strawberry jam because I couldn't find any. From that day on, he went out of his way to get me 2 packages every morning so I would have it with my bagel. He truly goes out of his way to make your morning special. We had a great night sleep each night on a comfortable bed with nice soft pillows. We never wanted for anything because our room was always tended to after we left.

It is a small hotel with small but tidy and clean rooms and serves a simple continental and cooked buffet breakfast.

It biggest assets are it's helpful and friendly staff and convenient location that is within 10 minutes walk of Times Square. It is a little bit of a backwater but in a smarter location would probably be more expensive. My tips:- To catch a yellow cab it's best to walk a few hundred yards to either 10th or 11th Avenue as few pass through 48th West. - Breakfast at peak times can be very busy in the smallish breakfast room so either get to it early or be prepared to find a table or weather permitting take your breakfast out onto the terrace with comfy seating to the front of the hotel. - WiFi is free and fresh brewed coffee in flasks is free all day and evening to residents in the breakfast / lounge area opposite reception.

There isn't much on this part of 48th, which I thought would be a plus as it might be quiet at night - wrong. Deliveries were being made across the street all night with lots of banging noise. You will have to walk to the next block to find small restaurants or stores, 2 blocks will give you better selections. They have outdoor seating, but it would be nice if they would replace the dirty looking seating and add more plants to freshen it up.Lobby and Reception: Very small lobby - seating for about 3! The breakfast food is beside the lobby and can be used as additional seating after breakfast. 2 computers are available with a printer. Free wifi in the rooms. Check in was fast, nice, helpful staff. Rooms: Very small, but well furnished, and clean. Pillows were lumpy and should be replaced. Bar fridge kept me up all night as it would start up every 15 minutes and was very loud. I asked for it to be disconnected so I actually slept the 2nd night. Safe in room, but you have to kneel on the floor to get at it.

The night cleaning staff were very noisy in the basement, banging buckets while the filled them, talking very loudly. One person was able to move upstairs, but the others were stuck there, they weren't happy (same price as rooms on upper floors).Breakfast: A good breakfast was included in the price, typical choice: yogurt, toast, bacon, scrambled eggs, omelettes, cereal, apples, bananas, etc. Not quite enough seating, so give yourself enough time in the morning.It is an ok hotel, but given that there are better hotels at a similar price point, closer to Timesquare and the subway, I would stay elsewhere next time.",montreal,"purpleirises1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>montreal</strong>",42,3.0

That said, I enjoyed my time here. The neighborhood is actually a lot more fun than I realized before I got there. It's got great restaurants and is diverse, beautiful, and convenient to the rest of Manhattan. The room was clean, though not luxurious, the free hot breakfast was plentiful and tasty, the free round-the-clock coffee was a nice perk, and the staff was friendly. I also like that I was allowed to check in over two hours before the official checkin time and that it wasn't TOO hard to get a late checkout (although I wish the staff had been a bit more accommodating when it came to the latter).My only complaint is that I was given a really pathetic room in the basement, which had no view, obviously, and was directly across the hall from a staff supply room and next door to the staff laundry. The hotel wasn't full, so they didn't need to put me there. The sense I got is that they stuck me down there because a.) I had a discount rate and b.) they could tell I wouldn't put up a fuss. The walls, I guess, are orety thin, because it was noisy morning, noon and night, with staff banging around, and I felt like they could probably hear everything I was doing, too. Also, the refrigerator in my room didn't work, nor did the air conditioning or the remote control for the television. I was exhausted during my trip (had just been discharged from hospital) and didn't have the energy to deal with multiple room repairs or having to move,so I only notified staff about the air conditioning and the remote.

First I have stayed all over NYC in various properties. This property is really not all that bad, but it has bad things about it. I found the service impeccable and the staff very friendly. However the location for a Hell Kitchen hotel is not great at all. If you are leaving on a cruise, then you would want to stay here, as the cruise ships are literally less than two blocks from the hotel. If you want to buy a Lexus, just exit left out of the lobby and less than 100 yards you can buy a new car! There is little to nothing around the hotel as far a restaurants. Yes of course you can walk to 10th and find things, but next to the hotel there is nothing. The Salvation Army location is directly across the street. If you are here for Time Square and the other sites, there are better locations and properties. If you stay here, you will get your exercise as it is really out of the way. There are two hotel elevators that are not at all sufficient. If you can, request a lower room and use the steps, or if you prefer to wait 10 minutes for an elevator that is up to you. You will make many new friends on the elevator Breakfast is included with the price of the hotel, and it quite simply it is the largest breakfast circus I have EVER seen. The food is not in the appropriate area causing traffic jams. I don't know if they planned the breakfast area and this is the best they could offer but it is terrible! The food is typical. Forget about sitting, there is simply not enough seating. You may want to head outside and eat if not too cold. Expect large groups of people from tour buses. This could be causing the traffic jams for breakfast. They will tell you to come early, but listen I have stayed in other HIE's in New York and never saw anything like this.The hotel has Dish Network so you get a boat load of HD channels. The rooms are tiny, but I have seen smaller. The room I was in girls.....had a bathtub. It really has everything that you would need. Bottom-line not a bad property, but you can do better staying elsewhere. If the price is right go for it. You may want to try the 3 star row hotels on 39th and 8th, way better location and about 6 hotels in a row that are 3 stars similar type hotels to the HIE's. It is by the Port Authority Transportation center and in the middle of everything.","Pittsburgh, PA","USABRAVO</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pittsburgh, PA</strong>",50,3.0

The breakfast was not good, and the morning crowd made it even worse to try to navigate towards the breakfast line. My mother, asked one of the staff members for salsa, and he did not understand what she meant. He kept saying either ""ketchup"" or ""hot sauce"" and prompted to give my mother ""McDonald's"" ketchup packets out of his apron!!!! How disrespectful! Apparently, this hotel does not have a service elevator for it's housekeeping staff, and me and my mother got squished in the elevate with three housekeeping staff and huge bags of their laundry. The laundry bags fell on us and they didn't even apologize! I went downstairs to get delivery brochures and the gentlemen at the front desk did not make eye contact with me and kept typing on the computer, talk about horrible customer service. On top of that, other staff (I presume housekeeping) were all talking to another front desk agent and ignored me as well.

Not up to par of what we usually expect with HI Express. The reception was lack luster when we first entered the lobby. They looked at us like they thought we may be lost. They were nicer afterwards when we had contact with them but the first impression was poor and the lobby was empty, it is not like they were busy. This is a busy hotel with lots of tour buses with school trips and lots of tourists hanging out in the breakfast area. The breakfast was adequate but it is like a scene from the Hunger Games. Everyone has to line up and hope to get a turn. The elevators can barely keep up with the demand. We walked down every time we left and a few times just took the stairs to our room. The room was fine with adequate space. We never had anyone come in to clean up but I did ask a cleaning lady one day if she could just change the garbage bags and give us clean towels but she seemed to be having a bad day and came across as quite angry so I just did it all myself. I did not want her in our room. I saw her again the next day and she seemed a little nicer. The location is fine, Hell's Kitchen is a great place to find great restaurants. The biggest problem with this hotel was that the internet never worked for us. I think so many guests logged on int he evening, the internet could not handle it. The hotel promises 2 things: Free Internet and free breakfast: Internet was not delivered upon and getting to breakfast was not pleasant.

I travel frequently for work, and have stayed in quite a few Holiday Inn Express properties. I usually have a pretty good experience with them, so we chose to stay at this HIE. In preparation for our trip to NYC, I read some of the dos and don'ts about travel in NYC. One of the things I read was that the staff at the hotels were not usually very accommodating toward their guests. This turned out to be a complete untruth when dealing with the staff at the HIE of Manhattan Midtown West. Our flight was delayed, and we were late to check in. The young man who handled our check-in on Monday evening was very professional and happy to help. We did not immediately want to go to bed, so he told us how to get to Times Square for a walk and asked us how things went when we returned. The following morning we asked for directions to the World Trade Center Memorial, and another young man was more than happy to give us the information requested. He made certain that we understood where to go and that we were sure what we needed to do, as the subway system can be a bit intimidating. However, the young lady who worked the last two mornings of our visit was the star of the show for us. Her name was Josie. We had several stops to make, and she wrote the whole trip's directions down for us and gave us tips on what to do when we arrived at each stop. Josie gave us all of the tips and directions in her wonderfully authentic New York accent. The hotel was very busy the entire time we were there with at least four large groups, but that did not phase the staff. The rooms are a bit small, but it is Manhattan.

Breakfast was good, but the breakfast room is quite small, so make sure you leave plenty of time. One other small downside is the fact that there is only two lifts, meaning accessing the top floors can take quite a while. Would definitely stay here again.

I contacted the front desk who sent security up, silence!I spoke with the desk that morning who informed me they had sent the students packing, way to go!!.Through the disturbance I was informed we could have a late check-out, even without asking.Michael and his team go out of there way to make sure your stay is enjoyable and nothing is a problem. In the mornings they serve up a great breakfast, a little busy if you hit it at the wrong time (best going just after 9). The room we had was more than suitable with a king size bed, a small but manageable bathroom which had a fantastic shower and the room was cleaned daily. The hotel is situated roughly 15 minutes walk from times square with plenty of deli's and places to eat nearby.

It is an American breakfast with bagles, pastry, toast, eggs, sausages. There is coffee, tea, a fridge with a good variety of yoghurts. Unfortunately, there is only plastic cutlery and dishes. Overall, this breakfast is okay. The quality is okay and it will provide you a start for the day, but it is not fancy.I would like to mention the nice breakfast lady who was very friendly. She organized for me more strawberry yoghurt after my favorite brand was already taken. Her colleague took frequently care of the coffee. Both were very attentive. When we checked out, we were asked how satisfied we were with our stay. Very. Again, very friendly staff.Location: The location is a bit off the beaten track, around 15 minutes to walk to the Times Square. Next subway stop is 3 blocks away.

I arrived at the hotel early and they were kind enough to check me in early. They did ask whether I would be fine with a ground floor room. I did say yes. It was really kind of them to let me in early after a 10 hour flight from South America. I was really grateful.DO NOT DO THIS- get a room on a higher floor. My room was located next to the gym, by a staff room and opposite the breakfast room which was open 24/7 with music as you could get free coffee. It was also right by the stairwell which lots of guests used and let the door slam. I am a very heavy sleeper and barely got any sleep here as it was such a noisy room. It has put me off ever coming back. The rooms on the upper floors may be a lot better.The rooms are what you'd expect, clean, got all you need, no frills, but not that basic either. You got lots of towels, toiletries and a comfy bed. The rooms were fairly dated in their appearance but more than fine to stay in and represented what you paid. There is a sign up saying if you forgot any of the basics like toothbrushes you can tell reception and they'll give you one for free. Really kind and useful service. I picked up a sewing kit for a loose button.The location of the hotel was good- three blocks to time square - a short walk to get in the thick of things. It was well lit at night to walk back to, and did not feel a dangerous area at all. One of the great things about the hotel was the free breakfast. Expect to queue for 15 minutes to get a table (whatever time of the morning you try) it really is an asset to the hotel, but also frustrating when you just want to go out and explore.I have to say the staff were excellent here, made you feel really welcome and were very kind people The hotel can order you a private car to the airport which is really handy as taxis don't really go past the hotel, I did this as I had so much luggage. This wasn't the hotels fault, but the car was over half an hour late with not even an apology and I had to help put my suitcases in the boot as they couldn't lift them. If you use them- make sure there is plenty of time spare and keep chasing the staff on reception to make sure the car comes. With so many hotels in NYC I'd be loathed to stay here again as I barely got any sleep, the noise was relentless and it didn't leave for a relaxing holiday at all. The staff were good though, and that's why I gave it three stars, otherwise it would have been two.","Chichester, United Kingdom","janeyglue</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chichester, United Kingdom</strong>",4,3.0

I am a naturally light sleeper so sleep with ear plugs in and I didn't hear anything (including the sirens and traffic noise outside!) to stop me having a good nights sleep! The amazingly comfortable king size beds also greatly assisted in this too!The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from Times Square and the location is ideal for anyone who wishes to be close enough to the hustle and bustle of the main streets but far enough away for some relaxation when required. Be warned though you will walk miles whilst on holiday in NYC!Will remember every second of my holiday to New York (especially getting engaged!) and will definitely consider staying at the HIE Manhattan West Side for a return trip.

Sure, the holiday inn express doesn't have a cavernous marble-festooned lobby, nor is it a 30 second walk to 5th ave.

With two large double beds and a large (for NY)bathroom it was more than enough space for me and my Mum. Yes the neighbourhood isn't 'fancy' and maybe it's because we aren't particularly 'fancy' folks this didn't bother us at all-I very much warmed to Hells Kitchen/Clinton area and felt more of a neighbourhood than the more touristy spots. The breakfast in the hotel is more than adequate with a variety of food from cereal and bread to hot food. It does get very busy and seating is limited, but for complimentary breakfast I can't really justify that as a 'complaint'The highlight for me was the staff, from check-in to breakfast every day, to the staff member who stopped me on our final day to say 'goodbye' everyone was really marvellous.

Salvation Army is directly across street so there is always a crowd on the street. It was there day and night and did make my 5th floor room a bit noisy. It is NYC, so I expect noise. This was people talking noise, spiced with the occasional disagreement. Almost next store was a M4M strip club. I never felt unsafe, but, day or night, I never felt completely relaxed either. Mix of stores and small restaurants on 10th. 11th was mostly car dealers and repair. Horses and horse drawn carriages overnight other side of 11th. Room was utilitarian and on the small side. Clean. Hotel offers breakfast. Never ate due to large crowds. Hotel was very full and appeared many were value driven travelers. Staff was great. Very pleasant. Seems like staffing is at near minimum viable level. Frequently there was a line waiting. Cabs are present on street, but plan for some delay. No line like at larger hotels.

The first stay was in room that was supposed to have a queen bed. If that was a queen bed then it was put into the room sideways which is the only way it would have fit in the room. The result was that the room was, effectively, very small. Given that, it was still a comfortable enough; however, it should be noted that the room did not have a microwave nor did it have a refrigerator ... something we've sort of become accustomed to. The room DID have a very nice shower; however, there was very little (as in ""almost none"") counter space in the bathroom. Our second stay was in a room with a king bed and THAT room had actually been designed with the king bed in mind. ;-) That room was very comfortable, even though it,room, too, didn't have a microwave and the bath also didn't have much counter space.

However, if you are looking for a place to stay that will give you good access to the theater district and, for that matter, the rest of New York City, then I can heartily recommend this hotel. The staff is extremely nice, helpful, and friendly. Being located at 538 W 48th, it is within easy walking distance of a subway stop (at W 50th and 8th Ave) that will take you directly to the World Trade Center and it is also within easy walking distance of several theaters (e.g. the Walter Kerr Theatre at 219 W 48th). Taxi fare to other Broadway theaters should be about $8.00 (total, including tip). A ""Breakfast Buffet"" is included and this one is very good. (They had an automatic pancake maker that produced 2 4"" pancakes when you pushed a button. ;-)",Boerne,"RDW2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boerne</strong>",24,4.0

However, the rooms are a little cramped and could do with some sort of soundproofing, as I could hear every car and person outside the building, in the room next door, in the hallway, and literally anywhere else in the world. Between that and the fact that the sheets are extremely thin, it's hard to get a good night's sleep, especially if you're here on a weekend visit. Keep in mind that this wasn't on the first floor; this was on the top (11th) floor. I heard people outside like they were outside my window on the 11th floor.The shower was also weird--for one thing, we had a housekeeper replenish our toiletries with three lotions instead of a lotion, shampoo, and conditioner, but also, it was extremely difficult to figure out how to use the shower. (Hint: You pull down on the bathtub's faucet.) The towel rack is awkwardly placed in a way that makes you feel like you will soak all of the towels once you turn on the shower, as it is in the same stall as your shower and is about six feet away from the shower head.Most importantly to anybody who plans on using the internet, though: ""Spotty"" is an extremely nice way to describe the internet. In the twenty minutes that I have used writing this review from the hotel room, I have had the internet drop out a grand total of five times--in fact, I have had to adjust that number twice while writing this review!--and it's bad no matter what time of day you're using it. Midnight? Nope. Six in the morning? Nope. When it does work, it's slow and hard to do anything more than check your e-mail. If you have mobile data on your phone, you'll most likely get a wonderful 4G signal in your room, so it'll be easier to waste your data.However, the location is (for the most part) very well-kept and the continental breakfast was tolerable. It's a very convenient place to stay in Manhattan. You get a pretty good selection of DirecTV channels in your room--I believe you only lose pay-per-view and on-demand channels?--and the air conditioning works fine and doesn't suck the humidity from the air in the process. It's a clean, smoke-free environment.If you're looking for a place to stay for cheap, this is your place. However, I passed quite a few other hotels while walking to Rockefeller Plaza and I'm sure that those would suit you better if you're looking for more than just an air-conditioned/heated room to put your stuff down in and sleep in.","Rochester, New York","Matt L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rochester, New York</strong>",2,3.0

Every little extra thing we needed was gladly available to us (printing tickets in the lobby for free; holding our luggage for the day; having them phone a local pizza place for us) and the usual processes such as check-in, check-out, and room cleaning were handled professionally and efficiently. It is clear that the staff are happy and well trained. The hotel was about 10-15 minutes from Times Square and the savings were worth it. Not only that, but the free breakfast saved our family of 4 a lot over the course of 3 days we were there. My husband is quite a picky eater, but even he was pleased with the selection and quality (breads, cereals, scrambled eggs, bacon, oatmeal, fruit, juice/milk/coffee/tea. Yes, it could be a very chaotic place in the morning, but just keep looking out for a table as you're getting your food and you'll find a spot. They have a wonderful outdoor area you could go to as well. One thing that very much impressed me is that they were still bringing out full trays of bacon and eggs with only 10 minutes to go for breakfast. As for the hotel rooms, they are small, but that is par for NYC. I found it wasn't as sound-proofed as some other hotels, but that was a minor complaint. We were usually so exhausted from our sightseeing around the city that we slept very soundly. The beds were very comfortable. We enjoyed having a mini-fridge and were glad we brought a cooler of drinks with us....snacks and drinks in the city can be expensive. Think about everything you want to do in the city. If you're only doing Times Square/Broadway, stay there for convenience and to save time. But if doing a wide variety of attractions, stay here and save some money - you can still get to everything quite conveniently. The cabs are very reasonable in NYC so use them for any attractions that are a distance away. Another bonus to this hotel was how easy and quick it was to get to by driving - it was only about a 2 or 3 minute drive from the Lincoln Tunnel, so it was easy to get to and when you're nervous about driving in NYC, it's good to not have to go far.

Every morning I had to throw elbows for food, most of it was gone, I'd normally settle for a stale bagel. They need more staff to run breakfast if they are selling this as a feature. We also had to ask twice to get our room cleaned the first day then the day we were checking out (11am checkout) she came before 9am to clean the room..really? You're going to clean it twice? The rooms were clean and small, the doors are paper thin and there is only two tiny elevators for 11 floors which the staff use as well. It takes forever to get up and down.

However, there is nothing that the hotel can do as people hog tables and work on their computers. You would think they would realize a ton of people are trying to eat breakfast. There is enough selection for breakfast for everyone. Hotel is in great proximity to everything including Times Square. I did have one issue which was corrected by the Housekeeping Manager within minutes. I told the Hotel Manager Yan that I need my linens changed and the message made it to the Housekeeping Manager and no further. They did however address changing the linens within 15 minutes without issue. Provided a nice note and some complimentary chocolates which was really nice. I was quite impressed how they handled the problem. Oh and I forgot to mention the gentleman who handles the breakfast was very sweet soft spoken and nice. They have a good staff at this hotel. We will definitely return. One thing I do have to note is the slowness of the elevator slows down everything in the lobby.

Perhaps a bit too long to walk every day if you were elderly, but convenient for the group I was travelling with. The room was basic - we had a double bed and a sofa bed. The sofa bed was relatively uncomfy, but I was so tired from the jetlag and being out all day that I slept anyways.

Most of the employees were very pleasant and welcoming but the Guest Services Manager, Michael Guillen was incredibly unsympathetic and unhelpful. Not only was he unaware and uninformed about his own hotel's policies, he also made almost zero effort to help us in this situation. He was unable to show us where it stated in our reservation the hotel's policy of same-day cancellations. He made 1-2 calls to other hotels to check their availability, and only did so after blaming us for this situation that we had no say in. After nearly three hours in the hotel lobby, we were finally able to find an adequate lodging situation, but only after missing our dinner reservations that we had made 3 weeks prior.

Unfortunately I had to fly out to LA and Australia the following day but if I'd realised how excellently positioned this place was I would have booked at least one night more.As a single traveller on a budget I chose the least expensive option and it was more than adequate for my needs. The room, although being quite small, had everything I required with a very comfy queen bed with an en suite bathroom which included a full bath. With a very substantial breakfast included in the cost of the room and served in a communal dining room - make sure you get in early to snag a seat! - means you start the day with your stomach full of nutrious food. There's even a very nifty automatic pancake maker which only takes a couple of minutes to spit out two perfectly cooked little treats.My room had an automatic coffee maker - a nice way to end a busy day trawling the streets of this exciting city - and everything I needed to make my stay very enjoyable.This was an excellent hotel to base myself, being within very close walking distance of Times Square and the Broadway District. I was pleasantly surprised when I went for a wander around the nearby neighbourhood looking for a place to catch a quick bite to eat and pick up a few supplies. Located in the suburb of Hell's Kitchen - not quite a moniker you expect to be able to walk around quite safely on your own with a twisted ankle at dusk but I felt very safe and marvelled at the recently renovated apartment buildings lining the nearby streets. There was no graffiti to be seen whatsoever and chatting with a couple of the residents was a delightful interlude along the way. My favourite surprise was happening upon a gorgeous little community garden right in the centre of this bustling metropolis and only a block from the hotel along W. 48th St. It was the size of a pocket handkerchief and nestled between two apartment blocks. The brilliant display of daffodils, tulips and other colourful varieties along with pretty bushes and a few garden seats nestled in amongst the foliage meant it was a delightful place to sit and reflect for a while.With the hotel located in such a flat district, it's easy to get around even for someone with a sore ankle and I enjoyed being in the centre of this bustling place.The staff were extremely helpful and friendly - and when the gentlemen on the front desk - regretfully I can't remember his name but a lovely African American with an unusual name and the biggest smile - found out I had twisted my ankle earlier in the day he was quick to provide me with a bag full of ice, towels to wrap around it and extra pillows for elevation purposes. I was so very grateful for his help and those ministrations certainly made a difference to the swelling and pain. I would definitely stay in this hotel again if ever I happen to have the chance to fly from my home-town in Brisbane, Australia across the world to New York City.","Yackandandah, Australia","JenniferLarmarAuthor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yackandandah, Australia</strong>",47,5.0

This was my first trip to NYC and as a detailed-oriented person, spent a significant amount of time researching accommodations in Manhattan before my trip. Of course, there are a plethora of options, from hostels; to renting an apartment; to the hotels and more. I spent time searching on sites like VRBO, and found many of the less expensive options booked for my days. Ditto with the apartment rentals. And looking at hotels, found many to be quite expensive compared to what I'm used to here in small town Ontario, Canada. If you are looking for comfortable, affordable (for NYC-NOT wherever you are from) accommodation, then please consider the Holiday Inn Express on W. 48th St in Manhattan. I booked it from one of the hotel booking sites as one of the ""secret"" deals where the hotel name and location is revealed after booking, and saved about 30%. This Holiday Inn Express features a full hot breakfast daily. There was ample quantities of food, bacon, scrambled eggs, cinnamon rolls, juice, coffee/tea, toast, waffles, fruit, you name it. The room I was given had a king sized bed; workstation, and there was complimentary wireless internet. I had a private bathroom featuring tasteful tile and a glass walk-in shower. I did also go on Trip Advisor after booking this hotel and read some complaints. The main three were that the rooms were small; the rooms were expensive; and that it was a long way from Times Square. Well, let me set the record straight: first, it's NYC! Real Estate is a valuable commodity, and so rooms in most hotels are small in NYC. Deal with it. This isn't Boise, Idaho! Unless you are willing to spend a thousand dollars a night, you aren't going to get a spacious hotel room in Manhattan. Secondly, again, it's NYC! The rooms are going to be expensive. And this, for most of you, is going to be an experience of a lifetime, to visit Manhattan. Are you really going to quibble over a couple hundred bucks? If so, NYC is likely not for you. This isn't Dothan, Alabama, ok? There is a reason why millions of people want to visit NYC and most of you reading this have never heard of Dothan, AL (my apologies to those readers from there, but if it's any consolation, I've been to Dothan, nice place). Sure, you could stay in Hoboken or Hackensack and hike it in on the MTA trains every day, and waste hours of valuable vacation time sitting on the subway, but do you really want to do that to save a $100 a night? Or, you could stay in Harlem or Queens or Brooklyn and face the same kind of commute. But you are there to stay in Manhattan, right?! So spend the $$. Look for deals. Skip lunch. Buy one less souvenir. But you can't put a price on a private bath and a safe place to store your stuff while you are out seeing the sights. Lastly, about the distance to Times Square: it's about a 15 minute walk, yes. A little father than some with mobility issues might like. But have you priced out hotels on the doorstep of Times Square? Um. Yeah. I'm not a walker by any means, in my normal life here in Ontario, Canada. But at the same time, I didn't go to NYC just to see Times Square. I was all over that little island, Uptown and Downtown, East and West. It doesn't really matter where you stay. There is ample public transit if you don't want to walk. You can take a cab to Times Square for about $10-15 if you like. I walked most everywhere close by and am no worse for wear because of it. In fact, I've started walking regularly now since being home. This hotel is on the doorstep of Hell's Kitchen. I ate in many fine restaurants there. It's a 10 minute walk to a subway that will take you anywhere in Metro NYC that you wanna go. It's 5-10 minutes walk from the Western side of Manhattan with the harbour. It's nestled nicely in this totally cool authentic NY neighbourhood. There is a wonderful courtyard outside that you can sit and enjoy and watch NYC life pass by the doorstep. Some other reviews were also negative about the crowds at breakfast and not being able to get seated or having to wedge around people to get to the food. HELLO! Ahem. It's NYC! OK? This isn't your palatial kitchen and dining room in your million dollar mansion wherever you are from. You aren't going to be able to have exclusive and sole access to the food. You are in a hotel. I've stayed in hotels around North America, and unfortunately, at breakfast, it can be a challenge to get your food, find a seat, and eat. GASP: you may even have to sit with a complete stranger and actually have a conversation with them! My God, isn't THAT horrible?! Seriously, folks! I'm not sure why some people even go on vacation: they don't seem to have anything good to say about anything on these reviews. Look, here's what you need to know: the rooms are clean and secure; they spray for bedbugs regularly, and laundry is picked up and cleaned daily. The staff are pleasant and helpful. The food is typical hotel fare. Considering where it is, the rooms are reasonably priced; and cozy. You'll have your own bathroom. Yes, there is no pool. But are you really coming to NYC to use the hotel pool? There is no on-site restaurant, but there about 11,000 restaurants within a 30 minute transit ride in any direction. It's a bit of a hike to Times Square, but you'll get used to that by day two and besides, you didn't come all the way to NYC just to see Times Square, did you? Book this hotel, enjoy your trip, you can thank me later :)","Peterborough, Canada","Matthew F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Peterborough, Canada</strong>",191,4.0

A few mins later we were checked in and allocated a very comfortable room on the ground floor. My only issue with the room was the noise levels from around 5am, when the staff entered the pantry located next to my room. I presume the pantry was used to start the breakfast preparations for a 630am start. I suppose the bonus of being woken early, meant that we avoided any queues at breakfast and at the major tourist attractions.

Such a friendly staff in a hotel goes a long way in my opinion.The hotel is located around 15 mins walk to Times Square and 10 mins to the nearest Subway. There is a Salvation Army accommodation located across the street, however non of the residents there caused any issues and I felt very safe in the area (possibly because I was with my husband rather than female company). There are plenty of restaurants located around the Hells Kitchen area. We tried the Westside Steak restaurant and were entirely satisfied with the meals provided.I would return to this hotel due to the friendly service, comfort of the bed, free wifi, complimentary tea and coffee and the great little outdoor seating area.","Whitley Bay, United Kingdom","JRM36</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Whitley Bay, United Kingdom</strong>",42,4.0

It was affordable and seemed like a good choice for our visit.I have many positive things to say about the hotel. The staff were very friendly. We were checked in quickly and efficiently with smiles. The real standout in friendliness was the breakfast staff who were constantly asking if we were doing OK and how our morning was. Breakfast itself was incredibly plentiful and filling with good hot and cold options to choose from.Our room was small, which was to be expected after many New York visits. I wouldn't want to spend a lot of time in the small room but it was efficiently laid out. The king bed took up most of the space but there was still room for bed side tables and a desk/closet. The bathroom was fairly cramped but still very useable. We had a nice blackout blind and well working heating/AC controls.The one negative aspect I have to say about the hotel is its location. While we recognized it was on the west side, the long three avenue walk from Times Square felt especially tiresome at night with no good subway service. We appreciated the bars around the corner (and their good happy hour) but 11th Avenue is about one avenue too far for our comfort and timeliness. I'd probably stay somewhere a little bit closer next time.Location/distance aside, this is a very comfortable property.

I waited 15 minutes until someone finally came to the front desk. The front desk agent did not even acknowledge our presence clearly seeing us standing in front of him. We waited 10 more minutes and we had to acknowledge him ourselves, he replied with ""one minute."" 5 minutes later he then said you guys are ready and here is your key, your room number and the WiFi password. I was surprised because he didn't ask any questions nor did he ask for an ID. We thought possibly since we were the only one there to check in that he assumed who we were. When we got to the 3rd floor room 313 we tried opening the door and it did not work then we realized that someone already occupied this room because someone responded saying, "" you have the wrong room."" We had to go back to front desk because clearly this front desk agent was incompetent and is clearly not doing his job. I told him what happened and to please get our name and information this time so we can get the right room. So when he took our information he came to the conclusion that we weren't booked for that time, and it was for a later time in the day, so he said he can't do anything that we would have to book another night there in order to stay that night. So I get upset because instead of trying to accommodate us and fixing the situation he was just trying to brush us off, so I ended up having to call hotwire.com for the mistake myself and fix it myself. Hotwire ended up having to speak to the same front desk agent to confirm the matter so I don't see why he couldn't have called them himself, so instead the representative from Hotwire had to fix the issue for me and we were able to stay the night. When the front desk agent gave us the key he didn't even tell us what time was breakfast or what time we check out. This service agent Pedro was very unprofessional in all forms, his tie was undone, had a very uninterested attitude. As well he basically caused a security issue, when not asking for ID before giving us a room key, and sending us up to a room that was already occupied. It seems that anyone can just walk in there get a key without paying and if they try there luck they might have a free room. This agent was the exact opposite of hospitality this will definitely make me not want to go back to this hotel.","Brooklyn, New York","Thomas V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",1,1.0

Hats off to Richard at the front desk from my hometown! Breakfast was included and was pretty good - eggs, sausage or bacon, breads, yogurt, fresh fruit and I loved the machine that made pancakes to order. Con was breakfast room was always crowded and hard to find a place to sit. The rooms were clean. Location was good. Rooms have nice flat screen TVs with great HD picture. I thought the location was pretty good and we walked to most places. Also wifi is free.Cons - Rooms are tiny, and I mean teeny tiny. The bed takes up most of the room so you can barely walk around. The bathroom is the smallest I've ever seen in my life of traveling, except for the bathrooms on cruise ships. Our air conditioner was so noisy when it was trying to maintain temperature that we could not sleep at night and the loud construction from across the street woke us up at 6am each morning. Elevators are tiny and take forever to arrive. Gym is also too small without that much equipment. The room we rented for the kids did not have toilet paper (they used the Kleenex in the room, the maid did not replace it so I had to go to the front desk on day 2 to have them bring toilet paper. Lastly, I am not from New York, so in my opinion, room is expensive for size and quality - not luxurious at all). Hotel does not have parking and the parking is very expensive. There is also no where on the street to unload without blocking traffic as the hotel does not have a driveway.","Hollywood, Florida","Samiya7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hollywood, Florida</strong>",143,3.0

The staff is very friendly and efficient, from the front desk to the breakfast area staff, and cleaning staff. This is a very budget friendly hotel for a visit to NYC! Our room was ready upon our very early arrival (11:30 am) and we were so grateful that we could get settled in. There was a water main break on 48th Street which affected the water supply for the entire block for about 12 hours. Luckily most of those hours were while we were sleeping, but the front desk supplied bottled water, and breakfast went on unaffected the next morning. The free breakfast is adequate - the coffee is plentiful and good, and food offered includes cereal, instant oatmeal, warm cinnamon rolls, scrambled eggs, bacon and/or sausage, yogurt, toast, bagels, apples, oranges, bananas, hard boiled eggs, and best of all, a cool pancake machine. Press the button and two warm, fresh pancakes come out the other end. This was always a popular part of the breakfast bar when we went down for breakfast. USA Today newspapers were available, too. Our corner 11th floor room was quiet and comfortable, with good natural light and a city view. We enjoyed running along the Hudson River walking/biking path located a few blocks west, and we especially enjoyed the Highline Trail which begins 10 blocks south, by the Javits Center. The mild January weather certainly helped! We walked to a different restaurant each night, either to the south or east. Becco on W. 46th (Restaurant Row) is our favorite!

No central location (although for us it was excellent). But ... the team ... I think that the hotel manager should be proud of such a team. Start: we arrived early in the morning, greeted us receptionist whose name I do not remember (sorry), After we offered to leave our bags in the luggage storage we were surprised when we offered to sit down for breakfast, we were not eligible for breakfast on the first day and still they invited us, already gave us a good feeling. In the dining room we got to know the most amazing hotel employee: Farrell, the man simply charmed us his courtesy, his sincere desire to make friends with us and give wholehearted service. he cared for things the kids likes to eat, when he came to recognize were we came from and knows that vegetables are part of our meals he rushed to take care that and gave us plates full of fresh vegetables for the all stay.Throughout the short stay made ​​above and beyond for us. Farrell is definitely an asset to the hotel. Thank you Farrell. As for breakfast: some reviews thought it not enough? !! What should a person nead for breakfast? There's a selection of pastries, a selection of cereals, hot and cold beverages, eggs, cheese, pancakes, waffles What else should a person ask for a successful start for his day. That was enough for us above and beyond (and especially our son whom it is hard to please when it comes to food).Hotel Location: The hotel was stated to us in an excellent location, it is just about five minutes walk with luggage from the cruis peers (we left the hotel and took a cruis from peer 88) Ten minute walk and we are in Time Square.The room we got was not the largest but fit our expectations. In any case it is in New York City and most of the day in the outdoors. Basic room with two beds, a comfortable bathroom. Definitely enough. The night before departure the kids expressed disappointment that we have to leave Farrell behind . We all agreed it was fun to stay at the hotel and we will return to it at the first opportunity.In conclusion, we all highly recommend the Holiday Inn Express New York - Manhattan West Side and thank all the staff for a wonderful stay.

The hotel is located on W 48th Street between 10 & 11 Ave (closer to 11 Ave). Customer service is very good but the breakfast is mediocre at best. The small dining area is over-crowded at all times over breakfast which is only served to 9:30 am on weekdays & 10 am on weekends. I'm on vacation so 9:30 am is too early to close up. As per NYC Transit, it's 0.55 miles (0.88 km) to the nearest subway (stop 50 St on the C.E line). Look it up, it's quite a walk.....the Avenues are very long and the Streets are short so you have to walk 2.5 long blocks East and 2 short blocks West. I wouldn't do this walk with grumpy, tired children.This hotel would be great for pre & post cruise, events at the Javit's Center (ie Comic Con) or if you want to be close to the Intrepid Museum. Otherwise, everything is accessible by subway, bus, taxi or walking a long, long way.If you are staying at this hotel, here are some tips to get to places:Central Park: take the #12 bus from 12 Ave (along the water) directly to Columbus Circle (W 59 St & 8 Ave). It goes every 20 minutes. Or walk 11 short blocks North and 2.5 long blocks East.A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder is near the 50 St subway stop.Highline walkway starts at W 34 St between 11 & 12 Ave. Walk the 14 short blocks or get on the #12 bus on 11 Ave and get off at 34 St.Intrepid Museum: Walk to 12 Ave and South along the pierGotham West Market: Walk a couple short blocks South to 600 11 Ave.The hotel offers you a shuttle to Newark for $26 per person. It's only $12.75 per person if you take the NJ Transit from Penn Station.

Walk out the front door and turn left and you can see the cruise terminal two blocks down, turn right and walk three blocks and you are in the middle of Times Square and add an extra block left and you are on the Intrepid and then everywhere in-between is Hell's Kitchen and a food orgy for any ""foodie"" . We walked all over NYC and had a ball and then came back to one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The place is immaculate and we were able to leave our luggage until we could check in on our arrival. Breakfast was wonderful but it is crowded like the other reviews say but they do provide boxes so you can take your breakfast back up to your room, which I did so I could have breakfast in bed and watch the morning news before we headed back out to enjoy New York. It was a little more expensive but I would definitely pay that again for the convenience. Compared with all the transportation cost I saved it was well worth it. Again I cannot say how wonderful the staff was. We had a little problem with our TV because of a little short in the wiring but they had someone up to our room to fix it in minutes.

It does get busy at breakfast so please be prepared to wait for a table but only 5 minutes or so. Matthew on reception is lovely, very friendly and helpful. Look out for Farrell at breakfast, what a top bloke! Always has a smile on his face and got my days off to a great start! The beds are so comfortable and the rooms are clean although those with two Queen size beds are a little small. However if you're out exploring all day, space in the bedroom is irrelevant as you'll only be using it to sleep in! Overall a great hotel.

The room was very clean & although not huge (typical of NYC) had everything you could need and especially a VERY comfortable bed and pillows. Everyone at the hotel was friendly, informative and tried their best to help with all our questions or requests. One very useful tip came from Matthew at the front desk when we were leaving for the airport. We took a cab to Penn Station and he said to ask the driver to go along 11th Avenue first - thereby avoiding a ton of traffic so saving us extra cab fare! Thanks to Matthew! The breakfast area was crowded each day but food was replaced almost the moment the platters became empty and we sat outside in the nice patio area. Good start to the day! John also helped with questions and service. There are simply too many people to Thank!! What a treat to be able to say that.

The rooms were clean, we had two double beds with a good size shower and for once the shower was both powerful and hot.

All vending machines in hotel were out of water, and instead took my money- and neither returned money and nor gave water. Hotel staff refused to give water, and finally we along with 1 more guest had an arguement with Receptionist in the night- just to get 1 water drinking bottle. Its very unfortunate and pity of this hotel, to refuse Drinking water, the bare minimum need and requirement for life, that too at the middle of night by saying lies- that we are out of water. Feel pity and disgusted at the hotel, you guys are charging so much for single night, and can't even provide Drinking water, and that too to someone when someone is in need in the middle of night.I cannot believe, how can such a big hotel be out of stock of Drinking water.

They did not have her name. How was she allowed a key just by stating that she was staying with me? The hotel did not even call, text or email me to ask if this person was, in fact, legit. I feel this was a complete breach of security on the hotel’s part. Luckily, the person given a key was not a complete stranger. But, the hotel staff did not know that. So, technically, they did give a stranger a key to my room without my knowledge. I believe this is unacceptable. I don’t understand why anyone is given a keyto a room without proper identification. If the wrong person was given a key, I hate to think what could’ve happened when my friend and I walked into that room.

The hotel was very busy during our stay and the staff was very accommodating working hard to see everyone had a great stay. Rooms in this location are a bit smaller when compared to other Holiday Inn Express locations but when visiting New York do you really want to stay in your room?? With everything from Central Park (10 blocks) to 42nd Street (6 blocks) to the Hudson River (3 blocks) this location is a perfect spot for the visitor on a budget. The only challenge we encountered was during breakfast due to the morning rush of our fellow travelers. Perhaps if we had gotten up and out a little earlier things would have been different but a bigger breakfast area would have also helped.,"Clermont, Florida","Colewa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clermont, Florida</strong>",19,4.0

The hotel is a stones throw from the area called ""Hells Kitchen"", so a good variety of different cuisines to savour.Only one negative to our stay was the rat race at breakfast time. When full the hotel only has a relatively small breakfast area, resulting in guests having to stand and wait for a table to become free. Tip here is to arrive before 08:00hrs or after 09:00hrs to avoid the peak time.

Many pluses were our experiences there. Friendly, warm staff, from front desk personnel to maintenance people and housekeeping. As has been noted before, rooms are smaller but well designed and with a little organization you can be comfortable. Breakfast can get crowded, but so many hotels do not offer you a complimentary breakfast that this is a perk that is well received. Most people enjoy their breakfast and move on so you can generally find a table. A HUGE benefit this hotel provides is the front patio type area with comfy chairs, tables etc. weather permitting, you can always enjoy your breakfast there.If you enjoy walking, the location is pretty accessible to West Side sights. Some complaints have been registered that the subway station is a ""hike""...it IS...but here's a tip...you need only visit that subway station once, when you purchase your 7 day unlimited subway/bus MetroCard at the station. Once you have that MetroCard, from the hotel you can walk to 11th Avenue and north 2 short blocks to 50th street and catch the #50 bus crosstown and hook up with other bus lines which link you wherever you want to go. BIG TIP HERE...why do any tourists want to ride subways all the time. Get a MetroCard, get a bus map (or put it on your smartphone) and ride the buses...you see everything...no transfers needed, just the best way to view the attractions of the Big Apple.

Worse than being small was the room was directly behind the elavotor shaft on one on the higher floors. Everytime the elevator would move the sound in my room was very annoying. I'm not sure what there cleanliness standard is but I was there for three nights and the room was never vacuumed. I minor spill of a nut mix was left on my floor every night.

The rooms were actually much larger than others I have stayed at in midtown Manhattan This is clearly a fairly new hotel and the decor of the room was reflective of this. It was spotless which is key for me to feel at ease. Over the weekend there was a club pumping out loud music bothFriday and Saturday which had me reaching for the earplugs but this was certainly not any fault of the hotel. I love a hotel that offers a hot breakfast and have stayed at other HIE's in California for this feature alone. It saves not only money but precious time. Breakfast was always fresh and plentiful however prepare to wait for tables to free up and to stand in line for food. We were on the go pretty early and it was always full. Patience is a must. I give mad props to the breakfast attendants - especially Farrell who despite the madness always had a sunny disposition and tried to ensure you had what you needed. In fact all of the staff were notably friendly and accommodating. They really can set the tone of your stay.

It is true that the breakfast area was crowded, but I never was unable to get a seat, and I enjoyed the cinnamon rolls others have mentioned. The location is interesting: it's farther from restaurants and the subway than other Manhattan hotels where I've stayed, but within a 10 minute walk, you have plenty of choices. What's more, the neighborhood is astonishingly quiet and restful for Manhattan, and felt much safer and in better shape than I remembered Hell's Kitchen being. I was concerned about staying west of 7th Avenue, but I need not have been--the neighborhood is just fine. It's also a fine location for a walk to see a show (I walked right up 48th to the Walter Kerr Theater) or the Intrepid Museum. So for these reasons alone, the hotel would rate a strong review from me. What pushes it up to five circles was the service. I can't remember the last time I stayed at a hotel *anywhere* that had service this good. Staff remembered that I was there to see an NIT basketball game with my alma mater Minnesota at Madison Square Garden, and asked me later how the game went. Several of them remembered who I was, including the excellent housekeeper Fabiola. When there was a small plumbing problem in my room, it was fixed within 15 minutes. The manager who you see in the comments after other reviews was a regular presence at breakfast, checking up on how people were. They also gave me a room upgrade when I let them know I was in the Holiday Inn guest card program. I appreciate enthusiastic people who do a good job, whether it's in a hotel or somewhere else. This hotel has created a culture where the staff are committed to doing just that. I'd gladly stay there again.","Augusta, Maine","James M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Augusta, Maine</strong>",334,5.0

I stay at two HIEs and based on these two experiences would choose the HIE Madison Square Garden over this one. Why? This property is more out of the way than the Madison Square Garden Property. Rather than being able to walk to Penn Station from the hotel as you can at Madison Square Garden, this will cost you a taxi ride. It also is marginally walkable to Times Square. Like the other HIEs the lobby was clean, as were the rooms and the staff was courteous and friendly. I purchased an ""upgraded"" room with a ""city view"" and what I got was a higher floor, but I wouldn't call looking at cooling ducts a city view. So is given the choice, I would not may the extra money for the view. Breakfast can be tricky as often there will be a tour bus full of passengers making their way into or out of the hotel and the breakfast lounge will be very crowded. Timing your meal offers some respite, but the fare is pretty ordinary. If you are there for more than two days, you will definitely want to find a local cafe to avoid the powdered scrambled eggs and paper thin bacon. That said, it's included in the price of the room.So given the option I would choose the Madison Garden HIE, but otherwise this is a resonable price for what you get in NYC.","Portland, Oregon","tracytC5333OT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",34,3.0

The rooms are small and the bathroom is smaller (we had three people sharing rooms). This was ok because we spent little time at the hotel. I definitely recommend this hotel.","Springdale, Utah","Patty H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Springdale, Utah</strong>",2,5.0

The hotel is located on 48th and 11 so that it's 2 streets and 3 avenues away from Subway A, C and E (blue line) - about 10 blocks or 10-minute walk. It's right across a construction site and a Salvation Army shelter for the homeless. If you need to park a car, there are ICON Parking lots about 2 blocks away.You'll need to walk to 9th avenue to get to the foodie scene of Hell's Kitchen. Everything was good except that the hotel management forgot to notify hotel guests of the ongoing construction across the hotel. I had a dinner and party on the night I checked in, and got home fairly late - around 3 AM. I went to bed around 330 AM. I woke up abruptly around 7AM to the tune of jackhammering and pile hammering. Unfortunately, my room is facing the construction site next to the Salvation Army shelter for the homeless. My room was on the 8th floor, but the noise from the jackhammers is still very loud.I called the front desk around 730 AM and told them about the issue and they can only offer me ear plugs. I requested for a late checkout, and they gladly gave me one as I thought the jackhammering wil subside after a couple of hours. I tried going back to sleep but the pile hammering was relentless and incessantly annoying that I went in and out of sleep for a couple of hours until finally I couldn't bear the noise and had called up again and spoken to the hotel director to let her know of the situation. She said that it's too late for me to be transferred to another room since I am checking out a few hours later. She said that the construction workers are contracted to do work from 7AM-5PM. The jackhammering was non-stop from 7AM to 1PM when I checked out. I just hoped that the hotel management let the hotel guests beforehand that there will be construction noise throughout the day so that guests are prepared. All in all I got about 3 hours of sleep that day, and a goodnight's sleep is and should be the most important priority of hotels to their guests.","Deerfield Beach, Florida","Rals L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Deerfield Beach, Florida</strong>",1,3.0

The room itself was small, and the desk space was limited due to the lamp, but otherwise it was a good clean space. There was a fridge in the room, which was a great bonus.The hotel has a great seating area outside, a good place to wait for a ride or to relax.It is between 10th and 11th Ave, so a good 5 mins to the crowds, but I liked this.

I was first very surprised that people in the hotel knew about my case, because it was written in my folio, but all people I talked to denied that the hotel had anything to do with not being able to book my second night, so clearly or this is a big misunderstanding and lack of communication between IHG and the hotel, or someone is lying to me. Anyway, the hotel is average, not good or bad as first impression, room is small, but comfortable, but not very clean, there were towels behind the door from the guests who stayed before, so I was wondering what else was not cleaned. Could not sleep as a group has arrived at 3 am and walls are paper thin, they were yelling for one hour... Next day I had to transfer to another hotel, I had two suitcases and two small children and the only help from the hotel was to walk a block to 11th Av. to hail a taxi, of course by my self, as nobody would help.

As with many hotels that have free breakfasts the area was very crowded and and was challenging to get to the food most days. Thankfully there was a great outside lounging area that could be used to take food to. Coming from an area where smoking in common space has limitations the proximity to cigarette smoke on the common patio was overwhelming occasionally.

It's expensive to stay anywhere in Manhattan and despite being a holiday inn express we paid $182 per night compared to about £59 in the UK for the same brand of hotel. Also no matter where you stay in Manhattan it's noisy so accept it !! Unfortunately a cross the road from the hotel at the moment is building work going on and they work Monday to Friday.Now the positives !!!We stayed here for 4 nights after travelling across from the UK on the QM 2 and arrived at the hotel at 9am expecting just to be able to drop our luggage off. We were greeted with a very polite welcome from the reception staff and told that a room was already available. They gave us a welcome bag with 2 bottles of water and a couple of local guides. The room was ample with 2 queen size beds and a decent bathroom. We found location wise it was in a safe area and only 10 mins walk from Times Square. Every time we left or arrived at the hotel, staff were very polite and acknowledging. Breakfast was a big plus as many new york hotels don't offer it and whilst busy the choice was good and always being replenished.The bed was comfy and whilst we heard noise outside it didn't ruin our sleep at all.Upon leaving the staff were very friendly again and thanked us for our stay.I can't fault the hotel, location or staff and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to pay less than $200 per night in New York.","London, United Kingdom","canberralover69</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",86,5.0

The front desk staff was very pleasant upon check-in. Our king-bed room was spotless, however small. No complaints for the small room, as we're used to that in big cities. When I made the reservation, I did request a room on an upper floor, but we were only put on the 2nd floor. Since we were only there for one night, I didn't complain. I did notice that when people were talking in the hallway, it was rather loud in our room. When the AC fan was turned on high, it nicely drowned out any hallway noise. The next morning however, the construction site across the street was in full swing around 7am, and this noise could not be disguised by the AC. I don't even know if a higher floor room would have made much difference. Fortunately the construction should only last for a limited time.The complimentary breakfast was very nice, and the additional outdoor seating was quite necessary when breakfast was busy.One suggestion to the hotel would be to make the outdoor cigarette receptacles more obvious for guests. I noticed the smoking guests dropping their ashes and butts onto the patio, (hopefully) because they didn't notice the small receptacles in the corner. If I stay here again, I would make sure I was on an upper floor (above 7 or 8), and possibly ask for a non-street facing room, to escape the street noise.","Franklin, Massachusetts","SnoSearchT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Franklin, Massachusetts</strong>",43,4.0

The nearest subway is probably 4 blocks, although Times Square is only a block or two farther.The hotel was extremely well run; the staff was very friendly, knowledgeable, and on top of everything.

This is actually pretty unusual in a tourist hotel in NY in the summer, so they get high marks from me on in this regard. The hotel seemed very full, which made finding a seat at breakfast a challenge sometimes, but they have a great seating area in front of the hotel outside, which was very nice on sunny mornings.My room was small by normal standards, although quite large for a hotel of this class in Manhattan.

As other posters have mentioned, this is a brand spanking new hotel, and so if you're the kinda guy/gal that gets new car scent air fresheners, this is probably a place you will have on your ""Hotels in NYC to stay at"" list. The entire stay was average. Nothing spectacular, and nothing horrendous. Further details below:The Good:- It's new. As in, some of the door hinges still have plastic stuck to them (like they were just purchased from Home Depot and installed yesterday night kind of a feel).- The staff are friendly.- They offer free breakfast, for those on a budget. See below, though.- Two computers are available for your use, with a free printer. Though usually they seemed to be occupied by 12 year olds on Youtube. Don't their parents realize that Youtube is a pretty bad babysitter?- WiFi is reasonably speedy, and free.- For Priority Club members with any status, your gift is chocolate and chips.The Bad:- Location. There is a Salvation Army directly across the street. No, not the store where you buy used clothes when you're trying to be hip, or finding a Hallowe'en costume. Like a place where people who are down on their luck are living. Be aware that you are several blocks away from the main thoroughfares, meaning you walk through at least a few questionable residential buildings before arriving at the hotel. During my stay, I never felt unsafe. Did I feel as safe as I would have if I were staying in the middle of Times Square (albeit, at a hotel that costs 5x as much)? No. I just wouldn't want to be walking home, as an attractive female, by myself at 3AM. But then again, where would that ever be safe?- The breakfast was free, meaning their offerings were average, at best. Standard Holiday Inn fare (do they all shop at the same discount food provider?), meaning lots of carbs, and little in the way of fresh products. Waffle makers, cinnamon buns, bacon, eggs etc. are available. If you're trying to be on an anti-typical-American-diet and doing the whole health thing, your best bets will be limited to oranges and oatmeal. Also, the crowds are nuts. It's like they were serving gourmet fare or something. Lineups starting as soon as they opened the breakfast.- The elevator/rooms situation. The elevators are about the size of the rooms. As in, they're both postage sized. Elevators are slow during prime times, to the point where I just started taking the stairs. And try fitting in two big people with their suitcases... it ain't going to happen. The rooms are the size of your bathroom at home.- Sound proofing. Why can't hotels do this properly? I don't get it. They understand you are there to sleep, but can't make sure you are in a quiet room. We could hear night club music all night long, and as much as I love Kaskade, I don't want that blaring when I'm sleeping.The Ugly:- The clientele. There are some groups of people who are obnoxious, and they apparently all love to stay at this hotel. My fiancee was pushed (yes, pushed) off an elevator because she did not immediately step off once the door opened.In summary, you could do better if you were willing to spend a little more. But then if that was the case, why would you be looking at the Holiday Inn chain? It wasn't a bad experience, and I'd stay again if the price was right. If I could, 3.5 stars would be a reasonable rating.","Los Angeles, California","JasonArroyo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",234,3.0

The room was clean, comfortable and did not experience any issues with the lifts.

When we returned in the evening the hotel has a pleasant outside seating area where you can sit down and socialise. Luis from reception arranged a Taxi for us to Newark airport which accidentally turned out to be a stretched limo at the same price as a regular taxi (plus toll & tip).

That's a plus. But, this hotel is more like a small, boutique hotel with European-sized rooms.

I feel the hotel should say that in their advertisement upfront and should charge an appropriate price for the rooms which is affordable. This is not a good deal for a family of four or more. The double rooms are really only large enough for two adults, and that's a stretch. The Salvation Army shelter across the street does not have a curfew because you can hear men outside all hours of the night and a radio going. Then, there is construction next door to it that starts the minute the sun comes up. We felt the entire stay was noisy and uncomfortable and regretted that we didn't book somewhere else. I feel this property is best for college kids or singles who don't travel with extensive luggage or a family in tow. Other than that, it was clean and convenient.

I was never concerned with the Salvation Army across the street and the price paid was decent for NYC.I do, however, want to elaborate about housekeeping. I'm sure the GM reads these reviews and this may be the first she learns of it. The first day my room was cleaned as it should have been. On the second day my room was cleaned very late in the day - after 5:30. Very annoying to come back to after being in the city the whole day. When I got back that evening housekeeping had visited and done the following: made the bed, left two bath towels. That's all. No toiletries, no, washcloths, no bath mat. The trash wasn't emptied and the ice bucket remained full from the previous night with melted ice. The next morning I left at 9:30 am. I specifically asked that my room be cleaned sooner rather than later. I saw the desk agent write it down in a notebook. Apparently that's as far as my request went. I got back to the room at 5:30pm. The room had not been touched. I went to the desk and the solution was to move me to another room three floors up. I guess this was a so-so fix since I didn't want to wait for HK to service the room, but I was ticked off. I was promised a phone call from the manager by ""9 or 10, but no later than 10"" that night. Not a peep. The next morning at checkout I requested some kind of financial remuneration. I was credited $100, which I appreciated. The point is that this never should have happened. The HK supervisors should be replaced - there's no excuse for doing a poor job like that.Would I stay here again? No. Coming back to a dirty room, in my opinion, is a severe compromise of the contract you make with the hotel when you book.","Atlanta, Ga","BobZAtlanta_Ga</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Ga</strong>",65,3.0

We walked back from the Top of the Rock evening lights experience through Hells kitchen at 9pm to the hotel and did not feel at all worried for our safety . The salvation army office causes not problems, there are plenty more 'down on their luck' people on other street corners teaching my children 'new words' that caused more problems.

This was the case this past week at our first stay at the NEW Holiday Inn Express on Manhattan's West Side. We will most certainly be back again! The staff here were earnestly and promptly happy to help as our needs evolved throughout our stay. Starting with Richard Bailey, who expertly handled all of our special requests before our arrival, and continuing on with supervisor Farrah Francois, and front desk supervisors Luis and Aniket, the staff truly embodied the phrase ""service with a smile."" Latch, in engineering, could not be more pleasant when correcting a small problem with our room. All responses to our questions and needs were swift, cheerful, helpful, and professional. Kudos to this great crew! It is often hard to ""get things right"" when a hotel first opens. The lead staff at this hotel work very hard to do so!

I chalked them up to it being a new hotel and I am glad I did. First and foremost, the staff was exceptional. Everybody (yes, everybody) was not only pleasant, but outright nice AND helpful...sometimes unusual in New York. Second, the location was good, but they can't do anything about that. The street is quiet so you might have to walk to 10th or 11th Aves to get a taxi. The walk to the subway isn't too bad, but the E only goes downtown. Very close to Restaurant Row and certainly walking distance to any of the B'way theaters/Times Sq etc. I booked 2 rooms and arrived at noon. Both rooms were ready for check-in. Very nice. Yes, the rooms are small but comfortable. Comfy beds, nice pillows, great shower. The elevators can be slow especially at check out time. There is also a lot of employee activity on the elevators that takes precious usage away from guests. Unfortunately, there is no service elevator. The stairs are definitely an option and I used them frequently.I took advantage of the location to secure a spot for the 4th fireworks. Left the hotel at 8:10 and walked to the Hudson and had a great spot by 8:20. The fireworks started at 9:30. I saw many people stream down to the river much earlier and I would be hard pressed to say they had a better view than I did. I was right by the USS Intrepid and the fireworks just overhead. No complaints. The room I was in did have a partial view of the fireworks according to my mom who stayed behind to watch from there.Lots of restaurants, delis, nightlife etc all within walking distance. All in all, a great place. Oh, yeah...for now, you might want to avoid if you are one to take afternoon naps. Not sure why you would in NYC, but the construction on 48th St. can be noisy.","Orlando, Florida","Bob D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",11,5.0

Before booking, I called to see if July 4 fireworks could be seen from hotel rooms and was assured that some rooms could accommodate that. So, I booked, a room facing the Hudson. Our train was on a lengthy delay so my daughter (who lives in the city) checked in for us to be sure we got the room. We got to the room to discover that not only were we not facing the Hudson but on the opposite end of the hotel. I was told no other rooms available.. In the morning, we went down to breakfast, returning to discover we were ""locked out"" of our room due to a malfunction. Back to the desk. New keys, back upstairs, keys didn't work. We did this FOUR TIMES, each time having to wait in very lengthy lines to even get to the desk. Finally, a mechanic was sent up to fix the door. Back down for new keys, back up to discover they didn't work. Long story short, we were locked out of our room until 230 pm. When the maid let us is, we discover the room hadn't even been cleaned. At that time, I got yet another set of keys, which didn't work. I called downstairs asking for a manager. Called again at 315 and demanded the manager who finally came up. I continued to be locked out of the room and had to check in at the desk to get into my room. So, I had a room I basically didn't utilize for the day, couldn't shower, missed meeting friends in Times Square. HORRIBLE. I have lost my faith in holiday inn chain.

Just a very short walk to times square etc. and we had no problems with the area. We always felt safe, even at night and hardly even noticed the Salvation Army offices.The downsides were really minor; yes the elevator is slow! We did not try the breakfast because the breakfast room was overly crowded when we went there (but there are lots of places nearby to have a real American breakfast). Lastly, the construction site in front of the hotel is a problem if you are waking up after 7.00 a.m. (we weren't due to jet-lag!).

In June 2013, it was a completed building, occupying the space of a former very old apartment building, on a predominantly residential street. It is two blocks east of the Hudson River. (Remember Captain Chesley B. “Sully” Sullenberger’s remarkable landing in the river?) Discovered it, quite by accident, in an online search. It is beautifully constructed to fit the existing décor of the area. I have stayed in many Holiday Inn Express’s throughout our great country. This one is definitely the best! From the very first contact, the staff were unbelievably friendly, helpful and cordial. The rooms were designed by an architect who knew a lot about organization and valuable space saving. The room layout is small but very easy to live in. More than usual recepticles. Cleanliness of the room & common areas was impeccable. I was on the 10th floor of eleven, on the south side of the building, with a great view of the local city skyline. I have NEVER seen stairwells, all eleven floors, so clean! I am a frequent user of stairwells, especially at this hotel! Quiet stairwell exit doors. The prices of the rooms are reasonable for NYC, but expensive for me. I received a “senior” discount which reduced the price of the room substantially.The negatives were livable: VERY slow elevators (2) & a breakfast not suitable for healthy eating, but passable. There are plenty of good places to eat within a four block radius of the hotel.I would definitely recommend this hotel as a NYC place to stay. It’s location from the nearest subway station is four blocks to the blue line train at 50th street, but an easy walk. In my opinion, the best way to get around NYC is by subway. Depending on the length of stay, the best dollar deal is to purchase the 7 day unlimited Metro Pass for $30. A regular priced subway is $2.50 for EACH ride, no matter how long or short the ride. The Metro Pass allows unlimited rides during a seven day period, and the seven day period begins with your first ride.No laundry facility onsite, but there is a “wash & fold” laundromat less than a block away. I did not use the exercise room, but it looked well equipped.","Winchester, Virginia","Michael D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winchester, Virginia</strong>",92,4.0

The hotel is new so it is in very nice. The location is about 4 blocks from time square. The size of the room was adequate as well. The problem with most hotels is it's housekeeping and this hotel is no exception. Upon getting my room key, we discovered that the room had not been prepared. The bed was unmade and housekeeping was just like ""ummmmmmm, I dunno"" The lady at the desk was very apologetic and put us in another room. Everything was fine until the next day after we got in about 11:00 pm and discovered that housekeeping didn't replenish ANY towels. We had to call the front desk to get towels. This was a true inconvenience since we were dog tired when we made it back to the room. A maintenance man brought us about 20 towels, unfortunately they were all bath towels. I left the remaining pile of towels on the floor the next day hoping that housekeeping would give us the correct quantities of towels, both large and small. NOPE, the pile of towels were still on the floor and the trash can was not even emptied. Not only that our soap was never replaced by housekeeping. I had to go down stairs and get a bar. I understand that they were just opening up a few days before my arrival, but the housekeeping situation was just unacceptable. I hope they have gotten these issues resolved as this is a nice hidden gem. I would be willing to stay here again, but would quickly choose another hotel if the same housekeeping issues remain.

In 20 years of travel I have NEVER been this disappointed and this is the first time that I have ever posted a review because I was so disappointing with the hotel experience. You arrive to a hotel that has a Salvation Army with homeless people loitering around the front, the photo the hotel has put up on Trip Advisor are 3D model interpretations of the place - the front looks nothing like what is shown and trust me, you wouldn't want to hang out there even if they had the nice looking outdoor area. Staff in the hotel have attitude and are not helpful. While there was a couple of them who actually appreciated guest (none at front desk) most of the staff have a real attitude and seem to hate having customers there. My favorite part was the act they put on when management is around only to turn back to their usual selves as soon as they disappeared. The room was spacious but that's about where it ends. It was poorly finished and was obviously rushed, the TV didn't work and needed a technician to come and fix it. The carpets are already dirty and overall disappointing for a hotel that just opened. Images of rooms on this site are 3D models - so don't bother with them and wait for someone to upload some pictures. While the air conditioning was noisy it was a pleasant occasional relief from the noise in this hotel. Doors bang VERY loud every time someone opens them, street noises are MUCH louder than other parts of New York and basically I didn't get any sleep while there. Breakfast was like a pig farm where the animals are let to the trough. Food was always finished, poorly organized, short staffed and requests by guests to staff for more food were ignored along with accompanying eye rolls. Guests were clambering over each other to get a extra slice of bread. House keeping is generally terrible as well - rooms have to be requested to be cleaned and even that sometimes doesn't guarantee that the room is made!Management PLEASE MYSTERY STAY this hotel if you want to stay open!! Check in various people of different ethnicity and you'll realize what a problem you have! While I sometimes have average stays this one actually made me angry enough to write this review.

Front desk was very nice and eager to assist with our needs. Rooms very attractive with a refrigerator and the views from the 14 line high floor were very nice. Very busy hotel in breakfast was packed but they had everything in order eggs and bacon.

I booked a room at this hotel online May 9th with a friends and family rate. After I looked at the price, I hit submit and a confirmation page came up saying I had the advance purchase rate which was $200 higher than the rate I had just seen on the page! I called the holiday inn 800 number immediately as the hotel had not yet opened and they said someone would contact me within 48 hours (which they didn't). When I called back a few days later I was basically called a liar and they said I chose the advance purchase rate. I told them I did not, and they told me it was up to the manager of the hotel and she was the only one who could modify the rate and it was at her discretion and they would have her call me within 48 hours (which she did not). Never did get to talk to the manager due to them transferring me elsewhere or they said she was not there...Long story short, Ive called the hotel and holiday inn's main number and they kept transferring me and putting me on hold and I have spent over two hours combined on the phone for nothing. They won't fix my rate because they claim it wasn't their fault. It is non-refundable and cannot be cancelled according to them. I do not want a refund or to cancel I just wanted the rate I chose! They say they have a screenshot showing the advance purchase rate, who cares! So do I because that is what came up when I hit submit but that is not what it said BEFORE I hit submit!! So aggravated! I will update on the actual hotel itself in a few weeks, but this is the LAST time I will stay here!","Shreveport, Louisiana","morgansmom85</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shreveport, Louisiana</strong>",4,2.0

They ran out of all breakfast components on both mornings. I asked them why they weren't prepared for the next day when they ran out the day before and the repsonse was, ""We don't get deliveries on weekends"". I guess there are no stores in NYC, I walked less than a block to a Bodega and they had plenty of eggs and bacon and cereal. They didn't clean our room on day #2, I ran into the housekeeping manager and asked for towels, he brought us four bathmats. I explained this all at checkout and they said they were going to comp our stay, this has yet to happen and it was six days ago, ""they did said give us a couple hours"" they didn't say which hours and on what day. On an upnote the rooms are nice and comfy.","Bloomingdale, New York","goodguyew</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bloomingdale, New York</strong>",20,2.0

Here is how our stay began...Check in was quick and painless. LOCATION - Across the road from the Salvation Army with dirty people handing out the front day and night. It feels unsafe and horrible.SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX - Our travel requirement in each hotel is a safety deposit box and we always confirm this before booking. When i asked the young girl where their safety deposit box she looked at me blankly and ""Are you checking out?"" 'Um, no, we need a safety deposit box'. She replied ""Im not sure what it is"". She went to ask the manager. We were informed they didnt have any. Why advertise it then?? RAN OUT OF FOOD - Breakfast is included in the room rate. When i came down for breakfast there were a lot of unhappy customers as the food had run out only 1hr into breakfast. Not even a slice of toast. My husband and i had a lemon tea. At least they had cups and tea bags. When i asked the staff if there was anymore food they just walked off. How can you run out of food when you promise breakfast??HOUSEKEEPING - Housekeeping from 9-5pm. We were out of the room from 11am - 3pm. When i got back hoping to have a nap as i was tired from walking in the sun all day i called reception asking if housekeeping was going to come before they finished for the day. They said someone would be at the room right away. 45 minutes later i called reception again. THey said they would send someone right away. After 20 more minutes reception was nice enough to call me to ask if the cleaner had come yet, and i told her we were still waiting. The cleaner was really apologetic when she came and she worked quickly so we could get back into our room which was sweet of her. SECURITY - Bring your valuable with you. All the cleaners wear uniforms, but we noticed one was in casual clothes helping a cleaner in uniform on another floor. WTF!! i dont want ANYONE besides the cleaner in my room at ANY time. What kind of security is this??CUSTOMER SERVICE - The staff have attitude towards customer queries or complaints. Both experienced and observed towards other customers. DIRTY - The hotel hallway was disgusting for days, it looked like it hadnt been vaccuumed in a week. It was so gross. I have attached photos. There was a box of rubbish left in the hallway next to a door to an empty unfurnished concrete room. The door to the unfurnished concrete room was left open blowing dirt, dust and debris into the hallway. UNPROFESSIONAL - Unprofessional, unscripted emergency testing announcements. NOISY - Noisy people in the hallway and people yelling and smashing things in the street. BAD FINISHES - BUDGET hotel roughly finished. THe shower floor had brown patches, the grout was messy and the wallpaper was sliced with a stanley knife near the light switch.Positive attributes - The a/c is very efficient, the room is comfortable and brand new but the bathroom is very tight. This hotel was full of Asians, Indians & Muslims.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!!",perth,"sarprinni</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>perth</strong>",27,1.0
