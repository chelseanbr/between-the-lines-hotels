However, it seems like times have changed. This time, about two weeks before our stay, I emailed with the hotel / front desk to book two interconnected rooms. I was told I had a reservation and a price. A few days before we should arrive, I asked the hotel to reconfirm, which they did, but the price had gone up! After some back & forth they accepted the original price. When we landed in Tokyo Haneda, we called the hotel to finally reconfirm, as the correspondence had been slightly confusing. Then it turned out that they did not have any interconnecting rooms, and had no reservation in my name. Basically, they had no idea what we were talking about.Needless to say, we immediately booked another hotel. And by that maneuver we discovered that the price we had been quoted from the hotel was more than double from what we would pay for Royal Park, if we booked via hotel-dot-com.I am thus sorry to say that this hotel seems to have some serious issues with providing good service towards international costumers.",Copenhagen,"Mer21maid</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Copenhagen</strong>",141,1.0

Asked if they could accommodate room only without lounge and breakfast but with a lower rate, no response. Asked if anything could be done, no response. This is very unacceptable.

The last time I heard so many ""no's"" I was five and talking to my mother. For starters, there is no gym as it is under construction until June, something found nowhere on their or any other website that we saw. OK this is necessary from time to time but any hotel boasting four stars would make arrangements with a local gym to take care of their guests during their stay. When I mentioned this obvious solution to the Asst. Manager Mr. Yamamoto I was met with such indifference that I was worried he had narcolepsy. I could go on but why bother. If they can't even fake customer concern right in front of us then I am sure no review will move them.

As an executive manager in the industry, I was disappointed. PLEASE GET WITH IT!!! Or lower your prices and don’t call yourself a five star hotel. BEGINNING of LETTERRoom 1249 May 6, 2018First of all, I want to know who gave you a five star rating? You should be ashamed.  Let me share with you just a couple of things. As an ex assistant food and beverage manager/director of places like the Tokyo Bay Hilton and the Tokyo American Club, having been out of the industry for close to 20 years, I really had a great expectation of staying in your hotel.  Let’s start with check in. We came in at 9:30 AM just to drop our luggage and had a slim hope that if our room was ready, it would be great, but of course the front desk was very courteous and let us know that our room would be ready by 3 PM. So we dropped our luggage in front of the front desk lady and she was watching us as the staff picked up our luggage, seeing clearly that we had a two-year-old daughter.  As I was busy in a meeting on the 18th floor for most of the day, I found out later that somehow our room became available around 10 AM and my wife was checked in and luggage was already in the room which made us feel very safe and happy.  We finished our meeting around 3 PM and as we saw we cannot order glasses of wine from the room service menu, I bought a bottle somewhere else and we had a couple of glasses before we headed out to dinner. ¥3300 for a cheese assortment? Wow.My wife had been in the room all day and noticed the coffee maker was very dirty, the envelopes in the desk drawer were crinkled, there was dust everywhere and the window looking out into Tokyo had wallpaper that was peeling from the edge of the window. Definitely in need of repair. When I went to the room, she showed me these things; I was taken aback. So therefore I called and asked for the Housekeeping Supervisor to come in, and I showed him all of the dust in the room, the coffee maker, the desk where the paperwork was stored and asked him if there was anything he could do about it.  We were heading out to dinner and I asked him if he could take care of it while we were gone, in which he did. Very nice and professional. And do you know something? When we returned, not only was everything in better shape to match the standards of a five-star hotel, he had a baby‘s toothbrush placed in the bathroom and little baby slippers near the entrance.  So I wondered at that time, why weren’t these items presented beforehand? When we were checking in, or should I say when we attempted to check in, the front desk receptionist clearly saw we had a child and could have noted to housekeeping to ensure that these items were already placed. Upon my wife’s check in at 10 AM, she was greeted by three different housekeepers on the floor cleaning rooms. Did not any of them see a two-year-old in tow and check the checklist to see if there was a child in room?Understand, that I would not have expected these items to be there in the first place but since they were placed there later, it made me wonder why they were NOT placed there in the first place. A five-star resort or hotel would have noticed little things like that and already have ensured that that service had been completed.  Not to say a five-star hotel housekeeping department would’ve had someone come in with a white glove and ensure there is no dust in the room at all, because we don’t want to mention the air cleaner that’s in the room. The Housekeeping department would’ve also ensured that the coffee maker was perfectly clean.  Well anyway, in food and beverage, we are constantly putting out fires. So it’s not how many problems you have in a day, but it’s how you react to those issues. You take care of the customer issue first, then the next day you talk about it in management and figure out how to react to it in the future.  That of course, brings me to my second issue. My wife and I were watching a movie and it included a scene where someone was eating Ramen. We had already taken our baths for the evening, and since we have a two-year-old child, we did not want to leave the room so we looked at the room service menu.  Udon was on the menu but not Ramen. Not only one udon, but two. TWO!!!! But I called room service anyway. I asked them if they had Ramen and they said you could come down and have the Ramen in the restaurant but they could not deliver it, though they could deliver other items from that particular Chinese restaurant.  To be honest, this made me mad.  Not only because you could do it, it was because the person on the other end of the phone, bluntly was disrespectful with an attitude.  Instead of apologizing and offering me an alternative, for example, “I am sorry sir but we do not offer Ramen from this particular restaurant at this time but if you call this number this particular company can offer this particular Ramen to deliver to the hotel.” This guy told me that he could not do it so I responded asking him if this hotel does not provide ‘Omotenashi’ service? You know hell, being a five star rated hotel and everything, then which he gave me attitude and said, no we don’t do it.  I think it was the attitude that set me off because I have bent over backwards ensuring that guest got what the they wanted, going up and beyond the call of duty to take care of the customer first and ask questions later. You can even charge them, you know, and they are fine with it.  So this is not about Ramen. This is not about how I had to go to Family Mart across the street and buy my wife some stupid box Ramen, when I am staying in the Royal Park (5 STAR) Hotel.  What this is about is a five star rating and making your customer do something that you should have provided in the first place. The person that I called at room service, the two individuals that were in the lobby that I explained my issue to; there was no one to step up to the plate and fix this issue. If it had been me that had come into contact with the customer with this issue I would’ve told him to return to their room and I would be there with their Ramen, no questions asked. You are a five-star resort and you failed on some stupid issue!!! You have got to be kidding me. Are you going to come up with some stupid excuse to tell me why you could not deliver some stupid noodles to some room for some customer that’s paying for five star experience? So the thing is, you don’t know if I’m just a regular Joe, or someone who writes for the Travel Channel. And it should not matter. You should provide OMOTENASHI. Especially if you want to be called a five-star resort. In return of an ‘I’m sorry letter’, what I would like to see is that you maybe gather your management team and go over what it means to be a five-star hotel in Tokyo and begin treating customers with that type of service.Or maybe just forget it. Because evidently you don’t care right now. Thank you for your time.","Suita, Japan","Hawk H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Suita, Japan</strong>",14,2.0

Despite it claiming to be a four-star hotel, this is more a three-star standard business hotel, especially for those who're used to staying at the international chains, like Hyatt and Starwood. Firstly, the hotel's location isn't fantastic, with nothing much within a 20-minute walking radius. While the easy access to a subway line helps, it typically takes several transfers to get to they key districts, other than Shibuya, which is perhaps 30 minutes away by subway.Secondly, the service was rather mixed. The staff at the front desk, in particular, wasn't very friendly. I faced difficulties communicating in English in a few occasions.Thirdly, I was shocked that I had to pay for access to the gym. Seems like this is somewhat common especially among the older Japanese hotels, but it just doesn't feel right for a supposedly four-star hotel to impose additional charges for something as basic as gym access.Lastly, the rooms were slightly dated and dimly lit, not in a hip way. The room just felt rather dull even with all the lights switched on.That said, I think the price is rather reasonable by Tokyo standards, and the rooms were of a decent size.","Singapore, Singapore","ChesterChua</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",40,3.0

The room: small as expected-we had to put one piece of luggage on the desk; air qualityvin the room was good due to a purifier device, but the hallway on our floor wad poorly ventilated and there was an unpleasant (but bearable) odor; the room - while very clean like everything else in Japan-felt outdated;4. Breakfast was very expensive at around 3,500 yen per person, so we had it around the hotel (there’s a Jonathan’s about 5 mins away on foot).

The other time, she did not keep the bedroom slippers properly as the other days and left lying untidily somewhere.

I thought the hotel was great, as was the staff. I stayed in a queen room on the executive level (floors 15-19). Check-in was smooth and easy and the room was very well kept. Most of the employees took a great amount of pride in their work and didn’t accept gratuities. I highly recommend the executive level as it includes an Android cell phone with free long distance and internet, access to the Executive lounge (20th floor) for a Western breakfast buffet daily, snacks and beverages throughout the afternoon and three hours of happy hour and appetizers every evening. The executive lounge is not a bar and there is no bartender, but they do put a variety of liquor bottles on the counter for happy hour, including snacks, soft drinks and beer. In addition, the views are very nice on the 20th floor. This hotel is conveniently located above the Hanzomon (purple line) subway line (Suitengumae Station is in basement of hotel) and the T-CAT (Tokyo City Air Terminal) bus station (covered catwalk to station is on 2nd floor). The hotel offers discount train and bus tickets at front desk. For example, a three day unlimited subway ticket costs 1,500 yen and a bus ticket to Haneda airport was only 780 yen. The hotel restaurants and bars are nice and I really enjoyed the cigar bar in the basement, but they can be pricey, even by hotel standards. For example, a mixed drink (non-premium) was about 1,900 yen and their Chinese restaurant was over the top. They charged us 2,300 yen for a single serving size order of fried rice (we had to get 3 orders for 4 people), 1,450 yen for a draft beer and they wouldn’t allow us to take our leftovers with us, which I found a bit offensive. But, other than not recommending the Chinese restaurant, I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay here on my next visit. On a side note, if you feel the hotel’s bars are a bit pricey, go across the street to BarLey Suitengumae. BarLey is a fantastic little bar with a very large/nice selection of bourbons, whiskeys and scotches for about half the price of the hotel cigar bar. This bar takes great pride in every cocktail they craft, including using the proper ice (or ice ball) for the proper drink, custom cutting it when needed. You have to see it to believe it.

Furniture in the room was also a throwback to a different era. Whilst the hotel has a number of restaurants I was shocked by the extortionate prices which even though my business was picking up the tab were incredibly high.

The rooms at Royal Park are comfortable, spotless, and quiet. If your Budget allows, Upgrade to the Executive rooms. They come with separate check-in on the 20th floor, breakfast, and evening cocktails. The Japanese restaurant Gengi-koh on the 5th floor serves excellent as does Sumida teppanyaki on the 20th floor. If you are at the hotel for several days, try the Chinese restuarant as well as the sushi bar on the lower floors. Restuarant Fontaine in the lobby serves very good Western dishes as well as Japanese noodle dishes. There is also a buffet opportunity.

The location is great because it's not very busy if that's what you are looking for. There are some nearby restaurants as well that is worth trying out. I remember eating at this ramen place (I forget the name but it was yummy). There's a 7-11 around the corner and a family mart right across the street. The -1 star is for the extra charge to use the gym which my bf and I used 4x ($25 per person/per day). But all in all we had an awesome experience here. The room is definitely roomier compared to what we stayed in Osaka or Kyoto (bigger than your typical Japanese hotel). Another plus is the transportation bus station to the left side of the hotel, which had restaurants inside as well and for small amount you can take the bus to the airport and it's cheaper than a taxi that's for sure.",,Mlazaro2323,1,4.0

It had been 4 years since my last visit there. As soon as I walked into the lobby it was exactly as I had remembered it. Nice. Elegant. When I got to my room, I turned on the air conditioning because the room was warm. The room was clean and nicely furnished. I was trying to remember why I stopped staying here. I grabbed my stuff and headed to the executive lounge on the 20th floor. This was new. The old exec lounge was on the 16th floor and was quite small, tired, and kind of dingy. But this new lounge was an entire corner of the building and was fabulous. Open, airy, with some amazing views. I logged onto the free Wifi and checked the speed - 20 Mbps download and 21 upload. Pretty good. Why did I stop coming here, I thought? I worked for a few hours and had a couple of free drinks during happy hour, closed up, and went back to the room to get ready for dinner. That was when it hit me. I went back to the room and it was still really warm. It had not dropped a degree it felt like. Then I remembered. The air conditioning sucks here. I called the front desk to complain and they promptly sent up an engineer. He replaced the airtake filter because it was filthy and clogged. He tinkered inside the air vent, closed it, and said that would take care of it. It did not. All night, and every night I was there, I was miserable. I would wake up in the middle of the night, hot, and sweating. I told this story to a friend of mine who had stayed there and he said the same thing. When he complained, they sent someone up to his room to look at his unit, but it did not change a thing. He thought they were trying to do some kind of placebo effect to make us feel cooler.Later that night I met friends at the Chinese restaurant in the hotel. We had the hotel special for $50 a person, which was about half the usual cost we were told. With drinks it was ~$400 for 6 people. While the food was good, it was way overpriced, and I left kind of hungry. I was reminded of the 1 time I ate at the sushi bar in the hotel. I had 2 plates of sushi samples (10 pieces), 1 piece of sashimi, and 2 beers. Cost $180. Let me just say. The hotel is nice. The staff is very attentive. The free breakfast in the morning is good, but since it starts at 7 am makes it too late for me to use every day. I wish they opened it up at 6:30 or even better, 6 am. And now they have in-room cell phones for patrons to use that give you free international calls and internet. That was handy. And I really appreciated the late check out - 2:30. But I won't be coming back anytime soon.For me, a good night's sleep is the most important thing. And I did not get that there. Which totally surprises me because this is by far the most expensive hotel I stayed at while I was in Tokyo but had the worst air conditioning. I did see a letter from the hotel on the dresser asking us to pardon them for the noise while they remodel the rooms. I can only say I hope they fix the damn air conditioning. It's the one thing stopping me from coming back.",,Y2003LXpeterb,19,3.0

I can see elements of my experiences here in the other posts. First is it's an easy option. You can book easily online, the executive lounge is a good option as it means food and drink on tap which makes life much easier. I think the hotel restaurants are expensive. Catching the airport bus from Narita is very easy, happy smiling English speaking folks will sell you a ticket to the TCAT, buses run to the minute, English speaking folks will check your ticket and get you on the right bus. There is a discount for foreigners.The TCAT is right next door to the hotel. Note return bus is caught from level 3 which seems odd until you are used to it. Timetables and prices all online. I quite like the old grandeur of the lobby, they just need more places to sit. Check in, well UK flights can arrive in the morning well before the 3pm time, I've had mixed success in an earlier time, it's not a given. This trip I had to pay for the extra hour to check in at 2pm which seemed a bit stiff given how many times I've stayed there before.Rooms are a bit old, but to be honest doesn't worry me, pillows and mattress definitely ""firm"" rooms are accessed by a large conventional key, I was sad to learn that will be changed soon, never had a key not work, but electronic ones many times.Road down from the hotel has many restaurants, and one can walk to some of the sights with good directions. It's a quiet area, I've never felt unsafe.I've walked to Akihabara a few times but it's quite a stroll.I'm sure there are better hotels, but this one is predictable and easy.

The Royal Park Hotel is old, I mean, you can call it charming if you like, but it’s an old hotel. We could hear toilets flushing, people sneezing, and people talking. We had 3 women staying in the room next to ours, and we listened to their conversation all night long  - They’re trying for sure, but I find it way too expensive for the exact same thing offered to you at the Cerulean. I could describe the state of the rooms and hotel in details, but I don’t want to be mean. I think it is listed as a luxury hotels because of the amenities it can provide. What one needs to know though, is that the pool and spa is supplement, so is breakfast…it wasn’t the case at the other luxurious hotel we stayed at. The staff is nice, the breakfast buffet is good, and its easy access to the subway is a plus.

For the convenience of not needing to wait up early, Travelling and stuck in the jam, I stayed here for 5 days. The evening I checked in, I was shocked by the key which they handed to me. I have not had a large heavy physical key for room from all these years of staying in any hotel. As mine is a business executive room, I have access to the executive rooms for breakfast and meetings. They issued coupons for each day for breakfast and check out time is 3 pm( which is great for me as my flight is. 5 pm ). This is great !

I also like the amenities for the room. Each is packed individually for hygiene reasons. Shower Cap, mouth wash, toothbrush and paste, a set of nail clippers, cotton buds and facial pads and nail filing board. There is a air purifier next to my bed. Hot water heater and bottles of water. The housekeeper came over the first day to hand me a pack of small bottles of facia Wash, toner and moisturer from the local high end ( elixir ) Shiseido ingredient brand With exception of the loud noise from the key opening door from neighbors, it is quite a quite floor for me .

If I need to change plans, I don't want to get hassled by the hotel staff about leaving a day early. I also like warm, friendly, and personal service. I also like a hotel where the facilities are well maintained and up-to-date.This is my company's ""preferred"" hotel, yet for the last two years I have been avoiding staying here due to my own personal preferences (and loyalty program). I had occasion to spend a night at this hotel--suffice it to say that I won't be changing my loyalty to the Royal Park for the following reasons:- The location is next to a major expressway intersection and close to Tokyo City Air Terminal (which used to be a useful place when you could actually check your bags and check in there). It isn't a pretty neighborhood and doesn't have much charm outside the entrance.- The lobby was probably state of the art when it was built--that time has long past--it is dated.- On the topic of warm, friendly, personal service--having spent a lot of time in Japan--it was very ""Japanese"" in its degree of feigned warm and very impersonal service. Typical of Japan's style retail and travel establishments, everything is formal and rigid--you won't get much in the way of casual pleasantries in the conversation (and yes I can do it in Japanese as well).- More than how I am treated, I have a hard time with the indignity of having the bellman wearing uniforms with a cap that reminds me of something you would see a monkey wearing with a organ grinder at an amusement park--sorry, not my thing.- One of the reasons I wanted to try out this hotel was I wanted to check out the pool as a way to exercise on my frequent visits to Tokyo. They wanted to charge an extra $20 for the pool, and add $10 to that if you also want to use the gym.- As I got out of one of the 3 out of the 4 elevators that was functioning, there was a very musty and stale smell in the long hallway as I walked to my room.- The hotel isn't allied with any of the other hotel chains where I have a loyalty program, so there won't be any points to be earned here.- I had a reservation for 2 nights and decided I didn't want to stay another night at this hotel. When I went to check out a day early, they told me that there would be an 80% fee to make this change--they wouldn't have said boo had I made a reservation that same day--I could have cancelled any time up until 6pm. To their credit, I refused to pay it and they capitulated. The excellence of Japanese customer service is limited to customers whose desires fit inside the established rules--go outside of those rules and you will pay (unless you make a stink).So I find zero charm or attraction to this hotel, there is nothing exceptional about the location, the facilities, the services, or the flexibility or friendliness of the staff--especially if you ask for an exception to their precious and all-important rules.","American Fork, Utah","RNClark</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>American Fork, Utah</strong>",22,1.0

The service, particularly the executive lounge, is outstanding. We will return.So why not 5 stars? Due to the timing of flights from UK you arrive in Japan early in the morning. With the efficient transfers from Haneda to the TCAT terminal we were at the hotel just after 9.00am. I fully understand the check in time is 14.00 and don't expect the room to be ready before this time. But as we often arrive in Asia at this time most hotels where we have booked an executive room, and in this case 6 nights, they will either offer the room for a sensible supplement if available or allow use of the executive lounge until the room becomes ready. We were charged the walk-in daily rate divided into 5 incremental hours which seemed excessive especially as we couldn't use the lounge either until 14.00. Given that the room was made up and empty and we had booked 6 nights surely the supplement charged should be the room rate we paid per night divided by the 5 additional hours or something sensible and notional.

I was also probably not making full use of the club benefits since I do not take alcohol.But back to the room, not sure if it's because it's on the executive level, the amount of complimentary amenities was mindblowing (see my attached photo). Besides the usual toiletries, there's even mouse rinse, hair brush, hair gel, hair tonic and even fabric freshener among the many other stuff!Wifi was very fast at something like at least 10Mbps upstream and down.

During room reservation, I had indicated early morning check in; but was denied a room. At Ritz Carlton Seoul, I was given a room upon check in at 9.00 am. That made a difference to this hotel. Having travelled long haul flight overnight, most guests were tired and needed a good rest to recuperate. But Royal Park was indifferent towards guest's needs at check in.This was the downside for those arriving Narita in early morning for check in at this hotel.The hotel is located only 2-3 minutes away from the TCAT (Tokyo City Air Terminal) for limousine bus to and from Narita. This made it very convenient to arrive and depart from airport-hotel-airport.The hotel is about 10 minutes taxi ride (JPY 1,000) from Tokyo Station for the Sinkansen or Metro.The room was clean. The bedroom was comfortable and quiet. I had quality sleep every night. I woke up fresh each morning for customer meetings.I enjoyed evening drinks with finger food (5-8 pm) and breakfast at the executive Lounge on the 20th floor.The view from the lounge offered a spectacular view of the city and its skyscrapers.The concierge staff were very friendly and polite when approached for assistance.I wish to put on record the excellent service level extended to me by Pagnozzi Paolo. I have asked for direction to TCAT the night before I checked out.He went above and beyond his duty to walk me personally to the TCAT and back. He even warned me that there would be heavy shower forecast the next morning during my check out. He advised me to take the covered walkway on 2nd Floor to the TCAT to avoid getting wet. Again, he went out of his way to escort and show me the way to TCAT.What Paolo did was an exemplary customer care. He is a true model for front line customer service. He is certainly a great asset to the service industry.Should there be a reward or recognition for staff high performance, Paolo Pagnozzi should be the prime candidate.Despite the downside at check in, Paolo has redeemed my faith in Royal Park Hotel.I shall certainly return as a guest again in my next visit to Tokyo.I recommend this hotel for business trips.",,Ps C,6,5.0

Unfortunately, the room key is an actual metal key, and there is only one key per room so you have to coordinate with whoever you're sharing the room with where you are going unless you want to be locked out.

But it was old in an old world charm kind of way where one can see that based on the decor and layout, the hotel had been around for quite a while, but everything was extremely well-maintained and still in tip-top condition.Second, I need to mention the location of the hotel - it's just perfect! I was a little apprehensive that the what looked like a non-central location, but everything worked out great. I was especially impressed with the hotel's direct connection to Suitengumae Station - basically, the moment you exit the fare gates and turn left, you are are the second level basement of the hotel. And not only that, the hotel's also directly connected to Tokyo City Air Terminal (T-CAT) on level 2, making getting to and from Narita Airport (55 minutes away) or Haneda Airport (25 minutes away) by the Airport Limousine Bus extremely convenient. The hotel had also thoughtfully arranged for special rates for international guests using the Airport Limousine Bus. Besides Suitengumae, the hotel was also within reasonable walking distance to Ningyocho and Hamacho Stations. Note that all these metro and subway stations were all non-JR for those relying on JR pass.The hotel's location was also pretty quiet despite it being near the hustle and bustle of Chuo City - good food was always nearby. It's also directly opposite 2 convenient stores, 7-Eleven and FamilyMart, which made grabbing that midnight bite all the more convenient. In all and all, I was honestly quite surprised that I liked this hotel's location far better than messy and noisy Shinjuku, where I stayed a week before my stay here.I stayed at the Deluxe Room which was very roomy by Japanese standards at about 42sqm. Wifi was fast, although it adopts one of the daily login kind of system that resets at midnight and so if you are doing any electronic transactional stuff over that period, do be aware of that.I booked the room without breakfast (I am late starter kinda of person and so find it a bother to wake up early for breakfast) and so is unable to comment on that, but the housekeeping quality was top-notch. The hotel's front desk also spoke excellent English which made communications a breeze.","Singapore, Singapore","RaymondWe2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",41,5.0

I asked them what a club room with a king bed would cost and she informed me it would be more than $100 more a night, which we declined;. We did take the twin room (no other alternative offered).

Service standards have definitely fallen - nobody even tried to help me with my luggage when I arrived (I didn’t need help, but there used to be 2 or 3 bell boys race over to offer assistance); when I checked out and commented that no English language newspaper had been left outside my room whereas there were Japanese newspapers for the other rooms, the reception staff just seemed to give a shrug of the shoulders. There’s no turn-down service offered in the rooms now, as there used to be. Small things, but overall give the impression of a hotel that’s lost it’s way a bit. This includes the food. I always used to enjoy the Symphony restaurant food and atmosphere. This visit’s meal was very mediocre in taste, service was no better than one gets in a Tokyo coffee shop, and the prices are ridiculously high compared with the market outside - JPY 1,050 + tax (USD 10) for a small (300ml) glass of draft beer (much of which is foam) - a 350ml can in 7-Eleven would cost JPY 210.The hotel still has the key advantage if being connected to the Tokyo City Air Terminal (TCAT) so if, like me, you had an early flight and needed to be on the limousine bus to the airport at 6:30am, then this might still be a worthwhile hotel choice.","Bournemouth, United Kingdom","Gemakan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bournemouth, United Kingdom</strong>",378,3.0

The rooms are not overly spacious but perfectly maintained. We were on business in Tokyo and for that Royal Park is perfect. The business lounge is on the 12th (?) floor, has magnificient views and is perfect for a quick business meeting , also breakfast is served here, although the selection, especially regarding Japanese fare, is limited when compared to the main restaurant on the ground floor. We did not have dinner in the hotel except for one night - be aware that the main restaurant closes at 22h. The hotel is situated next to the Tokyo City Air Terminal from which busses go to Narita airport, also T-CAT is a familiar location so Cabdrivers for once know what you're talking about. Still, do not leave the hotel without a their card detailing in Japanese the hotel name and location (and never, ever, try to get to a business meeting without the exact address and building name written down for you by the concierge in Japanese). Next, the Suitengu Metro station is basically below the hotel: thus very convenient access to public transport. As the metro system is (despite urban myth) easy to use and tickets are cheap (a 2$ ticket will take you across town basically) this really comes in handy! Next to the hotel is a 711 store which I believe is open 24h so groceries or a even a business shirt can be bought a step away from the hotel.

I liked the service. I fell and when I asked for ice (hoping to make an ice pack for my knee), they understood right away what I needed and brought me a real ice pack. They also have a lot of other things that make your stay comfortable (like 5 different pillows) and they bring them to your room very quickly. They have multiple (5?6?) restaurants in the hotel, but all look a bit expensive, but the one night I had to have room service, the food was very good. Reception and concierge staff were all pleasant and helpful.The subway stop they are on is not a main one so you will have to transfer to just about anywhere else, but the subway connects directly to the hotel.

I had to book 3 rooms as with a family of 5 Tokyo lacks hotels that will accomodate 3 people in a room.

Despite requesting adjoining rooms when booking, upon check in we were offered 3 rooms on various floors which I rejected as we had 3 kids with us. We were given 1 room 30 mins later but had to wait several hours for 2 further rooms (next door but not adjoining). We were not given any details about the executive lounge facilities until later that night which I was not impressed with. Breakfast in the lounge was just about acceptable but it was busy and choices very limited. Lunch downstairs was good but way way overpriced. Location was the best part of this hotel. Above the subway station it was easy to get around and the Italian Concierge was most helpful and I am sorry I cannot remember his name. He gave us an excellent itinerary of places to visit. Not sure this was alone a good enough reason to stay again frankly though. In parts it was fine but in others not good. Having 1 pair of jeans pressed for Yen 1000 was really over the top.

Don't worry about packing anything extra like lotion, robes, a brush, shaver or toothbrush/paste because they come supplied.For my first time in Japan, I did expect some more English but I understand I am in their country.

The hotel is also located directly above the Suitengumae metro station (B2 on the elevator floor selector gets you almost at the door step).

Great place to just show up and grab a coffee, tea, etc.The service staff are very attentive and were helpful in all respect of our stay. They spoke excellent English and were able to make/confirm some of our requested dinner reservations. They were very responsive to difficulties (i.e. locked key in room). The room was a very large Executive Room with two double beds, a closet, a vanity area, in room bar/coffee service with complementary bottled water everyday, large desk, separate sitting area, audio/video, free Wi Fi (in room and in Executive lounge), typical small bathroom (with heated toilet seat). Very comfortable classic room for a very good price.There are many food options in this hotel, from a lounge bar, to a cafeteria style dinning venue, to Chinese, to Italian, to Japanese. We only dinned in once, but it was quite expensive for what your got - high quality, but small quantity. Taking the 2nd floor Sky Bridge over to TCAT provides more options, including McD's for families and a 7 /11 directly across the street. I also favor a little noodle house that is the first thing you come to as you exit the front of the hotel and turn right onto the main street - been here for ever. Walking further up the main street toward Tokyo downtown finds many, many shops and more restaurants, both on the main street and the smaller side streets - all very safe.

The hotel is classically designed, the decor is more elegant but when you check into the room, the technological add-on's are complimented to suit the new age traveler.The staff was very professional, spoke English well and very knowledgeable about places to visit. The path to the closest subway stop is directly underneath the hotel so it is convenient especially if you are traveling with children. You can buy daily or weekly passes from the front desk for the trains, which are the same price as the ticket office so it is convenient.The in room dining was excellent, good food if you are out all day and need to just stay in for a meal before going to sleep. They even have an in room massage option if you like such amenities, i did not use it but good to know nonetheless.The location is close to most of the happening areas, Ginza is not very far from the hotel i would think a 10 minute drive. Rappongi street seemed further away but then again there was traffic in the evening.The Wi Fi was fast enough (I cannot remember if it was paid or free), but i was not in the room long enough as Tokyo has a lot of sights to see! There is a 7 eleven right across the hotel for those who need to buy some food/snacks and not spend too much on in room dining, although i found the prices were reasonable. The room was quite big, i had a twin bed room which was quite large. I think a king size or Queen size bed in one room should be spacious enough if you're traveling alone. Restaurants - i did not try the other restaurants in the hotel but i did visit the Royal Scots bar which seemed to be popular with the upmarket crowd and business people. There were quite a few people there in the evening, the bar was more of a quiet lounge , food was good so you can enjoy a meal there as well.

The hotel's focus is on Asian and European travelers which appeals to us as it's a refreshing change of pace; most of the staff does speak English though. The Executive Floors are desirable as the rooms are larger and there's access to a superb breakfast as well as cocktail hour. Our room was quiet, comfortable (king bed), and warm with a welcome humidifier (winters can be dry). Yes, the room keys are large and the decor is Tokyo-modern from days past but to us that's all part of its charm. The hotel sits atop the Suitengumae Metro (Hanzomon Line) and is adjacent to the Tokyo Central Air Terminal (TCAT) thus making it the first stop from Narita on the bus (after the flight and the 50 minutes from Narita we don't want to spend yet another hour or crawling across town just to get to the hotel). We especially enjoy the environs which, unlike much of the more well-known parts of the city, is not a concrete canyon or Times Square redux but an area that rewards repeated exploration on foot. But above all it's the staff and service that keeps us coming back. Everyone: front desk and lobby employees, executive lounge staff, housekeeping, laundry, are 5-star in their comportment and responsiveness. By the time we left we truly felt we had been pampered, even spoiled by their attentiveness and care in all details.

Outside of Narita baggage claim is TCAT ticket and the bus is right outside. Royal Park is the only hotel that is connected to TCAT. 2) Tokyo Access. Below the hotel is the Hanzomon subway line by Tokyo Metro. You can buy a 2 day pass at the hotel to use on this line ($9 for two days). I hate switching subway or moving to the JR Rail on the ground level, it can be crazy and getting lost is not good, so you can use this ONE line to get to 4 places you should visit in Tokyo - Shibuya, Ginza, Nihonbashi (visit the new COREDO buildings) and Tokyo Sky Tree. They are all on this ONE line and you can catch an elevator from your room floor directly to the station. That is convenient, and non-Japanese will be able to move around. 3) Other - all staff speak English and service is impeccable. Make sure you try to eat dinner at Sumida Teppanyaki on the 21st level with commanding night views of Tokyo Sky Tree and Tokyo Tower. The meals start at $120 per person, but they have a course dinner for hotel guests only that is $55. Highly recommended. Bring you running shoes too, next the hotel is the Sumida River and there is an amazing jogging path that runs on both sides. This place is the ideal location in Japan for non-Japanese.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Toby_Tamaye</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",7,5.0

I attended a convention at the Tokyo International Forum and Imperial Hotel. First off, getting there from Haneda airport was a breeze because the hotel is right beside the TCAT where bus limousine makes a major stop. Also there is a major subway station directly connected to the hotel (Hanzomon Line via Suitengumae Stn). I have to walk about 10 minutes to the nearest subway line to take me directly to the convention centre (Hibiya line via Ningyocyo Stn). Going back to Haneda via bus limousine was also a breeze. Since it is directly connected to a main subway station, going around Tokyo was easy for sight seeing. Room was small as well as the bathroom. TV channels are limited. Nevertheless, stay was pleasant and we expected Tokyo hotels to be small. I would not mind staying in this hotel again. Food was expensive in the hotel but there are several Ramen restaurants, 7-11 and Family Mart in the area.

The hotel restaurants are quite good, if more than a bit pricey, although the coffee shop in the lobby was good, and pretty reasonable for Tokyo. Would definitely stay again, but would avoid the 'sunny side' of the hotel next time.","San Francisco, California","kevinish</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",72,4.0

The Royal Park has many local restaurants of all types within a short walking distance - the guest rooms start at about level 6 in the hotel - so they are generally well away from the city traffic noise.I have been visiting the hotel for the past 8 years or so and although there have been some changes it still maintains its standards - comfortable beds, clean spacious rooms and especially important, quiet efficient airconditionning systems to help provide an undisturbed sleep.Both wired and wireless internet connection is available and it has worked to my complete satisfaction.I norrmally stay in the executive rooms but have in the past used the standard rooms - both are confortable but the access to 20th floor executive lounge (especially during the early evening cocktail hours) and for breakfast is worth the extra cost.Also the ability to easily extend one's stay to a 3pm late check out can at times be useful depending on your onward travel plans.I ceratinly recommend the hotel.","Cirencester, United Kingdom","qaman90</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cirencester, United Kingdom</strong>",6,5.0

Other than one minor negative that I describe in my review, I will definitely stay at the RPH during my next business trips to Tokyo. Location - Four points worth noting regarding the RPH's location: 1) If I was lucky enough to catch all ""green"" crosswalk signals, I could be at my office in 5 minutes, and no longer than 10 minutes otherwise. 2) The TCAT (Tokyo City Air Terminal - http://www.tcat-hakozaki.co.jp/eng/index.html) is the bus service that links Tokyo's two main airports (Haneda and Narita) to the Nihombashi district, and it's literally right next door to the hotel. I flew in and out of Narita, and door to door was about 1 hour. 3) You can access the Tokyo subway from the hotel lobby by going down the escalators to the platform. 4) Taxis are always on the ready outside the hotel's main doors. Cleanliness - They are maniacally focused on many things at this hotel, and cleanliness is at the top of that list. Guest Room - I stayed in room 614 which had two twin beds, workspace, and bathroom. This room faced East and overlooked a number of elevated highway ramps, but the traffic noise was non existent, and I slept soundly on the very comfortable bed. While the entire room was spotless, the bathroom pretty much needed gutted and replaced. Everything was circa early 90's w the commode being some kind of hybrid of sorts that included a bidet, and the tub was somewhat raised which meant that the shower head was placed at a height suitable for someone 5'6"" - 5'7"". All things considered, I chose not to dwell on the negative aspects of the bathroom, but wanted others to be aware of what to expect in this particular room class of service.Restaurant - I'm not sure if this was a promotion or a standard offer, but all restaurant meals were 20% off for staying guests. Previous to this stay, I rated the breakfast at the Athens Hilton to be the gold standard by which all others are measured. Well, the Royal Park is now the new gold standard for their outstanding service, selection, quality, and taste. I also had a great dinner in the restaurant, and the only negative would be the high price, even w the 20% discount. That said however, few things in Tokyo can be considered a bargain, so I'll chalk this minor point up to location.Staff - Outstanding in every aspect, and spoke excellent English.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","jefftrbo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</strong>",24,4.0

The hotel is very well appointed and the staff were extremely helpful. In most cases the staff could speak English, if not; they always managed to find someone to who could. There were a number of restaurants which catered for a diverse range of tastes. The Japanese restaurant was great although slightly overpriced for my liking (averaging at £90 per head). The bedrooms where very well laid out and the bed was very comfortable. If you book to stay in the executive rooms you get access to the Executive Lounge where they serve breakfast, snacks throughout the day, and evening cocktails. The cocktails were DIY as long as you could decipher the Japanese recipe book provided :o) . The snacks were excellent and prepared fresh throughout the evening. The Executive Lounge also boasted a fantastic view of the surrounding skyline, worth a visit!!. I only have a couple of gripes!! – Firstly, for the room price I would expect bottled water and coffee making facilities to be available in the room. Both were provided but only on a chargeable (mini bar basis). Secondly, the air-conditioning in the room was extremely inefficient. The lowest setting was 18 Degrees (C). At night it could just about cope, but during the day with the winters sun shining the air-conditioning seemed to pack up. On a number of occasions we had to leave our room and wander down to the lobby to cool off.

Yes there are some issues. As reported earlier, making half the floors executive floors means overload on the executive services, delay checking in ( I had to wait 15 mins), and delay in breakfast. A recent decision has been to abolish the Executive Lounge on the 18th floor and relocate it to the rooftop 20th floor. I do not see the logic for this, there is not much more space, tho' better view, but breakfast is as crowded as ever, and there is no rooftop bar in the evening. Also you are checking out in the midst of a throng of people having breakfast! The bar was a real selling point, great nightime view, busy, always, and sitting in the lobby, last orders 10.30, with a large TV is hardly the same. Also breakfast on the 20th floor has last orders at 08.30, which is unheard of in my 40 year experience of business hotels.I usually have a deluxe room, which is large, like a junior suite and really good value. Some of the floors are a bit tired, true, but they are clean, beds comfortable, and everything works. Electronic aircon means you can cool your room down to 18deg, which is great. Great array of free bathroom kits, as ever. Laundry etc efficient and chaep, about 25% of the NY hotel I recntly stayed in. Free use of gym, pool etc, which is good.

Stayed in room with Executive Club privileges. Room was clean and larger by Japan standards, but was unchanged since many years ago, is ""tired and worn"", and in need of being refurbished. Even had an ""old and musty"" smell. New Executive Lounge recently opened in September, very nicely done. Western breakfast in the morning had limited choices, but good quality. Disappointed when I hosted a business associate in the lounge for a brief morning meeting. He only wanted a cup of tea, for which I had to pay the ""visitor"" fee of 2300 yen. No accommodation at all by the hostess, said the charge was necessary regardless of whatever he had. A bit ridiculous to pay $23 for 1 cup of tea, even by Japan standards, and the lack of flexibility was not at all what I would expect from a ""luxury"" hotel. Otherwise, service is good, staff is very friendly and English-speaking skills have improved signficantly since I was last here.

This time I could not because I was on the phone with a rather impatient corporate travel agent that basically told me I should have better preparation before booking a hotel, in the end, I let the agent make the decision for me which was not the most intelligent thing to do. This time I got to stay at The Royal Park Hotel in Tokyo. It was located in an area called Nihombashi, which is an area where commerce in Tokyo first started. You get to see many traditional shops, but the area is so quiet, and the only thing that keeps it going is the many little eateries that dot the street. The hotel is located next to the TCAT where the airport city shuttle buses dock. A great plus especially tired after a long flight. It is also just next to the subway, which is a plus since the place is so isolated you don’t get overwhelmed with the intricacies of the Japan subway system.The hotel room, though super old, is well kept and clean. It is still using a traditional lock and key, which is so heavy! They gave a little sachet to ladies who check into the hotel, which consist of a facial cleansing set. A smart move that got me buying the product later at the shops. I particularly like the toiletries in the bathroom, you could almost not pack a toiletry bag, as they had everything including mouth wash and nail clipper. The bathtub though old but well maintained boasts the best water pressure I have experienced for old hotels. Perhaps because the Japanese love to have their bath soaks. I suppose this hotel is a great location for those who have a short stay and want to be away from the hustle of major Tokyo spots. One had to literally take a train to each popular destination, but it was not so difficult getting around. I must say this hotel has great breakfasts of both international and Japanese cuisine.

By now though, I didn't allow that to cloud my initial perception that this was an older hotel which probably had its days of grandeur many days ago. My room was pretty tight and the furnishings were all very 90s. That said though, there was nothing wrong with it at all if you were OK with dates designs. The room was very clean and everything was laid out in a very logical manner. The toilet, though old school, had nice soap/shampoos and there was also a handy kit comprising of a comb, nail filer, nail clipper, Band-Aid, sewing kit. It was these little details around the room which made me appreciate the simple luxury that many swanky hotels tend to miss nowadays. The hotel is situated right by Tokyo City Air Terminal and you can take a bus to/from Haneda and Narita for ¥3000 or less, making this location very ideal.

Needless to say, its proximity was not worth it. The property should be avoided. Above all, the worst thing about this hotel is the air conditioning (if you can even call it that). I had it set to the lowest possible temperature and it was still hot - there is no way to control the fan's speed as well. If there was such a thing as an ""extra low"" setting, this was the unit was set to. I couldn't sleep at night and they didn't even have a fan to give me. Furthermore, the window doesn't open (not that this would help much). This can be unbearable in the heat of Tokyo's summer (33+). There were other issues as well. I was booked into a room with a double bed and they tried to tell me that I actually booked a room with two single beds. I had to argue with the front desk staff and have my travel company call them (because I didn't have a confirmation printed out, which they insisted I provide them). Eventually, I decided to switch hotels. I told them I was checking out early and, again, they put up a fuss by saying that I couldn't! I told them my rate allowed me to do so and, after getting into a lengthy discussion with the manager, I was finally allowed to leave. I moved to the ANA Intercontinental, which is a FAR better property and even had a lower corporate rate (at that point, I didn't care that I would have a 27 min commute to my office).Some other thoughts:Location - It is easily accessible via an attached metro station and a bus terminal with direct links to Narita. There isn't much else in the area except for a few restaurants, many of which are closed on the weekends, and mini-marts. There is a Starbucks about 10 min walk away. There are great areas of Tokyo, but this one doesn't showcase the city well.Service - Per my above complaints, I wasn't that impressed with the service. The staff's English was okay to poor. Food - I ordered room service once. It wasn't good and I never tried it again. Rooms / property - They are small and clean. What you would expect from a 3 star hotel. Oddly enough, your key into the room is a skelton key. It may sound quaint, but I found it annoying to carry around. In general, the best way to describe the property is that it looks like something out of the early 90s. Other points - The Internet is free (wireless and wired) and works well.I am sure you won't be surprised that I won't stay at this hotel again. Tokyo is a great place, with many different properties to stay at. I don't see any reason why this one should be considered. I travel a lot for business and I can't understand why there are so many good reviews.","New York City, New York","legacytraveler1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",90,2.0

I used to stay here as a rule but the price became a little too high when the US dollar bottomed out against the Japanese yen. Now that it has recovered substantially, I am once again in a position to stay here a little more often. The location is terrific as it right next door to TCAT, a common destination for buses from Narita (about 50 - 60 minutes) and Haneda (about 20 - 25 minutes). It also allows access to the Suitengumae Metro station directly from the lower level of the hotel. For the price you pay, the accommodations are quite good, the service is excellent and the breakfast buffet is top notch. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The facilities are a bit on the older side but they are very well kept. The staff are extremely polite and efficient. Use of English is never a problem. The concierge is always helpful when you need directions on somewhere to go or how to get about on the train or subway. That was reinforced on my recent stay as the advice I received was quite useful. The price is still a little high but it is very reasonable when considering prices in general in Tokyo.

The airport bus terminus was located in the adjacent building complex and and metros stations within 250 meters from the hotel. The service was fantastic, reminded me of Taj quality of service. The sleep quality, the upkeep...was exceptional. Highly recommended place. However from cost point view, Japan is very expensive, because of their weak currency!!!About Tokyo...Distance from Airport to hotel via airport shuttle bus( Which is frequently available outside airport terminus, for which the ticket needs to be collected near the exit gates) was about 45 mins. Though Tokyo was more a commercial district, the strange thing that i noticed was, it was a young crowd all over, old people were usually found near temples.Coming to Metro, one thing that every visitor needs to experience, the metro during peak hours. There is a dedicated guard with white gloves on, just to stuff people in. Be ready to be completely sandwiched!!!!! would highly recommend this hotel and Japan to any traveller who is looking towards eastern part of the globe.When in Japan, you need to try the Shinkansen or the Bullet train...The routes that we tries was Tokyo to Osaka and Hiroshima...Amazing feeling....a life time experience..",Bangalore,"Kishan77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangalore</strong>",85,5.0

Vegetarian or non-vegetarian, you can sure have a breakfast with a vengeance and then some, in the form of countless deserts, fruit choices and juices.

For 26,000 yen, we get a twin room - two nice sized beds, not the best quality beds, but decent - plus breakfast buffet which is high quality - offers both Japanese and Western (this type of thing would be 2,000-3,000yen per person in Japan), and free access to the indoor pool, gym, and sauna. Now in the US, FREE access to the pool/gym is a given, but in Japan, most hotels charge 1,000-3,000yen for access. So this is why I've come to appreciate the value at Royal Park. They don't charge you extra for things that are usually charged extra at other hotels (even at Western hotels like The Ritz in Osaka). Also, we always get rooms on the Executive Floor which gives us free access to drinks and a printer and there is a dedicated concierge there that speaks fluent English. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is connected to T-CAT (Tokyo City Air Terminal) where you get direct access to Haneda and Narita airport by bus.

Nice view, but the location of the Orpheus windows do not have spectacular skyline of skyscrapers (like at Park Hyatt or Dai Ichi hotels)Genjiiko Japanese Restaurant: I tried the low cost menu (around 5200JPY) and found a miserable food quality. They created a very nice Japanese garden. with pond and trees: the view is definitely nice.YANONE SUSHI restaurant (basement): excellent sushi bar -with hotel price, but great, cheerful service and excellent taste. This seems to me the best restaurant of the hotel, for quality/price ratio.Overall: I'll definitely come back.

Room is spacious as we got ourselves a room on the executive floors. We have 2 little toddlers and the room is spacious for the 4 of us. Because of time constraint we did not get to visit the executive lounge on the 20th floor, but totally enjoyed the great breakfast buffet spread on the 1st floor of the hotel, the buffet spread is just wonderful even if you are a picky eater, you can surely find something to satisfy yourself to kick start the day with. Love love love the buffet ! This brought me to start comparing Sheraton Grande Tokyo Bay hotel's buffet which is quite a disappointment if you compare with Royal Park Hotel ! 2 thumbs up to Royal Park Hotel's buffet breakfast spread !! The thoughtfulness and kindness rendered by the staff in the hotel is indeed great to begin with. From the little fine gesture like placing a card beside the bed every night telling us what the weather would be the next day is very thoughtful and sweet ! The toiletries in the bathroom is almost perfect ! You could literally go to this hotel without your bathroom toiletries ...from the basic like soap, shampoo, shower cap, tooth brushes etc...They even provide hair products like hair tonic and hair moisturizing products ! The hotel staff are always helpful and their ability to communicate in English is really useful to foreigners who don't speak Japanese.Location of the hotel is great as it is just above the train station but if you have little kids who cannot walk a fair distance, by all means bring an umbrella stroller with you, get something cheap and that you won't feel the pinch even when you have to throw it away if it gives way.There are quite a good number of convenient stores just opposite the hotel main entrance as well as a supermarket just less than 5 minutes walk away. If you need some seasonal fruits there is also a fruit store just opposite the supermarket. A couple of drug stores are also near by, great place to get the Japanese made beauty products. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a comfortable stay and we would surely be going back to this hotel again on our next trip!

This was my first time at this hotel and was selected because it's right next door to TCAT, the Tokyo City Airport Terminal. But notwithstanding this proximity, it wasn't as straightforward as one might expect to find the hotel. Signage is sparse and they direct you out onto the street with an arrow to turn right. Once I was out there and turned right, I came to the road but still no idea where the hotel was?As it turned out, I crossed the road and after walking up and down for a few minutes, I saw the entrance to what looked like a hotel. As i approached, I asked the doorman there if this was the Royal Park Hotel and he pointed to his cap with the hotel name on it.Why is it that the hotels I've been staying in in Tokyo seem so old and in need of refurbishment? Am I not looking in the right places?I have no issue with the srvice, as with every place in Japan, even YHA's, minchuku's and ryokans, the service is always excellent! It's just the hotel rooms and decor that feel as if they're from a bygone era.They are fairly pricey too but of course, this is comparative and i'm comparing it to my last hotel in Seoul so perhaps that's an unfair comparison.When checking in, they asked if I'd like an upgraded room for an extra 6000JPY and while I was tryign to recall how much that was, I was so tired after travelling there, I accepted this. Getting to my room, it had a couple of single beds but veyr basic furniture and little space to place my suitcase but this was the same in my previous hotel in Tokyo a couple of months before.My photos will describe it better but basically, the design of the room was dated and there wasn't a lot of room, even if only for a three night stay.Breakfast was fine and the restaurant had a wide range of choices and was attractively laid out. I particularly enjoyed the grapefruit juice there and the bacon was thin and crispy.The door key was a big heavy brass key with the room number on it which in many othrer hotels, would be frowned upon as beign perceivedto be a security risk if you lost the key but I guess because they're so honest in Japan, a sense of style overcame this!The lounge on the 24th floor was OK but the tables were so close together that you could easily read the newspaper of tgeh guest sitting next to you!The staff there were friendly and helpful though as is typical of the Japanese. There are a couple of PC's next to the reception desk in the lounge and I used this to print out a document but hten had to go to the ground floor to have it scanned following signing it. Why don;t theyhave a scanner in the lounge?

We booked an executive floor room with executive lounge access. The lounge facilities were adequate with coffee, tea assorted biscuits and pastries. Our ""non-smoking"" room did smell of cigarette smoke on the first few nights(I am an ex smoker and have finely tuned nostrils!)and luckily the smell disappeared when we became accustomed to it?The room 1650 was a little bit worn with tea or coffee stains on the light shade, curtains and celling. No obvious air extraction from the bathroom along with staining of bathroom tiles from dampness. If the room was updated or given 1 days worth of TLC by RPH it would be fantastic.Cleaning and general tidying by the hotel staff was very good.Executive breakfast on floor 20 was a failure in my eyes. The variety of food was minimal compared to the wide range of food on ground level. The area was quite small and became crowded,I felt as if I were fighting and rushed to fill my plate. We only spent one morning eating breakfast there.There were a few restaurants on-site and they were VERY pricey, the exception to this rule was the restaurant on the ground floor (where you eat breakfast).Direct access to the hotel can be via Tokyo Metro station ""Suitengumae"" exit 4 which is located in the Chuo Ward of Tokyo and is served by the Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line. The location is perfect for access to the whole of Tokyo, just buy the metro 1 or 2 day pass and go explore!

Don't take a cab into town...it costs way too much. The coach to the city air terminal was perfect. The local area around the hotel has temples, stalls, and little eateries for lunch...a short metro ride gets you everywhere else...and the metro is in Japanese and English, and the staff are super-helpful. Also this hotel is literally on top of a metro stop. The hotel is a classical, grand, old style business hotel. We stayed on the executive floor, so the bedrooms were pretty big (mini suites), with lots of extras thrown in for free. Wifi and water in the room is complimentary but why the tea, coffee and mini bar cost when I can wander down to the executive lounge and get them for free is beyond me! Free drinks at 5-8 pm allows for a G&T before going out for dinner, and the views from the top are great. Breakfast is also free on the exec floor but pricey if you're in a regular room. We ate Tapanake on the 20th the first night (great views as the chef prepares the food), and went out for dinner the rest of the time. As a 5 star, business hotel this place cannot be faulted. It is classical/old fashioned in styling, so don't expect super modern furnishings.

Better than the Narita train which arrives at Tokyo station and unless you are staying in a hotel right near the station you must take a taxi from there to your hotel. Also, this hotel connects to one of the Tokyo subway lines on the B2 level, so you can take the elevator to the subway. Don't be afraid of the subway.

We were treated like royalty by the staff from the minute we walked in the door until the minute we left. Everyone was so gracious, pleasant and overly accommodating.We had read on Trip Advisor about the proximity of this hotel to transportation. This was paramount for us because we wanted to see several parts of Tokyo. So knowing that there was a subway underneath the building and a couple other subway lines 2-3 blocks away, we were just where we wanted to be...5 - 10 minutes from everything. We considered staying in the Roppongi area, but after we visited Roppongi, we were glad that we chose our hotel, and stayed where we were! Roppongi was very touristy - nice to visit for dinner or for the day, but we preferred where we stayed at the Royal Park, which was 10 minutes from Roppongi and 5 minutes from Ginza, the hot shopping area! TCAT is the bus terminal. From Narita Airport, we took the Airport Limosine Bus just one stop to TCAT. Royal Park was next door. We hopped off the bus, and there was a telephone in the lobby of the bus station for Royal Park Hotel. We picked up the phone which rang the hotel, and within a few seconds, a porter/bellman was running over with a cart to get our bags. We didn't know how close we were, because we could have walked over on our own, but it was a nice way to welcome us.After we entered the hotel, we were seated at the Woman's Traveler Desk. I guess it's to assist female travelers? I don't know, but we were greeted by a wonderful woman who assisted us and checked us in to our beautiful room.Typically, I don't eat in hotels. I like to be fully immersed in the area I'm visiting, so I eat elsewhere, but the night we checked in, we were exhausted after a 12 hour flight, and headed upstairs to one of the 6 restaurants in the hotel. We went to the one where the chef prepared the meal in front of us. It was phenomenal, and a great view of the city from the 20th floor. Outside the hotel, we found several quaint restaurants where we had terrific sushi, noodles and rice.To us, this place was perfect in every way. We felt comfortable, and welcomed. Our room was beautiful and the staff was amazing. The location was superb because we could be anywhere in Tokyo that we needed to be, within minutes. For those who want options, this is where you need to be!This hotel is great for friends exploring Tokyo, and also would be great for business travelers, especially women who are traveling alone.

For example, concierge staff were very helpful in providing useful tips for sight-seeing, directions and some other occasions. Information such as subway route map and the city map of Tokyo was handy. You can also ask for a rate table that shows the approximate taxi fares to a number of destinations within the city.If taxi is not an option, the basement of the hotel connects to the Suitengumae subway station.

Although hotel is ready for a reburb now and probably has been for the last 5 years or so.

Great little snacks (the first few that come out) but which then get a bit ropey as the evening goes on and the selection of alcoholic drinks/wines is limited.

But the surrounding area was pretty interesting itself - has a few small temples/shrines that are worth a visit, just not too many restuarants for dinner in the evenings.

This hotel has incredible service, and the facilities are excellent.Just a quick anecdote on why the service here is the best. On the first day of my stay, I had just checked in at 3:00pm and one of the cleaning maids made a mistake to open the room door for a spot of cleaning (she did knock on the door and press the doorbell first, but I was slow in responding). She was mortified that a guest was still in the room. She said her sorrys and I accepted her apologies. However, the management called me 15 minutes later in the room and offered her apologies. When I checked out 5 days later, the concierge again apologized for the incident again showing the level of detail they go into to ensure guests are welcomed and that their stay is out of this world.Pros.1. Excellent location - there are lots of local restaurants and shops around and is right on top of Hanzomon Metro line.2. Service is out of this world. Room amenities are very well thought out. Everything you need is in the room, it even has a Nexpresso machine for your coffee.3. Complimentary Internet line and WIFI (speed was never an issue, youtube videos were fine)4. Breakfast buffet is excellent with a great choice (go to the Level 1 buffet, the L16 one has a smaller selection)5. Pool and Gym is perfectly adequate if you need it for fitness (but it would be nice if they could open beyond 9pm)6. Late check out (3pm). Cons1. The room view (I was on 12th floor) is nothing to write home about.2. The selection of TV channels does not have a great selection for non Japanese.The hotel is excellent if you want a hotel with a Japanese character for a business stay. I have stayed at the Shangri-la hotel in Chuo-ku and while it too was a stunning stay with excellent service, it has a very sterilized western feel. If you want to experience abit more of the Japanese culture, then Royal Park Hotel is an excellent choice (plus it was about 60% of the price of a Shangri-la room)","Hong Kong, China","Thylacine13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",0,5.0

I'll let the facts speak for themselves.I was stuck with it. Having stayed at the Hilton before in Shinjuku and knowing what level of service there to expect, I dreaded staying at another hotel, regardless of the travel agents promise of the ""Luxury Rating"" An experienced traveler knows better.The Friendly airport limousine (It's a bus folks, not a classic limo in the real sense) drops you off at the Tokyo Air Terminal (TCAT for short) It's a bus terminal, nothing more, with a few shops. Although the Royal Park is next door, signage is non-existent, and you cannot see the property from the drop off point. I knew it was there from reading Tripadvisor reviews, so I asked the Security guard for directions. and rolled the luggage across the street in the rain.The lobby is sumptuous and Grand. It gave the impression of luxury, wide spacious and full of light and restaurants.Every staff member smiled at you and was eager to serve or help.I was checked in quickly and a staff member assisted me to my room. I had asked for a king or queen bed, but none were available and had two double beds. Small disappointment but it had happened before.It was curious to note that the Hotel still uses Brass Keys, no electronic locks for the guest room doors. It's a big key, so have a big pocket to carry the key in or drop it off at the front desk when you leave.The elevators taking you to your room are quick and efficient.The hallways of the guest room floors were very clean and had quiet music playing.And then I arrived at my room....The standard guest room is small folks. Not a surprise, as I had stayed in Japanese hotels before and expected this. What I didn't expect was the stained room carpets. Not one stain, but many stains. The carpet was clean, but the stains were permanent, a sign of very old, very used carpets long past replacement phase. The TV was all Japanese language channels, a fact that evoked a sigh until I learned of the special remote control buttons that produced other channels with some English and other countries broadcasts.There was a mini bar in the room, which was good as they didn't provide ANY free water bottles, not even initial ones. As usual for hotels, mini bar prices were exorbitantly high.The bathroom had a very cheap and flimsy curtain plus rod, the kind attached via pressure against the walls type. It was not permanently installed. The shower nozzle was attached to the faucet via a cord, as some European Hotels are wont to do. That would have been fine, except the cord length on this one was so short, my 6 foot 2 length required me to duck down and crouch to use the faucet head. I found myself laughing at the insanity of it all. The showers and bathrooms themselves were clean, however the very upper walls of the showers were covered in small dirt particles, as were the ceiling vents. As the housekeeping staff were consistently somewhat smaller in frame than the ceiling heights, this may have been unnoticed, but seriously needed attention. The toilet was very clean, but when flushed, produced a sharp briny odor, like sea water. It was fairly disgusting to inhale.That first night, I noticed the bed was comfortable, even tho narrow and short for my body length. And then, as I began to fall asleep, the bites started. No, not one or two little pinches, it was continuous, like a swarm. I had disturbed a nest, I think, or maybe the room was full of tiny flying insects. In any case, I spent the night in complete misery because of those little pinching bites, sleeping little. I tried a shower again during the night, thinking maybe it was my skin that was dry, but as soon as I came back to that bed it was nibble, nibble, nibble.The next day, I approached the hotel staff and complained of the bugs. They quickly offered a new room and at my request, on the same floor. I moved into the new room that same evening after a day at work. Same stained carpets and dirt on the upper shower walls, cheap shower rod, and faucet attached for a 4 foot high human being, but no bedbugs this time around. One night in the new room during a shower, the water went from warm to scalding hot. Be aware of this propensity in this hotel for this to happen.A word about the gym. The Hotel had a spa, which contained a large workout room. The charge for using the treadmills, as I desired. was 1500 Yen. This irked me royally, as every property I stayed at was a free offer for only jogging or free overall for the gym. I paid the first day, and was treated to a series of equipment that was old and faulty. The treadmills slipped during usage. I noted this to the staff, but they did nothing to provide a service recovery such as a complimentary refund. Not even a thank you for telling them of the breakage. The next day, I found that the property was very close to a multi kilometer jogging path along the river. This path was fantastic, fresh air, and had a breeze to die for in the evening. I used this path from then on rather than the Hotel gym.The hotel had several restaurants, very well designed and having a variety of food and drink. A complimentary drink and dinner special coupon was enclosed. Be aware that the dinner coupon does not exclude you from the Service Charge and Consumption Charge they tack on into your check. As the area has MANY fine eating establishments, I recommend highly eating outside the property for economy and variety.The Hotel is on top of the Hanzomon Subway line, accessible by elevator within the hotel. It's ultra convenient for transit anywhere in Tokyo.On my next to last day, I made use of the coffee shop for a take away cup. This was a major ordeal for some reason and took over 10 minutes to prepare an ordinary coffee in a cup. Once they had done so (and charged an appropriately high amount PLUS Service charge even tho the service was bad PLUS the Consumption charge) I walked away with my coffee and two small creamers. In my room, I added the creamers, noting as the cream fell into the coffee it was sour. Auuuuggghhh. I went back down to the coffee shop and produced the evil ruined coffee. Once again, no offer to recover or delight with customer service nor was there any apology for the bad coffee, just a much quicker replacement of the coffee and this time they used a cream pitcher with good creamer.Check out day was efficient and service at the desk was fine. The transport to the TCAT next door was again a walk across the street with luggage. At least it wasn't raining this time.In summary, I would not stay at this property again..ever, as the most disgusting occurrence to happen is being bitten by bedbugs. It didn't help matters that the few incidents that happened during my stay (the broken gym equipment which I had PAID to use and the sour coffee creamer which I PAID for) had no recovery in terms of delighting myself the customer or encouraging my future stays at the property. Perhaps they do not care about this or perhaps it isn't important to them. Overall I see a property that markets itself as ""Luxury"" but below the surface it needs serious upgrading of the rooms and service recovery related training to remain viable in a competition based market of hotels that already know these lessons.Like the Hilton does.",Southeast Florida,"VisitedNewPlaces</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southeast Florida</strong>",132,2.0

Of course, the price is hefty, particularly with the value of the yen vs. the dollar. But that is my sole complaint. I had altered our room arrangements when our daughter joined us and the hotel was very accommodating in changing our reservation to be sure to allow for a triple arrangement. They replied promptly by e-mail to all my questions prior to the trip and the concierge was terrific.

The staff were very friendly and the room itself (standard double on the executive floor) was spacious with a well appointed bathroom (I'm over 6"" tall and the bath was more than big enough for me). The hotel has a charming old-school feel to it, including plush, softly lit corridors and room keys that are actually keys (and weigh a ton). There was no street noise to speak of and free wifi on the executive floors was a definite plus.The hotel's not particularly close to any major attractions, but it's right above the Hanzomon metro line (Suitengumae station, which you can access directly from the basement) which makes it easy enough to get to anywhere in the city. Tokyo Station is also close by (about a 20 minute walk or 5 minutes by subway, but you have to change to the Marunouchi line).One thing to note, the hotel's booking conditions state that if a guest hasn't arrived by 8pm the hotel has the right to cancel the booking. I doubt they hold too firmly to this rule, but if you're going to be arriving late (as I was) it's worth emailing ahead to let them to know to hold the room.","Canberra, Australia","MattB83</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",9,5.0

TCAT's usefulness has varied over the years, with lows reached after 9/11 when some procedures were no longer handled there, but in the right circumstances it is extremely convenient, if check-in, luggage, and emigration formalities are all handled there (not all airlines are represented). This can mean the difference between enjoying one's last evening in Tokyo proper as opposed to a Narita airport hotel, for those with an early morning departure. TCAT is also right next to a freeway onramp, and traffic between it and Narita is broadly predictable, making the bus schedule quite reliable.This also means the hotel's vicinity is rather boring, with mostly offices and businesses around it. More lively areas are easily accessible by public transportation, though.The hotel is a solid operation, with quite acceptable rooms and service, obviously catering to a higher-than-average proportion of foreigners, especially from countries where taking the airport train with luggage is considered less dignified.

It was advertised as a 4 star hotel but I think it should be 5 stars. Everyone at the hotel was very attentive and friendly, especially the girls at the bell captains desk who helped us make reservations for a trip to Kyoto on the bullet train and get tickets to a Chuck Mangeoini Jazz Concert at the Cotton Club. We had a standard room (not on the executive floor) and it was very nice. 16th floor room with large window that overlooked a large section of the city. Wonderful toiletries in the bathroom. We thought the restaurant prices were high (breakfast was $23, dinner about $100 each) so we ate at neighborhood places, which was much cheaper. The location is wonderful, as the ""Friendly Airport Limousine Bus"" terminal is just next door. We took the bus directly from Narita to the station for about $28 each. The porter from the hotel came with a cart to get our luggage. (Use the Royal Park direct line from the bus lobby). The subway is directly under the hotel and we went all over Tokyo on the subway. The hotel sells 1 day passes cheaper than at the station. (about $6). For some cheap eats, McDonalds is in the bus terminal on the 2nd floor. The terminal is immaculate and so are the subways. Very easy to get around and explore Tokyo cheaply. For a great evening, take in a concert at the Cotton Club (near Tokyo station) or go walking in the Ginza area. Take the subway to Ginza. We also booked a 1 day tour on the bullet train to Kyoto (from Tokyo City tours) that included lunch for about $225 each. Great price as we found out that the train tickets (if you buy them yourselves) are more than $275 each. The tour price inluded a lovely lunch at the hotel adjoining the Kyoto train station.

However, it has great restaurants and feels a lot more relaxed and homely. You get the feeling you could be staying at a apartment because its not all glitzy and touristy.The nighttime cabs back from Shibuya will hurt your wallet though!Overall - Perfect comfortable stay. Nothing bad. Great service, always smiling, always willing to help and genuinely friendly.",Melbourne,"ArseneV</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",4,5.0

Outstanding service and accommodations!! Not a very cheap hotel but I wasn’t looking for cheap in Tokyo being an expensive city. I had a great experience with every staff person there and I commend them for such a stellar service they provide in order to make my stay the best experience. The HotelI don’t know about other reviewers saying that the hotel hallways were dark or the rooms seemed worn out a bit, I saw none of these things personally. The hotel hallways seemed adequately lit, very clean, my room was very well maintained with nothing worn out. The bathroom spacious enough, with plenty of toiletries available for me, plenty of hot water, and the famous modern Japanese toilet I was looking forward to being acquainted with, lol! (warm water spraying, bidet, warmed up seat, etc).My room (#1710 at the executive floors) had an independent climate control that I could easily regulate. The mini bar fridge was not working but I didn’t care as I never use the drinks in hotel rooms so that didn’t bother me. I loved the free and unlimited internet use, as well as the plenty of TV channels, Japanese and English language selection. the room was cleaned every morning at around 9a. A small detail I found priceless was that every day I found a small card placed on my nightstand with the next day's weather forecast to plan accordingly. I also received two complimentary newspapers every morning. Also, as another reviewer had mentioned, the windows are well sound proofed and my room also looked towards several highways and the Sumida river. I personally liked the view. The executive lounge (16th flr) was a great way to end my day. I would go there reading my newspaper alongside my drink. A great way to unwind from a busy day. The lounge has free food and drinks.(8p is last call for food and drinks though – kinda too early if you ask me). There are two staff people there at all times and they would be happy to assist you with any questions you have. The LocationI often hear from other reviewers saying that the hotel is out of the way. Out of the way of what?? Tokyo is so HUGE that everything and everyone is out of the way from each other, UNLESS you take the subway to reach your destination. The hotel is literally connected to the Suitengumae subway stop of the Hanzomon line. The second you get out of the train, you proceed to exit #4 and the hotel entrance is right there! How much easier can it get? It’s ridiculous!! Not to mention that you can buy a one-day train pass for the Tokyo Metro subway (Not the Toei subway line though) right at the hotel reception. It’s around 600 Yen. And most hot spots are just a few station stops away. So unless you are looking for the “Shibuya experience” of the famed pedestrian crossing intersection to be right as you exit your hotel, or the Ginza experience of having the ability to walk into a Luis Vuitton store right as you exit your hotel then you might need to look elsehwhere. In addition, I loved the neighborhood where the RPH is as I walked the streets up and down and saw the mixture of cute little shops (noodle shops, tiny toy stores, pastry shops, convenient stores, grocery stores, book stores, a Starbucks, etc) mixed in with office buildings. That’s what I like doing when I am in foreign places, to see how everyday is for the locals, office workers or otherwise and I could do it by walking the neighborhood which I found VERY safe even at night.The FoodThe hotel has many restaurants. I only tried the Symphony for its breakfast (nice selection) and the Hamada Sushi Restaurant for its sushi (excellent sushi). The rest seemed very expensive but I also didn’t have time to try them all being there for only a week. My suggestion would be to forget eating at the hotel restaurants every day as there are many little noodle shops (from 400 to 700 yen a plate) everywhere near the hotel and IMO that is the best way to eat and see where the locals go (who do not speak English whatsoever so venture out on your own risk, lol)The ServiceThe service at RPH was stellar, second to none! Any time I would approach the reception area for whatever questions, the staff was eager to help and make everything easy for me. Everyone had a smile on their face and very polite. The first day I arrived, I went to the reception to check-in and was immediately assisted with my luggage, was whisked to the Executive Lounge and shown to a table where I could eat and have a drink while the staff person was finalizing my check-in process.Final words, a great experience. Do not hesitate to stay at RPH hotel as it caters to every need, business or pleasure. Oh and if you choose to book a room at the executive floors, do not forget apply for a hotel membership in order to receive (and submit) the discount coupons to be applied towards your bill. Sorry for my long review, I hope you find it usefull. Thank you.","Boston, US","Amalia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, US</strong>",11,5.0

We knew the hotel was a little out of the way, but felt the access to the bus to to/from the airport and the fact that it was above the metro system was an advantage. Also like to get out and about in places that are not always in the centre of things. Hotel handy for shop accross the road for drinks snacks etc.We arrived very early (9.30am) and a room was not ready which we expected as the hotel was full from the night before, but the staff did all they could to find a room at the rate we had paid but none were clean,so we were offered a upgrade at a reducd rate to the club foor. We normally stay on the club foors but find ourselves increasingly cutting our day short to return for cocktails, and getting up for b/fast when really just want a little lie in, so on this occasion we just booked a normal room at a good price for Tokyo. We waited with a coffee for just under an hour for a room to be ready.Room quite a good size, a little worn in places and quite drab in decoration. But everything you needed including a safe (which is in the bedside cabinet). Comfy bed, ok linen but the bathroom was a little dated but clean, shower over bath which was very low to stand under, although the toilet was an laugh as everyone knows who has been to Tokyo. All the bits and bobs you need in the bathroom as far as shampoo etc. were there. Only real gripe was the amount and size of towels, but you could ring up for more.Room faced the expressway which was well soundproofed from the traffic, although could hear bathrooms a little from other rooms. Eventhough we were next to the lifts we never heard them.Access to a tv come pc in the room with internet access was good, but you do pay if you use the internt on your on pc, which was fair enough.Shops below the hotel handy as well. Did not have b/fast or use the bars but there was quite a selection of eating places in the hotel to choose from if needed.All in all we wanted a decent hotel at a fair price with easy acces to get around, which is what the Royal Park provided, if I was to go to Tokyo again, if the price was good we would stay again",United Kingdom,"Englandsscout</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United Kingdom</strong>",299,3.0

That hotel's rooms were modern and thoughtfully designed. The Royal Park's rooms were clean and also well thought out, but I had thought, nothing that special. More than adequate, but less than awesome.Chuo-ku is a vast district, which includes Ginza. The hotel however, is right on the fringe of the district. It is, as many other guests have mentioned, very close to the Tokyo City Air Terminal, which does help to minimize the pain of coming in from Narita. However, you're not exactly in a happening area either by staying here.I will say this - my wife is expecting in a few months, and I was delighted to find that there is a nearby temple that is dedicated to easy childbirths. I walked over there and threw in a few coins as an offering. I had evidently gone on a big day (maybe it's always that busy)!Service was good. I had taken the advice of others, as I didn't have any free meals, and ate elsewhere. As mentioned, there's a good ramen place just beyond the temple on the main road. But I think if you want to stay in a nifty district of Tokyo, one can probably be closer. On the other hand, you are right on top of a subway station so the connections are good during the day.","Hong Kong, China","David W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",230,4.0

After complaining, the desk staff reception who checked us in came up to the floor and apologize profusely. He also gave us a new room and transferred our bags.The breakfast buffet is ok. You get eggs, bacon, sausages, salmon, omelet, rice pilaf. The location is just ok, there is not much activity in the area but the hotel is connected to the subway station so you can easily go to any place you want. Ginza is 2 transfers away, so no problem there.The view we got from our room was not so good. If you look out the window, we see cars and an elevated expressway.

The rooms are clean, well-stocked with amenities, and, by Tokyo standards, quite spacious. The staff is exceedingly polite.I always opt for the Executive Floors, for four reasons:1. The Executive Lounge offers and excellent selection of snacks and beverages, and is a great way to unwind after work (trade show work in my case).2. The executive rooms have the USEN440 Satellite Radio. Now this is not a major thing, I know, but if you've never experienced Japanese Satellite Radio, you are in for a treat. You would be hard pressed to name a type of music that they haven't devoted a 24 hour station to, not to mention soundscapes, language lessons, and Auld Lang Syne (the Japanese signal that a place is closing).3. The breakfast buffet is included, and it's a good buffet. Certainly better than anything that passes for a breakfast buffet in the States.4. Free Internet. If you are like me, and have to check your email nearly constantly, then this is worth it. When you add the buffet and the Internet access to the mix, the price difference between the executive level and the other floors starts to look far less imposing.I recommend stepping outside and eating at one of the neighborhood restaurants for most of your meals. There is a good selection of restaurants nearby that cost much less than the ones in the hotel. If you want to go really cheap, there's a pretty good ramen place a few doors away that will only cost you around 700 Yen.The hotel is located in the Chuo-ku district, which puts it a little off the beaten path. If you are the kind of person who likes to step out the door into full Tokyo commotion, then this is not the hotel for you. The hotel is close to two of the major subway lines, so it is easy to get nearly anywhere from the hotel. One of these lines is directly under the hotel. The other is just a few blocks away.If you are a business traveler, and you find yourself stuck at hotels a lot, eating breakfast buffet food, and logging onto the computer at all hours, the Royal Park Hotel is a wonderful way to make a trip to Tokyo a lot less fatiguing.","San Francisco, CA","popvoid</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, CA</strong>",19,5.0

It's located in a more business district of Tokyo, but access to both metro and other train lines are walking distance. If you are looking to be in the middle of the scene, this is not the hotel for you. But if you want a nice base to explore Tokyo from, this is a solid choice.I was a little confused about the difference between the TAC (Tokyo Air Terminal) and Tokyo Central Train station. The TAC is a bus depot - it's attached to the RPH via a covered walk way. The busses to Narita are efficient (like every thing in Japan). However, if you take the train in from Narita, you will NOT arrive at the TAC, but rather at the Central Train Station. Its a 700 yen cab from the train station to the RPH.We were checked in promptly. I had requested a king/non-smoking room. The only one available was on the Executive Floor - so they kindly accommodated us. Except, they asked us not to use the executive lounge, which I thought was strange. The room was small (they had told us it would be at check-in) but for Japan hotels is was fine. Bed was comfortable. The bathroom mirror was heated so it never completely fogged up. The buffet downstairs has a huge selection of ""western"" food. Its pricey, but the food is good. ""Great Scott"" the basement bar is nice, quiet and a good spot for a drink if you arrive late.

It happened to be the first on my approved corporate list and I know why. To get there, I got off at Narita and walked up to the Airport Limousine desk and asked for the bus to Tokyo City Air Terminal (TCAT). 10 minutes later I was on the bus being offered tips by an returning ex-pat Japanese. Less than an hour later I arrived at TCAT, read the little map there (there's a direct-connect phone if you need help) walked around the corner and was in the hotel in 5 more minutes. The staff was gracious and I was whisked to the executive check-in. They got me a drink and checked me in while I relaxed. The ONLY thing that bothered me was that the girl who checked me in was adamant about taking my bag which was probably as heavy as she was. She refused a tip showed me the hotel room (which included a full computer, 200 channel cable radio including a station that plays ONLY the Rocky theme), free internet, nice desk, comfortable bed and the world-famous toilet seat in the pristine bathroom.The views from the top floors are great, I didn't eat in the restaurants, except for the included breakfast buffet, which is OK. However, there's a little dumpling place just down the street - take a right out of the hotel, go a block, look for the yellow standing sign on the sidewalk, excellent goyza dumplings - that I ate at several times. Several convenience stores around for late night / early morning drinks, rice balls, etc. made it ideal for me.Other than being mortified about a young lady carrying my bag, everything about my experience here was excellent.","Austin,TX","hnewburn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin,TX</strong>",100,5.0

The hotel lobby was nice and I stayed in the executive floor. I must say that my first impression of my room was rather disappointing. The décor of the room was rather old fashioned and lighting was rather melancholy like. The tiles of the bathroom was very outdated. On the early hours on the 27th, the electricity of the entire hotel was turned off from 2 – 5 a.m. due to electrical maintenance work. The room was quite big and well equipped in the room.

We were in Tokyo over the Thanksgiving week. The reviews from this site greatly influenced my decision in picking RPH and I am glad that I did. Every positive thing that was written about RPH is true and then some. After a 13 hour flight from the U.S., we arrived in Narita and took the Airport Limousine Bus from Narita to the T-CAT (Tokyo City Air Terminal). The Terminal is located adjacent to the Royal Park Hotel. I was pleasantlysurprised to see a dedicated phone for RPH as soon as we got out of the bus. Within 3-5 minutes of calling the hotel to inform then of ourarrival, a bell hop who speaks English arrived with a luggage cart to help us back to the hotel. I am starting to feel good about this hotel.We arrived at the hotel, which is connected to the T-CAT, and are promptly led to the executive lounge on the 16th floor to check in. Ah, yes, the executive floors. I took the advice of those that recommended the executive floors and, yes, the extra cost was more than worth it for my family. You can’t beat the convenience of a free buffet breakfast on the 20th floor and snacks and cocktails on the 16th floor executive lounge in the evening. With the price of food anddrinks in Tokyo, the difference in price is more than worth it. Add tothat the pampering and free access to the gym, pool, sauna, wireless internet in the executive lounge, etc…Our room was very nice and roomy even by American standards. It was very comfortable and we were able to adjust the thermostat. We had an executive twin suite with two twin beds and an extra bed. We had to pay an additional 5,000 yen ($47 approx) per night for the extra bed. The cost of the extra bed is worth it considering the alternative of having to pay for an additional room. My kids are still very young so it was comfortable for us. The room had a Dell computer with free highspeed internet service. I was also able access the internet with my laptop by connecting it to the Ethernet wire. The kids were able to access their internet games on the Dell computer while the wife and were able to surf the net on the laptop. The bathroom was nice and comfortable. I had mentally prepared myself for a very small bathroom based on some of the previous reviews, but it was okay as long as it was one person in there at a time. The Toto toilet is the bomb. The toilet seat is warm and it comes with a “shower” and bidet. Getting around town is easy from RPH. There is a train line under the hotel and access to the Tokyo rail system is only 5 minutes walk from the hotel. We were able to buy 2 day tourist rail passes at the front desk. The front desk staff is very nice and they were able to give us good directions and tips on using the Tokyo Metro Rail. This is the most economic way to explore Tokyo. The trains run on time and there is a train every 5 minutes or so. We were able to go to Tokyo Disney, Ginza, Roppongi, Ueno, and Akihabara. There are several convenience stores and Japanese restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. There is a McDonalds within 5 minutes walk of the hotel. Overall, this is a very nice hotel for the price. The location is convenient for getting around Tokyo. The staff was very pleasant and nice and most of them speak English. I am recommending this hotel veryhighly and will definitely be staying at the RPH next time I am in Tokyo.","Chicago, Illinois","worldtraveller079</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",8,5.0

To go to the Hotel from the Narita Airport is very convenient: the Hotel is 30 meters close to the Airport Bus Limousine (and the time between Narita and RPH is about one hour).We booked a deluxe room with King bed. The room was spacious with classy furniture, the bed was very comfortable, and we had a desk with a computer and free internet connection: so you don't have to go to a cyber coffee or to a dedicated lounge, you can surf directly in the room for free, which is very cool.

This was our first visit to Japan (and Asia for that matter) and we wanted something very comfortable, and accessible by the Limo Bus, in Tokyo. We decided on the Royal Park based on reviews here and on the looks of their website and couldn't have been happier.We decided to stay in an executive room so we could have access to the free breakfast buffet and cocktail hour, so we arrived at the hotel and promptly made our way to the 16th floor for check-in. The employee couldn't have been friendlier or more polite, and our room, on the 18th floor, was just gorgeous. We had a huge window with amazing views of Tokyo lit up at night. As we arrived at our room the maid was just finishing up turndown service, complete with a little origame box with mints in it. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom had lots of great amenities. We enjoyed turning on traditional Japanese music on the radio and then being able to pipe it into the bathroom for when we were soaking in the tub. The breakfast was amazing; one of the best I've had on my travels. It is free for those staying on the executive floors and is filled with a huge array of foods; breakfast meats, cereals, potatoes, French pastries (the brioche was delicious) and danishes, an omelette station, various fruits, and fresh-squeezed juices. All of this and amazing views of Tokyo from the windows of the 20th floor. The hotel itself is beautiful, with a lush lobby, and there is access to the subway from the bottom level of the hotel, making getting around a snap.

The executive floor rooms offer free full breakfast (western and japanese style), free access to the in-house gym, executive lounge access with complimentary happy-hour nightly with a well stocked bar (I had champagne every night). I completed their club application, which they had to mail to me, and in order to cut-down on processing time I decided to scan the application and emailed it to them.

Check-in for the executive floors is handled at the executive floor lounge.It's a nice upscale hotel with over 1/2 doz restaurants. They have an in-house gym with good equipment and a yoga/stretching room as well. I don't remember seeing a pool.

We were staying duing the rain that accompanied the recent typhoon, so my daughter made great use of the pool in the evenings since we didn't fancy walking around in the rain after a day of doing just that.The hotel is connected directly to the metro, so accessing places is very easy.

I had 2 separate reservations due to different room rates - I called the hotel directly to book a single room for the first night and used the corporate deal for the rest. The rate showed on the website was cheaper than the one which the hotel offered. The reservation staff who could speak native English explained that they were under different reservation quotas (The hotel itself and Summit Hotel Group Reservation), and she could not give me the rate showed on the website. I expressed my disagreement and finally she offered me a rate which was lower than the one I found on the website and with BBF (I thought it's 21000 yen inclusive tax versus 22000 yen inclusive tax without BBF).I arrived at about 11pm in the evening. Check-in was smooth and fast (within 5 minutes). The single room was huge, clean and with a good quality of double bed (about 4 feet width). I also found a set of ""Shiseido"" facial product, a bag of Japanese hot spring powder and a set of toiletries for men at the bathroom. Every room had a ""Dell"" desktop with TV monitor for the guest use. I moved to the another room with twin beds next day. But the room size was slightly smaller than the single room I got last night, particularly it's with 2 standard single beds. There's only a set of men toiletries at the bathroom. Besides, set up was the same as single room. Internet access was fast and smooth. I used my own laptop and hotel's desktop somtimes if I just wanted to check something on the web and update news. Room service was fast (within 20 minutes) and the meal was not too bad. They also tried to fulfill our request of ""French Fries"" which they did not offer. I found they did not charge internet access on my bill, it's probably it's included on my corporate deal. But I am so happy to get a in-room computer so that I can access it whenever I wanted to. Concierge provided excellent service - wrapping service, helping us bring our luggages to the T-CAT Terminal. Overall, RPH is a standard business hotel with a touch of surprise.
