I requested early check-in, since we were arriving about 5 hours before the 4 p.m. check-in. They held our luggage so we could go out and grab lunch and they texted me when our room was ready (2-3 hours early). The room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The beds were super-comfortable, which is a big deal to me - I often have a hard time sleeping, so supportive pillows and soft linens are really important. Towels and toiletries were replenished every day; we never had to ask for anything.The location on 45th Street is steps away from Times Square and most of the theaters; across the street from a Starbucks; and just a couple blocks away (in various directions) to Rockefeller Center, Bryant Park, and the train stations around 42nd Street. It was a roughly 20-minute walk from the hotel to the Intrepid Air, Sea and Space Museum. This hotel was an excellent home base for us; no matter where we were in the morning or early afternoon, we'd come back to rest for a bit before our evening plans.Years ago we had a terrible experience at a ""proper"" Hyatt in Florida and I wasn't sure I'd ever go to a high-end Hyatt property again. We've stayed in a Hyatt Place and liked it, but it took us six or seven years to be willing to try a property like this one. And they made it so wonderful. If you're looking for a comfortable hotel to be your home base in Times Square/Midtown, give Hyatt Centric Times Square a try.","Titusville, Florida","GetOutMama</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Titusville, Florida</strong>",13,5.0

Due to the pandemic NYC was very quiet so we were offered the chance to upgrade the room for $25 per night, we declined this as didn’t intend on being in the room that much. The room we had, on 20th floor, was really nice. Could see some of time square lights, plenty of room (By NYC standards) and a big bathroom. The hotel is yards from time square, an ideal location if you are a first timer to New York. I felt the pricing was a little inconsistent, when we asked before we arrived about cars to and from the airport we were quoted $120 (ish) each way, however, when we asked at the hotel it was $75 set fee. We opted for this as it was only $5 more than the total price of a set fee yellow cab. When we asked to keep the room on it was $50 per hour, which seemed excessive considering NYC was in an emergency situation and travel was prohibited from a lot of countries so rooms were available and an upgrade was only $25.Staff were helpful when needed. It’s clean and tidy but for some reason we both got electric shocks off of everything we touched. We ended up touching everything through clothes, which I suppose wasn’t bad thing considering the circumstances. Would stay here again.

This was my first experience at a Hyatt property in the US and my only previous frames of reference in terms of US hotels were Marriott and Hilton properties. This was a long 16-day trip and I was more than a little concerned about being comfortable. I was so cautious that I had my office split the booking so that I could check out if I was not happy. This hotel blew me away. The room and bathroom were great and everything worked the way it should. The decor and color schemes made everything seem airy and light. But the X Factor was the service. I have never experienced this level of warmth and friendliness outside of Taj, ITC and Shangri La properties in Asia. The staff were efficient, proactive, warm and friendly and they anticipated my needs. The GM of this hotel deserves to be commended for putting together and leading such a great crew. From Dyana and Michael at the reception; to Mickey at the bar; to Veronica in housekeeping to Jason, Walter and Luis, the doormen...HUGE shout out!

Floor 43. Fantastic view and GREAT staff in all areas of this hotel, My previous favorite hotel in NYC was Double Tree Suites Time Square which is now only history as it was completely torn down in 2019. The site will be a CTX luxury hotel, which is being built now to open in 2022. This Hyatt is better located than the Doubletree was as it is a half block down 45th st. from Broadway (heart of times square) AWAY from the constent crowds. The Doubletrees front door opened on to Broadway and was alwaus a mess. You pay for a better view if you reserve a room above floor 40. DO IT as you will be happy you did. Also, buy the breakfast package with the rooom. You eat in the very nice hotel restaurant NOT a buffet and order off the menu , the same meniu walk-ins order from.

Resort Fees here are $30 per room per night. They are not optional and must be paid. If they can't afford to run the hotel based on their advertised room rates then they should increase their rates, not draw people in with artificially low rates topped up with ""Resort Fees"". Apparently its for Wi-Fi, water in room and I think that's it.A deposit of $100 is required and check in is not possible without it. It must be on a hold on a card or if you want to leave a cash deposit its $350.00.

The staff were disinterested, no apology & no contact from the F&B team after I emailed my complaint, would not recommend the restaurant as the food was overpriced & underwhelming!

For those of you that think there is no wardrobe space after watching quite a few YouTube Videos, there is. It just looks like an adjoining door and the handle is a little stiff to pull.When we got there my wife read somewhere that the room is cleaned every three days, this wasn’t the case, it was cleaned every day with new towels, linen and water.Not sure if this was because we left a two to three dollar tip for them every time, but was well worth it.Because we were in Times Square I was also told we would hear loads of traffic noise from the room, we didn’t and we were on the 12th floor.The only downside was our view from the window wasn’t really that great, we could see the side of the Barclays building and another building under construction but no noise and that was the main thing.Most places in Times square are so busy and hard to just find a seat and have a coffee, however the Starbucks that is opposite to this hotel always had seats available. Nice to go there to clear your head if you need space from how busy 20 seconds around the corner is.By the way we knew we would have to pay tax on the room as you do for all hotels in New York. I believe sometimes this may be part of your package and it maybe worth asking the question before you book They put a hold on your Card when you arrive the same amount as what the room costs, so take this into consideration if you have assigned an amount of money you will spend in New York because a large amount will be taken as soon as you arrive to cover any charges on the room. To be fair you will get this back but minus the tax which in our case was $172 for five nights. We have only come back and not received it yet but I am sure we will.So if you have loaded up a pre paid card as we did try to add extra onto it because you won’t be spending this in New York and will be coming back with you, which is always nice to come back to.",,Zacazoom,0,5.0

Other than soap, shower gel and shampoo, there were no other bathroom essentials provided. Everything had to be requested which I found odd and inconvenient, especially for a Hyatt property.2. The pillows in the room were much too soft for me. I requested a firm pillow (which any decent hotel I've been to has - some hotels have a range of pillows including memory foam) but I was informed the hotel did not have any firm pillows - I thought that was odd.3. Hotels in NYC which are charging a resort / destination fee need to be highlighted, it's essentially a scam. Just because some other hotels do it and because it's detailed on the Hyatt website does NOT make it ok. This Hyatt cannot justify the $35 ($40.16 with tax) fee per night (!) with the very poor 'benefits' provided. More guests need to challenge the fee, otherwise more and more hotels will continue to add it to the headline rate.4. I was surprised at the lack of communal space - the lobby is tiny and there's nowhere to sit and relax other than the bar.As for location, if you want to be near Time Square then the location can't be beaten, but if you've been to NYC more than once then you may appreciate being away from the hustle and bustle.In terms of value for money, I booked my room at a promotional price so I thought the value for money was acceptable, but seeing how much the rooms are normally I would say this hotel is NOT good value for money as I would expect more luxury for the price.Overall this isn't a bad hotel, just not the luxury what you might expect from a Hyatt property.","London, United Kingdom","mkyni</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",59,3.0

I stayed in the Suite facing Times Square. The room was big enough for our family of 4 and the bathroom was the best part. Heated floors and room enough for all of us to be walking in the bathroom at the same time. Now besides that. My vacation started off stressful. I was never made aware before getting to the hotel that I would be charged all of my vacation plus $100 deposit per night. A “hold” was placed on my card that I was not going to use to pay for the hotel but had no alternative at the time was blocked for almost $2000. What I was gonna use for my vacation. When I’m questioning why I have to essentially pay before I even get in my room. The response is “this is how it always is” with an attitude. I’ve been to many hotels and many higher end hotels and none of them do this. They take a deposit and your card on file but no one blocks the entire stay plus a deposit for the duration of your stay + 5 days that it takes for the hold to drop. When I mention that this have never been done before in other hotels I’ve stayed at the response from the team member is “I’ve stayed at other hotels too” again with his attitude. I honestly don’t need that attitude. I’m on vacation and I’m already stressing and I don’t see how him staying at other hotels has anything to do in this situation. Off to a horrible start I didn’t even want to deal with the front desk anymore. The housekeeping staff however was wonderful and attentive. Always would say good morning and even hoped to see us again soon. Our second interaction with the front desk same person went even worse. My brother got to the hotel with his suitcase in the middle of the night as he had to take a red eye. I understand they ask to make sure he’s staying there. That’s fine no problem. But when he says he is they give him a card and say it’s $40/daily charge for the hotel. That didn’t make sense because we already had booked 4 people and been charged for the daily hotel fee for 4 people. When my mom went to ask about it to make sure it was already included and not additional. Just needed some clarification the team member again with an attitude called my brother liar saying no one had said it was $40 when it was written on his key card envelope they gave him. My mom said I’m not saying you did I’m asking for clarification and he just seemed like he didn’t want to deal with anything. We just left and avoided them the rest of the time. After that they didn’t seem approachable and didn’t feel like I could ask them questions about the city. In all honesty I personally won’t be staying again. Initial interaction and welcome is what makes or breaks it for me. I do recommend the room though.

I returned after lunch and housekeeping hadn't arrived, not until 4.30pm did I get a knock, I asked them to come back at 5pm.. I left and returned around 6.30 and only then was the housekeeping in my room, which is quite disappointing. I also asked front desk if I could get a later check out, after about 5 mins of clicking on the computer, she told me I could check out at noon. I'm pretty sure one hour extension is quite standard practise, if she was going to offer me til 3pm I'd understand wasting 5 minutes of my time! So I'm not sure the purpose of acting like that.

After spending several hours researching all nearby properties, I landed on Hyatt based on the location, room type, and reviews. I stayed in the King Suite w/ terrace. I will review a few different elements from my experience:- Location: Everything is so close! Times square is a block away. So many wonderful restaurants to choose from. Central Park is a nice walk. 9/11 memorial is a quick Lyft or taxi ride away. I spent several afternoons just walking and exploring the area.- Room: The room I was in was incredibly spacious by New York Standards. The room came with a refrigerator, desk, separate living room, sizable bathroom and shower. The view from the terrace is amazing! You have a clear view of Times Square, World Trade Center, Empire State building, and so much more. The only non-raving comments I have relate to the bed and pillows. The bed is fairly stiff but after 12 nights, I was accustomed to it. The pillows were so flimsy and seemed old. I asked for foam pillows after the first night (which are offered free of charge), which were only slightly better. The staff was incredibly accommodating and provided extra pillows and blankets.Food (T45 Diner): The food was very good! The restaurant has a nice menu and you can order anything off of that menu for room service. Room service was quicker than any other hotel I have stayed at in the last 5 years. Also, check out Bar54 at the very top of the building. It has breathtaking views and a nice ambience.Hotel Staff: 12 days is a long time to spend at a hotel and I can honestly say that I had great service from the hotel staff for the entire duration of my stay. From a wonderful check-in experience (thank you Ritchie!), the room service staff, the cleaning staff, and security, everyone was professional and kind.Overall, I would recommend this gem to anyone looking for a great place to stay in New York. Well done Hyatt!",,Sunshine591074,0,4.0

The hotel was very centrally located which made it easy to get around for sightseeing. Considering the hotel is a stone's throw from the hustle and bustle of Times Square, it was remarkably quiet in the bedroom. This was probably helped by the fact we paid extra to be high up, and the 49th floor was a real bonus with great views. The staff were all very friendly with great service from the cleaning staff who couldn't do enough. We didn't eat in the hotel, preferring to go out.

While searching for rooms online there are many sources indicating Hyatt Centric is a hotel where you can see the ball drop. The room we selected had a description ""Times Square view"". Prior to booking we called on 2 occasions to ensure we have the perfect room to watch the ball drop and be apart of the exciting celebration. Both times we were advised yes we would see the ball drop. The rooms we booked was very expensive and we thought it was going to be worth it, we were willing to spend the money since we did not want our children in the cold and insane crowd for this celebration. We checked in on 12/30 and was so very disappointed with our room, you could only see the back of a billboard next to a building that blocked most of the view of times square and the ball drop was not in view. Hyatt Centric Times Square NYC hotel was misleading and dishonest from day 1. We spoke to 2 different people at the check-in desk and they said none of their rooms can see the ball drop and we could purchase the top of the bar access for $1000 +per person if we wanted to see the ball drop...... they genuinely was not concerned about our disapointment. Their goal was to move us along and check in the next person. We booked 2 rooms for our family of 6 people and spent over $5k at this hotel. I called the front desk to ask for a manager and she apologized and said they would credit me for the inconvenience, I received a folio with a credit of $80 and then they charged me $100 without providing the folio for the 2nd room or explaining why I was charged.

Minutes from Times Square, handy for the Rock, Empire State, Union Station, Bryant Park, theatres, subway so that you can easily access Battery Park and out to Statue of Liberty and One World Tower, Madison Square Gardens to see the Ice Hockey (highly recommended) and anywhere you want to go at that end of the city. The rooms and beds are comfortable and well furnished (although one of our lights did not work) and the floor to ceiling windows in our Suite were superb. The staff at check-in were less than friendly but everyone else we met were lovely. The hotel has a rooftop bar with superb views day and night and it is a nice place to sit and have a drink after a busy day sightseeing. We had a lovely lady from Jamaica who cleaned our room and she could not have been any more friendly, chatty or helpful - I'm only sorry I did not get her name. The Assistant Operations Manager, Mr Rico Hernandez, was also very helpful when my daughter was unwell during our stay. I had breakfast in our room one morning and it was perfectly pleasant - fluffy, warm pancakes and hot tea. Reception staff were happy to organise more pillows, provide a sewing kit after a slight wardrobe malfunction and to provide a kettle when my daughter needed one. The bar downstairs is ideal for a drink or snack at the end of the day and the staff were nice - they even put drinks in plastic glasses to take up to your room on the one night we couldn't go out as planned when my daughter was unwell. The hotel was nicely decorated for the festive season and staff are very knowledgable and helpful. The hotel helped us arrange transfers to and from the airport, which was very reasonable and worked well. We were given a late checkout of 2pm as our flight was not until 8pm, and we apreciated this extra time to relax a bit. The only negative comment I have was on the location of our Suite. Security staff check that you have a key, so nobody can get around to the lifts and rooms without being challenged. We were in Room 1401 (suite), which is right above the main front entrance. Given the location of the hotel and the vibrant nature of New York, we fully expected noise. However, I did expect that we would get a night's sleep! Sad to say, none of us had one night's sleep in the 7 days of our holiday. The beds are so comfy it shouldn't be a problem, but the noise was horrendous! It starts at Midnight with a Refuse Collection right under your window which takes time, and all the associated noise/engine running (sometimes collectng from the other side of the road from restaurants etc), then there is another type of collection at around 3 am and then again at around 5 am. There is also a tremendous amount of building work/renovations and repairs to buildings to prevent falling masonry taking place and this goes on all night too, as the building with work across the road has a permit to work during the night, as do many buildings in the city. On one of the nights this led to work at 2 am where the street had one side coned off and an enormous truck full of supplies and 2 small vehicles going up and down with materials for several hours. I appreciate that this is not the fault of the Hyatt, however, had we had any knowledge of this we would not have stayed in this room! A good night's sleep means you can explore this amazing city in all it's glory all day and late into the night. As it was the run up to Christmas, the hotel was extremely busy or we would have enquired about a change of room. We feel that this coloured our view of value for money for this Suite - given the issues (and having stayed in many other Hyatt hotels and in busy cities), we feel that the price per night was too high. We did have a fantatstic holiday and can highly recommend a visit to ew York at this time of year. The hotel is really nice, but some prior information about the rooms would have been good. With a different room, we would recommend a stay here as the location cannot be beaten and it is a nice hotel.","Glasgow, United Kingdom","CumfyCritter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glasgow, United Kingdom</strong>",112,4.0

As soon as the sweet cleaning staff found out there were 4 of us in one room, they gave us extra towels and toiletries to help with our stay. I made sure to tip them every day to show our appreciation. The front desk accepted a delivery for me and then left it in our room while we were at a Broadway show like I asked them to - which was extremely helpful because it was meant to be a surprise upon our return to the room. =) We requested extra pillows because ours provided zero support, but literally, no matter how many you added, they went flat and you woke up with a sore neck the next day. As for getting questioned in the evenings when we went to get on the elevator... I know they are doing it because of the rooftop bar, but still, it's a hassle when you're just wanting to go to your room and don't want to have to stop to dig for a key to prove yourself. My daughter witnessed someone's son who ran down to get something from the front desk for his dad get stopped for a long period of time because he didn't take his room key down with him. I don't know how they can make this better, but it gets annoying. Overall, it's a nice hotel in a great location, and we would stay there again. I'd probably just have to pack a pillow!
