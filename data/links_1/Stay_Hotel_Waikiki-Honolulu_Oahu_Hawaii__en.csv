The front desk manager, Florencia, honestly turned my whole day around. She was so patient and kind, and it made all the difference. I ended up staying only one night, but it was still a great experience. The hotel is only a block from the beach, and there are plenty of convenience stores and restaurants nearby. The hotel itself had everything I needed, and the lobby downstairs even provided beach chairs and boggie boards you could borrow. There was also a store right next door if you wanted to rent a surfboard. I had an amazing time here, and if I ever return to Waikiki, this is where I'll be returning to stay.

Although the rooms are on the smaller size and twin beds are different from the queen beds in many hotels, as a single person traveling I was comfortable. The AC worked great, there's coffee in room and housekeeping service is good. I particularly liked the washer and dryer for guests as on day 3 I was ready to do laundry. They provide soap pods and dryer sheets at NO COST. This was really one of the highlights as a business traveler. They also have coffee downstairs with cream, flavored creamer and sugars. The only complaint is they use single serve coffee pods and living in Hawaii part time, this is not good for our island! The lounge is nice and peaceful for relaxing. Staff are GREAT!

They are in the heart of Waikiki and literally steps from the beach. Pros: the staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. I had a request right when we got there and within minutes of calling, someone came up and personally took care of us. Unlike most hotels that charge for bath towels, snorkel masks, and floatation devices, the Stay offers all of that for free... and no time limit. Aside from the towels, it was a first come first serve basis. Although there is construction happening right next to the hotel (out of their control) it was still a pleasant sleep as there was no noise coming into our room; we stayed on the 6th floor. The beds were low and comfortable!!! There are tons of restaurants within minutes from the hotel, there is an ABC store right next to it also. La cuchracha, Mexican restaurant and Shorefyre Restaurant were the closest and are located on Koa Ave and Uluniu Ave. The inside of the our room was nice. There is a microwave and small refrigerator with a tv that had all channels available. There was also a small AC that worked just fine. Just downstairs there was a restaurant and karaoke bar called Wang Chungs. They served good food and inexpensive drinks! Karaoke is $1 per song for those who want to show off their singing skills. Cons: I’m still going to them a 5 star rating because this con is just a personal preference (they met all of my expectations) however, I would have wanted more storage in the bathroom area. We had a lot of personal hygiene stuff that had to be put elsewhere due to lack of space in the bathroom. Overall: EXCELLENT STAY, affordable pricing, and GREAT LOCATION.

I gotta give a big shout out to Kitty at the front desk she was super accommodating, funny and friendly! If it was not for her we wouldn't have gotten to see half of the sights we saw because we kind of just took the trip and we're just going to play it by ear especially since it was only a 4 day trip. But thanks to her and her introduction of the Waikiki Trolley we actually got to see sights and go around the island.

We lost our booking (but got our money back thanks to Paypal). So we had to find a hotel quickly for the last two nights of our trip, having just returned from Maui. This one seemed reasonably priced and was in a good location. That is the only positive. This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I nearly cried when I walked in. There were two single beds, not even on proper bed frames but on very low chipboard bases. There was a small box air condition in the corner that was completely ineffective due to the TV unit blocking it. The bathroom smelt of mould and mildew and after using the shower for the first time, it wouldn't stop dripping. We were given a room on the third floor at the front of the building. This meant that at night, the streetlight shone right through the paper thin curtains. The coffee maker was situated on the TV stand, right in front of the TV and the wardrobe door was broken. This was the type of room that made you feel like someone was going to break in at any moment. It just had that vibe to it.

In terms of cleanliness a shout out to Mercy and her team for their friendliness and customer service. The Front desk customer service can improve with a 5 star rating only of they greeted their customers upon entry considering it's a small lobby. That didnt happen 1 out of 10 times and for that reason they were GOOD not excellent Now to my concerns, there are no security deposit box in the room and no cameras on each floor. Added to concern anyone can go up without a security pass as the elevators does not require a pass to go up. I have noticed some shady individuals on my floor. This could be due to the fact outsiders and local people frequent the K Bar in the main lobby.

In July 2018 my wife and I stayed here and we came in July 2019 with my 6 year old son. First the positives: This hotel is one block from the beach (Kapiolani Beach Park in Waikiki) - you can literally have your feet on the sand in less than 5 minutes. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, during both stays I was always given the utmost attention, towels for the beach are provided on request and there is always someone there to provide these for you, as well as beach gear available to use. Parking is available for a fee that is on par with the rest of the area, but there is limited space and some of the spots are a bit tight but it’s quite convenient. The hotel is also located less than a 2 minute walk from an Alamo rental car. Neutral/possibly negatives depending on your preferences:Currently there is the demo phase of a construction project in what I remember used to be King’s Something center. It can be rather noisy - however this is not any fault of the hotel and their work day ends around 17.00, if you are on vacation in Hawai’i This probably won’t bother you. There is a Karaoke bar on the first floor. There have been times where patrons were outside and gathered on the steps smoking, they never did anything purposely bad or menacing but they were speaking loudly with foul language in front of my 6 year old son on more than one occasion. I want to stress that in my 2 stays here I have never had any issues with intoxicated customers or anything like that. Loud AC. The AC is loud but works well, for me it provides good white noise to put me to sleep, but be aware it might be too loud for some people. Minor Negatives:I hate to say anything negative, but it seems my room this year is in some sort of WiFi dead space. Last year I stayed on the 5th floor and had no problems at all. This year we are on the 4th floor and our WiFi continuously drops the connection or works at extremely slow speeds. I am currently typing this in the lobby and have no issues. If I go outside my room towards the elevator all is well again. In my room it takes nearly 10 minutes to send one photo to my friends and family :/ In conclusion: This place is great. It is in a perfect location and great to use as a crash pad while you do your vacation stuff. The price is great for the location, you could pay upwards to 450 more dollars a night to stay at a larger hotel, but in my opinion if you are coming to Hawaii on vacation and you really just need a room to sleep in, Stay Hotel is perfect, After 2 stays I would definitely recommend it and plan to come here again next year.","St. Petersburg, Russia","Blackhawk42Actual</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Petersburg, Russia</strong>",3,5.0

If you have common sense of decency of what an actual hotel stay/accommodations are!We purchased via Hotels.com, as the pics looked OK, and was close to the beach etc. But if you have any sense of ""not wanting to be in tight/close/confined"" spaces, again... don't go here!The first room they gave us, I could literally, if I wanted, lay down on the floor, and could touch both sides of the walls, hand to foot. Way to small/claustrophobic for 2 people. THEN, the rooms all have the windows that can open up, with like 6 inch sections of glass. So the room/window is not really 'sealed/air tight'. Which means, as you can imagine.. HOT Air comes in, and COLD air goes out through all the little slits in windows. So yeah, the rooms don't ever cool off. So they put us into a 2nd room. And it was a tad bigger, but that was it. Still AC wouldn't cool off the room. AND, the Bathrooms of the first 2 rooms, were about the size of a closet. No sink space, just horrible.Finally, they moved us to a 3rd room. At least the bathroom was 'normal sized' like other hotels. But you still have the stupid openable windows. Still warm rooms. The ONLY way I could sleep, was because in this 3rd room, the little AC unit in the wall, just so happen to be next to the bed. So at least 1 of us got cool enough to sleep.The worse part is, even after these, and several other issues we had... they WOULD NOT REFUND US ANY OF OUR MONEY. We had paid for 3 days up front. I was ok with taking a 1 day hit ( and at least staying there of course), as I wanted to move to another hotel down the block. But both Hotels.com and the Hotel itself, refused to refund any part of our stay... even after expressing numerous dissatisfactions with our rooms, etc. So basically, we were trapped there!Next time I go to a place like this, I'll just book the 1st night... and if I like it, book the other remaining nites (as there's a pluthera of Hotels in this area)!

And Kalakaua street, which has pretty much everything on it (shopping, food, groceries, drugstores), is between the Stay and the beach.The room was small, but it was absolutely beautiful. We got a balcony and we weren't even expecting one! Toiletries like hand soap, shampoo and body wash are provided. The AC was on when we arrived, which helped us beat the heat.Stop obsessing over perks like free breakfast and enjoy everything else you get for free at the Stay: free coffee in the lobby, free use of their washing machine and dryer with free detergent and dryer sheets, free beach gear (towels, inner tubes, pool noodles, etc.), free newspapers, free computers to use in the lobby and, of course, free WiFi.Hawaii's weather may be quite warm, but the Stay's lobby is wide open, meaning the air flow keeps it from feeling stuffy.Wang Chung's is a cute karaoke bar in the lobby next to the elevator. Gay friendly and great prices on cocktails. One warning, though, their karaoke system might have a version of the song you pick that's been transposed to a different key to make it easier to sing, so be ready to think on your feet.A most wonderful hotel for our first time in Hawaii and one I recommend for your first, second, third time and beyond!","Minneapolis, Minnesota","l337sp34kr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",92,5.0

I was horrified, petrified and mortified when I arrived. The room was disgusting with a musky smell to it, the building itself is in absolute horrible condition, nothing is clean. The rooms are a cross between cheap college dorm and prison style. No wifi working in the room. Air con was at head level so while I was laying on the bed it blew cold air straight into my face like Antartica, and the aircon was very loud and noisy all the time. The bed was broken and falling apart. No tea or coffee facilities in room. No toaster, kettle, crockery or cutlery in room. No iron board in room. The bathroom was equally as bad, but not as bad as the balcony. First let me begin by saying that the curtains to the balcony were completely torn up and gross (in need of good clean). They were strung on on some sort of industrial looking metal wire. The balcony door and the jalousie windows cannot shut completely and therefore everything that you hear on the streets can be heard inside my hotel room. When it is bed time, it is like sleeping outside on the streets except that you are on a broken bed. The balcony was another massive disappointment, it is carpeted in astroturf, one part had marks and smell of cigarette butts while the other side had some sort of mould growing in the corner. The view was was 5 star if you live in prison. It was literary looking at other broken down, unoccupied apartment buildings in various state of despair. Not one washing machine was working. The Hotel is literally nothing like the add or pictures shown it to be on the Qantas  website and specially on this website. For this 'hotel' to charge anyone ""resort fee"" is absolutely ludicrous. It is more like a hostel than a hotel. But one point I’d like to empathize is that the photos are not accurate or current. The quality of this ‘hotel’ is below average and I would not recommend it to anyone. ","Brisbane, Australia","Phillippe_85</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",3,1.0

Abc store next door. Parking was easy and convenient. I see other's complaining about parking but here there's no 20 minute wait to get your car from a nearby parking garage so take that into consideration. Just walk down and out you go simple.

So, with a few days layover in beautiful Honolulu again, with my wife this time, we booked the Stay Hotel Waikiki again. Up front I’ll tell you this is not the swanky multi-storey Hotel in which many visitors to Waikiki are staying. But, it did not cost us anywhere near that of the big brand names in the neighbourhood. It is located only one block away from the beach and nearly centred on the popular strip. So, there are many restaurants, shopping and assorted activities within an easy walk. The zoo is about 10 minutes away, Diamond Head Park is about a 45 minute walk. We arrived on an early flight and the ladies at the front desk checked us into a room right away. The rooms of this 8 floor building are easily accessed by elevator or 2 wide stairways. Our room was plenty big for the two of us, with a comfy bed, clean sheets, a cold fridge and a tv with plenty of channels. The bathroom had a step-in shower stall, no tub. There is a comfy lounge area near reception, with free coffee machines, an ATM and water cooler. The locally popular Wang Chung bar is there too and is a lot of fun. With engaging bar staff, fun and friendly people filling the small space, a dance floor and ’pass the mike’ karaoke this is a fave spot of mine in Waikiki. Cocktails and local beers are well priced and promptly served with a smile. At checkout we needed our luggage kept for a few hours, which the ladies at the front desk happily obliged. When we returned to pick them up, Rence recognized us right away and was already on her way to retrieve them.To sum up, I recommend the Stay for its great value and personable staff for a comfortable stay in Waikiki.","Ottawa, Canada","RandJL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",14,5.0

One amenity is the WiFi however in my room my laptop could barely get 1 bar of signal and kept dropping it so I just tethered from my phone. The other amenities are pretty stupid honestly. Not worth $15/day. It’s just a hidden fee they use to gain back the discounted room rate. THERE IS NO POOL OR HOT TUB. Most disappointing thing here.

Do be aware if you’re like me and booked from hotels.com or expedia the hotel charges a $15 fee on top of everything upon checkin which was a turn off since you pay a resort fee when booking anyways.

The rooms don’t have real windows, so even though we were on the 5th floor, we heard EVERYTHING outside. And since it’s right behind the huge Hyatt, there’s a lot of trucks/trash trucks that drive by. Don’t plan to sleep past 5am because it is so loud. We had the AC constantly running (bc it’s a small window unit that is terrible) and a white noise app as loud as possible and it was still extremely loud and impossible to sleep - and I have a toddler and am a heavy sleeper used to sleeping distractions!

The noise levels seem to be amplified through the corridor between buildings and the room only has shutter windows that don't block out any noise. For three mornings in a row we were woken at 4am with truck reversing sensors, garbage trucks emptying bins and construction noises. One night we even had someone throw bottles at our room windows. We wouldn't recommend the third floor (Unless the hotel gets sealed windows, which I would highly recommend for a more comfortable stay for guests), we did ask for a room change half way through and while it seemed difficult, we ended up on the 6th floor which was a lot better, although the wifi doesn't work the higher you go.

They provide free coffee in the morning and have all the beach toys you could ever want to borrow and take to the beach. How cool is that? Oh buy the way the beach is a block away super easy walk.

The bed was very comfortable (I slept so soundly).The pictures on the wall give the room a tropical feel (I forgot to take pictures lol). The shower water pressure was great! We had a room that had a clear view of the ocean looking to the right. We had a larger room this time. I saw other rooms and they still meets my needs of having a clean, safe comfortable room to lay my head after a long day of play. If you are looking for fun you don’t have to go far. Wang Chung’s is right downstairs! Have a Lychee Martini. Yum! Stay Waikiki’s great location allowed us to explore so easily. Ocean, shopping, fancy restaurants and local eateries.

This was my third trip, but a disappointing one, because of my hotel quality. I had reservation via Hotel.com at a 2 star Stay Hotel for $161.52 per night including the resort fee, which was a junkyard, especially for its price, upkeep, and the services they provide: The room fridge, the public ice-maker were out of order, the windows and the door to balcony were impossible to open; the mattress was old and torturous; the cooler was extremely noisy and was next to the bed, blowing the cold air into my face and head, which finally made me sick. When I workup sick in the middle of the night and called the front desk repeatedly, no one was there to answer the phone. Then their only elevator stopped working and they had to wait for the part to be sent from mainland. I finally moved to a wonderful hotel, Pearl Hotel, a 4 stars hotel near International Market place, where the manager, Steve, gave me an upgrade suite that was extraordinary for $117.00 including all fees, taxes and resort fee.

Location to everything was great- however there was a lot of construction work going on and constantly car alarms going off all through the night and early hours of the morning. This wouldn’t have been an issue if there were ACTUALLY PROPER WINDOWS. That’s right- no windows. They are literally just glass slats that you normally can slide up and down to let air in so there is no protection from outside noise whatsoever. The bed was nice and comfy- however the “pillows” I use this term loosely because were like rocks. The room had a microwave which was great and a mini fridge. Bathroom we couldn’t fault except maybe a plug would have been nice so we could have used the bath facility that we pay for in the room rate and resort fee. Parking was a high of $25 a day which hardly makes it worth hiring a car. Maybe a first come first serve basis with free parking considering we paid $100 AUD in resort fees .... feel like I should be entitled to cheaper or free parking... Hotel had free coffee and water which was greatly appreciated and the staff were lovely and kind so I can’t fault them on that. All up- we paid $1300 AUD for 7 nights- my advice get an air BNB or go at a less busier time of year so you’re not paying through your teeth for a room at a decent hotel. **note we aren’t high maintenance. 22 year old and a 26 year old who gladly stay in hostels. In this case a hostel would have been better because at least we know what to expect and it’s half the price. ,,aleisha f,5,2.0

It’s a short walk from the main part of the strip.Parking: There’s a space or two in front of the hotel just to drop off and pick up. I can’t remember if the hotel itself has parking but there’s a $7 a day/night parking lot just down the road near the corner shopping centre (up the road just before the hotel itself).The Room: We got room 401. In terms of noise, it let almost everything into the room when the slatted windows were open for air. This might be remedied by asking for a room on a higher level.When we first got in (middle of the night), we realised only one (of two) of the lamps worked in the room, so the room itself was really quite dark, we pulled the lamp to the middle of the room.The room itself is spacious but there was nothing more than a bed and tv stand in the room. It could use a seat or two and a table, to eat or watch tv on.The Bathroom: Again only one light, which made the windowless room feel even smaller. But it seemed clean.Service: The front desk team were really quite nice and upbeat. They helped with queries. Only note is that they forgot to call for the airport taxi (flat rate $29) the night before, but they were able to call for a taxi on short demand ($40) (5am).Overall: Ok hotel, I wouldn’t stay here for longer than a few days (my sister and I stayed for 3 nights).","Sydney, Australia","aniikinz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",19,2.0

The hotel itself is OK, I would say it's a step up from a hostel. If one does not like having shared facilities like a hostel but is on a budget, this would be the place for you. The room is a good size, the bed is comfortable, but as some other travelers have noted, there is no headboard. That’s OK, I just used one of the pillows and propped it up. The bathroom is very small but manageable if you are not fussy or only staying for a short time. Funny thing is, when I opened the bathroom door I didn’t see a shower! All I saw was a sink and toilet. Turns out the shower was just behind the door. There are no toiletries only soap and shampoo dispensers, which does not dispense that well. The sink and shower fixtures are old and could be updated but it works, if that’s all you care about. It was rather noisy in the late night with people chatting and hollering (I guess some people don’t need to sleep) in the street and then early morning with the sounds of garbage trucks etc., so bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. Otherwise, a good place to stay as it is cheaper than most hotels in Honolulu and the best thing about the hotel is it’s very close to the beach, literally just a couple minutes walk. Like most hotels in Waikiki, the hotel charges amenities fee and this place charges ~$10 a night, which is considered cheap. As I only stayed overnight, I did not take advantage of the amenities but it included beach towels, laundry facilities, coffee/water in the lobby, computers in the lobby to use and of course the wi-fi. The hotel also has a karaoke bar if one is so inclined. Looked like a lot of fun! If you are looking for a clean and basic place to stay this is it.

Located approximately 100m from the beach, where stands Duke's statue, you can ask for as many beach towels as you like when going that way. There are a selection of tea-bags at the desk, and hot water 24 hours and coffee almost as much (except when they take away the pots to clean them late at night.) An added perk are the washing and drying machines for clothes which are free; they even give you the detergent and softening papers. With a serious jet-lag (which I never quite got over) I could always use the machines in the middle of the night while all others slept.While the rooms are clean, the unfortunate downside of the hotel is the noise and minimal furniture. Alongside the tea-bags is a bowl of free earplugs, which says much more than words can tell. There is a constant noise of machinery, probably the air-conditioners all around from the hotel and surrounding buildings, which the jealousy windows let in freely. Being particularly sensitive to noise,I slept with my noise-cancelling earphones. Also, it is located just behind the Hyatt, across from the parking lot. Corner rooms get the noise of the street and the arrival of all the tourist buses which beep, leave their motors on and let out noisy groups. The other downside is the furnishings: there are no drawers in any of the rooms that I saw. Some rooms have nothing more than a closet and a bed, with no chair, table or even a night stand for a cup of tea or for your glasses or morning medecine. On the other hand, there are better appointed rooms with all these pieces of furniture, but still no drawers for underwear.Electronically, the wifi is imperfect and works better in some rooms than others and the same is true for the telephones. One room had a telephone that could not receive calls but could only call out. The answer as to furniture and electronics is that it is an old hotel and they have asked head office to take care of these things, but it was obviously not to be done during our stay.In conclusion, if you are sensitive to noise this hotel is not for you. But if you are on a tight budget (in which case I wonder what you are doing in Honolulu which is generally quite expensive) and have no difficulties with ambient noise, this would be a good choice.","Paris, France","enelram s</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",38,3.0

This hotel is in a great location. It sits immediately behind the Hyatt which centers on Waikiki Beach in front of the Duke statue. As for the rest of it, I think the proprietor of this hotel is really missing the opportunity to make this a great place. One immediately knows what the standard of a room will be when walking into the lobby. The lobby is typically the most well maintained and updated area of a hotel, so I knew we were in trouble with the room before even setting foot in it. And boy - did their photographer earn his/her money? The pictures on the Internet were very deceiving. The room was very dated and dingy. The bathroom is tiny and just awful for a hotel in this area. The room slept 4 but when the second bed is a fold-out futon, it's really 3. The noise in the morning is unbearable. We experienced a lot of banging and what sounded like trash trucks going to work at around 6am. They have an amenity fee for using their beach towels and a Keurig coffee maker in their lobby. For $25.00, the parking is first come, first serve for only a handful of spaces. To be fair, that's the case in a lot of places, but it certainly doesn't help Stay's cause. In any case, you're likely to be on a waiting list for that parking and as a result, you'll need to park two blocks away in another $25.00/day public lot. But if that public lot is out of spaces too, you're S.O.L. In short, spend the extra money or walk a little further and ""STAY"" (pun intended) in another hotel till the owners of this place can catch up with other boutique hotels in Waikiki.",,Anthony R,4,2.0

I stayed here from November 30th to December 7th, 2017. I've lived on the island of Oahu for two years so I'm no stranger to astronomical prices for everythingggggg. Hotels in Hawaii are expensive, and there's now around it. I knew that when I looked for hotels and booked this one. I The listed price is $100 on average. I feel like the prices on Expedia (where I booked this hotel) were slightly misleading. You are charged $11 a day for ""amenities"", and this price is excluded from room's price. Also, parking is $25+ tax a day. So I was essentially paying about $140 a night for the days I needed parking. Luckily, I only needed the parking garage for 4 days. The hotel is SUPER BASIC. I needed an iron. The hotel does not provide one in the room, and the front desk did not have one either. Toilet paper is one-ply. The beds don't have headboards. The room was extremely small too. I stayed in a room with twin beds, but it was just me so no biggie. The shower is just that, only a shower. No bathtub. The shower is lowkey small. I'm 5'8"", 140 pounds, and there was barely any room. One of the beds was placed right in front of the closet so I couldn't open the closet. The staff was super friendly and helpful. There's no valet, no doorman to help load and unload bags, none of that. Like I said, the hotel is super basic. I would stay here again if I were on a budget, but ONLY IF I WERE ON A BUDGET. The A/C is a window A/C as is normal in Hawaii, but it got super cold in my room so no complaints there. My only real complaint was that the sink was so small. MY GOD. It's literally just a sink, not a bathroom counter. When I washed my face in the sink, water would get all on the floor. I bought my own towels, blanket, and pillow so I can't speak on any of that, but the bed was comfy. Oh, also the wifi is free, but it sucks. I got disconnected often while on my laptop, and when I was using my phone, I would just web browse on my carrier's network about half the time. I was on the 6th floor so I wasn't disturbed by the bar downstairs or the street noise. Location is convenient. The beach is literally two blocks over. Wait, I said this wouldn't be too wordy. Oops! Also, I didn't find any roaches in my room. Yay for that. I give it three stars because it's just average. Nothing spectacular at all.","Charleston, South Carolina","53jeneana</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charleston, South Carolina</strong>",4,3.0

They don't have a kitchenette but we did get a microwave, fridge and coffee compliments in our room. The rooms are good sized rooms and can fit 4 adults and kids comfortably.The greatest advantages staying here is location. It's in the heart of Waikiki. From the beach to the shopping to restaurants, it is only a walk away from the hotel. It is also right next to one of the main pickup points for tours and adventures which is the Hyatt (right in front of stay waikiki).We were also blessed to have wonderful customer service from the ladies at the desk. It's a 24/7 desk and they are wonderful and helpful. I think the only disadvantage is if you arrive early (we flew in at 6.30am) you will need to wait till check in time which is 4pm...so best to have something planned in case you arrive early and your room isn't ready. We had to wait till about 3pm for our room to be ready so best to have something planned like shopping or lunch etc... to burn time. However they can look after your bags whilst you do that.Overall I would recomend you stay here as it's cheap and location makes it better than Some fancy hotels.

Great location (one short street back from Waikiki beach) and spotlessly clean. Service is friendly and accommodating.

Coffee brew machine in room, microwave and fridge is good. Bathroom is spotless and I was happy with the soap dispensers and towels. Coffee and tea downstairs in reception is nice Kona coffee, a nice surprise.Parking just off site for $25 per day. Reception couches are nice to lounge on.They offer beach towels and beach equipment (boogie boards and mats) to borrow for free. One recommendation? Ask for a higher floor as possible, busy street noise up to 2nd floor on outside rooms is very very disruptive at sleep time if this is important to you. If not. Ask for complimentary ear plugs.

The location is great, really convenient for being central to Waikiki, but that's really where it stopped. We checked in and after filling in numerous pieces of paper were told that they only had 2 cribs instead of the 3 we spoke about on the phone the day before. They then told us we hadn't actually paid and took our card details again (we have since confirmed that we were charged when the original booking was done online and then again at the counter.). On top of that the prices quoted online did not include tax or an 'amenities fee' which we were advised is compulsory. So the price kept jumping up and up. This has been resolved quickly and courteously via email by their staff. This made us happy. The rooms were of an ok size but the bathrooms were smaller than a normal public toilet cubicle, no good if you are trying to shower children (which we were). The rooms were lit up like Christmas trees at night due to outside lighting and curtains off the wall. I woke up, saw it was light and assumed it was morning, checked my clock and it was 12.45am. We turned our air on off to try and cut the constant sound but it made no difference as the loud units from ever other room continued to drone. Being charged for parking the next morning without being advised of the twenty five dollar fee was another little surprise for when we checked out. This didn't appear to be a cheap room for the one night, they are clearly relying on the convenience factor. All in all, pretty underwhelming, the location is probably enough to get us back but we would look at other first.

As soon as we arrived there were people arguing with the receptionists asking for their money back and refusing to stay a day longer, we chose to ignore it and thought the guests were being dramatic but we were wrong. We had initially had booked to stay in this ""hotel"" for 1 week. I would say it's closer to a motel but we will let that slide as well. our first night at the hotel we were woken up in the middle of the night to our toilet exploding. Just what you need on a vacation right?The water from the toilet had flooded our entire room and had reached the beds we were sleeping on and destroyed all of our luggages. This occurred at roughly around 3 a.m. So I went downstairs to reception and told them about the situation. They were reluctant to come up and resolve the issue and told us they'll just give us a room upgrade. They did not care that our luggages were drenched in dirty sewerage water and were not fussed about the situation in the slightest bit. We were too exhausted to argue at this point therefore we accepted to move rooms and deal with the situation in the morning. This so called upgrade was from a room with a king bed and sofa (for 3 people) to a room with 2 single beds that were no bigger than the massage beds you see at a massage parlour. We had no choice but to have 2 people ""sleep"" or should I say lay there awkwardly on one single and The other sleep alone. Come morning time (7-8am) we headed down to reception to them trying to gain some sort of money from us as they blamed us for the toilet explosion and used the excuse of there being ""too much sand in the toilet"" and therefore it ""being clogged"" it was our first night there and we had only used to the toilet once, and hadn't even gone to the beach that day in order for sand to get into the toilet. After telling them this, they refused to listen and told us to leave the premises asap or the police would be contacted. We were all clearly very shocked and surprised so we asked them to give us our money back so we could leave. They refused to do this as well and just kept insisting that we leave or else they will call the police for harassment (because we wanted our money back) and trespassing (because we no longer wanted to stay in their ""hotel""). MIKE was the name of the man at reception whom made our experience a living hell. He was the one who threatened us by attempting to call the police. He also refused to let us contact his manager as he was scared he would ""lose his job"" for contacting her (Erika) on July 4th as she was busy celebrating, which made it clear that the employees and management of stay hotel obviously value their own fun and leisure rather than helping and caring for the people staying at their hotel. Mike was sitting back in his chair relaxed the entire time whilst us (3 ladies) were on the verge of breaking down. He did not offer to help nor did he try to work out a solution. All he did was tell us to leave or the police will be on their way to escort us out. needless to say, we had no place to stay for an entire week because of STAY HOTEL WAIKIKI and their irresponsibility, drainage issues, lack of care and empathy and unprofessionalism & prioritising a day off rather than providing shelter for people who have paid for it.","Sydney, Australia","AshyBiber</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",5,1.0

We verified with the front desk staff and they confirmed with us this is a 3-star establishment. We chose to believe and checked into our room. When we entered the room, I went straight for the light switch next to the door hoping to turn on some lights but nope, nevermind, the switch is NOT connected to any lighting in the room. In fact, the only lighting equipment in the room is a night lamp by the bed that has its own switch on the stand.With the lights on we had a good look of our 3-star hotel room. ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" is the only thing in our head - picture motel rooms you see in some 50s American movies and that's what you get - windows open to the hall way right above your bed, air-conditioning unit right above your head, tiny bathroom (again, with window opening to the hall way) and some tv cabinet from the 50s.We would not be so furious IF we were not told that this is a 3-star hotel. The fact that this is a hostel/ 2-star motel pretending to be a 3-star hotel is what frustrated us. We feel cheated and lied to.We asked for refund (since we booked through priceline express deal) as soon as we checked in so we could book another hotel, but were told a decision couldn't be made until the next day since the manager was not on duty. Not wanting to spend extra money that we shouldn't have to, we stayed the night, despite the bright light from the corridor shining right above our head and nice noisy air conditioner above the bed.As of today, a week after we checked out, we are still waiting for an explanation from either the hotel or priceline regarding the 3-star rating policy. We feel really bad for whoever getting this hotel through the express deal hoping for a 3-star nice hotel. It is NOT what you're going to get.P.S.: Both my fiance and I travel a lot (200+ days a year) /work in the hospitality industry, so we have a reasonable understanding/expectation of star-rating.",,luvlytraveler,13,1.0

The hotel is not glamorous, but was perfect for our active family. We had enough room for everyone. The beds were comfortable. The rooms were nicely appointed. And the location was fantastic. We walked to Waikiki Beach in about 30 seconds. We felt safe. We trolley-ed to Diamondhead Crater and Hamauna Bay. The Pearl Harbor tour bus picked us up right outside the front door. There were many, many shops, restaurants, and other stores within a very short and enjoyable walk. One of our favorite things was the little farmers market that sets up 3 nights per week just down the street on Koa Ave. The food was great! Overall, this hotel was great.

However, to our dismay, we were woken up at around 6:00 am to the (yes literally) deafening sound of jackhammering and construction directly outside of the room. The jackhammering continued for around 3 hours until sometime after 9 am when it calmed.  I understand that the construction next door was no fault of the hotel's. However, the room was completely and utterly unusable (even to sit in it was so loud and unceasing) for those hours.  We are all college students and have been working for a long time to afford and put together this vacation. In fact, we would have been fine with the construction if we had been warned about it in on the hotels website; once again I understand the construction is not the hotel's fault but it IS their responsibility to tell their guests so we can make an informed decision.  Unfortunately, when I talked to the staff (who were very understanding and professional) all they could offer was our 10 dollar resort fee back (which covers the use of pool floaties and coffee...) The manager, Carolyn Pinho, messaged me later thanking me for the stay and asking for any feedback. However, when I wrote her a professional and calm letter informing her of our experience, she never responded. This we believe is unacceptable for the experience we received. Although we would have been very satisfied with the stay otherwise, this experience was extremely unpleasant hence the poor review. The price is tempting, but you are in Hawaii!

It was clean, rooms were of a good standard and staff friendly. Biggest issue was the noise! We were on the 5th floor and our room was at the very end. This meant we had an extra window on the side which in fact wasn't even a window it was some kind of plastic blind type 'window' which let in every bit of noise. We were woken up every day to the bin men outside on the street clearing the bins. 4am on our first morning we were woken up and then again at 5am and 6am so we never slept well. This would put me off staying again to be honest. But I would like to think we were just unlucky being in an end room with the extra plastic window.Bathroom needs updating too.Overall the hotel itself and the room is decent. Staff were great and free beach towels each day were helpful. The beach is literally a 30 seconds walk turn left and then right and it's right there which was perfect. Location perfect.

Well first of all Waikiki has a big parking problem and for me if you do not want to pay the fee then don't rent a car. We rented a car and enjoyed driving the island, it's was worth the fee. The only reason why I rated the hotel a 4 instead of a five was the WI-FI, it would recycle once in the morning and once in the afternoon and I would be without WI-FI for as much as two hours after each recycle.

I'm just going to list the pros and cons and you can make your own decision on whether or not this is a place you'd like to stay. Pros: cheap, for Honolulu standards. $124 on Orbitz, room only. Very small but nice lobby with pod chairs outside to sit in and relax. Free coffee in the morning. Comfortable beds, new bed linen, and soft towels. Rooms very very clean. Free wifi. In a pretty good location for food, beach and shopping. Staff very accommodating and polite. Cons: night club on the lobby floor can be loud if you are staying right above it. We had to move rooms. $10/night ""resort fee"". I'd hardly call this place a resort. They should up the price a few dollars instead. I was shocked at this fee. It may be on their website but I didn't see it and no reviews I read said anything about it. Supposedly its for beach towels, etc. whatever the etc is. They have a parking lot if you have a car. The fee is $25/night. Again big hotels charge for this kind of perk but really for this place? To top it off we got to the hotel late (after 10pm) and the lot was full we had to park down the street and pay $30/night. Staff said this is where they always recommend their overflow cars to park. It was within walking distance. Just around the corner. Like I said we had to change rooms. Our 6th floor room was more spacious than our 2nd floor room, but it is small. VERY SMALL. I was prepared for that. But what I was not prepared for is the fact that there was no place to put your clothes. You will basically have to live out of your suitcase. Ok for one night. Not so great for more than that. Beds were comfy, but only mattress no box spring so it's low to the floor. The room was freshly painted and as updated as it could get for being as old as it was. No place in bathroom for toiletries and the only mirror was the one above the sink in the bathroom. We had a room with an east facing window, this made the room uncomfortably hot in the morning when I was trying to get ready for the day. The curtains are not black out or even close so if the light bothers you, you'll be up early. The window unit, which they have in all rooms had trouble cooling the room. It wasn't awful but I had to sleep with no covers. Overall, you get what you pay for. Would I stay again? Probably not. Would I recommend it, that depends on whether you would choose price over space and comfort. Let me be clear about two things: this place was very, very clean and the staff excellent. Just not my cup of tea.","Fort Worth, Texas","seeling8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Worth, Texas</strong>",17,3.0

The service and internet fee from the hotel is more than $10 a day in which internet use is meant to be included. Housekeeping was lovely but the rooms were small. There is a fridge and microwave in the room and we also had a balcony. AC was very loud so we had it off for most of the time. However our room was facing the street on 7th foor and it was SO loud in the middle of the night.

There is free coffee in the lobby throughout the day and you can get beach towels and beach mats from reception too.

Also if you liked the hand-chairs in the pictures be prepared to be disappointed. Our unit had none. Nothing about the room looks like the pictures, except that the walls were white (kind of). They claim that they are redoing their website for new pictures, and note - they are not for the better. Also, they claim they are planning on renovating the bathrooms. Please note - it is such a small space - they can't possibly make it all that much better. The whole room feels like a mix between a dirty pool change room and a one star hostel.The rooms are significantly smaller than they look, the bathroom isn't big enough to function (the toilet is under the towel rack, the door can barely clear the sink and you can only get in the shower if the bathroom door is completely closed. The bed is terribly uncomfortable. Feels like a futon mattress on a wood plank.The website says you may have a balcony on your room by request. We requested and their response was ""no"" with no other information or explanation.Also, there is no soundproofing and previously unbeknownst to us, there is a karaoke bar downstairs that is loud and goes late and garbage pick up starts at 6:30am.

It was older and could use a renovation, but everything worked and it met our needs. Microwave and fridge in the room + free coffee in the lobby was a nice touch.

I experienced all 5 of the major complaints from previous reviewers. First, you will not be acquiring that room you think you paid for when you book the hotel, the reality does not imitate the pictures on the website. When I asked the staff, they explained that they haven't had an opportunity to photograph their existing rooms to upload on the website, and yet they had time to do so for their renovated rooms. I didn't get the opportunity to photograph my first room, so I'm using another TripAdvisor's photo (@tamarab890). You can see below, the first picture is the room I thought I booked, the second is the room we were booked in for, and the third is the room we actually stayed in after some concerns we shared with the staff. Secondly, I noticed a day in that our bedsheets weren't being changed, so I enquired at the front desk as to whether we do receive that service and they confirmed that it should be changed each time housekeeping visits. Unfortunately, they forgot a second time to change the sheets, as I used lipstick to leave faint marks in order to determine their cleanliness, but they were still there. We began leaving notes with our tips asking for the bed sheets to be changed, and that's just poor form. The wifi isn't temperamental, it doesn't work 85% of the time and that's the same with the television, it's easier to purchase an AT&T SIM card if you're not a local American for $45 for unlimited data and just stream. Lastly, the noise, our balcony doors were solid, it was the blind-like windows above our bed that allowed the noise in and it wasn't from the karaoke bar downstairs, it was the trucks delivering stock to the hotels behind us every hour of the night. You would have had the same experience sleeping on the street, or better yet, booking a nicer hotel at the last minute before your trip that would still be cheaper and much more pleasant than staying at this hotel. It's disappointing because most of the staff are very accommodating and friendly, and that's the only highlight of this hotel, so essentially you'd just be paying for good customer service (My 1 star is for the staff). Also, the hotel manager that comments on everyone's bad reviews doesn't have the power to improve your awful experience unless they were to refund everyone who has booked this hotel at the beginning of their stay and suggest they find another place. For those of you looking to book this hotel because it seems the most economical at the time, you've been warned.","Keilor Downs, Australia","Lynn T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Keilor Downs, Australia</strong>",15,1.0

Unfortunately, it proved disappointing. One of the walls of my room consisted entirely of glass shutters that could not be fully closed. Consequently, you could hear every bit of noise on the street throughout the night. Bear in mind this hotel is located on a busy street in central Waikiki, so it was very noisy. In addition to traffic, I heard a noisy fight between several Australian tourists around 2am. There is a karaoke bar downstairs, so I suspect the hotel attracts a lot of noisy revelers.The bathroom had similar shutters, albeit smaller, which meant that people on the upper floors of the neighboring building could see in. The shower was difficult to get in and out of.The room had no table or desk - there was nowhere to put belongings. The room consisted of two twin beds, which were genuinely twin beds, effectively the smallest beds I've seen in any hotel.The Wifi was woefully slow, which was irksome given the $10 'amenity fee' for things such as Wifi.

I selected a queen room with sofa, not the cheapest option. Upon arrival I was 'upgraded' to a condo. I thought wow can't complain! Then was lead out the back of the property, across the road, a few doors down and up two flights of stairs. At the top of the stairs the very helpful staff member opened the door and tried his best sell on a very old room. I look around, thought this is not what I was expecting but I'll give it a go. After a humid evening I thought I would have a shower and refresh before bed. The shower was very old and I was not prepared to use it without thongs on my feet. So I got ready and turned on the water. It came out of the bottom tap and was almost brown to begin with and I could not switch to the shower head. I called the front desk (from my mobile phone as there is no phone in the room) And the lady said she would send a maintenance man. I quickly got dressed and the man arrived within minutes, he was not able to get the shower to work either. I called the front desk again, there were no empty rooms to relocate me to so I had to stay. The girl was able to find me a room that was an early checkout and allowed me to use the shower in there. NOT IDEAL. Said I will need to come and see the manager in the morning for alternative arrangements. So I went to the desk at 9am as advised but no manager on duty today. The front desk attendants were very polite and as accommodating as can be but after two phone calls to the manager were still not approved to give me a refund so I could check into a new hotel. As I was not prepared to leave without a refund I had no choice but to accept another room. The other room was better than the first, it is part of the main 'hotel' although external facing so quite noisy.

We were a little worried at first because we didn't realise there was a bar downstairs and thought this might result in lots of noise- but the doors of the bar seem to be totally sound proof! The wifi in the rooms was really patchy, but it didn't take much effort to use the wifi in the lobby which always had a good connection. Small but clean rooms.

When you walk in the main floor is setup with several leather like couches, hammock chairs, LCD TV, 2 computers and printer, tea and coffee available all day with a modern look. Friendly faces at the counter doing their best. My low score reflects the several attempts I made to resolve issues on our week stay where the staff and management failed.(1) The staff seem ill prepared to answer questions about the area. It is my expectation that the hotel should have some ideas about the restaurants and attractions in their area. Many AIRBNB hosts have lists of places and instructions to get there. In our case we asked about a place 2 blocks and 7 minutes away (Marukame Udon restauarant) highly rated on Yelp. The two people could not figure out how to get there even thought they knew it was always busy. Ended up finding our way there.(2) When we used the shower for the first time we noticed the shower head was not fully turning on (RM 407 I believe). Hot water was going to the head and very little cold water. A third of the water flowed through the tap. We reported this 3 times to the front desk. The third time i went up to the room with maintenance person and demonstrated the issue. I was nicely told that they could not do anything about this. It was known by maintenance that the fixture were old. There was no concern that someone could get scalded from hot water.(3) Room cleaning service was poor. The sink and bathrub were never cleaned the week I was there. I ended up cleaning it myself as their were bits of paint flaking off and the sink was not draining correctly. As far as I could tell towels were changed, garbage were emptied and beds made. No change when i left sign out to clean.Finally I did ask twice to talk to a manager about my experience (first attempt 3 days before i left). No one contacted me. Our last day I got an e-mail asking for feedback. As a result I posted this review. I am disappointed that staff did not block this room so it could be repaired and provided another.My advice when booking here is that you fully inspect the room. I've never had to be this detailed before as I expect some common sense by the hotel. But in this case they are just filling rooms. Also keep in mind that you are behind the Hyatt and you will here all kinds of noise starting from 3-4 am.","Toronto, Canada","Randy R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",14,2.0

As a solo traveler without a car, Stay was perfect. Literally 30 seconds from the beach, walking distance to every part of Waikiki and beyond, a block from The Bus, and is a safe, clean hotel. The folks at the front were amazing - super friendly and welcoming, and they offered great recommendations for restaurants, things to do, and places to see.About the room: the room was not large, but it was clean and airy and streamlined. My room also had a balcony, which was a huge bonus. The air conditioning worked really well (it was a typical window unit, so if you're not used to that, it may be louder than you expect, but certainly not LOUD). The water pressure in the shower was awesome, and the showerhead was super tall. Free coffee / tea in the hotel and room, free and fast WiFi as well (fast enough for video streaming, no problem).About the hotel: there is a karaoke bar in the ground floor, but I never heard it from my room and really only could hear the patrons when I was in the lobby AND the door to the bar opened (so, really unnoticeable). There's one elevator which was super fast - I was worried at first it would be slow to get up and down from the 6th floor, but I rarely waited longer than maybe 30 seconds.Most importantly - the Hyatt Regency is across the street. That's a huge hotel, with a steep cost per night, and if I were to leave my room at the same time as someone staying there, I would beat them to the beach. Other bonuses: free beach gear for borrow, including beach towels, floaties, snorkel gear, boogie boards... and right next door to two great surf / SUP rental stores. Kai Coffee, located in the Hyatt Regency, is great for strong coffee if you're needing something fancy. Plenty of restaurants with anything you could want (and any price range) within a 5 min walk, Foodland is around the corner, Farmer's Market in King's Market on Saturdays, a block away from the mall. The one bummer was the soap / shampoo offered - only in wall dispensers, would have preferred to have more personal items, but I have sensitive skin and brought my own anyway!The value of Stay Hotel Waikiki is unbeatable.

I guess we chose the stay hotel based on its affordability. It is advertised as a budget hotel! Initially, when we arrived in 806 we were thinking 'where is our hand chair' ! To be fair, it was a basic room (not boutique?) but was absolutely spotless and we had house keeping daily! Renovations are happening I imagine 1 floor at a time. Our little dated room grew on us very quickly! The air con is a bit of a pain in the derrière - right next to the bed in line with where you sleep!! So air con was a day time luxury only. We had absolutely no access to wifi in our room which seemingly is a working progress in the hotel. The front desk were a nice bunch. Specifically, I would like to mention Lilly. She was extremely approachable and really excellent at her job. She clearly cared about the people in the hotel and was focussed on ensuring folks had a great stay. ? Management - maybe a promotion or raise !? If not recognizing her work would be great !!!!! Overall, you pay for what you get. If you want four or five stars don't chose this hotel.

The staff had me reset my phone and only in the lobby did the wifi worked. My room was 805 and it's an inconvenience to go downstairs every time to use Internet. Next the wall AC unit is inches from the bed and when we have gone to sleep my wife wakes up the next morning with chills, fever, and diarrhea. I myself by the third day started getting diarrhea from the close proximity of the AC. I had to visit the local ABC store for Advil and an anti-diarrhea medicine. There is little range of motion to the air vents and any way you turn it you will still be directly hit by the air regardless if it's hot or cold. I am certain I have never stayed in a room where the AC unit is that close to your face.Also the TV channels are viewed with a snowy or bad signal look to them so we couldn't enjoy that. Also the wall outlet to the right of the bed doesn't work.Tripadvisor advertises that this hotel had free breakfast and several posted pictures show a continental breakfast. Upon arrival and when asking a staff member her response was dismissive and she stated no that there was no such breakfast. Part of the reason I chose this hotel was expecting that amenity and I wasn't afforded.A vacation that took months and several thousand dollars to make a reality are a bittersweet memory for us which we will not soon forget.",,drtheman,15,1.0

After my friend left, I had one night alone and based on misleading pictures I figured the Stay Hotel would work for me. And the price was right.... Like $99, but I should have known better!!!It's super small, and all doors face outside so anyone can see you come and go and I didn't feel safe. It's not your normal hotel where each floor has an indoor hallway for rooms, so I felt insecure. The lobby is small and sterile, with some little ghetto bar. Once I entered the room, it was all white and concrete so felt like I was in a hospital or jail cell. It was clean, so I'll give them that. But small, impersonal and like a college dorm. The location is good since it's just one block from the beach, but you can do better for sure and have a better experience.If you're some young dudes wanting a cheap place/hostel to stay while you surf, then fine. But within an hour, and after a FaceTime to my husband I decided to walk out!! I know I wouldn't have slept well or enjoyed my last night.They wouldn't refund my money, and there's also a resort fee... For what?? God only knows!!! I walked down the street to the Pacific Beach Hotel and got a room for just $60 more that FAR surpassed the Stay room and had a door you entered from an interior hallway, so I was happy.

We wanted to be in walking distance of Waikiki. A quick search on Trip Advisor and other sites came up with Stay Hotel which had great pictures on their website. For the time of year we were traveling it had lower rates than the bigger places. It appeared to be something like an A-Loft from the pictures. They must have had a fantastic photographer. In the first place signage is so small and hidden by trees you can't find the place. It appeared to be an small, old, apartment building which had been converted into a hotel. The only thing this facility had going for it was its location and it was fairly clean. There was no moldy caulk in the bathrooms, apparently all had been freshly painted, and it was kept clean. However, it was very Spartan. We had a 2 BR suite, which was really nothing but two connected bedrooms. The A/C was cheap window units which did not do a good job of cooling the place off and they were very noisy. The mattress on the cheap platform bed was just a few inches of foam and the support was not good. Linens were clean and apparently new. Flatscreen TV's in each room but poor selection of channels. Parking was supposed to be under the building, but they only had 6 spots and we had to park at another of their properties 2 blocks away. It was endurable as we weren't around during the day and it was essentially just a place to sleep. It was relatively quiet although cramped between two similar buildings that were apparently rental apartments. The facility was too expensive for what you get. As every hotel was essentially booked in the area, even the old Outrigger properties, we were left little choice to get the location. It was a block from Waikiki and you could walk to everything.","Las Vegas, NV","HendersonNVTraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, NV</strong>",17,3.0

When I got to the hotel there was a 25 dollar parking fee which was not noted anywhere when I booked. They charge you a 10 fee for having a small amount of beach items. The room looked nothing like it did on the pictures, it was small, and old looking. The bed covers had stains on them, same with the bath curtain. When I asked to stay an extra two hours because I was getting hair and make up done, they wanted to charge me an extra fee.

The location of the hotel is perfect, just a few minute walk from the beach & very close to the major shopping area & lots of places to eat. The hotel staff are so friendly & helpful, everyone who worked there that we interacted with was so kind & genuine. The hotel was very affordable & had good reviews which is why we chose to stay there. If you're looking for an affordable hotel at a great location this is the place for you, however if you prefer newly renovated fancy hotels this is definitely not the place for you. The hotel is quite old, the lobby is newly renovated but the rooms are very outdated, we didn't mind because it was clean & the beds were comfortable. All though the bathroom was extremely small, you can't wash your face in the sink without getting water all over the floor, there is also only one mirror in the room, which is fine for most people, but if you're two girls traveling together it makes getting ready in a timely fashion quite difficult. The shower is really small and old. The rooms have air conditioning all though it's not very strong, when you first walk in from outside it feels cold but within minutes of being in your room you're very hot again. If you have a car rental it costs $25/day to have your car parked in the hotel underground parking, that may be standard price for most hotels in the area, however I found that to be ridiculous, I'd think hotel parking would be $10 per day at the very most, but unfortunately we had no other options and had to pay $25/day for parking on top of the daily room fee ($10/day) which they charge you at the end of your stay at check out.

We also requested a room with a balcony (no extra cost) and that was a nice place to enjoy your morning coffee (provided free in the hotel lobby, along with a breakfast of pastries, muffins and fruit)!Overall, this hotel is certainly not glamorous, but it is the perfect spot for a young couple looking to travel to beautiful Hawaii on a budget. The staff are great, the location is ideal, and there's tons of stuff within walking distance, so you definitely don't need a car in Waikiki! Although, I certainly highly recommend spending at least half of your trip to Oahu NOT in Waikiki, and renting a car for travelling the rest of the island. There is so much to see (Kualoa Ranch, the North Shore, the much less crowded beaches of north and east coasts) - so enjoy it!","St. John's, Canada","709Stephanie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. John's, Canada</strong>",1,4.0

Having read many of the reviews I appreciate that this hotel does not claim to be 5* and we also chose not to raise of the concerns with management during our stay. There are many positives to this hotel so my average review is purely to highlight the more basic level of accommodation and facilities.I cannot stress how fantastic the staff were. On arrival they were incredibly helpful and remained throughout. However, I think a 4pm check in is quite late. This was also not advised on our confirmation. I also don't agree with the compulsory charge for extras. I would suggest just putting the price up to cover these ""facilities"" rather than making a big deal over no real benefits. We didn't use the computer / printer in Reception, or read a newspaper. You can't list the newspaper as ""free"" and then charge for it.... The room was very basic and not in line with the photos we saw online. I presume that we had one of the rooms yet to be upgraded as both rooms either side were in the progress of being upgraded. I know this as the people working on the room were singing and shouting at 7am. Perhaps they thought they were in the karaoke bar which is part of the hotel on the ground floor...Don't let the karaoke bar put you off. The noise didn't disturb us (we were on the 7th floor) and the staff the in bar are also great fun. It's a cool little bar and we had some good nights in there. Our room wasn't small but it was very noisy due to the slated glass windows. The aircon unit was next to the bed and at the same height so it was impossible to have this on during the night unless you wanted a frozen face. It was also very noisy. Overall the room was just very very basic. The curtains on a bit of string and there are plastic/cardboard cups and no other utensils so almost pointless having a microwave oven. We were only there to sleep though but unfortunately it wasn't even the best night sleep mainly due to the noise and the heat. I suppose you get what you pay for and unfortunately in Hawaii the prices are already high everywhere else so this place was value for money.As I said at the beginning, I didn't raise these concerns so I'm sure the staff would have been very helpful to do what they can but in all honesty, I almost wish I didn't need to raise any of these issues as no matter how basic, they still shouldn't be issues in the first place.","London, United Kingdom","DavidBish</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",13,3.0

That was not the case. Instead the woman tells us they don't have a room available at their hotel because it's over booked! But they are going to give us a bigger room at their other hotel. Which she said was just across the street. When the young man carried our luggage through the back, past the laundry down some stairs and across the back lane where he pointed to an iron gate and told us, its over there and didn't seem like he was going to walk any further with the heavy luggage. Well, then things went sideways after that! My Man said ""Stop that's it were going back!"" So we crossed the lane again and went up some stairs past two women doing the laundry and back to the reception. We were not impressed to say the least This was not acceptable and we were ready to leave.Then the young man who had carried the luggage got on the computer and found us a room on the 3rd floor of their hotel. Imagine that! So with hesitation we decided to take a look at it since we only needed the room for one night. So we decided to stay. The next day, at check out they told us there was a mandatory fee for the hospitality services, breakfast, coffee, internet and floats for the beach that we didn't use.I looked at the girl, which was the same girl from the day before and said You can wave the fee because there was no hospitality and no service. So she said she would have to ask her manager and would be right back. When she came back 2 minutes later, she said her manager was in a meeting but she had the authority to wave the fee. Oh really? That was so nice of her. While waiting in the reception area for our ride, the manger of the hotel came out to apologize and explain to us that the room in the back alley was really an upgrade if we had taken a look. She was very nice. but a little too late. I don't feel this hotel is even worth 100 dollars.

See Cons)- Free beach towels for the day- Air-conditioned room via window unit- Small balcony- Great showerhead- Free WiFiCons:- About 10 parking spaces under the hotel in garage for small vehicles at a steep price of $25 a day.- I can't speak for what other rooms looked like, but ours (room #804) was 8'x9'-- EXTREMELY small. Only one person could stand in the bathroom at a time and if you sit down on the toilet, your face was pretty much over the sink.

None of the pictures online showed this small of a room.- Bring your earplugs, as you can pretty much hear everything going on downtown since the bathrooms have slatted windows that don't really seal out any noise and carry into your room.Overall, this hotel reminded me of a small hostel and is only a place to lay your head at night. We spent most of the time at beaches and purposely ""Stay""ed away from the hotel because our room was sooo tiny. The saving grace for Stay Hotel was the staff. They were very friendly and kind.

I travelled to Hawaii because I'm the biggest fan of the TV show ""Hawaii Five-0"" and wanted to visit the home of my favorite show and cast - but didn't have a lot of money to spend. I booked the hotel through expedia.de and got the 'Deal of the Day' with a great price :)You should not expect a luxury resort or very large rooms but the Stay Hotel definitely offers best value for reasonable prices. The room was clean, had a balcony, large TV, coffee-machine, microwave and refrigerator etc. and, thus, met all my needs perfectly. In the hotel lobby, there were couches and a large TV screen, two computers (that I used regularly), a snack and beverage vending machine, book-shelf and an ATM - which also worked for ec/Maestro cards).There was even a small breakfast snack pack included (1 small muffin, 1 small bagel, 1 orange or apple) and coffee which you could pick up in the lobby each morning.What stood out the most was the super-friendly staff (front-desk and housekeeping) and the perfect location in the heart of Waikiki. There were shops and restaurants all around (incl. fast-food places, ABC stores for groceries etc. and the King's village with a small farmers market three nights per week from 4-9 p.m.). The bus and trolley stops were all within walking distance (1-3 minutes) and, of course, the beach was also just a 1-minute walk away and offered best views of the sunset every night.If I make it back to Hawai'i (which I hope) from Germany some day, I will definitely stay at the Stay Hotel again.","Munich, Germany","angelagerstner</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Munich, Germany</strong>",0,5.0

We booked here as we wanted a two bedroom apartment that was in a good location. Stay came up and when compared to the other options with vacancy at the time we needed, the rates were much better than the rest.We turned up and it looked a little dated but the reception area seemed revamped and tidy. We were placed in a room on the first floor - it had a bedroom to the right and then the main living area had a couch & the second bed. The room was unfortunately warm due to a) the glass venetian style windows and b) the location of the air conditioner (just off the floor in the corner). There was an ABC store on the next corner and it was just one block to waikiki beach. All seemed well.The first night is when it all unfolded. Turns out the room was directly above Wang Chungs and there was no sound proofing whatsoever. It was loud. Not just loud, but the floor vibrated from the bass. It got worse as the night went on and all the drunken karaoke singers began shouting into the microphone. To make things worse, the first bedroom was right on the main thoroughfare to all the rooms and had the same glass venetian windows. The noise from the traffic was compounded by the lights in the hall & from the building next door which was very close, making it almost impossible to sleep. The room remained lit up the entire evening.We raised the issue the next morning and we were brushed off saying they had no control over Wang Chung. When asked to be moved, even into two separate single rooms, we were declined and told it wouldn't happen. The ""best"" they could do was waive the amenity fee for one day and if we wanted to complain again, they could ""ask"" WC to turn their music down. Even ear plugs didn't make a big difference.We only got sleep two nights of the stay - they were the two nights we ended up inebriated enough that falling asleep was inevitable. We cancelled our second stay and I would strongly recommend that you consider very carefully whether light & sound until ~2am is something you can withstand (night after night) before booking your stay here.",,simonbQ759WR,0,1.0

It lacked a desk or even chairs (except for a fairly cheap set on the balcony) and the bathroom was one of the smallest I've ever used--but it DID have a very nice shower. Despite this, I ended up really enjoying my stay. Why? It is ONE BLOCK from the beach. Nestled in the middle of a number of larger (and more expensive) hotels, Stay Hotel Waikiki put me right in the middle of Waikiki beach on a budget. And the 24 hour service at the desk down front had answers for all sorts of questions--they helped me figure what bus to take (I had no car) to get to all sorts of destinations, ideas on how to spend my day, and even held my key so that I could go for a swim one morning (I was traveling by myself). The Karaoke bar on the ground floor, Wang Chung's, is a fun way to spend the evening on a weekend, too. The room seemed a little less clean than I would have expected, but I found I was tracking lots of sand in. Despite this, the maid service was very diligent and I found the room well kept whenever I returned in the afternoon. While it may feel a bit rough for a full family or someone on a business trip, for young adults who will spend little time in their rooms, it's very good!

I pre booked and paid online for one nights accommodation due to an oversight on my behalf with another hotel , leaving me without accommodation for that night . On arrival to STAY HOTEL WAIKIKI , I was asked for my credit card details , I was curious as to why and was informed that there was a 50 USD fee as a security bond (not completely unusual however the surprise was a little annoying ) a 11USD utility fee to cover beach towels and pool equipment .... Please note there is no pool on this site so I'm a little confused why this fee was a compulsory fee at all, given coffee and tea facilities are normally provided in the overall cost of paying for accommodation at any other hotel, motel or resort . And the third fee was 25USD for parking for the day . Now after they deducted the additional funds of nearly 90 USD i was provided with my room key and was utterly shocked in the state of the room , I wasn't expecting anything fancy and I've never felt compelled to write a review before but here I am .... Mold on the blinds and curtains , unknown hair on linen and the coffee machine was already clogged with an old coffee bag witch just showed the level of cleanliness of the room , overall I stayed the night feeling dirty and ripped off ..

The location of Stay is fantastic, and so is the service, but other things could do with some improvements.As I mentioned, the location of this place is terrific. Merely steps from the beach, and major bus lines are located just moments away. The staff is super friendly and helpful. However, keep your expectations for everything else in check. When you arrive at Honolulu International, what is your first impression? Mine was, ""wow, this is an old airport"". I'd have to say that goes for a lot of the hotels on Waikiki as well, as it seems a lot were built probably 40 years ago or so. Stay Waikiki suffers from the same problems, it is an old building. So if you are looking for something newer, you will likely have to look elsewhere.We were on the 8th floor during our stay (which is the top floor). Our room pleasantly looked nothing like the pictures, so it did not have the tiling you see in some of the photos, but some sort of snap together flooring that resembled carpets. Not exactly sure what the proper terminology is for it, but it is better than tile.Our bed was soft and welcoming after a day of travel, but too soft towards the middle. It could definitely use some extra support. We did not have a headboard. The room also lacks a full mirror which my wife found frustrating.The washroom is where the building shows it's age. However, old doesn't mean bad, just worn. It seemed clean enough, so no complaints about it from us.We did have an incident with a small lizard (it certainly wasn't a bug) climbing around our ceiling, but it was easy enough to harmlessly guide outside. One of the perks, I suppose of a tropical environment.I will say you can expect to be woken up in the early hours of the morning when the garbage truck makes it's rounds. The windows are slatted (I don't know the term for this style of window) so it's not exactly noise proof. I'd imagine staying on anything lower than the 6th floor would make for a much nosier stay. Bring earplugs for sure. There is also a Karaokee bar which can cause some noise at night, but was not discernible to our ears on the 8th floor.We were charged an amenity fee for the breakfast/wifi which was separate from the hotel fees. I forget the amount but I believe it is $10 a day. Breakfast consisted of a muffin, a mini bread and a piece of fruit. Coffee is also available. Parking clocks in at $25 a night in the convenient underground parking, but I think there are only 16 stalls. If it is full, you may need to park elsewhere.Our room had a mini fridge and a microwave as well. It would be extra nice if the hotel provided slippers for the guests for each room though (especially considering the number of Asian tourists that visit).Overall it was a positive visit and the location cannot be beat. Beach towels and flotation devices are also complementary. Anything you are lacking can also be picked up at the ABC store a couple doors down. Also, a big thank you to the helpful staff who helped make our stay pleasant.Mahalo!","Vancouver, Canada","mbyun</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",4,3.0

Or else you will have one hell of a time falling and keeping asleep. Tour buses frequent this street due to its location and the jealousy windows which provide little noise reduction on top of that you will hear very often slamming of doors on and around the 3rd floor.

The water pressure from the shower was weak at best, which made it difficult to shower. Also the hot water would fade in and out, so there was a drizzle of cold water every few minutes. The Wifi didn't work most of the time, and the TV channel selection didn't include any national news channels (which was probably good). Other than those few things the hotel was not bad and like I said the staff was friendly and helpful, Great ALOHA spirit! Anyway, you're in Hawaii so why stay in the hotel room? Go to the beach! The hotel staff did explain that they were going through renovations. I hope the next time we stay there these issues are taken care of. That would make this hotel an excellent value.",,Jseven808,0,3.0

The room was nice and bright and colourful and comfortable enough for our stay. It did get ridiculously hot in the room and the air conditioner was quite small and needed to be on ALL DAY to keep the room comfortable enough to stay in.Unfortunately for us, the windows of the room were a shutter style and therefore didn't close properly. They let a lot of noise in from the back street and the windows let in a lot of light. I'd probably recommend to request a room at the front of the property as the noise on the backstreet can get quite loud... Please note... Whilst the location is pretty awesome and the beach is a stone's throw away... the streets heading away from the beach can be quite rough at night... Just be on your guard. There are a few ladies of the night floating around as well.There is a fun Karaoke bar downstairs and the hotel provides breakfast... Health freaks won't be happy as it is mainly cake style pastries and toast with jellies (very sugary jam-like spreads) Didn't rate the breakfast highly, but it was free and was OK for a few days. You'll probably want to have something different after a few days so I recommend... If you're on a budget, head to the ABC store up the street (there is one on every corner) and buy yourself a yoghurt and museli bowl for a few dollars and a juice... or if you can splurge, go to one of the many cafes and restaurants in the area. They also sell granola bars, sandwiches, salads and everything else you need (including alcohol and munchies)There is free wifi at the hotel which is great for uploading your favourite holiday snaps and there is an internet cafe for printing and surfing the web.Downsides of this hotel were: Cleaning of the rooms wasn't consistent. You generally should leave a few bucks tip on the bed for the cleaners... but every day they were pretty inconsistent... A few times they left the floor sandy or didn't make the bed or replace toiletries... but I guess this happens from time to time. There is no pool, but you don't really need one with the beach across the street.All in all, it was pretty comfortable and I would probably stay here again. The feel was more like a upmarket backpackers with private rooms. Majority of guests were young adults 20-30's and party goers. Probably wouldn't recommend for older couples as the creature comforts are minimal... But if you're after a comfortable room to share with your partner, close to the beach and walking distance to everything fun... whilst not spending a fortune... this place is for you!","Sydney, Australia","Jojo_Colt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",16,3.0

At first, I wasn't very happy with my room. It was dark with one tiny window and I wasn't crazy about the cell block walls. The front desk staff at the time were very easy going with accommodating me with a nicer room on an upper floor (6th thru 8th floors have lanai balconies). The room was very clean, bed was comfy, lanai was perfect, and the AC made the cutely decorated room feel nice and cool. After having such a nice experience, I decided to spend my birthday this past Feb 2016 again at the Stay, with my boyfriend. Tanya was extremely helpful over the phone with helping me reserve the same room, 4 years later! Kudos to her :)The hotel is located one short block from the beach and an ABC store is conveniently located right on the corner. The hotel has parking, gives beach towels, and provides little pastries for breakfast. The wifi was a little spotty in the room, but after notifying the front desk, they were able to fix it and had no issues after that.Even though we spent most of our time on the beach, we always came back to our room cleaned and towels replaced. The mini fridge was a big plus and I loved that it was always quiet at night.Big, big, THANK YOU to Jayar for allowing us to check out one hour after normal check out time on our last day. We really appreciate you holding our luggage after check out and especially for keeping our lei's in your refrigerator! You're the best!I definitely recommend staying at this boutique hotel!

Trash trucks busses from the neighboring hotel. If your a light sleeper or wanna sleep in this will not work. Also the bar downstairs plays music till230am and it's loud. This could be that we were on the 2nd floor right above the bar practically. The bed is super stiff because it is low to the ground set directly on plywood.Parking- the $25 daily fee is crazy!!! If your lucky you can park in a few spots on he same street. If not, do like we did and park by the park by the beach. It's about a 5 min walk and it's free. There are plenty of little spots to park around the hotel. If you want the added security then pay. There are some shady people going in and out at times I think due to the rate but if you use the room to sleep and shower it will work. It truly is a awesome location.

However, it was the cheapest hotel I could find around the area so I thought it would still be okay even if it's not as great as we thought. Guess what? It turned out great!Our experience went from 3 out of 10 to 9 out of 10 because of the friendly staff there who really tried to accommodate to our needs and made sure our stay was as pleasant as possible. Initially, I booked two separate rooms for 4 of us, and the rooms were located on the 6th floor. The surprise? Elevator was out of order and has not been working for a week. My mom, who is in her 60's, almost had a heart attack before she reached 4th floor and that's when we decided this is not going to work. Long story short, the staff was kindly enough to find us two vacant condos (across the street) on 1st and 2nd floor AND let us stay there at no extra cost. This was the nicest thing they've done for my mom and I really appreciate their hospitality and thoughtfulness. Especially after the fact that there were two gentlemen carrying all our luggage all around the hotel. The location was great! We were close to everything. Beach, farmer's market, Waikiki trolley stops, shopping centers, food, bus stops...etc.The only down side was the noise. The windows don't close and I guess Hawaiians start their days around 4 or 5 am. You can hear the trucks going through, trash bins being dumped, and etc etc. If you are a light sleeper, I strongly recommend ear plugs.Overall speaking, we had a very pleasant stay and we would definitely come back again the next time we travel to Waikiki.","Los Angeles, California","Leah L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",0,4.0

The room stays lit up at night due to street lights even with the makeshift curtains closed. No elevator at this hotel if that's important to you. No onsite parking available. My wife and I found a parking garage a couple blocks away for $40 and since we pack light and enjoy exercise, this was not to big of an issue although onsite parking is a nice feature to have. There is a nightclub onsite with karaoke playing late into the night. Nice option if you are down to party but not if you're into getting some restful sleep. The proximity to the beach, nightlife, restaurants, and shopping was about the same distance we had to walk to the parking garage. Only a couple blocks away, so pretty close.

The absolutely hands-down best thing about this hotel is that it is right in Waikiki, literally a block away from the Waikiki beach & Kalakaua Ave that has all the shops, restaurants, & the huge shopping plazas, all while being less than a third of the price of the giant Hyatt across the street from it. I had realistic expectations when booking this hotel that with the rate we were at & considering its location in Hawaii (which is expensive as it is), so I was not expecting a huge lofty, luxurious room, nor did the photos reflect that the rooms had much space.. so, it definitely met my expectations. You have to keep in mind that the photos by management are going to be the most flattering photos of the place, so of course it's not perfect, but it is renovated & trendy. Our room was on the top floor, with a small view of the ocean. I think the higher up you go, the less of a problem the noise is. Currently, the windows in the rooms are not solid panes of glass, they're slats that allow a lot of noise (& heat) in, but I've seen that management will be replacing those & I think that'll be a major improvement soon! honestly though, we kept the air unit running & kept the blinds & slats closed and our room was just fine. Bearing in mind that this is a city, the noise truly wasn't that bad. my husband and I both got good nights sleep for the week that we were there. my husband was obsessed with the local pastries offered for breakfast & we even checked out the karaoke bar in the lobby, which was a lot of fun! also, it's important for me to acknowledge how awesome their staff is. they are all so friendly & accommodating. Housekeeping staff is also very friendly and my room was always cleaned. management did a great job in staffing! bottom line, we saved a lot of money by staying here & had a pleasant time! we will be staying here again whenever we visit this side of Oahu again!

The actual lighting inside the room wasn't the greatest, rather dim and no bedside lamps.The front desk staff were friendly and helpful... we wanted to check in quite early and were given the option to upgrade our room to something bigger and get early check in, this incurred a fee of around $20/night, but as we got the original room at a good price, this was acceptable for us. It's also important to mention the ""amenity fee"", this is a $10/person fee that is, if I remember correctly, mandatory, and includes such amenities as wifi, continental breakfast, etc. Would be nice if this wasn't sprung upon you at check in, but as it was only 2 of us, we weren't terribly bothered, it would be nice if they just increased prices slightly perhaps and included it, instead of a separate charge. Also important to know that in rooms that are on the outside of the building, ie with outside facing windows, it can get very noisy, especially early on. This is partially due to the fact that the windows are what I would call ""shutter style"" (not sure if thats the actual name or not), therefore they shut, but are like shutters in that there are gaps between all the panes. Only small gaps mind you, but this doesn't help the noise situation. We were severely jet-lagged though, so waking up early was okay as it helped with resetting our clocks a bit. But this is a noisy hotel, windows aside, as it is located right near the main Waikiki area/beach and with garbage trucks and construction going on, it's not the quietest place. Overall, this was a great short term stay, great staff, convenient location, clean rooms, etc. Long term it wouldn't be my first choice, simply because of noise, which is ultimately beyond their control (short of sound-proofing their windows). Continental breakfast was as expected, the croissants and roll things were quite nice.","Gateshead, United Kingdom","ericaecho</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gateshead, United Kingdom</strong>",31,4.0

Especially when considering the age of the building.Front desk. Pleasant and engaging staff.Location. Two blocks from the beach, shopping, and dining options.CONS: Noise. The windows in many rooms are like glass blinds, a style that is common in Hawaii. They provide little noise insulation, so we were awoken by our boisterous neighbors and loud crashing noises in the adjacent alley throughout the night.Amenities fee. We were surprised to have to pay an additional $10 fee when checking in. This was not mentioned when we booked and paid for the room by credit card online (via hotels[dot]com).Parking garage. It's small and was completely full when we arrived. Had to park at a different hotel about three blocks away ($25).Disrepair. The floor lamp and some of the turn-key devices on the blind-style windows were either broken or not working properly.Fridge. There isn't one.OVERALL:Clean, sparse room in a decent location that would likely be attractive to small groups of friends looking for shopping, beach time, and partying (perhaps in the karaoke bar on the first floor).Due to a last-minute schedule change, we had to book an extra night in Waikiki and thought we were getting a deal when Stay Hotel was advertised as 50% off the regular rate.

I can't imagine trying to write a review if I had payed full price.The Bad:*If you look at their website, imagery is not reflective of the facilities...those pictures are like a science fiction movie so do not expect your room to look as nice.*Although the linens and towels were clean, the rest of the room didn't feel properly clean. Dirty windows, rusted drapes, there was hair in the bathroom wall and old dirt above the bathroom tile.*Furniture in disrepair*Paper thin pillows*Waking up to the sound of the trash trucks in the morning and the beeping of deliveries to nearby businesses as early as 530am due to lack of proper windows.Appreciated even though not used:*Continental breakfast (people seemed to enjoy but then again most would go for the free stuff and appear to be happy with it just because is free)There is a karaoke establishment in the lobby that didn't bother me, however if there is going to be such establishment in the lobby management should look at ways to monitor the elevator which anyone can get to at anytime, no questions asked.I guess I appreciate receiving an email from the General Manager overnight on departure date asking for feedback. However and especially given the condition of this hotel, I would suggest you are more visible in your operation, introduce yourself to people, see what your staff is doing or not doing. Maybe instead of sitting at the desk all day doing nothing they can help you compose an inspection sheet that addresses your most common and fixable complaints that don't require ""renovating"". Why leave it up to your paying guests to tell you at the end of their stay what they thought and then apologize saying the hotel will be refurbished and that you wish we told you while we were there to see what you could do? Perhaps you need to start walking the rooms and corridors of your hotel and addressing the simple things that can truly make a difference. See that the rooms are properly cleaned, that maintenance is looking at shower heads that fall when you turn on the water to prevent this to happen to a guest like it happened to me. This questions may remain unanswered, and constructive suggestions and feedback ignored but in the end I've done my part, paid for my stay and given you the feedback you requested.To the readers of this review and potential guests: Stay ""elsewhere"" Waikiki.","Henderson, Nevada","romazzino</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Henderson, Nevada</strong>",201,1.0

Upon arrival we could see it basically looks just like the lobby for a hostel, even with the entrance to a karaoke bar not far from front desk. We made our way to our room and realized it only got worse, the elevator tried to hurt us a few times (gives you 4 seconds to get in then shuts), the light outside of the elevator door on the second floor was burnt out making it dark and sketchy since the halls are outside. Our room which was on the front side of the second floor was ok when we first arrived, but after spending some time in there we realized some things: I didn't have a light next to my single bed, but there was a plug there labelled 'floor lamp', the TV remote did not work, the blinds were filthy, so I opened them to see the dirty shutters, and bad view, the shower is basically a coffin, I am claustrophobic so I could not spend long in it, and the worst part, which was there were no real windows just shutters, nothing to shut to drown out the street noise, so we tried to do this with the A/C.. Neither my mom or I slept much the one night we were able to stay (out of our 6 reserved nights). I was woken up for good at about 4am when the deliveries and dumpster emptying started. I know we were on the front street but it felt like it was all happening in our room. We also heard the doors in the other rooms slamming all night, as well as the bar crowd coming and going. My mom did not sleep at all as she jumped at every noise, and thought about how she didn't feel safe staying there after I left a few days later. at 4:30am we started reading the reviews, which we really should have done when booking, and saw that we were not alone. We then started looking for deals on hotels.com for other hotels and found really nice ones for $120/night, where we were paying $200/night to stay at Stay, so we decided to move hotels and cancel our remaining days there since even if the issues were rectified, and we moved to a higher floor, we still didn't want to stay due to the lack of value, and not feeling comfortable there.I know we booked it a long time ago when peak rates were listed, and we managed to luck out with a last minute deal ($140/night at Aqua Skyline with 2 very comfortable and clean queen sized beds, doors and windows that shut, a pool and an amazing view), but I don't think $200/night is acceptable for a room of that quality, with 2 single beds in it, at any time of year. The front desk lady was really nice and helped us check-out smoothly. We did not mention why we were leaving as we didn't want any offers to move rooms, we just wanted to leave. I would say the only thing going for this hotel is the location, and I would recommend it for backpackers, or young people who plan to just pass out there after a night of partying, rather than to get a good night's sleep. I see the manager plans to upgrade the windows, which would help a lot, but in the mean time I would definitely not recommend it for older people or families with young kids.","Dumfries, United Kingdom","shonas766</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dumfries, United Kingdom</strong>",2,1.0

This means ZERO noise protection, which makes you feel like you're sleeping in the street. Partygoers and loud drunks until late at night (weekends - 4am), especially since the first floor has a karaoke bar. And construction noises from 8am (building a new hotel next to it).2) Old - The rooms themselves are old and poorly renovated. Especially the bathroom. Also the fact that I didn't have a chair or a proper desk in my room was very annoying.3) Extremely Greedy Pricing - I know that it's high season (end of year), but paying ~$450/night was simply an act of greed. This is the kind of room I would feel bad paying $90/night for (unfortunately, I didn't have much choice - it was either staying in this hotel or sleeping in street, which noise-wise, didn't feel much different).","Tel Aviv, Israel","YB84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tel Aviv, Israel</strong>",18,1.0

The sofa bed was a folded out futon type with a very hard crease in the middle and totally impossible to sleep on. The vent in the bathroom would not close all the way so hot air was coming in the bathroom so we had to keep the bathroom door shut to keep the hot air out. The rest of the room didn't even have a chair to sit on and the air conditioner was totally inadequate to get or keep the room cool. I complained to the desk clerk and nothing really changed. It would have taken a lot of paperwork and extra time to change hotels so we didn't change. The picture on the internet does not adequate portray how old the hotel really is.

I is right smack dab in the the heart of Waikiki and is only about 10 min away from the Royal Hawaiian Center where there are many shops and restaurants. They even have a center stage where entertainment is free for your enjoyment! No you could pay a higher priced hotel to see the same thing but let's face it... if your on a business trip like me, and you need to take your clients out to dinner or meet some friends, then the best place to stay in Waikiki is the STAY WAIKIKI HOTEL!! The rooms are clean and comfortable and the location is perfect!! They even have a bar in the lobby with Karaoke so you and your friends can hang out and relax!! Make your reservations today!!

The location of the hotel is literally a block away from the beach and some amazing restaurants. Everything was within walking distance. The ladies at the front desk were super nice and helpful, giving us numerous tips on places to go and eat. The room was nice too! Small, but exactly what we paid for. For the price we paid, this place was perfect. I would definitely stay here for my next Hawaiian trip. However, no review is complete without some of the negatives. Apparently, this hotel brought in a karaoke bar a few months before we got there. We never went in, since karaoke isn't my thing, but at night it gets really loud. I sleep like a bear, so I wasn't bothered. But my friend said every morning how loud it was and that is was difficult for him to sleep. I even talked to a girl that lived in the apartments next door and she said she could hear them! Also, it didn't bug me much, but we had a couple cockroaches in the hotel. The hotel tried to come in and spray the room, but we had just gotten back from a hike and weren't planning on leaving, so they said they would do it another day. Overall, the location, price, and service beats out the noise and bug problems.",,featherandria,0,4.0

It got a little loud Friday night when patrons were leaving the bar.

It looks cleaner, brighter, more stylish and contemporary than what it actually is.When I arrived about 11:45pm I didn't feel safe at all. The foyer is run down, there was a security guard sitting there just 'hanging around' and when I went to check in, the guy checking me in seemed like he would rather be somewhere else. To add to that I then find out there was a mix up with room bookings. Eventually got to my room, however it was completely dark on the landing outside my door, the light-switch inside the room didn't work and it wasn't at all something welcoming or inviting for guests who had travelled a long way.To add to that - I booked and paid in advance so I won't have any extra 'hidden' surprises and then I find out there is an extra $10 per night (which they take out of my bond, no choice) for the breakfast (which I didn't eat and the wifi - which was advertised as free). Given I'm not a breakfast person and I could lived without the wifi, it would have been nice to not have to pay for something that I didn't use.The lady on the front desk the next couple of days was friendly which was a bonus - but overall as a solo female traveller, I wouldn't recommend it. It just didn't feel safe.Also - there was no instructions in the room on how to use anything and I missed an activity on my last day as there was a message left on my room phone changing the time but I didn't know how to retrieve it, therefore missed the connection. Wasn't amused.All in all I wouldn't recommend it as a place to stay. Next time I will be heading across the road and paying a mere few dollars more to stay at the Hyatt Regency or somewhere else. The manager will probably say I should have told them at the time, but to be honest, I didn't feel they were approachable enough to want to hear the feedback, considering when I checked in and questioned the extra charges the guy was pretty uptight and defensive.","Wellington, New Zealand","Shamrocknz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",4,3.0

The location was great, it was a tiny block away from the beach. You could find everything around that area, and the bus stops were about a block or two away as well. If you went on tours they usually picked you up in the hotel right in front of it as well. The hotel itself wasn't very clean though, there were bugs around the room which I hated and the shower was a bit dirty. The windows were pretty old so they let a lot of noise in, and I mean A LOT. There was wi-fi available but I got pretty bad service from our room, so we mostly went downstairs to use the computers they had in the lounge area. I had been told they had a pool, so I was very disappointed finding out they did not. The staff was very friendly though.

First, we arrived a little early, about 140 and check in was not till 4. Our room wasn't ready and it would be a bit till it was. We were attending a wedding and needed to freshen up a bit before. I asked to be called when my room was ready and I would come over and get situated. THE CALL NEVER CAME. Service, zero points. We had to get ready in another hotel. The location was good, one block from the beach, no ocean view though. While the street the hotel is on is close to mainstream Waikiki, it did seem to be in a seedier area with a hostel next door and those hanger around types just hanging around. We finally came back close to 11 at night and found there would be an additional 11 per night as a ""RESORT FEE"". Now, I use the term RESORT in its loosest sense. This was to pay for the ""breakfast"" which was served in the lobby area from 7 til 930 am. Thawed pastries, toast, cold cereal and yogurt. Eat to your heart's content.The lobby looked as though they tried to polish a turd. But, it's still a TURD. There was a single elevator and we waited for a long while for it to come. I think someone pressed all of the buttons and got off. That's the kind of element we found to be staying here. The room was ""polished"" as well. Initially we thought there wasn't a shower in the room. We eventually found it when we closed the bathroom door. The water pressure was great though. The bed was platform style and the room air conditioner was running when we entered which took away from the crazy heat and humidity of the exposed corridors. I hope people are listening to the reviews that are on here. I am usually optimistic and take the good ones into consideration, but in this case I should have read the negative ones as well. This place is NOT 3 STARS. THIS HOTEL IS A 1 STAR LOCATION DISGUISED AS A 3 STAR. The restaurant is under renovation, the service is substandard and the accommodations are basically a dump. Here's the scoop: if you want a place to sleep, don't care about service or amenities, and don't plan on being in the room at all, this place would be enough. But, if you want comfort and service, do not stay here. ","Waipahu, Hawaii","808PeteD808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waipahu, Hawaii</strong>",40,1.0

Stay is great and really good value for money. Stayed at Stay Waikiki as a couple for three nights at the end of June. Was a tad apprehensive before we arrived as I'd read the mixed reviews. However I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed in room 706 which is a a queen standard room. Our flight landed very early in the morning and we went to the hotel to drop our bags, already aware that we were way too early to check in. We returned about midday expecting to just hang out I the lounge area till 4pm but we're told our room was ready. I must mention Jasmine who works on the front desk, as she was incredibly helpful and friendly throughout our stay. Room itself was simple (this clearly isn't the Ritz) but had everything it needed. We had a balcony with partial sea views. Bed was comfortable, bathroom a good size with a full size bath. All of it was clean on arrival and the daily maid service was great. Flat screen TV, iPod Dock and excellent air con, which I didn't find particularly noisy despite other reviewers saying so. I had no trouble sleeping there at all due to noise, but should mention that the Sway Restaurant/bar was closed for renovation whilst we were there, so this may contribute to night time noise at other times.The location of Stay is amazing. Just a hop skip and a jump to Waikiki beach front.The breakfast was average and that's the best I can say about it. Not bad but not good. The free wifi and media centre were really great, and we had no problems connecting to the wifi even up on the 7th floorAll in all it's great value for the money you pay. If you want luxury then go to the Royal Hawaiian and stay there. And look at you room. A lot.

You will not find a more cost-efficient hotel in Waikiki. The bed was comfy, the staff was amazing, the breakfast is decent, and you are ONE BLOCK from the beach. I had friends staying in hotels on the beach, paying $400 a night for a tiny room. With my Hotwire discount, I paid 1/4 of that, including the amenity fee, for a large queen room with a small balcony. And it comes with really delicious mini croissants in the morning (are those from Costco, or what?).Let me address some of the complaints from other reviews:--Room size: Mine was great, but anyone complaining about a small room: go outside, you're in Hawaii. --Cockroaches: Apparently my boyfriend did see one cockroach in the bathroom. That being said, I saw one at a Starbucks, a couple on the beach, and one in the driveway of a very swanky hotel. It is what it is.--Noise: I didn't notice any noise, but I live in a very busy part of a large city most of the year. And there is noise everywhere in Waikiki anyway.--A/C: It doesn't matter where you stay, the A/C is ""inadequate."" It's comfortable for sleeping and lounging, but you're going to need to let your hair air dry (though, they have GREAT hair dryers for a hotel). The swanky hotels' rooms feel just as hot when you're getting ready. If you want cooler, go to a different part of Hawaii.--Breakfast: As you know, I really enjoyed the mini croissants.

Many of the glass louver windows were ""frozen."" some open and none could be fully closed so outside noise and humidity came with the room. We had no fridge nor coffee pot. The single elevator chattered to a stop and the doors were aggressive and the safety baffles didn't react quickly enough to stop one from being bumped around a bit by the closing doors.

We noted no breakfast facility on the premises and none came with our room, but there are convenience stores and other options all over the area.

Great location. But other than that, not a very nice place. I will try to not to make this as long as it should be. But I was intended to be here for 5 nights. I landed at Honolulu airport and before getting to far, I had a heart attack. I spent 3 nights in the hospital, I had to stay the 5 nights because it was a package deal. So got released from the hospital to a few days of recovery and then the nightmare started. I got to the hotel and found that the parking garage was one story under ground. I cannot lift anything over 10 pounds, so I stop before entering the garage and let the lobby know what was going on, the kid working did take my bag, but i had a heavy briefcase also. I had to go park down in the parking lot to find out no elevator to the lobby. Stairs were not real easy, but made it to the lobby. Got my room, no ask if I needed any help getting to my room, but rolled my way to the elevator to the 8th floor. Went in to a small, old but looked ok room. I sat on the bed, and it began. A roach ran across the bed, ok expected...in Hawaii, they have roaches. As night fell upon the room, the roaches started to come out of everywhere. About 10PM I called the front dest and the girl said I'm sorry but I don't have any other room. I asked for some spray and she said they were going to have the Hotel sprayed tomorrow. OK, left it at that. Had to leave every light in the place on all night long and lay there watching the roaches circle the room. Not a nice restfull place to be after a heart attack. I made it through the night. I had one more night, not sure what to do, more hassle to move to another hotel at that point with no help. So I stayed another night. They did come to spray and I told the guy about the night before, it was like no big deal... we have roaches here is all he said. I twas a little better the next night after spraying, I only killed 7, and again had the lights on all night...no rest. Upon check out I said is it possible to waive the parking fee of 25 dollars a night since i had so many roaches in my room, plus I never moved the car the whole time I was there...remember I just had a heart attack.... She said she cannot do that. I said why, she just said she can't nut she will take $20.00 of the resort fee. WOW! $20.00...I could not get out of here soon enough. This was the worst trip to Hawaii anyone can ask for, when you are better off in the hospital, than your hotel. Very upset with this hotel.

I think reading all those bad reviews helped though so I went in with low expectations.When we arrived, we got room 505 I believe, and it was actually a decent size room with a ""queen"" bed. Their queen bed is smaller than a standard queen bed. I actually quite liked this room because it was quiet and sorta spacious (I read horror stories from other TA reviewers about the room being the size of a prison cell). Unfortunately, the toilet didn't flush so we requested to move rooms. We then moved to room 801, which had a balcony but the room was much smaller, and because it's facing Koa Avenue, it was really noisy at night with buses, garbage trucks, etc. This room was also very bright with a balcony door and a couple windows so we were woken up by the natural light at 6am every morning. Near the end of our stay, I think their pesticides were running low because I saw an ant tribe/family crawling all over the bathroom. The hotel had scheduled pesticide people to come in the day we were checking out.Now, on to the good. The location!! It's literally a 3 minute walk to the beach. And I love all the staff. They are all very friendly and nice. They also provide beach mats in every room (although we are paying for it with our $10 'resort' fee everyday). And of course, the price. I don't think you can find another hotel that's close to the beach at this price.Would I stay here again? Most likely not.But if you are like me and got stuck with this hotel from a hotwire deal, then I would suggest you request a room ending with '05', as it's the quietest and biggest room.Preferably 5th fl and up.","Vancouver, Canada","oh_my_sunshine</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",22,3.0

Little room, cute decor mostly Ikea furniture. Photos on their website was not the room that I stayed in.

I informed the front desk the next morning, they said they would take care of it. Came back the next night only to find more cockroaches running around the walls of my room. I understand it is an older property, and having worked in hotel management myself before, I again kindly told the front desk to please investigate the problem. The clerk was very friendly and apologized for the problem. At the continental breakfast served downstairs I heard some other guests talking about finding bugs in their room as well. I then was offered to move to a room one floor up, to which they were painting the walkways and the smell was so strong I couldn't stand it. It was my last night and didn't want the hassle of finding a new hotel for one night, so I completed my stay. On checkout I informed the front desk of the bug problem, they waived the amenities fee which was appreciated, but they really need to get their bug problem under control.","Orange County, CA","ocnat2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County, CA</strong>",1,3.0

It was a block from the beach so we loved that. Loved even more that each couple had their own bathroom--we don't expect that!To me this place was hostel prices, but hotel living; the only possible exception being the floors are not carpeted, but with all the sand you're tracking in it's frankly better that way.

If there is one bit of feedback...when we were checking out of the hotel, we were going to arrange a shuttle through one of the coupon books. We were told by the front desk that those companies aren't always reliable (and we had experienced that!) and that they recommended a shuttle company that they use that IS reliable. So a little later we called and asked the front desk to arrange this for us as they had offered to do. We called at 3pm. We were at the hotel waiting...and the shuttle never came. When the front desk called, the shuttle said they were full. It kind of seemed to us that perhaps the front desk didn't call to make the reservation (maybe they forgot)...or if this is just another example of the unreliable shuttle companies in Waikiki.

Upon arrival to Honolulu & getting to the hotel was a write off. The shuttle that we took to our hotel took about an hour because of the parade that was happening on the main street of Honolulu, keep in mind that we DID NOT make it to our hotel. The driver advised us when he dropped off a few other people at another hotel that it would probably take another hour for us to even get to our hotel. So we decided to get off the shuttle and walk to our hotel.It was a LONG walk. It was hot, I was hungry and I had a headache. These were definitely not a good combination. A word of advice, it is probably better to catch a taxi at the airport rather than take a shuttle as they have many stops depending on the amount of people they have in the shuttle.As we got to the hotel (finally) to check in, there did not seem to be any issue UNTIL we got to our room. I was NOT pleased with the room we received. It was not a room I had paid for! The room I had paid for had a lanai with a queen size bed. The room was extremely small, bathroom was tiny (could not even fit two people in at the same time) and the closet was not even a closet. The room walls were brick slabs that were painted over with barely any wifi signal because of this. The phone in the room did not even work AND there was not even a lanai. We went with another couple and after seeing their room, I was honestly mortified. Even though their room had two double beds, their room was bigger with a lanai! I was hesitant to book with this hotel because of all the reviews I had read previously. I was honestly worried that the same thing that had happened to another person when I read their review would happen to me... and it did...Since our phone in our room did not work, I went back down to front desk and complained. I told them it was not a room that I had booked for and requested to change rooms. They told me that they were overbooked and did not have any rooms available for me. I requested to speak with the manager but the manager wasn't available so they advised me to speak with the another person in charge the next day. Unfortunately we were stuck with that room for the night. The next morning, I went downstairs and spoke with the person that was in charge at the front desk. I had explained my situation and advised that I was not happy. I told her that I was hesitant to book with them at first because of the reviews I had read but decided that I would give it a try despite the reviews. The girl at the front desk told me that have no rooms available but hopefully should have a room available by the afternoon for me but couldn't say for sure. I had to basically wait until the afternoon to find out. After being out for a few hours, I came back and spoke with the front desk again, except this time, I spoke with the manager. They FINALLY had a room for me and told me that it should be ready in a couple of hours once the person in that room checked out and had the room cleaned. Once the room was ready, we moved our belongings to the room they switched us to and wow! what a difference it was!The room we were placed in had a flat screen TV (not that the other one didn't), a sofa bed, queen size bed, a lanai, a table with two chairs and the room was honestly 2 1/2 times the size of the other room with a bigger bathroom! They even brought up a fridge for us to use. I did not expect them to upgrade us to a room with a sofa bed. At this point I was extremely pleased! I was very happy that the staff was accommodating and understanding. They really went above and beyond to ensure that I was happy. Once again, another trip to Honolulu is booked for this year for Aug/Sept at the SAME HOTEL. This time I ensured to book a deluxe room with a sofa bed and lanai. Despite what had happened in the beginning of my March 2013 trip, my reason for booking the same hotel is because the manager, Earl and the front desk girl, Jasmine were extremely helpful, friendly and accommodating with my dissatisfaction in the beginning. As I said, I felt like they really went above and beyond to make me happy. They also gave us suggestions on things to do and where to go etc. The customer service they provided was very good. The location of the hotel is good, within great walking distance to the beach, the zoo and many shops on Waikiki! I will definitely write another review once I am back from my trip this year!","Richmond, Canada","mluu88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Canada</strong>",0,4.0

It was fine for a couple of nights, but situated between two apartment buildings, with people who party until 4am every night, it was difficult to get some sleep. Walls are thin and at times we a little unsure about our safety. It wasn't awful, but I wouldn't stay here again.

The only thing I would change would be the floors, to me a rug would be nice cause the tile just looks and feels a litle dirty, so we just kept our flip flops on and it was good.","Brentwood, California","Amanda C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brentwood, California</strong>",0,4.0

I felt safe and the staff were very helpful with booking my airport transfers. The room was clean, had A/C and was a block away from Waikiki Beach and the main strip. I really liked the location since it was tucked away on a quieter street away from all the busy tourist areas, but still steps away from great restaurants and the famous beach.My only (small) complaint was the Wi-Fi connection, which was dodgy inside my room. My business is online so this is important to me, but the connection was fine in the lobby and in the restaurant where I got most of my work done. The complimentary breakfast was pretty mediocre, but you'll find healthy and delicious options almost anywhere near the hotel. For the price and location, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't need all the fancy amenities of the big expensive hotels and just needs a place to sleep after enjoying the outdoors and sunshine of Hawaii all day.

Add to this that the place is located next to some type of warehouse that fires up at 4:00 am - let's just say that the sound of backup alarms is a bit hard on sleep quality.

Also, It wouldn't have been bad if it was just myself (I would have stayed the entire time if that was the case). The two of us together needed much more room to spread out than the rooms could accommodate for. The bathroom was tiny and I didn't feel like I had much privacy. The bed wasn't very comfortable and the tiny little air conditioning unit in the wall did not do a good job at cooling the room. The continental breakfast left much to be desired and we just ended up grabbing breakfast at McDonald's. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly. They didn't give us any problems when we decided to leave the next day. The location was great and the restaurant near the lobby was phenomenal. I think this is a great location for someone who is traveling solo or for a group of friends who are trying to save some money.

I am not a picky traveller and do not need to stay in fancy places but I found this hotel just horrible. First of all, the pictures DO NOT look like they are on the website - they have been doctored or a very talented professional photographer took them. In my opinion, this is false advertising. Our room resembled a prison cell. It was on the second floor, very, very small, very, very dark and very, very noisy. There were no real windows - they were frosted panes of glass. The room contained one sad looking orange chair and no table, a double bed and a pull out sofa. No fridge, no coffee maker, no safes (safes are downstairs). The bathroom is so small you couldn't even move around in it. I found the room also lacked cleanliness. There was a cheap curtain covering the closet. I went downstairs and asked for a different room and they said at first they had one and then magically they didn't. I then asked if I were to check out early if I would be charged for the last night there and they said no. So I rebooked my flights to leave a day early because I couldn't imagine staying the four nights we were orginally booked. One of the reasons I had booked this room is because it said that there was a Playstation in every room (my son is a gamer). When we get there, no playstations. I had asked where they were and they said they were in the process of 'switching companies', whatever that means. They might want to post that information on their website in order to bring it to one's attention. I was surprised when I found out there was a $10 convenience fee which they said was on their website. I looked through the whole website and did not find any mention of paying an extra $10 a day - very deceptive business practices. The parking was posted as $20 and imagine my surprise when it was actually $25 AND oh, they didn't have parking onsite and that I would have to park half a block away in a public parking area. Really??? If you don't have ample parking onsite then maybe you can offer a discount! The continental 'buffet' was lacking and there was only milk for coffee and not cream. My mom and I had come in from the beach and twice there was no water in water jug in the lobby. The elevator was TERRIBLE (slow, closed on you after two seconds of opening) and I ended up just taking the stairs. When we first arrived there a bunch of drunk people, mostly locals, tumbled out of the the restaurant and were hanging out on the stairs to the lobby and smoking. One guy was so drunk he couldn't walk. If I were the front staff I would try to shoo these people away while new people are checking in. There is also no fitness centre and no pool. What hotel in Hawaii does not have a pool?? The only, and I mean the ONLY good thing about this hotel is that it is half a block from the beach.

The cons: the wi-fi system is not working/ non-existant, the hotel faces the street where all the tour buses park (lots of street noise), they have no in-room safes (you have to use the safe in the lobby) and the main elevator is possessed.

Having now stayed there we are reminded ""if it sounds too good to be true it probably is"" The room was extremely small, maybe 120 square feet as shown on the website but had a small dresser, no table or chair, so the suitcases went on the dresser and we sat on the bed, which was a mattress on particle board and sagged badly to the center. The room floor was sticky from something and generally dirty. There was a light right outside the bathroom window and with no curtains on bath and half of bedroom it was like daylight or worse all night. In addition the windows were both very high and frosted so there was no view, city or otherwise. The breakfast was fair, watery juice and only milk for the coffee, but some decent pastries.

The room itself was small with a queen size bed, adequate but cozy. Our room had no overhead lights whatsoever. I thought this was a little odd. Instead we had only a floor lamp and a small desk lamp on the dresser as our main source of light during the evening. A bit of an inconvenience as light (overhead) in the hotel room should really be a standard at any hotel establishment. Aside from this, I had requested for a mini refrigerator and was told that they would bring it up the next day. Fair enough, it was in the evening when I requested it although it would seem a rather simple request. Maybe the houseman on duty was on break? Maybe there was limited staff? Who knows. Well the refrigerator doesn't come at all. After speaking with the front desk all they could do was apologize.I should also mention the remote for the TV in our room was broken. It was incredibly difficult to operate just switching the channels. The buttons weren't registering when trying to change channels. As we were checking out it was explained that my deposit will be released within 3-5 business days. Typical practice of any hotel however this was not the case here.I called after the 10th business day, spoke with the hotel staff in regards my deposit and was recited the hotels deposit policy again. I was assured that my deposit would be released within the next few days. It was clear that nobody knew of my situation or really cared for that matter. So I called and attempted to speak with the MOD (Manager on Duty) and was told that he was not available. Sadly, as expected this was the case every time I would call. After leaving several messages I still haven't been refunded my deposit. You would expect at the very least a return phone call. Shameful. This has been an awful experience so far. The main reason I am writing this review is because I believe future guests should be aware of such practices (and possibly what to expect) before booking a reservation at this hotel.","San Francisco, California","Lee M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",0,1.0

The lock on the door seemed flimsy and even though we were on the 4 floor I felt very exposed. The room is tiny and although the decor is as pictured, it's like putting lipstick on a pig - the mattress is thin and uncomfortable, the walls are thin and the bathroom is small and dirty. I don't think it's because they haven't cleaned it, it's just dirty the way old apartment bathrooms get dirty.

And when we got there we really wished we had! As most of the reviews say, the pictures that they have on their website and on other websites, have nothing to do with reality. We booked it based on these beautiful - deceiving - photos of a bright, spacious, modern, clean room and what we got was a tiny, dirty, dark hole. Not where you expect to stay in Hawaii, a dream-of-a-lifetime place. At first sight seems renovated, with modern furniture, but in reality is abandoned and sleazy. It's dirty and not at all great value for money. When we saw the room, we ran down immediately and asked if they could move us to another room. We were told that we had to wait for the next day, because at that time they were fully booked. With no other choice we had to sleep in that room for the night.... The soundproofing? Non existent! Zero! Worst sleep ever. Anyway, the following morning, went down for breakfast. The breakfast buffet was a joke!!! It was a small corner, with some weird looking muffins and a couple of other things. OMG! It was the most pathetic breakfast EVER! Better remove it folks, take it out of your hotel's services! After that went straight to the front desk and requested another room. The lady said we had to wait till 12.00 to see the only other room available, which was sliiiiiiightly bigger but overall similar to ours. We then asked if we could get a refund in case we'd like to move out and she said yes. That was it. We found a decent hotel a block away with less money! Terryfing experience, honestly.

The water sprayed over the shower curtain and flooded the bathroom floor. I must say the staff is very nice and they were able to get maintenance to fix the leak and unclog the toilet that night. The room does not have the typical sealed windows so it gets very noisy at night. You will hear buses and garbage trucks, as well as any construction that is going on in the area. I suggest you bring ear plugs if you are staying here. Housekeeping did not clean our room very well on a daily basis. They basically just tidied up the room like make your bed and change the towels. You can tell they do not vacuum, scrub the bathroom, or wipe any tabletops down because I see the same stains and hair on the floor. I also saw a huge roach one day right outside of our room. Some of their sheets/towels/blankets are stained. Breakfast does not consist of any hot food, there is tea/coffee, cereal, toast, or some pastries. There is also no fridge, microwave, or water boiler included in your room, but they do have a hair dryer. They say that they have beach gear available, but their beach gear is 3 beach mats, 2 floaties, and 1 beach chair. They do not have any towels available until 2pm, so I suggest you grab whatever beach gear you need the night before. They also charge you a $10 per day fee for wifi, but their wifi is sooooo slow. There were times when I could not go onto anything on my iPhone.

This hotel is very basic, but has been painted, redecorated and given new, more modern furniture. It is, however, an older building with a very, very slow elevator and old-fashioned jalousie windows which are not sound-proof. The bed linens looked clean enough, but the floor looked dirty around the edges, there is still mold or mildew in the grout/caulking of the tub, and no counter-space or cabinet-space in the bathroom, no doors on the closet (just cheap-looking curtains), and the dresser top was dented up.

When I came back to reception asking when the room I had booked was going to be ready they gave me another one, this time of normal size.- Where those windows? Why on earth would anyone use slatted glass windows? It’s the least energy efficient and soundproof thing ever, which leads to the following point.- Incredibly noisy. Proper windows would have helped a lot.- The room key stopped working twice and I had to go back to reception to have it reset.- I already knew about the resort fee ($10 +tax per night, per guest), but still I find it annoying that you have to pay for it once you check out. If they are going to charge that fee anyway, why not do it at the time of the reservation and be done with it.- When checking out I was asked whether I had a scooter, which I had not. Apparently, someone had used my room number to park their scooter. Parking is $20+tax a day, not precisely cheap. The manager quickly took that out of my bill, but it didn’t feel very reassuring, so I’ll be checking my bank account just in case.","London, United Kingdom","PracticallyImperfec</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",12,2.0

On Hotwire, I purchased the trip based on the 3 star rating. Had I known it was going to be what we experienced, I would've never made the transaction. The pictures on their site do not represent the actual room. This is more like a 1.5 or 2 stars hotel.The location is the only thing that's good with this hotel. It is situated in the same area as the high-end hotels such as Surfrider, Sheraton, Aston, etc. Very close to Waikiki beach.Now onto the real review. As soon as we walked into the room, we were hit by how tiny it is. It really does feel like a prison cell. We were given a room with a bunk bed, which we were not happy with, and couldn't even make use of the top bunk since the stairs to the top bunk were wobbly and my husband felt like the bed was going to collapse with his weight (he is not a heavy man!). So we both squeezed into the tiny bottom bunk. Thank goodness we're both slim. Needless to say, for two nights we did not sleep well.The rug on the floor was tacky and dirty. I was really hesitant to put anything on the floor (including our luggage).The bathroom was TINY. If you're a big person, you may have to keep the door open to do your business or to use the vanity mirror/sink.When we first checked in, it was late afternoon so all their housekeeping staff had left. I asked whether there is a hairdryer in the unit and was told there should be one. However, there wasn't one in our room, so I went downstairs and asked if they can provide one. The guy at the front desk told me he'd have one ready for me when I returned. Of course, at night, when I got back to the hotel, he was not there, and did not leave a note for the girl at the front desk on where the hairdryer is for the customer. So... I had to suffer a night without washing my hair. This just added another level of frustration to the day. Thank goodness, the next day I was finally able to obtain a hairdryer.There's an amenity fee of $10 that includes wifi, breakfast, the use of beach towels and some beach stuff.the amenity fee does not include parking. There is no parking at the hotel. If you have a car, you have to park at the Waikiki Banyan lot that's a 7-minute walk away for $12 a day. We couldn't wait to leave as soon as the 2 days were up and move to Moana Surfrider. The resort fee there is $30, but includes parking right across the street with in and out privileges, use of their big pool, internet, and a photo per day by a professional photographer. Thank goodness we only stayed here for 2 days and were able to enjoy the rest of our vacation at a nicer place.I guess I'm more pissed at Hotwire for marking this place up to 3 stars when it really is not.",Toronto,"absolute_di</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto</strong>",3,1.0

It was all carbs but tasty enough for a quick bite to tide one over. The bathroom was the only issue to speak of. It is REALLY tiny. It's hard to wash your face because the sink is so small and there is a shelf right above it hitting you in the face if you bend over and there was barely enough room for one person in front of the mirror, much less two. There was another mirror in the hallway though. It's kind of claustrophobic trying to get dressed in there after taking a shower but otherwise the hotel is great and the location can't be beat, especially for the price.

Then, after finally getting up to the room, this is when I really became upset. One other reviewer described the rooms in this hotel as a ""prison cell with Ikea furniture"". I couldn't explain it better myself. The room was clean, I'll give them that, but there was a horrible fluorescent light shining through the window. We woke up in the middle of the night thinking it was daylight already, and it was only 3am! I had to take one of the blankets and attach it to the air conditioning unit. I am not typically not a picky person, but this hotel is horrible. My husband had to convince me to stay, as I wanted to find another hotel. I lived in Hawaii for 6 years and as a tourist, you will not appreciate Hawaii for what it is if you stay in this hotel.","Royal Oak, Michigan","Christin7000</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Royal Oak, Michigan</strong>",6,1.0

It's fine - no complaints about the room or the cleanliness - but let down by a couple of things. Firstly there's a compulsory $10 'amenity fee', which you are ambushed with on checking in. It's dishonest to add costs, even if it's a small amount, because guests may have chosen the hotel largely because of the price.There was heavy building work going on on the site which we weren't warned about, and the noise made it impossible to spend any time there during the day.Lastly the front of house staff were completely inept and unhelpful. We asked them to book us a taxi for 3am. We asked how much it would cost and the answer was ""I don't know, sorry."" Later we enquired whether the taxi had been booked yet and they confirmed it had. At 3am we came down and the night staff said the taxi hadn't been booked.

And you have to pay an amenity fee for extra things that don't work/can't use... the internet DOES NOT work it is ridiculous, I booked this hotel thinking I was getting this included yet I have spent over $45 on roaming fee's as this is just easier than trying to connect to the wifi! Also breakfast is just bread/pastry stuff basically only good if you wanna be obese by the end of your stay. Only thing I wanted in the morning was a cup of coffee but they don't provide milk (seriously, half the world drink coffee with milk you should think about providing this!) Starbucks down the road came in useful. The other benefit your compulsory 'amenity fee' covers is free dvd hire - well this did not work either, we tried 3 different dvds which wouldn't play so don't know if the problem was the dvd player or the dvd's... so gave up. The TV in the room is at the edge of the room and cannot be moved/twisted. We had a twin room so bed one could see the tv by leaning to one side but bed 2 may as well forget it. Bad design. The 'amenity fee' also covered free beach stuff to hire... good things always picked up early only broken deck chairs and falling to pieces beach mats left by the time we got there.Although frustrating - the location, friendly staff and reasonable price made up for all the bad points, with a few improvements this hotel would really be on to a good thing.

Floors were ceramic tile with a small throw rug, neither of which showed evidence of recent cleaning, (The maid's cart had a vacuum cleaner but it is doubtful it had been used for awhile.) Certainly a mop had not met the tile floor for quite some time. The bathroom fixtures were old, some faucets turned backwards, previously chrome items such as sink drain. paper holder etc. are now rusted. One day the maid removed the dirty towels but didn't replace them with fresh ones.The bed caved in toward the middle so 2 people have no choice but to roll against each other. The air conditioner did work but was located within a foot of the head of the bed so the person sleeping on that side had cold air blowing directly on his head & neck. The advertised parking garage has less spaces than there are rooms so look forward to using a public facility and walking 2 blocks to and from your car.

The bathroom has a nice round mirror with a small shelf but again there is enough wall space to add shelves. Bed comfort was basically ok - I did not experience discomfort. Definitely a noisy location due to trash and delivery trucks early in the morning. We were lucky to get an assigned parking space because they are limited. The garage is convenient and secure with a remote to go in and out. Spaces are extremely tight and although you are assigned a stall, people park wherever so you could get stuck with a space you have to work a 10 point parking routine. Can't complain about the free continental breakfast. Didn't like the coffee but some of the pastries were ok. We walked next door to Burger King for coffee. The staff was nice.

The curtains were insufficient to block out light at night and the light right outside the window didn't help. The beach was a very short walk away. I could find very few places to hang wet towels and swimming costumes from in the room. I thought a row of hooks on the concrete block wall would have been great given the location. The room had a TV and playstation, which we didn't use. The bathroom could have done with a good scrub down of all surfaces, and a re-paint, but was clean enough. For the price and location it was a good place to stay. Being in Waikiki you're unlikely to spend a lot of time in your room!So yes I would recommend Stay Waikiki.

In saying that, we found this hotel conveniently located in Waikiki. To be honest, the photos were more appealing in comparison to the real room BUT I also have to say that regardless of the noise and very simplistic setup of our room, my boyfriend and I had a really wonderful stay here as mentioned in the title. The staff were super friendly, welcoming and warm, the room provided everything we needed and transportation was just around the corner. I also took advantage of the daily breakfast and I was happy with it. As mentioned by other guests, we were also lucky enough not to experience the sight of cockroaches roaming around. For a budget accommodation, it is definitely one to consider. HOWEVER, my boyfriend and I, although we appreciate the fancier hotels, we are not fussy about staying at less modern places such as this. It all depends on the type of traveller you are and I suggest that if you are looking for a more luxurious experience, that you stay elsewhere. Overall, it was great staying here and we thank you the staff at Stay for being so accommodating!PROS: Affordable, friendly and helpful staff, convenient location.CONS: Not as modern, breakfast was all pastry, amenity fees at check out.","Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","Mary Grace M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Victoria, Australia</strong>",3,5.0

It is for travelers on budget, with 2 minutes from Waikiki beach, food store, restaurants, car rentals, but not the most comfortable. It was more noisier that we expected. We have earplugs always when traveling, but an orientation of this room towards the most busiest street, and back of Hayat AC and receiving made it harder to sleep. My only complaint was cockroaches..yes they have them. We killed 2 first night, and decided no food of any shape or form in the room, and that did the trick.We talked to a locals and the story is that they do have roaches problem on the island. All windows have these horizontal strips of glass, and since it was windy we opened those ""strips"" and had nice breeze, no need for AC which we do not like to use. We paid extra fee $10 per day to the hotel, for breakfast, internet...but really never used any, and didn't eat their breakfast. Hotel is next door to the International Hostel, that is the same way designed, so you can get the idea of the room sizes. I would say it is not kids friendly, since it is not as clean, especially the floors. So, if you are on the budget, and can ignore some of the inconveniences, this is a good place to stay. If you like the comfort of a big chain hotels, this is not a place for you.

I guess the best way to handle this is by lows and highs. First lets talk about the hotel. The building its self is the typical low rise unit of the late50's early 60's build that flooded Waikiki at that time. Location is good as it is directly behind the Hyatt towers and central to the Waikiki strip. It looks like it has had had several updates, namely the lobby and the rooms. The elevator and car park leave lots to be dsired. If you expect to park at the hotel be preared to be told there is no stalls availible. When you do get one it will cost you 20/night. This is a little high for Waikiki but not overly bad either. Parking is tight so if your not a fabulous driver be ware. We paid 84/night for the room but remeber they have a ""resort charge"" that you also have to pay which is 10.00 per day. This resort charge is a farse. It includes there continental breakfast, coffee in the lobby tell 2pm, beach goodies, movie rentals and internet service. Forget you are getting a breakfast as it is not worth it, they goodies for the beach are left overs rom previous patrons that left there goodies behind. The wifi works sometimes but is netorious for booting you out. The movies rentals does work but subject to availibility. Room wise its a Ikea special not bad and I must say the materess was very comfortable. The tub in the bathroom had big black streaks in it and looked discusting but they didn't come off. Staff is fair unless you have a complaint then they get off standish. So just accept it for what it is and remember its going to not be as cheep as advertised. For us it worked this way 84/night for room 20/night for parking and 10/night for resort fee. It adds up. Would I stay again no, there is better for the 120/night that it worked out to with tax.","Vancouver, Canada","loveit45</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",23,2.0

It was through a Groupon deal where we paid $145 for the two nights. Keep in mind though that the hotel has other fees such as local taxes, parking, and the notorious “convenience” fee. The $10 a day convenience fee supposedly covers things like wifi, breakfast, and DVD rentals. Parking was $20 per night and you get a remote which opens the gate to the garage. I guess this guarantees you a parking spot. I would recommend parking down the street at the King’s Village lot which costs about $10 per day. It’s just a couple buildings away from the hotel and is a very short walk. As for the rooms, they were small, but they were clean and modernly styled (think along the lines of an Ikea). I didn’t have a problem how small the rooms were, especially considering the price we paid and the distance we were to the beach. Let’s face it, if you spend all your time in a hotel room while you’re in Waikiki, you are there for the wrong reason. In the mornings they have a continental breakfast laid out with your typical pastries and coffee. If you are going to the beach, you can borrow lounge chairs, mats, or boogie boards from reception, but they are on a first come first serve basis. There’s also a kiosk where you can borrow DVD’s to watch in your room. The people at the front desk are very friendly and glad to give you directions along with suggestions. The greatest perk for staying here is the price and location. You are conveniently located near the beach, International Market, King’s Village Farmer’s Market, along with shopping and restaurants. Everything is within a short walking distance.

Road noise was a bit of an issue but was mostly solved by turning the A/C full blast. I was disappointed to see an extra $10 fee for my room to cover 'complimentary amenities'. It included DVD rentals, continental breakfast and wifi. We literally just needed a place to sleep so we only used the wifi, which in the end was not complimentary, it was $10.

It was one of those grow on me experiences. When we arrived, we were surprised with a $10 fee per day, but I soon found out that it was well worth it. Once we bought a simple meal at a dive resteraunt nearby and paid $30.00, we appreciated the continental breakfast. They had many choices of pastries and were quick to replentish. The lobby area was relaxing to eat in. We also liked the ability to connect to WiFi while we were there. The most surprising thing though (and the thing that really made $10 a day worth it) was the courtesy of the staff and the ability to just grab whatever beach item we wanted from a box in the lobby. We could get snorkle gear, boogie boards, beach towels, beach chairs and bamboo mats. Just grab and go one block to the beach when your done just return them to the box.I will return and will tell everyone I know who is looking for value in Waikiki about the STAY HOTEL!Ohh - one other thing.

On the receipt, Orbitz gave us a receipt for this hotel below… Having almost the same identical address, as the Hyatt back entrance. We did not realize the word Stay was the name of a hotel.We just thought it was a fluke and that maybe the Hyatt had more than entrance and more than one address. This picture they have posted onlineTotally Misrepresented: (see our actual room pictures below)1. The pictures posted on the net were not taken from anything we saw. Actual room was tiny, dark, dirty, unsafe, and probably infested. Room # 404 that we were given was not anything like the pictures on line.2. Hotel staff told us they did not feel comfortable putting us in the room above that we saw online and instead gave us a double bed that they said was a better bigger room.3. Hotel staff would not let us enter or see our room or any room until after 4:00 pm. We asked if they could hold our luggage until the room was ready so we did not have to cart it around the island. Waiting for the room to become available, we decided to go sightseeing, the local beach, stores and the area around Waikiki, just to kill time.4. Hotel staff allowed us to leave our luggage in a cluttered dirty back room on the 1st floor. They did not give us a receipt for our storage luggage and did not have a separate secure place for it.5. Giving the hotel staff an extra hour, we waited until 5 pm to return to the hotel. However, after seeing our room, we were appalled; we immediately went to the desk and tried to cancel our reservation. The hotel staff would not let us cancel our room reservation, stating the reservation was thru Orbitz and we had to cancel thru Orbitz! Hotel staff stated there was a 24-hour minimum cancellation in effect. If we were to leave, they would charge us for a full night whether we stayed or not! We had no other place to go.6. The elevator doors were very mean to everyone and kept closing on guests. Even after the door hit you, it kept hitting you! 7. Upon entering, the back room on the 1st floor to get our luggage there was a huge cockroach lying dead next to our suitcases. We informed the hotel staff that the cockroach was there, hotel staff pretended not to hear our comment about the bugs lying dead on the floor! 8. Our room door to the outside had no threshold under the door and the door had a gap of an inch or more from the door to the concrete floor and anything could crawl in or out during the night.9. The hot water faucet in the tub worked backwards and was dangerous – turns counterclockwise to turn down or off, cold is opposite clockwise for off (the way it should be).10. The bed was a single mattress lying on thin sheets of sagging chipboard. The mattress was held in place on 3 sides with additional molding attached to the chipboard, the front of the mattress was held in place with drywall screws that were sticking out of the chipboard approximately 1 inch.11. The light switch when we finally found it was on the floor, in a cord behind the dresser cabinet.12. Windows are the older tiny louvered, drafty, type. We were unable to see out. Even if the windows had been clean, they were too high up in the room, and over the bed, so no windows to look out of at all, and very little light in, sort of like a dungeon. 13. The carpet - more like an area throw rug was filthy.14. Behind the bed and the TV dresser was filthy and dirty, (had not, been vacuumed in quite some time).15. The elevator doors were very mean to everyone and kept closing on guests. Even after the door hit you, it kept hitting you! Trying to get out was a repeat fight with the elevator doors.16. The dog next to the room kept barking constantly we are talking approximately 10 feet away just on the other side of the concrete balcony and walkway.17. The room was so bad we did not feel comfortable or safe disrobing, opening any of our luggage for fear bugs would get into our luggage or even our bed. We left all the lights on when attempting to sleep to keep the critters away. Sleeping on the beach probably would have been cleaner, quieter and or healthier.18. My wife put the supposedly clean towels on the floor from the bathroom to the bed for us to walk on so our clean feet would not get dirty going to the bathroom.19. The towels/rags had black hair stuck in them from the last guests who had long, black, course hair.20. The throw pillow that was on the bed also had stains on it from some previous guest.21. The outside sheet was not clean.22. Behind the bed and dresser was more hair, dust and dirt that was obviously from the staff or previous customers that had worked or played in room 404.23. Trying to get out was a repeat fight with the elevator doors, repeatedly hitting our luggage and us.24. We did not get our Complimentary Breakfast – after seeing the big cockroach, and the other filth, we did not deem it safe to eat the food. Nor was the breakfast ready when we hurriedly exited the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. 25. Hotel staff would not give us a check out receipt, stating that we had to get if from Orbitz, so we still do not know what we were charged, for that night in hell.The night hotel staff stated, they would only charge us for one night – although we could not get them to give us any documentation to that effect. Refund or not we could not subject ourselves to another night in that hotel with these conditions.We went down the street to the “Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel” (right on the beach) where we received superior service. We got an excellent, large, clean, quiet room, two queen beds, continental breakfast, beach picnic with free complimentary picnic cooler, proper plumbing, free entertainment, pool, iron, ironing board, hair dryer, numerous complimentary soaps and lotions, free beach chairs to take to the beach from the hotel which was just out the front door, all with no night critters. We had excellent beach view, much better location actually on the beach street. The best investment and the best $24 we have ever spent.

I returned and wanted to use the restroom before I went to the airport. Front desk directed me to the restroom. Restroom, was occupied. After waiting a few minutes I knocked on bathroom door again and a woman(not a hotel guest), opened the door and explained she had been changing her clothes . That bathroom is accessable through the garage of the hotel, which is not secured. I read the reviews on Trip Advisor and cannot believe the positive reviews and question if those review writers even stayed at this hotel. Also on the last day, front desk, gave me a ""courtesy call"" 15 minutes before checkout about checkout time. 10 minutes before checkout time housekeeping knocked on my door and to see if I had left, so they start cleaning my room. Find another hotel in Waikiki. The $10 ""resort fee"" was a rip off.","New York City, New York","Carol B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",80,2.0

Always friendly and helpfull, oh yeah and the free wirless internet was good too.The rest not so.Rooms:It's a good thing we left our cat at home because there was no way would have been able to swing it. Once the bed was in there was less than 20cm each side before you hit the wall, so we had to climb in from the foot of the bed.The A/C was good and it was needed as the building is an old 1950's/60's Besser Block structure that really holds the heat. The unit was located at floor level at the head end on one side of the bed. Fine for cooling when you weren't sleeping, but one person ends up with a very cold head at night! The bed however was quite comfy, and the room was clean.The bathroom was small but functional, the only issues were the towel rail hanging over the toilet (you would't want to hang it in a hurry and miss), and Kramer and Jerry would be as satisfied with the low-flow shower as we were.Ammenties:When we checked in we found out we were being charged an extra $10 per day ammenity fee. The only ammenity that I could find was the free wireless internet, but having said that if you had to pay for wireless $10 a day is a pretty goog deal.Breakfast:Nothing to get excited about.

The staff (shout out to Liane!) are pleasant and make every effort to ensure you're comfortable, but are never right in your face. The hotel itself, though an older property, is really cute (mostly white, modernist decor) and clean, next to the best surf shop in town (Koa Board Sports) and only a block from the main surf break at Canoes (just around the corner from the Hyatt)!My only gripe is the room (I had the cheapest room, with a bunk bed) was maybe a bit TOO spartan. Very very clean, but could have been improved with a chair and maybe a bigger side table. Also, there was no real place to put your suitcase to unpack so i had to do it from the floor. HOWEVER, at just about $101/night (including all taxes) I can, and did, live with it. Other than the savings, the location of the hotel really can't be beat - true, you're not right on the beach, but it's just a block away, shopping and great food (Me's BBQ, Hula Dog, Furusato Sushi Bar and the Loco Moco at Hula Grill were standouts for me), convenience stores, bus stop, etc. all within close walking distance. Me's BBQ became my absolute favorite place to eat in Waikiki (see my separate review forthcoming) - located right next to the ""other pink hotel"", the Royal Grove (another great budget option - was actually going to stay there but it was booked). Me's is a casual eatery with amazing island-style korean food and tasty, cheapo breakfasts. Their bibimbap and mac salad were the best I've ever had.The hotel served a continental breakfast (including these yummy sausage rolls) with coffee and Tang (yes, that's right TANG - I grew up on that, so I didn't mind;)).Definitely book at Stay if you're planning a more active vacation (surfing/hiking, etc.) where you're not spending a lot of time in your room. why would you do that anyway?? you're in HAWAII, for crying out loud....","Los Angeles, California","HolboxBound</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",84,4.0

I'm talking a block away from everything! Waikiki Beach, the main restaurants, rental services, and since you are right behind the Hyatt all shuttles to Luaus, tours , etc pick you up basically from the Stay lobby!- The extremely helpful staff!

As the title says, it is what it is. It seemed to be an apartment block turned into a low price hotel / motel, think of it like business class for a backpacker. Dont expect luxury, its not what your paying for. The rooms are big enough (queen bed on 7th floor) although the bathroom is small but even at 6'6"" it wasnt a big deal for me. If you want ocean views from your room dont bother, just walk 100m to the beach. PROS: The location is excellent and only a street back from Waikiki Beach, not even 100m away. Theres air con, a balcony, a bed, a tv, a playstation, wifi, a shower and a toilet. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The lobby is welcoming. The self service laundromat downstairs was very handy and something the bigger hotels could benefit from. CONS: Street noise that other reviews mention was noticeable, but i felt it was drowned out by the air con. Without refitting the entire hotel with new windows the noise will always be a problem for some. The curtains could be better and are about 60-70% efficient, but on the flip side Hawaii is a beautiful place so worthwhile getting up early anyway to take a stroll. No fridge in the room for cold drinks and snacks. TV placement would be a problem for some but a room for me on holiday is a place to sleep. Room wasnt ready for check in until 4pm, but we were able to sleep in the lobby on the comfy couches anyway and guzzle a couple beers purchased from the local ABC store, not so bad. OVERALL: Great value for money. Would happily stay again, you get what you pay for. If you want 4-5 star and all the fancy hotel jazz then load your credit card up and stay elsewhere.

It is a newly renovated building, not fancy, but done nicely. Everything is new and modern, great decor. You can tell the building is old here and there, but this is what is to be expected with budget and the area.The location is absolutely perfect. Short walk to everywhere in the area and close to bus stops for getting to further areas. A little over a block to Waikiki Beach, right across from the Hyatt.The staff was amazing and always helpful! They were so personable and always willing to help! Even the cleaning staff was sure to always smile and help in any way.The lobby of the hotel is a nice area to relax between outings or in the morning. This is where breakfast is served (assortment of pastries, breads, juices). Plenty of plush, new sofas, canopy chairs and TV. They also have a business area for guest use, a collection of beach accessories (chairs, mats, floaties) and free DVD/video game rentals! All of this and wi-fi is included in the $10/day additional fee.The room was great, everything we needed. Very clean, awesome new decor and a balcony with table and chairs. There was a flat-screen TV and iPod docking station. We had bunk beds and they were very comfortable. The bathroom was quite small, and there wasn't much light in the shower. However, it was clean and served its purpose. We never had the noise issues others have described, but we were on a high floor. Keep in mind, this is a budget-oriented place. There is no restaurant (although they are in the process of adding one) and no pool. You are not going to get luxury, but you are also paying an amazing price for being right in Waikiki.

Not, not really. But for our purposes of having a place to crash after a day of hiking and exploring Oahu, this place was perfect. Similar to what some people have said, the rooms can be a bit small but we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a larger room for our two nights there. Score! I will also verify some of the other comments people have said: it is indeed next to a budget hostel which could be noisy. We were there just after Spring Break so the place was empty and not really an issue for us. The early morning garbage trucks are real and will show up 6 am or so like clockwork. The windows are glass slat types that will keep water out but not much noise. Depending on your expectations of a hotel, these things may bother you but for the two of us, they were non issues. We both slept with earplugs, making all of these things a non factor during our stay. One other thing of note is that the bathroom was on the interior of the building so all the steam from your shower would have to escape out into the room once you opened the door. I am always puzzled by places that don't have a fan or put the bathroom with small window to the outside to let fresh air in. All of that stuff said, it was an absolute steal for what we paid (we did a bundle with a car from a main travel site that was wayyy cheaper than booking both separately). We did have a car rental as well, which we parked about 3 blocks away at Hotel Banyan for $10 per 24 hrs with in/out privileges. There was a sign up that this was increasing to $12 effective June 1st 2012. The 3 block walk didn't bother us but if you have limited mobility or kids, walking back to hotel may bother you. Breakfast is white bread, unfrozen muffins/pastries, jam, juice and coffee. You don't want to fill up on the stuff but it will let you eat something before you begin your day, which is convenient. Service was great, with each staff member being super nice. There is an ABC store about 3 doors down for late night drinks and munchies, a Mexican restaurant that has happy hour about 5 doors down and the beach is about a 2 minute walk from the place. Can't really complain about the location as it was pretty much perfect. I can see how if you're here at the wrong time of year, this place would be brutal.

It is hard to get a good bargain on certain things, especially in Waikiki, where everything caters to tourists. However, Stay Waikiki is a great little gem that disproves the idea that a deal can't be had. My husband and I had been staying at the Hilton (paid for in part by his work, in part by our Hilton rewards), but when we ran out of free nights, we needed somewhere cheap to stay for the last few nights. Really, we weren't looking for a regular ""hotel"" - we just needed a place to lay our heads at night (who spends a lot of time in their hotel rooms anyway when you are in the most beautiful place in the world?!). Stay Waikiki fit all of our criteria: helpful staff, modest yet clean rooms, great location, and a fantastic rate. No suites were available when we booked, but we got a double room for $89/night, plus a $10/night resort fee, which includes free newspapers, free breakfast (pastries and coffee and juice), free wi-fi internet and use of printer, and free DVD rentals. Also, the hotel has plenty of beach toys you can borrow, ranging from straw beach mats to boogie boards. People of all ages - traveling singles, young families, and older couples - stayed here during our 2 nights, so this breaks the mold of being a ""budget"" or even ""dorm"" lodging. The room: bed was comfortable for two, we had a mini-fridge, plenty of storage room, a breakfast table and sofa bed, and a small (clean, but badly in need of an upgrade) bathroom. The wi-fi works great in the room. We only got 2 towels total, but there is maid service daily which will replenish your supplies. Downsides: we could hear entire conversations coming in from the vent in our room from some other room (I think from right above us, it was difficult to tell) and there was a huge gap in between our door and the floor (as in, 2-3 inches space). No bugs or anything got in, but still, a bit off-putting.

We choose this hotel because it looked like a cool, trendy, contemporary place! Plus it describes itself as a ""boutique hotel"". But it seems that every hotel which has contemporary & trendy furniture (Ikea) and less than 50 bedrooms can call itself a ""boutique hotel"". However if you find a dirty and filthy carpet in your bedroom, a not up to standard cleaned bathroom, floor and furniture’s you WILL question the description named above. The room and the hotel itself felt more like a hostel, rather than a hotel! The staff at the front desk were friendly, however not very well trained or confident. Also it felt that they did not want to go the extra mile to make their guests feel 100% comfortable. This is why after listening to a conversation the receptionist had with another guest while waiting to be served we decided not to bother with ""feedback"" about the room and our ""discomfort"" as we thought that there wasn't much they can or want to do about it anyway. I guess because this hotel does not have a lot of returning leisure guests as most of them are tourists visiting from all over the world, and ""Stay Hotel Waikiki"" doesn't strike me as the place to hold functions, conferences or to be attractive for business people, the interest in keeping every customer happy didn't seemed to be top priority. We paid $10.00 per night amenities fee, which includes breakfast, wireless internet, use of the guest computer, comp. newspapers available in the lobby and coffee served (help yourself service) throughout the day. Ok, it is what it is and even if we didn't want to make use of any of this we still had to pay it. The breakfast was ""served"" on plastic plates and cutlery in the lobby on two tables next to the elevator and included toast, jam, butter, Danish & tea/coffee, with seats available (or not) in the lobby.We couldn't find the restaurant/bar. However two blocked of doors where we were able to store our luggage and looked like a building site is probably where it will be eventually once it's finished. The good thing about this hotel is its location, just one block away from Waikiki Beach and close to bus routes going into every direction. The bad thing is the noise...but we were well aware that if you book a city center hotel, you will not get a lot of sleep, so NOT really the hotels fault.

We also asked for a refrigerator, and they stated they had none available. On the third day of asking, they finally upgraded us to a bigger room with a balcony and a refrigerator on the 5th floor and BOY WAS IT A DIFFERENCE! The new room was much larger and had an amazing view from the balcony! The room on the fifth floor would be rated as a 3 star hotel. We loved it! As far as the breakfast goes, don't expect anything of it. The breakfast is nothing more than just coffee, tea, some small pastries, and slices of bread with a toaster. Nothing more, and usually they run out of pastries unless you're the first one there. The elevator they have is the oldest elevator that I've ever been in in my entire life. The doors close on their own and slam you from the sides. It also almost broke our stroller and gave us some bruises. They also charge an additional $10 per night surprise fee on top of your hotel price (for the breakfast and wifi internet). Note to hotel manager: - Replace the elevator.- Make the breakfast a little better. (add some potato wedges and french toast at least)- Make customers aware of the horrible rooms on the lower floors and have a choice when booking (with different pricing). - Remove the surprise $10 a night fee by including with the original booking rate. - Replace windows that actually seal","Beaverton, OR","Sergey K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beaverton, OR</strong>",0,4.0

Since I didn't have the wife and kid and would be busy all day, I opted for the cheapest hotel I could find in Waikiki that had decent reviews on TripAdvisor. Stay Waikiki had an Expedia deal for a $90 a night room with bunk beds, so I went with them. A couple issues I had:1) parking - there is VERY limited parking available at the hotel, and the staff said that there was $8/night parking available at the adjacent building. The actual price for parking had changed to $20/night unbeknownst to the staff, so I had to correct them.2) room - I've stayed in some cramped rooms before, but this was one of the smallest I had ever seen. The bunk bed was also very cheap, like used dorm furniture.3) fees - there is some kind of $10/night fee for. . . I don't know what. I noticed a warning for it after I booked the Expedia deal, so I think Stay should just put it in the base price of the room4) loud - the walls aren't well insulated and this is one of the noisiest parts of Waikiki due to buses and service trucks pulling in behind the Waikiki Hyatt Regency, so it was pretty noisy all nightOtherwise the hotel was fine and served its purpose of giving me a place to crash. The room was very clean its VERY close to EVERYTHING in Waikiki, so you won't be at a loss for places to eat or things to do. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling with friends on a budget and relying on public transportation.

My hubs and I figured what did the hotel we stay at matter since we didn't plan on being in the hotel anyways. We actually ended up staying in more than we thought! The windows are these frosted glass panes that you can control to open or close. It gave the room a feel like we were in Thailand or Indonesia or something.

The pros outweigh the few cons about this property and I will likely return again.Pros:Value - My partner and I like to travel on a budget but we don't want to stay in a dump! After a prior poor experience staying at an older resort-style hotel during our last trip to Honolulu, we were looking for a more positive experience and better value for our money this time around. This place fit the bill - affordable, fresh, clean, and comfortable. Concept - I am a little tired of resorts in Honolulu. They're nice if well executed but often fall short. What I love about Stay Waikiki is that it doesn't try to be a full-featured resort, and this is definitely refreshing. The location is great - just a block to the beach! Brand-new, ice-cold A/C units.New, comfortable furniture - It's obviously from Ikea but I love that.Friendly, accomodating staff.$10/day ""resort"" fee - Many reviewers have mentioned this as a negative aspect of their stay here but I found it to be a good value. The fee covers a lot: it includes a newspaper each day, unlimited use of the hotel's wifi connection and business center, AND as many rental movies as you want (though you may find that newly-released films may already be checked out!). I would suggest, however, that the fee be included in the cost of the room and not as an additional charge tacked on at check-in.There are a few cons that I have to mention:Lack of mini-fridge units - In order to get a mini-fridge in your room, you must request one, and there are a limited number of units. I requested a fridge for several days and did not receive one. The hotel should invest in installing mini-fridges in each room.Noise - This hotel's walls and windows are thin. If you are assigned a room on a lower floor and/or facing Koa Avenue, you will hear nighttime revelers, tour buses, early morning garbage trucks, and more. If you are a light sleeper, try to request a room on a higher floor towards the back of the hotel and plan to bring earphones.This problem could be mitigated somewhat if the hotel installed modern, double-pane windows in the rooms. Continental Breakfast - The continental breakfast includes just a few types of pastry, wheat toast, fruit punch, and coffee (with powdered creamer). I would have loved to see fresh fruit, a variety of types of juice (rather than just fruit punch), and half and half for the coffee included, especially since we couldn't get a fridge to keep these things in our room ourselves. My partner and I come to Honolulu once per year and I hope to stay at this property again, especially if the cons I mentioned are sorted out.","Seattle, WA","Laura W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, WA</strong>",8,4.0

But we like to take a chance on hotels that have been recently remodeled. Some other recently remodeled hotels we've stayed at: Waikiki Pearl and Queen Kapiolani.Whether we stay at a hotel like the Four Seasons or an economy hotel, we still want clean rooms. This hotel passes the ""clean room"" test. For the location and cleanliness, you get good value. Consider it like a well-runned Hampton Inn... except in Waikiki. Please note that I'm basing the experience on the upgraded room.++++Staff is very attentive and personable. Way better than staying at a 1,000 room resort, where nobody knows you.Responded to clogged tub drain issue immediately.$10 resort/ day fee is fair and gives you internet (works about 80% of the time), dvd rentals, and use of beach mats, chairs, floats; daily newspaper; (typical) continental breakfast of juice, coffee, toast, and pastries; a business area, so you can print boarding passes, use the internet.Very close to the Beach. You're smack right in the middle of the Waikiki strip. 10 minute walk to the zoo, one way and 10 minute walk to Beachwalk (Lewers) the other way. Restaurants are plentiful nearby. I prefer that small hotel buildings don't have restaurants, because I may be stuck in the room right above the restaurant (you can hear the noise and smell the kitchen.)Very convenient to the bus stops. We take the bus everywhere when we stay in Waikiki.Laundry facilities available - wash is only $1 and 45-minute dry is 75 cents.- - - - If you're a large-sized person, the bathroom may be an issue. It is tiny... like 15 SF. (You can wash your sandy feet while you're sitting on the toilet.) We're not large, so it worked out okay. And who hangs out in the bathroom?Couldn't quite figure out if hotel is being ""green"" or staff just forgot to make it to our rooms and get us new towels. We usually fix our own bed, and re-use our towels (because that's what we do at home), but it was stretching it a bit, when all towels got used up (because we went to the beach) and trash bin was overflowing. For those who complain about noise... you're in the middle of Waikiki, which is a very popular area. You can stay at the Royal Hawaiian for $350 - $400 per night if you want quiet.Recommendation to hotel:1) get wifi to work fulltime2) include the fairly priced resort fee in the nightly room rate; we like to prepay our vacations beforehand, so the resort fee was a bit of surprise.3) Fix the elevator's door sensor. The elevator door's closing too quickly will maim somebody one of these days.","Seattle, WA","Asia_Trip_Reviewer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, WA</strong>",7,4.0

My return flight was overbooked, so I called Stay and they made a room for me for 3 days.Service: Front desk staff is mostly outstanding. Warm, friendly, accommodating and helpful--they are the personification of the Aloha Spirit. Daily housekeeping is quietly efficient and respectful.Location: Premium. In the shadow of The Hyatt, in the middle of Waikiki, 1 block to the beach, and walking distance to all things local.Rooms: Clean and small. My top/8th floor unit was a quiet room with single bunk beds. Linens and beds are fresh and comfortable. I believe all units have balconies. I would not want to stay a week in a room this small, especially if I was traveling with someone, but for others it might be ok. My only suggested improvements: Coffee maker and mini fridge in room.Amenities: Not much. But there is free morning coffee in the lobby, ice, parking on a first-come fee basis, and beach gear available. Free Wi-Fi was jankey and unreliable.Summary: Clean rooms and an outstanding staff, at a reasonable price, makes this hotel a good value and a recommended place to stay.As always; I travel to Waikiki several times a year, I can advise that Waikiki is a nice tropical urban adventure. The city comes with the negatives of a big city, along with the overwhelming benefits of a beautiful beachfront resort. Generally, everything in Waikiki is “a little tired” although there have been continuous improvements in the last few years. If you are traveling solo, take Roberts Hawaii from the airport (no rsvr rqd). Two or more people, take a taxi from the airport to the hotel (should be under $40).

I was a little bit hesitant prior to booking as there were limited reviews about the hotel. Stay Waikiki is a small hotel with an awesome location (right behind the Hyatt, between the two towers on Koa Avenue). The beach and the main strip Kalakaua Ave are both 1 block away and there are ABC stores on both ends of the block (and around every corner of every block) for water, beer, snacks, snorkeling gear and Hawaii souvenirs.We had a standard queen bedroom, which included a lanai with a sliver of an oceanview. Room had AC, flatscreen TV, adequate closet space with drawers, and a very dated, small bathroom. The bathroom was probably my least favourite part of the hotel but not significant enough to ruin my stay. It was quite noisy especially early in the morning, as tour buses start loading and unloading right on Koa Avenue, in the back of the Hyatt. They also have service trucks on the other end of the hotel, which are just as loud. This is not the hotel's fault but just to keep in mind if you are a light sleeper.The hotel offers free complimentary breakfast daily, free wi-fi (connection was spotty at times) and has limited self-parking available at a first-come, first-serve basis for $15/day. We chose to park at the Waikiki Banyan (on Ohua and Kuhio) instead for $60/week with unlimited in-and-out privileges. They also have washer/dryer machines available for use at a cost. You can purchase single dose packets of laundry detergent and dryer sheets at the ABC store.Housekeeping staff were very hardworking and front desk staff could not be nicer. They were always happy to see you and offered very helpful insight about all things Oahu.Some constructive feedback for the hotel would be to better display the various extras that are available to the hotel guests, for example, washer/dryer usage, parking, fridge, iron, ice, DVD rental, printing services, etc. Almost all of our ""extra"" requests were met; we just had to ask for them as we didn't know if they were offered. It would be helpful for the guests to know that they have all of these extra services and amenities available - maybe via a pamphlet or sign.I would recommend this hotel on the condition that you don't expect more than what you are paying for; it is a clean, no frills hotel with all the basic necessities (and some extras).",Canada,"Kousnzca</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",11,3.0

I would give 2.5 points but rounded down because I was given the runaround. We were hesitant to book anything besides our ""regular"", well known hotel where we always stay. The STAY WAIKIKI had good deals, was newly renovated, had only few but good reviews, so we gave it a shot. Here's what you need to know before you book, and if you decide to go with it, what to look for when you arrive. 1) The hotel is newly renovated and has a clean feel overall with modern styling elements and contrasty colors. The rooms have wood laminate floors. The baths are tiny. The fixtures are not updated, but are acceptable. In my room when sitting on the bowl, I could rest my chin on the sink. One could see that as a plus, or minus. Showers were completely tiled, which I prefer over silicone sealed plastic tubs. I was wary about the little brown crawling insects after some of the reviews, but did not see ANY in the 9 days I was there. 2) ONLY FLOORS 5 THROUGH 8 have balconies aka Lanais. So if you check in and expect a room with a balcony, make sure it's on floor 5 or higher and explicitely ask for a DELUXE (if that's what you booked). I'd also say from floor 6 and up you get a good view. The hotel is so narrow that it's only one room wide, meaning every entrance is on one side, every window or balcony is on the other (towards Diamond Head). 3) The tricky part is to catch a DELUXE room WITH a lanai. The supply here is limited. We booked a deluxe with lanai explicitly and they gave us a standard with lanai. After pointing this out, they moved us to a deluxe without lanai on floor 4, which we declined - terrible view and no lanai. We eat take-out on our lanai and rely on it. The ""booking system did also not allow for predicting when the next deluxe WITH lanai gets available"" - really, guys? Really? Well if you can't predict how long a room is taken, then I understand that the reservation system also does not allow for you to RESERVE me a deluxe with lanai, which is what I had booked in the first place. Ok, how stupid do you think I am. It's the age of computers. And luckily, also the age of tripadvisor reviews. 4) The DELUXE rooms are MUCH bigger than the standard. The standard is a shoe box. In the Deluxe you have room to breath. I saw both rooms, and believe me. You want the DELUXE SIZE, WITH lanai.5) The parking garage is tiny and holds about 8-10 cars with only 2 spots allowing for full size cars or bigger. I'd say one or 2 spots can hold mini vans. I took the small spots with my Chevy Cobalt rental leaving the bigger ones for the minivans and had to maneuver multiple times to get in and out. NO KIDDING. Oh, btw, parking was ""full"" when we arrived and we were immediately advised that we have to park off site. $8 without in-and-out privileges. They used this as a bargaining chip later though (AHA!) and suddenly parking was available (and complimentary which was very nice, so thanks for this plus).6) The staff is friendly, absolutely. But they are advised by their management to give you the runaround when it comes to giving you what you booked. I feel for them, but if you don't get your reservation system fixed it will be a returning problem. Again, we did book the DELUXE WITH LANAI and WE DID NOT GET IT. We're still on the phone daily with Expedia to get a refund. What a hassle. Had we known that, we would have gone with our ""old"" hotel where we know what we get into (which floor, which room, parking, staff etc). Again, friendly staff at the STAY, but the underlying theme was still visible which is giving you the runaround until you give up. If I have a week off, do I want to have a hassle with the front desk FOR TWO THIRDS of my vacation only so that I can get what I booked AND PAID FOR, only two days before I leave? No. And management knows that. Listen, management. Customers have a pretty good antenna for when they are given the runaround. No, I will not recommend this hotel to my friends, because of that.7) Location is awesome. We saw whales from our lanai and you're right in the middle of things. I do prefer Hawaii in summer though. It's lush, greener, warmer, and smells better with the ginger and plumeria in bloom and the hala fruit falling. Less guava though in summer. It also seems like there are a little less tourists in summer.8) IT IS LOUD even with closed windows and sliding doors. I had to use ear plugs every night, which was expected and is normal in the middle of the city. If you have been to Waikiki, you know that. If it will be your first time, be advised that you can't escape the sounds of the streets, nighlife, reversing buses, barking. Anywhere except in a high rise building on floors 15 and up (be advised, there you might have helicopter sounds).",Michigan,"joojanta</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Michigan</strong>",18,2.0

I came to the front desk 5 times in the course of 2 days to seek out the ever elusive manager - he never showed up!

Just 400+ feet away from the beach and down the street from King's Crossing and other shops and restaurants.The room we booked was not the same room they showed in the picture. We stayed in a standard queen. The photo shown has a lanai. Our room was small and barely had a window. Little to no storage space, poor lighting in the room and no chair or desk.The room and bathroom was updated and clean but very small.The area is loud. We constantly heard hotel doors slamming, people talking, dogs barking, sirens driving by, busses and trucks parking and the constant beep, beep, beep sound of these trucks backing up. We had to leave the ac on all night and the tv on to help block out some noise.They have parking available for $15 a day. But be warned. The parking garage is very tight and it is difficult to get your car into some of the spots.Overall I liked the hotel (my husband did not). The staff was very friendly and helpful. If you can handle the street noise, do not need a pool, workout room or restaurant then this is the place to stay.

Thanks to APEC being in town when we were there it was a challenge to get to the hotel. She stayed on the phone until we got within sight of hotel. So on that note the hotel staff could not have been any more friendly then they were, we just loved them. The location is one block from waikiki beach!!! The room decor is done in Ikea which I love!! The hotel itself is definately older but they have updated the furniture and such so its really hip and fun. The bathroom fixtures are old but the room was very clean. They had a blow dryer, ironing board in the room as well as an Ipod dock. We had small deck but we could see the water from it even though it was only a sliver. The only downside to this place is the fact its behind the Hyatt and that happens to be the bus pick up for all the tours that go out in the area. Now depending where you are from the noise may be an issue for you. We are use to noise when we sleep plus we had the ac running in the early am so it really wasnt an issue. The windows are very old in the hotel they are the slat style and some of those wouldnt shut so you could hear the buses for sure.However that noise on the street did not make a difference to us. We would so stay there again. Waikiki was great loved seeing sunset everynight and being that close to shops, restaurants and the beach was just the best!!! This hotel is fantastic for the money if you are looking for an infinity pool on the beach this place is not for you.(they also have free wifi)I hope this helps you pick your hotel next time you are in waikiki!!

Unfortunately there were also things not to like: extremely poor room lighting, no chair or desk in room, a bathroom faucet that was very difficult to turn on, noise coming through louvered glass windows (especially the end next to Koa Avenue), deadbolts that did not work (and in fact trapped us in the room for several minutes), lanai/balcony door locks that didn't work, and finally cockroaches (a big one in the tub and a small one running across the desk right in reception).
