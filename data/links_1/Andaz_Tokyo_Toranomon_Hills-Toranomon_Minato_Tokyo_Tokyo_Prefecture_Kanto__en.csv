The staff are very accommodating, and their English speaking level is above average. There is a concierge male staff who was very helpful and he had offered many suggestions and recommendations on restaurants. The hotel is attached to a shopping mall, but the mall is quite quiet. Location of Andaz is a bit off from most of the tourists’ access spots. Taking taxi is unavoidable. The underground station is close by and depending on where you go, some popular destinations may need to change several times. I was very content staying in the Andaz and wasn’t looking too much of going else where apart from enjoying the service and its Japanese restaurant and a roof top bar!","Karon Beach, Thailand","someplaceintime</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Karon Beach, Thailand</strong>",34,4.0

As a Globalist member of Hyatt, I expected better from Andaz Tokyo, but sadly it was the worst experience I've ever had.My wife and I were snacking at the club lounge and decided to dine at the Tavern Bar and Grille Restaurant at the hotel, but upon requesting a seat, the hostess said she had no seats available. Did not even ask me how many people were dining. Looking at the restaurant, there appeared to be plenty of seats, so I confirmed again if there were any available seats, and she again reiterated there were none available.My wife and I went back to our room and decided to order room service. Before we ordered room service, I wanted to try to make a reservation one more time via phone. The hostess answered the phone and she said she had plenty of seats available. I then asked what changed between the 10 minutes between when I asked in person and when I asked over the phone. Given the sequence of events, I relayed my frustration to the both the restaurant assistant manager and the hotel duty manager. They were perfectly polite and apologetic, but given the terrible feeling my wife and had, we elected to leave the hotel immediately. We live in Tokyo, and this was supposed to be a date night.I'm not sure what sort of discrimination we experienced, but we know when discrimination is being directed against us.Not really angry, just really sad and disappointed we got treated that way.","Tokyo, Japan","hyonbos</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",0,1.0

We stayed here in January for a week in two Tokyo Tower rooms on the 50th floor. We arrived early from the UK and the rooms were ready. The views are fantastic - but as others have said the construction of the tower in front of the hotel isn't great and I worry how high its going to go - but other than the noise of the construction (they did offer, without prompting, the chance to move), it wasn't an issue for us, and we loved gazing out over the city. The rooms are excellent - great big baths and bathrooms, a very comfortable bed, superb housekeeping and good WiFi. The sound insulation is fantastic and the response times for any request was rapid. We used the hotel extensively over the week - the brilliant gym, great swimming pool, stylish sushi restaurant at the top, the burger bar on the ground floor, and the free drinks and free Haribo! There's a lovely vibe at the hotel, and the public areas have been planned very well. Breakfast was great - which we had each day, and the concierge was utterly brilliant - organising us a cookery class, laundry services and getting our bags sent ahead to our next hotel. We had dinner one night in the main restaurant - and that wasn't great at all - but that was our only bad meal of the trip.

However, things have gone downhill. I expect a copy/pasted response like every other 1-star review from them because... well, that's how much they care.1. Every time I've stayed here in the past, no matter how many times I've stayed, I've been greeted upon arrival. After checking in, I am shown my room and how to operate the various features. This is the Andaz experience, well this WAS the Andaz experience.This most recent stay, upon checking in, staff was on their phones/tablets rather than greeting guests. I had to tell the staff that I wanted to check in. No room tour on how to operate the room features. When I came into the room, there was a bottle of bleach in room left from room cleaning. It's appalling for a ""5-star"" category 7 Hyatt Andaz demanding the top room rates in Tokyo to leave cleaning supplies inside the room.2. When I went to visit the spa, I wasn't offered a tour of the spa facilities, which I have in the past. There was a foreigner man entering sauna and tub without showering and wearing shorts. Unsanitary. We reported this but the staff said ""we have signs. we have no control over our guests behavior, I'm sorry."" However this is not taking ownership of a mistake/control of the hotel's own operations but putting blame on a customer who wasn't properly educated on cultural standards. Had someone walked him through the facilities and explicitly giving him instructions, these problems could have been avoided. 3. Small details that would happen at a cheap restaurant. During breakfast, we ordered coffee from the Tavern. It didn't come. We had to follow up a few times. Just simple details that a properly trained staff would not miss. During breakfast, someone else's order came to our table. I never had refills offered on my coffee. Dirty dishes were on the table and not removed. This has never happened in the past.You can do much better at a different hotel for the same cost, i.e. Park Hyatt.","Seattle, Washington","robogar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",2,1.0

The very spacious and modern standard rooms feel like a suite, and the views are absolutely incredible. It is definitely a bit pricey, and well beyond what I normally pay for room. However, the cavernous rooms and free for all guests 'lounge' (complete with snacks, coffee, and evening wine reception), next to the lobby definitely make a base room comparable to a suite in comparable hotels. The hotel is a short walk to the Toranomon metro stop, as well Shinbashi station (which has a direct rail link to both HND and NRT, as well as countless dining/drinking options just outside the station). There is a lot of construction in this neighborhood, as it is definitely up and coming. I did hear some noise around 9 am from my room on floor 49, so factor that in if you are a late sleeper.Overall, the experience here always leaves me feeling quite energized and refreshed. The hardest part is actually getting the motivation to leave the room, and to be honest, Tokyo is one of the few cities on earth that I love just enough to actually get me out of this door.

The hotel rooms are on the top floors in the building -- I think floors 47 to 51. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by staff who escorted us and took our bags to floor 51 to check in. We then were shown to our room on the 47th floor. I don't recall ever checking in on a floor that was higher than where my room was. The room was immaculate, with terrific TV, safe, controls for blackout and sheer curtains, etc. Staff was very accommodating and helpful, especially in assisting us in forwarding luggage to our next destination. The lower floors of the building contain offices and retail, shops, restaurants. We had a delicious Japanese meal in one of the downstairs restaurants (name escapes me).

When reading reviews I take them with a grain of salt and ignore the ones with only 1 or 2 comments that are bad or good. I respect posters that have many stays and reviews.I've stayed in literally hundreds and hundreds of hotels around the world in the past 25 years and this is one of the best. The surprise was fabulous and very attentive. My wife and I stayed here 3 nights for my birthday and it was wonderful. We had room #4913 on the 49th floor and the view was incredible (see photos I took). The room was very spacious with about 600 sq. feet. The bed was very comfortable. I read some posts that mattresses in Asia tend to be hard so I requested ahead of time with the Concierge that they put a mattress pad and extra comforter and it was wonderful. My bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was huge and shower was great with strong pressure and huge soaking bathtub with plenty of room for both me and my wife.The hotel provides a happy hour from 6 PM to 8 PM with snacks, wines drinks complimentary each night. We were too stuffed to partake but it looked really great. You must take the elevator to the 52nd floor to get to the Andaz lobby and then take another elevator to go down to the rooms which are on high floors. I believe 48-51 so all the views are incredible. Everything worked well and thought out. There are plenty of plugs and USB ports all around the bedroom and next to the bed. Nothing worse than not being able to plug in. The black out blinds and shades were great and all electric and did a great job of blocking out the sunlight in the morning.We went down to the breakfast each morning in the lobby level at the restaurant and it was VERY good. As a Globalist, it was included free each morning for us. I believe it's around $40 US per person and that would be well worth it with a wide selection of buffet items and you can order 2 hot items from the menu.There are two subway lines close to the hotel. One is about 5 minutes from the hotel and the other 10 minutes. The hotel provides a ""Handy"" cellphone included free of charge with the room that has free fast internet service and you can use it with Google Maps and other programs and also has a great city guide on it. I used it throughout the stay and was great not to have to use my own cellphone with capped data while traveling. This was a great benefit that I didn't read about online before we came.WiFi worked well throughout the hotel and was very fast. The spa was very nice and is included free of charge access to it. There is a lap pool and hot tubs and sauna. The water in the hot tub was not hot. It was just luke warm to cool which would have been better if it was hotter.This is a really fabulous hotel. Room rates aren't cheap at around $800 a night with tax and fees but I loved the modern hotel with great view and fabulous service. I'd gladly come back here on my next stay.","San Diego, California","saintba</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",1394,5.0

But now I am so glad we decided to stay at there as we had an amazing experience there.First, the check-in experience was so relaxing, we hopped off the car and our host immediately sat us down at a beautiful long wooden table in the lounge area on 52nd floor and served us drinks while she explained to us all the hotel amenities and the check-in details. The hotel prepared the room so meticulously it was unbelievable. The rollaway bed for our child was setup with a cute character pillow and kids have their own bath ropes and slippers. They even provided kids sized toothbrush with kids flavored toothpaste! All the non-alcoholic drinks and snacks in the mini bar is complimentary - which is extremely generous. Everything in the room is well designed and functional. But I gotta say the view was our highlight! Our room is on the 49th floor with a panoramic of Tokyo that's almost 180 degrees (from the Imperial Palace to the Rainbow bridge). We had the Deluxe King room which is very spacious for our family of 4. The only wishlist item we had for the room was more storage drawers. We like putting away our stuff neatly instead of spreading them out on tables. Breakfast was included in our package (we booked through the AMEX FHR program). They serve breakfast at the Tavern restaurant with both Western and Japanese food. The selection was great and we can also order items from the A la Carte menu that's included with the breakfast price. Both service and food was amazing and very refined. Lastly I want to mention that because we travel with kids, it was unimaginable for us to experience a Sushi Bar Omakase meal (chef's tasting menu fine dining) but the Andaz made it happen for us! There's a sushi bar called THE SUSHI on the rooftop level that only had 8 seats which is very exclusive. The concierge arranged us to all go there. My wife and I had the Omakase while my kids can sit next to us ordering food from the Rooftop Bar menu (like wagyu burgers, fried chicken, etc) that they love. All 4 of us had a wonderful time and the sushi chef from time to time also give our kids little things to taste too.

The interior design is very classy, the rooms are spacious and well laid out, the breakfast is the best I've ever had in Japan. However, I had a rather unpleasant experience last night involving a dishonest service staff.I just checked out of the hotel last night after staying for four nights. Upon checking in, I told the front desk team member that I had a late night flight out on the last night and requested as late a check-out as possible. She told me that the hotel was very full, so she could only grant me a 2pm late check-out. I then asked if I could use the shower at the spa before leaving the hotel around midnight for the airport, and she said absolutely, and that I could also use the lobby lounge.On the last night, I went to the spa on Level 37 at around 10:30pm, only to discover that it's closed. I therefore went to the front desk, and the same team member I had spoken to during check-in attended to me. She informed me that the spa closes at 10pm. I asked if there was any way they could let me just use the shower for a while. She asked a colleague, who made a call, and then told me that they did not know how to open the shower, and the person who was in charge of it had already gone home.I was obviously disappointed to hear that. Without me asking anything, she added that she had even checked if there were any rooms I could use, but the hotel was completely sold out for the night, and even the suites were occupied. I therefore left it as that, and decided to go to the airport lounge to shower instead.However right after the conversation, I was fiddling with my phone and out of curiosity went to my Hyatt app to check the availability of rooms that night (August 13th). To my surprise, I saw that rooms were available at Andaz on the night itself, and at relatively decent rates! I clicked further and found that there were three room types available (meaning there were at least three unoccupied rooms) - 2 twin beds, 1 king bed with bay view, and Andaz suite with 2 king beds.In other words, the front desk staff basically LIED to me. And she voluntarily came up with this lie intentionally as it didn't even cross my mind to ask to use the shower in one of the rooms. This is especially shocking in Japan, where people are generally very honest. Such dishonest behavior is just unacceptable. I'm not sure how I can bring myself to return to the hotel and have to constantly question the honesty and integrity of the staff. Most disappointing.","Singapore, Singapore","ChesterChua</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",40,2.0

Globalists get the choice of a hot entree (including a Japanese set option) with the buffet spread.The location is conveniently a short walk away from the Toranomon station. Coming from the airport, it is easy to take a train to Tokyo station, then take a taxi ride to the hotel. A conbini is also a short walk away if you needed cheap eats or late night snacks.In typical Andaz style, this property embodies casual-luxury where the hard product is supreme. Do not expect super hands on service - I would recommend some other property like the Park Hyatt if you need a lot of specialty/concierge services.

The concierge said, “The Bell Desk downstairs speak English, they can tell the taxi driver for you.” In all honesty, most Concierge would just write the address and not be lazy about it. - Concierge: Asked to call a restaurant to confirm a reservation and to kindly leave a message in my room with an update. He insisted I wait for him to make the call even though I told him I’m running late. It’s not a big issue but it’s small service issues which shouldn’t happen with a Concierge at a luxury hotel. - Taxi Stand: most hotels have a separate line for hotel guests, Andaz only have one line shared with the Mori Toranomon Hills building. Therefore, as a hotel guest you may have to wait a while sometimes for a taxi. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and will definitely return.

We arrived at Haneda International Airport and took a 20min ride on the Airport Limousine Shuttle straight to Andaz Tokyo (so convenient!). Instead of waiting in line at a reception table, when we got to the hotel lobby we were seated in the Andaz Lounge where we could help ourselves to drinks, refreshments, snacks (…and a donut wall with matcha flavoured donuts - WIN) and before we knew it it was time to check-in. We stayed in the Andaz Tower View King Room which gave us the most incredible view of the Tokyo Tower and cityscape and the bed was strategically positioned to take full advantage of the view. The bedroom was beautifully designed (sort of like a modern and miminal ryokan) with plenty of space for us to comfortably store our luggage, hang our clothes and lounge around in the hotel’s yukata and slippers.The bed itself is extremely comfortable with all the master switches and blind controls right beside the bedhead..and can I just take a quick moment to appreciate the futuristic toilet seat that was always perfectly heated with automatic open, flush and beyond? It makes going home to our regular toilet a very sad reality hahahaThe minibar also had complementary snacks and non-alcoholic beverages and we were ADDICTED to the wasabi rice crackers!Location-wise, the hotel is quite central and easily accessible (7min walk from the Tokyo Metro and 10mins from the JR Shimbashi). However, the area is a quiet business district which was perfect for us because we wanted to stay somewhere a bit quieter at night.The staff here are also extremely attentive and helpful. At check-in we were given a run-down of the closest sights and and transport options and every request was resolved or answered almost immediately. The hotel prides itself on service and we can definitely see why. And let's not forget one of the most important things - BREAKFAST! The breakfast buffet at Andaz Tokyo is truly one of a kind! Not only does the breakfast dining area occupy a panoramic view floor of the building - the food is exquisite. Andaz Tokyo Toranomon Hills Pastry Shop is also located on ground floor and the fresh pastries are brought up to the breakfast buffet so you basically have a bakery at your fingertips each morning!It’s also quite difficult to find vegetarian options in Japan but with an extravagant buffet spread and diverse ready-to-order menu, there were plenty of vegetarian friendly dishes for me :)Overall, our stay at Andaz Tokyo was true luxury and we definitely felt very well looked after, well fed and well rested in a great location.The only thing we're sad about is that we didn't get enough time to use the pool and spa but we hope to next time we're back!","Sydney, Australia","anniesbucketlist</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",36,5.0

The hotel lobby is on the 51st floor with views in each direction, including the Tokyo Tower. Each day snacks and drinks were placed in the lobby for guests to enjoy. The offerings were rotated based on the time of day. Checking in is informal with guests asked to take a seat whilst staff take care of the check in. The room was very clean and so spacious. The entry /closet area of the room has great storage. The bathroom is a wet room with shower and large sunken bath. The toilet is in a seperate room and features a Japanese style electric toilet. As we were travelling with a young child and a baby, cute tiger themed items were provided for our children. A full size cot was also provided on request with baby amenities, including a nappy/diaper bin in the bathroom. Housekeeping was excellent and replenished towels regularly. Dinner at the Tavern was just perfection. Expensive but the food is delicious. The children’s bento meal provided to our daughter was fantastic.

The location is inconvenient, the service is lacking, and the room service was subpar. I just returned from a week in Tokyo, where I split my nights between the Peninsula (4) and the Andaz (3). The Andaz is simply not on the same level as the Peninsula, and here’s why. Upon arriving at the Andaz by taxi, our bags were unloaded to the curb, and the attendant disappeared before we could pay and exit the cab. We waited several minutes before someone returned to assist. After a very slow check-in, we waited in our room for a good 10 minutes before our bags arrived, which the attendant simply placed inside the door in the foyer, instead of the closet. At the Peninsula, you’re made to feel like Royalty. Everything is so smooth and efficient, our bags beat us to our room and were waiting in the exceptionally large closet. The Andaz lacks a front desk. When we arrived, we looked around an empty lobby for a couple of minutes before getting the attention of an attendant who ultimately checked us in. Multiple times during the process, she got up and left without any expectation setting of how long she’d be away, or what she was doing. At the Peninsula, we were escorted across the lobby to the front desk, for a quick and efficient check-in. We were then escorted to our room and given a brief tour of the many amenities. The room at the Andaz is new, and features a nice view. The amenities were lacking for such a new hotel. There were no USB ports next to the bed. There is no mood lighting or dimming, and many of the lights are connected in a way that limits control. In the closet/foyer, it’s basically all or nothing with lighting. The Peninsula is older, but the room and ambience is vastly superior. Each nightstand features multiple USB ports and plugs. The entire room can be controlled by panels on either side of the bed. Each light switch features “mood” settings, which dim the lights to a soft golden glow. The Andaz layout is strange where the foyer is oversized, the closet is small, and the actual room is also quite small. This is made worse with a couch that cuts across the entire window, blocking some of the view you’d otherwise see. The room service at the Andaz was significantly more affordable than the Peninsula, but the quality was terrible. When we asked for an ice bucket to chill a bottle of wine, it took about 20 minutes to receive a tiny ice bowl with tongs. I again asked for a bucket, which would fit the bottle of wine. Again, a 20 minute wait. The pool and spa is extremely nice at the Andaz, but the service is totally lacking. I mean that literally, there’s virtually no service when you go to the pool. The Peninsula has a beautiful pool and staff is always on hand to assist with anything you need. The location of the Andaz is inconvenient if you’re planning to adventure and return to the hotel at all during the day. The subway is a far enough walk that it’s not convenient, and taxis rarely know where the hotel is. When we did get taxis downstairs, the staff failed to help in giving the driver instructions. Instead we had to pull out our phones each time and wait for the driver to figure out where we were going. I know much of what I’m pointing out is a luxury, and of course I don’t expect these things at every hotel I visit. However, Tokyo 5 Star Hotel experiences can truly be something special, and I think it’s notable that the Andaz is not. It’s just a nice Hyatt. If you’re used to other Hyatt’s, you’ll probably think this is fine. If you have the chance to stay at the Peninsula, I wouldn’t even bother wasting a night at the Andaz. At least four our visit, the two hotels were the same price. We felt like we got a great value at the Peninsula, and we were ripped off at the Andaz.

We stayed a week, and a lovely week at that. It felt like home, even though our actual home looks nothing like the hotel. The attitude and the personable manner of the service staff was very welcoming - as if they understood how the place and the design could feel intimidating to some people so they amp up the personal touch. There's a small spread for guests in the lobby (aka living room?) in the morning and evening. It wasn't a huge buffet, but we started looking forward to it after a few days, if only to sit or grab a soda. Also nice that they have cappuccinos in to-go cups anytime of the day. I was even able to take an entire gallon (liter?) of orange juice to the room when I wasn't feeling well.Our room was design-y without being impractical (ok, a bathroom door did get in the way of the dresser or the fridge, but that's nitpicking. Also the hotel was quite generous with wood panelling. It was everywhere. Someone must really like wood).The bed was comfortable, next to it were light and window controls. We had a desk, a bench, a coffee table and still lots of room to stretch out and walk around. The large bathroom had a shower and a soaking tub (it was mirrored, we didn't use it). Coffee, snacks, and some drinks were complimentary from the mini-fridge, and there was also a free 'handy' phone for us to use during our stay. Tip: you can use it as hotspot if you'd rather use your own cell phone.The amenity set was beautifully presented. Yukatas (for two) and slippers were in the closet. They had a number of toiletries that they can send to room or purchase for you.Outside, the lobby, the hallways, the restaurant, and lobby furniture contributed to a modern yet cozy feeling. It felt Japanese yet international. The spa/pool floor was a wonderful place to spend some free time. Lots of baths with jets and at various temperatures, with shower amenities and an attendant present.There was one subway stop next to the hotel, and others a few minutes away. It may be less accessible by public transport than others, but the trade-offs are worth the walk or cab ride. A walk to Ginza or the Imperial Palace was only 15-20 minutes, bordering some parks and greenery, too.","New York City, New York","ezraulo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",26,5.0

What was less than perfect was the overworked and slightly disorganized front desk/concierge. Small hiccups like not getting a call back from the concierge's desk when I asked for help confirming my onward flight; when I called back 15 minutes later the operator said that the concierges were still helping other guests, which is possible but honestly it seemed more likely that they don't have a way of according guests who call the same priority as guests who show up in person at the concierge desk. When I called back the operator at least took my flight details but after a further 10 minutes elapsed with I ended up calling the airline myself; while I was on the line with the airline, the concierge called back to say he had contacted the airline. Similarly, checkout left a bit to be desired: I found myself standing with 3 other people waiting for the single reception clerk, until a second one showed up - this was at checkout time, so it is hard to understand why only one receptionist would be there. There were other small signs that staff, while unfailingly pleasant and evidently eager to please, were simply overworked; indeed, a couple of employees confirmed this to me in separate informal conversations. None of the very minor glitches I encountered during my brief stay left me in tears or indeed seriously detracted in any way from my time at the hotel, but they ought to be addressed by management.","Brussels, Belgium","John R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brussels, Belgium</strong>",14,4.0

We had heard that it was popular for its design. The other 2 hotels we were considering were the Parky Hyatt and the Aman, so take that into consideration when reading this review. There is not a surface that is not touched in this hotel--even the ceiling panels in the restaurant are lacquered. The public areas are interestingly designed, but it seems like value engineering resulted in cheaper materials being used. i would have preferred better materials used more sparingly. The result, to me, is a bit theme park-ish. The rooms are very comfortable. I love the long built in sofa along the window wall, which allows for both desk and living room seating. There are old school flip switches for the lights and blinds, which give it a retro feel. There is a nod to Nakashima in much of the furniture (sofa, chairs, tables with butterfly details). The bathroom has a huge tub and shower, and the dressing room is nicely appointed with yukatas and japanese slippers. However, the entry area is cluttered with too much furniture and too many shiny surfaces, which results in a bit of an obstacle course.Service: the desk-less reception experience is meant to provide a speedy check in for guests. This is not the case in Japan. Both our check-in and check-out were much longer than was necessary. I think we got the manager for both, and perhaps he is a temporary staff person?

We had heard that it epitomized the best in new hotel design, and had surpassed the Park Hyatt as the new 'it' hotel. I liked the design overall, but the materials felt a bit cheap. I think the design could have been edited more, so that more $ could have been spent on the areas that mattered. The rooms were very comfortable. I liked the wall to wall sofa at the window wall, that allowed for both desk and living room seating. I liked the wall panelling, which recalls rice paper screens. The entry way and bathroom together take up a lot of square footage. I think there is wasted space in the entry--the number of components that are there make it feel a bit like an obstacle course. The bathroom is well appointed, but could use a second sink. The wet room is very nice, with its oversized round tub. Also a nice touch is being able to access the walk in closet from both the bathroom and the entry hall--but this is not a necessity. Again, I would rather have a second sink than this feature.Service:The service at this hotel makes it feel like a 3 star hotel.

In the heart of the most intense city in the world, on the fifty-first floor is an oasis. Stepping out of the cab, my bags were taken by a welcoming team, and I was escorted to a pair of automatic doors leading to a richly paneled elevator lobby that wisked me to the hotel lobby. This is not your father’s Hyatt. When you step out of the elevator, you will likely be greeted by a team member inviting you to a drink in the lounge. I had the great fortune of arriving during happy hour, where there was an array of wines an appetizers in a very comfortable lounge area. There is no registration desk or check in counter. Team members bring registration to you while you sit comfortably. After this easy checkin, I was shown to my fiftieth floor room. It was night when I arrived and the room had an amazing view of the Tokyo skyline. But that was nothing compared to the next morning, awaking to a crystal clear view of Mt. Fuji.The room itself was not big, but I am sure there is a great variety of rooms. The bathroom, however...well phenomenal!!!Andaz takes service to a high level. They don’t ‘nickel and dime’. The lounge has complimentary snacks and beverages all day. Mini-bars include snacks and non-alcoholic beverages complimentary, and a few alcoholic drinks if you like.room controls for drapes, lights etc are advanced. But the essence of the room cannot be conveyed in a post. The room itself, like the rest of the public areas of the hotel, is a showcase of carved wood art; yet warm and welcoming.Food in the restaurant was very good, and no detail overlooked in service. Special call out to team member Thomas who took great joy in meeting and talking to as many guests as possible, and ensuring that every need was met, every desire exceeded.Location is convenient. I’ll warn you, this hotel is not inexpensive. It is a five star hotel in the heart of an expensive city. I’ve stayed at other hotels in the area, but from now on, I will only be staying at the Andaz.Thank you Andaz team for a fantastic stay.","Agoura Hills, California","Steven G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Agoura Hills, California</strong>",13,5.0

There are 2 nearby subway station that takes ~10mins walking (including time to get through hotel).Amenities: there are always drinks and snacks set out in the lobby area, such as fresh fruit and chocolate croissants in the morning, hairabo gummies and sweets in the afternoon. Globalists get breakfast at the Tavern. Canapes are set out for 2 hours with a bartender shaking up a signature drink with wine and a Kyoto beer in the evening. Two refrigerators as well as a full coffee/tea set is tucked in the back for access anytime. Lap pool is gorgeous along with full access to separate steam and whirlpools at the spa.

The metro station Toranomon is a pleasant short walk (a few hundred metres) away. A short ride takes you to all the famous areas of the vast city with Ginza being ”next door”. In the immediate proximity to the hotel there are also residential properties, lots of restaurants (if you explore the side streets) and the ever present fabulous convenience stores which really live up to their name. Visiting them are an important part of the travel experience and is highly recommended!The hotel occupies level 37 (spa, pool and gym) and levels 47-51 (rooms, suites, lobby and restaurants) in the 52-storey Mori Tower in the mixed-used development Toranomon Hills. The hotel offers terrific views over Tokyo and gives you a real sense of the size of this metropolitan area which stretches as far as you can see. I stayed in a room facing the Imperial Garden and (in the far distance) the Tokyo Skytree and it was one of the most impressing views I have ever seen! Since the tower is considerably taller than the surrounding buildings the view from all the public areas are equally jaw-dropping.The interior design is restrained, elegant, minimalist, has a cool modern vibe and incorporates Japanese design elements. The room was very well appointed with a huge round bathtub, amenitys with seasonal fragrances (went from summer to fall during my stay), a very comfortable bed, complimentary minibar (excluding items with alcohol) and house-keeping was impressively metoculous. In the lounge area adjacent to the lobby complimentary beverages and snacks are available throughout the day with a choice of wine and canapés in the evening. The main restaurant serves a beautiful and delicious breakfast buffet with Japanese and Western food. Try the Japanese breakfast items with grilled fish, rice, miso soup and pickles! The gym is large, has great views and is better equipped than most hotel gyms. The lap pool is equally wonderful.The staff throughout the hotel offers attentive thoughtful service and really makes you feel welcome. The breakfast staff, lounge hosts and spa/pool/gym staff deserve a special mention but in fact everyone you meet is delightful.In summary, if you have the opportunity to stay here I highly recommend it! As with all luxury hotels you need to spend an extravagant amount of money. Here you get very good value for your spending.Swimming in the pool high above the city after a day of exploring fantastic Tokyo, followed by a glas of wine in the lounge, is a luxurious vacation memory I am very fortunate to have!","Gothenburg, Sweden","Mikael_1977</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gothenburg, Sweden</strong>",10,5.0

All four Andaz stays have been excellent, and I'm looking to try additional properties in the future.Our time at Andaz Tokyo was the result of a family vacation. When booking the trip, I noticed the Andaz was really the only Hyatt property in Japan that allowed guestroom occupancy for three. Knowing the strict enforcement of the occupancy limits in Japanese hotels, this was a huge benefit. The hotel is part of a much larger complex, but I didn't find the entrances difficult to manage at all. Yes, you do need to travel up to the 51st floor lobby, and transfer to an elevator down to your room. However, having the hotel at the very top of one of Tokyo's highest building, with spectacular views the guestrooms, is absolutely worth that minor inconvenience. We found the staff to be very helpful. Any requests, including an evening room refresh, were met promptly. The décor and finishes are really well done. We found the entire experience very impressive. The location is 10 minutes from several subway lines, which we didn't find difficult. It's also within walking distance of the Imperial Palace area. There are a number of convenience stores in the immediate neighborhood, and the tower contains numerous restaurants and a great convenience store in the lower floors.Thank you Tokyo Andaz for a really fine experience.",,mk72759,55,5.0

The check-in experience was impersonal - we were sat in a waiting area with no windows. Every other hotel we’ve stayed in had an impressive lobby with a view so this was odd. To be fair the Park Hyatt check-in was in a room with no windows but the one-on-one service and the walk through the lobby made a difference. The room itself was quite nice and the bathroom was the best I’ve experienced. Some weird design elements in the room brought it down. A giant wooden table in front of the window made the room seem small (even though it wasn’t) and blocked the view. Additionally, the walls folded in to cover a foot of the window on either side, also making the room seem smaller. ",,Paul S,1,3.0

Hotel ended up being one of our favorites! Concierge service was fantastic and helped us find a fantastic private guide for 1.5 days. We booked two deluxe rooms with the Tokyo tower and rooms are new (2014) with very nice bathrooms. Very functional. We loved the sofa which was more like a window seat. Service was great and there is a fantastic workout area with views. The location is off the beaten path a bit but we loved it as we learned to navigate the subway system and used car service to get to the train station with bags etc. The bar is fantastic with great views and a nice casual menu. We did the fine dining one night and it was delicious but of course expensive but again we thought appropriate to the value of the quality, view, and service. Rooftop bar is nice but the view from our rooms and the lobby bar was just as nice. Since the hotel is at the top of the building it feels like a hidden gem from street level. Thank you Andaz!

So this time my review would be more focused on things the traveller can/should do to better enjoy their time at the hotel.Take note that you're staying at a boutique hotel in Tokyo, so it definitely isn't one meant for you to stay at if your pure intentions are to explore all of Tokyo, and find a place to return to after a whole day of exploration. Although the location of the hotel is comfortably well within walking distance of both JR, and Tokyo Metro, if not there are always taxis you can take downstairs. In my image, the purpose of the hotel is for you to enjoy a lazy morning, followed by a brief outing, then returning by sunset to enjoy the breathtaking view from either your room or the rooftop bar (you should definitely take advantage of the free cover charge as a staying guest).For mornings there, take advantage of gym (although it would be best to avoid it from 8-10AM, from my experience people go there specifically to take pictures and not work out), the swimming pool, and the hot tub in the locker rooms.For those who are there to seek the amazing view of Tokyo, as with most Andaz hotels around the world, they offer room upgrades (via email) a few days prior to your check-in. Generally I pass on these offers as I don't really care what view I get now, but if you want a view of Tokyo Towers, go ahead and take the offer for a great view at night.While I admit the bathtub orientation is a bit odd (a round bathtub doesn't quite make sense without jet streams), the seasonal bath salts that they provide definitely make it worth while to bathe in the tub at least once during your stay (currently its summer bamboo). The silver lining of the bathtub situation could be that there is no emergency drain at the top of the bathtub, so feel free to will it to the brim and be completely submerged in it (don't waste too much water though).All in all, Andaz Tokyo Toranomon maintains its excellent service despite the recent influx of tourists entering Tokyo. My suggestion to the hotel would be to increase the employee amount during check-in/out hours, while to those that are considering staying at this hotel...to arrive before check-in time, drop off your luggage, and go out and explore Tokyo for your first day before...and then returning around 4-5pm (that way you avoid the 3pm check-in rush) with hopes that your room will be ready and suitcases have already been delivered to your room.","Tokyo, Japan","TokyoEats128</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",7,5.0

A great room with dark wood accents, nice seating area next to the bed, with magnificent view of Tokyo. Nice welcome amenity of tasty eclairs from the Pastry Shop. And free minibar and snacks plus Nespresso, except for alcohol.Bathroom was very nice also with seasonal amenities in a Japanese bento box styled layout. Huge circular soaking tub next to rain shower, and a nice Toto washlet.Weird to have dark wood for the sink surface, but it’s beautiful although one crack has already soaked up some water and started to buckle - so may need to be resealed soon.Lovely breakfast buffet at the Tavern, with great fruit selection and small but decent offerings from western and Asian cuisine. You can also 2 items from the a la Carte menu. I’ve never had eggs Benedict on croissant before - interesting! Again, heat view and great service, but could be a bit of a wait for the excellent espresso drinks.Had drinks and snacks at the Rooftop Bar. Nice space, good music, some cool spaces to hang out, diverse and hip crowd of young professionals. Had some sushi in the small bar that maybe seats 8 at most, and karaage and sake outside in the breezeway lounge overlooking the night time lights of Tokyo.Great infinity pool at the AO spa with great city views. The locker room wet areas are nothing special - so chose to use the hot tub at the pool area instead.The only negative is the location. Toranomon Hills is a new development still under construction area the neighborhood, and the nearest metro station is still a good 3+ blocks away walking thru a narrow alley with lots of people on tight sidewalks — I had to walk on the street most days. And the walk to the taxi area is crazy long — you can see the taxi stand thru the glass wall. but you have all the way down long hallway to get there. The porters could at least see you coming, and offer to help you a few minutes later.Also the floor logistics is crazy: from the closest entrance from Metro at 2F, you have to first take the escalator down a floor to 1F, and then take elevator to 51F, in order to check in and then have to take another elevator to your room and the AO spa.Summary: great view from nice rooms, good service esp at the Tavern. But not the best location to easily get around town.","Oakland, California","jfk2sgo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland, California</strong>",4,4.0

About 5 minutes later we had our keys in hand and were escorted once again to our King room on the floor below.The room was modern, large and comfortable with a fantastic view of Tokyo Tower. The bathroom was large with a soaking tub and shower segregated from the sink area. As with other Andaz properties, the non-alcoholic beverages and snacks in the minibar were complimentary and included local options in addition to the typical Coca-Cola products. The internet in the room was complimentary, fast and reliable.The location of the hotel was easily accessible via a short cab ride from Tokyo Station (about 1000 yen). We only had one night at the property so did not explore the area much. We did walk from the hotel to the Tsukiji fish market and back. I wouldn’t describe it as an easy walk, but it was a nice morning and with comfortable shoes, was doable.The property always offered complimentary water or juice in the lobby as well as fresh fruit. We didn’t have a meal during our short stay at this property but we did have a drink at the rooftop bar on the 52nd floor. The bar is enclosed so you are sheltered from the elements and offers fantastic views of Tokyo. The only negative about this property was the need to use multiple elevators r to get from one place to another.

The Andaz does not have concierges, as apparently they consider all their employees to be 'hosts,' and any of them can help. While this is a novel concept, a true 5 star concierge is a local EXPERT - has amazing contacts, and can truly listen to a guests requests/desires, and make specific recommendations. We had a lot of interaction with the hotel in setting up restaurant reservations (they did a great job, as we had a very specific list), but beyond that, it was very obvious that they were just recommending from a list of 'approved' recommendations.

Just skip the sushi restaurant on the top floor, it's not worth it and there are far better options in the city.The one negative of this hotel is location, especially if you're coming for leisure: it is a business area so there is nothing to do around and the subway is several blocks away, so keep in mind that it's not Shinjuku.All in all, it was absolutely phenomenal and I would look forward to staying there again.","New York City, New York","clem92</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",2,5.0

Of course, one of those perspectives we wanted to see was an experience of luxury, premium and comfort. As a side note, we needed a good home base to get prepared for our engagement shoot (we needed space to get makeup and hair prepared). First of all, the location of the Andaz epitomizes the idea of how success and luxury go hand-in-hand. I am only mentioning this because for our first impression walking in was entering amongst an atmosphere of many driven, business dressed individuals. The Andaz is in the same building of other companie(s) where we regularly saw people in business attire whenever venturing out during our stay. Of course, the Andaz itself exceeded our expectations on every level and I can summarize it with three main parts: 1. Staff Interaction, 2. Room amenities, 3. Food & Beverage. 1. Staff Interaction at Tokyo Andaz was inviting, welcoming and responsive. We really felt like they cared about us. From a welcome drink during check-in to a thorough explanation of all the room features (there were plenty!), we definitely felt very welcome. They even made it seamless for us by booking our airport shuttles at check-out! Oh and I almost forgot, complimentary happy-hour where our cups were never empty! Nice one, Andaz family!2. Room amenities were among the best we've seen. In-room Japanese snacks and beverages were a nice touch. Of course, our favorite things about the room were the rainfall shower, spacious tub, Bose Soundlink speaker and premium Toilet bidet. The room was also perfect for my fiancée to get ready for our photoshoot. It was spacious enough for her to get her makeup and hair done and also included various mirrors (vanity, full-length, close-up) Also, as an amateur photographer myself, the view of Tokyo Tower was a bonus!3. Food & Beverage could be found in the same building and in surrounding area. We loved the Toranamon Koffee shop to start off our adventures and the in-building Family Mart for our convenience needs. There were also in-building restaurant options that we regret our never-ending adventures didn’t give us enough time to try. We did however try some local ramen easily found in the surrounding area and it was delicious! All transportation options were easily available, from taxi to nearby subway. We humbly opted for the latter for our adventures with no problem.Lastly, we’ve be fortunate to have stayed at Andaz Maui and now Andaz Tokyo. To compare the two would be like comparing Excellent with Excellent. I will say that the top-notch experience was consistent through both, although I may have to give the overall to Andaz Tokyo a very slight edge. Like comparing an Lamborghini to a Ferrari, it really stems from personal preference. Still would love to go back to either.Overall recommend for the best hotel experience that hands-down sets the bar for other hotel experiences and is worth the splurge. We hope we are fortunate to be able to stay again!","Carson, California","432jeromer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carson, California</strong>",2,5.0

The lobby is very spacious with lots of tables and seating for guests to relax. The hotel hosts a daily happy hour with wine, sake, and a few light hor d'oeuvres. There is also mini pastries and juice every morning. There is also coffee bar and refrigerator stocked with juice, sodas, and water 24/7 for guests, which we thoroughly appreciated after a long day of sightseeing and exploring the city.The room was excellent and had a great configuration where we never felt cramped. The guest rooms are located on floors 47 - 50 of the building with great views. There are also free non-alcoholic beverages and snacks from the mini bar, which was a pleasant surprise. The only minor consideration is the location. As others have mentioned, the hotel is located in the financial district, so the weekends do quiet down substantially. If you plan on taking public transportation, it's about a six minute walk from the subway line and a 10 minute walk to the closest JR rail (Shimbashi) station.

Our room had a very nice clear view of Tokyo Tower. Younger clientele would enjoy this hotel more - it is 'casual' and 'hip' and unstuffy. ///Breakfast I remember last year when I came to Andaz, I really enjoyed the selection of items they had at the buffet. This time around the food was very limited and the selection seemed to have little or no rotation (food sat there for a while), which shows that other guests weren't pleased with the selection either. Last year they had premium grilled fish like miso glazed black cod but this time around it was more standard salmon or mackerel.///The RoomLast year our suite faced the Tower and there was a reflection of the sun from one of the buildings that glared directly into our suite making it extremely bright. It was uncomfortable during the day. We had to keep the blinds drawn most of the time.The room had a modern circular bathtub in the shower. I enjoyed the waterfall rain head and dorn bracht faucets. The layout was a little awkward with the mirrored folding doors but I appreciated the design risk they took. They were skimpy on the products (only left one shampoo, didn't refill for turndown) and the bath products were not a well known brand like The Peninsula (Oscar de la Renta) or Shangri La (Bulgari Green Tea). The room did not have enough table space for two people to comfortably eat together. ///The LobbyThe lobby area was nice and airy with high ceilings. They had cocktail hour where there would be live music playing at the bar and some wine and little chips that you could enjoy at the lobby.  ///The Lobby RestaurantWe rarely got service with a smile at the Andaz. I had some business contacts come over for drinks and dinner at the lobby restaurant and the server was rude. He was very unhappy serving us. The food was just OK, it was nothing special but the price would seem it should be. ///The LocationThere was a lot of construction around the Andaz last year and now it seems like there is even more construction. Taxi drivers in Tokyo rarely knew where the Andaz hotel was so we had to ask for 'Toranomon Hills' but they wouldn't know how to get into the building so we kept being dropped off on the side across from the 'car entry'. We would have to cross the road and then the guards at the car entry wouldn't allow pedestrians to enter through the 'car entry' but you could literally see the door to the hotel 3m away. We would have to walk around the block to the street entry and walk down the hallway back to the hotel entry (a giant U). I'm all for safety and rules but this was a bit nonsensical. The car entry area is shared by the Toranomon Hills building so the Taxi Stand is shared too. At other five star hotels the valet would ask us where we were going and translate it to the driver for accuracy, which we appreciate very much. At the Andaz we asked the valet if he could translate this address for us and he just pointed to the taxi driver saying we should do it ourselves. I did not like this at all and we ended up being dropped off at a completely random location across the bridge from our 3 michelin star sushi restaurant, and had to walk 10 blocks in the rain (and we were dressed to dine at a 3-michelin star restaurant). We were wet from the rain, and late (a big no-no). There isn't much food to eat around the restaurant and it is very quiet around the hotel. It is a 10 minute walk to the subway through residential/side streets.///The SpaThe pool, gym and spa is beautiful and views from there are awesome. I loved going for a dip in the pool and whirlpool and my husband enjoyed the gym. ///CheckoutOn the day of our checkout, we asked for the bellboys to come to get our luggage. We waited 15 minutes and no one came so we called again. They said they were coming and waited another 15 minutes. We called down again and they said they were coming and waited another 15. At the 45 minute mark we got up and took our luggage on our own and bumped into the bellboy in the hallway.///ConclusionPricing is great so I would come back here again if I'm on business.","Toronto, Canada","Jaime K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",25,3.0

The service is great without being as overt as it is at other luxury brands (e.g. Park Hyatt). So if you are looking for a little more laid back vibe, this is an excellent choice. Pros: incredible design, sublime decor, coolest spa facilities, spacious rooms, perfect service, location is great (quiet but close to subways). Cons: I have only one complaint. It will seem weird that this is the longest part of the review. I want to be clear that I LOVED this hotel, and in the grand scheme, my complaint did not deter from a great stay. I just do not understand why this choice was made by the designer. Every other detail in this hotel is made with intention. This must have been too. I just do not understand why. One of the coolest attributes of this hotel is that it is on the ~50th floor. Soaring views of one of the greatest cities in the world. Floor to ceiling windows are so dramatic when you are up this high. The problem is that in the regular/view rooms, the beautiful and elegant wall panels turn in about a half meter as they meet the windows. Instead of having windows that go the full width of the room, the panels shrink that by about a meter. Why???? On top of that, there is a couch facing inward, backing up to the windows that is the full width of the room. For two people in the room, a couch this long is not needed at all. And what it does is act as another obstruction of the view, and even worse, a barrier. What’s the best thing about floor to ceiling windows on the 50th floor? Walking right up to them! Can’t do that in these rooms. You can jump over the back of the couch, but I just can’t figure out why there needs to be a full width couch in this room. Tip: to remedy this problem, upgrade to the “Large” king rooms. No obstructions. Just huge windows and soaring views.

Then after returning from 3 nights in Kyoto, we stayed another 6 nights. Both arrivals were smooth with quick and efficient check in. I had ordered a pocket wifi and it was already placed in our room prior to check-in upon our first stay. We checked two large suitcases with the hotel while we were away in Kyoto and those were also placed in our room prior to our second check-in, along with a nice welcome back note and tasty macarons. Both stays I had reserved a King Tower view room and the views were stunning! Seeing the Tokyo Tower lit up every night was breathtaking and the vast bird’s eye view of Tokyo was mesmerizing! The hotel is beautifully designed, with lots of natural wood and clean lines. We dined at the Tavern bar and the Tavern restaurant a few times and were happy with service and food. Our experience with hotel staff was excellent. We were almost always greeted by name and we used many of their restaurant recommendations. They were happy to make reservations for us, and never hesitated at any of our requests. The hotel is located in a quiet, business part of Tokyo, with a short walk to the subway station. We appreciated being able to get away from the hectic city in our quiet room. My only complaint would be the bed…I found the mattress to be overly firm. I prefer a more plush hotel bed experience. The room was gorgeous, smartly designed and spacious for Tokyo. Nespresso machines in the room were fantastic and non-alcoholic drinks and snacks were free.

Looking at different directions you can see the Sky Tree, the Royal Palace, Shinjuku (and on a clear day, Mountain Fuji) and of course Tokyo bay and Tokyo Tower. It was such an amazing experience to close all the lights in our room and immerse ourselves in the glittering night of Tokyo. And to wake up in the morning with Tokyo Tower and Mountain Fuji in front of your eyes. That experience alone is worth the splurge.On top of that, the Andaz has a charming, modern yet very Japanese style and the pool and spa is such a retreat -- so far, so good. The people at the Andaz are generally very professional and warm, and speak very good English. They explained everything in great detail and were very attentive to detail.But then here comes the negatives (it's only my personal feeling): first,I'm not a fan of the lounge concept -- especially during CI -- the lounge area barely offers limited selection of drinks and little snacks (not replenished very often) and is not close to any windows, and the seat is not really very comfortable -- I mean, for God's sake this is Tokyo and if I can't get to my room immediately, I know a million of choices that are more comfortable than the lounge. And the 'lounge' concept also means we need to wait on 52F with our luggages by our side, instead of leaving our luggages to the concierge on the ground floor. Sure, we can 'help ourselves' but it's more like a youth hotel than an upscale property. Not to mention that the lounge is so much inferior to any club lounge of the 'ordinary' luxury hotels -- alright, we know this is not a club lounge so that's fine.The dining options are not particularly strong as well. Honestly the bar, the Tavern and the sushi bar are not very tempting for us because the view of our room was much better and the food they offer were nothing outstanding for Tokyo. (especially when you compare them to the excellent restaurants of Ritz Hong Kong) I really appreciate the free mini bar, but we only ended up using the bottled water -- we didn't need the coke and diet coke; the free snacks are great, but were, again, nothing outstanding for Tokyo. (I know, the feeling of having a free mini bar in an expensive hotel is so much more important than having the mini bar itself)All in all, the Andaz is exquisitely designed (kudos to the designer) and some of the most stunning views you can have in Tokyo, but on the other side, feels like a help-your-self private sight-viewing room (with a luxury pool and sauna). For sight-viewing, this is the best so I still recommend this hotel but after a few days the dazzling view becomes a little boring and for prolonged stay I will consider staying at the Prince Gallery just a few blocks away. This is not to say that the Andaz is not good -- we are grateful we were there -- but there are more comfortable options out there.","Incheon, South Korea","myst_haidian</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Incheon, South Korea</strong>",28,4.0

Our encounters with Andaz hosts were below expectations. They are better than receptionist at GH Tokyo but way below Concierge and Grand Club Team at GH Tokyo. (1) got my restaurant reservation wrong, no private room reserved. (2) when I ask a host to send 2 bucket of ice during night turn down at 5plus in the evening and he was so confident and tell me just call and the ice bucket will be delivered. I told him your customer required 2 bucket of ice to be delivered during night turn down. When I return to hotel at 7.15pm, neither the room was turned down, no ice buckets too. I told him off. I was waiting at the lounge for Housekeeping to turn down, no one come to apologise and no on come to tell me that the room was turned down. (3) when I told them to book a taxi to Haneda for me tomorrow leaving hotel at 1pm, they asked for my flight information. Isn’t leaving hotel at 1pm enough ? They went further to ask me for reservation confirmation number. I think they may ask me for my back account number next, just to book a taxi. No explanation on why such details are required. I am really not a fan of this Andaz Host thing. Housekeeping is the second best in Asia, after GH Tokyo. Very very good. One incident which if they have done better, they will be the best. I broke a porcelain glass and cut my feet in the room. The slipper was stained with blood. Both items are placed next to the waste paper basket in the toilet.

Worse of all, the hotel staff assumed we will be ‘out’ the second day between 12noon and 3pm (since check out time is 12noon and check in time is 3pm) and we needed to pack our luggage and deposit the key at the front desk so that they can move us on the second day to the new room.

The area around the hotel has definitely picked up and there are more options for food and activities nearby that make it more appealing to travelers. I wish I could say the service was just as awesome as we remembered it. Unfortunately that was not the case and it left a bad experience for us. We were staying for a few days and had breakfast in the restaurant. Unfortunately, dealing with jetlag we overslept and came near the end of breakfast. Now normally we are not people who take forever to eat and understood that breakfast ended shortly. We acknowledged it but it seemed they were trying to discourage us from eating so they wouldn't have to deal with last minute diners. I guess that should have been the first clue that we might run into issues. We were shown a table and quickly went to the buffet area to pick out our food. Since we knew it would be cleared out soon, we made sure to get what we needed so we wouldn't be holding them back from cleaning all the food out. After we were seated, someone came to let us know that the buffet would be cleaned out soon-we thanked them for the reminder and said we had all that we needed. About 15 minutes later someone came again and let us know that it would soon be lunch and they needed to change out the dining area. Confusion. Apparently they needed us to move so they could get the place settings changed out for lunch. I'm not sure why it would have been a problem to allow us to sit in the same table, considering we were eating food and new lunch diners would also be eating food. Would us eating breakfast items really be an issue? Apparently it was and they told us they needed to move us to the bar area??? So, they picked up our dishes and whatever else on trays and took us to a window area by the bar. Really? I fail to see how this was a better option. Now, we were the only ones eating food while other people at the next table were having a meeting over drinks. The arrangement seemed to make no sense to me but of course I could be missing some cultural issues or procedure issues-whatever the issue it was bizarre and a bit disruptive. Now we needed new silverware and cups for our water since those were quickly whisked away as soon as they moved us. Of course, now that we were in the bar area-it was harded to notice us and when we needed a water refill, there was no one to ask so we just went out to the lounge area and grabbed some bottle water. Last time we stayed here, I distinctly remember staying after breakfast was over while we lingered and enjoyed the view, never once being asked to move to another area for fear of the lunch diners. It made for a bit of sore point for us that for the next breakfasts we were paranoid that we were taking too long so we ate super fast and whenever someone approached our table, we were convinced it was to tell us to move. Sure, we could have ate outside the restaurant some will say. However, we had a mixed group, including a younger child and being all jetlag, it was just easier to stay in the hotel for the first meal of the day.The rest of the staff at check-in were great and the area is easier to get around to and fro. However, this being Japan, there are many other options for lodging and no need to stick to one place if you don't love it. Overall, this definitely made it clear for us that we do not feel the need to stay here again the next time in Tokyo.",Florida,"twinklehead</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Florida</strong>",127,3.0

A young lady offered us a seat at a long, wooden table and coffee next to the reception, a dark and cold area without any windows they call ""Andaz Lounge"", and proceeded to explain everything in Japanese. I usually can manage standard routines, but when I started to get ""lost"" and looked at my (Japanese) wife, the lady continued in Japanese and let my wife do the translation... She then offered my wife a small wooden box (Omedeto for your upcoming Birthday, would have been nicer to deliver it to her two days later in the room) and took us down to our room. It did have a great view of Tokyo Tower and beyond, a very nice round bath-tub and large shower next to it, but hardly any space to unpack your clothes unless you could hang them, and not much space around the bed. After unpacking, we went back to ""Lounge"" which supposedly offers drinks and snacks at Cocktail hours.

Unfortunately, this was cold like a fridge and windy, so we went for a drink at the ""Tavern"", which they closed shortly.

The location is ok, about a 10 minute walk to the closest subway station, Toranomon station on the Ginza Line. However, if you are looking for busy night life and shopping right at your footsteps, this is not the hotel for you. Another bonus is there is a Limousine Bus that runs straight to the hotel from the 2 airports, Narita and Haneda. It is much more convenient than to take the train from the airport, because you do not have to change into a tax from the train station. The bus is highly recommended. On the facilities, it is commensurate with a 5 star hotel. I did not get a chance to use the swimming pool. The room size is big for Tokyo standards. Another nice touch is the complimentary wine and hors d'oeuvres they offer in the evening hours between 6- 8 pm. The food is surprisingly tasty and with a view of the Tokyo skyline and piano music in the background ( played in the lounge next door), the complimentary experience is really relaxing. I think the Andaz offers great value.","Toronto, Canada","Renae2006</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",53,5.0

The Andaz brand is more individualistic, meaning you do not expect a traditional hotel in terms of design and functionality. The location is more adhered to businesses instead of leisure, and there is a 10 to 15 minute walk to the nearest subway station. The views aren't bad, while mine wasn't facing the Tokyo Tower which costs a little more. Every room has a free mini-bar for non-alcoholic drinks and snacks. I am not a fan of its bathroom which to me is a little too enclosed and completely lack of views. The décor however is nice and should be quite appealing to young urban professionals looking for something more new and edgy.The Andaz style check-in/check-out process is a deliberate casual yet interactional experience. If you are looking for old fashioned service, this may not be your cup of tea. You will find yourself sitting with all kinds of people wanting different things and engaging in different conversations in the same living room. The daily cocktail hour also resides at the same place. For people who want to see and be seen, and for those who can't stand to be alone, it's perfect. For me, I find it a little bit too noisy and disorienting. It probably has something to do with certain flashy and pretentious guests that I encountered with during my stay, not the fault of the hotel at all. But again, you get an idea of what this property speaks to, in terms of audience. It's instagram-worthy.I wouldn't mind going back to Andaz for a beautifully managed and designed property, but in a city filled with competitive options, it certainly won't be my first choice.",,471shopaholic,36,4.0

However, the service can be needlessly awkward (as May from New Orleans well described previously) and sometimes can even verge on being abusive. I both thoroughly enjoyed the Andaz and sometimes resented it.Here's the positive...ACCOMODATIONS: The rooms feature the Japanese aesthetic yet are comfortable, warm, quiet and inviting. The dressing room / bathroom area is made from marble and have very nice fixtures and finishes. I am also impressed that I never heard anybody in the surrounding rooms - the construction seems quite good.CUISINE: The restaurant puts out consistently good food that's well seasoned, well prepared, and well presented. The chef changed the menu regularly - we enjoyed the variety. The wine menu is varied and has depth. The desserts are well crafted and creative. In fact, the Andaz's bakery on the first floor has some excellent desserts we took back to our room and enjoyed while looking at the fantastic view with a glass of wine. Very nice! I am also not much of a breakfast person but thoroughly enjoyed the variety and quality of their daily breakfast buffet. Buffets are almost universally awful, but this one is really nice. Compliments to the chef!AMMENTITIES: I must applaud the hotel for eliminating those annoying and petty charges that seem to plague some hotels. WiFi is fast and free. The gym and pool are very nice and free. They offer a variety of convenient and free snacks / drinks in the room and in the main lobby (on 51). This 'generosity' is quite impressive.PERSONNEL: Everybody is very pleasant, very polite and speak English fairly well. I noted that many guests were from other countries (Poland, India, Germany, Mexico, etc.) and all of them seemed content with the service they received in English. The bell staff on the first floor is really helpful. They promptly greet you, are quick to handle luggage, and gladly assist with getting in/out of your car. And, now the negative...The hotel suffers service problems: (1) Staff seems to love ordering guests around, and (2) they'd rather apologize than fix a problem.Check-in was bureaucratic and time consuming even though I was the only person checking in. The goofy ""Apple Store"" setup (as explained by a previous guest) for the reception desk makes it overly complicated. While they took far to long to check me in, they repeatedly insisted that I sit down and 'relax' as if I was too stupid to know what what posture is comfortable for me.Tip #1 to Andaz: Check in does not need to be a drawn out process - just swipe my card and give me a key. The restaurant service at the Tavern (the main restaurant) was at times stunningly awkward and at times excellent. The tendency to never return with the tea, coffee, water, etc. was annoying. Other times they'd return to top off the beverage just a minute after they had last done it. It was if nobody quite knew who was supposed to follow through on that simple task. Tip #2 to Andaz: Pouring beverages should not need management coordination.They also had big problems solving simple snafus. I came to the restaurant with the hotel's reservation confirmation, yet the restaurant didn't know about it. They apologized. I was left standing there. After several minutes I had to ask what was happening. They apologized that they didn't have our reservation. I was left standing there. I asked to know their suggested solution. They looked shocked that I expected them to solve their mistake. After a flurry of telephone calls they suggested a table at the nearly empty bar next door. That was fine with us, and they said they'd immediately prepare our table. After waiting nearly 20 minutes, and now quite perturbed, I asked the status. The new clerk informed me that they didn't have our reservation and apologized. I asked about the table in the nearly empty bar. She was clueless and made another of flurry of telephone calls after which she said she'd check on the status of our table. She hurried off. About a minute later I followed to find her trying to set the table. I got more apologies. Tip #3 to Andaz: Apologies are a poor substitute for solutions and follow-through.The useless attendants that guard the entrance are officious and ignorant. I've never met such rude Japanese people. I assume they are nice human beings by nature, so evidently the Andaz management team thought it wise to bully guests.Tip #4 to Andaz: Your staff should helpful and polite, always. Even the useless ones directing the non-existing car traffic should assist not bully.","Chicago, Illinois","WorldTravelDB</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",34,4.0

We stayed for 3 nights, checked out and went to the Aman Hotel across town and then returned for 2 nights given how much we enjoyed it.The Good:- Luxurious and stylish hotel modelled on Aman....at half the price (We stayed in both hotels and thought the Andaz was better)- Everything feels new and not worn out- Great views over Tokyo from all rooms (47-49 floors). Best view is the Tokyo Tower view.- Rooftop bar with sunset views and music vibes. My wife said the cocktails were also excellent- Huge heated pool with spa and soaking tub. A favourite with my son every day- The rooms are relatively large compared to other Tokyo luxury hotels- The coffee downstairs at ""Koffee Toranmo"" is the best coffee we've had anywhere in the world- Staff service was excellent and attentive- Location & Area: Some reviews suggest the location isn't good, however given it's 2mins walk to Ginza line metro and 10min taxi to most areas/restaurants/stations you want to visit we thought it was convenient. The only downside is the hotel is located in an office building and during the week full of workers. However the upside is there are restaurants in the building/convenience store/coffee/taxis/bars close by. I wouldn't worry about this factorThe Bad:- The only major issue of our 5 day stay was on the last day when the rooftop bar was booked out for a wedding. This really annoyed my wife who loved going up there for a drink to escape the Tokyo craziness. We are paying good money to utilise the entire hotel and don't appreciate being told that we can't access it for guests who aren't even staying in the hotel?. The hotel should either have a separate facility for weddings/events or notify users on website before booking. If we had known, we probably would have stayed else where.

They served you refreshments while they take your passport complete all the check in process for you. It's nice.The design of the hotel is just something else tho. Beautiful, modern, interesting. The entrance to the main elevator, beautiful. The bathroom, walk in closet area, wood paneling, one piece hard wood long table, beautiful. Everywhere you look it's just eye candy.

As far as the 'hard' product is concerned, compared to the Conrad Tokyo or Park Hyatt Tokyo, the Andaz is comfortably ahead. And that is to be expected as Andaz is the newest hotel opened in 2014, compared to Conrad or Park Hyatt. I think they are 10 to 20 years old respectively?For the 'soft' product though Andaz is still lagging compared to those 2 hotels. Don't get me wrong, the staffs are professional and very pleasant. The staffs at the spa are excellent even by 'Japanese' high end hospitality standard.

All I can remember is the excellent service I got from Andaz Tokyo on every single stay. This time, I booked Andaz with AMEX fine hotel program.The program comes with 100 USD dining credit and breakfast. Rooms was upgraded to the Tokyo tower view room with great skyline view.Visited Tokyo with my wife this time and her birthday was on the day before check-in. The front desk lady noticed that when we handed in our passports to her for check in (in fact, we haven't mentioned anything about my wife's birthday). After a short while. The front desk lady brought us the room keys and handed my wife a nice wooden box of brownie. We were so surprised how diligent the front desk lady was to spot this little thing.Tokyo is never a strange place to Hong Kong people, However, the Tokyo tower view from the room is always stunning. We just want to stay inside the room whole day.In terms of location, it's close to metro station. A few stops from Ginza, but a bit far away from Shinjuku, The hotel restaurant was great, we had nice breakfast there, especially the Japanese breakfast. We used the credits for room service.

I had been expecting a positive experience based on the reviews, but this stay was far and beyond that. Lets discuss a few areas:1) Service: The service here was way over the top. I came in a day early to drop off my luggage at the hotel. I brought along Kosher food that required refrigeration. The staff took my bags and found room for everything in a number of refrigerators and freezers. They were eager to help me get things in order even though I was not staying at the hotel that night. When I checked in early the next morning, they were eager to get me into my room as quickly as possible. The front desk staff was apologetic that the room was not available for only 15 minutes. I remind you that this was way before the hotel check in time. Yet, I was in a gorgeous room by 10 AM! Throughout my stay, every encounter I had with the staff was friendly, helpful and with a smile. Being that I had brought my food, I required some help with the logistics of having it heated up. The hotel was happy to accommodate my needs and make it feel quite normal.2) The room: Wood all around, amazing views of Tokyo. Great bed. One particular thing I liked was the very separate bathroom and shower / bath area. While I was booked into a regular room, it felt as if it were a suite based on the design. Included mini bar, large sofa...3) Spa, gym, and pool: Again, top notch here as well. The spa was clean and had a nice and hot dry sauna. The only thing missing here was a wet sauna. That would have made this perfect. The pool was clean. Perfect temp, great for a morning swim! Gym had all of the standard hotel gym equip with a full set of dumbbells. The view from the spa area is nice, although not as good as the room IMO.4) Location: I have heard people complain about the location. Sure, its not in the middle of everything. A walk to the subway for me was about 7 minutes (Ginza line). It was not great, but not a big inconvenience. One nice thing about the location was it's proximity to the imperial palace. I was able to go on a nice run around the palace walls without having to take a train there.I can't wait to come and visit this phenomenal hotel in the future.","Brooklyn, New York","SholomBrody</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",4,5.0

The breakfast was very decent even though quite expensive. The minus: we went to the bar at the 52nd floor for cocktails. The cocktails were very good (Tokyo mule) but there is a lack of ambiance.

We were running late for our flight so we asked the person in charge at the transportation desk at the hotel entrance to get a taxi, we were waiting for 20 minutes and noticed that there was still no taxi. Then when we went to the person to follow up on our ride to the airport, it was then that we realized that he hasn't even called yet!

It has everything one could need . Id like to say it all depends on what you are looking for..... whether it be for business or pleasure. My trip was strictly for relaxation and not work. My husband asked me what i thought of the hotel upon my return and the best way to describe it was : it was very masculine.... think dark colors, muted lighting, strong harsh colors in the rooms, dark bathtub area , room had a masculine smell with lots of black and gray. So for female travelers out there looking for a warm St Regis type of place, light colors, inviting lighting , lots of beiges and vanilla tones, this is not the place. Its your typical high rise Tokyo style hotel with lots of steel and glass. I did use all of the facilities to include they gym (great views of the city), the sauna (wet ) area was quite good, female locker room area had all one could need, toiletries, towels, snacks, shampoo, hair dryer, creams etc etc.... at no extra charge! The female area also had a private onsen about 2 feet deep with very warm water. There is also a main pool for lap swimming which was also nice. The one thing that this hotel did absolutely get right was a separate elevator that will take you from your room straight to the gym/spa without having to go through the lobby in your bathrobe or work out gear.... upon return from the spa you take the same elevator straight back to your room! never having to worry about uncomfortable encounters... I did peek at the rooftop 52nd floor bar area but wasn't overly impressed and decided the 51st floor Tavern area with piano was much more relaxing. Overall nice stay . There are just so many hotels in Tokyo to try that i will not be staying at this hotel again .

It's still offers you the view and the swimming pool area is beautiful (although not as amazing as Park Hyatt) and is at 200$ cheaper per night- around the hotel has little shops and back alley streets to explore- the hotel itself is on the top of the building and the below floors are full of dining options, plus hair salon, pastry shop etc- we requested inter-connecting rooms as we had our two little children sleeping in the other room- quite spacious compared to the standard hotel room size plus bathrooms are quite large-provided 6-8pm free canapés in the lobby-obviously free wifi-breakfast buffet was good.

It was disappointing - check in process was ok but we had to wait for our room to be ready. We waited for 2 hours. That wasn't really great as I have two little children and both were tired. This waiting around business in a huge hotel - I just don't get. There are definitely other rooms available, it's just a matter of whether you provide it or not.-Dining at the main restaurant was ok. Expensive-The lady in charge on that morning when we wanted to have our breakfast wasnt professional. I had called earlier to reserve a table next to the windows for the view but also to have ample space for our kids to move around. When I told her we had booked a table in that corner she was a bit funny and weird about it. Then when asked to have a high chair, she reacted in a strange way too- The worst was when we were waiting for our express bus to go to Narita airport! 5 men were trying to sort our suitcases and load them on the bus. All confused and taking so long. Took us 20 mins just for us to get on the bus. It was bizarre. Every other stop the bus stopped, it took literally 5 mins. Not even. The man in charge of the drop off and pick up area of the hotel needs extra training. He wasn't polite either. Only man who was very polite and aware of how long it was taking was the French staff member. He was lovely.  Overall we enjoyed it but will I stay again, not sure. U are spoiled for choice in Tokyo.

I stay at Hyatt hotels over 60 nights a year and have Globalist status. It is a very expensive hotel and looked very beautiful from the pictures.I had emailed the hotel prior to arrival to ask if they could make this trip special, but I was informed that they would only adhere to only what was required but nothing more in the WOH program in regards to their Globalist guests. At check-in the lady was friendly, however she was quick to point out that breakfast was only included for 2 adults in the room and since my mother was an adult and not a child she would have to pay for breakfast. Recently Hyatt Gold Passport changed to World of Hyatt, in the old program breakfast was for all registered guests in the room, but now under WOH it is for 2 adults and 2 children per room. Every Hyatt I have stayed at has honored the old terms and invited all 3 of us to breakfast. However this was not the case at the Andaz Tokyo. FYI: At both the Conrad and Hyatt Regency all 3 of us were invited to breakfast and evening canapes in their lounges. (Even though they were not required to do so)The Andaz did adhere to the rules of World of Hyatt. They did NOT go above and beyond in any manner, which is a shame because we were really looking forward to our stay here. I would recommend the GREAT Hyatt Regency a few miles away in Shinjuku or the Conrad nearby if you really want a special stay. I never would have thought that I would be saying that, but it was indeed a much better experience there than I had at the Andaz. We were treated much better at the Conrad and Hyatt Regency than at the Andaz. I must say that the Andaz is a beautiful hotel, however I didn't feel comfortable at all here. The staff was generally nice, but also very standoffish.We also had a few problems with the shower and bathtub in the room which just added to the ""not so great"" experience.

I will also include photos from my previous stays.This hotel is the most gorgeous city hotel I've stayed in, everything from the public areas to the rooms to the pool are meticulously designed and the view is second to none. Toranomon Hills is the building that houses the hotel, and it has a few eateries within the same complex, including a convenience store and a coffee shop serving amazing coffee - Toranomon Koffee. The vicinity is pretty dead on the weekends but there are no shortage of Japanese restaurants, including chains, offering quick bites (noodles).The service across the board is generally very good, and up to Japanese standards. Special shout out goes to Andrea at the front office who has helped me arrange lots of things and made a few exceptions for me. Kaho at the front office is also very friendly, helpful and genuine, while Abe san at the Andaz lounge makes great cocktails. They are all great assets of the hotel. By the way, I noticed all staff members were very helpful and are willing to go beyond their assigned tasks. For example, the wait staff are the Tavern were very helpful with attraction tips and transportation information, they would patiently spend up to 10 minutes in helping us with recommendations, big thumbs up!The breakfast spread, while not huge, is extremely high quality and tasty, especially the Nutella brioche with vanilla sauce - heavenly. The smoked salmon was also among the best I've tasted, but I am very disappointed with the lack of freshly squeezed juice - unacceptable for a hotel of this caliber. I thought it was a bit absurd and borderline disrespectful to drive me out of the restaurant after breakfast has ended, without allowing me to relax and go through my emails for a bit longer. They did, to their credit, offer me a table at the adjacent bar but I thought it was a bit of a hassle to move.All in all, despite this hotel being generally very pricey, this is one of my favorite hotels in the world, and I would not hesitant a single bit to return to this hotel when I'm visiting Tokyo.","Montreal, Canada","mobarnone</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",23,5.0

It all started at check-in, where an error in my booking details (the first night of my reservation was made separately and only reflected one guest instead of two) resulted in the check-in attendant informing me that I would only be given one included breakfast instead of two as the hotel could not alter the reservation file (an explanation that was somewhat mystifying). A later phone conversation with a manager revealed this to be an issue with the accommodation tax, which I was more than happy to pay in order for the issue to be corrected. Nevertheless, at a hotel of this caliber this issue should have been rectified without ever reaching my attention, much less requiring my own intervention with higher-level staff. While the man who did finally rectify the situation was apologetic, precious little was done to try and make up for this service failure beyond being thanked for the 'feedback' I had provided to the staff.This soured my arrival to the hotel and left me feeling as though I was a second-class guest (a perception I suspect relates to the portion of my stay that was on points), as the introduction to the room felt very perfunctory and even a touch condescending, as if I didn't belong in the hotel (my partner later told me that he was asked on multiple occasions whether he was staying in the same room as me, which is more baffling than offensive). I was not informed of the features/services of the hotel—I only discovered the details of the evening wine reception from the small writing on the back of the room key holder—and didn't feel as though the staff cared all that much about me having a memorable experience. Much of the staff around the hotel seemed similarly disinterested/preoccupied, as greetings felt mostly forced and warmth was mostly lacking. When I went to the Rooftop Bar one evening, I was brusquely asked if I had a reservation (the bar was mostly empty) before being shown to a seat after responding that I was a guest of the hotel. That said, encounters with staff at BeBu and the Andaz Lounge, as well as with the housekeeping staff were positive, which kept my stay from being a complete service disaster.The room itself was nice and spacious by Tokyo standards, although perhaps a touch on the austere side to be considered truly luxurious. While it contained all the modern conveniences you would need—the complimentary non-alcoholic minibar and snacks are a nice touch—the room did show signs of wear (marks on the walls, et al.) and was furnished in a relatively spartan style for a so-called luxury hotel (bedroom furnishings consisted of a bed, two night tables, a desk and two chairs). The bed was also quite firm (although this seems to be more of a Japanese thing) but the linens were comfortable and adequate for a hotel of this class. I was also apparently 'upgraded' to a room with a view of the Imperial Palace, which was nice but didn't feel like all that much of an upgrade when compared with the vistas of Tokyo Bay and Tokyo Tower from the other sides of the hotel.The hotel's food and beverage venues were also somewhat disappointing, ranging from an acceptable meal at BeBu to a disappointing breakfast at Andaz Tavern. Having read reviews of the oft-vaunted breakfast, I was disappointed to find that it was distinctly average: the food was mostly lukewarm and not in any way exceptional, and I was served a cafe latte at an undrinkable temperature that somewhat managed to mask the poor quality and presentation. (Save your money and get your food and coffee fix from Toranomon Koffee in the same building, which is of superlative quality and features outstanding service.) Drinks at the Rooftop Bar were of decent quality, but were not at the level one would expect in such a venue (and at such a price point!). The best food experience I had at the hotel came courtesy of the hotel's pastry shop, which produces nice cakes at a seemingly justifiable price point.In the end, I left the hotel not only disappointed, but feeling unable to express this disappointment (I already had to ask to correct an error on the folio presented to me at check-out, the proverbial cherry on top of the service gaffes), as the staff seemed to consistently have little interest in my experience as a guest. Having arrived expecting a hotel that would make my stay in Tokyo the memory of a lifetime, I left feeling grateful that the magnificent city of Tokyo would outshine my memories of this hotel.","Melbourne, Australia","Will C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",6,2.0

Coming in by train, we rode into Shimbashi station, which was a very far walk with our luggage. We had shipped in our luggage from previous hotel and they had it ready and waiting in the room. The hotel in Toronamon Hills tower, requires you go up to their lobby floor, then transfer elevator bank to room floor. Unfortunately, we arrived late, and found that we also had to walk very far to find food since most of the restaurants in the tower closed at 11PM. The closest late-night food is at Shimbashi station, which is where Japanese businessmen & women from Ginza swarm bars and izakaya which is not relaxing at a all. Room service was a limited bar menu from their in-house restaurant. It was also very hard to find a convenience store/pharmacy after hours. The only other option is taking a taxi. The room was gorgeous and spacious, with a full wall window overlooking Tokyo Tower. The separate bathroom/closet area was huge with luxe brown wood finishing and a gorgeous large round tub & rain shower head. There is a beautiful raw-edge wood desk facing the window and the Andaz team provided us an extra bed that didn't disturb the room at all. We made a reservation for two days in theSushi restaurant where we had an omakase-style sushi dinner that was awesome, very filling and some of the best fish we've ever had. We also had a round of drinks upstairs in the rooftop bar which was chilly but the staff provides heated blankets as you overlook the city. They had a really good DJ, excellent drinks, and accommodated our requests to transfer seats for a better view. The front desk staff also made arrangements for our taxi to the airport. Overall, a gorgeous hotel with staff intended to do everything they can to make the customer happy and really beautiful amenities.

From the service to the room, everything was fantastic. As soon as you enter, you are greeted warmly by reception. A nice touch is that they have delicious traditional rice crackers available at reception when you check-in. Across from reception is the small, open lounge like area. Here, there are small snacks and juices available to eat. It was nice snacking on something here after a long day. As for the aesthetic of the hotel, I thought it was beautiful, minimalist, and modern. It made the hotel feel very upscale and created a quiet atmosphere. I personally didn't really enjoy how minimalist it was because it felt a bit cold to me, but that's just personal preference. However, the room was exactly to my taste. As soon as I entered, there was a giant window that boasted a wonderful view of Tokyo. What a treat to view the sparkling lights of skyscrapers before bed and wake up to a beautiful blue sky. Additionally, the free snacks and drinks were all delicious and high-quality! My favorite part of the Andaz was the breakfast option. The breakfast was a fantastic mixture of Eastern and Western dishes. I really enjoyed having the option of eating a delicious Japanese breakfast each day.

I wouldn't say Andaz took the high to a new level, but it certainly put additional twists on it (in good ways). There were interesting touches throughout to surprise in unexpected ways! The twin room was of decent size and more than pleasant enough. My son and I enjoyed the pool very much. I found the gym to be superbly equipped and operated. Views of Tokyo, especially from the rooftop bar, were simply breathtaking.If I were to nitpick, the only possible downside to this Andaz is the location.

On our most recent trip in March, we experimented with a luxury hotel trifecta: started with two nights at the Aman, spent a few days at the Andaz using Hyatt points, and finished at the Park Hyatt Tokyo. Let's start with the positives at the Andaz: we stayed in a room on the 50th floor, and the view was absolutely sensational. It's especially incredible in the evening, when all of the surrounding buildings are aglow. In many ways the Andaz offers better views than the premium rooms at the PH; on a clear day, we could glimpse Fuji *and* the dramatic cityscape (whereas at the PH, you're often choosing between Fuji views or views of Yoyogi/Shinjuku). Moving around the city was a cinch thanks to the hotel's proximity to the subway stations at Kamiyacho (gotta love that Hibiya line) and Toranomon. The surrounding area has fairly diverse and reasonably priced dining options, from an old-school soba joint to cheap curry rice to coffee places with surly hipster baristas- though you have to go outside the nabe to find Tokyo's exceptional restaurants. Staff are generally warm and attentive, holding elevator doors if they see you coming and offering tins of candy upon check-out. The OK: We had a few requests of the ""host"" staff while we were there, ranging from dinner and cocktail reservations to a gift. They did a terrific job of speedily arranging ""White Day"" flowers and chocolates for us, and the staff member who checked us in kindly offered to take a photo of us to celebrate (a nice and unexpected touch). They were less adept and efficient when it came to food recs and reservations- we wound up handling most of those arrangements ourselves. Now the not-so-good: I arrived under the impression that the hotel would be well-designed. While the hotel common spaces are comfortable and chic, the guest rooms are unspeakably ugly. Because we were using points, we had a standard king room, and it felt cramped. The beautiful views are marred by clunky, awkwardly placed furniture; the bathroom layout is odd; and let's not even talk about that abomination of a chartreuse rug. I was also surprised to see that while the hotel is fairly new, our room looked a bit worse for the wear; lots of scuff marks and dents in the white walls and faint stains on the carpet. The hotel buffet breakfast is expensive and full of insufferable American businessmen in suits who talk on their cellphones at the tables and strut around self-importantly. Skip it and go eat at one of the local cafes.We'd definitely use points again at the Andaz; not sure if we'd actually shell out $$$ for a room there. Perhaps the higher room categories offer more space and better design.","Long Island City, New York","ValeP36</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Island City, New York</strong>",21,4.0

Will definitely return. Absolute modern luxury with great services and staff. Hotel is located in Toranomon Hills which is the base for the 2020 olympics so the area will only improve. Not much going on right at the hotel (Mori Tower) which is actually pleasant in Tokyo, when the rest of the day is spent battling crowds and wishing you brought your own face mask too! The tower is about 5-8min from Toranomon station on Ginza line (need pasmo or suica) and 10-14min from Shimbashi station on JR yamanote line (free with JR pass). Close to imperial palace and ginza too. The area isnt all that crowded compared to shinjuku or shibuya and shimbashi itself was a fun area (seems like where the salary men go to play)Once you enter the tower everything is serene and its easy to get to the hotel lobby on 51st floor (takes only 44sec)The lobby is amazing and the checkin experience sets the tone for the whole stay- super friendly and done over wine and snacks, before going down another set of elevators to your room. Andaz didn't honour the room upgrade that comes with tablet membership but it didn't matter because the baseroom was simply stunning. So modern, large, well appointed- and made more so with sleek floor to ceiling windows and auto blinds, and complimentary minibar (non alcoholic) and snacks. There is a different feel to the hotel room when you can open the fridge and grab a drink and snack without having to spend 20bucks for it at checkout. Wonderful day and night view of Tokyo tower and the sprawling city. The room layout is perfect and the washroom is the best I've ever used. Most sophisticated Toto i saw in all of japan. A large step in stone/tiled room with multi head shower, and a deep large onsen-like tub which is just wonderful. This respect for water is present throughout the entire hotel especially the pool and gym area. The pool area is so modern with amazing staff. The pool is tight once two people swim laps but never was crowded so this wasn't an issue. The hot tubs are plenty with options of jets, full body aqua massage and carbonated hot tub. It was wonderful to unwind here daily. The changerooms to the pool are amazing themselves. Tons of space, lockers, lounge space with recliner chairs and snacks, and the mens room had a 18deg plunge pool, 42deg hot tub and great sauna. Womens had a 360 shower experience which i was told was amazing and the spa services world class. Breakfast was another major highlight. So many amazing food options, japanese and western style. Attention to detail everywhere- the food, the service, the lounge. Just amazing. And more free snacks and wines everyday at 6pm. I don't know how a hotel could be any better. There is a to-go coffee area where you can make a great coffee as you head out. We are glad we stayed here for five nights and the PH for 1 to check it out but would have wanted to spend all our time here!This is our go to choice for Tokyo. Best hotel. Brief tips for japan:- pocket wifi is a life saver for google maps alone- Pasmo card is useful and worked for subway, cabs in tokyo and kyoto- keep a small towel as some washrooms dont have towels or dryers. - have a good system to handle and make use of all the change you accumulate","Vancouver, Canada","Sam B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",78,5.0

Really makes you feel like home! and speak fluent English as well. One suggestion. Most travelers really need the concierge to offer receiving package service. i.e. I was planing to order a SIM card online and ship to the hotel before I arrive so that I can have access to the map online in Japan(we all know how complicated the subway stations are). Unfortunately, this property concierge never replies my emails. At last, I have to send my SIM card to the convenient store nearby this hotel. In contrast, during this business trip, I also stay in hilton nagoya for one night, they respond my receiving package request within one day. A nice concierge service can really bring your property to next level. I still remember the warn greeting from park hyatt Tokyo last year. Overall, this is a very nice property of Hyatt.

On this trip I used Chase/Hyatt points to stay at the three Hyatt locations in Tokyo: Hyatt Regency Tokyo, Tokyo Park Hyatt, and the Andaz Toranomon Hyatt.Transportation:On this most recent stay I actually used the Airport Limousine (shuttle bus) service from Narita Airport to the Hyatt Regency in Shinjuku. However, the service also takes you directly from Narita (3100 yen/approx $31 US) or Haneda (1130 yen/approx $11 US) to the Andaz. Since the last portion of our trip was at the Andaz, we booked the shuttle in the opposite direction to Narita at the bell counter on the first floor. It's very convenient as they will book the charges directly to your room. You then settle the charges on your credit card when you check out. You can also use alternate means of transportation such as the train, but on recent trips, I decided that the airport limousine (shuttle bus) is easier since you don't have to worry about lugging around heavy luggage through train stations.A quick note on the Airport Limousine service - I normally find that it takes 1 hour and 40 minutes or so from Narita Airport into Tokyo. On this most recent trip there was a traffic accident, so our ride into Tokyo was over 2 hours long. Location:Of the three hotels we stayed at on this trip, I felt that the Andaz equally as convenient as the Hyatt Regency. The Hyatt Regency was nice because the underground walkway to the subway and a 24 hour 7-11 was connected to the hotel. The Andaz on the other hand was a 5 to 10 minute walk from the Toranomon Station on the Tokyo Metro's Ginza Line. Additionally, since the Andaz is located on the top of an office building, there are numerous restaurants and a convenience store located inside of the hotel. We found this to be tremendously useful on the first night of our check in. On that first night, the weather turned ominous with high winds and rain. Rather than chance it out on the streets, we were able to have a delicious meal without stepping out in the elements. When we were done with dinner, we were able to stop at the convenience store and head back to our room, all without leaving the safety and dryness of the building.Hotel:Finding the entrance to the hotel can be a little bit tricky. If you enter the building from the 2nd floor, you'll need to eventually make your way down to the 1st floor to the Andaz elevators. You'll need to catch the express elevator up to the 51st floor and when you exit, you'll eventually come across the area where the reception desk is. The staff was tremendously warm and welcoming. One staff member rushed over to grab our suitcases and offered us a seat in the guest lounge. As we checked in (still seated) we were offered refreshments, so we opted for tea. Once checked in, the reception staff asked to show us our room. At that point we were led from the 51st floor to our room on the 49th floor. The staff then did a quick run through of the complimentary items in the room as well as some of the key features. This was all very nice.As for the room, it was large, modern in design, and upon first impression appeared to be a better value than the Park Hyatt. Here we have a Category 6 Andaz vs a Category 7 Park Hyatt - which on first impression as I mentioned - looked far more elegant and provided a more open feel. The large floor to ceiling glass windows behind a wall to wall couch was an extremely nice touch. The flow of the bathroom to closet was well thought out and allowed you to segregate the area via a hidden door. Alternatively, you could leave the door open for that open feeling. The bath area was exceptional. The shower stall was in the same glass enclosed room as the tub which meant that you could take a shower, and step into the tub without walking out into the cold air. So why did I say that this seemed like a better value on first impression? Well, there were a few things about the room that detracted from the overall experience. First, I had an issue with the smell emanating from the toilet. Just like the Park Hyatt, the toilet is enclosed in its own little stall that can closed off from the rest of the bathroom. The toilet itself had a funky/sour/spoiled smell to it. I've smelled this before from time to time in the restrooms here at work. It's almost as if the cleaners used old cleaner, or recycled cleaner from numerous other cleanings. Whatever the case, the smell made me feel as though the bathroom as dirty. I didn't feel like I was in my own private bathroom, rather I felt as though I was in a public restroom. It's amazing really, how smell could make a room that looks immaculate in appearance ""feel"" dirty. Second, while extremely modern and flashy, I found the faucet in the bathroom the most impractical to use as compared to the other two Hyatts on this stay. The knobs were probably the diameter of a half dollar or smaller and were difficult to operate. I prefer traditional sized larger knobs. Third, the Nespresso and the blow dryer in the room were broken. The Nespresso would either push through too much water on one instance. On another we had to keep restarting the process to squeeze out enough water to create the desired amount of coffee. The hair dryer's heating coils would not fire on, so my wife was left with cold air coming out of her hair dryer. We were in a rush, so rather than call in for a new one, my wife stepped out of the room with damp hair. While all three of these are minor quibbles, you really wouldn't expect the bad smell or broken items in a room that costs so much. After all, the Park Hyatt and the Hyatt Regency all smelled great - The Hyatt Regency being significantly cheaper.The Bottom Line:Minor quibbles aside (most could be solved with a quick phone call), I think this was an amazing hotel. The service in my opinion was on par or equally as good with The Park Hyatt. I also feel that the modern design and quality of the rooms will blow most people's minds.","Honolulu, United States","Chad M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, United States</strong>",17,5.0

The rooms are beautifully appointed, well designed and quite large. We stayed in a room overlooking Tokyo Tower and were treated to a view of Mt Fuji on a wonderfully clear winter morning. The lobby floor and the rooftop sushi bar all have fantastic views over the entire city. A couple of additional tips for first time travelers:1) there are multiple ways of getting to the hotel from Narita, all of them over an hour. We deemed a car/taxi as too expensive and caught a limousine bus in which worked great for luggage. We took the N'Ex (Narita Express) back to the airport and, while comfortable, it was a bit of a slog with stairs and escalators and not-quite-clear directions. Both were fine, but leave 90 mins for the travel experience. 2) On the transport front the hotel, although pretty well located, does not seem particularly well known to taxi drivers, so the small translation given to is by the concierge was most appreciated 3) We had a decidedly mixed experience with food. Breakfast can be ok although coffee is a little bitter for my palate and lattes way too milky. If you decide to go a la carte be warned that a cup of tea will cost you 1,100 Yen which borders on outrageous. Dinner was expensive and very ordinary. Suggest you go out!4) there is free coffee and tea available near the lobby (& treats). Which is great, except that it makes the 1,100¥ cup of tea a few feet away extra annoying5) There is a lovely Spa, Gym and swimming pool on a lower floor with a beautiful view of the city6) the staff were very kind and professional I still recommend the Andaz, but now a little wiser having visited it.

Andrea Lobo, the front office manager, was a big part in making our three stays in 2016 very memorable. She made sure we were well taken care of during our stays.Andaz tokyo is the perfect city hotel. It has everything I could possibly need without being opulent or extravagant. The hotels decor and design is maybe my favorite part, inspired in Japanese traditions and paying homage to minimalism. The use of wood throughout the hotel give the minimalism a feel of warmth. You certainly experience a quiet form of luxury at this hotel, I love it!Breakfast is complete and of very high quality. While the options may not be the most extensive in the world or as in other hotels like the Park Hyatt, you get everything you need and the service is also great. I love the location of this hotel; while it is not super central, it is very close to Ginza and other major areas. Also the subway is just four short blocks away and you can get anywhere with that in Tokyo. This is my favorite hotel in Tokyo and also possibly one of my favorite in the world.

I get that the ultramodern design thing is ""hip"" but there is such a thing as taking it too far.I will say though that the room had incredible views, and probably the greatest bath tub of just about any hotel I have ever been in.With better signage, more helpful staff, and friendlier service people in the bar, I could easily see this being a five-star hotel. This price though, I expected better service. ","Phoenix, Arizona","angelaz918</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",78,4.0

Staff is friendly, breakfast is great (though should have a wee bit more choices) and rooms are good.A few issues why it did not get full marks from me:1) Check in time can be lengthy - seems confusing between the reception area and the coffee/drinks area while checking in. Need to improve on that.2) Getting to your room can be challenging especially when you get out on the room floor - the room numbers are ridiculously difficult to read (I find it by remembering whether I am on the shorter or longer ends of the corridor)3) bars lack personality compared to say other hotels like Mandarin, Palace Hotel or even Grand Hyatt!","Hong Kong, China","siewshentan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",8,4.0

After taking the bus to the hotel, we were greeted at the door where we were escorted up to the 51st floor lobby to check in. It's a bit confusing with the three sets of elevators: one to go from the ground floor to the 51st floor lobby, one to go to the spa and the rooms and then one to go up to the 52nd floor for the rooftop bar.The rooms are well-appointed with great views. Like the other Hyatt properties, the bathroom is very nicely put together, although the round tub is a bit odd. It was hard to lay down in the tub to take a bath, but it is a lovely bathroom with the toto washlets that I love.The A&O spa/gym was also very nice, although much smaller than the ones at the Park Hyatt and the Grand Hyatt, which are gems that are among the best for the entire Hyatt chain. The hot tub was dark and small, but I was happy to be able to soak in 42C hot water, unlike some of the other Hyatt properties outside Japan. The gym is quite nice, but my views are skewed as I was just at the Grand Hyatt Singapore, where the gym is the size of a regular gym.The breakfast was one of the highlights of the hotel, with a great mix of western dishes and Japanese breakfast. The hotel is at Toranomon Hills Mori Tower, which did take a few minutes to get to the two closest subway stop. I do prefer the Grand Hyatt and Park Hyatt in Tokyo in that they are both grander experiences; however, the Andaz was really excellent. It was very nice to have the juice and water in our fridge as well as the lobby area to consume throughout our stay.","New York City, New York","awc4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",36,5.0

Yes. Worth it? You bet!This was my 4th stay at the Andaz Tokyo. And once again, it was perfect! I think that this may be the best hotel I've ever stayed in.First, a heartfelt ""great job"" to all the staff. They make the difference between great and perfect. A special ""congratulations"" to Andrea Lobo and her team. No feat is too difficult for them! I was trying to have my flights changed, and could not manage, one of her team members took the matter upon herself, and I got on the flight I wanted. This is a team of people that other luxury hotel concierge / front office staff should learn from. Friendly, caring, polite, ""can-do"" attitude. Bravo! It's because of this team of people that I've already booked my next stay there, and will make the Andaz my home in Tokyo.Now, let me also say that I am a Diamond Hyatt Gold Passport member. This meant that I did get a room upgrade, which was great, free breakfast, and a late checkout, which worked perfectly. But, regardless, the experience there is flawless.Another highlight of the stay is the room. Huge, by Tokyo standards, very well appointed, and with an amazing view from floors 47-50 where the rooms are located. At night we slept with the blinds up, to soak up this amazing view of this great city. One suggestion to the hotel: upgrade the cable TV offerings. Not enough English channels to watch if you decide to stay in at night.One problem with a noise that we encountered when the wind was blowing very hard outside our room was quickly acknowledged, and we got a little ""sorry"" note and an amazing box of cookies as an apology, even though it was not the hotel's fault. That goes back to the service levels I mentioned earlier.One more pointer to the hotel: The bathrobes are great, but anyone at 1,82m height and 120 kilos weight simply won't fit... Why not have a few spare XXL ones somewhere, and sneak them in when a large guest arrives..? ;-)The restaurant is fantastic, and serves a great breakfast buffet (made even better when it's free for Diamond Members!). Another suggestion: don't use butter to saute and fry otherwise vegan dishes, like mushrooms and potatoes. It reduces the choices of vegan guests, or guests who don't eat dairy. The view from the restaurant is also amazing.Another property highlight is the Bar on the 52nd floor. Great cocktails, a great selections of super premium liquor brands, and well priced for the location.The location is great, a 20 minute walk from Ginza, and a short 5 minute walk to the nearest Ginza line metro station.Very highly suggested!","Luxembourg City, Luxembourg","Alvertos R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Luxembourg City, Luxembourg</strong>",320,5.0

This hotel offers excellent hardware and software in short. Stayed in this hotel for two nights only as a shot getaway with Hyatt point + cash and the stay was very memorableHardware:1. Stunning skyline views from lobby and rooms2. Artistic, warm and cozy decor around the hotel3. Extremely spacious room with large deep soaking tub and separate rain shower4. Complimentary snacks and non alcoholic drinks from minibar5. Complimentary evening wine, sake and canapés, selection is limited but quality is very good6. Very good breakfast, with selection of Japanese and western items. Good selection of local fruits and cereal too.7. Tea and coffee at lounge is very convenient to tourists like us returning late at night8. Great skyline view from pool, and we really enjoyed the Jacuzzi and carbonated hot water bath in the pool area, this is one of the best features of this hotel9. Fresh floral arrangements in room making it cozy and warm10. Location is not too central to major shopping areas but it's close to metro station and walking distance to the tokyo tower and palaceSoftware1. Very personalized service, received email from hotel asking me about my arrival time, early checkin was offered at 9am in the morning as we traveled a red eye flight2. Staffs are extremely friendly and attentiveThe only minor downside was the turndown service, you have to request for it and it's not done in a fully proper manner.ConclusionVery good hotel in general, room rate is not low but I believe the quality and service worth every penny you spent.","Hong Kong, China","Michaelcoth</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",139,5.0

The hotel is practically brand new...it is only two-year-old. It is a nice boutique hotel with great design, a mix between traditional and modern. The lobby is on the 51st floor where you are invited to sit, relax and have refreshments while the staff attended to your room registration. The staff will take you to your room and show you around. Since the building is quite high, you have choices of unobstructed view of Tokyo from your room. You can choose the Tokyo Tower view, the rainbow bridge bay view, the Imperial Palace View, or the Shibuya city view etc. Soft drinks in the mini bar are complimentary, but not alcoholic drinks. The swimming pool is indoors and is heated with a jacuzzi next to it. However, I find the jet stream of the jacuzzi to be weak, not like the ones in the Grand Hyatt. The hot spring in the locker room does not have jet stream either. It is more a traditional Japanese hot tub set at 42.5 degrees C. Everything in this hotel has style from the spa to the restaurants. There is a rooftop bar on the 52 floor and I recommend you to visit around 6pm to watch the city lights come on. The Andaz Grill on the 51st floor is a good place for lunch and the menu is fusion. I tried the Hokkaido Paella. Ask for a window seat so you will be treated to photo perfect views. The Toranomon Hills Mall next to the hotel is more an office building with lots of upmarket restaurants and one small supermarket. I think the Andaz is somewhere right between the Grand Hyatt and the Park Hyatt... It is priced higher than the Grand Hyatt but lower than the Park Hyatt. For people with children, the Grand Hyatt is preferable with the Roppongi Hill Mall nearby etc. The Andaz is more for mature adults and is a more reclusive place where every corner is picture perfect.","Hong Kong, China","clubikon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",27,5.0

Walkable distance to Tokyo tower and few beautiful temples. They had a happy hour in the lobby with drinks and light snacks. Lobby also has free soda, juice, coffee and water 24 hours.

I took the opportunity to partake in their fitness facility and spa this time around - which were well managed and provided excellent services. That I actually enjoyed my daily workouts says a lot of how much I liked the ambience. The staff were professional, polite and friendly and their overtures to accommodate our visit was clearly evident. Food at the Tavern (breakfast and dinner) was good but not excellent - a little too eclectic perhaps.

This is the 3rd and definitely last time I tried any of their hotels, because they are definitely not for everyone. From a very rocky start at the reception where they always give you a lot of attitude and because every 'host' part of the staff are meant to be concierge, greeters, bell boys,... None of them are actually specialized in their job. So when you need some help you don't always get the best advice or efficiency. The fact that there is no concierge means you need to always call the reception and they are always busy at the reception and they are not particularly good in terms of recommendations or searching for information. Service depends on the 'host' that you get on the other side of the line. Some of them are outstanding some of the have big attitude problems. A big shout out to Owen, Ayari Kure, Arisa Takeda, Rie Moroi, who were part of the really really helpful personal. The rooms are super weirdly arrange. The rooms even feel smaller and less high than other Tokyo rooms. There are desks and coffe tables almost as big as the bed and beg are placed in front of a sofa that blocks the window, which is a big shame given that the views from the rooms are magnificent.

Very well designed, the pool facities are worth the stay by themselves. We had the junior suite, they provided the kids with bathrobes and goodies. I loved the kimonos and the bathroom. We had a direct view on Mt. Fuji - we were lucky, we had no clouds. As for service, from the concierge desk to the lobby attendance or the restaurants crew, everything was sublime. We asked for restaurant recommandation and it was always good - altought sometime a bit on the pricey side. I stayed at other top hotel in Tokyo ( like the Tokyu or the Conrad) and the staff are cooler and more friendly here. They're is some front-desk attendee that are non-japanese, and it's nice too. They also responded well to my emails. As many stated, breakfast is king here. They also have a sushi restaurant, but you have to reserve as places are limited. We tryed the burgers on the ground floor Tavern - it's ok, but the food court in the office tower offers better alternative for lunch.Great stay really, amenities and staff are top. As for location, I actually found it well located for somebody who wants to explore the city as you are really central.

In the end we decided to split it between 3 hotels to compare our experiences.The Andaz is a completely different hotel from the Park Hyatt Tokyo. If you try and compare the 2 hotels, it's pretty much comparing apples and oranges. They are in different locations and have completely different clientele that it attracts. Having put that out there...the hotel is very nice. You cannot fault the view, decor, or service. Rooms were spacious in comparison to a typical Tokyo hotel. The beds were very comfortable, even a roll away. The restaurant has an amazing breakfast spread and we ate there every morning. We loved the specialized made toiletries they had in the bathroom. The snacks and drinks available in the lobby was a lovely break. We also made use of the umbrellas in the rooms several times. They provided kids toiletries, pj's, robe, and cup for our 6 year old son.The only con I experienced was that it was a holiday week when we were there and the hotel was booked solid. The reception area would be crowded with not enough seats for those who wanted to have a drink and snacks. There were several wedding parties staying there so it was crowded in the reception area. The informal check in area was a little hectic since there is no separate counters, instead there is one large table with several employees checking in/out. Not a dealbreaker at all and it was the only time we really had to wait for anything during our stay.We did walk around the hotel to check out the area and were able to find a few places open to have a ramen meal at, even late at night. So, it is quiet in the area, with businesses closing by 9-10.

Our only point of comparison in Tokyo was the Park Hyatt - which we had stayed at for the commencement of our trip.THE ROOMAs expected, the room was fantastic and spacious. I loved clever joinery / storage + bathroom design. The way everything had a place and fit together really well.The complimentary in room Andaz refreshments were a little limited - but it was quite easy to head downstairs and grab whatever you need from the lounge area.THE HOTEL The service was defiantly more 'relaxed' than the PH, though still always very professional. We did have a bit of an issue at check in where the room rate didn't match the rate on my booking - though this was resolved fairly quickly - to be honest, this was perhaps the only service 'fault' I can recall from our entire trip to Japan (we were blown away). While the rooms / design might have it over the Park Hyatt, I'm not sure that I particularly enjoyed the layout of shared areas. All on level 51 is the main reception, the guest lounge, a number of function spaces and the Andaz Tavern + lounge.I always found the floor to be quite busy and loud (weekend, there seemed to be a number of functions) - which I find is the opposite to what I want after a full on day in the city. THE FOODWe had breakfast one morning at the tavern - it was quite relaxing and we were given a really nice private table by the window.Most of the hot food was on the warm side which was disappointing, but the pastries and fresh fruit + juice were fantastic. Given Tokyo is a 'late to open' city (main shops and attractions open after 10:30am) it is a great way to start + plan your day.Dinner at the Tavern was also good - food was great - be prepared to wait 40+mins for one of the 'clay pots'.The only disappointment I found was that I spoke to staff 2hrs before we wished to dine and asked if it was possible to be seated by the window (it was our last night in Tokyo, and we hadn't managed to get a window seat at a bar or restaurant at night in Tokyo for the entirety of our trip). I was told that all window seats were unavailable - which wasn't that big of a problem - the view from our room was good. The annoying part was that a window table sat empty for the majority of our dinner. BeBu - burgers on the ground floor.We made a dinner of it one night and it was fantastic - the 'Pub Buddy' burger was amazing and the service was super friendly. HYATTThe hotel staff made a real effort to acknowledge my Platinum status - which was quite nice. We ended up in a room with a fantastic view and were offered 2pm checkout without even asking.","Sydney, Australia","AustMat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",37,5.0

The bathtub is very large and accommodating, and the Toto is state of the art. I even had to update my Toto at home after being inspired by the new models. Perhaps even more amazing than the room is the pool area. I did not bother packing a swimsuit for my trip, but after getting a glimpse at the pool, I rented some swimwear from the spa and went for a dip. Between the amazing views from the pool deck, the adorable mini-pools around the corner, and the wonderfully decadent changing rooms, I can say this was the best pool experience I have ever had. The rates are, of course, a bit on the absurd side for anyone who is not a 'job creator' or living on a trust fund. But you can definitely see where your money is going.

I was in Tokyo for 3 days on business. I am a frequent traveler and spend more than 75 nights a year in hotel rooms. I have stayed in a number of hotels in Tokyo over the past few years, but going forward the Andaz is the only place I'll go. The staff greet you warmly and make sure you have everything to your satisfaction. The lobby is on level 51 and the rooms are on the 4 floors below the lobby. Every room has gorgeous sweeping view over Tokyo. The colors are earthy and muted and are a welcome return to a classic palate that hoteliers have largely forgotten about. Lighting is perfectly muted, not too bright, not too dim, just right. Again, too many hotels, especially in Asia, use harsh white fluorescent lighting and the muted warmth provided a relaxing tone the minute you enter your room. The room has plenty of outlets and they are well placed. My biggest pet hate these days is walking into a hotel and spending 10 minutes trying to figure out the electricity. The panel operating the lights and drapes is conveniently placed next to the bed. No need to get up to make adjustments. Bed is super comfy, and the towels and linens rival the Four Seasons.I love that there is no charge for the minibar, Its shocking that more hotels haven't figured out that this keeps customers happy and doesn't cost much. Good free wifi with the room. Bath and shower very nice with decent rainshower. Could do with a touch more water power, but on the 50th floor, it's still pretty amazing. Free wine gathering every evening in the lobby is nice. The rooftop bar on 52nd floor is pretty cool, but I wish it were more open. Location overall is fantastic as its in a quiet part of business district but train is close and even roppongi is walkable in about 30 minutes. I walked it to see. I can't wait to come back.

The entry/bathroom/changing area is almost as big as the room itself, which I found really luxurious.

Loved the huge soaking tub, as well as the most spacious shower I've ever used in a hotel. Soaps/shampoos are unbranded--some people might not care, but would it be too hard to tempt us kleptomaniacs/hoarders with some Aesop?

Classic example is that 4 LED ceiling lights shining above my head while working on the working desk now, a table lamp should have been in place as it is seriously affecting my wife's sleeping when I need to work late.That 4 very bright LED ceiling lights above the bathtub has completely destroy the ambiance within the bath / shower room, I need to stick 4 papers by myself to covering it in order to reduce its brightness.Then that very dazzling long light beam above the bed has constantly made the bedroom area extremely bright while nothing can be done to adjust it at all. Have to ask your engineering to come in at night to unplug that however the ceiling lighting along the room foyer area cannot be switch off independently.Water pressure for both the hand / rainforest shower are kind of weak especially the rainforest shower is only like drizzle, had asked engineering to adjust it but apparently nothing can be done at all. It has taken 15 minutes to fill up the water for your bathtub plus apparently no ventilation system is available within the bath room area.The bathroom's amenities (shower, shampoo, conditioner, lotion) are non branded local stuffs unlike your other Hyatt properties at least using Aesop and fortunately I have brought my own. For your information even the good old Palace Hotel Tokyo is using French bathroom's amenities product now which has lower ADR than your property.The hair blow dryer's power is so weak that I really miss that from your Park Hyatt Tokyo.The humidity of the room is the driest that I have ever stayed in top class hotels in Tokyo, not to mention the Peninsula Hotel which has very nice air-con which is filtering into the room with individual controlled humidity. This is the first time in Tokyo that I need to request for a humidifier in my hotel room but its water tank size is so small that cannot even last for overnight function.Those bath towels being used are the worst quality that I have came across globally, one side is flat and rough and is like a rug. It is so rough and hurting the skin plus not functional when drying your body / hair at all.Your two towel hooks are installed wrongly within the shower room behind the glass door which is not serving its purpose to drying the towel after being used. Plenty of space facing the big mirror to installing that instead.Unfortunately your published room size at 50 sq.m is a false information as it has only 41 sq.m instead unless you are accounting for the public corridor space in front of our room. My wife is an architectural designer as profession so is very hands on plus with our actual measuring of the room. For your information the standard room at the Peninsula Tokyo is having 51 sq.m which is pretty genuine and unlike here.Due to the smaller size of your bedroom portion versus the bathroom, you have no choice but to put the bed facing the window however that long sofa is blocking half its window view already which is pointless despite you have large window. Then the height of the sofa level is too low to matching the working desk level nor is comfortable whatsoever.There is only one small drawer within the whole room to put clothing which is not acceptable.Your so call working desk has no drawer nor any basic stationary being provided especially supposed to be a business travellers' hotel.Almost all your pillows are so soft and not well supporting the neck despite we have more than enough pillows within our room now.While there are actually sufficient space at the bedside but the two bedside panels are too small and lack of sufficient space.Very disappointed hotel ....",,KoY131,68,3.0

I picked it as I had heard that this newer hotel is better than the famous Park Hyatt in Shinjuku in terms of service as well as the room itself. Also the location is fantastic because its central to pretty much all of Tokyo. While Toranomon itself doesn't offer much to do, you can take the train and get to pretty much anywhere in Tokyo in about 20-30 minutes. The Ginza line can take you pretty much wherever you want. I arrived early in the morning and they got me checked in quickly. I noticed that this isn't always the case for other guests as their front desk staff doubles as concierges. So during peak checkin times there maybe a bit of wait. The room itself was fantastic and had great views over Tokyo. I had a friend who works in Osaka join me for a couple of days out of my stay and the Andaz hosts were kind to provide a rollaway bed and amenities so that he can stay with me. Their concierges were able to get me some reservations at decent restaurants but they were not my first choice. These restaurants were good sushi but a bit touristy and the chefs were not of the same caliber as I got to try later during my visit. The breakfast is great. Both the western and japanese options offered in their buffet are of good quality and variety. I normally don't think highly of hotel breakfasts and only have it when I'm in a hurry but I ate here everyday. The staff were extremely kind and helpful with everything. Once I left my room a little late at night to grab a light snack outside of the hotel. While I was walking on the road a hotel employee who had just gotten of her shift asked me whether I needed help and went out of her way to direct me.

This time we had an unusual, not up to Hyatt standard interaction with a Young male -not Japanese- during check in process and later during our stay. I am afraid he did not seem sincere, had poor choices of wording and poor timing in offering information. More in detail: We -spouse Jonathan and myself, Ricardo- booked two rooms, one of them through Founders Club destined for the use of mother in law. At check in time he welcomed us by saying something along the lines of ""Welcome, Mr Solines we appreciate your loyalty, you can check out by two pm... you will have to check out at noon, he said to Jonathan"" (?) No one had inquired about check out then so that was unnecessary and made anyone that was not me unimportant and less than. Silly, really. We requested of him the two rooms be on the same floor -any floor - to be closer to mother in law but he said that was impossible at the moment... In another example, the same guy, when asked about the location of a pharmacy where to buy medicine for a small cold sore Jonathan had developed on his upper lip (I asked him about Abreva- he tried to help, but after a few phone calls he informed us that a Doctors prescription was needed and that being the weekend no doctor was available. ""I am sorry we could not help with... your sickness"" He said while looking at it like Jonathan was growing a second head!! Kind of funny the whole experience with this person, but not really funny. A couple days in Kyoto we were easily able to get the medicine at a pharmacy with the help of our wonderful personal guide. I must say that while our general impression of this member of your team was poor everything else was as expected: We had drinks at the rooftop bar with out Tokyo friends, ate lunch an the Andaz Tavern and had buyers at BeBu a couple times and everything from lobby to room was Andaz perfect.","Madrid, Spain","RangeHospitality</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Madrid, Spain</strong>",66,3.0

So perhaps this review will be bias (then again most are).Locationwise, the hotel is a good walking distance away from Shimbashi station, but the taxi service downstairs is well supplied for those who are willing to pay for it.Front desk service is very discreet, as there is no actual desk for one to walk up to. Rather, the staff invite you to wait at a waiting area while they complete your check-in. Room-permitting, they'll ask if you would like to upgrade your room to a better one, usually for a discounted price (I already had one with a view of Tokyo Tower, so the next upgrade would've been a suite at 75% the price, I passed).The room itself had a very clean, minimalistic, with a fusion of Japanese and Western culture in it, with green tea and coffee amenities.Service was quick and always professional with every staff that greets you to seemingly know your name (or perhaps my name was too easy to remember).The bathrooms were one of their most outstanding points, the bathtub was a medium sized, round, jacuzzi-style, bath tub, with seasonal bath salts (autumn for me) provided. Connected to the tub was a rainforest style shower with amazing water pressure (big plus for me).Facilities - This was a staycation for me so I got the opportunity to use their spa and athletics facilities. The gym is shared with tenants living in the apartment complex (same building, ridiculous rent), but rarely used by anyone. New high tech treadmills, weight machines, and free weights. The pool was extremely well lit, and great for tanning or relaxing.At night, ending with a spa service which was revitalizing and soothing.The restaurant served a delicious lobster risotto with a seasonal soup.","Tokyo, Japan","TokyoEats128</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",7,5.0

This is possibly the best way to splurge on a couple of days in Tokyo and let the rest of the budget balance out with Air B&B's. The entire property is nothing short of stunning, particularly given the fact that the hotel rooms START on the 46th floor with the lobby on the 51st. This should give you some idea of the views to be had of Tokyo. Nothing at this place is short of first class and even though expensive, unlike some other large chains, you never get the feeling of being gouged. To the contrary, all in-room snacks and non-alchoholic beverages are free and there is a complementary wine and sake reception every night. The service and staff are beyond compare without making you feel as though you are being fawned over. Add this to the fact that, in Japan, tipping is rare, and one gets the feeling that the level of hospitality is genuine and not geared toward financial gratuity. We didn't eat at the Andaz Tavern, but its quality is well-reviewed elsewhere on TripAdvisor. Hats off to this boutique hotel for achieving near-perfection.

This hotel is the latter. The Andaz is one of the first hotels I have seen without a front desk. The easiest way to explain the check in process is like walking into an Apple store for technical support.... except with much better staff in a beautiful setting. You are seated in the lobby's lounge area and go through the check in process right there. After that, you are given your hotel key where you head DOWN to your room (that's right haha, down!) Our room was on the 47th floor, making it the highest hotel (and nearly highest building) in all of Tokyo.Before I go into detail about the room, I have to attempt to explain the view. Understand, people pay good money (Willis Tower, Chicago) to see views like this. The windows in the room are floor to ceiling and you are literally looking down at the skyline of Tokyo. Because of the buildings height, the hotel has a 360 degree view of the city - there are no bad rooms here.The room itself was separated in two main areas. The bath area and the bedding area. The bath area was exceptionally large and offered a beautiful rainfall shower head, oversized tub, enclosed toilet area, safe, minibar, and dresser area. From there you walk into the room itself which is bright and fun. The bedding area reminds you of your friends house... just warm and inviting (but with a much better view).Although we didn't get to use the spa, it seemed extremely high end. Wish we had more time to experience the spa! They have a bar of herbs, salts, and other items that they will blend according to your personal feelings, colors, and relaxation goals.The fitness center was large, uncrowded, and one of the most professional centers I have seen in a hotel. The machines were brand new and very high end. I'm not much one for working out, but even I had to try out the treadmill!I'm not huge into art, and I am not much one for design; however, the Tavern (hotel's restaurant) was a master piece in every aspect.

And, unlike the Bill Murray movie, absolutely nothing was lost in translation! This hotel has captured the best of Eastern and Western cultures in sweet harmony. From the moment you enter the lobby in the 50-story tower called Toranomon Hills, you realize you are in a very special place, with outstanding architectural and design elements. The sweeping views from our suites were stunning, and the decor had a modern Asian vibe while also being very comfortable. (I personally enjoyed the high-tech hands-free toilets!) The staff was friendly and highly professional, with flawless service throughout our stay. The breakfast buffet and drinks at the rooftop bar were terrific, though the room service menu was a bit limited. All in all, it's easy to see why this hotel has rocketed to the top of lists of favorite hotels in Tokyo; it's one of the best places I've stayed anywhere around the world.","Greenwich, Connecticut","TGIF103</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greenwich, Connecticut</strong>",21,5.0

There are only 4 floors for guest rooms, from floors 47-50, so no matter what room you book, you are guaranteed a VIEW of Tokyo. South wing gives you the Skytree and Imperial Palace grounds; North wing gives you the Tokyo tower and Imperial Palace grounds. Checking in: far different from other hotels I've stayed at, you are welcomed in a lounge where you are offered a choice of coffee, tea, juices, or wine, while they check you in. After which, you are shown to your room.Rooms: Room has a walk-in closet, separate toilet and baths. Decor is mix traditional and modern Japanese design. There is a yukata which you can use. A traditional Japanese tea set is adjacent to a Nespresso machine (mix of traditional and modern, right?). Drinks in the minibar are complimentary, except alcohol, and they are restocked every day. Smallest room size is 50 square meters, which is A LOT in a city known for its space limitations. The view at sunrise, sunset, and in the evening is spectacular. Makes you want to stay holed up in the room. There are a lot of power outlets, including beside the bed, so it's very convenient. Toilet has a motion sensor, so when you go near it, it automatically opens itself. It flushes itself also, just in case you forgot to flush. There is some sort of jacuzzi bath besides the rain shower, so you can have a warm bath with some bath sea salts (one of their amenities).In short, this room spoils you.Service: It is impeccable. Staff are all warm and helpful. Airport limousine bus takes you directly to and from the airport. We asked the concierge for the bus pickup schedule and they gave us not only that, but also purchased the bus tickets for us. It was effortless. They answered all our questions regarding getting around Tokyo, gave us maps of nearby areas, train maps, and all kinds of maps and references. The lounge offers small bites in the morning with coffee, tea, juices, or wine (wine may be available only in the afternoon to evening, i'm not sure.) So you can wait there forever and not mind at all.Breakfast: It is limited. There are not much choices. Mostly Western food of pastries, fruits, sausage, bacon, eggs. For me it is enough. The view from the breakfast area is enough to fill me. Service during breakfast is excellent. Staff were all very attentive. Rarely did I call them to have my coffee refilled. They approached my table when my cup is empty and ask me if I want a refill.Gym and pool are on the 37th floor, along with the Spa. All areas offer you views of Tokyo.There's a rooftop bar on the 52nd floor, a chapel, and a small sushi restaurant. The rooftop bar offers open-air spectacular views of Tokyo.Bottomline, this hotel spoils you with views, doesn't scrimp on space, and does its best in making you feel at home in Tokyo. It's a hotel that's hard to leave and say goodbye to.Nearest station is Toranomon station of Ginza line (10-minute walk).

There are several convenience stores nearby, Mini Stop, Natural Lawson, etc. Andaz Toranomon Hills is an oasis in the hustle and bustle that is the city of Tokyo, I would recommend this hotel over any other hotel in this vast city.Finally it is really worth mentioning the staff. Check in took a little too long for my taste (my flight was delayed and I was really tired, I just wanted to go to my room). But other than that the staff was outstanding. During my stay I spoke to a different staff member every morning about where I was going, they really showed interest and even researched things for me. One day I returned to the room after having spoken one morning to a staff member and they left a hand written letter saying they hoped I enjoyed the day and it had been a pleasure speaking with me. This kind of detail really stayed with me. Finally upon check out, which was seamless and took literally 3 minutes I spoke with the Front Office Manager Andrea Lobo. She was kind and showed true interest in my opinion about my experience.I am returning to Tokyo, with my mom this time, and I know where we are staying: Andaz Tokyo Toranomon Hills, here we come!!!","New York City, New York","Sebastian P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",170,5.0

So I would just lay it down.- the lighting design is good. Room design looks nice but some what unpractical (I.e. Free standing mini bar looks nice but very inconvenient. Their bath tub reminds me of Egymptian tomb - no window, no tv, just a red marble wall and yourself)- this hotel has of those ""hidden"" entry design. The problem is, if you are going to hide it, you need an educated staff to guide you. When I was checking in, no one was there, found my way up to lobby, also not a clear check-in table, so I had to grab a staff myself. - food is good. Their room service was tasty, the down stair cafe is superb. They also provide free drink and snack at the lobby whole day.- staffs are kind. They try their best to help us. But my feeling was they are not trained / experienced yet. We asked for restaurant at Aoyama, it took them more than 30 minutes to find it. But again, they try their best if I ask.

Round wells but not jetted and feature a bizarre step, which makes it hard to fully immerse yourself comfortably. 2) gorgeous spa and pool area but the pool effectively has only three lanes, one of which is reserved for sports club members.

This is a world class hotel; I'd recommend it to anyone.WHY YOU'D LIKE THE ANDAZ TOKYO1. Fantastic rooms. Aesthetically beautiful and interesting. Comfortable beds. Spacious bathroom. Nice views of Tokyo Tower if you are lucky. Rooms are practically soundproof.2. Impeccable service. Staff is super friendly and warm. I forgot my iPhone on the bus from Narita - no problem. The front desk called Tokyo Limousine bus, they found the phone, I received a note letting me know when to expect it from the bell desk. I only remember the name of one staff member - Sakai-san from the morning - but everyone had the same level of warmth and positive energy.3. Food and beverage is amazing. I was able to have breakfast included due to my Diamond status. Everything was delicious, especially the pastries and the Japanese items. I had already eaten breakfast at Tsukiji market but I ate anyway. There's lots of elbow room in the restaurant, which is really nice in Tokyo.4. Adjacent restaurants in Toranomon Hills complex. These restaurants are extremely high quality and are used to dealing with foreigners. As a result, the restaurants are more accessible than most in Tokyo for non-Japanese speakers.5. Gym. Really luxurious. I had not seen such modern treadmills in my life (and I have been to many hotel gyms). The pool looked really nice too but I did not use it.6. Goodies in room. There were four bottles of water for me, some rice crackers and a few other snacks, a couple of cans of Coke and juice. All of this is included in the rate.7. Internet is amazingly fast. Fastest I have ever experienced in any hotel.WHY YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THE ANDAZ TOKYOI preface this by saying these are not deal-breakers or complaints. I always try to point these out because these points may concern people.A. Location for limousine bus to Narita is not great. (I assume it's good if you are arriving from Narita). You need to add another 30 minutes driving around to other hotels prior to heading to the airport. I recommend getting on the bus at Royal Park Shiodome instead (take a cab there). If you are going to the hotel from Narita a backup option is the bus to Tokyo Station (get out on the Marunouchi side and take a cab).B. Subways are pretty far away. It's a good 10 minute walk to any of the subway stations.C. Not much shopping in the immediate area.D. Suites are expensive and not available for upgrade. If you are traveling with two kids you will need two rooms.If you don't mind the above points, by all means stay here!!!

The room was sized well for Tokyo standards and the shower/tub combo was fantastic. And while it is the norm all over Japan to have the automated toilets, the one at the Andaz was notch higher than a lot of other hotel toilets I've seen. As a Hyatt Diamond, I was able to take advantage of the breakfast every morning. Breakfast was superb -- probably my favorite breakfast buffet to date at a hotel.

When you arrive on the airport limousine, you are immediately greeted by attentive doormen who escort you to the hotel's stylized private entrance and instruct you that check-in is located on the 51st floor. Check-in was informal, efficient and managed by well-trained and welcoming staff. Admittedly, the layout of the floor requires some effort to orient (e.g., the elevators for the rooms are separate from those that transported you from the hotel's entrance). There are also a number of small sitting areas that are cordoned off by large decorative cabinets that makes visualizing the lay of the floor plan a little challenging. But once you are oriented, you appreciate that the hotel is beautifully and thoughtfully decorated. The corridors to the room are decorated with Japanese motifs. The room, like the rest of the hotel, is also exquisitely decorated and the floor plan is unique and functional - it feels very much like a home than a hotel. Finding and discovering the variety of drawers, cupboards and safe was an adventure - as they are built into the decor - I love it. Amenities were great - there was a rain shower in the bathroom that provided ample water pressure as well as a large soaking bath and the toilet had the expected array of controls that one could partake as needed. Lighting and curtain control was accessible and easy to operate - the view from the window was impressive (because of the height). Wifi was fast and free. The gym had a very nice locker room and was well equipped with a variety of equipment - it also offered a sauna and whirlpool. Breakfast (buffet) at the Andaz Tavern was very good - although it was slightly expensive. Staff throughout was excellent - they were high attentive, polite, helpful, friendly and professional. I thought this was a super establishment - and would return if the opportunity presents.","Boston, Massachusetts","Seng100</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",193,5.0

There were several things that bothered me and my wife, chief among them is we felt preferential treatment was given to white guests. I don’t want to get into racism claims, but white guests received more proactive attention and better service than I did as a Hyatt Diamond. It was evident to me, and I’ve voiced my opinion on Flyertalk that there was obvious differences between how Asian (Chinese in particular) guests are treated versus white guests. Had it happened once or twice I may have overlooked it, as it could been my own personal sensitivity BUT sadly this was not the case as it happened repeatedly throughout my stay. I plan on drafting a letter to Hyatt to address my concerns in hope Hyatt will investigate. I also urge Hyatt to contact me directly so I can address my specific concerns about this property.I also want to point out another unsatisfying FACT about this hotel. The room we stayed at had a condensation (or was it a water leak?) problem that would cause a puddle of water to collect near the windows. This problem never went away during our stay and while apologies were offered and housekeeping wiped and cleaned, there was never an offer to move us to a room that did not have this ""condensation problem.""

If you ask me, this is harder to achieve than the common subservient, rigid, almost robotic service you get at many Asian hotels.On arrival, we checked in to the lounge and were offered a soft drink before we headed to our room. The lounge is a lobby in disguise, with a more relaxed feel and long benches where guests are encouraged to stop for a drink on their comings/goings from the hotel, with alcoholic drinks and snacks from 6pm-8pm nightly an added incentive. If you need more privacy or cocktails, simply head to the main bar (but you must pay, of course).Our room was the entry-level king, but it still had all the features and great views of northern Tokyo, just not Tokyo Tower. Not sure that's worth the extra cost but would be a nice upgrade treat, for example. The TT views are available to all guests from the bar and the pool, which is among the best I have used at hotels of this class/style around the world. And best of all, guests don't have to pay to use it, which sadly is the case at many Japanese hotels.The fact rooms are on the floors below the lobby takes a little getting used to at first .. rooms are on levels 47-50 and all have a large entrance hall, massive bathroom, separate toilet, shower room and a large walk--in wardrobe.All the amenities, especially the towels, were top class. I want to buy those towels!Nothing was too much trouble for housekeeping - they shined my shoes and delivered them back to the room. They also serviced the rooms extensively twice a day - much more effort than I have seen in other hotels.Yes, it's expensive, yes, it's not in the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku/Ginza .. but is that what you want when all that can be a walk or subway ride away? We loved the quietness of the district at night and in the mornings, having Toranomon Koffee just downstairs was the perfect way to get moving each morning.We made extensive use of the pool and change facilities which were all excellent.We did not eat at the hotel so cannot comment.We are already planning a return trip to Japan next year and will definitely consider staying here again - the only reason we wouldn't is to experience a different location, nothing to do with the hotel itself. we loved it.",Australia,"jetfueljunkie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",67,5.0

I should preface/ qualify this review with the fact that I had stayed at the Park Hyatt the week before and was therefore quite spoilt by the time I got to the Andaz. It is also clearly a business hotel while my review is written from a leisure traveler's perspective.Service: The level of service is I suppose normal for a 4-5 star business hotel. As mentioned, perhaps I was spoiled by the Park Hyatt but I was surprised that there was no one to accompany us up to the lobby and we had to find the check in area ourselves. Since the design was very modern, it wasn't immediately obvious to us (after a 10 hour flight) as to where the check in desk was. The restaurant recommendations from the ""Andaz Host"" (they do not have a concierge department) were also disappointing. Room: The rooms were smaller than the Park Hyatt but still spacious for Japan. They were chic and I liked that they had a long desk facing the window. However, the room design was problematic. Not disastrously so, but enough to be annoying (especially given their pretty expensive room rate):-1. The bathroom is connected to the wardrobe/ luggage area. There is no door between the two. After even a quick shower, the wardrobe area became a bit humid from the steam. This was ok for one night but probably not ideal for a longer stay.2. The problem with not having a door between the bathroom and the wardrobe is that if you were staying with a friend you can't access the wardrobe/ luggage area while the other person is using the bathroom. Therefore we had to put our suitcases in the entrance corridor of the room (it was the only area in the room where one could fit big suitcases). Which led to the problem in para. 3 below.3. The door to the wardrobe area and the bathroom were along they same entrance corridor. These doors open into the entrance corridor. When opened, they take up 70%-80% of the width of the corridor. This means that in order to access our suitcases (see para 2 above), we cannot have the bathroom/ wardrobe door open at the same time. It also means that one needs to be careful when coming out of the bathroom/ wardrobe. This gets very annoying when there are two people packing in the room the night before/ morning of the day of departure. 4. For ladies, the vanity kit/ mirror is on a strangely high shelf in the bathroom. The design of the bathroom is such that the mirror at the sink is a bit too far away for doing makeup (you have to stand and lean quite a bit over the sink to see properly and the lighting in any event not conducive to doing makeup) so one has to use the vanity mirror. However, I am 5'3'' (normal for Asia) but was only at the right height for the mirror in 3.5 inch platform heels. The mirror is moveable but the only place that you can conceivably move it to is the long table next to the bed/ in front of the windows (no space in the bathroom). Again, not disastrous, but quite annoying. Pool: The pool was surprisingly small but given that this is a business hotel I suppose it is normal. The facilities were new, though, and the changing room was relatively big with steam, sauna and ofuro facilities. Accessibility: Toranomon underground station was 3-5 minutes' walk away. It is on the Ginza line and so very convenient. The hotel is also near various business districts so probably convenient for business travelers.Overall, I do not think the hotel's room rates are justified (it was more expensive than the Park Hyatt). As a leisure traveler, I would stay elsewhere. However, this hotel is probably quite good for lone business travelers.",Hong Kong,"chezzz88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong</strong>",40,4.0

Small smart cool details everywhere. Beats the rooms at Park Hyatt Tokyo. Free Wifi, free soft drinks in the mini-bar and firm beds are 3 extra points as well.Service is good and they are not all over you all the time which I think is good: Friendly and efficient. We never used concierge services so I don't know if they deliver or not. We've been to Tokyo a number of times and manage our own stuff.Location - there are some comments here and there about the location of the hotel - that it is far away from tourist sights. For me Tokyo is not about tourist sights so I'm not sure that I understand those comments. If you want sights - go to Kyoto or Beijing. Tokyo is about state of mind, hole-in-the-wall places in hidden back streets that you find in any part of the city and so on. Yes, Toranomon is a bit of an office-area and not on the great Yamanote-line, but it took us 15 minutes to walk to the Imperial Palace, a few minutes to Toranomon subway station that serve Ginza, Aoyama, Shibuya and Asakusa.

The Tokyo edition sits on the 47-52d floors of a skyscraper in Toranomom. The views are spectacular, although if you are in town for a lengthy stay, the vertical commute tires and I wouldn’t want to be in this hotel in an earthquake. The Good: the rooms are small but well laid out with lots of wood and stone; a zen take on a cruise ship, with more spacious bathroom designs than most Hyatts in Asia and the most functional lighting switches I’ve seen in a hotel room—a series of heavy metal toggles with no reostats and no sconces or nightlights that can’t be tunred off from bedside. The beds are good and given the height above street level, the rooms are totally quiet. F&B is OK—the sole restaurant--all day dining -- has spectacular views. The downside is that the edgy architectural vibe has been allowed to trump practicality in a number of cases—the room numbers are set just above floor level so the weary traveler looking for their room may take some time to find it and the layout of the lobby — more wood panels and low lighting-- is mazelike. If Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson do a ‘Lost in Translation Two,” this would be a good location for it. It's also a good place to have lunch or a drink and take in the views. If however, you are a business traveler to Tokyo, (sans ScarJo…) you may find it not as well suited for your needs.","San Francisco, California","Expat094</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",10,4.0

Conveniently located, albeit many comments about it being far away from the hustle and bustle. It's a 5-10 min walk to the Toranomon subway, which is a few stops away from Ginza and a few more from Omotesando. The airport limousine (buy tix at the aiport, available at both narita and haneda; for return trip, can buy tix at Andaz front desk) also stops right outside the hotel entrance, which is extremely convenient. Stayed at a standard room on the 49th floor. View was spectacular even though we weren't facing the Tokyo Tower (had frds who did). I would recommend people to spend a little extra to stay at the tower view rooms (can see both the Tokyo tower and also the Mt Fuji afar). Had dinner at the Tavern on the 51st floor. Ordered the seasonal set menu (seafood mostly, scallops, crab, lobster, fish, etc). Nice ambience. Staff were attentive yet not instrusive. There's room for improvement on food quality though. Food's ok, but can be better compared to the superb quality of the room and service overall. The crab and lobster didn't have the freshness odour and taste which they should supposedly have. Fish was overcooked. Staff recommended a Japanese white wine (Toriivilla 2012), which was interesting since it's not commonly available in other restaurants or outside Japan. Sweeter than the chardonnay, but still a good pair with seafood in general. Ordered a birthday cake last minute after closing of pastry shop. Really appreciated the staff for their help and effort in delivering the cake and making the celebration of my partner's birthday a memorable moment.

The moment I walked up to the hotel and gazed up at the 52 floor hotel, I had to rub my eyes to make sure I wasn't dreaming. The hotel looks absolutely stunning from the outside in the day or night and I could only marvel at what a beautiful building it was. It was an experience in itself checking into the hotel, with the reception lobby located on the 51st floor! Once you're in the elevator, there are only buttons for the first floor and 51st floor! There isn't a conventional reception desk but more of a casual lounge where you are greeted by the warm, friendly staff who explain everything you need to know about the hotel and offer you a welcome drink. I was also signed up to the Hyatt Gold Passport as an added incentive. I stayed here for two nights in the Andaz King room on the 50th floor. Upon exiting the lift, walking the long winding corridors to my room I felt a sense of excitement. The moment I opened the door to my room, I was amazed and in absolute awe of the hotel and the room. The room was ridiculous (in a good way)! The size of the room was huge! Walking in and seeing an enormous king sized bed, with 4 soft lovely pillows was exactly what I needed on my last 2 nights in Japan! There was a couch that extended the length of the room and the view from the 50th floor truly felt like you were on top of the world! There was a large 42 inch TV, nespresso coffee machine, complimentary water and soft drinks/juices in the minibar and other drinks such as green tea. You were also provided with a tea pot and two tea cups.They had the large shower head in the shower and there was also a deep soaking bathtub. Bath salts were provided. There was also a walk in wardrobe area, where an ironing board and iron were provided. I also believe there was a complimentary shoe shine service which I didn't utilise.The hotel also provides a gym and indoor pool and these are world class! The view you have from the 37th floor would make anyone want to exercise or go for a swim! The health club was also on level 37 but I ran out of time to experience this but I'm sure it would have been amazing too! On my last night, I dined at the Andaz Tavern and it was fantastic, nothing short of what I expected. I checked out the rooftop bar but didn't stay long enough for a drink but the view is to die for! Also, you have an amazing view of the Tokyo Tower at night when it is lit up, it truly is a beautiful sight.I needed to checkout early on Saturday morning to catch a flight and the hotel staff were very accomodating to my request and made my checkout seamless and got me a coffee for my travels.Overall, this hotel is a must for anyone wanting to experience a world class hotel. I honestly can't speak more highly of this place and if I ever get the chance to come back, would stay here in a heartbeat. I thought I would feel out of place, being a solo traveller and not exactly being the trendiest guest but the hotel staff were all so lovely and made me feel welcome, I didn't feel out of place.

The Andaz Toranomon Hills is one of those unique properties that sticks with you, even well after you have departed and returned home.The hotel is located on the top floors of the current tallest building in Tokyo (SkyTree and Tokyo Tower are not buildings officially) which affords all rooms excellent views of the city. I would argue that these are the best views of Tokyo as you can see Tokyo Tower, Skinjuku, Ginza, the Imperial Palace, Tokyo Bay, the Rainbow Bridge and even Tokyo SkyTree in the distance! Waking up to stunning views and returning to the city all lit up at night is nothing short of breathtaking.This particular trip was a treat for a big milestone birthday for my Mother. The hotel treated her like a special valued guest including a special cake-treat on arrival to the room and a lovely set of flowers. On arrival to reception, she was greeted with a very warm Happy Birthday and well wishes. I requested a room with a view of Tokyo Tower and was provided with one which was lovely as I appreciate that there are not many twin rooms with a view of the tower and the hotel was at full occupancy. The staff also made sure that we did not have to wait too long on check-in as we arrived early. We arrived at the hotel at 1000 with the room available by 1100 (3pm standard check-in).The hotel itself has a very contemporary and boutique-style feel and is well suited for both business and leisure travellers. It is accessible by a myriad of subway stations within 5-10 minutes walking distance and is also only a 15 minute walk from Shimbashi station which is also very handy.The facilities are second to none with a state-of-the-art gym affording excellent views of Chiyoda (with SkyTree in the distance) all the way to Shinjuku. The Pool is absolutely gorgeous and is big enough to do laps and has floor-to-ceiling views of Chiyoda (with SkyTree in the distance) and the Imperial Palace area. The changing room facilities (I can only comment on the male facilities) has a lovely hot onsen, large sauna, showers, massage chairs, newspapers/magazines and some healthy snacks (e.g. nuts, fruits and cereal bars). The hotel has a part-open rooftop bar and a lovely lounge bar/restaurant in the lobby on the 57th floor. I can't rate this hotel high enough and will certainly be returning to this hotel on a future visit to Tokyo.","London, United Kingdom","Pookgai</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",7,5.0

It has the typical high level of service seen throughout Japan. I checked in late and as I walked into my hotel room, I remembered how great the Tokyo night view is. Even tho my room was a basic rectangle, the layout of the closet openings and furnishings didn't make it feel like a typical hotel room. The control panels for the room are physical switches, not buttons--finally light controls that don't have buttons that distract and glow all night (except the privacy switch). There is one sink in the bathroom vanity. The room wasn't as soundproof as I would have expected. The person above me was tromping around a bit and I could hear voices from next door.I originally was a little weary of the location but was happy to explore a new setting. It's in kind of a ""middle of no where"" quiet area with a lot of restaurant alleys. Amazingly, somehow it is not connected underground to a subway station and underground shopping (like many other hotels). All the subways are a bit of a walk away but once you get your bearings down it's easier to know which way to exit the hotel. Pedestrians are banned from the hotel car/taxi circle so you have to go all the around or up to enter the hotel from certain directions.There is a 20m pool and 3 different co-ed baths, plus a hot bath in each locker room. The gym is standard hotel gym that also has a rower. It seems the gym/spa has a membership base but it was never that crowded in the pool.The hotel always seemed very busy. At check-in, you hang out in this small area that is packed with people doing who knows what (why aren't they hanging out in their hotel room?). The public areas aren't that wide open so it always feels like there's people everywhere. The hotel complex has a few floors of restaurants/business downstairs, and I was pleased to come across a small no-frills massage place Sula on the 3rd floor that offers head and face massage (things hard to find in NY and not done that well).

The lobby is on the 50 (51?) floor and has an amazing layout with high ceilings and dark wood paneling. The checkout area is a huge seating area where the Andaz staff invite you to sit while they finalize the check in paperwork. They offer free non-alcoholic drinks and snacks while you wait for the check in to finish. The staff all spoke very good English and were friendly and inviting. They showed us to our room which had a beautiful layout with an fantastic view of Tokyo with peakaboo views of Tokyo Tower. Simply beautiful. The room was super clean and had amazing looking furniture. No expense was spared in this hotel room from automatic window shades to a wood paneled dressing vestibule. To put it simply, I wouldn't mind living full time in a room like this. The hotel restaurants all were great though pricey. The hotel also had an indoor swimming pool with great views, a well stocked gym, and a spa treatment area. I didn't partake of these amenities because I was on a business trip, but my friend who traveled with me got to swim and said it was divine. The hotel also had free continental breakfast in the lobby and free wine tastings in the evening. And the food and drinks were good not just because they were free.

We managed to secure an early check in- 9am as our flight landed. As our cab pulled up we were greeted by name and whisked up to the 51st floor for a very efficient but relaxed check in before being taken to our room.We booked the tower view room which didn't disappoint at all- stunning views over the city. The bathroom and room were exceptional and the room and in fact the entire hotel felt light, bright and spacious.Our favourite thing about the entire hotel was breakfast. The food was stunning but even better was the service. I've stayed in many high grade hotels and breakfast service is usually of a much lower standard than dinner- not here! The breakfast team were continually striving to deliver excellence and went out of their way to ensure our every need was taken care of- one of the Managers even took the liberty of booking us a table with a stunning view across 2 of the days without us even having to ask. There was lots to choose from and lots to eat- so much so we skipped lunch most days in spite of walking up to 8 miles a day seeing the Tokyo sights! The concierge team worked really hard to help accommodate us too. I'm a vegetarian which has proved challenging across the entire trip but the Andaz team worked super hard to help and find us great locations for dinner. We spoke with many of the team and they were all equally as helpful and gave us a lot of their time to ensure we had the help we needed. Location wise for us the hotel was perfect- I couldn't have dealt with the craziness of Shibuya every day/ night on holiday. 2 tube stations sit very close to the hotel (around an 8 min walk) and easily get you everywhere you would want to go in Tokyo. Do not let the location of this hotel put you off- the tube is very easy to use and very cheap! To put this statement into context, we had dinner one night at the Park Hyatt and from what Google maps told us the closest tube station was a good 20 mins walk away which was really inconvenient (and painful as I had to walk it in heels!)I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and just hope we get the chance to visit again.Just to finally mention, we did have a slight query with our room during our stay as we decided to stay one extra night as we loved Tokyo and the Andaz so much. We contacted Arnaud the GM directly via email and everything was efficiently sorted the same day.Thank you Arnaud and your wonderful team for a fantastic first experience in Japan. It was truly second to none and has made our trip super memorable- we have used our Andaz experience as the bench mark for the rest of our stay in Japan and nowhere has lived up to the experience you and your team provided. We hope to visit again very soon. ","Manchester, United Kingdom","AbigailWright</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",2,5.0

Beautiful local touches in the Decor can be seen throughout. Walnut tables and vanities in the bathroom. Staying true to tradition, the rain shower head is located next to the bathtub so you can rinse off before soaking.Every morning you can come downstairs to complimentary fresh juice and pastries and in the evening free cocktails for a couple of hours. The room includes complimentary water, tea, snacks and even a Nespresso Single cup espresso maker. We were provided a room on the ""low"" 47th floor...needless to say the views are spectacular. Even though we were on the opposite side of the Tokyo Tower the view definitely did not disappoint. The rooms are decorated in very good taste and everything is controlled with switches located right next to the bed. Big rooms compared to others we have stayed at in Japan. I found myself enjoying time working just so I can stare at the view while looking up from my laptop. The service you are given, along with the attention to detail at the Andaz Tokyo is impeccable. Some do complain about the location, but if for some reason you can't enjoy the 5 minute walk to a metro station there is always a taxi waiting at the lobby. We rather enjoyed being away from the hustle and bustle at night but close enough to be there within 15-20 minutes. There are many nice little Cafes just outside the building if you prefer a quick or more local breakfast outside the hotel. If you have the opportunity or are indecisive, the Andaz will not disappoint.","San Diego, California","MAIS77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",11,5.0

That's not easy when you are 50 floors up in a new skyscraper!The check in which is carried out in the open living area is informal and a welcome drink is offered. What I personally dislike which happened here is that without my asking I was offered an upgrade to my room for 2 different prices depending on size of room. I politely declined, and then when I queried whether my room faced Tokyo Tower, I was quoted another additional cost for such a room. Maybe it's just me, but if you are prepared to upgrade then just do it on a complimentary basis or don't offer at all! If I had wanted a higher grade of room, I would have booked such at time of booking!Anyway, we were then escorted to our room which really was beautifully appointed with stylish decor. Great view towards Tokyo Skytree (having declined to pay a surcharge for the Tokyo Tower view), extremely comfortable bed and lovely bathroom. No real negatives about the room at all.The hotel also has an indoor swimming pool with excellent adjoining jacuzzi area which was great for relaxing aching limbs after all the walking you need to do in Tokyo. Also offered were complimentary drinks and canapes for an hour in the evening in the living area. This was miserable for such a high class hotel. A bottle each of white and red wine plus sake. And just one kind of canapé plus 2 kinds of Japanese snack. It looked pathetic sitting there on the table. We were the only guests there and didn't bother to return the next day.But that is really just a minor negative which the hotel could easily improve on if they wished to. The main disadvantage of the hotel is its location. Firstly, we only realised later that our taxi had dropped us off at a small side entrance on the main road. We had to find our own way and bring our luggage by ourselves to the reception floor. The main entrance is in a side road which it seems taxi drivers are not so familiar with. The nearest subway station is about 10 mins walk away and is not a major station therefore requiring changing lines at other station hubs. So be prepared to take taxis if you don't want a lot of walking exercise. This is not a cheap option in Tokyo! As the hotel is in a commercial building and a comparatively new business area, the area is pretty much dead in the evenings. Trying to find somewhere to eat in the mall below at about 8pm, everywhere was closed, about to close, or no customers.So don't get me wrong, I really did love this hotel in many different aspects. But its location has to be seriously considered before staying there.","Hong Kong, China","Edwinbearlover</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",18,4.0

We are so pleased we did as this hotel exceeded our expectation in every way. Due to bad weather we had to postpone the second part of our trip which was to the Maldives and so we ended up extending our stay at the hotel for an extra three nights when we returned from Kyoto since we loved it so much. It is hard to put into words a feeling that you get when the hotel you visit leaves you with that warm luxurious feeling but that is exactly what Andes did for us. Our room’s design was impeccable with a perfectly designed space for everything and yet the design hides everything away leaving a smooth clutter free beautiful space to enjoy. The floor to ceiling glass windows giving us a spectacular views of the Toyko city skyline reminded us of the movie ""Lost in Translaction"". The location is perfect as it is in central south Tokyo so we could get around the city relatively easily either via the Tube or taxi. My husband likes to run whenever we travel so he enjoyed running around the Imperial Park every morning which was only a 10 minute jog from the hotel. Given the fact that my husband and I do not speak Japanese, we relied heavily on the concierge to give us recommendations of where to eat. I can honestly say that every place they recommend for dinner was spot on. All the restaurants were small, intimate and away from the touristy crowd with absolutely delicious food. They also helped us to find a wonderful Ryokan in Kyoto because everything we tried to book was not available.The spa was my favourite part of the hotel. Sitting in a carbonated hot tube overlooking Tokyo’s skyline felt very indulgent and the design of the spa and facilities left us feeling so relaxed we both fell asleep the first day we used it because we were able to comply switch off and forget the rest of the world. The staff of the hotel were very welcoming and friendly and we felt that the staff genuinely wanted to ensure that we had an amazing stay. None of our requests seemed to much and they went out of there way to accommodate us and make us feel special. Being world travellers and having stayed in many top hotels in the world, we have to say that hotel overall, this is one of the best we have visited. We have already started recommending this place to our family and friends and when we visit Tokyo again this will be our go to hotel.","London, United Kingdom","blanche m</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",1,5.0

We had taken a cab over from the Hyatt Regency Tokyo (about 3000 yen) after a two night stay for our final nights stay in Tokyo and it was about 12:30 pm. The Motor Entrance collected our luggage and all we had was our hand baggage. When we made it to the 51st floor, Check-In person Mommi (SP.?) had escorted us to the Guest Lounge area and offered our party of 4 beverages while taking care of our check-in. We were informed that our rooms, which were adjacent, were NOT ready, so we would need to come back at 3. We were offered the ability to use the Spa prior to our rooms being ready. We were ready for lunch so asked for a recommendation for a casual, noodle place. We were referred to a local noodle place 2 blocks away that was good & inexpensive. We also asked for a restaurant recommendation for dinner. We told her we wanted a mid-priced Japanese Restaurant, and we narrowed it down to a Tempura Restaurant in Ginza that was about 10,000yen pp. Mommi would make a reservation and email the confirmation to us. At lunch we had decided that we didn't want to travel to Ginza for dinner, and wanted to stay very local, so I started to do some research on my phone (T-Mobile worked GREAT, BTW) We still had some time to kill before check-in, and with my parents in their 70's and 80's we decided to walk to a nearby park several blocks away and relax a bit. While there doing my mobile research that I noticed the Toranomon Hills complex contained several other restaurants. After a short, relaxing rest in the park we walked back to the hotel to check out the other restaurants in the complex. As I walked into Pirouette, I knew immediately that's where I wanted to have dinner. We made a 7:30 reservation. I highly,highly recommend this Farm-to-table Creative French Restaurant! Although there is no English menu, we assigned a Server that had a good command of English and was able to translate the menu for us. The 5,000 Yen Prix-Fixe 4-Course Menu was beautiful, creative and delicious! We got back to the hotel at 2:45 and our rooms were ready. In interest of shortening this review, I'll give you some info now via bullet points. * Assigned a standard room on 47 facing the Imperial Gardens.* Used the Fitness Center & Spa. Beautiful space, great equipment in the Fitness Center with actual weight training machines and free weights (Unlike the HRT). Locker room facilities excellent (Missing Steam Room) VERY HOT Sauna.* All day access of beverages in Lounge Area a great benefit! EXCELLENT coffee from the automated machine -your choice of coffee type.* Cocktail hour very nice benefit, enjoyed a couple glasses of Sake!* Received a Financial Times newspaper in the morning.* Requested and received a 2pm late checkout. (Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum Member)* Morning Breakfast buffet very tasty but EXPENSIVE(10% Gratuity added) the Nutella Brioche French Toast is yummy (You have to ask for it and ask for 2 pieces - they are small and the size of a slice of French Baguette!)* Checked out the bar on 52 and it's an interesting space; there was a DJ spinning tunes and pretty crowded at 9:45pm.* Airport Limousine Bus is an easy way to Narita from the hotel; purchased the tickets from the hotel. As an architecture and design buff, this hotel probably was the nicest place I have stayed design-wise.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Kwokpot</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",0,5.0

The Rooftop Bar is a little more upbeat than the 51st floor lounge - we enjoyed the very well made cocktails on the 51st floor lounge with a live piano player in the background. The service was impeccable throughout our stay - want 4 ice cubes for your Japanese Whiskey nightcap in your room? Not a problem - they'll bring it right to you. Every request we had was met with a definitive yes and was acted upon within 5 minutes. This is just not the standard in hotels around the world any longer.

They even keep the water receptacle filled for you! :)The ONLY cons to this hotel would be the price and a bit of a walk to the Metro system (10-15 minutes depending on your pace).

The hotel is quite new, having opened for less than a year. Andaz is under the Hyatt group. It’s a more hippy, layback in style and position somewhere between Grand Hyatt and the more luxurious Park Hyatt. ArrivalI arrived by taxi after checking out from Shangri-la which I had a great stay once again. The vibe and style of the Andaz is distinctively different. First thing one notice entering the hotel is the very modern architecture style adorning the public areas. Most of the staff are made of up young good looking people who seems friendly and eager to help. Check-in was swift and I was escorted to the room and explained about the features. No upgrade was given despite my Virtuoso status but irregardless, the room is quite nice so I did not complain. The room has a size of 65m2 with an enlarged bathroom and a large foyer / corridor which kind of waste the space. There is a large table with a long sofa that makes up most of the room. The bed is king size and positioned quite low but otherwise it’s comfortable enough with quality bed sheets. The bathroom has an extensive shower room with great water pressure and a gigantic deep soaking tub that can easily accommodate two or more adults. In particular, I love that long table and sofa where I can layout my laptop on one side and have food and drinks at the other or just relax in the long sofa seat. The furniture and fittings are of good but not luxurious quality but the room is well equipped with modern electronics like electronic curtain coffee machine. Most of the electronics and lighting are very intuitive and easy to use, which is not to be taken for granted. A simple bedside control with analog switches can turn on or off the lighting, on or off the curtains and other controls. There was no need to deal with hard to press control panel buttons or worst, a wireless iPad or similar tablet device that takes a geek with an Einstein brain to operate and still doesn’t work most of them. A lot of hotels nowadays are keen to implement these features but made them so complicated that it takes an Einstein’s brain to figure it out. Other amenities include free non-alcoholic minibar and even the tibits and chocolates were free for staying guest and are replenish daily. Internet is free and super-fast. At the 50th floor, the room has a distant view of the skytree and theTokyo bay. Other than that, it’s not a particular nice view at night as the hotel is in an office area and nothing of interest nearby. So it's not the ""sea of lights"" view that we expect from skyscraper hotels facing the busy Marunochi district or the bustling Shinjuku area. It’s a comfortable room but sound proofing is not good as I can hear noise from the street when there was a outdoor concert nearby. Fortunately it only lasted only 8AM. Common Areas and LocationThe hotel has one main restaurant called the Tavern which serves breakfast, weekend brunch and all the day dinning. There is also an adjacent bar. One floor up and there is a sushi restaurant which I did not try or visit. I had breakfast and Sunday brunch at the Tavern and find the food rather mediocre and I will say the hotel’s F&B standard needs improvement. For better value for money and also better food, there are some interesting restaurants nearby ( 10 to 15 mins away by taxi ), just ask the hotel staff to recommend. The hotel recommends and helps me booked a nearby Teppanyaki restaurant which turns out to be excellent. The hotel also have a common hall with large tables and communal seating, which serves free drinks and alcohols and tibits during happy hour. It kind of resembles a club lounge but for all hotel guests. I am not a fan of communal seating and prefer my own table for privacy. Others may not mind. This place was very crowded during the evening. I end up taking the food during happy hour to my room and the staff happily obliged. The hotel has a large gym and spa with swimming pool located at the 37th floor. The décor was very “Zen” and relaxing. The gym has nice exercising equipment and modern amenities. The hotel is located at Toranomon Hills, a mixed used complex housing the Andaz hotel, some restaurants and shops and an office complex. There isn’t anything very interesting within the building or the surrounding area are all office building. A subway station is conveniently located nearby and it’s about 2 stops away from Ginza. I will not say the location is ideal. It’s rather quiet and lack of atmosphere at night. ServiceNothing much to complain as all service request were attended to quickly. Not very pleased with my view, the hotel graciously offered me an upgrade to the more premium Tokyo Tower room but I find the view there to be equally unexciting so I decided to stay at the same room. On my second night of stay, there were some noise from an outdoor concert in the street and again I complained and they offer a room switch immediately but since it ends at 8AM, I decided also not do. Overall, nothing particular outstanding but I find the staff very quick to respond to service request and quite obliging as well. For a short stay, this is fine. ConclusionBasically, this is the “W” version of Hyatt and there are many similarities between the two. I quite like this hotel but the location is not ideal and their F&B needs improvement. The rate is on the high side also and may not be value for money for some. It’s all down to individual preferences. I would not mind staying at this hotel but it is not my first choice which is the Shangr-la.",JAKARTA,"BENLEE123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>JAKARTA</strong>",775,4.0

The service ahead of check in was excellent, with swift and helpful responses to queries about a late check in and a transfer from Haneda Airport. The hotel arranged a private car transfer, but also offered advice on a number of other (cheaper) options. For the return journey, to Narita Airport, hotel staff arranged tickets for the Airport Limousine Bus, which picks up from the hotel.The hotel is on the 47th - 52nd floors of Toranomon Hills, one of Tokyo's tallest buildings. Views from windows in all directions are very impressive. Check in was smooth, and carried out over a drink in the lounge. The layout of the hotel is potentially confusing at first, but easy to get used to. The ground floor of the building has the hotel's taxi rank and car entrance, as well as a pastry shop and restaurant operated by the hotel. The building is large, so there are a number of other entrances, although the the hotel does have its own well-marked entrance from the street. The lobby is on the 51st floor, accessed from the ground by a dedicated lift, which we never had to wait long for. Also on the 51st floor are the main restaurant, the Andaz Tavern, and the residents' lounge, as well as function rooms used for weddings etc. Rooms are on floors 47-50, (ours was on the 48th), accessed from the lobby by another set of lifts. As these three lifts only serve those floors, again, we never had to wait more than a few seconds to get one.The hotel's design is contemporary but not wacky, with lots of natural materials and a definite Japanese minimal influence. Our standard King bedroom was a great size, with a large bathroom featuring a big circular bath and separate rainfall shower. Oh, and of course, a very Japanese toilet ;) Privacy in the bathroom is excellent; it is possible to have two fully closed doors between the toilet and the bed.The hotel's location is in a quieter, more business-y part of the city, with little nightlife nearby. Public transport links, however, are excellent, with at least three metro stations within walking distance. The nearest, Toranomon, is a 5-10 minute walk away. This suited us very well, and we were able to get around a lot of the city very easily.Finally, I cannot overstate how good the service at the hotel is. Staff were friendly and eager to help, even when we came back to the hotel on the first day having failed to obtain any money (short version: you have to use an ATM in a 7-11 or a post office). Many staff speak excellent English, and those who didn't were very patient with my lack of Japanese.Overall, whilst this is clearly not a budget option, the Andaz delivers an excellent experience, and I'd leap at the chance to stay there again.","Liverpool, United Kingdom","Alex H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Liverpool, United Kingdom</strong>",0,5.0

While the hotel indrastructure is beautiful, its location central (yet far from public transport) , there is a clear issue with staff training and service attitude.As you would expect, the hotel is new, Andaz style and very nicely decorated. Any rephrasing of the other contributors' positive comments would be using up readers' bandwidth. if you are looking for a great looking hotel in Central Tokyo with fittings of this decade, go here.If you are looking for Asian hospitality and Japanese style welcome, don't!Front office is a weird mix of checkin and welcome desk and concierge, of counter and sit down somewhere else, with plenty of trips back to the counter for passport scanning, credit card swiping and what not. The staff is overwhelmed with all but the basic tasks or anything that isn't in the textbook. My checkin experience was horrible. the staff member's only concern was to verify my rate credentials. My business card was in the luggage - which kindly enough was taking care of on the ground floor - and didn't show up in my room until I had to head out, about 30 minutes after my arrival. I was summoned orally, through an escort to my room and in writing to show my business card and bring it to them straight away ... or face a higher rate. Appealing to some reasonable sense of customer service triggered more incomprehension.... Anyway, after my luggage had shown up and I was back in yhe evening, the matter was solved. I had warmer welcomes at Novotels in Russia, though.Not to mention that I wasn't told about the spa facilities (which are gorgeous), the happy hour in the lobby for all guests (which was OK only, given the patronage of families holding court in a rowdy fashion) or the rooftop bar (where you should reserve a window seat before showing up).Concierge services aren't existing. Even the simplest of questions (like a good yakitori restaurant nearby... really?) leads to good looking youngsters scrambling in their computer for hours, not to much avail indeed.... it's what you get when you privilege procedures over substance in staff recruiting and training.Some time to go until the 2020 Olympics.I probably won't be back.

One of the reasons is that our destinations this time are closer to this side of Tokyo, whereas Park Hyatt Tokyo and Hyatt Regency Tokyo are closer to the Shinjuku end.The walking from the Toranomon subway station is not too far. The check-in area is just like Park Hyatt Tokyo that it's on a higher floor. It does take us a while to figure out the way to the elevator (guess we didn't enter via the car area so no one was escorting us like Park Hyatt Tokyo). But after once or twice you will know the way.Unlike Park Hyatt Tokyo which performs check-in inside your room, Andaz Tokyo has an area with a few tables for you to sit down, enjoy a drink and check in. They accommodated our early check-in request (around 11am) as well as late check-out (around 3pm) without additional charge as I am a Diamond member, and the room has been upgraded to a Tower view room. The lady even brought it up proactively if I had sent packages to the hotel - because I've asked about this over email a week ago (and eventually I didn't send any packages).The tower view room has nice big windows facing the Tokyo Tower and easy buttons to manipulate the curtains. The couch is so big that it's from one end of the wall to the other end, and two people can probably lie on it at the 2 ends of the couch!!! There are so many more visible power outlets (than Park Hyatt Tokyo) that it's more work/business friendly.Bathroom consists of a few areas. The part that trumps Park Hyatt Tokyo (in a standard room) is the bathtub which is round and spacious. My wife also told me that the handle allowed her to get out of the bathtub more easily without worrying about slipping (than the one in Park Hyatt Tokyo).Shoe shine service is just like Park Hyatt Tokyo. I called them for pickup, and they gave the shoes back to me shortly.The minibar in the room has free non-alcoholic drinks and snacks! Yes, FREE!!! Coke, green tea, water, sparkling water and different types of crackers and chocolates!There's no chance for me to enjoy the spa, but the gym has a nice city view though. One new thing to me is the separate gym areas for male and female. If you and your spouse (of opposite gender) would like to work out together, sorry, no luck here.Breakfast has a pretty healthy buffet selection. I asked if there's menu (just like Park Hyatt Tokyo) but the waitress said it's all buffet. I ordered omelet from the counter and he brought the omelet to my table quickly.There's no English communication problem with any staff members in the hotel. The staff members are more courteous and of a different style from Park Hyatt Tokyo - Andaz Tokyo has a more friendly and casual style of courtesy, whereas Park Hyatt Tokyo has a more serious style (but both with lots of smile of course).I have yet to try another Grand Hyatt Tokyo which is not too far away, but given the nice experience here at Andaz, I will simply pick Park Hyatt Tokyo or Andaz Tokyo depending on my Tokyo activities. If I visit the Shinjuku/Shibuya area more often, then Park Hyatt Tokyo, else Andaz Tokyo for the Tokyo Tower/Odaiba side (and Hyatt Regency Tokyo if it's a business travel with limited budget).","New York City, New York","KY L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",32,5.0

If you have stayed at other Andaz hotels and found them wanting - perhaps in the quality of finishing, for example - I absolutely would not hesitate to stay at this Andaz. In fact, the difference between the Toranomon Hills Andaz and those on Wall Street, in Shanghai, West Hollywood and to a lesser extent London, is quite marked. The only minor downside of the hotel is that the Toranomon Hills location is perhaps not as convenient as Marunouchi, Shinjuku, Tokyo Midtown or Roppongi Hills but for us this was a minor consideration.","Hong Kong, China","Justin267</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",26,5.0

The hotel is not known by taxi drivers but the building it is located IN -Toranomon Hills, Is known. If you are using trains, take the Ginza line to Toranomon station and take Exit 4. Coming up from the exit, go to the very first block (there is a Pronto sign on the side of the building) and turn right. Walk about 3 blocks and the small street will dead end at the Toranomon Hills building. Once you enter the building the actual Andaz entrance elevators are discreetly located. You have to take the special Andaz elevators up to the 51st floor for check-in. The rooms are located on floors Below the lobby and to get to the rooms, you need to use a different set of elevators than the one you came to the lobby in from the 1st floor (that 007 feeling, lol). The lobby is beautiful (see pic) and a place you just want to relax in which the hotel staff welcomes you to do by offering free drinks, cookies and anything else you might need as soon as you sit down. Small lobby acloves are nice when you want more privacy. The staff here are top-notch!! The view from both of the rooms we had here were amazing (see pic)!! Save a little money and don't get the offered upgrade Tokyo Tower view room as all the views from the Andaz are great! Spend the money you just saved on the room upgrade to book a Spa visit at Ao. My daughter and I got the 90 minute oriental massages and were very impressed! Only two complaints - there are many different lights in the Andaz rooms but several could only be turned off by the master switch which then turned off all the lights. Second, the breakfast is extremely overpriced for the selections offered (about $50 USD per person). There is a small cafe across the street, if you need a breakfast fix, I suggest this instead. The 52nd floor bar is a ""Must Do"" at night - while you are staying here! Breathtaking views with a cool vibe. Overall, the Andaz has very beautiful rooms with amazing views and a five-star staff!! Hotel is more for couples, business men and women or families with older teens. Location is ok, if you are willing to use the trains / subways during your stay - then you can easily get to popular areas such as Roppongi, Harajuku or even Shinjuku without switching trains too many times from the Andaz.","Auburn Hills, Michigan","beachbums2009</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auburn Hills, Michigan</strong>",72,4.0

Due to a delayed flight I arrived very late in the evening, but I was impressed with the smooth check-in process. The Andaz Tokyo is somewhat unusual in that there is no actual front desk. Instead, I was escorted to a large desk to the side of the spacious lobby, where staff stood around facing Macbooks. This gave a cool and stylish impression, although some might prefer a more traditional front desk. As a side note, most of the front staff seemed to be non-Japanese, which felt strange for a Tokyo hotel, although it did add to the cosmopolitan ambiance of the hotel.Since I arrived late in the evening, the lobby area was deserted. The lighting in the lobby was very low key, making it impractical to do anything such as read or work. (To give a sense of how dark it was, staff could be seen inspecting the area with flashlights!) The massive wooden table in the lobby was nice, but clearly not meant to be used for any practical purpose, since I could not find any power ports to plug in my laptop. Since there is no business center in this hotel, I found this inconvenient. Clearly this hotel is not meant for the business traveler.Although the staff member who checked me in specifically mentioned that free drinks and snacks were available in the lobby, I later found that there was nothing available at this late hour, which left me hungry and wondering why he mentioned it. I did find some the next morning, although I was somewhat disappointed that only two types of pastries and juice were available (I was able to order an iced coffee.)Also the next morning, I had the opportunity to use the pool and gym. As with the rest of the hotel, the design was ultra-modern and stylish. However (unlike the Park Hyatt Tokyo) there were no staff stationed in the pool area. This might be preferable to guests who might simply want to take a quick solitary swim, but perhaps not to others, such as families or those who might need to call upon the staff for assistance.Later on, I needed to print out several documents. As mentioned above, the Andaz Tokyo does not have a business center, so I was asked to either provide the documents on a USB stick or email them to the staff at the front desk. Since I did not have a USB stick I had to email the documents and wait for them to receive it in their inbox. After an awkward several minutes, the email still had not arrived so I was asked to send them again, to another email address (which thankfully worked). There was also a charge of 100 yen per A4 page, which they only explained to me after they brought me the printouts (For comparison, you can do the same thing at a Kinko's or Seven-Eleven for around 20 yen/page). The whole process of printing out four A4 pages took about 20 minutes. Overall I found this system impractical and somewhat old-fashioned for a brand-new hotel. Some sort of wifi or cloud printing capability would have been nice.Overall the Andaz Tokyo is a nice, modern hotel, but definitely not one that is geared towards business travelers, or those who might need to use certain practical amenities.","New York City, New York","hgny76</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",12,3.0

Located on the uppermost floors of the Mori building in Toranomon, the tallest actual building in Tokyo (2nd only to Skytree), this hotel has it all. Some people have mentioned that the Andaz concept is harder to implement in a city and culture like Tokyo, but I felt they've executed it very well. While it's not exactly ""mi casa su casa"", the staff really tries to make you feel comfortable the moment you step in. No overly formal greetings or language, but the classy Japanese touch such as walking you to elevators and bowing slightly really blends the cultures well. The living room area is nice as well with private nooks and crannies available for relaxing or quick meetings. There's always juice or coffee or small snacks/pastries available as well.The lobby is located on the 2nd highest floor so you have to take the elevator up then down for the rooms. The large indoor pool and spas, as well as separated men and woman onsens is one of the largest in Tokyo, where square footage are worth gold. One complaint that families may have is that this is not really a kids space, as the ambiance goes more for upscale and could be a little less inviting that families would like. However this is a plus for me, and really is one of the more unique pools I've been to.The rooms are well appointed, with larger than average size for Tokyo. Rooms are either facing Tokyo tower, or the Imperial Palace, and being one of the tallest buildings you get a great view of all directions on clear days. The rooms while not that big, is nicely organized. I especially liked the long couch area where you can just sit and stare out the window and admire Tokyo from above. I didn't choose to eat at the hotel but the restaurant looked pretty popular among local business people as well. Instead I would recommend the dry aged Kobe beef restaurant located in the same building on the 4th floor. Very good prices for lunch and the beef is exquisite, and will ruin your taste for beef anywhere else in the future. The concierge here can help hook you up. This is my top choice for staying in Tokyo, probably even over their sister hotel the Park Hyatt. The location I feel is just much better since Shinjuku is not exactly central to the rest of Tokyo. The hotel is located about 8-15 minutes walk from 4 different metro stations, and hence 4 different metro lines. The only thing might be that the immediate area is a business office area so may not be the most happening at night, but there are some night spots around the area, especially Shimbashi where you can check out the local nightlife. Another slight improvement I would suggest is to feature a little more prominently their rooftop bar, maybe with a happy hour or something. It can be a little dead at night and that's a shame given the space's obvious potential.","Chino Hills, California","milty908</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chino Hills, California</strong>",279,5.0

I love the design and concept of Andaz and so was excited to try out the Andaz Tokyo. At first I was worried about the location and that it was geared towards business folks, but my stay turned out really well for our vacation.Check in was pretty quick and done over a communal table while we were served cappuccinos. I politely asked if there was a chance to get a room facing the Tokyo Tower, but the associate said it would be an upgrade with a fee. I declined.Our city view room still had nice views and I don't think it was a big deal because the next morning, it was a very cloudy/foggy day and you couldn't even see the tower so it worked out in the end. What I love about Andaz is their HUGE and beautifully designed bathrooms. The Bathroom space practically was the same size as the living/sleeping space which was already quite spacious. There was a great round tub in addition to a shower room. I love Japanese toilets in all their high-tech glory and wish the rest of the world would embrace the same! Another great feature of Andaz are the complimentary snacks and soft drinks in the mini bar which get refreshed daily. The snacks are local and are true treats and the soft drinks are abundant. We had an early morning check out so we unfortunately could not experience more of the facilities than we had hoped. We did a walk through of the pool and fitness center and it looked top notch. The Andaz vision is really great for those aesthetes that like to combine beautiful art and design with warm and inviting luxury without the highbrow haughtiness. I chose to stay at the Andaz instead of the Park Hyatt (which I'm also a fan of) because I thought the Andaz was more fresh and in line with my personality/vibe whereas I thought I would enjoy the PH more later in my life (hah!). Overall service was efficient and nice enough. Everyone was willing to help. The most helpful was the associate down near the entrance/taxi stand who helped us situate ourselves when we wanted to take the metro to Shibuya and Shinjuku, also making sure we had umbrellas in tow to weather the rain. The Toranomon station (Ginza line) was an easy peasy 5minute walk straight up out the door so very accessible to the rest of the city. My initial concerns of the location were totally unfounded and found it to be a nice respite to return to after a busy hectic run through the buzz of Shinjuku or Shibuya. I'd certainly stay here again in the future.","Honolulu, Hawaii","J_Carino</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",6,5.0

This was our fourth trip to Japan as a family and our first time staying at the Andaz Tokyo. We stayed at the Andaz for the last three nights of our trip (and we stayed at the Park Hyatt Tokyo for the first two nights of our trip - I'll post a separate review for the Park Hyatt).Upon arrival we wheeled our luggage from Shimbashi Station into the ground floor of the Toranomon Hills building and found the elevator to the Andaz (which occupies floors 47 - 52). We later discovered the covered arrival area where taxis pull in and out. I suspect if we had arrived at the property in that area, someone would have assisted us with our luggage. We're pretty much do it yourself travelers so we didn't mind at all. We checked in on the 51st floor, which acts as the Andaz lobby (although it's referred to as the Andaz Lounge). We were seated at a large table and offered refreshments while we checked in, which was a different approach for us - I really liked it!Our standard twin room was on the 48th floor and even with an extra rollaway bed there was enough room for luggage. The windows stretched from the floor to the ceiling, which made the view even more dramatic. The nightstand was equipped with a control panel that allowed you to turn all lights on and off and open and close the window shades. A Bose mini bluetooth speaker was provided which paired easily to our phones for music. The minibar was stocked with complimentary non-alcoholic beverages and a few complimentary snacks which we really appreciated. Items containing alcohol were also available, but not free.I really liked that free coffee and danish is available in the morning between 5am and 10am and free wine, sake and snacks are available between 6 - 8pm in the Andaz Lounge.It's a less than 15 minute walk to Shimbashi Station, which is on the JR Yamanote line, so it worked well as a launching point to almost anywhere in Tokyo. Toranomon Station (on the Ginza Line) is also an option and it's a little more than a 5 minute walk from the hotel. There are some decent, low cost dining options and convienence stores (conbini) on the way to Shimbashi Station.The gym facilities are great and it's equipped with the latest equipment. The infinity pool is somewhat small (more like a lap pool with two lanes) but it's really beautiful. Adjacent to the pool is a small carbonated pool, jacuzzi and a separate pool that contains different ""stations"" that offer a jacuzzi type massage for different areas of your body. During our first visit to the pool area, we ventured into the ""outer"" lane of the pool, which is closest to the window. The pool attendant quickly informed us that the outer lane was reserved for spa members and that hotel guests are to use the ""inner"" portion of the pool. My wife, son and I felt pretty self- conscious at this point and wondered out loud why there were no signs posted with this policy. Right about that time, we noticed the sign clearly stating the policy... oops. My son and I then ventured into the ""onsen"" section of the spa. The same pool attendant reminded us that no swimsuits were allowed (this time, no signs posted). There were a couple of other minor incidents that I'm not going to mention, but I guess what I'm saying is that on that first night, we felt a little uncomfortable and we weren't sure of what rules we were going to break next. Now for the good news: Early next morning (6 or 6:30am), I was in the Andaz Lounge when a gentleman asked how my stay was going. It turns out he was the General Manager of the hotel (Arnaud) and I related my experience of the previous evening to him. He patiently spoke with me for a few minutes, which I really appreciated. At around 8:30am (I was still in the lounge drinking coffee waiting for my family to wake up), Arnaud introduced me to the director of the Pool and Spa, Rachael. He had relayed my experience to Rachael and she sat with me to discuss them. I'm not sure that any changes will be made, but I really appreciated the fact that they both were willing to spend time out of their busy day to listen. I think one thing that could help - when they ""check you in"" at the spa entrance, they could ask you if this was your first time visiting the spa. If it is your first time (and it's not too busy), a quick tour of the facilities and a review of its policies might help visitors like us avoid the experience we had on our first night. I should add that once we got the policies down, we enjoyed the facilities immensely.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel when visiting Tokyo. It will be our first choice when we return to Japan.Since the Park Hyatt and Andaz are at similar price points, I thought I'd list some observations:Location: About the same distance to walk to the JR Line (Park Hyatt to Shinjuku; Andaz to Shimbashi). The Toranomon subway (on the Ginza Line) is located a little more than a 5 minute walk from the Andaz as well. I found the neighborhood next to the Andaz to be more interesting, with several decent places to eat. Edge to the Andaz here.Rooms: The views from both rooms were similar, but the Andaz had windows from floor toceiling which we really liked. I thought the Park Hyatt room was more functional and the Aesop toiletries were great, but the Andaz had very modern, dramatic decor (although less space for luggage). The complimentary snacks and non-alcoholic beverages were great. Again, edge to the Andaz here.Hotel: Both hotels occupy the upper floors of a skyscraper so the concepts are similar. The free goodies in the Andaz Lounge throughout the day, were a big hit with my family. Big edge to the Andaz here.Service: I found the style of service to be quite different between these two hotels. The Park Hyatt service was always delivered efficiently, politely, and with a smile. The service at the Andaz is warmer, friendlier, and (although I'm too old to use the term) ""hipper"", which has its plusses and minuses. At times it helped put me at ease, other times it felt a little ""forced"". The staff appears to be younger and less experienced, but I never felt like there was a lack of effort. Both staffs are extremely attentive and we experienced the best service of any vacation we have ever taken.

The guest rooms are located on floors below the lobby, which can be confusing. To enter or exit the hotel you must first go to the 51st lobby floor and then transfer to other elevators that access the guest room floors on the four floors below. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is compartmentalized with special sections for the vanity and sink, toilet, shower and bath, and dressing area and closet. Amenities and furnishings are top of the line. We ate breakfast each day in the Tavern restaurant. The buffet was excellent with a wide variety of interesting selections of Japanese and western items. Portions are small, but that is good because you want to try everything. The mini-custom made omelets were quite good, as were the small bottles of Birchler muesli. Staff throughout the hotel was very helpful, friendly and courteous, but perhaps a little too formal.

Clever and cool, but approachable. The room design was interesting without feeling like it was trying too hard (like a W for comparison). The common areas in the hotel were also interesting and well done, without feeling like were trying to be different for the sake of being different. A subtle differentiation, but one I appreciate.With views out to Mt Fuji (on a clear morning) one way, Tokyo Tower out the other, and the bay from the rooftop bar, you're never left wanting for something to look at.We ate breakfast in the Tavern one day, and in-room the other. Both were excellent. The buffet in the Tavern was of typically high quality and variety found in good Asian hotels. I could sit and eat breakfast there all day!The pool facilities were extremely nice. Expansive views from the lap pool, and common soaking tubs. Some fun hydrotherapy to help regenerate after a long day walking the city. The one thing I didn't love, is that locals can purchase memberships to use the pool facilities. So one day while I was attempting to do some morning laps, there were a couple guys there who must have thought they were training for the Olympics, doing the butterfly stroke, splashing about, racing each other. Not exactly conducive to guests' quiet enjoyment. Especially with only two lanes in the pool. The other several times I used the facilities, however, I was the only one, and very much enjoyed myself.The service throughout the hotel was tremendous. This is Japan we're talking about, so service tends to be pretty uniformly good, especially in a luxury hotel. But I felt the staff was not only eager and energetic, but they seemed genuinely invested in us getting the most out of our stay. Helpful and smiling, giving us good recommendations, always having answers to our endless questions. Service is the cornerstone of a good hotel, and these guys nailed it.I thought the location was great as well. Near good subway lines, and walking distance to several attractions.

Pros: - Unbelievable views of Tokyo Tower and also the Imperial Garden and Shiodome - Rooms are really big with a fresh mix of Asian design with some western influences - Bathroom has a nice layout combination of shower and really big circular bath tube- The place is very quite and the area is a bit off the usual tourist centers in tokyo (this is good if you want to have a calm stay and know where to go)- staff is very friendly - The Sky Garden on the top floor is an unreal place (however you need to ask at the bar to get access) I really don't understand why they don't use this for a restaurant, which would be absolutely stunning Cons:- limited restaurant choices in the hotel (However the breakfast was superbe)- its a little walk to the subway (about 10 minutes) - due to the height of the building you may be uncomfortable thinking about earthquakes","Regensburg, Germany","ChristianKBoston</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Regensburg, Germany</strong>",22,5.0

To date, the Andaz has been my greatest hotel stay in Japan. Big call? Try it, and you won't be disappointed!This is a new hotel. Opened less than a year ago, it's still gleaming. Asking some of the locals for directions was a little misleading, as they didn't know of the hotel. How could they miss it? It's the tallest building in the area, but there is very little signage, with nothing on the building itself. Even directional signs around the ground floor plaza only mentioned ""Hotel"". I could only find one small ""Andaz"" sign in front of the ground floor cafe and bar.Once you find the entrance, the bellhop will direct you to the elevators - taking you to the 51st floor lobby.As is the Andaz style, there's no check-in desk. You will be welcomed to sit at a large table, offered complimentary non-alcoholic drinks and snacks. Relax, sign in to the free WiFi, and the staff member will organise the check-in and room keys. You can return to this area, for complimentary snacks and non-alcoholic drinks, at any time during your stay.Our rooms were actually 2 levels below the lobby level, on the 49th floor. This equates to an amazing view of Tokyo city.We had two interconnecting rooms for our family of five. Our three children in one room; my wife and I in the other. Biggest rooms I have ever stayed in - in Japan. The two rooms made it comparable to a suite, but you get double the amenities! That is, 2 Nespresso machines, 2 huge bathrooms, 2 complimentary mini-bars....what?! That correct, all non-alcoholic beverages and snacks in the mini-bar are free of charge.I must mention the most technically advaanced toilet I have ever experienced. Don't have to touch the seat, as it raises/lowers automatically. Fully adjustable bidet, and heated everything. You won't want to stand up.Super comfortable bed, with block out shades on the massive windows. You will want to admire the view at night - just beautiful.Buffet breakfast was fantastic value and the best quality. With our three children, I only paid for one, and that was half price. Great selection and tastes.I could not fault this place. I remember looking around, at the hip and swanky lobby area; then seeing my 8 year old son skate past in his roller-shoes.

And I am so glad that I did! From the moment we arrived at the lobby (which is not on the first floor, must take an elevator to arrive at lobby level - 51F), we were warmly greeted by the staff and they took us to a table with a comfortable sofa. This I have never experienced before and I was very pleasantly surprised by this ""new"" concept of checking guests in. I have gotten so accustomed to standing at the front desk, handing my passport over and wait for my room keys. The staff at Andaz politely greeted us after they sat us down, and asked if we would like something to drink while taking our passports and credit card to check us in. The entire process was smooth and very thoughtful. Our room had the view of the Tokyo Bay and can I say that the room made me want to turn my vacation to a staycation? Similar to Grand Hyatt, the housekeeping staff did a great job at making sure that all of the toiletries are replenished and that we walk into the room feeling like when we first checked in each day. Also unlike the traditional hotels, the snacks and non-alcoholic beverage in the minibar came free! This may not seem like a big deal but having stayed at many luxury hotels, it is really the small details that keep bringing guests back time after time.The pool was relatively large - 20m, and came with a great view of Tokyo. Beside the pool there was also a carbonated whirlpool and a hot tub. In the change room, there were massage chairs (just like in Grand Hyatt Tokyo!). We also visited the lounge at night and enjoyed the breathtaking view there with romantic candles and live music. The non-alcoholic beverage selection was good, and the smoothie tasted great.Location-wise, Andaz is situated near Shinbashi station. It is within walking distance to Chuo, Ginza (about 30 minutes), and takes about 10 minutes to walk to JR Shinbashin station. But unlike the Peninsula, it is not located right next to a subway station. This didn't bother us at all as we visited in March when the weather was mild and warm, and we really enjoy walking!Last but not least - the pastry shop on the first floor! It had the best shortbread cookies I have ever had in a long time. Try the buckwheat cookies and they will not disappoint you. The pastry shop also has a large selection of eclairs with flavours ranging from sakura to burnt caramel with hazelnut. Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Tokyo, and will definitely return to this property on my next visit!","Toronto, Canada","Pheeburoo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",13,5.0

The hotel is new, clean, modern and sleek. If you don't like the contemporary minimal style then this hotel may not not impress, but for us it was spot on. The room was large by Tokyo standards, comfortable with all the amenities we needed, a spacious walk-in shower plus soaking tub, a desk area with a 9 foot sofa plus the amazing view. The hotel gym is good (access included) with a bank of aerobic and resistance machines, some free weights and a small smith cage. The immediate area is a business district but don't let that scare you off, we found local spots to eat (non-English speaking though), a laundromat and multiple subway stops within a 5-15 minute walk. We walked from the hotel to the Imperial Palace area in less than 20 minutes I believe. The highlight of our visit, though, was our interactions with the hotel staff. Most speak English and helped us throughout our stay (and prior) with recommendations, directions and reservations -- don't be afraid to utilize them for anything. Especially notable were the servers at both the bars in the restaurant and the top floor lounge. After 6 days they were our friends giving us local tips. Oh, and they know how to make American-style cocktails that seem to be difficult to come by when away from the states. Our only disappointment would be the restaurants in the shopping complex of the associated Toranomon Hills building. Overall the Andaz is highly recommended and would be our first choice on our next visit to Tokyo.","Los Angeles, California","jbk100</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",5,5.0

The equipment is very up-to-date as I like to stream Youtube playlist when I work out. They also seem to have Personal Trainers if you want to have some guided training, did not make use of weekend yoga lesson but they have been promoting it a lot (definitely, next time!).Room design was flawless and it would not go out of trend any soon as they incorporate several Japanese elements into the interior. There are delicious sweets for guests to enjoy and lovely turndown service by three housekeeping staff so I totally felt pampered even though I did mess the room much. ^^Came to Lobby Lounge (Tavern?) for quick tea time once, but this was the 4th visit to the Rooftop Bar with my group of friends for some birthday drinks to celebrate after our dinner. Was quoted with some charge for tables which was new to me as I did not know about this in previous visits (I often bring friends who visit Tokyo for drinks here as the cocktails are awesome, they also serve quality cigars). The Bar Manager and Head Bartender Warren (a very nice, talented person whom I got to know in a different occasion) were not there so I did not bother to argue with the staff and just stood outside for other friends to smoke (it was pretty chilly and windy that night). After 20 min of negotiation by another friend, the staff finally let our party sit down in the sofa inside. I guess hiccups like this can be easily avoided by stating the charges clear on the website like Park Hyatt Tokyo does or by the receptionist (which was not manned by anyone that day).Overall I always had a relaxing time at the hotel, and probably staying there again in April with another visiting friend.

The hotel is beautiful. Stylish and understated and finished to a high standard. Service from beginning to end was excellent, even when the hotel was very busy. We found all the staff friendly, professional and helpful (even when things sometimes got lost in translation). Our room at the beginning of our stay was slightly smaller than the room we took at the end of our trip (a corner room with views of the sky tower), but both rooms were well thought out, design led and comfortable. The views in both rooms were also a highlight, especially at night. If you have a chance also use the hotel spa and swimming pool. The spa was one of the best I have been to. The staff there were exceptional, the treatments very professional and the design and feel of the spa made for a very special experience. Our room came with complimentary breakfast. Breakfast was a buffet style with a good mix of more western breakfast choices and traditional Japanese choices. This was my husband's second stay at the hotel (he first stayed shortly after the hotel opened) and he tells me that some of the small teething problems the hotel had at the beginning have well and truly been ironed out.

Service was excellent. Everyone was friendly, all smiles and eager to assist. I've stayed at many 5-star business hotels in Tokyo and sometimes you get the cold / stiff polite types - not here! Warm, young and energetic is what you'll find. Rooms are above average size, not outsized, flow lines work really well. Spacious bedroom. Big round bath for 2, same for shower. Free non-alcoholic beverages from mini-bar (a cool Andaz standard). We had a small upgrade a room facing Tokyo Tower and it was stunning. Romantic both day and night. 2 bench tables for separate work area and keeping putting personal items kept the OCD in me happy. Sofa seat was comfortable enough though not for long working sessions - which you might want to do at the lounge with private booths Gym is very big by Tokyo standard and well equipped to work all major muscle group. Full set of dumb bells - sufficient for most anyways. The carbonated pool in the swimming area is da bomb!! So relaxing with little bubbles massaging your body. Workout clothes, shoes and even swim shorts provided if you forgot yours as we did. Train stations are not far away by Tokyo standards. Toranomon station (Ginza line) is 550m away, connects easily to other line at Ginza station (2 stops away) or to Shibuya (6 stops away).

It is a bit pricey compared to more budget hotels but it makes up for it with what you get. I've read some other reviewers' comment about having difficulty trying to find the hotel. I would have to agree with them. In general, it isn't very clear where the heck the hotel entrance is but I also think it has to do with what they are trying to do with their image; cool, modern hotel that is not trying to shock-and-awe you with bright neon lights and huge signage. When trying to find the place, look for where the cabs are pulling up. Otherwise, find the Audi dealership/showroom. An entrance will be across the street next to a cafe.The lobby is on the 51st floor which I thought was really cool. That is because the hotel rooms are below the lobby (I believe it goes down to the 45th or 46th floor). All the floors below that are residential. My room was on the 49th and, when I walked in, I expected a small box of a room. Boy, was I surprised! You walk into the foyer and to the right you find a very modern looking, open space bathroom. There is also a shower/bathtub combination. Further into the room leads you to the bedroom with one of the best views of Tokyo. It really was a stunning sight. Linens are clean and of high quality. Espresso machine and other accoutrements like water bottles, tea, soda, juices and bar snacks are gratis. Location of the hotel is great for people one business. It is a bit like the financial district in NYC; hustle and bustle during the day, somewhat quiet at night, nice and quiet on weekends. It is close to many of the main train lines so getting to other parts of Tokyo is quite simple. If you like the bars in Ginza, well, you can walk to it and be there in 15-20 minutes and not have to worry about catching the last train at midnight back home because you can walk back! If you don't feel like going out, you can head up to the 52nd rooftop bar. Great vibe, pleasant staff, good food, and nice place to kick back and have a cocktail with a cigar.Bottom line: Would I stay again? Yes, definitively.","Jersey City, New Jersey","victorylow</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jersey City, New Jersey</strong>",8,5.0

I hired a car service to drive me from Haneda to the hotel and even with GPS, the driver had difficulty finding the valet entrance. The signage for Andaz is painfully subtle, so just look for the skyscraper labeled ""Toranomon Hills"" and that's the building.The location is in a business/diplomatic district so the area is dead and like ghost town on weekends. The rooms are extremely well appointed, functional and spacious. The views are dramatic and stunning. Minibar is complimentary for non-alcoholic beverages and snacks. Toiletries are well stocked. Complimentary wine and snacks in the lobby from 6pm to 8pm. The buffet breakfast was underwhelming and not recommended. Housekeeping was excellent. In room dining was excellent. Rooftop bar was excellent. Valet was excellent.The only tradeoff/caveat that comes with most modern/boutique hotels is the staff are mostly younger, usually with less hospitality experience than staff in traditional ""old world"" luxury hotels. It's subtle but apparent that this need improvement.I'd have given this hotel a five star review, however, I took one point away for the following: they claim to provide complimentary newspaper service, yet failed to deliver for both weekend and Monday edition of The Wall Street Journal to my doorstep. Also, checking out was absolutely dreadful. Hotels usually save credit card information at check in, then process any extras (dining, minibar, etc) automatically at checkout. Here, I had to provide my credit card again during checkout, which I found rather annoying. Also, reading previous reviews, i did not experience any sit-down lobby reception for either check in or out.Overall, I would recommended this hotel but would probably not stay here again myself.","Toronto, Canada","grumpykins</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",52,4.0

I've stayed at everything as basic as a Premier Inn (UK) or Hampton Inn (US) or Tokyu Inn (JP) to more exclusive properties like the Westin on Langkawi Island, the Mondrian in the UK, and the Hyatt on Sydney Harbor. I've been staying at mostly boutique hotels the past few years and have fallen in love with the Andaz properties in Manhattan. I come to Tokyo on business five or six times each year. When I first started coming to Tokyo back in 1999, there was this sense of 'awe' that I had because of the 'futuristic' feel of everything. That awe turned into a patina over the years as the economy continued to struggle and things started to feel 'dated'. Lately, I've been staying at the Park Hotel in Shimbashi. It's been perfect in every way and its an excellent property. But recently, Hyatt opened an Andaz here in Toranomon Hills, near the Tokyo Tower and the fish market. Based on my stellar experiences at the Andaz properties in NYC, I thought I'd give this hotel a try. Candidly, I'm a little jaded, having spent the last 15 years moving around hotels. I'm not hard to please- but I'm difficult to impress. This hotel: simply and incredibly awe inspiring. No doubt, the 'newness' of it is a factor, but the execution at this property has raised my expectations to an entirely new level. Style that is amazingly understated. The designers have accomplished an incredible thing - using warm woods and muted colors that are both classic but amazingly futuristic. Small details abound. Toggle switches. Creative lighting. Bose Bluetooth wireless soundock. Drawer pulls and bathroom fixtures that feel like they've been machined on 3D printers. The rooms are huge. Not by Tokyo standards. By ANY standards. I could simply gush about the views, the linens, the bed, the great sound insulation, the work spaces and the state of the art Panasonic HD television. But I need to save my enthusiasm for the service. Like all Andaz properties - no front desk. You are 'greeted' in a beautifully configured lounge area where you enjoy a cold or hot beverage while the staff checks you in with what I would describe as 'a warm and painelss reception'. Service in Japan is almost always the highest caliber, but this entire team feels like a contingent of personal valets. The usual Japanese customer service is threaded into the Andaz model to create a new level of attention. I've only had the buffet breakfast so far (perfect in every way with very fresh and beautifully presented Japanese and Western dishes), but I'm anxious to try the bar and the restaurant, which both look to be on par with the rest of the property. This doesn't come at low cost, of course. But, as I sit 50 floors up looking out over Tokyo, I'm back in 'awe' of this futuristic and perfectly crafted vision of the future. Thanks Andaz for both raising the bar and bringing back a feeling of 'awe' whenever I open my hotel door.

The Andaz brand is a totally new concept from Hyatt. I presume it stands for: Boutique-ish. Exclusive. High-end. At least that’s how I ended up feeling there. It is located in a brand new high-rise called Toranomon Towers very close to the Royal Palace. The lobby is on the 50th floor and the rooms are on Floors 47-50. We had our room on the 50th floor which had a stunning view of Tokyo. You could also see Mt Fuji!!There is a lot of wood in the decor which is Japanese beautiful. The reception is very low key, just a bunch of Macbook Air’s closed down on a beautiful marble table. The restaurant and bar have the same stunning views as the rooms. There are many tables for you to work at, sit down, have a chat with a friend, read a book. The space is very multifunctional and luxurious. And wifi is omnipresent, very fast and very easy to log on.The breakfast buffet was outstanding. Wow! Every morning when I woke up I was looking forward to the breakfast spread.Then there were the rooms. Very spacious, gorgeous bathroom, techie yet functional. Quasi space-age in design with earthy tones. Along the whole window there was a wonderful built-in couch so that you could sit on it and have the stunning view of Tokyo right next to you. I loved spending time in the room especially since I came to Tokyo exhausted and just wanted to unwind. It was a perfect room for that.Lastly, the gym and pool. Located on the 37th floor, not sure if it belongs to the hotel or if it’s a stand-alone club, nonetheless it was equally impressive.This is truly an excellent hotel.

Once you get the hang of the subway it is very easy, and inexpensive, to get to wherever you want to go quickly. Taxi fares to popular places are also not prohibitively expensive.There are great eating options nearby the hotel if you want alternatives. this may sound strange but there's something different about this hotel.

All the other reviews do a nice job of describing the pluses, which I appreciate, but I prefer to nitpick for this review.No bath salts. They have a nice tub but no salts. Every other amenity was available, this seems like a glaring oversight.As mentioned in previous reviews, compared to other western hotels the staff at the Andez has a limited English vocabulary, yet most were very friendly. The one person that did know English well was a pushy gal from India that we all wished we had never met. The concierge staff were nice, but half of them didn't seem to know the city well or did not know the duties of a concierge.Hard beds. If you are aware of the Westin Heavenly bed, think the opposite; ""The Andez bed from hell""Lots of elevators. You need an elevator to get to the 51st floor lobby, then another elevator to get to your room. There is yet a third elevator to get to the roof bar.Roof bar is awful. You feel like you are competing with the mechanical equipment. There are a ton of staff who are very busy ignoring you - I felt like I was in Italy.Most Asian hotels, such as the Westin Tokyo, have a nice club for elites to have a complimentary drink and appetizer before going out. Here you sit in the small lobby amongst people trying to check in while you gnaw on rodent-sized niblets of cracker and drinking swill that they call wine. The free in-room munchies are likewise rather disgusting - fried cookie morsels in wax-paper bags was the best they could muster.This started out as a 5-star review, but after realizing the number of shortcomings, I had to drop it.

The reception area is on the 51st floor, and the rooms are the four floors below, so the views are sensational and the rooms were very spacious. The bathroom is well laid out and roomy. Because this is in the business district, there are a lot of restaurants down back alleys frequented by businessmen. Most of the menus, however, are in Japanese so there was a lot of gesturing, pointing at food involved in ordering a meal. There are two subway stops close by, and I was able to walk to the Ginza shopping area (although wear good shoes and count on a 20-30 minute walk). The hotel is in an office building which I believe is the second highest building in Tokyo and there is an office mall but it's quite limited (so far).",New York,"Irena S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",53,5.0

My only recommendation would be to ever so slightly increase the food options during the breakfast buffet - seemed a bit sparse, compared to the Grand Hyatt's I've been to.

A subtle combination of modern, western, technologically advanced, and Japanese, all come into one seamlessly. To me, this is a combination of Park Hyatt service standards with a fresh and modern take on the decor. I believe the hotel strikes a balance between casual and trendy (Andaz) while retaining the features of the most elegant hotels in the world.I recommend this hotel wholeheartedly. Furthermore, the location is superb. There's not much in the ""direct vicinity"".

Our stay was excellent. My only criticism is that status recognition for Hyatt Diamonds is below average at this property.The hotel itself is in a brand new building that is in an up and coming area of Tokyo. The views from everywhere in the hotel are excellent. The room was very clean and beautifully designed.As a Hyatt Diamond, we enjoyed free breakfast at the Andaz Tavern. The buffet breakfast was excellent and the service in the restaurant was very friendly and efficient. It was a real treat to enjoy my morning coffee with sweeping views of Tokyo!The hotel setup is typical Andaz (which we love), but it is a bit unusual and not suited for every traveler. There is not a traditional front desk/concierge division of labor, but instead there is a front table that handles everything. I think this concept works very well and the front table handled both roles with ease. The service overall was fantastic even though some of the staff struggled with English.I used the gym several times during our stay and it is above average. Like everywhere in the hotel it has amazing views of Tokyo. The spa and pool looked amazing as well, but we did not have time to use them. The spa seems lovely, but I must say that the prices seem outrageous. I have never seen a spa where the average treatment is $200+. I would strongly suggest to the hotel that they consider getting the spa prices more into the $150 area. $200+ is simply prohibitive to most visitors in my opinion.We chose this property over the Park Hyatt Tokyo and we were not disappointed. I would strongly recommend this property to anyone visiting Tokyo. Although some have said that the location is not great, we did not find that to be true.

The Cafe Nire since 1953 in Shinjuku could teach them all but no one learns---we tried to teach the Ritz Carlton for years but failed. With non-over-roasted coffees the Andaz would be flawless.The air quality in rooms was flawless (the only hotel I can say that about in Tokyo) and the sheets and matress firmness was perfect for me (the only hotel I can say anything near that about in Tokyo). You may be different but I slept WONDERFULLY at the Andaz--combination of perfect air, no fiddling with thermostats and humidifiers, and perfect bedding. As it is---this hotel is, for right now---THE ONLY GREAT HOTEL IN TOKYO. It made me enjoy being alive more--made my wife smile and laugh more, made us talk too long and too often to hotel staff, made us enjoy Tokyo living more, eating more, swimming more, hot spas more.

The hotel itself is excellent, the rooms are big enough and very nice designed. I especially liked the big wooden desk and the rainfall shower. We were 3 people in a room, so we got an extra bed. The extra bed was quite comfortable (like the normal beds) but used up quite some space. So I would say the room is quite spacious for 2people, 3 feels a bit cramped (but still OK). The lounge has a nice sitting area with free wine from 6-8pm! The view from the room was spectacular (we had the west view). I ""guess"" in clearer month you might see Fuji-san, but we were not lucky enough. Though I wished I would have gotten a Tokyo Tower View room. The service is very good, but still needs some time to get to the Park Hyatt standard. Dont get me wrong, it was very good service but there is still some things to make better.

I would like to come again!","Ribnitz-Damgarten, Germany","Burgerly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ribnitz-Damgarten, Germany</strong>",4,5.0

However Haneda is not far from Toranomon Hill, there are other nearby hotels where shuttle buses stop more regularly. I took a taxi from one of these hotels to reach Andaz. Going back, it took just over forty minutes and 7000 yen to reach Haneda.The Bell person led to a side entrance, walked across elongated hall with mirrored columns, colourful artworks on front side and series of empty sitting areas on another side. The tall first lift lobby was reached through a narrow 'light' corridor. Celebrating school of fish paper artwork welcomes the guests in the lift car. This was my first experience at Andaz. I do like the idea that guests are checked in within a comfortable living room, it is a simple welcoming gesture yet personalised. There are three private recesses with sofas and a spacious space with two large wooden tables + soft table lamps of 'washi' paper, in early evenings guests are served wine here. My mind noted a gentle scent of perfume at second lift lobby, the charming receptionists from different countries, a sculptural chair at centre, the intricate cut wooden pattern on upper wall over and behind the island reception counter, beyond was Andaz Tavern with aerial wooden sculpture by Charlie Winney. The guest room lift lobby is box like of walnut veneer leading two directions by white panellised corridors with floor level lighting following Japanese architecture of being discreet. The focal point ones sees is a light gold bronze panel of room signage. The guest room foyer feels like a 'genkan' in Japanese homes with two sliding doors to closet and bathroom + a folding brown leather stool so one can take off the shoes. Across there is a blue + white bar unit, a safe drawer unit, and a wooden shelf with its solitary bowl + small black white print. The living sleeping area is flooded by afternoon light, in my case, I could see the Tokyo Tower. In front of these windows, there is a large wooden table with two orange red leather arm chairs to dine and work. The low bed with matching orange red leather bed head + interesting bed side tables, the panellised walls + the same 'washi' paper wall lamp and olive plain carpet make the interpretation of a Japanese (living) room. The blue colour surprises. The use of mirror and granite stone tiles, walnut laminate panels and an oval clay artwork complete o-furo style bath shower room. One almost wishes for a real wooden tub.I enjoyed the Japanese breakfast of miso grilled cod with pickled white spring onion, the Rooftop Bar made a delicious campari orange juice while outside Tokyo was pouring rain. Sitting at high table on blue and white woven cane chair eating Nippon Burger at Bebu and a morning coffee of fruit tartlet at Pastry Shop with its black and mirror graphic sliding doors made the experience. One evening I went to the Tavern for dinner, it was full and I was offered a table at the Lounge instead. The band was playing, the same 'washi' paper wall lamps glowing in this tall space, it would have been great to be seated along the window banquets which were empty instead of facing a glass fire place. Toranomon station is ten minutes walk, down the block one can climb up the steeped steps of Atago Jinja Buddhist Shrine. On one street corner there is a period furniture shop selling interesting pieces. On the other direction, there is also a kimono shop as well two or three restaurants in its original wooden buildings with quaint entrances. On the podium level to office tower, there are more restaurants to choose from as well a grass hill to people watch.The experience of spontaneous hospitality within a sophisticated interior on a local setting, Andaz makes a great stay in Tokyo.","Hong Kong, China","woodbeam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",26,5.0

After a busy day out and about in Tokyo coming back to this hotel was a calming and soothing experience. The staff were delightful, helpful without being obtrusive.Small touches such as the complimentary glass of wine after 6pm in the lobby was lovely. The rooms were absolutely brilliant , spacious and luxurious with an incredible view. The spa was beautiful - we went every evening.

Finding the hotel entrance was not an easy task for first timers, arriving on a crowded reception area filled with people waiting to be seated at the restaurant was not a welcoming experience. BUT.... all seems to go away when I was whisked into the room after a 10 minute wait (which seemed like a looong time). The room is gorgeous! The design is impeccable, the lighting design is perfect and the details beautiful. The photos do not do the room justice, as the space is a lot more handsome.Food in Tavern is not bad, but not amazing. Drink prices are hard to swallow, even for Tokyo standard.Service is not perfect yet, but give it time. I'd go back in a heartbeat when back in Tokyo.

This hotel should not be even in operation. While rooms / interior / pool is nice, the service is terrible. Try ordering tea at breakfast and if it arrives within 10 minutes consider yourself lucky! Staff has poor English understanding. We made several restaurant reservations on advance up find on arrival no information packet ready or maps on location! Unlike Park Hyatt Tokyo or Grand Hyayt Ropponggi, where they give you a package of full restaurant details, Andaz Tokyo forgot what places they even booked for us! After requesting these the first day, they were still not done. When questioned why, the Andaz Host said they didn't have the time! Ridiculous! Then on the second day, we came back at 3pm to find room not even cleaned! I asked to speak to the General Manager, unavailable! Director of rooms was completely useless and said sorry we could not live up to your standards! Is having my room done by 3pm difficult? Do the management even have experience in running a 5 star hotel or do they even care? On checkout day, took over 30 mins to settle my bill as complete chaos! General Manager and director of rooms both in Andaz Lounge / lobby area, did absolutely nothing in looking after guests, these two management people complete useless as just wander around ""looking busy.""

The interior of the hotel is like a museum, with art works throughout the establishment. The Staff are extremely attentive, and are generally eager and keen to please and make your experience as personal as possible. However, it became apparent that staff did have issues with English, particularly at check-in, and the Rooftop Bar. Also staff did not have much local knowledge of the surrounding area, and there is no limousine bus that takes you directly to either Narita or Haneda airports. I have stayed in a number of Andaz hotels globally, so was heartened to discover the newest Andaz hotel would open in Tokyo, coinciding with my trip there. As a Platinum GP member, I chose the hotel stay rate for platinum members, which did not include their free breakfast promotion. The hotel is difficult to get to from the Ginza line at Toranomon station. Take Exit 1 or 7 if you are travelling by the Ginza line, and then look up - it is a short stroll to Toranomon Hills. The entrance to the hotel is around the block, past the taxi drop-off point. I would suggest getting a taxi to the hotel from Shimbashi or Toranomon stations if you have heavy luggage, or are worried about language difficulties. I was left standing around to check-in, asking a number of staff how to check-in when I arrived. Check-in was done standing at the reception desk, and no welcome drink was offered when I checked-in. When I asked where the in-house drinks were in the evenings (5-7pm) I was told they were upstairs in the rooftop bar, which opened at 5pm. This is not true, and free wine is served in the lounge. Visited the Rooftop Bar anyway - the view is very good, but the staff appeared hesitant to serve you due to language inability. It is also extremely expensive, with 2 draft beers and 2 glasses of white wine costing almost Yen10,000 (US$100).The key attraction for the Andaz I believe is the room and the view. The room was stunning - on the 50th floor (1 floor below the reception area), very well furnished, and amazingly quiet. The wall to ceiling windows offer breathtaking views, and the full-length sofa next to the window allows you to sit back and enjoy the view with the complementary non-alcoholic drinks from the mini-bar. The shower has a raindrop as well as a hand-held showerhead, and the round bath is deep and perfect for 2 people. The window also has black-out shades which render the room completely dark - perfect if ambient light is annoying. The Spa and fitness centres are also worth visiting. With extremely attentive staff willing to help you with Spa appointments and how to use fitness equipment, there were a number of plunge baths available to help relieve any stress evident. I had breakfast at the Andaz Tavern restaurant - I admit I was taken back by the lack of selection offered, and the limited choices available. I have stayed at Hyatt Places with more breakfast selections than the Andaz Toranomon Hills. I believe this might be due to the hotel's promotion of offering free breakfast. However, I was paying, and to pay almost Yen10,000 for two people for a small bircher museli and a juice, with a side of passionfruit each, seemed a bit excessive. At check-out, trying to get back to the airport, I was informed that the limousine bus does not stop at the Andaz. I was told to go to the Okura Hotel nearby, but informed that the last bus left at 3pm (I needed a 4pm bus). I instead traveled to the nearby Grand Hyatt Roppongi Hills to get the Limousine bus. You can probably imagine my surprise when I discovered the bus pulling into the Hotel Okura.... I think the staff need to improve their transportation and local area knowledge, but this will probably come in time.In all, I would probably recommend the Andaz Toranomon Hills as a perfect place for businessmen to stay, given the limited shopping and entertainment areas nearby. It is also perfect for a romantic getaway - however be prepared to pay for the view, particularly in the restaurant and rooftop Bar.",,TheLongestHair,36,3.0

To the train to narita and a taxi to the hotel. Hotel is in a quite location. Views are fantastic and the room are pretty nine. I have not tried the food or the pool yet. My room is on the 48th with a view of the palace. Only surprising part. They sat free non-alcoholic beverages on your mini room but you are only allowed to ask for one replacement per day.

Whilst it was a little hard to find the place on foot, it was worth it. The casual check in where you sit in lounges and are served a beverage whilst a ""host"" comes to you would have to be the best check in process yet. The rooms start on the 47th - 50th floor of this building. Great views.The rooms themselves are amazing. The bathroom is the size of a small apartment, where you can lock off parts for the bathroom, the dressing room, etc. The bath is a small pool!The timber desks were a beautiful touch and the floor to ceiling glass opens up the entire room to a gorgeous view no matter where you are. And block out electric blinds for sleeping!At best it is a 5 min walk from the closest metro, but there seems to be a lot of stuff opening up around. It was good to look out at the heart of Tokyo without having to be in the centre of the craziness that is the heart of Tokyo.","Brisbane, Australia","Robyn31</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",70,5.0
