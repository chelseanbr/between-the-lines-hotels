We got the room next door which had just enough floor space for our cases but you needed to step over them to get to the bathroom.Our double bed was wedged into a 3 sided square part of the room so my wife had to climb over me to get out of bed.Our daughter's sofa bed kept splitting into two halves.The bathroom was stolen as a unit from a caravan I think ;-)(we totally understand that in Tokyo rooms size can be an issue but this was farcical)Breakfast was a disaster. On our first morning at approximately 8am we had a 30 minute wait. 2nd morning we came down at 7am and all was good. We came down late on the third morning and the queue was looking like at least 45 minutes so we went back up and came down an hour later and still had to wait 10 minutes.On the plus side the staff were friendly and helpful and always smiling even when surrounded by grumpy customers.Good location close to three Metro stations.,Vaucluse,"MrVentoux</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vaucluse</strong>",8,1.0

When we checked into the hotel, we were told we had a room across the street at a neighboring building call the Vintage. Went to the room, only to find this non smoking room smelled terribly like smoke. Came back down to the front desk to advise and they told us to hang out in the lobby while they cleaned it. Air freshener was sprayed to mask the smell. While waiting in the lobby, their public area /restroom lacked attention (vomit on the floors and toilets).I asked to switch rooms, was given the option to switch rooms for one night and then switch back to a room with a masked smoke smell. Finally, I asked if I booked a 2nd room if we could switch to a room with a king bed and this was agreed upon.Upon returning every time, the floor smelled like there was a sewage leak, walls and doors are super thin, so you can hear anything and everything. Didn’t make it any better that our room was right next to the employee/housekeeping door.Before traveling I was quite excited reading some of the positive reviews. After getting to the hotel I was frustrated and disappointed about the accommodations.I expected slightly more considering I was paying an average of around $230 per night. Had a 2nd reservation for the final days of our vacation and decided that we should move elsewhere.Extra point for location and there was one gentleman at the front desk who tried his best to help.","San Francisco, California","PandaLovesTravel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",24,2.0

First of all, when you book a room that says “annex”, it means it’s in a separate, older building across the street. Because there were three of us, our room had a sofa bed for the third person. It was not at all comfortable, and took up nearly all of the available space in the room. There is about a foot of space between the beds and the wall. There’s nowhere to even put your suitcase, except in the pathway between the beds. There was also some peeling plaster near one of the beds, and the shower curtain smelled a bit moldy.I should also point out that if you see the room listed for less than you paid for it (as I did), you cannot get a refund unless you contact them the day before you check in.The pros are that it’s close to a train station and there are shops and restaurants nearby, but there are nicer hotels in the same area.

We had been on a 12 hour flight so wouldn’t have minded this as much if they would have had shower facilities or a private space we could have at least had a change of clothes. I understood this though as a lot of hotels don’t allow check in until 14:00/15:00. Around 13:30 we arrived back after a walk around the local area as it was quite a warm day and we weren’t dressed accordingly plus a wave of jet lag. We sat outside the hotel and then saw one of the staff wheel over our luggage to the other hotel (hotel vintage) which puzzled me as we had paid a lot of money and expected to be in the main building. I asked at the reception if we could check in earlier as our room was obviously ready and we were tired. She said we could but proceeded then to tell me it was 10% of the room cost to check in an hour earlier. I agreed to pay this even though due to the language barrier it cost me an additional £150 roughly which is a ridiculous policy when they could see we were jet lagged and had arrived so early just to wait for the room that was ALREADY ready. They then told me about the facilities and that because I have tattoos I can’t use them.. I had read this about Japan on the internet but assumed that it would be public baths in the local area that would have this policy. They should really tell you about this as we were really looking forward to using the spa facilities as it was our honeymoon and wanted a relaxing break. So I had to pay 10% to check in 1 hour early plus couldn’t use half the facilities. I felt I couldn’t even argue due to the language barrier but I would have definitely insisted on money back if it would have been elsewhere as I felt this policy was pretty disgusting. The positive stuff was the breakfast was decent and the room, despite not being at all like the photos, wasn’t too bad. The walls had wear and tear also which isn’t great for the price we paid. Overall our experience in Tokyo was lovely and I felt the hotel was probably one of the better ones in the local area it was just a shame about the policies. Rooms were cleaned everyday at various different times which was really good, WiFi box at an additional fee which was also very helpful. 3/5 stars I feel is appropriate.",,JoannaD2757,0,3.0

The staff were also friendly and the room fairly clean. Sent an iron and ironing board up to our room promptly when requested, have us umbrellas one day when it was raining and and booked us a taxi to Tokyo Station when we checked out. Negatives: the main issue was the room size. We have stayed in Japan 3 times now and visited other eastern cities such as Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong etc. but this room was ridiculously sized. We apparently had a free upgrade too so I dress to think what the standard room was like. I appreciate we didn’t spent a lot of time in the room - we were out exploring the amazing city but still the room was frustratingly cramped. You couldn’t swing a cat around in it so it was a challenge at night before bed and all four of us getting ready in a morning. In terms of luggage, for instance, we ended up leaving everything in our suitcases and just putting our suitcases on the window ledge there was that little space.

On your walk to the station, you'll pass by numerous bars and restaurants, a dog/cat cafe, some massage places, and more. And yet, we found our hotel to be extremely quiet; I think we only heard someone talking through the walls once, and we were never bothered by street noise. I was really impressed by the lack of noise and the abundance of things to eat in the area.Our double room was small but seemed average for the places we have stayed in Japan. It was tough to open our large suitcase on the floor, and to open our second bag, we had to use the bed. Whatever. I won't hold this against them because it seems typical. The bed was comfortable enough. Water pressure and temperature in the shower were great. The room had free packets of tea and coffee, too.We opted one morning to have breakfast at their buffet, which is just steps away across the street. It cost about 1900 yen, I believe. This was a touch more than I would prefer to spend for this type of meal, but given the convenience and variety, it was reasonable for one morning. You can also opt to purchase the breakast with your daily room rate, but I preferred to get out into the city rather than eating there every morning. They had a nice arrangement of scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, cereal, noodles, toast, bagels, fried rice, miso soup, and more.We did not opt to use their spa/onsen facilities or laundry facilities, but those are available.Special props to the front desk staff, who were extremely polite and helpful.

The room also comes equipped with a humidifier and air filter. Ours was a smoke free room and my super sensitive nose was fine.

The subway is just 3-4mins walk for heading down direct to Omotesando and Shibuya. You can take the Ginza or Marunouchi line.

First impression of the hotel upon entering the lobby is the amount of left luggages , almost packing the entire lobby space. Must be a really popular hotel. I discovered later that Centurion has a few hotels within the vicinity. As the hotel is enjoying a high occupancy rate , we were able to check in after 3pm only. So we left our luggages with the hotel and went around Shibuya/Harajuku area. Around the hotel were streets filled with restaurants , convenience shops , bars , etc. We eventually check in after 5pm and our luggages were already brought up to the room. We were given Room 1403 which is a family room good for 4. The room size is quite small but consists of 2 queen size beds and a bunk bed which easily fit a family of 4 although the remaining walking space is limited. If you have 2 big luggages , that will take up almost the entire room. The toilet is good size and the bath is separate from the toilet area. Overall , I would say that the room is comfortable for family and consists of all amenities one would expect from a tourist class hotel. What impresses me most is the onsen spa on the 2nd floor which opens 24hours. Male guests can access it for free but female patrons will have to go to another spa located about 2 mins walk in another hotel. The onsen spa is pretty huge by Japanese standard and even come with a resting area with private TV/massage chair. After a tiring day out in Tokyo , one can relax in the onsen spa and ease away the strain and pain for the day. A good hotel for family at a great location with a very reasonable price.

Location (10/10)My first time to bring my family to Japan, and had to start with Tokyo. Booked 6 nights stay via Phil Airlines Swingaround package. Just a few minutes walk from Akasaka Mitsuke station as advertised. Hotel has 14 floors, 70+ rooms only. Hotel is sorrounded by low to mid priced restaurants, a 7-11 is right across, Yoshinoya a block away, numerous restos, bars and ramen shops, currency exchange near the Picasso discount store. Bic Camera is at one of the exits of the Akasaka Mitsuke station.About 4 minutes walk away is Hie Shinto Shrine, 15 mins walk is imperial palace grounds (maybe 30 mins walk up to the Edo Gate). Our room package didnt come with breakfast, but no problem as all these stores and restos were right beside the hotel.The street where the hotel is located turns into a busy nightspot come dinner time. Locals and tourists abound. FromBudget to midrange priced restos, they are here. B. Amenities (10/10!!)1. Room Wifi is thru an android smartphone. Pre loaded with google maps and the browser plus a few others. It is a hotspot when used inside the room. I brought it out of the hotel and 4G wifi was working (cant use it as a hotspot anymore), but used the googleMaps app for navigating around tokyo (all train commutes, and lots of walking to visit shops). Free wifi for us. 2 rooms, 2 handsets. Only restriction is you cant makeHandset to handset calls. It does allow you to call japan mobile numbers for free. I called aFriend in Saitama. No charges to ourRoom. Great savings for us.2. Free Onsen for men (8/10)Yes, the hotel has an onsen, free to use for male guests, women have separate onsen on their other building across the street (wife didnt try it, so no feedback3. Audio/Video- Wireless Bluetooth speaker (8/10)JBL in our other room, our room Had another brand, but great sounding too). TV was hdtv as expected, and i watched WORLD CUP games live.4. Lobby lounge areaWe didn’t have breakfast included, so in some days we ate out, other days we bought some food and drinks from the convenience store and ate together as a family at the lounge. No one else was using the lounge/bar/resto in the morning. They do open the lounge and serve all pasta lunch for 1,000 yen; guests cant use the lounge during that time.Night time large TV was showing live world cup games.5. Money exchange machine at the lobby - USD, Euro, Pounds, other currencies- the rate is not the best, as expected, but if you need some yen to top up your Pasmo Card, this is a convenience worth it. The front desk staff will assist you in using the machine, and pay you in yen.6. Beds, sheets, pillows- all good quality. Not familiar with thread count. YUKATA! - traditional japanese robes were provided, great for when you go from your room to the onsen, or want to dress traditional around the hotel.Shampoo, body soap, shaver, thin room slippers, hair dryer, room safe, mini fridge, small bathtub, All provided. 7. The hotel staff - all English speaking, all smiling, all helpful to the guests. Ask them anything and they will make an effort to respond to your query.",,ReynaldoJ1,6,5.0

The staff is wonderful and helpful, and there are two friendly parakeets that greet you as you enter. As is common of many hotels in Tokyo, the rooms are compact. My husband and I consider ourselves to be light packers-- we traveled with two small backpacks and one carry-on roller suitcase between the two of us, and the room was pretty much at capacity. We had just enough space, but I can imagine that people who pack more heavily, like to spread out, or tend to spend a lot of down time in their hotel rooms when they travel might feel cramped. A couple positives to note that are not noted on this site: there are so many thoughtful little touches that make this hotel great. The best is that they provide a phone that is data-enabled. We found this incredibly helpful for navigation and for searching for little gems while we were out.A couple negatives: I was drawn to this hotel because of the lovely onsen pictures. However, the onsen is men only and tattoos are not allowed. This is common practice for onsens in Japan, but I still felt put-off by that, especially since the pictures are so prominently on the fore of this listing. The thing that really prevented a 5-star rating for me is that the internet was very unreliable on our floor. We got around this somewhat by using the phone they provided in a pinch, but it made it impossible for me to get the work done that I needed to finish-- I ended up going to a cafe because the wifi in my room was so spotty.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","medgoble</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",2,4.0

So I made additional payment to move to 16sq.m. room one night later. The 16sq.m room (which was in a building on the opposite side of the road from the original hotel) was double the size of the 14sq.m one and when I asked to stay in this as it was adequate for my family, they would not refund the extra amount i paid for the 24sq.m..so I decided to move into the largest room ..since I had already paid. So for a 4-night stay, I had to stay in 3 separate rooms and check-in/check-out as many times. On final check-out we left the room at 11:30am instead of the official 11am time and I was charged an extra 4000jpy for late check-out which was unfair.

I liked the location, as it was only a few minutes walk to the nearest train station, which was a block away. There were convenience stores readily available, as well as great food nearby. The room itself was the ""family style,"" which had decent space and was priced fairly for midrange, downtown Tokyo stays. I recommend this hotel for families with kids. The double beds for my husband and I took up the entire half of the room, with a small aisle to walk, and a set of bunk beds for (1) our son and (2) our luggage. The bathroom was great! I was expecting something tiny, but it was sectioned off into a vanity and toilet area (fancy bidet style toilet), and a closet shower/soaking tub. We needed to ship our luggage to our next hotel, and the front desk was able to understand enough English to accomplish this. Between my husband, myself, and the workers at the Centurion, we were able to cobble together enough English to make our stay make sense. I had to laugh at the constant stream of Jazz Muzak playing on the speakers in the room (you can turn it off, but why? It's hilarious). Then, in the restaurant where breakfast is served, we had American top 40. Interesting mix! And on the food note: breakfast is served buffet style in the hotel across the street, and with enough offerings to make both Japanese and Western guests happy. I am a picky eater, and I was as happy as my vegetarian-but-adventurous-eating husband. The restaurant had a cute set up as well, as if you are eating in someone's living room. There are birds in the hobby who sing you a welcome as well. The outdoor ambiance of the hotel is wonderful! You cannot hear anything from your neighbors. When approaching the hotel, you're greeted by string lights, trees, and a patio to eat or drink on. Very well lit. Only issues... peeling wallpaper in the bathroom, moldy floor in bathroom (with distinct mildew smell). I had also been misinformed that this hotel was accepting of guests with tattoos, so I made the reservation specifically so that my husband (who has large back tattoos) could use the gorgeous spa and enjoy his first onsen experience. But they had signs all over that floor that stated tattoos were not acceptable. He asked, just to make sure, and confirmed with the front desk that NO TATTOOS ARE ALLOWED IN THE SPA. Someone had mentioned in a review that this is a ""sex district."" Uh, no. Showing some skin is certainly a way to sell products. Every night we stayed there, my son averted his eyes (still in the ""girls have cooties"" phase of being a preteen) from the girl standing on the corner in her bikini, short shorts, and 5 inch heels. I still couldn't tell you what she was selling. We hustled past as soon as possible! Otherwise, it is a busy district, but no noise was audible in our room. There were plenty of restaurants, bars, pharmacies, and conbini near us. And no signs of this being a ""sex district."" My big negative for staying there was that the women and men had completely different bathing areas... women have to walk down a dark alley to a completely different building, where they are given an hour to do their business. Not to say the bathing/spa experience was negative, just that it wasn't in the building I was staying in. Additionally, I don't believe it was an onsen, as it was constantly referred to as a spa, nor did I see any paperwork on the onsen water quality anywhere. So this could be classified as a sento?","Strongsville, Ohio","jlhttravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Strongsville, Ohio</strong>",43,4.0

The choice is overwhelming which I loved!! And the food is superb! We are talking SUPERB and the prices are relatively cheap compare to ginza etc where the area is too touristy to my liking! The hotel is a boutique one, but the biggest in the area, the spa is really good! Although be prepared that in Japanese culture, people are naked in spas so this was a bit awkward for us Brits/EuropeansThe rooms are the size of a boat cabin, you are in Japan after all so just accept the fact that rooms are tiny! Once you accept this, you will realise that rooms at the centurion grand are bigger than others! With really good amenities, good natural toiletries, including facial toners, cleaning oils etc which adds to the boutique feel! The beds are very very comfortable, not the pillows are odd ""they put wooden beads inside Japanese pillows and although they do provide 2 extra firm""ish"" pillows, I was slightly disappointed as I'm allergic to feather so I had to stick to the beaded ones :/ do what I do, I always travel with a pillow packed in my luggage so I'm happy all the time. Breakfast is a bit odd but this is Japan and you gotta try the way they eat! And I have to admit, it might look odd but it's actually super tasty!

Good value if you are working or are going to spend no time in your room. Avoid the breakfast, better places (even open 24/7) down the block. Like many budget hotels in Tokyo, rooms are small and dark, mattresses are old and too soft, and bathrooms are tiny. I go to Japan a lot so this is not just the perspective of a first time gaijin. Staff is really good and helpful, rooms are immaculate and front desk is very helpful. Only negative is that the climate control in the rooms is a little quirky and hard to control- love some fresh air but my window would not open.

This is a hole in the wall, tiny place with horrible filthy purple carpet in the hallway and a tiny lobby packed with people's suitcases and even a couple of mistreated birds sitting there in a tiny cage. The word ""dump"" comes to mind. I've traveled for years to Japan, and am no stranger to the size difference of a room in Tokyo and a room in other countries. Tokyo hotel rooms are infamous for being small. But please, consider that these rooms are the smallest of the small. They literally have no place to keep our two medium suitcases. You have to move them out of the way every time you want to go into the bathroom. It's the single worst value hotel I've ever stayed in. For two nights stay, admittedly at high season, we paid over $900. This is complete nonsense. It's a Motel 6 that has figured out a way to game the TripAdvisor system somehow. Seriously, this is a terrible, terrible investment -- don't even consider it.We're looking forward to getting out of here and into a normal quality hotel in Kyoto.

Rice, miso soup, seaweed, boiled egg, braised potatoes & carrots, bread rolls w/ butter, poached salmon, chicken sausages. If you don't want to eat the same thing every morning, I suggest you buy some wonderful bakeries when you go shopping for the day, and keep bakeries for your next day breakfast.

We traveled as a couple in our 20s, who appreciate quiet and convenience. The hotel is located about 3mins from the subway and has tons of bars and restaurants in the area. There's also countless convenience stores around. The area was full of salary men after hours but was mostly calm and quiet. The lounge/lobby/restaurant/bar area with the reception had the nicest staff we've ever encountered. They were happy to help us out with directions and everytime it rained (and boy did it rain) they made sure we didn't leave the hotel without borrowing an umbrella. This is also the area where breakfast is served in the morning. The breakfast was solely catered to japanese clientele, with soy-dogs, miso-soup and rice, but they had managed to sneak in some bread, jam and butter onto the breakfast buffet. Thank you for that, although we, as western tourists, would have appreciated some boiled eggs, cheese and bacon. Overall the breakfast was average, but I did eat a whole lot of those soy-dogs. There's always complimentary coffee and soft drinks at the entrance. We stayed at a standard double room on the 9th (?) floor. The room was quiet and had a very comfortable bed. The bathroom had one of those fancy japanese toilets with a bidet and washer, which I had never tried before..I loved it! The bathtub and shower worked perfectly and you got a bunch of amenities including schampoo, conditioner, showergel, soap, facial cream, tooth rush, hairbrush and even more. The room had a fridge, a safe and a TV with japanese channels. There was also a built in universal charger for your phone or tablet. The free wi-fi was fast and stable. The only negative about our room was the lack of space. Most rooms in Tokyo are smallish but with that there should be some sort of smart storage-solution. Our suitcases covered most of the free space on the floor and this room could use a shelf or another cabinet hung on the wall. With the addition of this detail this would be an excellent hotel. So overall, a great stay, with great staff and free japanese breakfast.

We booked a twin room, but had an extra traveller when we showed up. Reception staff were really accommodating and made up an extra bed with no fuss. The included breakfast was absolute rubbish (for a westerner)...but there was a Starbucks close by. Oh...the ONE NEGATIVE about this hotel, was that they double charged us. We had one transaction amount on the day of our check in, then an additional charge about a week after our check out. We had to get this refunded from our bank...but the process was pretty pain free because the authorisation numbers didn't match.

The only plus was the location, with a reasonable choice of restaurants around. The room was small and with no space for the luggage (we had to use the window ledge and the small sofa to put the luggage). The sink was clogged from the start and we asked for it to be fixed, which they did, but after a few hours it was clogged again. The large window had no black out curtains and since it was facing east we were awaken by the sunlight every morning before six. We pointed out the problem to the staff but they were unable/unwilling to do anything about it. The heating was also not working properly. Basically the room was cold at night and terribly hot in the morning and it was impossible to regulate the temperature. The only way was to switch off the heating system completely and stay put under the blankets. They strictly impose a check out time at 11 am and since our flight was departing after 3 pm we asked whether they could accommodate a 12 noon check out, which is the normal check out time in most hotels in Tokyo. For a 12 noon check out time they were asking a surcharge of 10% of the room cost. After a lengthy discussion they gave in and allowed us to stay until 12 at no surcharge. It was nonetheless an unpleasant experience because they made it appear as a big concession.The deal breaker, however, was the breakfast. I can understand one can't expect much from a 'free' breakfast, but this was far too bad, starting form the location of the breakfast room, which was not a dedicated area but just the cramped little entrance of the hotel. The buffet table was literally one step away from the main door (see pictures). As a result, whenever somebody was entering or exiting the hotel, cold wind from the outside was invading the area. To make things worse, since the area was so small it could accommodate no more than 15 people at one time, it was imperative to have breakfast early enough lest one had to stand holding a tray until somebody finished. Even if you were lucky enough to secure a seat, you were then pressured to hurry up by the anxious stares of the standing guests waiting for a table. The breakfast food itself was plain horrible. Basically only 7eleven type sausages, cooked mackerel, raw eggs, industrial cereals and undrinkable coffee. To top it all up, there were only paper cups and plastic cutlery. I had to ask for metal cutlery to be able to eat the mackerel and make a special request for the raw eggs to be soft boiled. In fairness to the staff, the second day they remembered my requests and offered immediately metal cutlery and soft boiled egg. Yet this doesn't redeem this place to which we will never return and which I would not recommend.","Trieste, Italy","Gilo M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Trieste, Italy</strong>",190,2.0

Our taxi driver had some trouble finding the hotel but having stayed in Akasaka-mitsuke at the beginning of our trip, we could roughly guide him to where we wanted to go. On Booking.com, we had booked for two separates rooms and much to our dismay we were only given one for four people, which was kind of cramped. Seeing as it was the tail end of the trip, we needed a little bit more space so negotiated with the staff to have two separate rooms on a different floor. All was good until they told us they only had one bed in one room but would be bringing up a trundle bed for us. A bang in the corridor alerted us at 11pm that the bed was arriving. When we answered the door, a very flustered employee attempted to drag the portable bed into the room but it just was too large for the door frame. After much huffing and puffing, we got the bed in and the poor employee (now profusely sweating) came back to make the bed.It's pretty no frills accommodation but has aircon, a washing machine you can't understand, a dehumidifier and a little kitchenette. The bathroom is tiny as are most in Japan, so if you're the size of an average Westerner, it's going to be a tight squeeze.Centurion is close to transport and heaps of eateries though with Akasaka-mitsuke and Akasaka stations only a few minutes walk. If you're staying here, don't opt for the free breakfast at the cafe downstairs as a lot of the Western options are not really like they are at home i.e eggs but they do serve hot chips and who hasn't wanted hot chips for breakfast?","Melbourne, Australia","Emma L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",8,3.0

At this station, look for exit 10. When you come up from the station, head toward the quieter road. Turn left and walk to the road junction, then turn right at next junction, then turn left at next junction and walk towards hotel. All in, the walk from station to the hotel is about 3 minutes.The hotel room:Now the hotel itself – it is almost a boutique hotel. There were 3 of us and we got a room with a king bed and a separate single bed. The room is rather small, as is expected of Tokyo hotel. But it is clean and well equipped – with a large LED TV, dressing table, fridge, cupboard, kettle and humidifier. The toilet is compact with a bath-tub, and ample toiletries are provided. There is also a small cupboard, in-room safe box and writing table provided. The hotel does not face any major road, so it is generally quiet. Complimentary wi-fi is provided in the room.The breakfast:My room rate came with breakfast, which is provided at the café next to the lobby. It is a rather small area, with seating capacity of about 20 – some mornings are packed, and unless you are prepared to take away your breakfast, you may have to wait 5-10 minutes for the seats. Breakfast is provided buffet style – with nice soft buns, small sausages, potato salad, and some Japanese food including rice, miso soup, fried fish, dried seaweed and other condiments. There is also cereal with milk, juices and coffee and tea. Fruits seem to be those in syrup, not fresh fruits. While the breakfast is sufficient to start the day, the food is the same every day (I stayed there 7 days) and it gets boring after awhile.Hotel surrounding area:I felt safe walking around, even in the evenings. There are lots of eateries and small mini-marts nearby. It is located in a neighbourhood with small roads. By subway, Shinjuku is only 5 stations away and Tokyo station is only 4 stations away, so it is a good place to stay to explore Tokyo and beyond.","Singapore, Singapore","Ricky_SG</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",85,4.0

It never bothers me staying in this hotel, but if you are big, taller than 6'5, you may not fit in their bed, not to mention their super clean, yet duper small bathroom with extremely low ceiling.

We got a double and the bed was so comfy. The staff were very helpful an the hotel was very clean and quiet. I would make sure you know where your going after getting of the subway, we had no idea and proberly wouldnt have found it as its down side streets. We did have a very helpful japanese man take us to our hotel. Its a 3 min walk to the subway station which has many trains going through it so its easy to get yourself around Tokyo.

Why? 1) This centrally-located hotel, less than 5-minutes-walk from the Akasaka-Mitsuke Station (right below Bic Camera department store), is new and well-maintained. Everyone from reception to housekeeping was genuinely helpful, did their very best to communicate in English and did all they can to accommodate us. Shout out: a special thanks to one of the nice ladies at the front desk, Hasunuma, for embodying great Customer Service:)2) Our soundproof room, made tight with 2 twin beds and a sofa turned extra bed, was still fabulous due to the large picture windows facing the city view! Wi-Fi's free and actually works. Robes, slippers, indoor safe, free mineral water, etc. etc. Free breakfast buffet service from 6:30AM to 10AM. The relatively spacious bathroom (considering we are in the middle of Tokyo) was replete with toiletries and gadgets. This is the only country we've been where sudden laughter can be heard from the bathroom:) It's the heated toilet seat! Plus much much more:))) 3) There's a 24-hour supermarket by Akasaka Station, less than 10-minutes-walk away. You can't go hungry, since there's McDonalds, Ootoya, Lawsons, Family Mart, and so many other bars, eateries and restaurants in the area. Pachinko and karaoke, too.4) Two beautiful shrines, Hie-Shrine and the Toyokawa Inari, are easy walking distance and were well worth the visit.5) An early morning earthquake woke us!!! That was scary, but this hotel was built to withstand earthquakes. In spite of this hair-raising episode, we'd love to come back:)))",Philippines,"mzzyap</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philippines</strong>",898,5.0

It was close to the metro and the room is apparently bigger then some of the other hotels. The breakfast provided is sufficient as well, a great deal for the price. The staff is friendly and a chinese speaking stuff was there which was great as they don't communicate well in english, so that helps with the process. However they do have english instructions which are written clearly. I would return to the hotel the next time I'm at japan.

The hotel is brand new with small but well equipped and nicely decorated rooms with all amenities you need. Good quality bed and fast internet connection. The complimentary breakfast for all guests is a nice gesture. From the doorstep of the hotel there is a huge choice of restaurants and shops and it is very convenient located close to a train station. The staff is very friendly and helpful and although in the middle of a street there is no noise to be heard in the room, so sleeping is very peaceful. All details are taken care off including a common area where you can do your laundry at a small fee and get ice cubes to use for drinks in your room. It is a great hotel in a good area and I would highly recommend it for a couple of nights stay in Tokyo and I would return to this hotel without any hesitation during my next visit!","Renesse, The Netherlands","amvg2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Renesse, The Netherlands</strong>",129,5.0

They are comfortable, efficient, clean and quiet, but that is all they are. That is, there is nothing truly exciting or memorable about them. With its complimentary Japanese buffet breakfast, the Centurion is a really good value for Tokyo, or any city for that matter. It is a couple blocks from two major subway lines which will take you to Tokyo Station, Shibuya or Shinjuku in less than 15 minutes. There are also plenty of restaurant options in this rather quiet neighborhood.
