The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable with a good bed and a great balcony with a clear view of Diamond Head crater. The bathroom was clean and well stocked. The WiFi is good. The location is very good because it is far enough away from Waikiki and Honolulu to be peaceful, but just a short walk to both those places. We walked to Diamond Head crater from here to do the Diamond Head crater walk. We found the breakfast at Hau Tree Lanai to be quite expensive, so recommend a short walk along the foreshore towards Waikiki for any meal at Barefoot Beach Cafe. This became our favourite place to eat. The beach is 60 seconds away and Kapiolani Park is across the road. Fantastic location. It was also fun to get something to eat and a few beers from the ABC Store and sit on the balcony with Diamond Head as a companion. We will definitely be back.","Sydney, Australia","TrevorMP</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",27,5.0

I had one of the lower priced rooms as that was all I needed as a solo traveler (room 724), and below $200.00 a night, which is a relative bargain in this area. Although the hotel is not actually ""in"" Waikiki, it's an easy 20 minute or so walk to the center of it all. I love the location as it is never rushed, crowded or hurried, and their beach is never crowded and very nice. Clean room, high floor, with lanai and views of the water and Diamond head, if you looked out over the railing.The oceanfront rooms are a good deal ....the corner rooms with a view of Waikiki and the Pacific are the best deal if you can get one. Check out the website for more info.The Hau Tree restaurant is well known among the locals, but I prefer the Miyako Japanese restaurant on the 2nd floor - (ck at check-in for discounts!).If you really want to go ""budget style"", there is a well stocked convenience store on the property that has just about everything from papayas, sandwiches to alcohol, to every necessity you might need.I guess you can tell I like it here!Happy trails,conrad","Wilton, New York","Conrad4u</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wilton, New York</strong>",7,4.0

We were told that the deafening noise would start every morning at 8.30, but the only compensation we were offered were for them to waive the 20$ resort fee, which already seems steep as the hotel is not a resort but a regular hotel. The construction work also meant we couldn’t use the advertised outdoor patio dinner/drink area and made staying on the small beach in front of the hotel less than peaceful. On top of this, the room we were offered smelt of old cigarette smoke and a had a view of the parking lot. What made it all more aggravating was the receptionist’s attitude as the first thing she did when we, after trying to get some of compensation for the noise, asked if we could cancel, was to say - rather gloatingly - that we had already prepaid. Probably she was in a bad mood for having had to stand in the midst of a building site all day, but a bit of sympathy would have gone a long way.After some discussions, the hotel offered to waive the 200$ cancellation fee and we left and found a new hotel, the Pacific Monarch Hotel, where staff were beyond helpful and we had a lovely stay. Anyhow, after two days, we realised that the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel had still charged the cancellation fee, but when we called - first to hotel.com, who luckily had confirmed and recorded the hotel’s promise to cancel without a fee, and then to the hotel -they said no such fee had been drawn. More work and phone calls and they finally blamed a fault in their system for charging the fee to our card and promised to refund it within seven days. We have still to se if this happens. All in all this was a disappointing and slightly aggravating experience which we wasted hours of our Honolulu trip on. Had it not been for all this I reckon the hotel would have been pleasant enough though there would still have been a discrepancy between room, staff attitude, and price.","London, United Kingdom","Signe H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",6,3.0

In Oahu, we always stayed in Hilton Hawaiian Village (mostly staying an ocean front unit facing the ocean. Everything was ok but increasingly became tired of 'madness' around the Hilton (too many people in a rather small area, hard to get a desired unit, expensive if you want a good view, a lack of really good restaurants without paying a lot) we decided to try this boutique hotel at the opposite end of Waikiki. We had the ocean front/Waikiki unit that looked the Pacific Ocean and the entire Waikiki sky line. Yes the hotel is generally a bit old, but the room was nicely renovated and really really clean. The view from the unit was spectacular (the view after dark is special), far better than any view that we ever had in Hilton. Also the atmosphere of the hotel and surrounding were so calm and resting, you can breeze. Beach was small but not crowded compered to the rest of Waikiki beach. It is close to the Zoo and Aquarium (waking distance) and Diamond head park. Also the neighborhood was surrounded by multimillion dollar houses. There are two excellent restaurants, a Japanese restaurant and Haute Tree Lani restaurant, both of which serve excellent food. Also if you like busy, loud, and 'exciting' shops/night clubs and restaurants along Waikiki beach, you could walk less than a mile.to get there.

It started with our reservation made by Donna, our friendly servers, Allen who insisted on taking many photos of us with the setting sun as the background, and Andy who served us our first breakfast. It was all an absolute delight. The food was superb and so beautifully plated at every meal that we were served. The fading sunlight was replaced by flaming torches and a live guitar player sang and set the mood with wonderful Hawaiian music. The breeze off the ocean was perfect. The view of the deep blue Pacific and Waikiki beach from our balcony was priceless. Our room was perfectly made up each day by Jemma who always had a smile. Everyone from the front desk to the Valet attendants was helpful and gave us directions and suggestions whenever we asked. We highly recommend the Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel and their ""Hau Tree Lanai"" restaurant for a lovely experience whenever you visit Oahu Hawaii.

It was wonderful for us. Kaimana Beach is fantastic. Lovely white sand and clear water and not too crowded (even in the weekend). The Hau Tree Restaurant is special, particularly at sunset as it faces west over Kaimana Beach. We loved the little touches of flowers on the pillow at night. The only reason we give this a 4 star and not 5, is that the reception staff are neither as responsive nor as helpful as we have come to expect from our extensive travels.

It’s definitely worth the price to upgrade to a ocean front room. It’s worth to note that there are different levels of Ocean front rooms here-Ocean front deluxe (largest and best), Ocean front Waikiki deluxe, and Ocean superior. You can also get an Ocean Waikiki superior but that’s sort of a side view of the ocean and more noise from the beach. There’s a big difference in terms of the view-ranges from that you’re right there, just the ocean all around at 360 degree, to that you get a glimpse of the ocean and beach from an angle-depending on how important the view of the room is to you and how much you want to pay. The hotel has a wonderful onsite restaurant, Lau Tree Lanai which has both inside and outside seating as well as a bar that also serves small dishes. Reservation is recommended as it is also one of the most popular restaurants by the beach in Waikiki. Breakfast is served here but not included if you’re hotel guests. Overall the hotel’s decor and amenities are a little dated. The ocean rooms have good views but the courtyard leaves much to be desired. We are underwhelmed with Miyako restaurant on the second level, but highly recommend their Hau Tree Lanai. The famous beach is literally right there by the restaurant/hotel. What makes this our favorite hotel is definitely it’s fantastic location with unbeatable views. Located at the end of Waikiki strip you are within walking distance to where most actions are but still has a sense of peace/seclusion.

We splurged on an ocean front/corner room. The view was amazing. The moment we opened the door, and pulled back the curtains, we were in awe. The ocean out the front and the Waikiki skyline/ocean out the side, was breathtaking. The room was well appointed and nicely updated. The bed was comfortable, and the bedding and towels were good quality. The room had nice updates.I believe this is our fifth time to stay at this hotel....but, the first time to have such a nice room. It was well worth the extra cost.As others stated, it is about 1/2 of a mile walk through the park to get to the beginning of the Waikiki ""strip"". However, it is a pleasant walk and mostly shaded. The park did have a few homeless people, but they kept to themselves, and at no time did I feel insecure with their presence. The beach outside the hotel was nice. Seems to be a somewhat protected area, so wasn't real rough. A lot of locals use the beach, and it was great to see so many people surfboarding, kayaking, etc... The World War 1 monument next door is still in a state of disrepair, albeit, not the hotels fault. It would be a grand site, if the city/state would ever fix it up.We had room service from the Hau Tree restaurant on July 4th. The food was excellent, and we just enjoyed our meal on our balcony, watching the 4th of July fireworks over the ocean....a fantastic experience.We had drinks and appetizers at the Sunset Bar....the food and drinks were good.Our only complaints this trip:1) Our departing flight did not leave until 5:20 pm, so we asked for a late check out. The hotel staff said they could not accommodate, even though they confirmed there were various openings/availability for corner rooms that day. I politely reminded them I have patronized this hotel at least five times before and have spent tens of thousands of dollars here, this would be a nice ""value added"" service to allow a late check out for a returning guest/repeat customer....but, they said no. This is very disappointing. It also puts a hardship on me; we had to check out at noon....so, for five hours we had nothing to do....we don't want to jump in the ocean, or walk far, working up a sweat before we get on a plane...as our room was not available in which to shower or change. This really sucks...and the New Otani needs to review this policy. AGAIN, I AM A RETURN GUEST THAT HAS SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY HERE.2) Review your statement closely. I had prepaid the room months ago, to get the best rate....yet they still presented me a bill of over $400.00 additional charges. Some were expected, room service and lounge charges. But, the resort tax was not prepaid. And, the hotel also charged me for parking the car for every night...even though we only had a car for one night. The front desk made the change after I pointed out the error. Lastly, note they charge a resort fee. This is not a resort. There is not a pool....there are no cabanas. They do not serve their patrons outside, or bring them drinks, while lounging at the ocean, etc... This is a gotcha fee....plain and simple. They state the resort fee covers: wi-fi, free local calls and beach towel....come on.....every hotel covers these things.",Dallas,"jvmaddux</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas</strong>",164,4.0

I have never been more pleasantly surprised in my life! When I made the reservations for our group we requested ocean view rooms, the rooms had gorgeous views of the ocean and Waikiki Beach. This hotel turns out to be a diamond on a diamond in that it is located on the other side of a park from the busy hustle and bussell of Waikiki beach yet just a short walk away, handy to the Aquaium and the Honolulu Zoo. Much to our surprise after checking out and back in a week later after our cruise, our whole group was upgraded to suites with all exterior walls being glass from floor to ceiling offering phenomenal views of the Ocean, Beach, Ft DeRussey Park, and Waikiki all at no additional charge. The service at the hotel was exceptional with very friendly staff sincerely interested in making our stay comfortable and a joyful experience. The hotel has a bar in the lobby area with nominal prices. The Lobby is open air to the street and the beach sporting a comfortable sea breeze most of the time. There is a restaurant down from the first floor offering a spectacular menu for Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. For the connoisseur of great Japanese dishes there is a five star restaurant on the second floor, Myaki's offering the best Japanese cuisine. If I have the good fortune to ever go back to Honolulu, regardless the purpose of my visit, this is where I will stay.

What is the best value. The worst room in a luxury world class hotel like the Royal Hawaiian, or the best room in an average hotel? After reading hundreds of trip advisor reviews we chose the latter. If you can possibly afford it book a de luxe corner room on a high floor. We had room 810 and it was spacious, well furnished and comfortable. But when we opened the curtains the views were jaw dropping. From one end of the room we looked over Diamond Head. and from the long side glassed wall we had gob smacking views over Waikikki.In 40 years of travel the views across to the Royal Hawaiian and the strip were the best we have seen. It was a delight to sit on the balcony and watch the amazing sunsets.Now, one error we made was underestimating the distance to the action which centred around the area of the Royal Hawaiian. Yes, if you are young and super fit it may be possible to walk the distance, but for a couple of seniors with joint replacements it was out of the question. If you ask reception how to get the bus they tell you to get a 19 or 20 'just out the front'. It is not out the front.If you walk to the left it is 500 metres to the stop but if you walk to the right it is only 300 meters. Time by bus to the centre of the action is 15 minutes, that is if the driver doesn't stop for a rest break. Remember this is Hawaii. On half of our bus trips the driver stopped at a park and announced he was taking his 15 minute break. No one seems to worry while the driver wanders off and returns in 15 minutes.There is still a further catch. Because of the one way streets and chaotic traffic you may not always get the bus back to the hotel from the same street. You will have to figure out on what street the stop will be located, and where the stop is on that long street. Not a lot of fun in the heat and humidity.Now here is my point. The reception staff book you in and check you out. Any further requests will make them stare like a deer caught in the headlights. A simple request for a sheet of copy paper brought a stare of amazement. And how hard would it be for them to open a map and mark the bus stops for first time visitors? But that's not their job description.We dined one evening at the Hau Tree Restaurant and it was wonderful, but with our Aussie dollar languishing at 68 cents it cost a kings ransom (Please President Trump no more tweets or it will be 60 cents). We did find that the Bar had small portion meals that were very good, and by sheer chance found that if you walk along the path by the shore you come to a wonderful beach restaurant which we highly recommend.We recommend the area as being quiet and the beach right outside the hotel perfect. It was a delight to see families enjoying the surrounding park and the beautiful blue water.Do not walk the parks at night as homelessness is always in your face. One guy was aggressive and spat on us when we refused a request for money.For the rest of the world that live in a non tipping culture do be aware that right through the U.S gratuities are expected for any service from the house keeping staff right down and it is rising to 20 per cent. Just do it.Would we stay at this hotel again? Yes if we could be certain of having the same room, but no if it was not available. We think we would need to find something closer to the centre of Waikikki.PS why don't they have a shuttle bus?

We were on an upper floor with a balcony and had a great view both day and night. Parking can be difficult and valet parking is expensive ($34.00/day if I recall). We paid for valet parking our first day but then utilized on-street parking for the remaining 3 days. It's meter parking during the day (2 hours max) but after 6 pm it's free.

The beach in front of the hotel is very good and not to crowded like many other places on Waikiki Beach. It is far enough away from the ""madness"" of Waikiki Beach to be quiet, but still only a short walk away. Took about 10 minutes to walk either through the park or following the road. I do recommend following the road to avoid homless people during night which is a Waikiki problem.Both the breakfast and dinner at the hotel was excellent. Usually not a problem to get a table, but to be sure i recommend a reservation for dinner atleast during weekends. When it comes to parking it is expensive at the hotel, but it is free parking in the street outside daytime hours. So if you rent a car and plan to drive between 10:00 - 17:00 it is free the rest of the time, and a max of two hour parking during those payable hours.We had a beach view deluxe room and it was awesome, tho pricy. The ordinary beach view rooms are disapointingly small and i was quite disapointed when seeing it. Hardly room for luggage and small bed. Normal rooms with no view are a bit better when it comes to space. Consider hardly whats important for you when it comes to room before ordering here. The balcony at the Ocean front deluxe rooms were spacious and private with both sunbed and chair/table.Clean, comfterable, polite staff and good location maked it worth it for me, however at a high price to get a good room.","Oslo, Norway","Anders80</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oslo, Norway</strong>",48,4.0

Can't really see the sunrise from the beach here, and the view from my room was mostly of buildings but if i looked to the left I could see the mountains and even saw a turtle swimming in the ocean in the slit of the ocean view I had!

The New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel has a really cool ocean front location near the base of Diamond Head. If you are looking for peace and quite and being away from the hustle and bustle of central Waikiki then this might be the place for you. It is really quiet down here and everything shuts down very early and there isn't much nearby. For some this is a plus.  The beach is very good and rivals any portion of Waikiki Beach. It is not crowded and it is good for swimming, not many waves, and appears safe for all ages. Access to the beach from the hotel is a little funky in my opinion but not something to stop someone from staying here. The New Otani Kaimana doesn't have a pool but its beach location makes up for that. The building is an older Mid-Century building which some may like but it is not architecturally significant and most of the common areas are very ""dated."" Not much if anything has been changed in the common atrium area for decades. The common lobby is commensurate for the size of the hotel. The Hau Tree Lanai is definitely a cool spot for breakfast, lunch, or a drink or two. Service is adequate but not exceptional. While the common areas are dated our ocean front corner room had been updated. It was adequate but not top of the line. The photos on TripAdvisor were a fair representation. Our corner room was just slightly on the smaller size but two full walls of glass with awesome views in each direction more than made up for any size issue. In addition, our lanai was substantially larger than what you will find at just about any place you might stay at regardless of the price. The views from the ocean front rooms and ocean front corner rooms at the New Otani will rival anything you will find in other areas of Waikiki. I would recommend trying to be at least on the 4th floor or higher since the palm trees may block some of your park/Waikiki view. All of that being said I would only recommend this place if you are going to stay in an ocean front room or ocean front corner room and if you are okay with the slower pace and quiet aspects of this hotel. However, I would not recommend this place if you are going to stay in one of the rooms designated as economy, standard, or Diamond Head.","Livermore, California","Alayy242</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Livermore, California</strong>",11,4.0

Maintenance was quick to respond with the couple of issues I had as well.Now, onto the accommodations. I had a room with 2 twin sized beds - not something I've ever experienced outside of Hawaii. I did have a balcony, but it was overlooking the parking lot. The carpet was quite frayed in many places and appeared in need of a deep cleaning. But the twin sized beds were comfortable (I slept in each one) and the bedding was clean.The bathroom is small, but has what you need. My shower was very slow to drain, but maintenance addressed that problem quickly. My biggest complaint about the bathroom is that the shower head in my room was handheld. When it was resting on the wall so both my hands could be free, the shower was hitting the shower curtain directly. I tried many times to angle it away from the shower curtain, but nothing seemed to work. As a result, there was a SIGNIFICANT amount of water all over the bathroom floor after each of my showers.From inside the hotel, access to the beach is a little awkward. However, the beach is nice and has a life guard. You can get beach towels from the lobby, which is great.This is a much quieter end of Waikiki Beach and is close to Diamond Head so that may be a plus for some people.For the price paid, I would return.

I would say that locals recommend the hotel above all others in Waikiki because of its moderate prices, its location ""at the quiet end of Waikiki"" -- and because it embodies the laid-back, open-air style of island life. But, if you need the clubs and fine dining choices that Waikiki offers, they're just a 10-minute walk west along the scenic beach promenade along adjacent Kapiolani Park. This venerable park, given to the City of Honolulu by King Kalakaua in 1888 to remember his queen, surrounds the hotel with wide open lawns, tall swaying coconut trees, shady banyan trees, flowering shower trees etc. To its credit, the Japanese-owned hotel has NOT been tarted up, or streamlined, or otherwise fussed over. Nothing trendy here! It's pure old-style, no-need modesty in a perfect setting. The clean rooms are smallish and reasonably priced -- and who spends time in their hotel room in Hawaii, anyway? The beach and park beckon, all day and moon-lit night. Just about every room has a great ocean or park/Diamond Head view. Service is low-key and friendly, island style. The open-air lobby bar must be one of the most glamorous rendezvous spots in Waikiki. The famous beach-front Hau Tree Lanai restaurant is expensive but worth it for its views of Waikiki and Honolulu, for its timeless menu, table-settings and service, and for its legendary hau-tree canopy, under which, they say, Robert Louis Stevenson once lolled. A breakfast, lunch or dinner there is a memorable experience. Last tip: parking on site is expensive, but there's lots of free and metered public parking all around the park. No nerve-wracking parking garages! Driving, getting anywhere else on the island, is generally much easier from the Kaimana than from congested central Waikiki with its crazy one-way streets.

The inner courtyard of the upper floors is very plain and nothing to look at but it doesn't affect the comfort of the room or the overall stay. I was very impressed with the room, not deep at all but wide which is a little unusual but works with a small footprint. We had an upgraded room on the 8th floor facing Waikiki and the entire outer wall was windows. It had a balcony with a small table and a couple of chairs and provided incredible views of the entire expanse of Waikiki, the ocean and part of the inland hills, which is something you cannot get FROM Waikiki beach. We were able to get late reservations for dinner at the restaurant downstairs and everything was wonderful. Dining was outside and under trees and torch lighting, with sounds of the waves, views of the beach and views of fireworks on the other side of Waikiki (which occurs every Friday night).

We were on our anniversary trip, which we told them ahead of our arrival. We didn't even get a ""congratulations"" at the front desk! Nothing! We requested a queen bed and got two singles moved together with a hard edge through the middle. The view to Diamond Head and the mountains was nice as long as you didn't stand up, since below the beauty was the ugliest hotel roof with AC units and a car park. I guess you can enjoy it sitting down. The price seemed too high for what you get. The 14 dollar per night ""resort fee"" is ridiculous since this is a simple hotel with no resort facilities, no pool etc. Apparently the coffee machine with fake powder creamer provided is part of the resort fee. It's cheaper to go out for coffee! The bed was a bit hard, so we slept on top of the comforter (which you won't need unless you sleep with super high AC on). It does get very stuffy in the room without the AC, since you can't really leave the balcony door open at night due to security issues (stated in the room info pack) and a lack of bug screens. The pillows are super small and very lumpy but have standard pillow cases on them, which get all tangled and messy during sleep. I was hoping for a decent sleep before travel back home, which we didn't get. The bathroom is well stocked and has a good shower. The maid was friendly but the bellhop was a bit too pushy for my taste. Breakfast was not included but is available for a whopping $30 Us dollars, which is ridiculous considering you can find it everywhere for $10 bucks or less.

We checked in, and then walked towards Waikiki for dinner and dessert. We walked back and watched the Hilton fireworks from the Queens Beach pier on a Friday night. This was a nice night for us in Waikiki - not to overwhelming. The television was a bit far from the bed making it more difficult to see. The shower was fantastic temperature and water pressure. The bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows. Everything was clean. My husband did not like that there was not a fan in the bathroom, and that the door to the bathroom was a vented door...but then again, you can open the balcony up for fresh air. I do wish that there was a screen on the balcony...it wasn't so much that we thought bugs would be a problem, but more the overly friendly birds.There is no pool, but the beach is nice. It has a lifeguard on duty during the day. Also, a shower for washing off before going inside. The snorkeling was not fantastic for us at 6:00 am on a Saturday in May. While we had the beach almost to ourselves, the visibility was not good. There were fish though...just hard to see due to visibility. Did not see a lot of coral. At a total of $300 on a Friday night in May (with parking and resort fee), we had a $50 food credit which we used for breakfast...note, for two persons, the $50 credit didn't quite cover it.Overall, we don't normally spend this much on a hotel - but I suppose that is just the cost of Waikiki. It was a very nice stay...but just a bit much for our budget. I liked being on the ""quiet"" side of Waikiki away from the touristy/shopping area. There were still plenty of surfers/SUPers to watch.

We could hear constant noise anytime the elevator was in use (through the thin walls). When we told them that we needed a room that we could sleep in, they said they didn’t have any available. They managed to find a suite upgrade for us at an additional half of the cost we were already paying. We were staying for three nights, it took us way over budget, but we would not have been able to sleep in the room that they provided.Same experience at the restaurant downstairs. We were scolded for not having a reservation. We made a reservation for 2 hours later. When we arrived they had a table in the back corner that was available. But otherwise, our reservation didn’t amount to anything. We tried to wait for a better table, but after a half an hour, we decided we were hungry enough to take the table. Our waiter was phenomenal. He was very attentive, and we enjoyed talking with him. He was the best thing about this hotel.We were given tips for parking on the street, but there are so many rules about when and where to park, that we decided to pay the $30 a night parking. The valet service was also exceptional.Rundown hotel, with a lot of little hidden upgrades that are required to make it enjoyable.If you don’t have a car, and don’t mind the room or sleeping, this would be perfect.

The staff were generally very helpful and quite old fashioned in their approach.A few key things to note:The in house restaurant has a bit of a following and can get busy - to be honest it must be because of the al fresco outlook and delightful setting because the service and the food is pretty average.

There is a bar in the open air style lobby with a view over the sea and beautiful sunsets.While less expensive than the central Waikiki hotels rooms are available from a bit over 200 USD. There are taxes and fees adding around 50 USD to this.

On-site parking is limited and is provided by valet only – for an extra daily fee ($32).The hotel is located right on the beach; it provides beach towels and mats. There’s a nice restaurant on site with beach-side outdoor seating. There’s also an enclosed traditional Japanese restaurant on the second floor fronting the ocean.

Staff were great, I didn’t eat at either of the restaurants, however they were full each time I walked through so I’m assuming they were good. The New Otani Kaimana isn’t a five star hotel so if you’re looking for a big hotel with lots of frills and amenities this isn’t the place for you, however if you’re looking for more of a boutique hotel that has a great beach front location, right next to the park at the Diamond Head end of Waikiki (which does mean its a 10 to 15 minute walk into the main drag) which feels a little like what it must have felt like staying in a quieter Waikiki 30 years back then this is the place for you.

When we arrived, we were told such a room was not available. My wife has problems sleeping and gets up a lot, waking me up if we're in the same bed. It was uncomfortable but since we had no choice, took the room with a bed and got a roll away bed as well. It was manageable but tight, and the next night a room we wanted opened up. But this did not start things off on a good note.Came here wanting a more reasonably priced alternative to the Outrigger and other hotels down in the denser tourist area of Waikiki, and it was a little less expensive but in the end, I will pay more in the future rather than putting up with this kind of service and lack of communication.This colored our view of the place, which had good points like the open air lobby, nice location, quieter than being in the busy Waikiki area, and we enjoyed breakfasts (not free) in the downstairs restaurant sitting by the beach, and had a nice time at the upstairs bar once having a second dinner there which was good.The room was okay, nice and simple, but the common area corridors were pretty run-down. Overall, if we forgot about the initial room error experience, it would have been a decent value for what we paid.

This is a perfectly fine hotel. I have no real complaints but a few very minor “dislikes” (none of which would keep me from coming back). The rooms are on the smallish side (compared to most modern hotels) but are clean and spacious enough for a single person or couple. I wasn’t in the room much except for sleeping anyway (this is Hawaii after all). I’m not a big fan of the louvered doors on the bathrooms though. I really like the individual wall-mounted A/C unit in each room to get the temperature just to your liking, but it was hard to find the exact vane position where it didn’t blow directly on some part of the bed (note to staff: clean the vanes of the A/C units periodically). Each room has a small balcony with chairs and table. The rest of the hotel was very clean, bright, and airy. The restaurant and bar are good but a little pricey (but on par with other places in this area) and all the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is right on the beach (although my room overlooked the neighboring parking lot and buildings but at the right angle I had a great view of Diamond Head). The beach is right out front and the resort fee includes the use of beach towels, mats, etc. with all sorts of additional recreational water gear that you can rent. Perhaps the biggest drawback, or asset depending on how you see it, is the distance from other restaurants and shops. It’s about a 15 minute walk to the edge of the main part of Waikiki which made it a little inconvenient to pop out someplace other than the hotel to get something to eat but also was nice that you are away from the hubbub of the city. The Barefoot Beach Café’ is a little closer and the breakfasts that I had there were great.

Lots of free tennis courts nearby and backs onto Kapuolani Park.

We really value good customer service and supporting smaller, local hotels. We know it’s a hard job so we try to be as understanding as possible. This review covers our five days/four nights at the New Otani. We were there from Saturday 12/30/17 until Thursday 01/04/18.Bellman:My boyfriend and I spent the month at Sans Souci next door and wanted to check into this hotel for the last leg of our trip. Since we are planning to spend future winters in Hawaii, we especially wanted to make sure this hotel would be a good one to recommend to friends while they visit us. It shares a parking lot with Sans Souci so it seemed like the perfect choice.We called New Otani to see if a bellman could help us move our luggage from our condo to the hotel. They were used to this request and Chris (our bellman) came up to our condo, loaded our luggage, and took it to our hotel room. Chris is amazing! He is so friendly and really made us laugh. He made a great impression and definitely set the hotel up for success, in terms of our experience. Check in:We walked over to check into the hotel, only to immediately encounter a rude interaction with the front desk receptionist, Aki. Perhaps it was the language barrier, but she was very condescending. She also paused in the middle of checking us in in order to enthusiastically help another guest. We took note of her name and decided to just go to our room to unwind. Americano run:Once we got to our room, my boyfriend started getting a caffeine headache. He requested I get him an Americano from the bar while he gets some work done. No problem, so I went downstairs to the hotel bar + restaurant to get him an Americano. The espresso machine was behind the bar so, naturally, I went to the bar. What I did not expect was the bartender to look at me like I was barged into her room as soon as I stepped foot into the restaurant. The look was seriously a cross of “what TF do you want” and “you don’t belong here.” There were 3 people at the bar—2 European women, 1 European man. Yet she made me feel like a pariah. I later learned her name is Lori. Nevertheless, I politely asked her for an Americano. I had my hand on the bar chair to pull it out and sit down while I waited for my beverage. Before I could move it, she aggressively told me that I could take a seat at the table and a waiter would help me. She then rolled her eyes and began to ask the woman seated closest to me if she needed anything. Ooookay. The waiter witnessed all of this yet he didn’t say or do anything. I go to a table a couple of feet away from the bar and look up at the waiter. We make eye contact and he looks away to look at the bartender. They share a look and a few words. He looks back at me and again looks away. After a minute (it felt much longer) he finally comes over. He hands me a menu and asks what I would like. I order the Americano and the check. At this point, I felt so hurt and humiliated. I was treated like rift raft meanwhile witnessing other patrons receiving good service. I asked myself if it was my clothes—shorts & a tank top—but it’s a beach front hotel in Hawaii, everyone is dressed similarly. The only thing that separated me from the people at the bar is the color of my skin. The waiter came back with the Americano and the bill. I asked him if I could take it up to my room, signed off on the bill, and left. For the first time in my life, I did not tip. Aftermath:I went up to my hotel room and felt like crying. I’m not a sensitive woman, but I haven’t had an interaction like that in a long time. Especially not in a establishment that we were spending quite a bit of money on during peak season. My boyfriend could tell I was upset and after a few moments, I told him what happened. He immediately recognized her behavior as wildly inappropriate. He went downstairs to talk to a manager. He was met with what could only be described as incompetence. No managers available and a promise to pass along his message for a chat with the dining manager, Ted. That would have to do for now. He came back upstairs, I took a shower, and we went on with our day.Bedtime:We were determined to try to make the best of the day (and the rest of our stay). The lanai in our ocean view room was beautiful. We loved looking at the water while chatting and enjoying each other’s company. As we were getting ready for bed, I playfully fell backwards onto the bed with a huge yawn. As soon as I opened my eyes, I saw more than 100+ bugs flying along the ceiling. Shocked, I began to look around and noticed they were all along the walls, in my cup of water, in the bed sheets, and pillows. Horrified, I jumped out of bed and got my boyfriend’s attention. I pointed out the bugs and began to feel itchy. He called the front desk. Apparently they were having a gnat infestation and did not bother to tell us upon check in. Not once did they apologize. Instead they tried to make it seem like it was our fault for using the lanai. Luckily, they sent over housekeeping and they vacuumed up a good chunk of the gnats. Falling asleep after that was very difficult and I shudder to think what else we would have found if we had a black light.Ted:My boyfriend and I continued our stay, although every hotel was booked so we didn’t have much of a choice. Upon returning from lunch, my boyfriend went up to the desk and asked to speak to Ted. Ted was within earshot to he turned and said, “yeah, I’m Ted.” We introduced ourselves and asked if he received our message from the day before. He did not. I’m not quite sure how to describe Ted, but he is a much older man. During the conversation he had a blank look on his face. Quite frankly, he doesn’t know what is going on and doesn’t seem all there. His speech was very slow and he seemed confused. It appears that his employees take advantage of that. He left to speak to Lori. He came back and stated that she “doesn’t recall” that interaction and that there was a misunderstanding. My boyfriend tells him that’s not an acceptable answer, especially because the situation was pretty straight forward. Again, Ted says it was a misunderstanding. My boyfriend repeats that he will not accept that as a valid excuse then asks for the general managers name. Finally Ted apologizes “on behalf of Lori.” We asked for the general managers name again. Ted tells us his name is “Mr. Celebrate.” Huh? Ted tells us he’ll be back on Tuesday. My boyfriend tells Ted our room number and asks him to set up a meeting with the four of us. We go back to our room and I tell my boyfriend that I’m pretty sure the GM’s name is Jean-Pierre. I read it somewhere but wasn’t completely sure. We look up his name & it’s Jean-Pierre Cercillieux. Either Ted didn’t know his manager’s name or he gave us a fake name. I’m leaning towards he didn’t know his name or how to pronounce it. I hate to say it but incompetence has become a trend here with the staff. The exceptions being the bellmen, valets, and the housekeeping staff. They were and continued to be amazing and kind—were the highlight of our stay.Ted failed to set up a meeting with Jean-Pierre and I suspect he never even tried to set up a meeting. He and my boyfriend played phone tag with Ted. Ted left us a message Tuesday afternoon while we were out, my boyfriend returned the message the following morning. Ted was not there when we checked out on Thursday.Gnats Attack:Our room got progressively worse with the gnats. We no longer left water cups by our bed, and had a nightly “ritual” of having someone come up to vacuum as many gnats as they could with a handheld vacuum. We often laughed and joked with them as they vacuumed the gnats. We thanked them profusely every night and tipped them for their time (as we should). By Wednesday, the gnats became out of control. I attached photos of them in a corner above the bed. That night Jonathan was helping up and he stopped vacuuming a quarter of the way through. He said there were way too many gnats and suggested we ask the front desk to move us. He saw the gnats all over the bed and in the sheets. He was so sweet and was very concerned. I called the front desk and told the male on the phone that Jonathan suggested we changed rooms. He responded with “oh okay. I’ll take a look at the rooms available.” I should mention that we had to call them every night so the gnats would get vacuumed and not once did we receive an apology from the front desk. The only ones that showed pride in the hotel & genuinely felt bad were the men that came up to vacuum the gnats. Thank you, gentlemen, we appreciate you. Oh and shout out to Gemma for being our housekeeper and doing a fantastic job with our room everyday. My mom is a custodian, it’s not an easy job. We appreciate you!New room:Jonathan took care of the entire room change and came back up to our room with keycards. We couldn’t help but think that THAT is how a manager should respond. He saved the evening. He showed my boyfriend the room while I packed my suitcases back up. Jonathan got us an ocean view suite with an 180° view of the ocean. Honestly, I wish we could have enjoyed it more but this was the worst hotel experience of our life. During the walk down to see the new room, Jonathan asked my boyfriend about our stay. He is the first person in the hotel that asked either one of us that question. My boyfriend was honest with him about our experience. Jonathan felt really bad and we could tell he really wanted to redeem it for us. Unfortunately it was our last night and a little too late. Huge thank you to Jonathan for trying to salvage the trip for us. The view was beautiful. We speculated about what our experience would have been like if we spent every night in this suite instead. Honestly, the room was spacious and the view was spectacular. However the sink was somehow cracked and resealed, the paint was chipping, and there were weird, dirty smudge marks all over the walls. Also the bathroom was painted blue while the room was green. For a hotel that was recently remodeled, it seemed a little run down with seemingly new furniture.There were still gnats in the suite due to the infestation but it wasn’t as bad as our previous room. We went to sleep knowing this nightmare was almost over. Checking out:Chris helped us with our luggage again. He brightened up our morning with his positivity. Both he and Jonathan should be promoted—they are the only ones that actually care about the hotel and the guests. Checking out was relatively painless. Not a single apology was offered over the hostility we encountered nor the gnat infestation. I looked over the bill while my boyfriend called the Lyft. Chris and the valet loaded our luggage into the Lyft and cheerfully sent us on our way, wishing us safe travels. We let out a huge sigh of relief as our Lyft driver drove us away. We survived.P.S. Avoid the restaurant. The servers are nice but aren’t well trained. They don’t know anything about their wine list. The bottle red we got was barely drinkable (even with a decanter).The mushrooms in the mushroom soup were undercooked; I only took two bites, my boyfriend was starving so he took it down. We had to go to another restaurant nearby after we paid for the meal because we were still hungry & didn’t trust anything on the menu. New Otani, unfortunately Sans Souci shares a parking lot with you so we’ll be seeing you again next year. However, in the future, we will not make the mistake of dining or staying with you.",,Mia M,17,1.0

We also enjoyed happy hour at the bar with appetizers. A daily resort fee was added to the price of the room which included use of beach towels, internet and daily newspaper. The hotel sits on a quiet beach near the Diamond Head district. There is a pleasant park nearby for evening strolls. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here.

It's not opulent or fancy, but more than adequate. All the staff were very friendly & professional. I paid 70.00 more a night when I got there (over my hotels.com) for an ocean view room & it was great. The 15 minute walk to downtown is though an interesting park that is quite a pleasant stroll.

The best is its not in downtown crazy Waikiki, but its about a 7 minute walk to it. There is a lovely park across the street and you can stroll up to Waikiki so easy. Don't need a car here and its expensive to park it here. I'd stay here again for sure but without a car next time. The food in the restaurants was good, nothing to write home about, but good and the view, well, you can't ask for better. The hotel was super clean and the bar downstairs facing the ocean was good.

As a Hawaii residents for more than 50 years now living on Maui, the Kaimana Beach Hotel is where we stay whenever we return to Oahu for a visit.

It's a nice walk along the parkway where you will see lots of birds and those crazy Banyan tree's which I found amazing. Yes there are some homeless people in the park at times but they did not bother us and at no time, day or night, did we feel unsafe while walking to or from Waikiki.The hotel does not have a swimming pool nor does it need one - it has the Pacific Ocean on its doorstep and the hotel will give you sand chairs, beach mats and towels to use.There is a small convenience store beside the hotel and it's a little more expensive than the shops in Waikiki which in turn are probably a lot more expensive than the shops at home... wherever home is!.I don't think we will ever return to Hawaii; 1) it's expensive, 2) it's too far from Scotland and 3) there are nicer places in the world to have a holiday.

The beachfront restaurant is ideally situated with two old beautiful trees for shade and ambience, the food here is very good as is the Japanese restaurant on the 1st floor. The beer was always nice and cold in the bar and restaurants .Staff in all areas of the hotel are exceptional, some having been here for many years.The hotel is around a 10 min easy walk depending on your fitness level to the mosh-pit of Waikiki and its many homeless people ( another reason to stay in Diamond Head ).I would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this hotel and will be definetely staying here on any return trip to Hawaii.","Coffs Harbour, Australia","indigo32</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coffs Harbour, Australia</strong>",54,5.0

The room we had, on the 6th floor,looked back across the water to Waikiki and the other, bigger, newer hotels.Fabulous view: from our balcony we watched the fireworks over the beach (sent up from the Hilton) one night, and rather than pay the exorbitant prices for a beach side restaurant, we got food to go from a nice Greek Restaurant (The Fat Greek https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60982-d949998-Reviews-The_Fat_Greek-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html ), and ate it on the balcony. No one had a better view than we did. And the hotel staff was very nice about providing the silverware, cloth napkins etc. to do it with.That's because there are quite nice restaurants on site. We did not eat at the Japanese one, but the Hau Tree Lani on the first floor is right on the beach and did well for both breakfast and lunch.The beach is immediately outside, and is uncrowded and great for swimming. It has a sandy bottom, is shallow/gradual in its depth, and has iifeguard. The hotel provides you towels and beach mats.My only negative comment is the quirky design of the bathroom. They could have used the same space much more efficiently and provided more room. On the other hand, you do get the fancy-schmancy Toto Japanese toilets which provide some amusement as you play with the various controls...It is about a 15 minute walk down into Waikiki, but there is a very nice pathway along the beach, so we never felt out of it.

We had the ocean view room, which is extremely small, basically a room with 3-4 feet around the bed, and a bathroom. Ok for 3 nights, but not much longer. The view (westward) was good of the beach & sunset. Room was very clean.At check-in, we asked where the pool was, they told us that the ""pool"" was the ocean. Yes, it was a beautiful beach, which is great for nice walks and swimming. However, I'm not a fan of sand in my shorts (and everywhere else). I simply assumed that a pool is an ""automatic"" for a resort/hotel at the beach. I have since gone back to the hotel's website and see no mention of ""no pool"". We were offered mats, towels and beach chairs (not loungers). We did that for a couple hours, but simply weren't comfortable. Fortunately, we had 2 full days planned of sightseeing around the island, so had little time available to spend at the hotel. If this were planned to be a vacation to relax in the sun, we would have checked out and gone to a hotel with a pool.Highlights: 1) The breakfast was really good, our table was outside on the patio viewing the beach. 2) The bar service inside was very good.

The Hau Tree restaurant on the premises has excellent food, service and a view at sunset that can't be beat.

It is also easy to take trips around the island avoiding the more congested routes by getting out through the back roads of Kaimuki or Kahala and enjoying days traveling to the various beautiful spots (beaches, hiking, gardens, museums, and scenic spots like the Pali) on the less crowded parts of Oahu that we have enjoyed over the years - and are always curious to see whether and how they have changed - or not! The hotel's restaurant is quite expensive, but one can eat out by going to the cafe at Queen's Surf for traditional ""hapa-haole"" mixtures of local and tourist oriented dishes, and can always drive to Kaimuki and Kahala and beyond for a wider range of both local and other more sophisticated fusion and specialty menus - as desired. A breakfast or brunch under the hau tree at the New Otani is relaxing and has not changed that much - still a nice reminder of how the earlier experiences in Honolulu could be quite a few decades ago.....and the swimming from the beach is great, watching ships coming into the harbor is relaxing also, and the sunsets from the ocean-view rooms of the hotel are spectacular!

We were in New Zealand at this point, and had stayed in quite a few hotels in the past few weeks on an extended trip. We were unable to get an upgrade via the agent after several days trying, and finally got confirmation from him that there was no upgrade as we arrived from New Zealand at the hotel desk at 9:00 am. The reception staff were not at all helpful, firstly telling me the hotel was full, then that we would have to wait until 2:00 p.m. for our room, and only reluctantly giving me WiFi access to check my latest email regarding upgrades. I insisted on getting the room number we would be given, and this was at first refused as well. We decided to have breakfast and check again afterwards.The restaurant is lovely, right on the beach, good food, just as advertised. The bill came with a schedule attached, advising what tips should be given for service. (Having never seen anything like this I photographed it). There was some confusion with the waiter as to which room to bill the breakfast to. He wouldn't bill it to the room number I had been given.When I went back to reception, I was told there was now unexpectedly a bigger room available for our 7 day stay, and we could choose whether to take it, or keep the ""moderate"" room, as soon as they had both been serviced. So off we went to kill some time until we could see the rooms.Comparing notes with my travel companion, he had been told the upgrade cost would be $60 per night, whereas I had been quoted $146 plus tax.When we were eventually shown the two options, the ""moderate"" room we were shown was not the room we were assigned earlier, which wasn't explained. As expected it was very small for two single people, and we felt it would be too cramped for a whole week. The bigger room was ideal for size, and came with an ocean view and large balcony.Enquiring about the price we were told it was the only bigger room available, and the price was non negotiable. The staff denied they had quoted $60 per night to one of us, and insisted on the $146 plus tax. I'm afraid by this time I felt we had been manipulated into taking the most expensive option, but of course, I can't prove that.Although the room and the view were lovely, and we liked the location at the quiet end of Waikiki, the treatment from staff at reception was a constant disappointment. Another example, not the only one, on checking out, they refused to let me take a trolley up to the room, with a monosyllabic explanation ""liability"".

My wife and I officially began our lives together here with a wedding and honeymoon; and it has always been a very special place for us to go, spend time, and watch sunsets together. Here we have enjoyed a smaller, quieter, more attentive hotel compared to other properties in Waikiki. We’ve always looked forward to our visits with great anticipation. But, to say that our most recent visit in late August, 2016 was not good...would be an understatement. This will not be a five star review of this hotel like I've written in the past. However, I will try to make this review, likely my last for this property, as objective as possible.There is no doubt that the views from the ocean-front rooms are spectacular, but can be a little pricey depending on the room you choose. Our room, ""The Waikiki Suite""-917) was north of $1,500 for 2 nights. The standard rooms are just too small---way smaller than an average hotel room. We arrived in late afternoon and our room was not ready. This can happen and, we were offered another room to stay in until ours was ready. When we did get our keys and went to settle in and relax before dinner, we noticed a dirty dish in the sink...tsk,tsk,tsk!When we arrived at the Hau Tree Lanai for dinner, they did not have record of our reservations made 5 days earlier...not good! We were seated but at a sub prime table---This was my 70th birthday dinner. At this point I'm not too happy. I won't go any further with this but I did hand write a letter to the hotel manager voicing my disdain.Afterward on our beautiful lanai to enjoy the evening, noise from a live band a short distance from the ""quiet end of the beach"" breaks out. Our visit here is now gone and overrides the good experiences here. At checkout, there was no non-courtesy, but there was no real courtesy either. Just ""review your bill and sign please"". No usual how was your stay or hope to see you again soon. At check-in, there was noticeably more courteousness. Upon arriving home, I had been billed for valet parking for our entire stay of 2 nights---we did not have a car. We did later contact the Otani, and they credited our bill for the nearly 60 bucks. I wish they would have credited the ""Resort Fee"" also. This is not what I would consider a resort---theire is not even a pool!To summarize, most hotel rooms here are too small, the area is not as quiet as advertised, there are limited dining options, it is a long walk back to the main part of Waikiki (guess 1/2 mile +), Not everyone is as courteous as they should be all the time, And I'm still angry about not being seated near the water for my birthday! There is a Hawaiian word ""pono"". It means doing the right thing, at the right time for the right reasons. The Otani should study this word.Finally, the hotel is a little dated in some areas. Not that this bothers me...I'm more into other things; but noted for the readers information. If you decide to book here...please enjoy for me. My wife and I have had many good past experiences. However, we will likely not ever come this way again.","Atlanta, Georgia","Bobss</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",33,3.0

You can walk through the park or by the beach. The food at New Otani was good, we mostly ate breakfast, about $22. I really don't need a lot of bells and whistles, that you will pay through the nose for, (Hawaii is already too pricey) but I think this place really needs is a whirlpool or hot tub. If you are taking a lot of tours,(like we did) plus, the walk to/from the hotel...you could really use one at the end of the day. We wanted something like we were used to when we go to Fla.

The room I was up graded to was a BEAUTIFUL view of the beach and Diamond head with wrap around windows and lanai.

I remember my brother staying at the New Otani a couple years ago and saying it was a good place to stay, especially away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki.

Easy check-in and right up to our room. We got one of the smaller rooms (you can see the various sized rooms on the Emergency Plan info on the door) and it's size reminded me of some of the hotel rooms we stayed in while in Japan. Just enough room to fold out our small suitcase we brought along. The bathroom is a bit cramped if two people are trying to get ready in the morning. The shower did have drainage issues but had good pressure. I believe the king-sized bed might have been two twins put together because we could feel an indentation down the middle. We had a partial view of Diamond Head, although the iconic ""end"" part of it was blocked by another building. The beach and ocean was visible but looking over the balcony. Easy check-out early the next morning. Staff including the front desk employees and valets were friendly.I'd recommend this hotel if you're on a quick overnight trip or if you want a quiet place to stay.

I am used to the Hyatt resort, Hawaii prince, Sheraton Moana (when I can afford) and Marriott resort and spa. This would be my last choice.The staff are nice, but a very casual attitude. More like a motel attitude. I shouldn't have to explain. I had a standard ocean view room room 516. The room was small but the view was fantastic if you want to just sit on the lanai the whole time. My room seemed clean but carpets need to be pulled, they were starting to gather.The bed, I feel, was b class. Very holidayinish, one of those overnight hotel beds along the highway.The balcony was nice though you can peak very easily around the barrier to see in other rooms. This gave me a lack of privacy and security.Very quiet out here. Was a 20 minute walk to Waikiki or 1hour full paced walk to Ala Moana shopping center. It took me with catching the bus an hour and a half. By the time I walked to the Hyatt area (20 minutes) then 35 minute wait for the Waikiki trolley then the 30 minute ride to shopping center, I was exhausted. Of course I had just flown 12 hours.Restaurant doesn't open until 7am and there is nothing for a 20 minute walk.Bed linens are changed every couple days unless you put card on pillow. The shower was awful, no pressure and the shower had was one of those removable hand held devices. Not saying that you ""have"" to hold it. The draining of water was ""super"" slow so your standing in a pool up to your calves the whole time.There is ""no gym"". They do offer spa service but you pay. I can go anywhere for that. The workout is your walking.I was up at 5am starving. Was at restaurant at 6am. No open until 7. So I can't really go anywhere unless the plan was to stay out, but they have a great locomoco breakfast dish (google it).You see my dilemma right? Nothing really opens until 9am.The pros:Quiet, on the beach and good food at the Hua tree restaurant in the hotel. Staff are nice not ""super nice"".The cons:Too far from everything, no shuttle service. The staff are nice but not super nice. There is no gym. I don't like the lanai barriers. No pressure in shower and slow drain. Small rooms.This place is great for the late riser who wants it quiet and doesn't care about bed or their time. They just want to relax. Even being a distance, it's not motivating to want to do that 30 minute walk to the center of Waikiki then walk some more then a 30 minute walk back.

I watched the sunrise for the 3 mornings we were there. What a beautiful sight. The staff is constantly going out their to may their guests feel at home. Wonderful views of the Ocean and Olomana Mountain.

The New Otani, on the other hand, is a beautiful place, with character and a peaceful vibe. Has 2 restaurants with a beautiful picturesque view of the sunset.

This was our ninth time to Hawaii, and our 4th time to stay at the New Otani. The Ocean Front Deluxe Room was wonderful. It had quality upgrades. It was a comfortable size for two people. And, the view was spectacular. It was super quiet. The bed was very comfortable. The room was very clean. I have only good things to say about this room.You can see my other reviews of the New Otani and notice we have always stayed in the Ocean View Superior rooms, which have been in various states of refurbishment. They have not been as nice, so I was very pleasantly surprised at how much better this upgraded room was.We originally had booked the Ocean View Superior room this time as well. However, when I went to confirm my reservation, I noticed that the price had dropped considerably, from the rate at which I had booked the room. I asked the reservation agent, if I could get the new, lower rate, and she hesitated. So, I asked if I could be upgraded to another room, and she agreed.From this point on, I will always request this room, because it was fantastic.The service at the hotel, is still just o.k. No one was rude…but, no one was exceptionally friendly or helpful….No one exuberated that “aloha” spirit. The common areas of the hotel are still bland and dated. The interior atrium, hallways and elevator corridor looks like a public institution and need some updates. The lobby area is also very dated and run-down. The furniture is worn, and the tile flooring looks like the original when the hotel was built in the 1960's.Also of note, there were far fewer homeless people camped in the park.With the above said, I will return to this hotel.

This means that it's a 15-20 minute walk to the main restaurant strip in Waikiki. This wasn't a negative at all for me as I don't mind walking. In return, you get a hotel which is quiet, away from the traffic noise which seems to plague most of the other hotels, large rooms and an uncrowded beach at a price much below what you'd pay in the main part of town. The rooms have been recently refurbished and so look very fresh. There are good quality amenities in the bathroom and there is a bar fridge in the room (something which a lot of the more expensive hotels don't seem to include for some reason). The room was very large by Waikiki standards and had a full wardrobe as well as another chest of drawers, so plenty of room to unpack. Staff were pleasant and happy to cater for requests such as providing tea bags and a kettle for the room. I didn't have an ocean view but instead had a view over Diamond Head which was quite pretty and given the ocean was only a 2 minute walk away, I didn't miss not being able to see it from my room. Others have questioned the $10 resort fee as there is no pool, however, it does cover wi-fi, a daily newspaper and the use of towels, umbrellas and beach chairs. Given umbrellas and chairs were $10 per hour to hire on the main beach in Waikiki this didn't seem like bad value to me. They also have surfboards for hire and the surf is way less crowded than at the main beach. I ate in both the restaurants. I would classify the food as good but not great in both, however, the service was very good and they both have great views of the sunset so are worth going to if you don't feel like heading into town. A tip since the sunset views seem to get mentioned in almost all of the reviews of the restaurant - you can sit on the beach in front of the restaurant and take in exactly the same sunset view for free if you don't want to dine in.This was my 5th trip to Waikiki. The 3 others hotels I stayed in before this one were the Holiday Inn, Vibe and the Hotel Renew. I definitely prefer this hotel over any of these and would definitely stay there again next time I come to Waikiki.","Sydney, Australia","cmcinsydney</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",66,4.0

The oceanfront rooms have lanai's that offer breathtaking views of a gorgeous beach and ocean. The oceanfront lanai also provides you with a great view of Diamond Head mountain.The superior ocean view is also worth it and offers a straight view of the ocean along with views of the Waikiki hotel strip.You can see the Friday night fireworks from either of these type of rooms. Both rooms were simple and clean. We stayed in both types of rooms offered and my mom and I really enjoyed ourselves. Like I said before I travelled with my mom and our only goal was to relax and enjoy the beach. On the days that my mom did not feel up to going down to the beach she was able to just relax on our lanai or just open up the doors and listen to the sound of the ocean waves. Priceless. I fell asleep a couple of very late nights/early mornings listening to the waves. I really enjoyed sitting on the lanai very late and listening to the waves. We ate dinner at Miyako once and lunch at the Hua Tree. Service was great at both restaurants. It was really nice to sit back and enjoy the view while eating lunch at the Hua Tree. It is best to make a reservation. Several mornings we ordered room service for breakfast. Breakfast and lunch was pretty reasonable. Eating at the hotel can get a little pricy, and I wanted different options for dinner. Therefore, many nights I walked and picked up dinner from the Barefoot Beach Cafe and a couple of nights I picked restaurants in Waikiki. PF Changs, Subway, whatever we were in the mood for. There are two walking paths to Waikiki. One is a flagstone path along the beach and the second is a walk down Kalakaua Avenue. It is a nice walk with lots of shade down this sidewalk. There are lots of Banyan trees to protect you from the sun and you pass the Aquarium during your walk to Waikiki. There is a park right next to the hotel along with Queen Kapiolani right across the street. There is a convenient store named Russel's store on the property that has many items available if you've missed something while packing. There is a laundry service available for a fee and/or a laundrymat also available for use if needed. This is a very calm area. There is so much to do in Waikiki, with lots of shopping and restaurants. You can rent a car and go to another beach if you don't prefer this one. But again there is lots to do on this island. This is truly a great place to stay. All staff was eager to please and went out of their way to accommodate. The cleaning staff was the best. Turndown service is there if needed. The rooms are a little bit small but the lanai's made up for that. Also, real estate is pretty expensive here so you get what you pay for. If you want to party I would suggest staying closer to the Waikiki end. And who doesn't love to party. But if you want to relax then this is a great place to stay. I went back and forth as to whether I should stay here or at a different hotel and I am ultimately glad that I stayed here. My mother agreed. This is not my first time in Oahu, but it has been a while. I am glad that we had such great peace while staying here. Honolulu has become a bit touristy so try not to visit during spring break. I would stay here again with an Oceanfront room on a high floor (hint). I do plan on visiting again but would like to visit another island. I had a layover in Kahului and would like to stay there once. I will still make sure to come back and visit Kaimana Beach and The New Otani. Thanks for making our stay a great one.

Vote A. I love that I am closed enough to Waikiki, but not close enough to have to deal with the hustle and bustle of it. However, that being said, then you need to have a car if you plan to eat in Waikiki every night or even if you plan to stroll along Kalakaua Ave (where the fancy shops are). Without it it would be a long stroll and, in high humidity days, not necessarily a pleasant one. On the other hand, if you plan to walk to the top of Diamond Head, then you are closer than staying at most hotels in Waikiki.PARKING: Vote B-. It is valet parking only. As the parking lot is very small, it is necessary to rely on valets. Valets are very efficient though. However, when there is a line, one might have to wait a little longer than he or she would like to. Many people are put off by the fact that they have to pay a daily fee for parking, but in Waikiki that is true pretty much everywhere. So this hotel cannot be judged negatively just because of that. ROOMS: VOTE from C+ to A. I was lucky as I could get a corner room with a view on the Ocean on the Waikiki side (like the one in the picture). I loved it. Vote A. I have seen other rooms and I was not so impressed. Of course, one pays extra for the privilege to stay at one of the corner rooms. The room decor is not exceptional, but it is practical and clean; besides, the views from the window pretty much make one forget about the rest. The bathroom is smallish in size, but it works. Overall, rooms are not big in size. There is a fridge.LOBBY/HALLWAYS: VOTE B. Nothing great. The last time I was there the hotel was under renovations. They do a little at the time. So the rooms will improve and the hallways are probably going to be looking better, but it is very basic and strikes a contrast with the tenor of the rooms, at least the choicest rooms.RESTAURANTS: VOTE B. There is some choice on the premises, but honestly it is very limited compared to all the variety one can find in Waikiki. For that reason alone, I rent a car, i.e., so that I can travel around and eat at different places. There is a small store that sells some grocery, but the items available are very limited. There is more choice at one of the supermarkets that are located maybe 1 mile away. Be aware that some packages come with free breakfast and some don't. It was not a big deal for my wife and I as we planned from the start to sample traditional Hawaiian foods and so we were often driving to specialty stores.NOISE: VOTE B. The hotel per se is quiet. No loud students or people in general. This type of hotel is not very suitable for students in terms of cost, ambiance, and activities. So one is safe against this kind of issue. But one cannot avoid the people at the nearby park and sometimes noise begins at 7am. High volume radios mostly. It is not the hotel people, it is the public park though. Sure if you stay at one of the towers of the Hyatt for example, you might hear less of it, but then it is a totally different experience.""PRIVATE BEACH"": VOTE A-. It is nice, it is not crowded and it is relaxing. You can get towels and chairs in the hotel lobby. Not a great place to snorkel though. We used it for 2 days, then we went around O'hau to try different locations and beaches. Not a major issue, as long as you are renting a car. OVERALL: VERY GOOD HOTEL. A little difficult to book as it is on the smallish side and rooms tend to fill fast. Prices can vary a lot like on the rest of the island. I would consider this hotel only if I can stay at one of their higher end rooms. Otherwise, I can just stay in Waikiki (this is Waikiki as a matter of fact, but I mean closer to where the action is) because if the room does not have a view, there is little to do after one goes back to his or her room. For the food, the place is adequate and there is not much choice on the premises or around it. The most desirable feature, for me personally at least, is that it is quiet and it does not feel like a zoo as soon as you leave your room which happens at much bigger hotels. Of course, not on a par with the top choices on the island, but then neither are their prices.","Agoura Hills, United States","Maurizio T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Agoura Hills, United States</strong>",19,4.0

We were intrigued by the reviews, but once I saw how busy and loud Waikiki beach was I was so grateful for this location. It's a very short (but beautiful) walk to town either on the beach or through the park. Both are well lit with people around so I never felt uncomfortable walking at night. You can literally hear the city noise fading away as you get closer to the property.There's no pool, but we prefer the beach and they have a beautiful one here. It was never over-crowded even though all beaches are public. The hotel provides towels and beach mats, and even let us use chairs at no charge after we asked. We reserved the Ocean Front Deluxe room (818) and it was spacious and beautiful. The bed was really comfortable- my only complaint was that the pillows were really hard so after two nights I left a note for housekeeping and came home to find two awesome down pillows on the bed. We had a huge bathroom and also a really long balcony. We couldn't have asked for a better view.Do not miss breakfast! I'm not even a breakfast eater, but this was some of the best food I had in Hawaii (and we'd spent the previous week at the Westin in Maui!) We had the regular breakfast with a huge piece of ham, potatoes, eggs, toast, and coffee. On the last day there I ordered the Macadamia/Coconut French toast with fresh berries, and discovered their coconut syrup- I thought I'd died and gone to Carb Heaven.I can't brag on the staff enough! All of the Valet staff were eager to assist in any way possible, but Tony was soooo helpful in recommending local ""dives"" for the best food. (Ono Hawaiian Foods is incredible- get the lau lau) He had the best personality, and full of energy. I'd already mentioned our awesome housekeeping lady, and the concierge, Joy, was on point if we needed a car rental or info. I would highly recommend this property, especially if you hate crowds.

Usually we stay at the Disney Aulani for a few nights then somewhere in Waikiki, usually Hilton Hawaiian Village. This year I wanted a more relaxing experience than the zoo at the Hilton, so I researched and found this hotel. It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the edge of Waikiki, near the Duke Kahanamoku statue and plenty of restaurants. The hotel building is directly on the beach. No roads to cross. No parking lots to cross. Just go out and there is the sand and water. It is a smaller boutique style hotel. The common areas are dated. The room we stayed in looked like it has been remodeled recently. It is really nice and modern. We booked the Robert Louis Stevenson Suite (9th floor) for 3 people. We had a queen bed and a small sitting area/living room with sofa and chair. There was also a table for dining. We had plenty of room. Our lanai directly faced the ocean. We could see Waikiki to the right and were able to watch the Friday night fireworks right from the lanai. We had 2 night chairs and one lounge chair on the lanai. The atmosphere was a bit more formal here than we are used to for Hawaii. The sign in the lobby stated you had to have shoes and shirts on. We are more used to being able to run around with no shoes and in swim wear almost anywhere in the hotel areas. Not a big deal, just something to mention. We used room service for breakfast one morning and ate at the restaurant the next morning with a reservation. I had read to make a reservation or you wouldn't get to eat there for breakfast, but on the morning we were there, it seemed like there were plenty of open tables. Everything was clean, the view can't be beat. I heard that the regular rooms are a little small, but the suite was great. Couldn't hear noise from the other rooms. There were fewer guests, so no noisy kids running up and down the halls like in bigger hotels. They have towels and mats available at the bell hop desk. The beach in front of the hotel was busy but never seemed too crowded to enjoy. I did not realized there was a reef not too far out and it is awesome for snorkeling. There were tons of fish. We even saw the state fish humuhumunukunukuapuaa. My son was pretty happy about that. This was big for us because Hanauma Bay had been closed due to jellyfish while we were there, so this was a good alternative to that without the crowds. Website was specific about which rooms were suites, but the other classifications of rooms were less clear. It was hard to know the view you would get without knowing the floor you would be on. We wanted the suite for the room and it guaranteed us a high floor and amazing views. For the other rooms, you would almost need to contact the hotel but I don't know if they guarantee a floor before check in.Overall, this is a great hotel. The wifi was not great at all. Hardly ever stayed online. The lack of crowds is much more relaxing than main Waikiki. It is pretty expensive compared to what you can get in Waikiki, but worth it for the atmosphere. Also, getting to other food options is not too far away and that can save you a lot of money as well.","Springfield, Illinois","711bingo711</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Springfield, Illinois</strong>",77,5.0

The staff was very hospitable and welcoming. The upgraded room was very roomy, the original was small and a bit cramped... so choose carefully as an upgrade might not be available. There is parking in the streets, but the Pro Bowl Beach party was a 1/4 mile away on the same beach and they closed the street for 2 days, so the valet parking was great.

I stayed here in May for combination business / pleasure. There was a minor snafu with my reservation--in that despite my confirmation number in print with the days of my stay, the person at the registration desk could not find a record of my arriving the day I arrived on her computer. It was a split bill, but the same confirmation number. It was a bit disconcerting, as I had never been to Hawaii, had just gotten off a 6 hour flight and had no room available. Further, the person at the desk was not offering any solutions to the problem, just telling me I had no reservation. Finally, I said, ""OK, you have no reservation for me for this evening, but do you have ANY rooms available for tonight?"" And of course, they had an available room, just not the room I was supposed to stay in. So for my first night, I stayed in a room facing Diamond Head. It was a one-bedroom and it served its purpose. Wifi was spotty though, and I had to hold my device on one corner of the couch for it to work. Also, while the room had a nice view of Diamond head, there were two small drawbacks. First, it overlooked the parking lot and some guests could get a bit loud. Second, the room, particularly the bathroom, was bit tired.After that first night, I spent next few days in the main hotel (so I checked out, had my bags held and checked back in later that afternoon). The room was much smaller than my first, but very modern and had a lovely view of the ocean and Waikiki. Wifi was much better in this room, but there was a trick to getting the right connection.In both rooms, my bed was very comfortable and I slept well. The amenities were great (L'Occitane soap? Yes, please!). The staff were generally very friendly and helpful except the first person who had real difficulty troubleshooting a botched reservation. The hotel is situated just outside of the busy downtown area, close enough to walk but distant enough to avoid the hustle and bustle.I ate at the Sunset Lanai lounge one evening (beef and chicken skewers). Service was a tad slow, but good and the food was good. Another evening I ate at the Hau Tree Lanai and ordered the catch of the evening, broiled with the Citrus-Mango sauce. That was one of the best meals I have ever had while traveling.In all, I cannot wait to return to Hawaii and stay at the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel.","Aliso Viejo, California","marlindorie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aliso Viejo, California</strong>",13,4.0

This means that you enjoy all of the benefits of being in Honolulu with many places to eat and cultural amenities but you are surrounded by the park rather than the ""concrete jungle"" of the city. This time we paid a bit more and booked a corner room facing Diamond Head Mt. Well worth it, if you can get it reserves since these book up. It looked like the room was recently remodeled. Everything was new and nice. The carpet, tile, paint job were neat and clean. The cleaning staff keep the room spotless. We enjoyed the view of the mountain and the park and had a large deck. We requested and received a high floor to avoid road noise. The room is very quiet. Never heard our neighbors. It was just a delightful place to spend our pre-Christmas holiday. When we were there it was raining more than usual and so right when we wanted to walk to dinner in town a rain storm come up. That meant we chose to eat at the hotel. Very nice. The main restaurant is pricy, but with a view like that we didn't complain. The Japanese restaurant is fantastic. We ate there twice.The only drawback was that we requested a king sized bed. They can't guarantee that. So we were disappointed when we walked into the room and saw a queen bed. We don't really sleep very well in a queen. To solve that problem my wife slept on the pull out couch (hey, her choice). Next time we will have to choose another hotel that can give us a king. But, we liked our stay and if you will too I am sure.

It is located at the far end of the beach near Diamond Head, so it is not convenient if you want to be in the middle of all the 'action', but if you want to be in the center of all that is happening and don't mind a short bus ride or a 20 minute walk then this would be a hotel to consider. Our room was not large and faced Diamond head and not the sea, but was very reasonable in cost, so was fine for us. There is a very nice breakfast area that is basically on the beach and quite popular. It is also open for lunch as well. The hotel caters a lot to Japanese tourists and so has a fine Japanese restaurant on the 2nd floor. If you're are looking for a place right on the beach which is never crowded and are not looking for all kinds of resort amenities...there is no pool...then this would be a hotel to consider.",maine,"fisham</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>maine</strong>",54,4.0

We were very pleased with the modern rooms [large bathrooms] and loved having balconies right on the ocean. It was wonderful to wake up, sit out on the balcony [eating papaya] watching the pink sky and hearing the surf - and for two mornings - checking out the Monk seal who slept for hours on the beach. The sunset was equally beautiful. The open air lobby has not been renovated, but fun to sit and watch happy people on vacation - it was a busy place. The staff is very nice and helpful. We got good information from the valet and the bell captain. Renovations were taking place on our floor - never heard them, but did see the workers who were always pleasant and trying hard not to be in the way. Very happy to get acquainted with this part of Waikiki. Beautiful Queen's beach, easy to walk towards the aquarium and see bunches of tropical fishies [not in the aquarium]. Kapiolani Park is fantastic to see Diamond Head up close or have a picnic under a banyan tree. Nice jogging and walking in interesting neighborhoods.

The Ocean Front Waikiki Deluxe (on the corner of the building facing the ocean and Waikiki) was just superb - and we're fussy - and very good value when compared with other more popular waterfront properties in Waikiki. The views were to die for and the sunsets absolutely spectacular. Our room (8th floor) had been redecorated and we found it most comfortable and stylish. We had breakfast each morning in the Hau Tree Lanai and the staff were always accommodating in our request for a front table adjoining the gorgeous beach right out front (just be sure to book ahead). However, don't bother to take the deal where breakfast is included in the tariff, as there is no advantage price-wise we discovered.

Well I got the one room that had no ocean view, no elevator, and minimal air conditioning. While it was a decently appointed suite, for the price it was average at best. I had to lug my luggage up three flights of stairs without so much as an offer of assistance from the bellman when I checked in. The hallways look like something out of the 1960s that you might see as in the original Hawaii 5-0 TV show where some crime has just occurred: dark, narrow, and somewhat seedy. The ""Fitness Room"" was locked the entire time I was there, with some dog inside guarding it I suppose, but I was not in Hawaii to do my exercise indoors anyway, so it did not matter but I had to walk by it every day and it did seem weird. Restaurant food for breakfast and lunch provided large portions, but was only warm, not hot and did not seem like it was freshly cooked. Overpriced as well, but in Hawaii, one comes to expect that to a degree. Great location right next to Kapiolani park and Outrigger Canoe Club.

It was kind of a far walk from the main strip but I liked how it was away from the noise. The problem I had was with the employee, Mai, who had checked us in. When we got there the room was not ready and we didn't receive any explanation on why or an apology and she made me feel like we were wrong for checking in. Also, I was informed during check-in that I received a package but I forgot to actually receive it since we had to wait for our room. A couple of days later I went back down to ask the front desk for my package and they told me that I didn't have anything. We went back and forth for a bit and they finally said that I did receive a package but that Mai had deleted the record so that was why they could not see it. I was really disappointed from the start and that was really not the way that I wanted to start my vacation. The front desk staff really gives the first impression of the hotel and my first impression was not good.

We ended up having no power to one side of the room where the TV was plugged into. As we packed we wanted some entertainment. Hardly got an apology by the receptionist when we checked out. In addition they charged me for valet parking for our entire stay when we only used it once. They were nice enough to take it off and even comped us for the valet service we did use. The location is amazing as well as it is close enough to the Waikiki strip yet far enough to avoid the noise and craziness.

The beach is lovely, perfect for distance swimming as well as small children who like playing in the waves and building sand castles. The location is very nice and not at all in the midst of Waikiki. The bad: The apartment bedroom has no useable natural light because the window opens onto a corridor. They charge for toll-free phone calls and calls to the hotel's shops from the room. Weak Internet access in the apartment, bizarrely unfriendly staff at the desk where you book rental cars, tours, etc. Expensive restaurant with a pretty limited choice. They do give you beach towels and mats for no charge, but not other beach gear as another reviewer seemed to imply.

To be honest, we booked this hotel as it was the only one we could afford on Oahu. The reviews were mainly favourable at the time that we booked, and seemed to gradually decline in the 10 or so months until our visit. First and probably foremost, there is no pool! It is right on the beach, granted, but swimming in the sea is not for everyone, and while they don’t hide the fact that there’s no pool, it is not widely publicised. I was also under the impression it was a private hotel beach - not so.Secondly, it is a trek from Waikiki centre. Ok in the day time, not so great after dark when you’re walking through Kapiolani Park with all the homeless people hanging out: in their cars, in the public toilets, on the benches, wherever.Thirdly, the service wasn't great. Nothing in the way of a smile or friendly greeting on checking in, and reached our room to find we had been allocated twin beds. Clearly we were (and are) a married couple – what’s that all about! We were moved when I complained, and actually pretty much lucked out with a side room on the 8th floor (823) with a partial view of Diamond Head and the ocean, beautiful. Found room to be quite dated in terms of furniture/ décor, but it was clean enough, and had a certain island charm. Don’t think it helped that we flew in from Vegas, where everything is massive and shiny and looks brand new. We ate in the Hau Tree Lanai restaurant a couple of times for breakfast, which was amazing and would definitely recommend. We did always seem to get the table with the tree going straight through it, guess we just have those kinds of faces. If there were any toilets in the restaurant area, we would have ended up sat right outside them!Have to hold my hands up and admit that things may have changed in the 2 years since we visited (was actually June 2013, how time flies), but I’m pretty sure they haven’t built a pool, and it’s disappeared from the Thomas Cook brochure, which I think is telling. I would say if you’re going to shell out to get to Waikiki, make the most of it and stay somewhere a bit more expensive nearer the centre. You can then save money by eating loads of free sample cookies at the Hawaiian Cookie Company instead of actual meals.","Salford, United Kingdom","The_new_Mrs_Hey</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salford, United Kingdom</strong>",5,3.0

The beach at the New Otani is excellent! It has quiet waves and is very swimmable and child friendly. We saw people snorkeling in the morning. The sand isn't the soft white sand you find at Lanikai-- it is a little courser but still fine.We opted for the cheapest room and it wasn't bad. It is OLD and SMALL but clean. We really only needed a comfortable bed for sleeping and we were fine. We were given a partial ocean view and we could see the beach from the patio, which was nice but we didn't really spend any time on the patio because the condo next door was only 10 feet away and could see straight into our room.The other great thing about this location is that you skip the Waikiki traffic so it's much easier to get to other destinations on the island. It is also close enough to walk to the busy streets/restaurants/attractions in Waikiki.We kind of missed having a pool.

Any room ending in 17 is a hit. We were offered the suite upgrade at checkin and they let us look and yes, it's the top floor and is much bigger, but in the end we chose our lower corner room because the views were amazing and the corner is so private, nobody can see you nor can you see them. We loved the wraparound balcony and enjoyed evening drinks watching the sunset. The room was a perfect size for us, really no complaints. We did find the hallways to be a bit tired and carpets not vaccumed daily (not so nice for a beach hotel). The free rented beach mats and towels were great and the private beach steps from the front was soooo much better than venturing jnto crazy Waikiki. We were in Waikiki for some snorkling and surfing activities and each time we looked at each other relieved we didn't have to stay there! Parking was ok at New Otani, after 6pm the free beach parking is plentiful but we did have some trouble during the day to find spots. Dining was great and we made full use of all our options. Room service was fast and with a smile (max 20 mins to wait) and we enjoyed lunch, cocktails and afternoon tapas at the lounge. Breakfast in the Hau Tree is crowded and a bit hectic, we only did it once then opted to find a local (more affordable and better food) option down the street called Bogart's- highly recommend. For dinner at Hau Tree we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food especially all fish dishes. We also dined in a cabana at their Japanese restaurant the last night (you have to call ahead for the private cabana but it's really worth it). Delicious food!Overall service and our stay was unforgettable. Will miss sleeping with the balcony open to hear the waves at night!

The hotel is directly on the beach and far from the very commercial strip on the other side of Waikiki meaning if you want to rest away from the crowd, be on the beach and have no other hotel in front of your window is certainly the best choice! Waikiki is not a very long beach and you can walk easily in 15 minutes or less to the other end. I would only advise the corner rooms (or the ocean view ones eventually) but the corner rooms with two big sliding windows and a balcony making a corner too are really pleasant and a pure delight for the eyes and mind. You see the ocean, the beach, the war memorial( swimming pool), the city, the mountains, everything is spectacular from there. The beach at the foot of the hotel (no road, no cars, just a small bendy parking road) is just perfect for families or people that are scared of big waves meaning very relaxing. The room is not very spacious but furnished with taste and the bathroom is pretty small but I really don't care. There was no minibar but a fridge which is handy and a coffee pot. My main problem was more to adapt myself to the schedules of this international hotel with a restaurant closing at 9PM as well as room service! And breakfast not served late in the morning, a shock for international travelers that want to make most of their days and still be able to grab a snack or have a romantic time at a restaurant latter at night! The reception people were efficient but a bit too much in a hurry to explain things and we were held for 45 minutes in the lobby to get our room ready after a long journey (although we were there at the right checking time) with nothing to drink or even a water fountain, I found this a bit rough and would advise them to offer a welcome drink. Otherwise the hotel is very clean and the maids excellent. Again the achitecture and situation are very pleasant and I would recommend this hotel to my friends although trying to get a better value if they stay more than a day or two. I understood that finally Oahu is not a big island and even if you want to visit the rest of the island, this hotel can be a nice homebase and you really do not need to find a different one on the island as Waikiki has more restaurants and relaxed activities than anywhere else...",Paris,"Readytrip</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris</strong>",40,4.0

We were pleasantly surprised to find a basic but comfortable hotel on Kaimana Beach which is a quiet neighborhood about 3/4 mile south of the bustling part of Waikiki Beach, which suited us fine. I had a Navy admiral at the change of command tell me ""Oh the New Otani is like a Motel 6 you should have stayed at the W Hotel in Honolulu."" I was only slightly offended having stayed in plenty of W and other high end hotels while traveling for business and not feeling like I had missed anything at all. Fast forward 10 years and my wife and I recently took a quick trip to Oahu to do some fishing and stayed three nights at -- you guessed it -- the New Otani. The hotel has only gotten better with some refurbishment having occurred. The rooms are in the classic Japanese-hotel-style -- smallish and somewhat spartan but neat and tidy. We had an ocean-view room looking back up towards Waikiki, which was really a treat. The Japanese restaurant served quality Japanese cuisine (I've traveled extensively in Japan and know my Japanese food) and the terrace restaurant overlooking the beach is awesome for Hawaiian-style breakfasts (make sure you make a reservation). I am sure if we get back to Waikiki we will likely be staying at the New Otani again.","San Diego, California, United States","RonHinSD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California, United States</strong>",14,4.0

Staying at the NEW OTANI I was right on the edge of the action and simultaneously felt like I was in the country because the experience was so easy, intimate, completely relaxing and literally so green. As a former Honolulu resident and concierge, the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel is the obvious best choice( yes much better than friends homes or AirBnB) not because this hotel is oozing with tropical flourishes in terms of décor or design but it because:1. It puts me smack up against Diamond Head2. Gives me a beach (used by friendly locals as well as hotel guests) right outside the lobby door3. it’s a 5 minute stroll to the heart of Waikiki surfing, shopping and people watching 4. And last I love strolling through the 108 acre Kapiolani Park with its majestic ironwood and palm trees and host to everyone from concert goers and artists to tennis players, picnicking families and zoo visitors.Three more great reasons why I stay here:• There is no attitude at this hotel.• I don’t feel like anyone is trying to sell me anything.• I don’t feel like a tourist.Also, there are massive amounts of free and low cost parking directly surrounding the hotel so you don’t even need to valet your rental car and it’s a quick drive to downtown Honolulu or other parts of the island as freeway access is within 15 minutes of the hotel.PRICE:There were 17 room categories. I elected a partial ocean view and got upgraded. Considering both the hotel and the room amenities, I consider the price fair. I’ve also previously stayed in the lower priced economy room with a view mainly of swaying palms in the park and although considerably less luxurious was still able to enjoy all of the hotel’s other amenities.HOTEL AMENTIES:One restaurant, The Hau Tree Lanai (open for 3 meals a day) has good Zagat and Yelp ratings and although pricy, it’s a great place to have dinner at least once as you’ve got a front row seat to the beach, the sunset, and on Friday night free fire works. There is also a small low key bar, open air lobby, Japanese restaurant upstairs, and best of all they offer you beach towels, mats, chairs all as part of your stay. The hotels low key bungalow style structure also houses a convenience store, bathing suit shop, beauty shop, guest laundry and even a realtor!ROOMI was told that the majority of rooms including mine have been upgraded and although very neutral, beige, unexceptional at first glance, that’s deceiving the rooms features are terrific: a large comfortable queen with plenty of pillows including a large bolster pillow for viewing the flat screen TV , free wi fi access, a mini refrigerator, coffee maker, robes, lock box, lanai with view of the hotel skyline and beach, and a luxury style bathroom with granite sink area, thick white towels, tub/shower combo and upscale toiletries by L’Occitane En Provence.SERVICEAlthough it looks like an ordinary front desk they are professional and multifaceted handling everything from checking the accuracy of my WAZE app, to minor scraped knee emergencies as well as weighing and repairing luggage and even assisting me when my rental fender got scraped up. I think it speaks volumes that many of the employees are long term like Roger, the smiling valet and houseman who been there more than 30 years, and Tom, the cheerful Travel desk concierge. Allergic to false aloha and pretense, I just love this hotel because it feels like home.","San Francisco, California","madison k</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",13,4.0

We enjoyed stunning sunset views from the private balcony. The rooms were clean and comfortable, providing both daily room cleaning and evening turn down service. Staff were friendly and helpful. We did choose to pay for the valet parking. We were there the 3rd week in June and the public parking was used heavily by local residents. People started filling spots at 6:30 am setting up on the neighboring beach to park for the day and spots were full past dark so parking on your own that time a year may be a problem. When school in session, you may have better luck with street metered parking. We were pleased with the valet parking service and deemed it a necessary expense for us since public parking full at times we were looking for it. You need reservations if you want to eat at the restaurants in the hotel even for breakfast. We were on a busy schedule of sightseeing all over the island, so the times we called for reservations they were already booked until too late for us. We never ate there but they were in a beautiful location and while we were there they hosted 2 Japanese weddings. There is a convenience store on the property adjacent to the parking lot. They have a limited supply of sandwiches, fruit, veges, soda, beer, wine, etc that you can get by on. We found finding good restaurants challenging on the island so we had to lower our standards. It's either very high end pricy or low end choices so if you can plan your day around meal reservations you will eat better. A side note for planning : traffic on the island is a nightmare if you are not used to heavy traffic. Plan on extra time to get anywhere as traffic is very congested and slow moving.

Clearly it caters to Japanese tourists, as many of the hotel guests are Japanese (including large youth groups) and nearly all the hotel workers are fluent in Japanese - often more so than English. The hotel staff is unfailingly friendly and helpful. The location is ideal - a quiet spot about 15 minutes walk SE of Waikiki beach. The hotel has its own beach literally steps away. We really appreciated how the hotel was able to supply nearly any beach gear we could need - straw mats, towels, umbrellas, boogie boards, etc. Our room on the 7th floor had panoramic views of the ocean, Waikiki beach and high-rises, and lush green mountains to the east.We walked into Waikiki a couple times - a real zoo, not unlike the Las Vegas strip. We did have a lovely dinner at House Without a Key.Of the many fine aspects of our hotel, perhaps at the top is the hotel restaurant's breakfasts, among the finest I've had anywhere. First, the setting is spectacular. The restaurant is literally on the beach, but shaded by three mature trees (I'm guessing Hau trees, as that's the name of the restaurant.) The views of the ocean are wonderful, yet there's no wind or sun to worry about. They specialize in many versions of eggs benedict, all outstanding. The salmon benedict was at the very top of our list. The coconut/macadamia french toast is also amazing. Somehow, our room package came with daily breakfast for two, worth $33.50, or enough to get two full breakfasts daily, excluding tip. We had dinner there one night - excellent but perhaps not as exceptional as the breakfasts. Very romantic in the evening.From our hotel, we walked to Diamond Head crater, Waikiki, and the local restaurants on Kapahulu and Montserrat Streets. (Try Lau Lau at Ono's Hawaiian on Kapahulu. Delicious. One order is plenty for two.) Though we didn't go there, the hotel is virtually next door to an aquarium and a zoo. If you're feet get tired, you're always a quick Uber ride to the hotel. And the public bus service is pretty good - use Google maps to plot your route.What the hotel could do better: TVs were pretty small for this day and age. Internet wifi spotty, but at least it's free and it was sufficient for watching Netflix on our iPad. When we needed more reliable wifi, we used our iPhone as a wifi hotspot. These are very minor drawbacks. We would happily return!

The web site did describe the room as 'cozy' -- which translates into about 10x11 feet (plus the bathroom). There was a little chair, stool and table in the corner of the room, but using them would block any walking space. Still, our tiny room had a balcony with two chairs overlooking the ocean which was pleasant in the mornings and evening (in the direct sun in the afternoon and blocked from the breeze). There were no screens on the sliding door to the balcony, so as much as we'd have loved to hear the ocean at night, that wasn't a great idea. If you don't plan on spending any time in your room, the room we had could work. But if you need to actually get work done at some point, or you don't plan on being outside all day, it's best to review your room options carefully. The beach is beautiful - and with a larger room, this might be a good choice. We liked that we were next to the park and not in the heart of the city.

We stayed at the New Otani from April 8- April 15th 2015. I chose the New Otani because it's beach front on San Souci/Kaimana beach, and an excellent value money wise. The New Otani exceeded my every expectation! I booked an Ocean View room. We ended up on Floor 7 of the main building, room 720 with a gorgeous Ocean front Lanai/balcony overlooking the beach! We had splendid panoramic views of the sea life, beach goers, palm trees blowing in the warm trade winds and the waves hitting the shoreline. The sunsets from our private lanai were breathtaking. We honestly couldn't believe that the view wasn't a dream or some vivid painting. You can even see the Friday night Hilton fireworks from your lanai. Book at least an Ocean view room. You won't regret it.Logistics wise, the New Otani is an older hotel. There's no pool, hot tub or fancy fitness center. But who needs that with the beach and ocean right outside your door? Or you can hike to Diamond Head crater for a long adventure work out walk? Or go stroll in Kapiolani park which is directly behind the hotel. The Zoo and Aquarium are also nearby.Yes our room was a wee bit cozy. Not cozier than some of the rooms I've had in Japan, but just about right for two people. It had all the modern conveniences. Flat Screen TV, mini fridge, coffee maker, decent closet space, small bathroom and tub, with a line to dry your swimwear on, a small table and chair, and AC that worked well though it shuts off when you open the lanai sliding door. The wifi is free, but it's achingly slow. Think...snail slow! There is no resort fee here though which is a plus.The staff we encountered were all very friendly and helpful. We wanted for nothing. They helped with calling taxis, collecting bags, dispensing advice, letting us borrow beach towels and always had a friendly greeting upon our return. House keeping was efficient and tidy as well. Everyone treated us with the Aloha spirit.What made this hotel perfect for us was the ideal location. We loved being on this quiet beach. The vibe here is mellow, laid back and very popular with the locals rather than the tourist crowds. The sand is soft and plentiful, and the water calm enough to snorkel in. (we saw lots of fish here). It does fill up more on weekends when local families come to BBQ and play Ukulele. We found it to be charming and tranquil verses the noisy, crowded, smoke filled beaches of Waikiki. It is the perfect spot for an intimate romantic getaway. But not good for someone who wants in on a party scene or wanting a luxurious swanky hotel in a high rise. There are two restaurants at the hotel. The Hau Tree Lanai, under the Banyan tree which is very popular with Japanese tourists and has great breakfasts. Make reservations, because you'll need them. Or the Miyako a Japanese style upscale restaurant that we didn't visit. There is also a corner market, but it has very expensive prices. You have to take a bit of a walk to get into the more tourist areas in order to find other dining locations. The barefoot beach cafe isn't too far away if you want decent local style meals.It's about a 15 or 20 minute walk into the main parts of town from the New Otani. You can choose either a park walk way or the pathway by the ocean. The ocean path is very scenic,but also has no shade if that's an issue for you.

Although the hotel is a bit older, in terms of decor and furnishings, as compared to some other hotels, the location is unbeatable. It is on the other end of Waikiki, closer to Diamond Head, so much, much quieter and peaceful. You can still walk into ""central"" Waikiki (about a 10 min walk), plus have a beach right in front of the hotel. We opted for an ocean front room, so had the most incredible view. Ocean front rooms have a direct, front-facing view of the ocean. On our last stay here, we had an ocean view room, which was facing towards Waikiki, but still had a gorgeous view of the ocean. So, both room types are excellent. The staff were all very welcoming and kind. In particular, we enjoyed seeing ""older"" staff working at the hotel. The woman who brought us our room service was an older, ""local"" woman and it was really great to see that the hotel employees such people instead of simply replacing them with younger workers. We will be back on our next trip to Oahu!! Highlight: One morning, there was a Hawaiian monk seal sleeping on the beach in front of the hotel! We could see it from our balcony and also went down to see it from closer up.

We were able to see the Friday fireworks show at the Hilton, watch the waves, utilize easy beach access, and enjoy the balcony. There is no pool but it's not really a problem with the beach close by. Nice that they don't charge a resort fee and also offer free wi-fi. Downsides are: it's still Waikiki and the park next door can be noisy, bell and towel service and valet (but not all valets) were so-so, restaurant is ridiculously expensive.

We stayed in a moderate room on the 4th floor of the tower part of the hotel. The room was listed as ""no view"", so was much cheaper than the beach view rooms. However, when we sat on our balcony, we could still see the beach or diamond head, depending on which side we faced our chairs. True, the view was obstructed, but it was still nice.The moderate room, as others have mentioned, was quite small. For us, this presented a problem, as we had SO many suitcases. We were in Hawaii on a stopover while immigrating from Canada to New Zealand. If we hadn't had so many bags, the room would have been fine.The room itself was clean and housekeeping did a good job. The beds were comfortable and the hotel was very quiet at night. We slept really well!The biggest plus for this hotel is the proximity to the beach. You literally walk out the door of the hotel and you are just a few steps away. At the same time, because it is on the far side away from Waikiki, it is quiet and much more peaceful than where many of the other hotels are. I'd say that it's about a 15 minute pleasant walk along the beach to get to the main area of Waikiki with the shopping areas from the hotel.The staff at the hotel were very nice, especially the valets. Special mention to Kealli (hope I got the spelling right), who was fantastic to chat with and super helpful when we asked him questions. I would have given the hotel five stars if the room had been just a tad bigger, or if some kind of breakfast (even just a small continental) had been included in the price.We certainly intend to come back again, and commend the hotel on its service.

Having compared numerous hotels I booked this because of the cheap price and location as being slightly out of Waikiki was a bonus, e.g. not on the main strip.The room, the cheapest one was a moderate room. Having stayed in hotels in London and Paris I don't think the room was particularly small, compact but fine. It is dated and with the louvre bathroom doors and old style fittings but it was clean and perfectly functional. Our room had great views of Diamond Head and the beach too, you just turned your head to the right so we didn't pay to upgrade as we didn't see the point as we had just great views from our balcony. Our room was 924. There was a coffee machine which we used to boil water and an ice machine round the corner.

By the time I made it to the hotel I was exhausted and in need of a hot shower & rest. Imagine my shock when I can barely enter the room with my luggage. The room, described as ""moderate"", is their standard room. It would be barely 200sq feet, was dilapidated and tired. It resembled something out of a 1970s tv show!The following morning I raised my concerns with the Front Desk. They offered to move me to a Diamond Head view room for an extra $60 plus tax or an Ocean View room for $100 plus tax. In their defense, the room was booked through Hotel Tonight. The photos posted on the app show a renovated Diamond Head view room of approximately 280sq feet not the small and tired room (523) I was given. This amounts to blatant deceptive and misleading conduct.I declined the offer to move for a fee and took my concerns up with Hotel Tonight. They apologized and arranged for me to move rooms free of charge. This occurred about 9pm local time whilst I was out to dinner. The reality of moving at 11pm after a night out was not feasible so I remained in my original room. A further complaint resulted in an apology from Hotel Tonight and a $50 credit.The Hotel itself is dated and tired. I understand the rooms are undergoing renovations but my room certainly had not. My lanai looks out over the car park and onto the wall of an adjacent building. The noise from the generators and air conditioning unit outside is unrelenting. Moreover, the noise from idling tourist coaches at the front of the hotel occurs several times per day, not to mention delivery trucks and trash collection. My three-night layover has been somewhat of a nightmare. For an extra $50 per night I could of stayed in a reputable 4* hotel not this rundown dump! I'm told the breakfast here is good, as is the bar, but I've spent as little time here as possible. I have disputed the charge with American Express as I simply have not received the goods or serviced advertised and what has been provided is significantly different from what I was promised.On one final positive note I will say that the location is excellent. I have been visiting Hawaii for over 20 years and always stay around the Gold Coast / Diamond Head in either a hotel or apartment. It is away from the hustle and bustle but an easy walk to restaurants & bars.I'm still awaiting a response from Hotel Tonight...I will update this post once or if it is received.This morning I again followed up with the Hotel and they offered to move me, free of charge to a larger, renovated room. I have in turn contacted Hotel Tonight to highlight the discrepancies between the photographs, room description and hotel rating.

Couldn't have been more pleased. We originally booked an ocean front view, (highly recommended), and were surprised to get a free upgrade to a suite with a view of the ocean, Waikiki beach, and Diamond Head. The room was large with wrap around windows and three doors to the expansive corner lanai. Large bathroom with double sinks, glass enclosed shower with an additional deep tub. The wraparound lanai had a small table and two chairs and a chaise lounge. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the air conditioning was quiet and kept up comfortable. The staff was extremely attentive to our every need, (we requested additional hangers and they were delivered within minutes of our request). The Hau Tree restaurant served and excellent breakfast on the tree lined outdoor patio. Having the ocean only 50 feet away was a real treat as was the beautiful sunsets. We also had dinner at Miyako's Japanese restaurant on the 2nd floor. Delightful, authentic Japanese cuisine and service. A little pricey, but well worth every penny. The short walk to downtown Waikiki, (just 10-15 minutes) was enjoyable and quite safe as it is lighted and many people strolling to and from the area.  Had an great view of the Friday night fireworks on Waikiki and visits to the zoo and aquarium, both very close to the hotel. A very large park is across the street from the hotel so the area is quiet most of the time. The beach is quiet compared to the downtown area. However, it's the beach the locals use on weekend so it is much busier. The hotel also helped up rent a car and took care of all the details so we could just enjoy of stay. During our five day stay we walked from the hotel to Diamond head, (about a mile and a half each way). Great views, but a little challenging for folks not in good general condition. On the way back from Diamond Head we had a terrific lunch at a Hawaiian Mexican style eatery in a small strip mall. Good prices, and the rice bowl was delicious and filling.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants quiet, comfortable surroundings, excellent food and exceptional service. On the downside, the hotel charged $5.00 to use the computer for 30 minutes, which was the only negative regarding out stay. Yes.

The front desk manager came up with us and confirmed it smelled awful. He moved us back to the main hotel to a newly renovated room on the 6th floor which was lovely however moving 3 times in 3 days does not create for a stress free holiday. Also the taxi driver they called for us to drive us to Pearl Harbour refused to take a credit card for payment and when we made arrangements for a car rental pick up at the activity desk with Alamo no one showed up and they did not have a record of our reservation.

We stayed at this hotel 18 years ago when funds were tighter and I generally stay at nicer hotels now, but was so glad that I didn't overspend for this last trip to Oahu. We had a car and were really in HI to visit friends and eat good food so accomodations were not as much of a priority. We had been to Hanauma before, so snorkeling out in front of the hotel was perfect for us. This is probably what made our stay here so worthwhile. Clear, calm water with nice size tropicals, bone fish and even a small moray eel with the convenience of easy access to the hotel room. The beach was never super crowded and we liked being so near the water.Be sure to get a larger remodeled room with a balcony overlooking the water. We saw the fireworks at the Hilton over the water (on Fridays) and relaxed on the balcony admiring the ocean views. The bathrooms are fairly basic & small still, but the furnishings are nicely updated so provides a good value considering you have direct ocean access and am away from the hubbub of Waikiki central. The park next door hosts many locals having gatherings in the day, but gets very quiet at night.We had breakfast at the hotel once and the view was great. The food was good, but it's not easy getting a reservation for breakfast and there are a lot of great breakfast places if you have a car, so didn't really experience too much of the hotel food. I like the location because so much great Hawaiian food is within a short drive. Koko Head Cafe (Top Chef's Leeann Wong's place) and Alan Wong's for their tasting menu were a highlight! For local quick eats, we liked Diamond Head Grill (go in the store for incredible local desserts).Would return here for future visits to Oahu!","Los Angeles, CA","AndBeyond</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong>",160,4.0

I refuse to stay in the middle of the shopping mall that Waikiki has become, but like to be on the beach and reasonably close to my mom's retirement place in Punahou. When I lived in Hawai'i years ago, Kaimana was our regular beach. It's primarily a local crowd with a nice park adjacent and Kapiolani Park across the street. The Diamond Head view rooms are our favourite and, if you must, Waikiki proper's a short stroll down the beach. There's no pool, but there is the Pacific Ocean out the door. So A+ for location.I think the rooms are great. They're not particularly spacious or fancy, but you really shouldn't be spending much time in your room anyway. I'm over six feet tall and have no problems whatsoever. The staff are very helpful and friendly and the bar and Hau Tree Restaurant overlook the beach and offer very good food and drinks.

He went above and beyond in helping us- nothing was too much trouble and he was professional, helpful and sensitive to our needs. We would recommend the hotel on the quiet end of Waikiki beach- superbly clean, the place had a really good feel to it. Great little beach down below and walking distance to the delights of downtown Waikiki and beyond. Much better than those on the other end which felt a bit like ""Disneyland on steroids"" (if you know what I mean). We just wanted peace and quiet, which is what we got. A most enjoyable hotel to stay at. We were with a large group for a musical event across the road at Kapiolani Park, and to accommodate lots of visits from group members requested- and were given- a coffee percolator, microwave and electric jug for the duration of our stay.

I mean very happy and engaging for conversation with local tips. I was even invited to go diving. The rooms are dated but clean and has an evening turn down service from the old days that is just charming. The food at the Hau Tree is very good, however a little $$, for every night. Take a 10 minute walk to the Barefoot Cafe for a great dinner. The beach could not be closer or nicer. The only complaint I have is anyone with a tattoo must cover up all signs of a tattoo.

My room was spacious, the bed was comfortable, the linens had a nice feel to them and I could regulate the AC. I chose a room facing Diamond Head. Since I wasn't in the room very much, I didn't feel like paying an up charge to see the ocean and Diamond Head is gorgeous in the morning with the sun coming up behind it.But it was some little things that weren't quite right. There were tiles that had fallen off the baseboard in the tub area and the wallpaper was also beginning to peel. The drawers and doors in the dresser were askew.

We have been many times to Honolulu in the past but haven’t visited for a number of years. The Kaimana Beach has always been our favorite hotel. We were delighted to find that it is as lovely and friendly as ever. The hotel is right on a small reefed beach that is enjoyed by locals and tourists alike. The Hau Tree restaurant is right next to the sand and the sea, shaded by the trees. The trees are quite old and have a history as does the hotel.We booked into a Ocean Diamond Head deluxe room, and we were glad we splurged. Our large balcony overlooked Kapilani Park and the ocean with the Waikiki skyline in the distance. The scene in the park was ever changing: from exercises groups in the morning to families setting up for the day with tents and barbeques. The homeless were there as well with chairs and tents. No camping is allowed overnight and that seems somewhat enforced. They were quite friendly though and didn’t seem to create a problem during the day. We loved the park. A short walk brings you to the edge of the Waikiki hotel area, but it is nice being a bit away from the more built up area.We had breakfast every morning in the Hau Tree restaurant. In the evening we got take-out and sat on our balcony for dinner. One night we had a urge for some tsukemono (the Japanese picked vegetables). I went up to the fancy Miyako restaurant to see if I could get a plate to go. They could not have been nicer or more welcoming. They made up a special plate for us that was absolutely delicious.During our stay we did the Wednesday morning walking tour (2 hours) of the China Town area. We would highly recommend that tour. The history of the area is fascinating.We look forward to returning to the Kaimana Beach Hotel.","Oakland, California","slamb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland, California</strong>",3,5.0

It's a 15 minute walk to the east end of Waikiki (ABC store and Starbucks) and the zoo, past the aquarium. There is a beachfront cafe half way to Waikiki that is OK. There are Japanese tour groups that come in for breakfast. Parking: get ready to pay $24. a day for valet parking. Pretty stiff, but again the location is really nice, and it doesn't take long to figure out the way into the hotel (one way street right in front.)

Also, you can get back on the highway to go to downtown HNL and Pearl Harbor WEST, etc, from Fifth Street However, going West bound from Hanauma Bay you would want to take exit to the right for the Kahala area, then go left and down around Diamond Head to the South to get back to the hotel, or you will find yourself in Waikiki again, as you cannot exit off Sixth Street going WEST, if you are already on the highway.",Vaorbust,"Sophia K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vaorbust</strong>",39,4.0

I would call the Kaimana beach area the quiet end of Waikiki. Still, with all the activity in Kapiolani park, the area is very active. Waikiki while fun, can feel like a tourist trap when you are in the heart of it. It is an easy walk to get into the thick of Waikiki from the New Otani, but then you get to retreat to the more local feeling Kaimana Beach/Kapiolani Park area. Right at the foot of world famous Diamond Head, it's a short trip to the Diamond Head look out for a stunning ocean view, and it's also very close to the Diamond Head Visitors center and crater rim walk.The hotel is right on the beach and it is a short walk to board rentals if you fancy some surfing or water activity. The small but engaging Honolulu Aquarium is practically next door, and the Honolulu Zoo is an easy walk as well.

It's an urban beach and the hotels are always really hard to choose. Many hotels are old and not renovated, as is the New Otani. What sets this hotel apart is its location, which cannot be better if you crave to be out of hectic Waikiki, but not as far off as the north shore. The bad:It's an old hotel. It's in bad need of renovation in many areas, the lobby and restaurant, the elevators, and the institutional hallways. Sadly, this is the norm in Waikiki and not unusual. There is no pool. There is a laundry room, but it's small and dirty. The room rates are really astronomical considering these flaws. Parking is $24 a day and valet only. There are no beach chairs to lend or rent, only straw mats. We were surprised that the hotel didn't have more small touches in the room, like a bottle opener. The housekeeping was spotty and I had to request that the floors be vacuumed twice. I don't think they changed the sheets the entire week we were there. Dust built up. The turn down service never included a change of glasses. The good:The views are unbeatable! The recently renovated rooms are completely comfortable and spacious. The balcony and balcony furniture are comfortable and relaxing. The front desk and valet service is good. The beach it's located on is lovely and cannot be compared to Waikiki. We had a washlet in our bathroom (something we Japanese residents love). Besides the occasional noise associated with it's location next to the park it's balanced with the location being so green and open. It was my first visit to the New Otani, and I could return but I'm not sure. Considering the price of $360 ++ per night for our room category, plus the parking, plus the high food costs, and the relatively depressing state of the facilities outside the room, I will definitely be thinking twice.","Tokyo, Japan","TokyoShirokuma</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",201,4.0

Outside that the rooms are lovely, well serviced and come with delightful L'Occitane products. We stayed in room 610 and 612 (family room adjoining via a balcony) at $478 plus tax making it $545 per night for the Ocean, Waikiki, Diamond Head Deluxe and Ocean Waikiki Superior. Compared to some hotels in the city end the rooms, view and size were exponentially better. Room service or food at the restaurant was pricey so we shared a $17 fruit platter or bought from the local ABC shops (granola, yoghurt and fruit) making the stay much more affordable. The views are to die for, from the ocean alongside the beach and park, and all if Waikiki to Diamond head. It's about 15 minutes walk at a slow pace to the bustle and noise and crowds of the main drag in Waikiki, which is actually great as you get a bit of exercise in. If you walk the opposite way, you get to Diamond Head state park in 45 minutes, and a further 45 minutes see you hiked up the summit to look down over the hotel and Waikiki. Not to mention the walk is past some lovely mansions! We even saw humpback whales in the distance. All in all good value, service and surroundings.

While the room we had was quite small, the bed was very comfortable and we had a view of both the ocean and Diamond Head from our private balcony. We had a great breakfast at the Lau Tree Lanai which is right on the beach. It is very busy so reservations are a good idea. There is a small general store on the property which was convenient and a good place to get coffee in the morning and then head out to the private beach. The beach was quiet and never over crowded, it was a great way to start the day. I would definitely stay there again.","Monument, Colorado, United States","Patti N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Monument, Colorado, United States</strong>",4,4.0

Consistency, beauty, grace to name a few. This wonderful property never fails to delight, from the first view of the open-air lobby and ocean beyond, the never failing cheerfulness of the staff, and the feeling of being a million miles away from the chaos and sheer number of people in downtown Waikiki.The location, at the foot of Diamond Head, yet only 10 minutes walking time from ground-zero Honolulu, is one of the biggest blessings of this property. Oh....that and the beach in front of the hotel. San Souci Beach is one of the nicest stretches of sand in the city, and yes it can seem crowded at times. The difference is that the crowds here are mostly locals and families out for a day on the sand, and the beautiful bodies of visiting military men and ""professional"" women showing off. Thus the local name of the beach; ""Dig Me Beach"", as in hey! Dig me....I'm worth looking at. The water is crystal clear with a gentle slope out to some coral reef with good snorkeling.Having undergone a recent multi million dollar room renovation, the suites are small but perfect in a Japanese-austere fashion. The best rooms are the #17 rooms, ocean view deluxe corner units with wrap-around glass walls and lanais that look down on the beach and downtown Honolulu, AND have amazing sunset views. Expensive? Yup. But totally worth it","Lopez Island, Washington","islandjavaguy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lopez Island, Washington</strong>",24,5.0

The layout looks more like a motel.the walls need painting and quite bare. A few cheap paintings would help the aesthetics. The basic room is just that. 1970's looking and small. The view is not bad with diamond head to the left and the beach around the corner on the right. Breakfast is expensive. A buffet would work better. The access to the beach is great.

We recommend heading in for a drink or lunch at the Beach Bar at the Moana Surfrider, a beautiful setting at this historic hotel.It's worth having a meal at the New Otani's Hau Tree Lanai restaurant, on the terrace overlooking the beach. We also have enjoyed the hotel bar and the Japanese restaurant in the hotel.

There are coffee shops in Waikiki as well as the ABC Stores selling snacks along with the souvenirs. Easiest of all is to buy coffee, fruit and yogurt at Russell's Convenience Store right at the corner of the hotel. Our rooms always had a refrigerator.Instead of heading towards Waikiki, you can walk in the other direction towards Diamond Head. There are a couple of small oceanfront parks before you reach the Diamond Head Lighthouse, where you can walk down a steep hill to the beach or stay up above and look down on the surfers.The service at the hotel was excellent. We had a rental car, and the valet sprinted to retrieve it. We were greeted everytime we walked through the lobby.

The walk is a consideration as it is a reasonable distance to Waikiki during the day the weather is quite hot and at night the area attracts homeless or people that sleep in their cars or in tents right along the footpath. There are no camping signs in the park but the roadside grass must be exempt so that is where everyone is. I mention this not as a criticism of the hotel but I wouldn't have been keen on walking back at night without my husband, of course a taxi would eliminate this problem but sometimes it would have been nice just to have something close by. I was impressed by the beach, it was clean, the water was nice and the hotel blocked the sun in parts so there was shade available, the hotel has beach chairs for $5.00 a day and provides towels. As for the room after much consideration we chose a room on the higher floors one of the corner ones with a view of both the beach and Waikiki and booked it a couple of months prior. Upon arrival we were told that for an extra $80 per night we could upgrade to suite with a view, this came as a surprise given that I had booked a room with a view. I whipped out my paperwork and showed the check in person what room I had booked, she looked a bit thrown and nothing more was said. Once we got to the room it seemed we had been put in the suite anyway, I can only assume that they overbook the rooms and sort it out later trying to get some more $$ from people. I can't compare the room we had to what we had booked as I didn't see the other, it was direct oceanfront but not on the corner. The suite had dated decor, probably late 80's early 90's nice sitting area and big bathroom and closet. Jacuzzi didn't work at all just made noise, the bed was large and comfortable and the bathroom products were good quality. I wish now that I had insisted on the room I had booked as I believe they had been renovated, before I booked I read a review that spoke of a similar circumstance at check in so maybe that is how they do things. I rated the hotel as ""average"" as I felt ""very good"" did not apply, average seems harsh I would say it was good in that the location is good if you want quiet, the rooms were clean and as it was my first time in Oahu I can't compare to another hotel. If I were to go there again I would probably try another hotel to be closer to amenities, if I were to stay here again I would go for one of the cheaper rooms, whilst I did not see inside the diamond head wing it is located right on the small park and probably represents good value for money. Did not eat at the hotel restaurant but I can say it was always very well patronised and bookings are needed, the hotel bar is very small located at the end of the lobby. I should also mention that the hotel very kindly allowed us use of a room after check out to have a shower and get changed as we had a late flight, this was a nice touch and very helpful.","Cairns, Australia","gabysue</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cairns, Australia</strong>",45,3.0

There is no pool nor accommodations for beach goers who want more than a tatami mat and beach towel to perch upon. Between hotel errors on reserved bedding configuration and a rather horrid plumbing problem (who knew shower drains could disgorge such stuff) we have now seen 4 different rooms in 24 hours. At this hotel, rooms are not created equal. It is an old property with aging physical plant and wide quality differences between rooms. By all means, book a corner, ocean-view room on a high floor. The property is Japanese-owned and caters especially to Asian tourists. (Better rooms have toilets with built-in bidet functions.)We're here for a conference otherwise would not have chosen this brand or location.

Bed comfortable, nice view across park and Diamond Head from balcony. Air con a bit noisy, but kept us cool. Can't say much else about the hotel facilities because we tended to leave early in the morning and not get back again 'til evening, so never really made any use of them. Made it back in time for sunset a couple of times, which was very nice from the hotels beach. The walk into town only took 10 minutes, or so. As has been said elsewhere, you will pass an awful lot of homeless people on that walk. We stuck to the brightest lit paths and never had any issues, but can't say we felt entirely comfortable through some sections. Our rental car was small, basic and old, so we had no concerns about leaving it on the street and making use of the free overnight parking. I was fortunately able to park under streetlights less than 100 yards from the hotel - could see car from balcony. No issues at all.We enjoyed our stay.

We found the hotel staff quite distant, particular in the bar (which was like a morgue most of the time), not particularly welcoming or helpful. It lacked warmth, character and was not enjoyable for us being there. We walked to the main shops and restaurants every evening but was not comfortable with all the homeless people around. The walk was about 15 mins. The beach was nice but without sunbeds or parasols it was uncomfortable staying there for a long period of time. We were surprised to see so many dogs on the beach.

This was my 6th time to Oahu, 3rd time to stay in this hotel, and 2nd time to stay in this same room. I was pleasantly surprised to find that since I stayed here in 2011, the room has been further updated. There is now a granite countertop on the sink and new tile in the bathroom. The old wallpaper has been ripped off, and new paint applied. There are new fixtures, carpeting and bedding. All in all the room is much more inviting and pleasing to the eye. My only complaint, is there is absolutely no artwork...not even any cheap travel prints. I would stick a couple of pictures on the walls of palm trees or something to make it more homey. The main common areas of the hotel are still very much out-dated, but with the open air lobby and interior....you can kinda overlook that. :-) Obviously, the view from the balcony of the ocean and the city is still spectacular. This time my neighbors were quiet, so rested wonderfully. Also, compared to previous stays at this hotel, the staff was much more pleasant. I guess it depends on who is working. They still make you pay to print your boarding pass, (what a rip-off, so just checked in with my i-phone, and then printed the boarding pass at the airport). The bar is still more expensive than any others on the strip, (11.00 for a mai-tai), and the convenience store is still more expensive than the ABC stores...but, knowing all of this, I planned accordingly and tried not to dine or shop at the New Otani stores. I still had to request a coffee maker, which seems odd that this is standard in every other hotel I stay in. And, the ironing board is one of those ""dorm sized"" things....granted the hotel literature said you can request coffee makers and a full sized ironing board...but, why not just provide one already?Also odd, is the in room safe. It locked and everything...but, it was not bolted to anything. I literally could pick it up....so if someone had the inclination...they could see it was locked, and know that is where I put my valuables, and just walk away with it.....very strange.....so, New Otani...please permanently bolt the safes in the room.Regarding Honolulu, the poor WWI monument Natatorium is still in a state of disrepair, and is an eye-sore. It is my understanding that they may be tearing this grand old structure down, instead of rehabbing it...what a shame....and, what an insult to the military, that this honor to them has suffered this fate.Also, disappionting is the number of homeless people in the city. I have been coming here for 10 years, and the number of homeless has increased probably 10 fold in that time. Where there once were a few in the Kapiolani Park, there are now dozens camped out, ignoring the no tent and no loitering signs. As I ran nearly every morning I was there, I passed by the exact same group of homeless camped out under the structure in front of the Natatorium. They had sleeping bags on the ground and benches, various food and alcohol lined up on the wall behind them. They were always there, each morning....obviously loitering. Also I noticed a group of 3 men permanently camped out in front of the Starbucks every day, on the major corner below Lulu's...just on the sidewalk with their shopping carts and sleeping bag...one even had a sleeping bag on a blow up air floatie. I am not sure what can be done about this....and we do need to be compassionate to their plight... Currently, I enjoy staying in Waikiki, and driving to the other side of the island during the day....however, with all of the homeless...I am now toying with the idea of staying on the other side of the island...and just driving a couple of times into Waikiki. From what I read, the city says they are cracking down on the homeless population...but, obviously this is just lip service, when you see the exact same people loitering in the exact same spot for 6 days in a row.So, the hotel has updated the rooms. It is an older hotel, and has not been gutted to the studs...or restored to its original character....so, it is not going to be a 5 star property, if that is what you are seeking. But, it is nice. It is clean. The views are spectacular. This time the staff were pleasant. And, this time my neighbors were quiet. Having it's own beach is nice, and the beach is far less crowded than those on the other side of Waikiki. The beach seems to draw more locals, and that is fun.

It contains the most economical rooms - Diamond Head Wing Studio, Diamond Head Wing One Bedroom, Diamond Head Wing Park View One Bedroom. When choosing numbers suggest using the official website of the hotel, which is narrated in detail illustrated with every hotel room. Of course, taking a room in the main building only.

Every morning, many Japanese come here for breakfast on buses and taxis. As I understand, the place is very popular and well known.

It's located next to Kapiolani Park so parking can be tricky! I chose valet. They unloaded everything, including my SUP and stored it for me. Love that convenience!Keep in mind this is an older hotel. The room we stayed in...323...is nothing to boast about but it was clean! The direct view was of the parking lot and a couple of REALLY close by hotels. But to the right was a sliver of beach, ocean & palm trees. Although I had hoped for a view of the Natatorium, No matter, we just needed to sleep. For our needs it was perfect. Just a queen bed, t.v., fridge, and safe. Bathroom was clean and for the deal ($159/night) was just what we needed. There is no pool and the restaurant ""Hau Tree"" (I think) is quite pricey. The room service was great! Not only timely but Fresh fruit, perfectly cooked eggs and bacon, fresh coffee!! I would definitely stay again with the right deal!

However, when I got to my room and found it newly redone, elegant and quiet, it made everything much better. I have nothing but good things to say about the room. It was truly elegant and modern, and the view was absolutely fantastic, with a great vista of the Pacific Ocean, Waikiki Beach, and Honolulu and the Oahu shoreline all the way down to Kapolei! I was very happy with the fact that the insolation was such that it was nearly completely quiet, and in fact the only noises you heard were from the screaming kids on the beach. Perhaps had I been on a higher floor (and maybe someone could tell me how one can be assigned a higher floor) that might have been better, although even when you heard the sounds from the beach they weren't terribly awful or intrusive. Perhaps I should mention that we were there over the Independence Day Holiday, so I probably shouldn't complain. At other Waikiki hotels it would have been MUCH worse. The bed was very nice, and although I have a lot of back and leg pain when I sleep on most beds (including my own), this bed gave me total comfort and a very good night's sleep. The TV (after I had to ask twice to have it made operational) was very good, a nice big, flat screen. The bathroom amenities were really nice, although I sort of expect a Toto ""washlet"" toilet from a Japanese hotel (this was a Toto toilet, but had no washlet features). The bathtub was just barely big enough, but it was okay. I asked for room service twice, and the first time they didn't get all of my order. They forgot the bagel and refused to give me the bagel they actually had. Why another guest should have gotten that one is beyond me. They were very polite about it, and the room service was timely and very friendly, and the food was good.I was put off by the fact that there was no coffee/tea maker in the room. If you asked for it, you were provided with it, and it came in a timely manner, but I've gotten used to the fact that they are usually provided in the top hotels.We had dinner at the Hau Tree Lanai, the hotel's restaurant, and the location (right on the beach) was nice, and it had a very laid-back ambience, so you didn't necessarily expect four-star service, and the service was friendly, accommodating and helpful. The food was just okay, and although I wouldn't compare it to a five-star restaurant, it was what you might expect at a beach eatery.The hotel has no pool or hot tub, and if you're expecting that don't reserve here. The beach is very nice, with that magnificent view of Waikiki, and I enjoyed watching the surfers, paddle surfers and outrigger paddlers throughout my stay. I was there over Independence Day, so on the 4th the beach was just totally packed with people, and although it was sort of fun watching from the lanai, I don't think I'd find it particularly pleasant or peaceful to laze on the beach. It was nice being on the lanai, though.If I had one main gripe about my stay it's that I wasn't given a higher floor, even though I had requested one months in advance. I don't know what you have to do to get a higher floor, but even trying to tempt the desk clerk with a nice tip (this on advice from a book about how to improve your stay in a hotel) I had no luck. But I've had this kind of experience in New Otani hotels in Tokyo. They're oh so very polite, but if they don't want to give you something you could just as well be talking to a brick wall.So in conclusion, let me say that the (refurbished) rooms are very nice and pleasant, but the rest of the hotel could definitely use a facelift. The employees could work on being a little more pleasant and accommodating. In order for me to give this hotel anything more than ""average"" a lot of work will have to be done.","Kaneohe, Hawaii","Whitsiepoo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kaneohe, Hawaii</strong>",164,3.0

Rooms are not lavishly sized but well-planned and comfortable, with lanais overlooking either the park, beachfront, or Diamond Head; the bathrooms could use updating but are perfectly functional. Beds are soft (a bit much so for my taste) and linens and toiletry amenities are somewhat sub-par; there is a refrigerator but no mini-bar. There is, however, plentiful storage space and the closet contains two luggage racks to make unpacking easier. There is no pool or fitness center, which might be a deterrent to some; but the beach is what you come to Waikiki for, and the hotel offers mats as well as towels for sunbathing comfort. The Hau Tree Lanai – an open-air beachfront restaurant shaded by twin giant hau trees – serves a delicious breakfast, which is highly popular with visiting Japanese tour groups, so be warned and reserve ahead of time; we were out at lunch and dinner every day, so didn't sample menus for those times.

Even when we showed up in the lobby with our suitcases 40 minutes after we checked in (there was no way I was going to spend even one night in that room) no one asked if there was anything they could do.

The location is perfect if you want Ocean views, but not right in the crazy hustle and bustle on downtown Waikiki . You are only a 10 to 15 minutes’ walk away along the pretty beach front or beautiful park to downtown, so it’s best of both worlds here. The hotel is right on the San Souci beach as is their restaurant. The staff are family like and that is all part of the charm of this hotel that gives it its personality and character. From the Valet to the reception, everyone is helpful. It's obvious talking to a few other regular guest that once you’ve stayed here you won’t want to stay anywhere else. Why would you with views and a location like this. The rooms are currently having a makeover and I started my vacation in their basic room not yet refurbished, which was amazing value for the money. Really good views of Diamond Head and I could see the ocean, plus free in room internet, what more could you want. I’ve had to work a few days from my room while here, so I asked if I could get a better room. The lady on reception went out of her way and for a very reasonable price. I got one of their amazing deluxe beach front refurbished room with a wraparound lanai and breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean and the Waikiki skyline, which at sunset is memorable sitting on your own private Lanai. Then to wake up to sunrise over Diamond Head as the first rays hit the Pacific, it’s the perfect honeymoon location. I can confirm the photos are very accurate, which is a nice surprise compared to other hotels I’ve stayed at. I really don’t understand why this hotel is not in the top 10 on Tripadvisor for Waikik. I stayed at a hotel right next door last year which is highly ranked and yet the Kaimana Beach beats it for views, service, and room quality (refurbished rooms). I can’t recommend it enough.

The smaller beach (san souci ithink its called) is much less crowded and has a lifeguard so safety is not an issue.

When we arrived on 15 May we checked in and went straight to our room so we could get settled in and make our way out for supper. When we returned my girlfriend noticed that there were small ants crawling all over the kitchenette area. When we looked closer we noticed that the ants were also in the bathroom and in a few places around the bed. We went to the front desk and explained the situation to the clerk. He offered us another room in the main tower for the night and said they would spray the room in the morning so we could move back in for the next night of our visit. The next morning we talked to the manager on duty and she was aware of the situation. She explained that the staff could spray to get rid of the ants and would move our belongings back in afterward. We headed out for the day and returned shortly before supper. At first everything seemed to be ok and we didn't notice any ants. However after we had gone out for supper and returned we once again noticed that there were ants in the room as with the previous night. We once again went to the front desk where the manager on duty assigned us to a different room in the same wing. In both cases the rooms we were moved to were upgrades from our original room. However the upgraded rooms do not take away from the fact that we should not have had to move in the first place. For the price I paid for the room I would expect that something like an ant infestation would have been handled before someone moved into the room. I have had less problems while staying at an Econolodge. It was also frustrating in that we were there for 2 nights and were not in the same room either night or in the room that I had booked either night. I would have expected to be moved after the first night to an equivalent room for the duration of our stay. With the exception of the person on duty at the desk the first night, who made us feel like it was our fault, all other staff we dealt with at the hotel were very pleasant and eager to help.

The beach in front of the hotel is perfect (I brought my own towel and beach chair) with a lifeguard, and Waikiki is an easy 10 minute walk along the water.The poi pancakes at the Hau Tree Lanai are the best breakfast treat - better than the French toast or the Eggs Benedict. For dinner, try the Ahi Salad Nicoise - delicious and well priced. For good, less expensive food, take a short walk past the Aquarium to the Barefoot Beach Cafe - try the garlic shrimp plate (just like you find on the shrimp trucks around the island) for lunch.Dined at Michel's for memories - dinner was nice, wonderful setting, but my best meal was at Alan Wong's. Try the Passion Fruit Mojito - best cocktail ever! The service was vey attentive and the food features local, fresh ingredients.","Los Angeles, CA","nubusniesstrvlr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong>",42,5.0

It looks like a 1960s-era hotel (and some of the maintenance shows) but its location away from the main strip of Waikiki Beach is a huge plus.The hotel is about 10 minutes or so level walking from the main strip of Waikiki Beach – a good stroll, a safe neighbourhood, and a short taxi ride if you really cannot walk this. Well worth being away from the racket and noise of the main strip.The open bar and restaurant area was a pleasant way to get one’s land-legs back after the flight from Australia, even if the maître d was a little bit short. The bellman allegedly helping us with luggage then slammed the door in my wife’s face as we struggled up the stairs in the apartment wing (above the shops). Maybe they had heard that Australians are reputed to be terrible tippers. Other staff were very pleasant, and uniformly helpfulWe chose a 1-bedroom apartment, with a TINY kitchenette and no work desk but otherwise spacious. We had our own basic kitchen implements which, together with my skills in microwave cookery, had us self-catering when we weren’t eating out. The room overlooked the adjacent park.Several maintenance issues with the room – loose power outlets, eccentric microwave oven (only worked if we closed the door a certain way), and TV remotes that were really simply fancy paperweights. But most were addressed when reported (except the microwave – we received lessons on how to close the door).No noise problems that we experienced, and a lovely spot on top of the beach. Lovely for a dip or for just strolling and watching the sunset.Now be warned; this is NOT a business hotel, This is reflected in the absence of a business centre and work desk in room, and in (initially) the rather laid-back way they initially treated our complaint regarding the very slow wi fi. A technician did a drive-by assessment and determined the wi fi was working; our problem was that it was not working properly. The hotel finally had the problem assessed properly, and indeed found that the wi fi was indeed not working properly. But by that stage I was 4 days behind in my work.But if you are after a vacation or a nice stopover to or from mainland USA / Australia, then this is certainly the place to be.","Adelaide, Australia","lysurgis23</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",40,4.0

It literally takes seven minutes to walk from the hotel to Waikiki Beach. It is super quiet and has an awesome beach right in front of the hotel. It is also within walking distance to the Aquarium, which is also a nice little feature. We had a room on the seventh floor overlooking the park, with views of the ocean and wonderful Honolulu sunsets and skyline views. It was superb and very relaxing. This hotel is owned by a Japanese company, so they do cater to a TON of Japanese tourists, so we were definitely in the minority here. But they are all very nice and friendly and treat all guests extremely well. I am beginning to have more of an appreciation for the smaller boutique style hotels of the world as they have to compete with very large companies and seem to do all of the little things better than the larger places. This place does everything right and also has a fantastic restaurant on-site, Hau Tree Lanai, which gets super busy because it is probably the closest you will ever come to dining right ON the beach in Honolulu and has wonderful food and great service. It is a little on the pricey side, but everything in Hawaii is expensive, just know that before you go there. The staff here is exceptional and I would DEFINITELY stay here again. The only downside for some people might be that they do not have a swimming pool, but their beach is right out front and it's very calm and excellent for swimming. If you go out further, you will be swimming with turtles. Beautiful place, beautiful people.

The proximity to the park and the beach promenade toward Waikiki, make it ideal for access to walks and jogging. The downside naturally to the distance from Waikiki is less choice of restaurants in the immediate vicinity. The hotel restaurant is very good and offers a beautiful intimate setting for sunset dinners or breakfast. They are well known for their eggs benedict selections. My wife and I live in Honolulu and just spent an overnight anniversary celebration. We stayed in their smallest oceanview room which was compact but not unreasonably small.

My main focus was to visit the Arizona Memorial and other museums of Pearl Harbor. I'm very pleased I choose the New Otani over many other hotels with ""better deals"" on Waikiki Beach! The hotel is with in walking distance to the busy ""Las Vegas"" atmosphere of the strip. But felt miles away because of the green space provided by Kapiolani Park. I'll admit it I'm not a Waikiki type vacationer. So it was nice to have some green space and ocean around the hotel instead of shopping malls. The New Otani sits on a perfect little beach with an outer reef that protects it from the main swell-great swimming beach for families. There is a channel in the reef that leads out to offshore breakers so one can have the best of both ocean conditions right at your doorstep. I also found it fun and interesting to walk around Diamond Head Crater Park-watching the surfers on the coast and strolling thru nice neighborhoods made for a great walk.We stayed in a series 17 room (full ocean view) and felt it was well worth the splurge. The only downside to this hotel is the lack of a swimming pool (guess that is what the ocean is for!) and gym. There is small gym with kinda worn equipment on the property next door that one can access for $15 a day-run on the beach or in the park instead.","Wrangell, Alaska","Johnisupdariver</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wrangell, Alaska</strong>",29,4.0

You have to pay the Hawaii premium to vacation here and it's not really fair to compare accommodations in Hawaii to anywhere else in the world. It's like New York City. If you want to go there, you have to pay the price. We stayed in a Ocean View Superior Room. Half the hotel with ocean view is renovated and I believe other half is not. If you are going all the way to Hawaii, pay the price and get the ocean view. It's worth it. The room was narrow and long with a mud room/foyer but spacious overall. Nice size bathroom and living area. There was a small couch for two (more like one) but you don't go to Hawaii to lounge and watch TV. It's hard to say whether the extra $$ for the corner room is worth it or not. From our balcony, we could see Waikiki beach so I think it was ok for us.The best thing about this hotel is the location. It's about 15 minute walk to the southern tip of the Waikiki strip. Also, you can find street parking (valet parking is quite expensive) over night and we were there over Thanksgiving weekend so we didn't have to feed the meter when we went walking about in Wakiki.

When reserving, I requested an updated room overlooking the ocean. It was basic, but clean and very pleasant.The rooms on the other side looked dated, but still clean. Although there have been some unfavorable reviews about the park, noise, cleanliness and staff problems, we found none of this. It's right on a public beach/park, not a private area, so there will be some noise. All of it died down by 9:00 pm every night, which was more than acceptable. You literally walk out the back door onto a nice, sheltered beach area without the crowded conditions on Waikiki. The staff including housekeeping, bell desk, check-in, valet, activities desk and restaurant were all more than helpful and seemed to care about our stay. The housekeeper kept missing (or not taking) my tips, I had to follow her down the hall once and she seemed reluctant to take it. I think if you treat the staff respectfully, you'll be treated well in return. The air conditioner was a new Mr. Slim which was super quiet and easy to operate, none of that annoying A/C rattling keeping you awake even at high-end hotels. The room was somewhat small, but what do you need when you're spending all of your time out of doors, swimming and hiking? Some people sitting next to us in the restaurant owned a condo down the street and said that they recommend this hotel to their friends and family. A woman we met in the elevator said she had just checked out of a noisy, loud resort by the Waikiki beach and was hoping the New Otani Kaimana was quiet. This is not a resort and it is very basic, however, it was exactly what we were looking for - when we walked down to the Waikiki beach area, it was a cluster ruckus with horrendous traffic, and we were so glad we stayed right on the San Souci beach. If you're looking for perks and updated resort amenities, this is definitely not the place for you. If you want a clean, basic room with great ocean views, sunsets and an uncrowded beach, this is where to go. Check out Leonards, Rainbow Cafe, Diamondhead Beach Club, and the beach restaurant between the New Otani and Waikiki for reasonably priced, excellent food.Rainbow and Diamondhead Beach Club are both outdoor restaurants -- if there's no picnic tables available, you can always take it to your room and eat on the lanai.

The hotel has done extensive renovations to its lobby bar, and guest rooms bringing it up to date with a fresh modern sense, and little touches of aloha. I have been to Waikiki several times, and this is a definite favourite hotel for me. It is located on the far side of the Kapilolani Park, away from all the noise and congestion of the main Waikiki area. It is a beautiful ten minute stroll to the main Waikiki area. (If you prefer the sounds of party people screaming at night, or the sounds of the garbage trucks at 7:00 in the morning, I suggest you stay in the main Waikiki area). At the New Otani, I had an excellent room which was tastefully appointed, and very spacious. My lanai wrapped around the room, so that I could see Diamond Head on one side and the whole of Waikiki and the ocean on the other. By day or by night, I was always finding myself staring out at the spectacular view. Housekeeping was excellent and my bed, was very comfortable- which is the most important thing. At night I slept with the curtains open to marvel the view, and the lanai doors open so I could listen to the ocean waves and wind wrestling the palm trees. It was truly a treat!I am a runner and swimmer, and I just needed to step out the door and I was on my way up to Kahala for a daily run, without having to weave through the crowds in the main area. The Sans Souci beach outside of the hotel, also gives guests an almost ""private beach"" feeling, and one can easily swim out to a marker for a nice workout. There isn't a swimming pool at the hotel, but you don't need it as there is little surf at the beach outside the hotel. Surfers are also in abundance in the area as there are some great waves off shore. They even have a storage area for boards at the hotel.I dined in the Hau Tree Lanai restaurant at the hotel a couple of times, and you do need reservations to dine there, as it is a very popular destination for both locals and tourists...and the foods are excellent. I had the Kaimana Eggs Benedict one day which everyone else around me was eating and it was done to perfection.On another visit, I had a salmon dish done in a miso sauce, the portion and presentation was perfect and the salmon perfectly done. Whether staying at the hotel or not, I would suggest this restaurant, as it is literally right on the beach, dining under the tree provides a very special atmosphere. Apparently the restaurant will often get sold out for weddings and other special events as well.There are not many shops in the area, but the hotel does have a small arcade with a convenience store (alcohol, produce, snacks and sundries); hair salon, and a couple of other specialized shops. So one does not have to go too far. There is also a spa in the hotel, which I never used, and the Kaiseki Japanese Restaurant, Miyako- with chefs direct from Japan!The hotel also has free WIFI throughout the building, which is a great plus. Many of the other hotels in the area only offer this in the lobby, or end up charging you for this. I did manage to meet with the General Manager as well, who informed me that the hotel is going to continue renovating a lot of the hotel, and I assured him to keep up the great work as I would again be back. I have stayed at several hotels in the area, from low end to high end, but find myself returning to this gem. Would I recommend it? YES, in a heartbeat. It has everything you need and more.","Vancouver, BC","1IslandGuy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, BC</strong>",49,5.0

For me, this is true escapism.If you feel the same way, you want to check into the New Otani, a Pacific retreat in the shade of Diamond Head, just minutes away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, on Kaimana Beach.

Open the windows and let in a soft breeze.Round sweeping balconies are perfect for star gazing at night. Or for watching the play of lights up the mountainside.During the day, kiss away an afternoon on the balcony with your favorite novel. Or order a bottle of sparkling wine and chill out on the chaise longue.The coma-inducing bed allows for some wonderful naps in between island tours.Cool tiles in the bathroom soothe after a day on the beach. A pleasant surprise was a supply of full body towels and the scented bath soaps.Troll the lobby for some excellent people watching. Or wander over to the lobby-level bar fora mai tai or your favorite tropical drink.A convenience store on site was a welcome relief for late night snacks and drinks.The multi-lingual staff will attend to your every need, including room service when you want to order in, and scented flowers on your pillow when turning down your bed for the night.The New Otani is well placed for park strolls, or the occasional jog to shred those extra pounds.Insider tip: Book a room higher up so you can get a better view of Waikiki Beach and the mountains in the distance.It's perfectly understandable if you feel like crying when you leave the warmth of this resort.","Comox, Canada","billyp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Comox, Canada</strong>",53,5.0

I'd recommend The New Otani as long as you don't require a full service hotel (which oddly enough we usually do but here the pros outweigh the cons!).We decided to stay at the New Otani based on friends recommendation and Trip Advisor reviews & were VERY happy with our choice. The location is good as it’s not in the craziness and hustle/bustle of the crammed hotels concentrated in downtown Waikiki.The hotel is located right on Sans-souci beach which felt like a locals hang-out (which we liked) and is short walk to the downtown Waikiki. Something important to note is this is NOT a full service hotel (i.e. not round the clock room service and no pool) but the views of the Pacific, Diamond Head and downtown Waikiki more than make up for it!We were lucky enough to be upgraded to the Waikiki suite and the suite was FANTASTIC . This is a corner suite with views from all the windows, a large balcony with lounge chairs, and everything about the room makes you feel like you are truly on a great vacation. We invited our group of 6 over for the sunset cocktails as its a perfect setting.We had dinner one night in Miyako - the Japanese restaurant at the hotel which is very good - I would HIGHLY recommend making a reservations for one of the cabanas on the balcony and get there in time for the sunset - a GORGEOUS view. We were a group of 8 and each of us liked our dishes and the we had a great waitress. We also had a breakfast and dinner at the Hau Tree Lanai which is the lobby/ beachfront restaurant - it's a very charming setting underneath the ancient Hau trees.Remember when making a reservation to ask for Ocean view (depending on your budget) - we originally made a reservation for a room with Ocean & Diamond Head views - the combo is beautiful!","New York City, New York","Craig K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",40,5.0

We were upgraded to an Ocean View Deluxe room with an amazing panorama along Waikiki (and beyond towards Eva Beach) and out over the Pacific. Although the room was rather small, the scenery from our balcony more than made up for this fact. The open-air lobby is especially welcoming, and includes a bar for afternoon/evening drinks and snacks. We also tried one of the two restaurants on site (Hau Tree Lanai). The hotel is situated at the Diamond Head (east) end of Waikiki across from Kapiolani Park and near the base of Diamond Head. Accordingly, the neighborhood is quieter and less congested than the heart of Waikiki further to the west. There is a decent beach with good snorkeling right in front of the hotel (Sans Souci Beach). Due to its location, it is about a 15-20 minute walk to many restaurants and other hotels in Waikiki. However, the hotel is also more accessible to less touristed local (and less expensive) restaurants on Kapahulu and Monserrat Avenues. The concierge desk and valets were also especially helpful in providing restaurant reservations and driving directions during our stay.","Scottsdale, Arizona","Peter M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scottsdale, Arizona</strong>",12,5.0

Concerning hotels, the problem with Honolulu is that the great majority of them are concentrated in Waikiki. And concentration is indeed THE problem here. Waikiki is a ghetto, a fancy and expensive one but a ghetto nonetheless. Yet the area just outside of Waikiki is actually very pleasant: Kapi'olani beach park, Sans-sourcing beach, the park going toward Diamond Head, etc... So what to do? Should one get stuck in Waikiki just so one could enjoy these areas? I tried that one year and it was terrible. The traffic jams, the overpriced parking fees, the overwhelming concrete, the list goes one. Thankfully, there is one solution to this conundrum. And that is The New Otani Kaimana. The hotel is located right on Sans-souci beach. In fact there is a door behind the reception desk that takes one directly to the sand. The view toward Waikiki at night is gorgeous. If one gets tired of Sans-souci, Kapi'olani is only a short walk away, essentially on the other side of the Natatorium. Then if one really wanted to go immerse oneself in the ugliness of Waikiki, that would only take a bit of a longer walk. Finally, there is yet another immense advantage. Parking can easily be done on the street right in front of the hotel. Starting late afternoon (7PM?) until 10AM, street parking is free at the meters facing the hotel. After 10AM, it's 50 cents per hour. So with just a bit of planning, parking at this hotel is essentially free. Compare that to the rip-off prices in Waikiki, something like $20 per day and more.Room. This hotel was built in the sixties and it shows. There is not much to the architecture. It's plain, not to say ugly. Some may say the cluster of buildings in this neighborhood takes a lot away from the beauty of Diamond Head in the background. Luckily, the rooms have all been refreshed. The bathroom is spacious and the new fittings and furniture make it quite attractive and comfortable. The balcony, equipped with lounge chairs is a great place to relax. The couch and coffee table make for a functional, spacious place. The fridge comes empty but I like it that as I always buy my own things and it's nice not to have to compete for space with the usual overpriced stuff that hotels put into their fridges.Food. I heard the Japanese restaurant at this hotel is very good but I did not get a chance to eat there. I did eat breakfast one morning at the Hau Tree restaurant down by the beach. The view is gorgeous, especially at day break. But the food is mediocre and overpriced. I can't say about lunch and dinner since I was always out for those meals.Service. Not much to say there. Usual level of service expected form this respected chain. The soap and other amenities for the bathroom are from L'Occitane en Provence. Really nice stuff.All in all, I was very happy with this hotel and will come back next time I need to be in Honolulu.","san diego, CA","sd122</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>san diego, CA</strong>",86,5.0

One benefit of being down in busy Waikiki is the easier rental of an umbrella. The beach here itself though is nice and effective.There is no pool.Homeless people: we'd see the odd one here and there around the hotel area, but not near as many as in Waikiki.

A small refrigerator was included, which we appreciated. Overall, the hotel is in ok shape, but I think renovation time is approaching, or ought to be. The bell and parking staff were terrific (parking is $24/day for guests, with in and out privileges). The place where the Kaimana didn't excel was in the Hau Tree restaurant.

You are just a 10 min walk along the beach to the hustle and bustle of Waikiki without being in the downtown core. We were able to hit the strip, enjoy the amazing restaurants, do some shopping but then quietly stroll the beach back to our peaceful hotel. The beach feels virtually private and was never crowded. Many locals use this beach to avoid the tourists and that was just the experience we were looking for. At night we would sit on the beach and watch the moon and there was not a soul around. Our room was incredible. It was recently renovated and the furnishings and view were spectacular. I believe it was room 606. We had a corner suite with a wrap around lanai that had amazing views of Diamond Head, Waikiki and, of course, the ocean!

I got the feeling I was not treated with respect for several reasons, but my gender was one of them). The next room was slightly more expensive but it wasn't claustrophobic; other guests who upgraded to the top-level rooms liked them, apparently, but for that kind of money, I'd stay at the Halekulani or a cleaner, updated hotel.

When I called the front desk, I was told that there was nothing that could be done to move our room, but I could pay to upgrade to the room advertised on the website . . we declined. I feel this hotels advertising is totally deceiving and will not stay at this hotel again.See photos. . . .","Lahaina, Hawaii, United States","Pacific Builder...

Our rate included breakfast which never disappointed and was served in a lovely open air restaurant setting looking out to the ocean. The mai-tais and banana daiquiris in the lounge were perfect and the fried zucchini app was excellent. The staff at the reception desk were incredibly pleasant and went above and beyond to answer any question we had providing bus info maps etc. my only complaint would be the absence of a pool but that was a fact we were well aware prior to booking. As for restaurants within comfortable walking distance....lulu's great fish tacos ( casual good for sunset, reasonably priced, Tiki's great mai-tais, fish and chips also casual good for sunsets. Favorite was Uncle Bo's the seafood trap appetizer is a must, the baked opah with shrimp and the seabass dinners were not only great but included a starch and veggie for $22 Drinks were also very good and cheap ($8 avg)Must Do: the diamond crater hike sneakers or hiking shoes are a must and don't forget your camera.

Quite boutique hotel fronting the best section of beach in Wakiki. The beach isn't crowed even on the weekend, and there is a calm cove to swim. Oh and the views are to die for, especially at night. As a boutique, it lacks some of the facilities you find in larger hotels. There is no pool (not that you need one with the great beach just a step away), the bar closes early and the restaurant isn't open all the hours of the day (let alone late at night). However what they do have, it top notch. The restaurant food is excellent, the serve great drinks at the bar, and the rooms are wonderful. I was in one fo the upper rooms facing the ocean, and it was clearly renovated recently. Quality furnishings, nice bed, marble bathroom with new fixtures, and large flat screen TVs. They have a activities desk, furnish towels and mats for the beach, and rent snorkels/fins. I found the service staff very good if at times a bit slow.

I wrote a positive review of the hotel after our stay last February but mentioned that it needed some renovations. When I made reservations for our December visit I requested the same room (ocean front on the 8th floor with great ocean and Waikiki outlooks, wrap around lanai that even gives a peek at Diamond Head) because the views where so spectacular. When we checked into the room we found it had been completely remodeled, a lovely surprise! The bellman told us that they were in the process of remodeling all the rooms but not all have been completed. It would probably be a good idea to ask when making reservations. Another reviewer mentioned that this is a three star hotel in a five star location, which is a very good description. It is somewhat expensive but this is on the beach in Honolulu. Having lived in Hawaii for 8 years in the 1980s, one realizes that everything is more expensive. It is certainly less expensive than most of the waterfront hotels in the midst of Waikiki and much more serene. Besides having a wonderful beach/ snorkeling right in front of the hotel there are not a lot of options for children's entertainment, although the Waikiki Aquarium is in easy walking distance. This is a hotel not a resort, which frankly is a plus for us. There is no pool or hot tub nor adventure packages done by the hotel. There is a charge for car parking (as there is at every hotel in Waikiki). We found the hotel staff very pleasant and accommodating. They printed our boarding passes at the desk for us although another reviewer said that they did not. We bought the breakfast plan which worked out well for us. Since we have numerous friends in the area we only ate in the restaurant one night this trip but always find it more reasonable than any other beach front restaurant. The restaurant is small and can get very busy because it is popular with locals and Japanese tourists so reservations are recommended. We typically buy liquor at the store and have our cocktails in private on our balcony where the view is more spectacular than in the bar...cheaper too. We travel to Hawaii several times a year on business and could probably stay anywhere but this is our hotel of choice in Honolulu...beautiful views, low key, great location. If what you want is entertainment for the kids, hustle bustle Waikiki, lavish public rooms and obsequious service you might be happier somewhere else. If you want the best views for your money, a charming small restaurant, a quieter beach, and more serenity than you will find any where else in Waikiki, I recommend the New Otani!","Tucson, Arizona","rivertraveler1003</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tucson, Arizona</strong>",45,5.0

In my opinion, it is still a lovely three-star lodging in a five-star location. Those panoramic views from the balcony are not to be missed. The beach is still quiet and peaceful. The park is serene, and I never mind the shaded walk to Waikiki. But among the senior staff members on duty (not the young people,) one can detect an unmistakable streak of arrogance. Complimentary morning coffee service is sketchy, with no apparent allegiance to the advertised schedule. Restaurant managers are slightly irritable. The concierge seems weary of tourists and uniformed about events. (I finally found enthusiastic help in the lobby of the Outrigger in Waikiki.) I get the feeling that this property caters mainly to local residents and frequently returning business travelers, kind of like a private club that is somehow obliged to serve the general public. That's a shame because the young people who work here do a beautiful job of making you feel welcome.

This is considered a boutique hotel.Positives.Ocean view rooms have great views of waikiki and the water. Really one of a kind for the price. $224/ night. Overnight valet was $23. Valet drivers were quick and attentive and very nice to talk to. Hotel is right on the beach. Sana souci beach is a small private area great for swimming and snorkel and launching kayaks. The waves do not get rough here. No board sports here though. You have to make a short walk down the beach walk to find much surfing and body boarding. There is a well stocked convience store on the property as well as other shops. We bought cereal and pop tarts here for breakfast most days. Beach towels are free to check out. Staff was friendly throughout the hotel. Rooms very clean with great air conditioning. Room had a nice sized safe that will fit a laptop and various valuables.Negatives...Room was pretty small. We found our selves very crowded with all our luggage out. They have a dresser and closet space to hang clothes. But only staying four days, we did not utilize much of it. They have an activities desk where you can book tours and rent beach equipment and lessons. However the attendent was never around when we wanted to find info. Not sure if she is directly related to the hotel or not. It is about a 10-15min walk to waikiki, 2 paths street or a nice beach walk. At night this walk can be bit daunting do to the homeless folks who set up camp in the park or live out of their cars along the street. We did not have any problems but you were definetly on alert. Conclusion....This is a very japanese hotel. Reflective of room size and various policies and of course clientel. Great hotel for middle age and older couples. Away from the hustle of waikik but with in walking distance to all the action. Overall we enjoyed our stay, as we are in our thirties and like to be active but have a nice retreat at the end of the day. A note about oahu. Most activities close around 5pm.

Generally, in the universe of hotels, the New Otani is probably ""average"" or just below average. But when the price hovers around $400 per night (then add valet parking, the ""resort fee"" for which you get the use of beach towels and spotty internet and not much else that I could see, and the cost of having to eat out for most meals for the term of the stay to that per-night cost), the experience should be, at the very least, very good. This was not. We've stayed at the Grand Hyatt and at Kuhio Shores condos on Kauai, the Ritz on Maui, and Horizon House on the Big Island, and by comparison the New Otani has the terrible honor of having been the most expensive and the worst - by far - of the bunch.The view from the Queen suite was a show-stopper, that's true. But after staying there 9 (yes, that's nine) days, my perspective is that we were pretty much paying only for that view.The staff was - with a couple of exceptions - not very friendly, or very helpful. There was one valet (mentioned in other reviews on Yelp, I noticed today) who was very nice, helpful by offering tips for snorkel sites and directions, and who was also very interesting and talked with us about the hotel's (in my opinion short-sighted and antiquated) policy of not permitting staff to have tattoos showing even when the tattoos are expressions of native culture being worn by Hawaiian people. He was kind and welcoming to us, and actually remembered that we were guests there when we saw him day after day, unlike his co-workers.The other valets seemed annoyed by us. At other hotels we've stayed at, valets would help (or at least offer to help) with our snorkeling equipment and bags from our day trips; here, they uniformly did not ask whether we needed help, and would stand there as we struggled to get everything out of the car quickly so as not to hold up the valet line. A couple of the valets either couldn't remember or pretended that they didn't remember that we were actually guests (asking us if we were checking in when we'd been staying there almost a week and had encountered this particular person multiple times), and that we were together (asking my partner for her valet ticket number, and then asking me for mine, even though we were standing inches apart, had come down the stairs together, were engaged in conversation with each other, and were pretty obviously ""together"" - traveling together at least, even if these individuals didn't recognize us as a couple).Other staff members questioned my request for four beach towels for two of us (""Four of you in your room?!"" ""Um, no, but as you can see I'm a larger person, so it's helpful for me to have two towels..."" and do I really need to explain this to you when I'm standing right in front of you, there is a closet full of towels right there next to us, and I've only asked for 4 of them for 2 people for a day of swimming, which doesn't seem excessive?). Another gave us partial and incorrect information about the hotel restaurants. The beachfront restaurant, while always crowded for dinner, had limited hours and likewise limited and also somewhat strange food options (very little for the vegetarian; didn't even have any bread that they could serve with her paltry iceberg salad). The hotel has a very limited room service menu and room service hours. The hotel tower is also motel-like in that the doors to each room exited to the outside, and the hallways ringed an interior courtyard-type area. The venting from the hotel restaurants apparently goes up that interior courtyard, so each day when we left the room we were greeted with different but equally overpowering smells - morning fried bacon, afternoon tempura, evening steak smells. This wasn't a little waft. This was full-on, standing outside a restaurant kitchen vent stink, which was at times a bit nauseating.This next point I make carefully. We are from Seattle, we have traveled and are used to interacting with friends, clients, and other people in the world for whom English is not a first language, and we made the reservation perfectly aware that we were going to a Japanese-owned hotel. We expected many of the staff might speak English as a second (or third, fourth, so on) language, and that in this context we would be the ones with the accents. It was, however, surprisingly and exceedingly difficult to obtain information from some staff members including the gentleman who checked us out, because of a language barrier. He literally could not communicate with us about our questions about the bill, and there was no one else there with whom we could speak at the time. Given the bill we were being asked to sign was in the mid-four figures, and that the hotel is not advertised as being exclusively Japanese, we were surprised that there was not an English-speaking front desk person available when some number of the people checking in or out would, presumably, not be able to speak Japanese.Another front desk staff member was, frankly, rude and not helpful when we (gasp!) wanted information about the 3:30 AM fire alarms that went off one night (Hi, front desk? The fire alarm just went off, and we started to leave but noticed no one else left their rooms. Is there a fire somewhere? Fire alarm - is there a fire? Fire? No fire? If you're sure it wasn't a fire, do you know why the alarm went off? Was the alarm just in our room? Oh, you were testing them? In the middle of the night? Oh, not testing, but resetting them? What does that mean - are the alarms broken? Wait - I hear it on the other side of the hotel now - are you sure there's no fire? Ok, then, can you tell me when the weird residual static noise emanating from the alarm speaker in the ceiling of our room will stop, so we can get some sleep? No? Can you do anything to stop it? No? Ok, thanks, bye).The housekeeping staff did a good job, and the day we checked out we left a tip for them, accordingly.As other reviewers have noted about their rooms, our room (a suite in the ""new, renovated"" area) smelled strongly of mildew. Given housekeeping seemed to do a good cleaning each day, we could not determine the source of the smell. In the end we opined it was the a/c system, but who knows.The beach in back of the hotel was lovely. We watched the sunset there almost every evening, and the crowd gathered there was a nice mix of locals, others who live on the island, and tourists. I recommend reef shoes if you enter the beach in the middle to the left. The right is more sandy. We swam a bit there, but we snorkeled elsewhere.As others also state, the hotel is on the quiet end of Waikiki. Again, the view from our room was stunning, of the ocean and downtown. However - and this is of course no reflection on the hotel - the jellyfish were visiting our first few days, and because I was anxious to get in the water we actually went and double-stayed one night at the Hilton Hawaiian Village so we could have use of their saltwater lagoon and other pools. At the Hilton we stayed in a tower with its own pool, not far from the lagoons, and paid over $100 less than we did for the New Otani room. For those who haven't visited Waikiki before - the walking distance between the New Otani and the hotels at the top of the strip (Hilton Village, Royal Hawaiian) is around a mile, but in the heat and the humidity and depending on what you are carrying and your level of activity, the walk may or may not be something you are up for multiple times per day. We ended up driving back and forth to visit restaurants, etc. Information about buses and taxis were not readily available at the New Otani. The ""travel desk"" was most often empty.We tried to borrow or rent one of the paddle boards stored on the side of the hotel. The front desk person couldn't help us, and referred us to the ""travel desk,"" gesturing to the empty table across the lobby. We never ended up in the lobby when the mysterious travel desk person was there, so no paddle board for us. (At least not there; we rented one at the Hilton, $30 for an hour, but it was fun and worth it).The convenience store onsite was a sad, sad step-down from the 39 ABC Stores in Waikiki. We wistfully wished for an ABC Store onsite.(There is no swimming pool - the very good is for the beach onsite).In the end, the view was breathtaking, but the absence of helpful service and enjoyable food options on-site rendered this place an overpriced mistake. If you stay and, as some on Yelp have, can get some super deal where you are paying $150 or less per night, then you might be getting what you pay for. But the postcard view wasn't worth the $400+ per night; this hotel just doesn't offer what you expect when you are paying that much. We will choose more wisely next time, and we won't stay at the New Otani again.","Seattle, WA","JP1152001</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, WA</strong>",36,2.0

We must have changed our minds every other day. Finally, we agreed to look for a hotel away from the hustle and noise of downtown and stay closer to Diamond Head. After debating over a few locations we chose the New Otani and we could not have been happier that we did.Other than a rather surely man at the front desk who ""greeted"" our late night arrival, the hotel was everything we could have hoped for. The refurbished rooms with a view of Diamond Head and the Beach were elegantly designed and radiated serenity. The room had a wrap around lanai that was perfect for relaxing with a glass of wine and watching either the ocean or Diamond Head (which loomed over us).. Service was impeccable and the staff were very friendly (except for the night person). Breakfast in the beachfront dining room was a delight. Dinner there was a bit pricey but worth every penny. We also had a very relaxing and delicious dinner at the Japanese restaurant on the second floor. The park across the street is a wonderful place to rest and enjoy watching local activities. Under the shadow of Diamond Head, I sat and watched, among other things, people in yoga classes, high-school students in soccer practice, Frisbee tossing and a volleyball game. t was also nice to sit just outside the hotel and watch the residents go by wheeling their children or, more frequently, doing their daily run.For us, the location was perfect. It was very hot when we were in Honolulu and it is about a 20 minute walk to downtown. We did the walk once and decided we would rather stay around the hotel. I had a bit of a chuckle regarding a remark in a review that one has to walk a bit to find a cup of coffee. We just used the coffee maker and coffee provided in the room.The general area is quiet and we never had any trouble getting a good night's sleep. There is a very well stocked convenience store at the hotel which carried everything from goggles to beer and wineIn sum, this is the hotel I would stay at in Honolulu and would unreservedly recommend to others. .","Toronto, Canada","azikell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",6,5.0

This was the second leg of our vacation, and the third hotel we stayed at in Hawaii. The hotel is in a great location, right on the beach and next to the Kapiolani Park on the south side of Waikiki. The hotel is also located within walking distance of the Honolulu Aquarium, the Honolulu Zoo, the Waikiki strip, and Diamond Head Crater. The location was ideal for getting around the Honolulu/Waikiki area, as we were on mopeds most of the time. The park next door did house some vagrants and vagabonds, but we never felt unsafe. The location gets 5 stars from me, but that is the best part of the hotel.Our room was in the diamond head wing, which claims to have been recently upgraded/redone, but it didn't feel like it. The room size was average, and had good amenities like a microwave, fridge, and sink. The bathroom was ok. A large vanity area separate from the toilet and shower. The shower was meek at best though. Very little water pressure, and whenever another guest in your wing flushed, the water temperature changed dramatically. The room was mostly clean, but we did have a lot of tiny ants by the front door and in the kitchen area. Big turn-off. Overall I would give the room about two out of five stars.The staff was very friendly and accommadating, and we got beach towels and mats every day. They also were very knowledgable about the area, and informed us of a few great hot spots to visit. There is barley any parking (read: no parking) at the hotel unless you want to valet for 23$ per night. There is a park next door and across the streer that you can park your vehicles at, but it is very crowded during the day, and even spots fill up quick at night. There are also a few shops/businesses located on hotel grounds, but they were pricy. The on-site restaurant also looked very nice, but was very pricy (around 80$ a person for a decent dinner).Overall, this was the better of the two hotels we stayed at while in Oahu, but I probably will stay somewhere else next time.","Reno, Nevada","Dutney B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Reno, Nevada</strong>",15,3.0

Of particular importance, was the awesome view from our corner room and San Souci beach just outside the hotel. By far, these were the two aspects worth paying for. The 15 minute walk from the hotel to Waikiki and back, just to get coffee, food, etc, can be a pain though. However, I must say the thing I found most annoying about the hotel was the poor customer service. Having just stayed 4 days earlier at the Modern Hotel at the opposite end of Waikiki, the lack of customer service at the New Otani Kaimana becomes apparent. Franky, the customer service at Teddy's Bigger Burgers was way better.For instance, I did not have my phone with me, so I asked the front desk if they could tell me what the weather was like in Waimea Bay - I was told they did not know. They did not even bother to Google it.Today, I asked if the lounge had a Happy Hour and was told yes, from 2-4 pm. Then, when we showed up at that time and inquired about the Happy Hour, the bartender just shook his head and said not for about 5 years. I stated that a lady at the hotel had told me there was one and he flippantly said ""who, the cashier"". He was completely dismissive and that is not a way to treat guests.On other item that seems to be guest unfriendly, is the fact that while there is free internet from your room, in order to print your boarding passes, you must use the front lobby computer for a fee of $5 minimum, plus .75 per page to print. What the hell? Isn't the point to be guest friendly and make our stay easier?FYI, I called the Modern Hotel where I had just stayed a few days prior, to thank again the manager for her help while there. In doing so, I complained about this incident and she told me I could come by and print my boarding passes there, if I needed to. Now that is customer service!To be clear, the New Otani Kaimana hotel has a great view of Waikiki, if you get the right room. The beach right outside the hotel is also great, and has an overall calmer environment. However, there are better hotels for less, and they will make your vacation stay with them feel like it matters.","San Jose, California","travelpolice_97</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",2,4.0

The rooms are a bit small and Wi-Fi is very slow, but if you're in Oahu to browse the web in your hotel room you probably aren't reading this to begin with. Besides, at least the Internet is likely to be upgraded at some point.The location is excellent, about a half mile south from the end of the main Waikiki strip (92), ideal for getting a quick warmup on your (my) 4:00 AM walk to downtown. The local beach is perfect for a lively atmosphere away from the downtown area. I have already recommended this place to relatives and acquaintances who are planning a trip to this island.

It's a boutique hotel right on the ocean and is perfect if you're looking for a peaceful vacation on Waikiki but away from the chaos of Waikiki. Things I liked the most: (1) It has valet parking (which you pay for, sadly) so getting in and out with a rental car is really easy. All of Waikiki is congested, but at the New Otani you just drive in and drop off your car in about 30 seconds and you're right there at the hotel entrance. This was very nice after long day trips to Diamondhead or Pearl Harbor. (2) They have a truly wonderful restaurant called the Hau Tree Lanai which is in the top 1% of restaurants I have ever visited in terms of atmosphere and view. You're under this enormous tree in the shade right on the beach. They're very busy, but my trick is to make reservations for 7:00am (right when they open) on OpenTable.com. I am a single traveler and many restaurants have an attitude problem with single diners (""oh hello, loser, no spouse or friends to bring today?"") but the people at the Hau Tree were splendid and welcomed me like I was an old friend, and in fact as a single diner I got the best tables in the place. Get the poi pancakes. (3) The rooms with views are expensive, but you get a view of all of Waikiki that is spectacular. (4) Service is great, and there is a little store on the street that has all the food and beach supplies you will need. Things I didn't care for: (1) Bathrooms were small. After you go swimming, you want to shower to get the sand and salt off, and it would be nice to have a big bathroom to move around. (2) It's a fair hike to the main part of Waikiki. You don't want to drive because parking in Waikiki is a pain, but if you walk you're looking at a good 15 minutes or more each way. That's okay once or twice a day, but late at night after a big dinner you may not feel like walking so far. (3) The beach at the New Otani is very quiet. It's near some big condos and this horrible thing called a ""natatorium"" which is a crumbling cement-walled swimming area on the beach. So the beach area outside the hotel feels confined, and on weekends it can get crowded, although I never felt it was too crowded. But the water is relatively calm, and if you want the bigger waves you need to go to the main part of Waikiki.Overall the things I liked vastly outweighed the things I didn't care for. I visit Hawaii now and then and plan to stay always at the New Otani Kaimana.",Nevada,"dleifker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nevada</strong>",168,5.0

We had booked this using miles on United, and we got the cheapest room selection. I had emailed the hotel earlier about upgrading, but thinking we would spend little time inside the room, I decided to not opt for an upgrade.When we checked in, we were pleasantly surprised to get a room on the 8th floor, Diamond Head side, with a narrow view of the Sans Souci beach. The hotel staff were very nice - Chris the bellhop was very helpful with tips. We immediately made reservations for dinner at the Hau Tree Lanai restaurant, and got exactly our desired seating at 6:15pm for the 6:40pm sunset dining. We also ate breakfast the next morning at 7am there, and had drinks one afternoon at the bar overlooking the Hau Tree Lanai. While the dinner was somewhat pricey and strictly from the food perspective not a great value, the ambiance and the service made up for that, and overall it is a great romantic location.The towels and beach mats, and one day even a beach chair, were very helpful. The beach is gorgeous. The location within walking distance of Waikiki beach was amazing! We never had parking issues - usually the valet would ask whether we planned on going out soon again, and park accordingly.The room was small, and the bathroom was also small. But we felt they were adequate. The two things that I wish they would change:1. There should be more electrical outlets in the room - specially near the desk. We had to ask for an extension cord to run from the outlet near the headboard - and once they provided it, it worked fine. But many of the outlets were covered with solid face plates. That does not make sense!2. One day we wanted coffee in the afternoon and went down to the bar. The barman said they would provide coffee maker in the room if we asked for it. Then we also read in the rules that they indeed do so. We got a coffee maker and coffee and cream and sugars, and every day the cleaning person would replenish the supplies. Why is this not standard? For this class of hotel, why do you have to make your guests ask for it?The wind howling across our 8th floor lanai was sometimes too loud, but we got used to it.Overall a very nice find, and we would definitely stay there again!Mahalo.","Altadena, California","SiddharthD252</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Altadena, California</strong>",22,4.0

And it still has a caring, local staff, many of whom have been there as long as we've been staying there. The bell staff are particularly accommodating with beach Mats, towels and chairs.The Hau Tree Lanai remains a romantic, if somewhat pricey, beachside dining spot and the Sunset Lanai is a quiet place for cocktails and, yes, sunsets.Some things have changed. For the better: The newly renovated Waikiki-view rooms are a welcome improvement, with much-improved bathrooms. There's free wi-fi, something other hotels should adopt. For the worse: there seem to be more tour groups coming to the Hau Tree Lanai, clogging the lobby and making it harder for guests to find space at the restaurant, especially at breakfast.But I'm willing to put up with the occasional tour group.

For the $300+/night I spent to accommodate a family of 4, we had an 80's style room overlooking the sidewalk and the parking lot that could definitely have been cleaner. Another party traveling with us was originally assigned to a tiny room with 2 twin beds through which the wind whistled so loudly that they requested to be moved. The staff were very pleasant and upgraded them to a better room. The lobby is looking a little worn out. The food at the Japanese restaurant within is good, although the atmosphere is a bit dated. The Hau Tree serves a very good breakfast, but make a reservation early, because it appears to be a popular stopping spot for Japanese tour buses, and they can get quickly overwhelmed in the morning. The beach is pleasant and quiet. However, if I had to do it over again, I think I'd pay a little more and get a modern, clean, updated room at the Marriott or something comparable. Or, I'd just take my money and spend it on another island, where the beach experience is far better to begin with.","Denver, Colorado","denverista</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",53,3.0

We ended up at the Otani because they had immediate availability. I will give them credit for that. Here we are, last minute and they fully accomodated us witha room...sort of. Their idea of a room is what us Westerners would call a closet. It was extremely small. My wife and I were tripping over each other trying to unpack our suitcases. Suitcases, which, when unpacked, were stored outside on the balcony. This room barely fit the queen sized bed. The bathroom waa also ill conceived. Small in space, the sink had no storage space and a shower that was nearly impossible to figure out how to work. The balcony overlooked a somewhat quiet beach when compared to the beach down by the Hilton. My only gripe were the number of homeless drunks laying right beneath ourbalcony. This is hardly the hotel's fault however. In a nutshell if you must, for some odd reason, feel the need to go to Waikkiki Beach for the actual beach, and you are traveling alone, the Otani will suffice. Don't expect any towels, pools or any real amenities and do expect a hefty bill for basically a closet sized room. We didn't last one night and opted to check out. The front desk was kind enough to not charge us for a full night, so customer service gets a bump there.

Why? Because it is the best situated hotel in Waikiki in my opinion. It is not a high rise but a comfortable 8 story boutique hotel with a wonderful familial feel to it. No sterile lobbies in which one gets lost. And dining at the Hau Tree Lanai (underneath a more than Century old Hau tree)practically right on the beach is worth the experience alone.  The location is fabulous: it stands as the first building on the far end of Kalakaua Avenue just beyond the Waikiki Aquarium. Therefore, if you get a room on the west side of the hotel (the locals will say the Ewa side) on the upper floors, you will have fantastic and unimpeded views of the ocean, Waikiki, Honolulu, the Waianae Mountains, Kapiolani Park (where the Honolulu Zoo is) and the valleys of the Koolaus in front of which Honolulu is situated. If you are on the other side of the hotel you will have great views of famous Diamond Head. But, even more important is the kindness, attentiveness and the competence of the staff, from the car parkers, to the reception folks, housekeeping, the wait staff, and management.

I went for the cheapest room option (Moderate) and was given a small room with a view of the parking lot - nothing glamorous and a bit noisy despite being on the fifth floor, as well as dated as other reviewers have mentioned. Amenities are very basic but there's a convenience store around the corner.The hotel location is fantastic if you're there on a holiday trip, though - right at the beach (Sans Souci, nice and quieter than other Waikiki equivalents) and within easy walking distance of attractions including the Aquarium, the Honolulu Zoo and Diamond Head crater, and about 15 minutes from Waikiki proper. I recommend the hike to the crater if you're feeling energetic - it took me three hours in total to walk from the hotel to the summit and back at a decent pace but stopping to take pictures.Service was unexceptional but the two restaurants at the hotel (Hau Tree Lanai and Miyako) were great - do book a table for breakfast if you want beachside seats at Hau Tree Lanai as it can get really busy. The early bird special at Miyako is great value and thoroughly recommended ($28 for a full three-course meal with fabulous views too - book for a window table or terrace cabana).Overall, it was a decent experience for what I paid and I would stay there again, probably paying a bit more for a seaview room.","London, United Kingdom","nmezza</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",10,4.0

I've logged over 100 hotel nights in Honolulu at most of the major hotels. This was a business trip that was booked only 2 weeks in advance during the summer, so reservation pickings were a bit slim. It was here or the Ohana East. I chose here. San Souci beach is one of the best beaches on the south shore, and I have always enjoyed sunset dinners at the Hau Tree Lanai, so I thought it was time to check the hotel out. The lobby is dated, but I had read online that they just completed renovating most of the rooms. I booked a Diamond Head view room. Maybe if they would have given me the room I booked, this would have been a different review.Instead, I was ""upgraded"" to a 1 bedroom in the Diamond Head wing. There are 2 wings to the hotel. The main hotel is a 10ish story high-rise, the Diamond Head wing is a 3 story walk-up. I was told the hotel was completely booked and I had what I reserved a park""ing lot"" view. It's not an upgrade just because it's bigger. If you ask for a house in Beverly Hills I don't think the real estate agent would consider a bigger house in Receda an upgrade (thanks Karate Kid for the LA geography lesson). The desk clerk said they would call tomorrow and let me know if they could move me to the main hotel the 2nd night. Never got a call back.The check-in clerk asked the bell clerk to show me to my room. He stepped out onto the front and pointed to the 3rd floor. No ask if I needed help lugging the luggage up the 3 flights of narrow stairs, nothing. The room was big, that's for certain. It's also very dated. If I would have paid about $100 a night less, I would have expected this level of decor, but for the same price as the beachfront hotel, I got a big, old, space overlooking the parking lot. The room is officially a 1 bedroom suite. It had a sitting area with 2 twin daybeds which were uncomfortable to sit on and felt like they would be equally uncomfortable to sleep on. There is also a large table over in the corner taking up space.The kitchenette was actually just a wetbar, refrigerator, and microwave. The bathroom is 2 rooms that cover the entire width of the suite. Everything in the room is dated. Carpet was clean though. It is a large space with no functional purpose. The televisions and TV system was terrible. Channel changing would lag and the picture was not formatted for the screen. The televisions were too small for such a large space. The bed was fairly comfortable, but the headboard was loose, so every time I moved, it shook up against the wall. Hot and cold water were hard to manage in the shower. It is a 2 knob system that requires some precise tuning to get the temperature manageable. Overall, a pretty disappointing visit. I am glad it just lasted only 2 nights. On checkout, the clerk didn't ask how my stay was or really acknowledge anything other than the fact I was leaving. I really wish this would have turned out better. I was looking forward to finding something away from the crowds of Waikiki.","Dallas, Texas","tulanecpt1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",29,2.0

Downside? We arrived in the hotel around 11pm after travelling for 27 hours, tired and very hungry. There was no room service after 9pm, the restaurants were closed as was the convenience store attached to the hotel, there were no coffee making facilities in the room and the vending machines sold only chocolate and soft drinks.

My room was on the 8th floor and faced the ocean, which was lovely. Although the room was small, it had been recently upgraded and included a small refrigerator, a safe and a nicely appointed bathroom. My favorite part was the little lanai where I could sit and watch the beach-goers plus stare out to sea. The ocean is really beautiful in front of the hotel and the beach, Sans Souchi, is a nice mix of locals and tourists. Even though I was there on the weekend, it never felt crowded. I walked to the Starbucks every morning, which was great as the short walk takes you through a park, behind the zoo and along the water. The hotel restaurants are quite good and, I thought, reasonably priced. The service was good, the staff friendly and overall this would be my new choice when I have to travel to Honolulu. The clean room and comfortable bed made up for the fact that it was a little cramped. It's unpretentious and I would recommend it for a business traveler as the rooms offer free wi-fi.

Due to the expense of this trip in total and the exclusivity of the purpose (our 10th anniversary), I booked this trip a year in advance and only after pouring over and over several reviews of just about any Waikiki hotel that had any appeal to start with. First lesson learned.....never overdo reviews. I found good and bad reviews on every hotel, even the most expensive. In the end, it's all someone's opinion and quite frankly, there are alot of misguided soles out there who give poor reviews because of their own lack of foresight into their own bookings. All that said, my wife and I loved this hotel, and we are both hotel managers back on the mainland. Here are the minor things we found and I stress minor as nothing had a negative impact on our stay. We noticed some very small ants had taken up a home behind the PTAC (air conditioner) and every once in awhile, some would pop out underneath, again they were almost microscopic. The door to the bathroom is a louver door and would be better if it were solidly concealing. That is it! What was great?... the room! We had an Oceanview deluxe which gave us a view split between directly toward downtown and the shoreline and ocean - fabulous! I am glad I didn't pay more for a ""full frontal"" of ocean, absolutely no need for it. The balcony lanais are small but perfect for their purpose of just sitting down and taking in the breezes of which there are many. The bed was ultra comfortable, the room spacious and very clean. Our package which was through Hotwire included and excellent breakfast each day in an awesome outdoor restaurant under the Hua tree. We ate no other meals there other than breakfast. The beach is much better than any of the heavily crowded Waikiki beaches and the hotel even gives complimentary use of beach towels. The lobby area is open to the exterior in the back making it quite breezy but very pleasant. Internet is free (try finding that in other Waikiki hotels) and valet parking which is required is within line if not a tad bit less than most other hotels. The seclusion of this hotel away from the rest of Waikiki is a super plus!!!! Easy walk to town and no sirens, buses, party crowds, garbage trucks etc.!!!! That was a key factor in choosing this hotel. The service including everyone from the room attendants to the valet attendants could not have been friendlier and accommodating although as hotel managers, we really weren't to needy in asking and even the tourist events coordinator which subcontracts space in the hotel but is not operated by the them, was very helpful in our planning of activities including sending us to a fabulous Luau on our last night there (Germaine's). This hotel provided a fabulous experience and I would love to stay again if I every visit Oahu in the future (I think Maui is next though). My compliments and gratitude to all the staff there. And lastly, you can find cheaper places sure, but be wary...Hawaii is a big ticket item - I don't advise scrimping on the hotel room even if you like many others don't plan on spending much time in the room. The bang for the buck at this hotel was awesome.","East Windsor, New Jersey","cataclysmic91</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>East Windsor, New Jersey</strong>",17,5.0

I am sure that this is a temporary problem but if you plan a visit soon, it would be a good idea to check on the status of the renovations.This is one of the finer places to stay in the Hawaiian Islands and has received many awards for service and location.Highly recommended!

The hotel was selected for participants specifically because of its location to a great beach. The beach was easy to access, not too crowded and perfect for swimming!Reviewers who said the decor is outdated are correct. The facility is in need of upgrade, which appears to be in progress. I was upgraded to a room with a beautiful view of Diamond Head (no view of water), that was delightful to look at. The nice patio was a plus.The room itself is in need of refurbishment. The bed appeared to be two twin beds pushed together, and there was no work desk in the room. The tub had a hard time draining. However, the room was clean and spacious. Though I would not choose it for a romantic getaway, it was fine for a solo business traveller.The restaurant downstairs under the banyon tree was beautiful, and a great place to start the day. However, if you weren't dining at the restaurant, coffee was hard to come by. The hotel does set out the airpots and small styrophome cups from 6:30am-7:00am, but beyond that time you'll need to leave the hotel.

Below are pros and cons:Pros:(1) Since it's a bit away from the center of Waikiki (see Cons No. 1), although the hotel is located on the beach, it's significantly cheaper than other hotels located close to the center of Waikiki beach.(2) It's literally on the beach. Since the hotel is smallish, you really feel that the hotel is on the beach (I think you don't feel that way in a big hotel on the beach because the main building of the hotel is not as close to the beach as this one)(3) Therefore, it's quiet. The beach in front of the hotel has a feel of a private beach (of course, there is no private beach in Honolulu)(4) If you drive out of Honolulu, it's convenient, because you can avoid crazy traffic of the central part of Waikiki.(5) Has a bit of a ""boutique"" feel (although it's hard for me to call it boutique). Sort of similar to smallish hotels in the Mediterranean. Cozy and personal.(6) Staff are all nice and friendly.(7) You can get beach towel and beach mattress for free and go to the beach.(8) It's next to a park, and a lot of local Hawaiian are having fun (BBQ, sports...) in the park. So you can feel less touristic.(9) Room is clean albeit not new, and spacious (for Honolulu standard). Equipped with a decent-sized balcony.(10) There is a morning coffee service at the front desk (but they close it very early...)(11) Close to the Diamond Head. You can actually walk or run there.Cons(1) FAR AWAY from the center of Waikiki!!!! You need to talk 10 minutes (possibly 15 if you don't walk fast) to get to the nearest bar (except for the one at the hotel) or ABC store (there is a small convenience store at the hotel but there's no comparison to ABC). To the center of Waikiki (let's say Moana Surf Rider), you need to walk 25-30 minutes. And the public transportation is limited (there seems to be a bus but it seems that the bus runs not very frequently). And ladies might not want to walk at night to the hotel (there's a big park, and it's sort of quiet/dark).(2) I was cheap and chose the cheapest room, which is located in the Annex. Annex has only three floors and not facing directly to the sea. People in the park nearby can see the inside of the room. Annex is significantly worse than the main building I think.All in all, I think it's a great deal, if you don't mind the distance.

Some rooms in the hotel are currently being refurbished but we knew about it beforehand. The location of the hotel is fantastic, walking distance to Waikiki (10-15min) in a very peaceful and quiet area next to Kapiolani park. I haven't rated the hotel with 5 stars due to the small room size, lack of kettle/coffee machine in the room, very small bath towels and the refurbishment works which theoretically start daily at 9am but in practice you can start hearing the noise from 7:30am. Everything else exceeded our expectations (cleanliness, comfy bed, new decor, L'occitane toiletries...). The staff is very friendly. Upon our arrival we were given a room on the third floor. We booked an Ocean Superior room but could only see palm trees out of the window so asked at reception whether they could give us another room and we were relocated to the 8th floor which had the Ocean view we were dreaming about. The hotel has a helpdesk with a very friendly person who provides you with as much information as you need about places to visit, activities to do during your stay, etc. The hotel has a parking area ($23/day) but if you don't want to pay the daily rate you could safely park your car on the street (there's plenty of free parking on the opposite side of Kapiolani park). If you rent a car through the hotel's website beware that the prize doesn't include the compulsory car insurance ($35-$80 per day!!). There's a small convenience store next to the hotel (for which there's a one off 10% discount for the hotel guests) and direct access to the beach. The New Otani Kaimana is very good value for your money. Recommended!",UK,"Young_lass_UK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>UK</strong>",19,4.0

The first two days there was no hot water in the hotel, some boiler problem and we felt the management did not properly respond to our concerns so we moved to the New Otani which was approximately half the cost. We were delighted we changed. The Halekulani is definitely fancier and more elegant but in many ways the New Otani was much more to our taste. Being enclosed in buildings and people in Waikiki is not our style so we appreciated the distance. One could still walk there or take the bus if needed. To us an important part of the Hawaii experience is the beach and the New Otani sits right on an excellent beach with good swimming. The hotel has beach towels, mats, chairs, and flippers available. We booked an ocean view deluxe room which hung out over the beach. The floor to ceiling windows and sliding glass doors provided a wrap-around view of the ocean and Waikiki. From the lanai we could also see Diamond Head. We loved it so much we chose to have breakfast and cocktails on our lanai rather than in the restaurant which can get crowded and what could be more romantic than that stunning view. The food was very good; many local people come to the charming outdoor restaurant for breakfast, lunch, and dinner occasions.

In fact it is on the beach so it's easy to go for your early morning or evening swim. Breakfast is served in a lovely open air terrace filled with shady trees. The problem is that there aren't enough seats to accommodate all guests and opens only at 7 am so you either book in advance or you will queue for a loooong time.

The beach area is beautiful with a variety of activities. I simply cannot say enough about the location and price. For such an expensive destination, the price for staying at this hotel was more than ideal. We did park our rental car in the park at night, basically, right outside of our sliding glass door, and didn't have to pay for parking. Do be careful where you park in Honolulu though... We were towed our very first night there (out of a parking garage) because we had no idea we were parking on private property. That was our mistake....

And on the small side. But I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Honolulu.That's because:1) The location can't be beat. It's on the coolest beach on that side of the island. Great swimming (in fact, there's kind of a little swimming course out to a wind-sock and back that's fun, challenging, and a favorite of locals as well,) good snorkeling. You can learn to surf nearby. It's a 15-minute walk from Waikiki so you have the option of immersing yourself in the riff-raff or keeping away if you want to.2) The staff can't be beat. I think it's telling that in the 10 years or so I've been coming to this hotel the staff turnover has been almost zero. The super friendly super helpful faces you see time and time again range from the parking valet, to the front desk staff, to the people who book touristy stuff...3) The value is good...c'mon...where else are you going to get a decent beachfront hotel for $135 a night or ocean view for $240? Also, the in-room amenities are excellent. And the public areas of the hotel are pristine.So, in this case, I'm willing to overlook a slightly musty room, or a badly stained carpet in favor of what always ends up being a very positive experience.","New York, NY","mikebern</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NY</strong>",129,5.0

Our room was a Deluxe Ocean View on the 4th floor for $240/night + $23/day parking before a 13% tax. While not much wider than the king bed, it had reasonable floor space between the foot of the bed & small table & chairs. The dresser & refrigerator were tucked into the wall along the walkways.

The sheets & cover were of excellent quality too.The view was a good one for a room that was not the top location & pricing. The balcony was just deep enough for us to sit at an angle. Our complaints center around the number of inconveniences we encountered & a consistent, uniform attitude of indifference from various staff. 1. Restaurant service was mediocre & the loud music from the bar's crooner made communications with wait-staff & each other a bit of a challenge. 2. None of their restaurants were open when we wanted an early lunch at 11am - despite late breakfasters who lingered there - or an early dinner a different day. Even the bar wouldn't serve food at those times.3. Reservations were needed for the primary dining room for ALL meals due to its small size. 4. Something was happening at the park the hotel borders every day. This meant speakers blaring from 7:30am until 10pm. On vacation we like to sleep in or wake up slow.5. We had to call housekeeping to the room two nights due to a malfunctioning stopper in the tub. 6. Since its a small hotel with a tiny lobby, there's no place to hang out & enjoy the view if you don't want to be on the beach itself or in your room.I'd chosen this location to get away from the noisiness of the Waikiki hotels per TripAdvisor reviewers.

This hotel is right on Sans Souci Beach, only steps from the hotel. which makes for some pretty good sight seeing from the restaurant, the bar or our balcony. There is a life guard station right there and yet the beach is not crowded at all - like it is just up the way on Kuhio or Waikiki beaches.

Also there are some small shops in the building but if you want to be within walking didstance of Waikiki Shopping this isn't it. Valet parking is the only option and at $25/night seemed like a lot, but we always got our car IMMEDIATELY - no long wait, and felt that it was in a very safe lot.

Valet parking at the hotel is $23 a day.The Diamond Head side rooms are tiny--just room enough to walk around the twin beds and really no provision for suitcases (mine, empty, would not fit under the bed). With two people in the room, it's a bit crowded. The place is clean and the staff friendly. There is a cool-ish refrigerator for drinks and leis and a safe.

This is the first hotel on the south side of Kapiolani park, ON the beach.Perfect hotel for travlers who want to wake up peacefully after a quiet nights sleep, get in rental car and drive around Oahu, come back to hotel, hit the beach for evening swim then go to bed.If you have been to Waikiki then you know how crowded it is (nothing like Magnum PI). On my second trip there I decided to get a quieter hotel. If you need the noise, bars, dance clubs, thousands of people just outside your window this is NOT the place for you. This hotel has 2 sections, Main building has smaller rooms but they are closer to the beach, better for couples. The annex of this hotel is couple of hundred feet from the beach these are like mini apartments with kitchens, this is probably better for families.some Hints:In the early morning and early evening you can find FREE parking along Kapiolani park (pay attention to the signs). If not then pay for the $23 hotel parking.If you get a rental car, buy a cheap cooler at some store, fill it with drinks, booze and snacks, you can take in to hotel room and use as mini fridge. You can rent snorkeling gear at the hotel for better prices than anywhere else.Some WARNINGS:Hotel does not offer breakfast, the on site restaraunt is for dinner only. (to be fair very few Waikiki hotels offer breakfast) So you will be walking to Dukes or get into car and drive to some breakfast joint away from the beach.Bring your walking shoes, if you want to walk to the restaraunts, stores on the other side of the park it is about 0.5mi walk each way. Also the park has beach bums living on it, they usually sell Leis made with real flowers about 5 bucks each, on corner of Kapahulu and Kalakaua.","Carrollton, Texas","ciscokid1970</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carrollton, Texas</strong>",137,5.0

We had about 8 bags, most of them heavy... of course we needed help!! Check in was smooth enough but then we got to the room. Oh my... the most depressing place I've seen since back in the days when I had to stay in cheap business hotels in Tokyo. The ""moderate"" room is to be avoided at all costs. They are tiny little coffins fitted out with functional but ugly furniture with no colour at all. Bland, tasteless, musty, old, pukey. The aircon smelled so we had to turn it off. Bathroom plastic and tiny. Our room was the second from the beach so although no direct sea view, we could see the big blue from the balcony - which by the way was about 30cm wide and for the most part looked out onto a parking lot. For us, the killer was that the internet was dodgy (worked sometimes, other times not), was not wifi and it is impossible to connect more than one computer at a time. That was a deal breaker for us, as we run a business and have to keep up with emails etc at night (plus research the rest of our trip). To their credit, they let us cancel the rest of our stay without any charge even though we had already paid for the entire stay.We did have breakfast at the Hau Tree Lanai and it was pleasant, although the food (like all food in Hawaii it seems) was not all that healthy and left us feeling heavy and tired. There was no services attached to the hotel either - no laundry, internal spa, fitness center, amenities - very basic indeed and totally overpriced. We didn't even like the beach that much, as there were no waves to catch, so it was kind of more like a swimming pool. Certainly not what you come to Hawaii for. Well, not us, anyway.We're in another hotel now which was half the price and is 100 times better.

The room was clean, the air conditioner worked great and we had a nice view of Diamond Head. I liked how the hotel was just outside the hustle of Waikiki, but yet close enough to walk. It was also very easy to find, which was a relief considering the network of one-way streets in the area.

So I knew that the location is great and that it has access to a wonderful, and (for Waikiki) fairly quiet beach. Usually I stay at the Royal Hawaiian, but this time I decided to try something quieter and cheaper.The stay began well -- they upgraded me to an ocean view suite despite it being the Fourth of July weekend. The Otani Suite is a corner room on a high floor. From one balcony, you get a view of the ocean and from the other a very close-up view of Diamond Head. You can't get much better than that in Waikiki.In my opinion, the quieter location and the fact that you can get such a great view for a reasonable price compensates for the hotel's flaws. The biggest downside is that parts of the hotel haven't been renovated in a while. My suite seemed semi-renovated. Clearly, some parts of it had recently been refreshed, but the bathroom retained its 1980s-style fixtures (gold-plated faucets!) and a jacuzzi tub that's seen better days. I liked the fact that the hotel is very open, so you exit the rooms into an outdoor hallway. But from that angle, it looks little better than a motel. Still, the hotel grew on me. Even though it was touristy, there was something laid-back about it that I liked. And of course the Hau Tree restaurant is worth at least a couple of visits!","Boston, Massachusetts","SkyeTraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",559,4.0

I again stayed in this hotel in room 612 in July of 2011. And, my opinion is basically the same. There are good and bad points to this hotel.We had requested room 812 where we stayed last trip. However, the hotel did not accomodate that request, and moved us two floors lower. Basically the same exact room, so not sure why our request could not be granted...but, oh well...same great view.With investment, this could be a premiere property. The beautiful San Souci beach is one of the best in Waikiki. Being away from the hustle and bustle of the main strip is a plus, but being just a short walk from that action, is also a plus. The rooms are clean. There are some minor updates done to the rooms, but they are still very dated. Our bathroom this time had pink and green wall paper, a gold-colored flush knob on the toilet, yet other fixtures were chrome. So, the place needs some TLC and cohesiveness. The shower did not have much pressure, yet the tub still drained slowly. But, still we had an amazing view of the ocean, so who spends their time staring at the dated wallpaper anyway?Last time I commented about how quiet my room was. This time, not so much. When our neighbors had their t.v. on, it sounded like it was coming from our room! Luckily, they turned it off by 10, and we did not hear any other sounds.The guy that checked us in was friendly, helpful and had a smile on his face. Our maid the same. However, all other staff we came in contact with, barely made eye contact, or could produce a smile. No one was rude, yet very few were overly pleasant.Again, we faced homeless people in the park. This time, two begged for money. But, we never felt threatened.On, July 4th, they ran out of beach towels... minor inconvenience. Ate at the hotel's Miyako restaurant...again, fantastic food and service. Yet, the place still looks like a cheap Chinese Restaurant off of the interstate, (albeit, with a beautiful view of the ocean),The thing that got me the most this time, was when I started comparing prices. We had Mai-Tai's at the hotel's bar. $11.00 per drink! That's right, $11.00!!! Yet, when we had Mai-Tai's at Dukes Canoe Club, they were $7.50. At Hula's $5.00!We bought a 750ML bottle of Sky Vodka at an ABC store...it was $17.95. However, at the hotel's convenience store, this same 750ML bottle was $22.95! One banana, they sold for .79cents. One banana!So, it seems the hotel is taking advantage of the fact that you are so far from other facilities, so they gouge you on their prices...because they know it is a 10 minute walk for you to buy elsewhere. While this may be the capitalist way, because there is no near competition, it seems wrong to gouge your customers choosing to stay in your hotel. I met a local, who referred to the hotel's convenience store as ""shopping at Tiffany's"" because their prices are so inflated!Anyway, after 5 trips to Honolulu and looking for a hotel with an ocean view room.... this is still the best hotel I can find at this price range. Unless research or suggestions come up with other viable alternatives, I will return again to this hotel upon my next trip. Tip for next trip: Avoid the convenience store, and make a trip to Safeway to stock up on toiletries, snacks and drinks. Do not patronize the hotel bar, as their prices are inflated. Forget about the appearance of the room and homeless people, and focus on the beauty of the ocean! So, the front desk does not make eye contact, or smile...as long as they are not rude...who cares...you are in Hawaii afterall!",Dallas,"jvmaddux</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas</strong>",164,4.0

It's just a short walk to the strip in Waikiki but far enough away that you don't feel like you're in the city. The hotel is an older building that's been renovated so the rooms are a little small but they're clean and comfortable with great built in storage and spacious lanais. It's not a luxury property but it's got a boutique atmosphere with nice amenities and who needs a pool with the beach just out your door? The restaurant and lounge serve great food and drinks, we were able to sit in the lounge and order from the full restaurant menu. Kaimana (Sans souci) beach is right out front and it's a lovely beach; small and off the beaten path, it attracts both tourists and locals who go out for morning and evening swims. The hotel provides complimentary beach mats and towels and the Friday night fireworks display in Honolulu is spectacular viewed from the beach. There's a laundry facility on-site, the building boasts two fast elevators and the staff are friendly and responsive. Parking is valet only, there is metered parking across the street at the park but we opted for the convenient valet at $20/day which is actually a good deal on the island. The stroll down the beach walk along the water to Waikiki passes by one of the local parks, a beautifully kept park where locals barbecue and sunbathe. Other reviewers mentioned homeless people in the park and there is a small contingent of them but we always felt comfortable. I'd be cautious walking through most any park at night and this was no exception, however, walking by the park on either the beach or street side at all hours felt safe, with lots of people always out and about and walking around too. The New Otani Kaimana is close to Diamond Head and easy to navigate to other destinations on the same side of the island.

You can walk past the adjacent park into Waikiki for dinner, shopping, etc. There is another very large park across the road from the hotel. It's all actually more lovely than I expected.With that said, some cons are as follows. The hotel needs renovation, which I think is now underway. Our room was comfortable enough, but needed updating. The bathroom toilet had a slatted door, ok but not necessarily private. (Housekeeping was good, though, with a tiny orchid placed on each pillow for turn-down service.) There is a lounge and restaurant adjacent to the lobby; the restaurant is ocean-front. We considered eating there once but turned away due to the extremely loud live music there--just way too much.More pros: The concierge and those at the lobby desk were helpful. Valet parking is expensive, but valets were quick and helpful. There are two washing machines and two dryers on ground level outside the hotel, which is a great idea if you want to pack lightly and wash clothes on your own. There is a store there also that sells very high quality beachwear. There is also a hair salon.If you want to find an inexpensive and local place to eat, try driving down Monsarrat Avenue. There are several sandwich places there, as well as a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. Bogart's eatery--very casual and hip--has breakfast and lunch selections.

Thus it's far from the noise and traffic of the main drags of Waikiki. It's right on the beach and has perhaps the best one of Waikiki. Indeed, it's about 20 minutes walk from the nightly high life of Waikiki... but if you're not into that kind of thing...- the service is absolutely impeccable and more: it's downright friendly, efficient and helpful. The hotel is quite moderately sized compared to the Chain Palaces, and the staff quickly know you by name and inclination.- my room - a single - was kept spic-and-span. Though the furniture was a bit 'dated' and 'tired', everything functioned very well. Though a 'cheap' deal, my room's pleasant balcony even had some sea-view. Excellent light-occluding curtains; and all electronics one might wish.- the in-house restaurant Hau Tree Lanai serves amazingly delicious breakfasts; and as far as I can judge the 'up-scale' Miyako Japanese Restaurant has got to be one of the very best in town. My dinner was absolutely superb.Highly recommended for service, location, and in-house services!","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","Stoic1948</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",104,5.0

Location near Diamond Head is very nice if you want the quiet end of the beach, as we did. A little hard to find through Waikiki's one-way traffic grid if you arrive after dark! We reserved the basic room but were upgraded to an efficiency room in the annex, which had the advantage of cooking facilities (minimal) and a partial ocean view but the disadvantage of stairs. On balance, it was very good. The annex rooms were comfortable & everything worked, but could use a little updating. I'd recommend this for a short to medium stay on Oahu, but if you're planning a long visit you're probably better off renting a condo. I'd return again on a short-stay basis.

The location is very nice -- a short walk to central Waikiki Beach, but far enough away to avoid all the commotion. The adjacent beach is public but very quiet.That said, this hotel is nowhere near the service and amenities offered by the New Otani hotels in Japan. The ""annex"" rooms, which are usually the cheapest, are outside walk-ups accessible only by a well-hidden staircase. We purchased a special rate which included ""free breakfast,"" but this was actually just a voucher for a very slim continental breakfast in the on-site restaurant. On our first morning there, there was a rain shower early in the morning which closed half of the restaurant -- apparently for want of a mop -- and led to an hour-long wait for breakfast. The rooms are old and in slow decay, though they have upgraded the TVs since some of the other critical posts were made on this site.All in all, a pretty good deal for Waikiki Beach, but you get what you pay for.","Tokyo, Japan","hibiyaparker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",22,3.0

We have been staying at the New Otani every one or two years for over 20 years because of its quiet location remote from the noise of Waikiki. In contrast to Waikiki, one can leave the windows open to let in ocean breezes at night. Other pluses are free parking in the park adjacent to the hotel, location on Sans Souci Beach, and a responsive and efficient staff. However, on our most recent trip these pluses were outweighed by several negatives. There are no nearby places to eat – the coffee shop at the hotel closed a few years ago - and the hotel restaurant is comparatively pricey. We stayed in a moderate (economy) category room, which was tiny and badly in need of refurbishing. The built-in furniture was in shoddy condition, the carpeting was old, the sliding doors to the balcony were difficult to open and close, the sink stopper did not work, and the view was blocked by a highrise building almost within touching distance.

For us, the location was great: right down the street from my elderly mother who we were visiting. On our first stay, we booked a junior suite. The room was well past its prime and not as clean as we'd have liked. The level of service was all over the map. Our best experience was at the lobby-level restaurant, where most (but not all) of the waiters, bus-people, etc. were warm and cordial, especially those of Polynesian descent. Least satisfactory were the front desk staff, who were haughty and irritable. We left feeling no desire to return.Several years later, we came back anyway because the location is so convenient for us personally. We will never go back again. Our travel agent booked us into the hotel annex because the main building was full. She was not told that there was no elevator. I checked the hotel's website and it does mention that the rooms are walk-up, though in small and easily-missed print. On arrival we were told that we had a third-story walk-up or nothing. We decided to brave it, and for four days we hauled our 22-pound grandson and all his gear (not to mention our own) up and down three floors. I imagine we could have found someplace in Waikiki with an elevator to take us, but at the time, with the little guy's best behavior starting to unravel, keeping the New Otani room seemed like the right call.  Just as before, most of the restaurant staff were delightful, particularly the Polynesians. And as before, the front desk staff was not very nice (with one exception). Again, our room was dowdy and not very clean. And the room configuration was weird: one had to stand in the middle of the room just below the bottom of the bed to watch the television. (We are not TV viewers so this did not bother us.) The shower mechanism was full of moving parts that never seemed to work together right. And just our luck, the employee and guest smoking area was right underneath our room, with a prevailing onshore wind -- right past our room. As a result, hanging out on the porch with our grandson (who needs clean air) was not always possible.Something I saw during our first visit but hadn't really thought about was the hotel's cultural orientation. New Otani is a Japanese brand that Japanese tourists look for when the travel overseas, as many Americans look for Hilton or Marriott when they travel abroad. The New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel caters to Japanese nationals, many of whom come as part of a tour. On our recent stay, I observed the hotel staff's interaction with the Japanese more carefully, and noticed that the staff seemed more friendly to them. I did not see a single Japanese in the hotel annex, slogging up stairs with luggage. I had the distinct impression that at the New Otani, it's Japanese first and haole second.I suppose this is understandable. Japanese tourists visit en masse, bringing a volume of revenue no business could really ignore. And it only natural that the hotel reaches out to its bread and butter clientele. It's the business the New Otani is in -- I can't expect it to change to suit my family's needs. But not being Japanese, we won't be staying there again.","Camarillo, California","Gordon1957</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Camarillo, California</strong>",11,2.0

The only drawback I'd say is that some of the rooms are kind of small and cramped, but out of the many times I've stayed there, I've only had one room that was too small. The other times I've gotten upgraded to a huge suite. Ask for Tararat when you check in, she is extremely nice and helpful!

There isn't enough space to say all the good things I'd like to say, so here's a brief recap...The hotel is at the far end of the Waikiki beach and Kapiolani Park, just on the other side of the Honolulu Aquarium (a must see). It's an enjoyable half-mile walk to the downtown area for shopping, restaurants, nightlife, etc... and then it's back to the peace and quiet of the New Otani..... we call it the best location in Honolulu. I should add that we are well acquainted with major hotels all over the world, so we have some basis when we say that the entire staff at the New Otani is tops for service, friendliness, and helpfulness. As for the hotel itself, it is not a large-box hotel like some of the major chains. This is simply a wonderful, quaint Island hotel that you would want or expect in this environment. While their bar & lounge area is small, the adjoining outdoor restaurant (Hau Tree Lanai), which touches the beach, is superb for breakfast, lunch or a romantic dinner. Even the locals frequent this spot. So, when not viewing the sights of Hawaii, our favorite morning activity is sitting outside for breakfast, having Kona coffee, reading the newspaper, and enjoying one of their delicious breakfasts…all while gazing out at the sands, only a few feet away….and that’s what I call paradise.","Madison, Wisconsin","Jacquestravels21</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Madison, Wisconsin</strong>",15,5.0

It is a medium-sized hotel RIGHT ON San Souci Beach, a 15 minute walk from the central Waikiki Strip. The decor is old-fashioned, but delightfully so. There is a small fish pond in the front, and the elevator looks like an elevator should look in a classy beachside hotel from the 70s. As with the rest of Hawaii, there are a lot of ""open-air"" spaces incorporated into the architecture. There is a fish pond at the front of the hotel, and a convenience store, as well as a few shops. This is useful because the nearest ABC (convenience store found ALL OVER Waikiki) is a ten minute walk away, through a large park. The quality of the room depends on which one you get, although there is a lanai (balcony) in every room. Some of the rooms are quite small and have a view of... their parking lot, or the hotel next to it.

It was stunning. There is complete and easy access to San Souci beach, and the concierge will even assign free towels and beach mats for hotel guests.

I loved that it was right on the beach (no crossing the street for us!) and the beach was a little protected so we could snorkel and not worry about big waves and surfers. The only downside was that to get to Waikiki, you have to walk past a park which while beautiful in the day, is home to a few homeless and can make for some uncomfortable walks at night.

Most of the reviews praise the location as being on the ""quiet side"" of the beach, that is technically true you are basically in a residential area which is about a 15 - 20 minute walk to the outer portion of the action in Waikiki, basically as far as I am concerned Waikiki starts at LuLu's. If you are content with the round trip then by all means, however midday in the hot sun about halfway there I often wished I had opted to stay a little bit closer. The Hotel itself is directly on the beach which is a rarity for its pricepoint, however I wasn't terribly impressed by the beach, you are basically right next to a public park and there are any number of unpowered watercraft in the water in front of the hotel which makes swimming out too deep a bit a pain, the beach I found to be rather crowded even though I was of the impression it was for hotel guests however there is no mechanism for stopping anyone from walking on, so it may very well just be an extension of the public beach. The rooms were dated, and I am not talking 1990's more like the 1970's which I would have no issue with except I found the bed to be rather uncomfortable and the rooms to be very small. I understand for the price you get what you pay for, but the room is basically a bed with a TV across from it and a very small bathroom,I am not one to complain about smaller rooms as long as they are small and comfortable, this one was simply small and smelt very musty and I just couldn't get comfortable, that coupled with the very thin walls which resulted in me hearing my neighbor discussing their plans for the next day with perfect clarity did not help matters. You are paying for the fact that its on the beach, and if that is what you want then by all means, but I would seriously consider spending the same money and opting to walk across the street in a more active area of Waikiki.","Toronto, Canada","Shivan_Dragon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",71,2.0

It was an ocean-view deluxe room.First the negative:Renovations: The hotel and staff bills itself as newly renovated. Well, the carpet is new, and the bedding was fresh and comfortable, but that's about it with new renovations. The bathroom has peachish/pinkish colored tile with pink grout. The bathroom's wallpaper is pink and green, and the sink has a formica-like countertop over a painted plyboard cabinet. The bathroom's renovation hasn't happened since the 1980's. I feel a little duped by the hotel's website that states, ""newly renovated"", and shows picture of granite counters, etc... I wish they would be upfront and honest in their ads, and state not all rooms have the complete renovations pictured....when I called to confirm my reservations, the receptionist even stated specifically that all rooms have been newly renovated. A more honest statement would be all rooms have been at least ""partially"" renovated. The common areas of the hotel, atrium, etc... also do not appear to be newly renovated. The atrium has painted cinder block, the lobby has plain furniture that is outdated and worn. This hotel needs an infusion from an investor of 50 million or so, and it could be a premiere hotel. The potential is there...but, the investment just hasn't been made.Coffeemaker: There is not a coffeemaker in the room. Called the front desk, and one was brought up quickly. However, on the third day, the hotel did not leave any coffee for the coffeemaker. And, when we called the front desk again, we were told we had to request coffee on a daily basis? Really? What good is a coffeemaker without coffee? However, each of the remaining days, we were provided coffee, without having to further request it.Staff: The maid service was exceptional, and they were all very friendly and personable. But, all other staff at the hotel, front desk, travel, etc... were very lackadaisical. Most of the staff are Asian, and many of the clientelle are also asian, so maybe this is a cultural difference. But, from the pricepoint of this hotel, I expected a few more smiles and pleasantries. No one was rude. But, no one went out of their way to be friendly or helpful.Location: To get between the Waikiki strip and the hotel, you have to walk on the sidewalk near the street to get around the park, or the sidewalk near the ocean to get around the park. No biggie, except there are MANY homeless people camping out in Kapiloani Park, and this is a bit disconcerting at night. There are many signs in the park that says no overnight camping, tents, etc... but, obviously those laws are not enforced as there are tents, umbrellas and sleeping bags there at all hours of the night with people in them. I will say, I was never accosted, no one ever begged for money...and, I never felt specifically threatened. There was also always quite a few tourists out and about, so maybe there is safety in numbers. But, I am a guy, and am in shape, etc... I would be concerned for women and older folks walking through.Natatorium: Our room looked out at the ocean, park, Waikiki and the Natatorium. The Natatorium was once a grand WWI monument but now it is in a bad state of disrepair. From our room we could specifically see the holes in the concrete deck, the wooden plyboard partially covering the holes and the warning signs to keep out, etc... I hope the city renovates this historical place but, at the present it is an eyesore. Add, the eyesore to the homeless camped out and it is not an inviting picture.Restaurants: I ate breakfast and dinner at the Hau Tree. It was not necessarily to my liking. Amazing view. The service was o.k. Dinner cost 150.00 for two with drinks. Breakfast 50.00 for two. At this price, I expected a lot better food and service. I also ate dinner at the Myoku Restaurant. It was again about 150.00 for two with drinks. However, it was very good and the waitresses were dressed in Kimonos, which was a nice authentic touch. The view is amazing. But, the restaurant looked like some cheap Chinese restaurant off of the interestate. Again, it was probably last decorated in the 1980's. Atmosphere was disappointing. Obviously, the pictures for the internet were tweeked again to make it look a little more up to date than actual. And, for $150.00 I expect a nicer place.Internet: After spending several thousand dollars at this hotel, restaurant, parking and room, you would think they would print your airline boarding pass for you...but, nope...had to pay $5.00 at their money taking computer. Come on guys...this seems a little petty. Really you couldn't have spared a piece of paper?Late check out: Our red-eye flight was delayed to an 8 p.m. departure. I requested a late check-out of 4:30 p.m. , which the hotel accomodated. Eventhough there was no one booked for my room for that evening, they still charged $150.00! Again, really? I spent several thousand dollars with you, and you are still charging that much to stay a few hours later? Come on, where is the value added touches that you could provide?Now the good:This is the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in. I never heard the neighbors above us, or to the sides, the whole time we were there...except when I was on the balcony and they on theirs! Seriously. Fantastic. The room was comfortable. It was small as others have stated, but it had ample storage. There was a built -in chest of drawers with five drawers, a small closet with a shelf. A built in for the refrigerator, which had a drawer above. There were shelves over the sink. There was a cabinet under the sink for your toiletries to be nicely put away, and there was shelving near the bed. So, once the luggage was unpacked, the room was very comfortable for two people, and always seemed tidy because of the fantastic storage. The bed and linens were very comfortable. The maid service turned down our bed every night and put a small flower on the pillow. That was very nice. But, they also straightened up the room, and replaced towels, etc...So, we effectively had maid service twice a day. How cool is that?In my opinion San Souci is the best beach on the Waikiki strip. And, this is evident by the number of locals that were also using it. The beach was sandy, (other parts of Waikiki are rocky). There is a natural reef not far out, so the water is calm, and there is good snorkeling. And, this hotel is right on the beach...so, easy to run to your room for a break, and then right back out.The location of this hotel is also fantastic, (except for the homeless in the park)....I love the fact that the hotel was a 10 minute stroll from the strip. We could enjoy all the restaurants, night-life, shopping, and happenings on the strip, and then quickly retreat to our quiet hotel. What a treat...the best of both worlds. The view was breathtaking, (except for the neglected Natatorium). Lying in bed we looked out over the ocean, and could see part of Waikiki. From other vantage points in the room, you could see the park, and residential areas of the city, etc...It was so cool to observe the happenings of the Waikiki Strip, and at the same time the calm and quiet of the ocean. This is my 4th trip to Honolulu, and at this pricepoint, overall has been the best value for the price. It is not a Lodge of the 4 Seasons, or a ""W"". But, it is quiet and very clean. It could be exceptional with some more renovations and more personable staff....but, I guess that would change the pricepoint.I will definitely stay here again. And, would definitely recommend this hotel to friends. Albeit, if the walk through the park is a concern to you, I would suggest taking a taxi, which would be a minimal charge from the strip to the hotel....as it is hardly half of a mile in distance.I hope the city works on the Natatorium and the homeless population. And, I hope the hotel works on the staffing and renovations, with these tweeks....it could be a premier location and hotelTip to those visiting Oahu. The Waikiki strip is fantastic...and a lot of fun. But, definitely rent a car and check out the other parts of the island....particularly Lanikai and the North Shore....a whole different vibe, less touristy and pristine beaches. Hike Pali Lookout, and checkout the rainforest hikes....beautiful",Dallas,"jvmaddux</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas</strong>",164,4.0

Location is great; easy walk to hustle and bustle of Waikiki yet quiet in immediate area of hotel. Beach at hotel is very nice. Hotel has beach amenities such as, towels and chairs, nice outdoor restaurant, and on premise laundry. VERY comfortable beds! There was an $18.00/day fee for parking (pretty typical for Honolulu).

The room was adequate but agree with other reviews that it is outdated. Rooms were clean and bathroom was okay. We had our own veranda too. It was very amusing to see that the hotel staff was majority filipinos. As a filipina, it was nice having them treat my son so well. Hau Tree is a cool place very refreshing place to sit and watch the waves. Breakfast was alright and check out was not a problem.

This was our first time to Hawaii and we were looking for a quieter place. We were found what we were looking for at the New Otani Kaimana. Upon check in to our room we immediately smelled smoke! The prior occupants had smoked in the room even though the entire place is smoke free. Our bellhop knew this also and called down to get us another room. Upon entering it was great - except it had two double beds! A quick trip to the front desk had us back on our original floor (8 of 9) and upgraded to a Jr. Suite at no charge! We were well pleased. The staff aired out our original room for two days before anyone was put in it. This smaller hotel offered a nice beach that took only a minute to reach from our room vs the other mega-hotels farther down the beach. We walked downtown several times taking only about 10 minutes to get there. Our room rate included breakfast and we were able to order anything on the menu. We were charged any additional amount over the $14 allowed for the ""standard"" American breakfast, but usually only amounted to a few dollars. We rented a car and the parking ($18/day) cost more than the car did, but we found it very useful. We explored all over and put 350 miles on it in a week. The weather was very windy while we were there, but the Waikiki side of Oahu was well protected. We will definitely return and stay again.","Coon Rapids, Minnesota","gspielman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coon Rapids, Minnesota</strong>",20,5.0

Daily morning paper, beach towels and mats provided. Just steps from an interesting beach. Staff is young, enthusiastic with positive attitudes; they really tried to make the guests comfortable. Guest laundry facilities available on site. The fact that construction was going on between 9AM to 5PM on our floor was distressing, especially since nobody warned us ahead of time. There was no concierge; there was no clothes drying line in the shower/bath. A screendoor to the balcony would have helped. The San Souci occluded our Diamond Head view; but we had a nice sliver of sightline to see the beach and the ocean. We did appreciate the cleanliness and the attentiveness to our tiny room. We had guests visit us a couple of nights at the hotel; there is no real lobby, just a nice breezeway with little privacy. We got in vehicles and went to Lucy's and had fun; hey, if Lucy's is good enough for our POTUS, we can enjoy it with out guests, too.

I'm not sure what these other reviews are talking about when they say things like ""outdated"" or ""bad service"". Our room was beautiful, albeit small. But the size of the room didn't matter ... we only slept there. We spent most of our time enjoying what Oahu has to offer. If you're going on vacation only to spend time in your room, then go to Wisconsin or something ... don't go to Hawaii.The staff was fabulous! The breakfasts at the Hau Tree were wonderful! Everyone there was friendly and helpful and we had NO surprise charges. For the people saying they were unhappy with the ""not previously communicated"" parking charges ... the parking charges are listed on New Otani's website, and if you don't want to pay for parking, you can park for free across the street. One thing I would tell people about visiting Honolulu, especially if you've never been: if you rent a car, invest in a GOOD road map and STUDY it before you go. The streets there are nuts ... they change names without warning and many are one way.Also: MAKE SURE YOU VISIT THE NORTH SHORE! Snorkeling is WAY better at Shark's Cove on the North Shore than it is at Haunauma Bay. In Haleiwa, visit Killer Tacos and the North Shore Smoke Shop ... awesome, awesome, awesome.

If there was a downside for us personally it would be that there wasn't any entertainment at the hotel at all, out of the 2 weeks we were there I believe there were 2 nights we had a gentleman playing a guitar at the bar and that was it.

The New Otani is situated in the shadows of Diamond Head, so is about a 10 minute walk from Waikiki proper which means you're close enough for convenience and far enough away for total relaxation!When we arrived we were checked in quickly and shown up to our room. All the staff throughout the stay were so friendly, from reception staff to wait staff to maids.

Some good things about the hotel...is that you are on the edge of Waikiki. So, you are separated from the major crowds of tourists but you are close enough to venture in with a 10-15 min walk. You are close to Diamond head as well but without a car it's still a 45 min walk to get into the crater and then do the trail of Diamond head. The beach is nice and not crowded. You have a nice reef right in front of the hotel to snorkel or waves to surf. In general, the rooms were clean and the staff polite. We had a Ocean view...so it's hard to complain too much about the room.Some bad: The rooms are small. I was sharing a room with a friend, so we wound up having to share a king, which was two twins pushed together. Not a big deal if you're just sharing the bed with a friend but I would be annoyed if I was sharing the bed with my husband and you can feel the crack from the two twin beds from being pushed together. The bathroom is small as well and a bit outdated. The showerhead is not that adjustable for positioning between someone tall/short and the pressure is weak. Which is frustrating when you're trying to take a showerfrom being all sandy in the beach. Probably my biggest complaint is that the hotel bar closes at 10pm and they do last call at 9:45pm. That is just ridiculous! Especially when the hotel is hosting your conference. You cannot go down to the bar and have a beer while talking to colleagues. The room for the conference is okay for small speciality groups (max. 100 pple). The screen is small, just a pop-up screen with a stand. So, if you are not in the first coupld of rows it is difficult to see the screen. We had our banquet at the end of the conference and the food was good. The also have two restaurants, neither of which I ate at but the one is right on the beach and looked very nice atmosphere. But I would probably stay here again for a personal vacation (and just make sure my bed isn't two twins) but not for a conference.

In the future, I probably will stay elsewhere. For starters, the hotel sign is small and a bit hidden, which is easy to miss if you're unfamiliar with the hotel. I missed it the first time I passed it. I was told that it would be fixed with the big renovation occuring in 2010. Eighteen dollars a night for valet parking is ridiculous. On a side note, had I realized I was as close to downtown Waikiki as I was (about a 15 minute walk), I would not have rented a car. Unless you're going all over the island, you don't need to rent a car. If you don't walk to the downtown area, there's a trolley or buses are available. Back to the hotel. A plus is that the hotel is kept immaculate and you get complimentary beach towels and snorkel gear. On the negative side, my room had two beds, yet the closet was barely large enough for one person's clothes. The internet in the room was another item that was overpriced, causing me to seek out another hotel with much cheaper rates. Beyond the room, some other downsides for me included them allowing dogs on the beach and charging you to use the fitness center. A first. This was my second visit to Oahu, and being alone and on a budget, this is not a hotel I can recommend.",Chicago,"GetOutThere1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago</strong>",10,2.0

I wanted to dine on a shady veranda anytime I felt like it. I wanted prompt service and a warm welcome from every staff member. And I wanted a beautiful, quiet room with a generous balcony and a comfortable bed from which I could see both the city and the mountain lights.

Our room was big and great, but again, this was their most expensive room so I do not know about the others. The private beach is fantastic, the free towel and beachmat service was appreciated. The valet parking was expensive, but it at least guaranteed a parking space, something very treasured in waikiki. It is about a 15 minute walk to waikiki proper. At night the route through the park to get there is not lit and made me feel very uncomfortable.

The staffer at the desk basically ignored our inquiry and gave us a room with two twins, which we did not discover until we opened the door to the room. Apparently they had no more Diamond Head rooms w/larger beds, and would not give us the correct bed size in another section because they did not want to upgrade us. This is a huge issue for me. Perhaps I'm unreasonable, but when I reserve a queen or king, I expect it to be there. We had to wait while they sent up housekeeping staff to push the beds together and re-make the bed.

We had breakfast there every morning of our 5 night stay and wish we could be there again right now! It was difficult to leave and hope we can return some day.

We did some research using this site and wanted to stay away from the noise and crowds of Waikiki. It is perfect hotel for those who want to be close to the main drag of Waikiki but far enough to be quite when your relaxing. and the walking to Waikiki and the walk from hotel to top of Diamond head will burn off all the food you can consume -- so eat up and walk where you want to go.We had use of the beach just out side the hotel and the park next to it was nice as well. Note try snorkeling on hotel beach I saw plenty of cool looking fish right there.We ate at the restaurants there several times and love the location.

It is a little more than taxi but hey it is cool and spacious and the way to arrive and depart.#3 Take the shuttle to other sites like Hamana Bay and Pearl Harbor. Concierge there at hotel can make all the arrangements about $16.00 per person per trip#4 rent a car and go to north shore and Jump off the rock at beach and go and spend the morning at sunset beach ... then try shrimp trucks and have a shaved ice cone.#4 eat breakfast at Hotel restaurants #5 to relax and just unwind close to hotel ... Check out LULU'S good food and drinks and good live music too#6 My wife and I enjoyed two meals at the Hula Grill above Dukes in Waikiki... get there about 5;30 pm =Wait for a table along the rail and set and eat dinner while watching the sun set from an out standing location.Food is in large quantities so maybe share an Meal and leave room for huge desert portions.#6 If you want to try something different and like food take the Hole in the wall tour one of your first days.#7 from hotel walk to top of Diamond head 45 minutes to inside crater and 30 minute hike to top do it in the morning and it is a good hike and great view... there are taxis that will take you or bring you back but you still have to hike to top ... water and tennis shoes only if you are smart?#8 Don't try to do too much just relax and sit on beaches till you get sun burned than do out and eat well... repeat this often and have fun.#7 We like this end of the Island and would recommend this hotel and location.,TROPHY CLUB TEXAS,"JESUSFOLLOWERS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>TROPHY CLUB TEXAS</strong>",53,5.0

We were absolutely thrilled to be visiting the islands and had planned quite the gauntlet for the days that followed our stay in Oahu. We traveled to four individual islands during our trip, begining with our stay at The ""New"" Otani near Waikiki. The hotel's location wasn't bad, it was a few miles down from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, nestled right under Diamond Head crater. I wasn't too thrilled with the $18 per day parking charge that was not communicated prior to the stay, but whatever, parking fees do not really surprise me these days. My issue with this hotel is their absolute lack of customer service and the unbelievable extreme to which this hotel is mis-managed. They mistakenly upgraded our room. There was no communication of this as the bill that was signed when we checked in had the original fee listed with our reservation. We inquired upon this with a phone call after we made it to the room. We were not told anything, in fact, the receptionist said, ""I have no idea what you are talking about, I'm sorry."". Terrible.The hotel itself was decent. I would not stay there again. The room we were in must have been one of the nicest in the hotel (the ridiculous charge that I will get to in a second), and that is not saying much. In a way, I'm happy they screwed up because I would have probably been shocked had I been forced to stay in any other accomodations. That said, the hotel is away from the crowds of Waikiki, so that is one positive thing. But I really take nothing positive away from our stay due to the ridiculous error made on their side regarding our reservation. We were called on the day we were to check-out by some lady claiming to have just returned from vacation. She said she had reviewed our bill and needed to add some charges. These charges totalled $1,500. I kid you not. There was no effort by their staff, management, ownership to remedy or rectify anything. They illegally charged the account without signature or allowance to do so, and when called about it - they did not budge. Absolutely stay away from these thieves. There are nicer places to stay anyways. A confirmation and your initial signature means nothing to this hotel - they charge you as they please.

The food here is amazing, especially the fish and seafood. We opted for a Ocean View Deluxe Room but they upgraded us for free to a Ocean Front Room. The private lanai stretched the entire length of the room and turned the corner to extend along the other side, so there was a complete ocean view, and then a view of the city lights the other way.

So since relocating to the mainland east coast, we now get back to friends and family at least a couple times a year and have stayed recently at several places from the higher end Outrigger Reef, Moana Surfrider, and Hawaiian Village, to the trendy boutique newbies like Renew and Wyland (now Courtyard) referred by our circle. But this was our first stint at the New Otani, which a gal pal from Seattle had tipped me about several years ago....(Mahalo Jo!)The positive T/A reviews are spot-on regarding room layouts, decor, amenities, and overall property condition but in the end, staying here is all about choice. If you are looking for a pool scene, nite-life, mega-resort activities, or beach-service pampering, this will not suit your needs. But if your druthers are hassle-free and relaxing aloha nestled on one of Oahu's best locals beach, that's just far enough away from the Waikiki din, you will find hard pressed to top the value this next-to-million-dollar-plus-Gold Coast Condo row brings....One of the best things about the hotel is the multiple options for accommodations at every price point from simple no-frills quarters to high-end suites. We opted for a Diamond Head Room, mainly because living size was larger in that price range and the cooling trade winds front that side of the hotel. The room was listed at 315 SF, which in Hawaii counts the outside covered lanai (deck), where we spent virtually every early morning having coffee in sun-splashed cool breezes, mesmerized by an unparalled view of Diamond Head. And yes the living space is tight--er, cozy as they say in positive speak--- but the window bank sliding door and a smartly placed mirror wall gave the room a more spacious feel, which seemed to get even bigger as the week progressed. TIP: ask for a higher floor on the Diamond Head side so your view of Kapiolani Park is not obstructed by trees.Otherwise the walk to Waikiki action is about 20 mins.....Kapiolani Park is what any major city park balances in terms of challenges, but in the four years I lived here and the many times I have visited, I don't have any negative experiences to share.....and the Gold Coast is indeed the sweet spot on the island, especially Kaimana Beach, which has a sandy shore break so you won't need deal with foot coverings for rocky shoal. TIP: while towels and beach mats are free at the bell desk, head to Longs in nearby Kaimuki and for about $15 you can buy a decent beach chair.The on-site Hau Tree Restaurant is an island institution that rivals any beach-side setting, as does Miyako, the Japanese restaurant above which offers exquisite outdoor tatami dining perched over the soothing sounds of rolling surf. Note service stops before 9PM so you'll need look for late nite fanfare elsewhere. TIP: the adjoining bar shares the kitchen with the former and offers more reasonably priced pupus (small plates).Some of the minuses....our split system A/C did have an occasional drip, half the satellite tv stations were on the fritz, both the WiFi and ethernet connectivity was very poor and pricey, the queen bed is actually two full beds cluged together ala an ""european matrimonial"" configuration, and the hotel is showing its 60 year age upon closer inspection, i.e., fraying wall paper, slow sink drains, etc.Bottom-line: for thirtysomething-and-up no-frills couples who love the beach, are sans kids, and prefer a residential park-like setting to the usual resort-strip feel, this deserves a hard look. TIP: A Hawaii Statehood 50% discount special may still be running.....if so, opt for the Queen Kapiolani or New Otani suite at slightly more than a regular room rate.","San Francisco, California","Joe C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",96,4.0

The park is a huge source of entertainment in itself as there is always something interesting going on there. You can watch outrigger canoes and stand up paddlers in the water.There is a slight retro feel to the hotel, which gives you some sense of being in Hawaii at midcentury. The hotel hits all the important targets for me, and none of the superfluous ones. You will not miss a pool. Breakfast on the beach was a highlight of our trip.The staff is consistently sweet and helpful. They give you beach mats and fresh beach towels every day.

You can lie on your bed and look straight out at the dramatic view. If you want a slightly smaller, more inexpensive room, I would get the Waikiki view, as there is more glare from the ocean view and you will not be able to look out that way all the time.It is really nice to come in from your adventures and sit in the open air bar with a drink, and your kids are welcome there.On Monserrat, there is a great ""plate lunch"" place, the Diamond Head Market and Grill. Great quality, very healthy. That can really help keep your food bills down.If you are moderately fit, you can walk to Queen's Surf, the best beginners' body boarding beach. Or, park in the Zoo parking lot on Kapahulu.I would suggest bringing a large umbrella that will stay put. That's the only thing missing.One last tip: Get a massage from Yuko in the Jujube spa.

This is definitely the quieter end of a very lovely beach.We arrived from an early flight and were thrilled to find we were able to check in early. We booked the cheapest room category available which was about $150 i think - and yet we still had pretty good views of the ocean from the balcony, looking right. This was room # 323 and if you don't mind a slightly smaller room than some of the other categories then this is well worth your money.We had dinner at the Hua Tree restaurant and it was delicious. I also recommend the very yummy Mai Tai's they make. Watching the sun set capped off a lovely lazy day of not much more than paddling in the turquoise waters a few metres away. The staff at the restaurant here were unbelievable - so very attentive and courteous and just lovely.Room service was very expensive but there's a little corner store attached to the hotel which is a much better option for a meal or a snack. The high cost of room service is the only thing I can think of to knock points off!The front desk staff were very helpful and had some great suggestions for dinner. We walked to the Tiki Restaurant, 10 mins down the beach. There are 2 restaurants here in one building and we chose the cheaper of the two as we could sit al fresco and watch the sun set.

Everyone is so friendly there and that helps when you're first time travelers and women traveling alone at that. They made us feel so welcomed and took care of our every need while there. We ate at the Hotel restaurant for breakfast each day and by the second day they remembered us by name which was a great feeling! We felt like family! Hedy was our favorite waitress and she hugged us goodbye when we left. Marrissa was our housekeeper and was fabulous and so friendly. Everyone at the front desk and the travel desk (Tom and Joy) treated us kindly and we never felt like we were anything but valued guests. It was a wonderful experience and I would recommend this hotel highly.It was a little off the beaten path but close enough to enjoy everything the city has to offer. We took the bus #2 to downtown several times with the hotel's maps and instructions and totally enjoyed it. The Hotel has a convenience store on hand which came in really handy for things we forgot to pack. If you are looking for a great place to stay with a very personal touch than this hotel is for you!

The hotel is perfect for those who don't want to be on the ""main drag"" of Waikiki and are happy not to be seduced every five minutes by shopping at expensive stores for designer labels. Here, you'll find a fantastic restaurant right on the beach and feel the ocean breeze as you dine on excellent food and tropical drinks. We especially enjoyed our breakfasts and recommend getting the package that includes them. You'll eat here among many locals who come here for a good dinner or a business lunch. We chose the Diamond Head view room but upgraded for our last two days (we were here for four) to an ocean view suite, which was fantastic. Nothing wrong with the Diamond Head room, except that it is quite small and we wanted a bit more space. The upgrade was worth it and we highly recommend it if it fits your budget. (Unlike others on this site, we weren't able to get the upgrade without paying for it -- despite the poor economy, the hotel was quite booked!)

The location is perfect because it is away from the craziness of Waikiki, and it is nestled between the ocean and beautiful Kapiolani Park, walking distance to the Zoo and Aquarium, and with gorgeous unobstructed ocean views. I had booked an ocean view room for $315 but was unexpectedly upgraded to the Waikiki Suite on the top floor. It was a huge suite with two bathrooms, two closets, a living room, a wet bar and sitting area (for eating), and a separate bedroom. The private lanai stretched the entire length of the suite and turned the corner to extend along the other side, so there was a complete ocean view, and then a view of the city lights the other way. This must be the best suite in the hotel. Not everyone will get to stay in this suite, but it was a fantastic treat. The hotel is clean, beautifully decorated, and has the Hau Tree Lanai restaurant, which joins the sand and has beautiful entwined hau trees for shelter. The food here is amazing, especially the fish and seafood, which I ate at all four meals I had. Room service was prompt and food was hot. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful.

Right away we were greeted by the very friendly ladies at the front desk. We had asked about an upgrade to an ocean view room and was told it would be an additional $50.00 a night. We were glad to accept the offer because we had called just before leaving for our trip and was told it would be an additional $160.00 a night. We had already found the hotel at $135/night on hotels.com, so we were excited to have the upgrade for $50/night. We accepted and told the receptionist about our horrible experience in Atlanta where our plane was delayed 4 hours due to a fuel leak and we spent 13 hours on the plane. She kindly upgraded us again for the same price to an Ocean View Deluxe which is considerably larger than the regular Ocean View. You can check out the rooms and sizes on their website. The staff was very friendly and our room was cleaned twice a day. We did not get to experience the fresh pineapple in the fridge as some reviews stated. I'm assuming because we did the upgrade at the last minute which we were ok with. The view was absolutely beautiful and worth the extra $$$. The room was very clean. Some fraying of the wallpaper in the bathroom but nothing serious. The hotel was very quitet and we never heard anyone in neighboring rooms. We slept with the lanai door open every night. The walk into town from our hotel was about 15-20 mins depending on how fast you walk. My husband and I did not mind the walk, as we saved a bunch on not renting a car. The Ala Moana shopping center is a little farther than we cared to walk, but most of the stores at that center are in town as well anyway. You can get a bus route information sheet at the hotel if you care to take the bus. It's $2.00/person I believe. We never quite figured out the trolley system, but that is a means of transportation as well. I think the pink trolley takes you to Ala Moana Center. If you're up for a walk, we recommend Diamond Head Crater, which is only $1.00 admission. We walked from the hotel but took a taxi back for about $10.00 We took two tours which picked us up at the hotel and dropped us back off. Pearl Harbor and Big Island Circle tour. If you don't mind spending the extra money we also recommend taking a taxi to the hotel from the airport and back. It's around $35-$40. We made the mistake and took the shuttle which was $9, but we spent another hour on the shuttle. We were dropped off last because the New Otani is away from town and all the big hotels and restaurants and shops. There were homeless people in the park across the street and under the picnic shelters in town but they never approached us and seemed to just stay to themselves. There are street performances each night. The best one is Basketball Man and I can't quite remember where he sets his show up, it is somewhere on the main street, Kalakaua Ave., and he is really worth watching. They come out just as it starts to get dark. We recommend The Shack for lunch or dinner which is quite a stroll from the New Otani, but totally worth it. Go before 8:00 p.m. though or you get charged a $10.00 cover charge because they have a band. The food and service are excellent. Cheeseburger in Paradise has good food too.

The hotel is located near San Sousis Beach, about 10-15 mins walk away from Waikiki. Had we had more time it would have been nice to enjoy the peace and quiet near the hotel. However, since we had limited time a more central hotel would probably have been more convenient. We arrived late in the evening at around 10. We were tired after the long flight and very hungry. Unfortunately, the hotel restaurant had already closed and we did not have the energy to walk and find a restaurant. Therefore we had to go to sleep on an empty stomach. Thankfully we found some pineapple waiting for us in the fridge. :)Our room was upgraded to an ocean view room which was a pleasant surprise. We couldn't see much in the evening of course but when we woke up in the morning the view was spectacular. The room was comfortable although not very big. We ordered room service for breakfast to enjoy the view from our balcony. The food was good although not very filling (considering we were still hungry from the previous night) and quite expensive. When we came back to the hotel after the cruise, the room was the same size but not with the same view. We were on the other side with a partial view of Diamond Head.

The beach is about 2 blocks away and easy to find. We found the Wyland way more updated. Friendly staff, very clean hotel and very comfortable beds. Oh yeah, the bed at the New Otani was very firm. The Wyland offered more amenities (like free internet) at much lower price per night. Pool and hot tub were nice. New Otani no pool or hot tub.

Our room was six floors above the back of the restaurant, which was kept clean, but was loud in the morning. The electronic room keys required patience and, occasionally wouldn't work on the locks. The staff would cheerfully make us new room keys. The cost to use the internet was, if I remember correctly, $11/day or $55/for a week. The cost to use the valet parking lot was $18/day. None of these issues would prevent me from staying at the New Otani again.Tips: If you want to forego the valet charges, there is definitely parking on the street, outside of the hotel but I did not want the inconvenience of searching for a spot.

She narrowed it down to two hotels, this one and the up market Royal Hawaiian hotel (aka Pink Palace). As it was our first visit to Hawaii, we opted for the Royal Hawaiian Hotel for a touch of luxury at $530 plus tax sea view room per night. After a wonderful week staying at the Aloha Pualani Hotel (a real gem) in Kihei, we moved into the Royal Hawaiian and were stunned because the renovations were still being completed and the noise was pretty horrendous. Our room was nice, but certainly not worth $530 a night plus tax. The hotel was very good in understanding that our needs were not being met and we decided to move out and go to our original second choice the New Otani at the other end of Waikiki.On first impressions you could see that this was a different class, we were smoothly checked in, after booking direct on Expedia two hours earlier, we paid $935 for three nights in a deluxe Ocean view room.The rooms are okay, and in reality they could do with a bit of a face lift, but, once they do that I can see the prices going up considerably. The previous review from walkoutdoors1997 pretty well summed up our experience.For some the walk into Waikiki might be a bit far, but it was not for my wife and myself, who could worry about walking along the beach at Waikiki, there are much worse walks in life. It only takes about ten minutes before you start getting to the shopping area, and if its that big a deal, take a Taxi or pay a couple of hundred bucks extra a night and stay in the centre of Waikiki.The beach in front of the hotel is excellent, even on a busy sunny Sunday, there was plenty of room (my pictures were taken on a Sunday).We ate at the wonderful Hau Tree Lanai restaurant one evening, its great food, and very healthy compared to many of the restaurants in Waikiki, we paid about $100 for two main courses (fish) and a bottle of wine, which was okay. We also ate at the Japanese restaurant upstairs, which was excellent too, great Sushi.Just to agree once again with walkoutdoors1997, we did notice the homeless people near to the Aquarium, and its true that they did not bother us at all, during the three days we stayed at the New Otani, so dont let that put you off.In general the hotel is very good, the staff are well trained and the food quality is exceptional.

My parents and I had stayed at the New Otani during a previous visit to Oahu, so we were familiar with the location and hotel. We knew it would be the perfect place for our guests to stay as well as for our reception.From the beginning, we told our guests that the rooms would be small. When my parents and I stayed at the New Otani a few years ago, we had an oceanview room with a cot crammed into it. It was not a pleasant experience. This time around, we informed all of our guests that the rooms would be small but that it was an oceanfront boutique hotel at an affordable price. We had a variety of rooms at all price levels--the majority of our guests were in Moderate rooms, but a few had Oceanview or Diamond Head view rooms. My husband and I had an Ocean Front (317) room, and my parents were upgraded to an Ocean Front Junior Suite (718) room. All of the rooms were impeccably kept. The chilled pineapple in the fridge upon arrival was the perfect touch.I agree with previous posts regarding palm trees obscuring views. If you want a view, request a room on a high floor. We had a wrap-around balcony that had a great view of the ocean as well as a very good view of Waikiki. It was partially obscured by the palm trees, but I'm scared of heights and refused to have a higher room. Our view was wonderful, but if you're adamant that you want the perfect view, request to be higher up.All of our guests loved the rooms and the access to the beach. The service at the front desk was wonderful; the staff was also willing to help us out and offer us some aloha spirit. I am forever in gratitude for their kindness.Quite a few of our guests ate many meals in the Hau Tree Lanai and enjoyed it immensely. I had one breakfast there, and it was perfect. We also loved the little snack counter in the annex that has spam musubi and chicken rice balls. My husband and I ate way too many of these! I wish I had had time to try the organic shave ice syrups--they sound way too good. It is a fair walk into Waikiki, which is either good or bad, depending on your perspective. We walked through the park at night and never felt concerned over our safety. You're at least a 10-minute walk from the closest ABC Store, which in Waikiki is a rarity. However, the New Otani has its own little snack counter and shop where you can purchase food.We worked extensively with Lisa to plan our reception, and it went off without a hitch. Our wedding was in Waimanalo and coordinated separately, but Lisa and the Hau Tree did an incredible job. The florist had dropped off a beautiful centerpiece, and the Hau Tree set it out for us. Our musician, Doug Fitch, was recommended by Lisa and performed slack-key guitar music perfect for the occasion. My mother had ordered appetizer trays in advance, and they came out quickly once our guests arrived. The Hau Tree was also very accommodating with special requests. I wanted a pasta dish but don't eat shrimp, so the Hau Tree prepared me a special chicken-mushroom pasta instead. It was very, very special. They did a fantastic job in handling our reception, and we will always recommend them to anyone.My only unhappy experience at the New Otani wasn't actually related to the New Otani itself. A few hours after our reception at the Hau Tree had finished, my father-in-law and his girlfriend decided to have a ""commitment ceremony"" with a minister on the 2nd-floor balcony directly below our room--specifically after we had asked them not to do so. The result of this was that they made the rest of our time at the New Otani very uncomfortable and awkward for the rest of our guests and ourselves. Luckily the staff of the New Otani was very kind to my husband and me through this incident, and we hope to stay there again in the future under very different circumstances.",FL,"kaeller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>FL</strong>",7,5.0

There were just a couple minor irritations. The biggest problem was the lack of a proper bathroom door. The door was akin to a door-sized window shutter that slid shut. It was just a bit uncomfortable to have little to no privacy while using bathroom. The room was quite small, which made the lack of a proper bathroom door much more irritating. Our room had a built in desk, mirror, closet and TV stand on one wall and the rest of the room was completely taken up by the queen-sized bed, with very little room to move around. If while traveling, you prefer a spacious room, this may not be for you, though they did manage to squeeze a very large flat screen TV in the room. That aside, everything else was great. The restaurant was top-notch and the outdoor seating area gave you the feeling that you were eating on the beach, which was nice. The lobby was also very well decorated. Also, the view from our room was great as we had a great view of the ocean and the park next door. The staff were very polite, but we really didn't interact with them too much so can't really give an opinion on them either way. As for the location, it is on the beach and is approx. half of one mile away from the area where most shops and hotels are located. The tours that we attended while in Hawaii didn't pick up from our hotel (not to say that others wouldn't) but asked that we walk down to the main street to meet at a larger hotel, which wasn't necessarily bad since we had nice weather, but depending on the weather, it could be a major inconvenience if you’re being picked up by tour companies. I would say that this was an average to above-average accommodation and is a good value for what you receive.","Oxford, Alabama","Passport53</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oxford, Alabama</strong>",152,3.0

I never ever wrote a hotel review in my life although me and my husband have travelled a lot and usually stay in 4 and 5 star hotels around the world. But after our trip to the New Otani I decided I had to. I chose the hotel because of a recommendation from a friend who raved about how secluded and beautiful it was although being in Honolulu. And she was right. At our arrival we were welcomed by the incredibly nice staff who even got us an upgrade for our room. The ocean view room (716) was just amazing, overlooking the sea, the secluded Sans Souci beach right in front of the hotel, Honolulu skyline and Kapiolani Park. If you stay here, get an ocean view room, it's worth it! Having breakfast and dinner (fantastic restaurant by the way!) on the lanai right at the beach without the feel of a huge resort or hotel complex - it couldn't get any better. If you like big resorts and pool areas this isn't for you. But if you want to experience this very private feel with an outstanding service, then come here. The waiters all looked like they really love their job. Isn't that what you wish for when you go out dining on your vacation - except the great food? Well, you figured it out, we enjoyed our stay there. When our flight was delayed, they even offered us a room to freshen up and stay in at no cost until we had to head to the airport at night. Great hotel and only a 7 minute walk to Honolulu center. Definitely more than a 3-star hotel!!!

The hotel is right across from the Kapiolani Park and the Sans Souci Beach is right behind the hotel. We loved the beach area - there is a lifeguard daily - there are no crowds - the beach is raked daily - you can even go snorkeling here. This is what they call a Boutique hotel - translation - the rooms are very small. We booked an ocean view room - the view was spectacular - Waikiki in the distance and to the side the beach and ocean. The air conditioning unit above the bed was a bit annoying. We did get to peak into an Ocean View Suite room while the maid was cleaning it - these are the rooms to get next time!!! Spectacular! You also get some fresh pineapple in your room upon arrival. We also got a box of chocolates because we told the front desk it was our 30th Anniversary. Now we only paid of valet parking the first night as we were too exhausted after our flight ($18) - the rest of the week we parked for free in the Kapiolani Park right outside our hotel. Now there is also meter parking on the street in front of the hotel - but there is a small road (sorry can't remember name) right to the side of the hotel where the lifeguards parking is next to the beach this is where we parked for free all week. The locals frequent this area on the weekends - so get there early if you want free parking. We loved the Hau Tree Lanai restaurant in the hotel for their food and especially for the fantastic view. Every time we ate there the staff put us at a beach front table. Very romantic. The Lounge area makes the best Mai Ti's in Hawaii and there is entertainment most nights. Getting a mat and towel were never a problem...the staff at this hotel were very nice and welcoming. The hotel does not have a pool...but the ocean is right out your door. Waikiki is a 25 minute walk from the hotel - there are a lot of trees for shade in the park but once you hit Waikiki it gets really hot! So if your looking for less crowds - free parking - great staff - beautiful views - romantic restaurant - quiet hotel - great price - close to all the major attractions stay here. I would stay here again - but I would book a Suite instead of a room. Oh ya, when we asked for an upgrade when we arrived - we didn't get one like other reviewers got that I read about - oh well...maybe next time.

The location is the strongest point for the hotel and mostly makes up for some weaknesses in the rooms. The hotel is located on a quiet stretch of beach slightly out of the craziness of Waikiki. It was about a 15 - 20 minute walk into shopping and the restaurants.  I had read the moderate rooms were small but wasn't prepared for just how small. You literally did not have enough space to turn around in the room! Also, I found the AC to be less than adequate.

At check in I asked for an upgrade from our Ocean View room (hoping for a Deluxe Ocean View) and we were given a Junior Suite (Room 318) without any hassle at all. Our room was on the same level as an open air garden in the centre of the hotel. A real unexpected surprise when we came out of the lift.During check in we were invited to the Manager's cocktail happy hour for Mai Tais and Pupus. The manager Jean-Pierre (JP) made us feel very welcome and the Mai Tais went down rather well. We unpacked and went straight out for dinner. On our return we noticed just how loud the A/C was and there was no way either one of us could sleep with that racket. Also quite a bit of loud talking and laughter was coming from the floor below. I thought it was from the bar but Reception said the bar was empty at that time. We were offered another room on the 8th floor (Room 810) which was much quieter and had a wrap around balcony with views back to Waikiki and over to Diamond Head. We were both quite grumpy and tired after having to pack up and move but we had our best night's sleep in 5 days. There was a small entrance way with a luggage closet containing the room safe. The bathroom was a little odd. One room contained the toilet and a shower over a bath and the hand basin was outside the bathroom next to the wardrobe. There was a Queen size bed in one room separated by sliding doors from the lounge area with a desk, couch and TV cabinet with mini fridge underneath. The view from the wrap around balcony was absolutely awesome. We slept with the drapes pulled back so we could look down toward the lights of Waikiki. The beach out front of the hotel is fantastic and was never crowded. It was quite shaded first thing in the morning but it didn't take long for the sun to come over the buildings. There are towels and sand mats available at the Bell desk. The entrance to the beach is just to the right before the bar and there is a tap at the top of the ramp to wash off the sand before going back into the hotel. You can not get back in the door at the top of the ramp and have to walk down the side a bit.Breakfast was awesome under the Hau Tree. So relaxing that we could have stayed there all day. Not much else in the way of dining options. The dinner menu had quite an Asian influence and there was also a Japanese restaurant on the 2nd floor. There is a small convenience store attached to the hotel but we just wandered back into Waikiki for dinner.I was a little nervous during our walk back from town as there are a lot of homeless and 'strange' people in the park. There would be no way I would walk there alone at night. My husband had to look twice when he saw his first gay couple kissing but he got used to it very quickly so it wasn't an issue. I had forgotten to tell him it had the reputation as the gay end of Waikiki. No big deal.Overall our stay at the New Otani was everything I expected it to be in terms of peace and quiet (eventually). I would definitely go back tomorrow given the chance.","Christchurch, New Zealand","Fluffy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Christchurch, New Zealand</strong>",90,4.0

Our travel agent helped us with this one. We stayed five nights. The first room we were given was a shoe box. My agent said it was small but we never thought it would be as small as it was. It was an ocean front with a balcony and a king size bed but you literally had to inch around the bed because there was no room for anything else. Even the closet was small. There was no way that we could have even fit half our luggage in it. So we upgraded. The unfortunate part about that is that the only room available to us was an additional 120 a night. Ouch! We took it thinking something else would come available in the mean time. I believe that room was on the corner. It was definitely worth the extra money. It was beautiful. If you can afford it I would suggest staying in that room. By this time we had gotten our agent on the phone, thank goodness. They got us in a room about double the size of the first one for only 40 more a night. We loved it. The view was perfect and the size of the room was as well. If only we would have went with that one to begin with we would have been way better off and way less stressed. The service at this hotel was very good. They will do anything to try and get what you need. The restaurant down stairs was superb. The waiter was really nice and gave us a good tip on where to hike. He even got us a brochure for it. It was nice being away from all the hustle and bustle. But not too far. Every night we would walk through the park and down the strip and back. Or we would just walk along the ocean by Waikiki beach. And during the day all you had to do was walk out the door to get to the ocean. It was neat to see all of the early birds down by the shore doing their morning exercises. Over all I would recommend this place to anyone who asked. Staff was great and once we got into the right one the room was great too. Just make sure you check the size before booking to prevent a little stress.","Buffalo, NY","nicki793</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Buffalo, NY</strong>",3,4.0

Incidentally, Kaimana is Hawaiian for diamond, and this hotel is definitely a gem. Built in the late-1940's on the site of the former McInerny Cottage, which was a tasteful Victorian design with an ocean lanai and wood railing under a distinctive hau tree whose shade was enjoyed by Robert Louis Stevenson. The distinguished tree and wood railing have been integrated into today's Kaimana's dining treasure ""The Hau Tree Lanai,"" an ideal venue for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It's the most relaxing oceanfront restaurant in Honolulu. Renovated in the mid-60's, when the nine story tower was added, it has a retro look on the exterior, but an open, breezy lobby which imparts a tropical feel. No pool, but Sans Souci is a great beach, replete with local eye candy.The Kaimana was acquired by the vaunted New Otani chain of Japan, which has thus far wisely kept the Hawaiian ambiance that insures it remains a standard amongst locals, both the native-born and kama'aina, for dining and receptions. For instance when returning from a morning jog around Kapi'olani Park under the port a chere I bumped into a law school schoolmate who was then serving as Lieutenant Governor. Close to the Honolulu Zoo, away from the hustle and bustle of mainstream tourist strip, and located past the Aquarium and the World War I Memorial Natatorium, the Kaimana brackets the Diamond Head end of Waikiki. It's a short, but picturesque drive from the shops, cinemas, and restaurants of Kahala Mall. Location is probably why the property imparts a club-like, but casual, air of exclusivity. New Otani has avoided the mistake of overdeveloping their site. While hardly bargain priced, its prices provide better value than Honolulu's two grande dames further up Kalakaua Avenue. As a result there exists is a wide diversity of accommodations in the Kaimana's inventory. The corner suites are to die for, most of the junior suites are enviable, but they also have some rooms which afford hardly enough room in which to open one's suitcase. The GM, Jean-Pierre Cercillieux, has a colorful leadership reputation that no doubt inspires his staff. On our recent stay we encountered a reservation glitch, and an Internet disconnect. In each case the staff quickly and cheerfully addressed each problem. However, we're still waiting to confirm if we received our WorldPerks bonus points. Overall the location, view, beach, service, and food combine to make this gem at the foot of Diamond Head a ""home away from home"" to which the members our family enjoy returning.",On the road,"GeorgeFarris</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>On the road</strong>",73,4.0

It's at the far end of Waikiki with a marvelous swimming beach (Sans Souci) right out the door. Quiet, out of the busy part of Waikiki, but a 15-20 minute walk away if you're missing the action. I booked a Deluxe Ocean View room on Travelocity for $183 plus $43 taxes and fees. Before I checked in I made myself look very presentable, (business casual) and fresh (after a long 5 hour full plane flight crammed into a tiny coach seat) and had my cool new Tumi suit case and was given an upgrade to a junior suite. It was a great room with a small living room that had a sofa, desk and flat screen TV. There were sliding doors that separated the bedroom. Best of all there was a wrap-around balcony with views of Waikiki beach AND Diamond Head. There is a smaller building that is also part of the hotel and although some of the rooms ini this small back building have beach views, some look out onto the parking lot. I would really spend the extra money and get an ocean view in the main building. For the price of a dinner I had chosen to upgrade to a deluxe ocean front, and by luck was upgraded. The way the main building of the hotel is oriented it looks like most rooms have a view of either Diamond Head, the beach, or out to the ocean. The hotel has many Japanese guests and there are nice Japanese touches in the rooms, like kimonos and a tea service, including a small tea pot with matching cups. I had breakfast at the hotel's outdoor Hale Tree restaurant but was not too impressed. Too much waiting, coffee not very good, kind of expensive but then again, I was right on the beach. I preferred the little shaved ice place downstairs where I got a great cup of coffee and a muffin for $4. We had dinner in the Miyako, the Japanese restaurant on the second floor. VERY Japanese and not for everyone. The sushi was very good, super fresh fish, delicious tempura. We were the only English-speaking Americans in the restaurant. It was $85 for 2. Back to the hotel room, it was very clean, the bathroom was a bit dated (some fraying of the wallpaper in the bathroom, some unattractive grout in the bathroom, thin louvred bathroom door which could be a little awkward but then I'm kind of scrambling to say anything negative) The amenities were by the French company Occitane , very nice! I would have liked a nice reading light, but the lighting looked attractive. Housekeeping was very prompt and thorough. The front desk staff is somewhat reserved in their demeanor. I think some people can take this as surly but I did not find it that way. They do not have forced smiles on their faces and they are very quick and efficient. This may be their style, there are a lot of Japanese guests, maybe that's the way they do things. It didn't bother me. For example, at the service desk they lend you straw mats, beach chairs and towels. We kept on getting mix ups because I would return the towels when no one was there, so it looked like I had 10 towels out when I had none. But it all worked out. A few last things: there is no pool (who needs one? the ocean is like a gigantic pool and it's right outside the door), the super cool W hotel is right next door which would be fun for a drink, parking is plentiful across the street, 25 cents an hour with a maximum of 4 hours, free from 6 pm to 10 am, or you could valet. Will definitely return to this hidden gem.","San Francisco, CA","kmostrach</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, CA</strong>",24,5.0

The hotel lobby is beautiful, with an open bay straight to the water. The room was small, but it was just my wife and I and we were not there for the hotel room. I wanted to get out, so it didn't bother me at all. As far as being antiquated, I couldn't tell. I could have marked it down for the a/c, but I didn't complain about it to maintenance since I could just leave the patio door open and get all of the ocean breeze I could stand. Beautiful view from the balcony also. I spent alot of time there. Parking is easily circumvented. $18 for valet or simply park right in the street for free. Across the street is free from 6pm-10am at Diamond Head park, and then you have to feed a meter. I don't recommend getting a rental car anyways. You're not going to see Hawaii in a rental car. You really need to get off of Oahu to do that. If you do get a car, only get it when you need it because Waikiki is within walking distance to get everything you need. To sum it up, I would definitely, and probably will, stay again. The scenery and comfort cannot be beat compared to the hotels I saw in Waikiki.

We made reservations by phone and got the internet discount as well as a week discount. We were in a Diamond Head room on the 6th floor – with a beautiful view of Diamond Head and Kapiolani park.The room was small but clean and attractively decorated in blues and greens. It had a small fridge as well as a couple of chairs and small table both in the room and also on the lanai. With the exception of a little noise from the street on Friday night, the hotel was very quiet. The hotel sits on the Sans Souci beach which is a perfect swimming beach. You can get beach towels, mats, and chairs from the front desk. There are lots of food options within 2 miles (we walked because it is such a pleasant walk along the beach or through the park although parts of the park can be a little isolated late at night). All the following are nearby: Leonard’s Bakery (for malasadas), Diamond Head Market (great take-out for breakfast, lunch, or dinner especially the grilled veggies), Rainbow Drive-In, Ono Hawaiian Foods (great chicken laulau), and of course all the restaurants in Waikiki (including the Hula Grill for breakfast). We also ate breakfast at the Hau Tree Lanai a couple of times and it is very scenic.There is a convenience store in the hotel, a Safeway less than 2 miles away on Kapahulu and, of course, ABC stores in just about every block along Waikiki, so it is easy to pick up anything you need. You can use the hotel’s valet parking or park on the street or at meters across the street (25 cents per hour 10AM to 6PM). If you are flying out late in the day you can arrange for late check-out or get a hospitality room for an hour to shower and change. The hotel has a coin-operated laundry.As the other reviews mention, the staff is pleasant and helpful. We loved being in such a peaceful and beautiful setting but still close to the activity of Waikiki.

We found this hotel through trip advisor and were quite please with our visit March 15-22. We were looking for a quiet spot off the strip to escape the spring break madness and the New Otani was the perfect hotel. Upon our arrival we received a free upgrade to a larger ocean front suite on the sixth floor (if you are booking it would definitely be worth the money for the ocean front view). The suite was clean and spacious, the bedding updated - there give a fresh piece of pineapple in your mini fridge. The San Souci beach is right below the hotel and is definitely a quieter beach versus the strip. This beach is definitely filled with more locals than tourists. The 15 minute walk to the strip was fine during the day. For personal safety, I wouldn't recommend walking alone during the night time - there are a few spots where there isn't much lighting or foot traffic. We always made sure to pick up late night snacks on the strip as the hotel restaurant closes at 21:00 and there isn't a restaurant nearby (although we did forget to explore the W hotel next door - they may have a restaurant). The staff were friendly and accommodating - they provided beach towels and straw mats upon request. Not once did we feel that the hotel was too busy or over occupied - it was only when we went to the strip that we remembered that it was spring break. We also rented a car for three nights and the $18 per night valet fee was reasonable. The Hau Tree Lanai restaurant provided excellent service and had very reasonably priced breakfast and lunch for the serving sizes ($10-15) - we had the poi pancakes every morning (a must have) and the mahi burger was the best fish burger I've ever had. On check out day, we had a late night flight and after the beach we were given access to a hospitality room to shower and change. The only downside was the equipment room (not part of the main hotel) they stored our luggage in for that day. When we picked up our luggage we noticed a few cockroaches wandering about (not a huge concern - just make sure you have all your bags tightly zipped up to prevent unwanted hitch hikers home).

We picked the hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. I did read some negatives, but we took the chance anyway and are so glad we did.The rooms: we had a ocean front junior suite. This had a small sitting room with a big screen tv and sliding glass doors that opened up to a decent size lanai and the bedroom with a king size bed and another sliding glass door to the lanai. The views of the beach and Waikiki in the distance were amazing. We were on the third floor. One could argue that some of the furniture wasn't new, but it was very clean and was just fine.The staff: couldn't say enough about them. Friendly smiles and hello's and there to help you with anything. When we first arrived we requested a coffee maker for our room, and it was delivered before we could finish looking at our room!The food: As far as we were concerned the food was top-notch and promply served. The portions were large and you could easily take some back to your room. (yes, there are mini-fridges in the rooms)The beach: Fantastic and great for snorkling. From our lanai you could see the coral reefs and not a day went by that people weren't taking advantage of swimming there.

I would highly recommend paying the extra money to upgrade to one of these rooms.The hotel is owned and run by the Japan-based New Otani Hotel Group, which virtually ensures impeccable and polite service.The hotel itself, including the rooms, are a bit dated, however, you really will not find another hotel in Waikiki with this proximity to the ocean, unobstructed views and balconies for a better price!","Honolulu, Hawaii","Kmalia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",88,4.0

I hit the cover off the ball on this one. I was put in the annex, number 309, which is the closest to the beach on the top floor. The porch(lanai) opens onto a beautiful park with a good view of the ocean. I asked to see some of the the other rooms in the main building and was cheerfully given the grand tour. All the rooms were clean and would have a hard time choosing between an ocean view(in the sun), or the spetacular view of Diamondhead(in the shade). I stayed with the annex room mostly because it had a microwave and sink(hotplates on request) where the rooms in the main building did not. I had a breakfast,poi pancakes with three different types of sausage and a side of potatoes obrian, almost more than I could eat and everything exceptional. I had one dinner there, mahi mahi over a bed of creamed linguini. The filet was huge, enough for a snack for the next day. The service here is top notch not only in the restaurant but front desk, easily the most beautiful women on the island, bell staff eager and respectful, maid service efficent and thorough. There is no need to rent a car as bus service goes everywhere, including the airport, for 2$ with one free transfer per day. The number 2 bus stops almost in front of the hotel right in view of a beautiful fountain. If you are 55 you can get a seniors discount if you call the hotel on their toll free number. The aquarium is just a chip shot away and the zoo just beyond that. The snorkeling was good in front of the hotel but better on the other side of the aquarium.

We had a small problem with the tub drain and there was a guy fixing it within about 10 minutes. The restaurant is excellent for any meal, but breakfasts just have something special about them. Many locals come to the hotel just to eat breakfast. In general, you get the feeling that you are staying in a fine hotel a couple of decades ago, before Waikiki became the totally commercial and over-developed place it is now.

The New Otani is probably the least expensive hotel that is directly on the beach -which means that you can walk out of the lobby onto sand -and it has great snorkeling. My wife and I were surprised to find a sea turtle in such a busy area as Waikiki. The hotel location was a short walk from the maddening crowds and though the surrounding parks had some homeless wandering around (like in Santa Monica, CA) we didn’t feel unsafe or uncomfortable. By the way, if you are a runner like me I could not think of a better place to stay to maintain you daily runs. Instead of playing the 'ocean view games’ we just decided to go for the least expensive room available. Internet rate of $135/night. Our room actually had a partial view of the ocean and Diamond Head. Perhaps it was a slow week and we got upgraded. The room was very small, a bit dated, but clean. My only gripe is that there is no door to the bathroom –only a sliding type louvered door. You better be very familiar with your traveling partner or you soon will be. The hotel is not fancy by any means but it was not a disappointment. It is just a reasonable clean place. We didn’t try any of the restaurants but did go to the fantastic Diamond Head grill at the W Hotel just 100 feet away.

The view itself was very gorgeous. and mesmerizing. I took a nap one afternoon with the screen door open and fell asleep listening to the ocean.

They had a microwave, dishes, a dining table with 4 chairs, large outside balcony, coffee maker and 4 large closets, a vanity station, and small shower. For the value, I suggest getting the 1 bedroom. I liked the fact that your hotel card key is used for each floor of the walk-up building, insuring better security. The location is perfect for a Waikiki Shell concert. Food wise, you should venture downstairs to have coffee and great baked goods (muffins, sinful desserts, etc). The restaurant downstairs has a great Sunday breakfast (hint: make reservations) and the food was a bit pricey, but worth it. My daughter ordered breakfast through room service and it arrived within 10 minutes. I have yet to experience any hotel beat this record time. The location being farther away from the noisy part of Waikiki is great because you are forced to walk at least 1/4 - 1/2 mile to the better restaurants. The food areas closer to the hotel are the local Starbuck's and Lulu's. Not to mention Teddy's Burgers. For parking, arrive early and park on the street (free parking) as there are many stalls near the hotel. The Sans Souci beach is much cleaner than the more populated part of Waikiki and is drop dead gorgeous. The hotel provides a small safe and internet service has to be ordered for a fee.

What may have killed the popular appeal for this hotel, aside from the fact that it's out of the action, is the newer high-rise next door, which casts a big morning shadow on the beach.Rooms. We go for the oceanfront deluxe, because of the view (see photos).. The room is pleasant, spacious and clean. The person saying he had an oceanfront deluxe is mistaken: the palm trees only block the lower oceanfront standard rooms. The restaurants are fine. Nothing spectacular, but it's al fresco on the beach, which makes every meal memorable and -- something you won't get in the center of Waikiki -- intimate. The locals like to hang out here, especially around cocktail hour, and the atmosphere is unhurried, cordial and casual. The service is a bit slow, but if this is a problem then you have no business on tropical islands.If you've come to Hawaii to shop, party and do the tourist stuff, this is not the place. But if you want Oahu without feeling you're in Miami Beach, this is the place.Note: We got a good deal on the room through the hotel Website, but now it looks like you have to book by phone.","Long Beach, California","jack_us_dk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Beach, California</strong>",40,5.0

I was very pleasantly surprised. The check in was smooth and the staff very polite and helpful. The hotel is very clean and although the room was small, we did have an ocean view. When I say small, I mean not much bigger than a cruise ship room and vey little storage. Since we were going to be at that hotel such a short time I wasnt going to complain, my husband however was not pleased. It really was a tight fit.The bed from the mattresses all the way to the pillows was a statement in comfort. I did not mind being in a hotel bed one minute I was there and I have never said that about a bed other than my own in my life. Believe me what the room lacks in space is made up for just by a good nights sleep.The room had a little fidge, but no coffee maker. I always travel with a small one of my own so I wasnt put out by it. It was nice drinking coffee on the balcony reading the paper that was included with our room pkg. every morning. Boy, those surfers sure get up early to ride the waves! The Otani also has a beach front location and a very nice beach. I've heard some say they snorkeled with good results, we however had no luck and we only did it once, so who knows.The hotel has a couple of different resturants, We ate breakfast there one morning and it was good, but a little pricey, I thought. There is also a snack bar that has beach access that was pretty good also, offering sandwiched, hot dogs, chile, soup, muffins and drinks. I also used the laundry mat on site, which did the job quite well. There is also a small convinience store which is great for snacks or souveniers on site as well. I think it""s open til 10PM or so.This hotel is close to the towns activity yet set apart by a park so it never feels crowded around the hotel area. Very relaxing to walk to breakfast through the park and watch the ocean! Lu Lu's is just up the street and offers great food at a reasonable price.All in all this is a great place to stay and I would stay there again with no problem. It's clean and very accommidating. It's not a 5 star, but your not paying 5 star rates either. If ya can't handle this hotel, you probably should'nt travel much because there's a lot worse out there!","Liberty, Missouri","zfordgal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Liberty, Missouri</strong>",39,4.0

Our view from the 3rd floor was of a lot of palm trees, the park and if you leaned out, of the ocean. Ask and wait if needed for a 5th floor or higher room. It's not worth the price on the third floor. Still it's better than staying at most hotels in Waikiki. The walking distance to a the beach can't be beat and being across the street from a spacious park is also a plus. The room for the price came with very few amenities, a very small refrigerator, an old hair dryer, and that's about it. I would also recommend that you look into staying at the Iikai Hotel on the opposite side of Waikiki.

We were absolutely impressed and delighted by the staff and hotel from the moment we arrived. We had booked four nights in an Ocean View room and were upgraded (for free!) to an Ocean Front Deluxe room. The views were amazing from this room. From one side of the balcony, we overlooked the quiet, serene, and lovely Sans Souci Beach, with Waikiki to our right. From the other side of the balcony, we had a breath-taking view of Diamond Head.The room was very large, with a refrigerator, television, love seat, hair dyer, bath robes, and Neutrogena toiletries. They provided a nightly turn-down service with fresh flowers sprinkled on the pillows every night. The room was perfect for us, though it could have used some sprucing up with some fresh paint here and there. The location was ideal. It was very quiet, and at night, all you could hear were the waves from below, yet Waikiki was a quick five minute walk down the street. There's a convenience store attached to the hotel where one can buy liquor, souvenirs, and a selection of groceries. We ate at the Hau Tree Lanai and Miyako restaurants at the hotel. Both were wonderful. We especially enjoyed having breakfast at the Hau Tree Lanai every morning as we looked out over the beach. The poi pancakes were delicious!Our wedding ceremony on the ""Imperial Lanai"" was lovely.

The room was adequate for the amount of time we spent in it - i.e we didn't arrive till about 1am & booked out about 10am so really only needed somewhere to sleep. The room was a bit on the small side so don't think you would want to stay in a standard room for any longer than a day or two.However the location was great. It was out of town at Diamond Head but right on the beach. This allowed us to go for a walk by the sea and adjoining park when we woke late & then sit in the restaurant which was right on the beach for breakfast & enjoy the view. After another short walk it was time to pack up, check out & head back to the airport for our flight on to Las Veagas.We would certainly do this again.

I knew not to take the NimitzHighway exit to get there, as it is on the far east end of Kapiolani Park, and is a bit hard to find. The staff was very friendly. My daughter and I were upgraded to a clean, small room with twin beds, with a fabulous view of both San Souci beach, and Kapiolani Park and Waikiki in the distance. We ate breakfast every day outdoors at the nice restaurant on site. Waikiki is a fifteen minute walk away, or the bus ($2.00) stops right down the street at the aquarium. Parking (valet) was a cinch, and the lot is so small it doesn't take more than a few minutes to get your car. The park got noisy on the weekendnights, but it wasn't unpleasant. The small beach gets crowded duringthe day, but is quiet at night.

The room was spacious and the view was awesome. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The beach was beautiful and great for swimming. The best thing about this hotel is it's location. It is separated from the hustle and bustle of downtown Waikiki by a beautiful park and strip of beach. Yet all the happenings of Waikiki are well within walking distance to any able bodied person. We walked through the park during all hours of day and night and we never felt concerned about our safety. The views of the park and Diamond Head across the street from the Hotel are great.

So we are happy to report that were very pleased with the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel. We stayed for 9 nights in a Moderate room and we had a terrific view of Diamond Head to the left and the ocean to the right between the hotel and the neighboring property. The room was clean and had everything we needed (refrigerator, balcony, toiletries, plush towels, clean bedding, ironing board, etc.) The only suggestion or improvement would have been an exhaust fan in the bathroom to help with the steam after a shower and the rolling louvered door lacked privacy. The bedroom furnishings and layout are typical to a standard hotel and are neither exceptional or unacceptable - however the pillows are terrific and the bedding is very nice. The staff was more than willing to assist with any question or request. We never had any negative experiences with the staff. I read complaints about dirty rooms - ours was perfect. I also read complaints about the sizes of the rooms. The rooms are not huge but completely adequate. If you are expecting the Hilton or another big luxury chain then stay in one. This is more of a boutique style hotel with a homey feel and clean friendly surroundings. Check out the price vs the big chains and see how you are paying for the big fancy room. But really what is more important... an extra 4 feet in the room or a comfortable room for the price in a hotel DIRECTLY on the beach in a quiet location? And really, who stays in the room in Hawaii unless to sleep anyway?The Hau Tree Lanai Restaurant was beautiful. I saw a review complaining about reservations for breakfast for a table with a view. Although the restaurant is busy and there may be a short wait we thought that this comment was interesting as all the tables had terrific views - the restaurant is beach front -inches from the sand - so really there are no bad tables we could see. The prices are high but hey eating on the beach in Hawaii is worth it - especially for breakfast. We didn't try the Japanese restaurant or the spa so we are unable to comment.The hotel is not brand new but most of Waikiki hotels are about the same age generally. The property is well maintained and inviting. We don't consider this hotel to be luxury but it is a far cry from a fleabag hotel in need of demolition. The New Otani Kaimana doesn't misrepresent itself and lives up to a feeling of home away from home. There is no pool if you wanted one - but swimming, surfing, snorkeling right in front makes up for it. Lastly the gift shop is more of a convenience mart - last minute small gifts, postcards, magazines, snacks and drinks but nothing fancy. The proximity to Waikiki is fantastic (10 minute walk along the park or along the waterfront). The benefit of this is that you don't have the city sounds at night and also don't have the city congestion but you do enjoy city convenience. There is an apartment building next door to the hotel but it is well styled and not an eyesore. One thing we will conceed is that the walk at night does make you a little nervous. It's very quiet and dark but we quickly learned that families enjoy cookouts in the park even late into the night so it wasn't a surprise to see young children running around laughing around 10pm. However, if you are nervous at night, the walk from Waikiki beach to the New Otani may be a little much for you (short but dark).If we have the chance to go back, we wouldn't consider staying anywhere else & would recommend this hotel to anyone we know.",Connecticut,"wbm97</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Connecticut</strong>",14,4.0

There was only about two feet of space when you walked into the room. There was no room to put suitcases. We cleared off the space above the TV for my husbands and put mine on the floor under the TV. I don't think I'd ever stayed in a room so small.The A/C either makes the room too hot or too cold. We were constantly making adjustments (even in the middle of the night). The air also seemed to blow directly down. We couldn't find a way to adjust it.We found the bar prices to be a bit high. We had a Mai Tai at Duke's for $7, and they were $9 at the hotel bar, and it was made with lesser quality ingredients (in my opinion). The restaurant prices seemed high, so we never ate there, so I can't give a review on that.The beach was almost a private beach for the hotel. It was quiet and peaceful. (Compared to Waikiki) The hotel lent us mats and towels to use. This was very nice.The bellman is also the valet, towel lender, direction-giver, luggage checker, etc. They need another person to assist with this job. We had to wait frequently, because we couldn't find the bellman, because he was outside somewhere or giving directions.Also, we had a later flight, so we asked if we could leave the bags while we walked around a bit, since checkout was at noon. They said it was fine. They had a room to put them in. We waited for the bellman, and he gave us a tag for our luggage. When we returned, we found our luggage still stacked in the lobby next to the desk. We were able to just take our luggage and walk out. No one ever questioned if it was our luggage or verified we had the tag for it. Not very secure.The walk to Waikiki was about 15 minutes. Not bad, but if I had to do it again, I would stay closer to the main beach for activities and a larger room and walk down to the beach by this hotel. Also, the buses no longer run on the road by the hotel, so you need to walk over to the zoo to catch the bus (not a bad walk 5-10 minutes), but not as convenient as described in another review).",Ohio,"TheresaD8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ohio</strong>",43,2.0

We spent the second week in Honalulu at the ""The New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel.""Let me tell you, I am a pretty patient person that understands mistakes.

We had a very positive experience and would stay there again without hesitation:-The room was clean, comfortable the separate bedroom was useful for putting our son down to bed early in relative quiet. -Parents keep in mind, however, that this particular room's restroom is directly accessed from the bedroom, so one cannot use the restroom until after your youngster has gone to sleep and will not wake up with the creaking of the opening door.-180-degree wrap-around patio balcony provided a truly stunning view of Diamond Head that will not soon be forgotten.-Situated at San Souci Beach, outdoor excursions with young kids is wonderfully hassle-free. The natural reef about 50 yards from the shore makes this an ideal place for small kids to have fun with the water.-The Hau Tree Restaurant was a bit pricey for lunch and dinner on our budget, but breakfast was excellent and reasonable every day, service was great, and dining under the large Hau Tree was unforgettable looking out on the beach.-Being a very short walk away from the Aquarium and Kapiolani Park was very convenient. We didn't use it, but the handy local bus system had a stop in front of the hotel.-If you stay here, go to the hotel website and look both at the different rooms and the different on-line specials. We saved much money with the ""free car"" package not only because the rental fee was waived, but the package also gives you free valet parking at the hotel - saving us another $50.The Downsides of the hotel are limited but worth mentioning:-The hotel seems to be at that precarious place of not yet, but soon, requiring renovation. The room was spacious, but the interior was getting quite dated.-Plumbing was a little bit problematic.-Rooms facing Diamond Head get a day-long blast of Hawaiian sun and our room's air conditioning system, supplemented by having to keep the floor-to-ceiling window blinds closed during the day, still didn't keep the room cool.-Although the convenience to the beach, aquarium and park were a blessing, Waikiki itself is a very long walk or an expensive parking proposition if you don't plan to/aren't able to use the bus.-For those of us who found the restaurants to be outside of budget except for breakfast, the distance of other restaurants, etc. was somewhat inconvenient, particularly with a toddler.All in all, we'd very happily stay again with our youngster because no where else will one find a comparably nice, quiet, and convenient hotel for parents of small kids right on the beach with stunning views of either the ocean or in our case, Diamond Head.","Hillsboro, Oregon","wereid</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hillsboro, Oregon</strong>",31,4.0

First, the staff was outstanding! Second, the Hau Tree Lanai Restaurnant was not only an ultimate romantic place to dine, the cuisine and service were top notch. I've read several reviews mentioning how expensive it is. Well, if you consider Red Lobster or the Olive Garden fine dining, then yes, it's expensive. If you are accustomed to true fine dining, the Hau Tree is of an average price range. Expect to have a bill around $125.00 for two. The Miyako Japanese Restaurant was a traditional Japanese experience, complete with wait staff in kimono's and excellent food. The view from this restaurant was also breathtaking. Third, the rooms. Make sure to use the room guide on their website to choose your room. We stayed in the 'ocean front' room on the seventh floor (take the time to look at the room guide on the website). This room was spacious and the view (which was nearly 180 degrees from the lanai) was, to say the least, spectacular. If you want a coffee maker, just ask! We also had a king bed as per requested. I did take a moment to look at other rooms in the hotel and yes, some rooms were tiny, but if it's within your budget, go for the gold. Worth mentioning, there is a small convenience store which came in handy and a 'deli' which was not up to the standards of the hotel. Fourth, San Souci beach and Kapiolani Park (directly behind and to the side of the hotel) felt like a private getaway. The beach was never crowded and you can snorkel or swim to your hearts content. Don't expect big waves in this area. The surf was quite calm, yet relaxing. If you are looking to be away from the zoo of the Waikiki area (it's a 15 minute walk to Waikiki...I timed it) and desire a complete package of relaxation, incredible views, romantic dining, excellent service and a great room if chosen wisely, The New Otani Kaimana will indulge your every wish.","Sun City West, Arizona","Billy_Shears</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sun City West, Arizona</strong>",42,5.0

We had a beach located right in front of the hotel which wasn't nearly as packed with people as the beach in town. This was perfect to start your day or end your day with. We were close to the park and walking into town was a breeze. Downtown Waikiki is so busy it reminded me of Vegas with all the foot traffic, so it was nice to be located a greater distance than everyone else. If you are staying there and are purchasing tours that will pick you up, just an FYI, you need to go out on the sidewalk and wait in front of the hotel, because of the limited parking, the buses cannot get in/out of their lot. We did a couple of shows that required pick-up/drop-off and a guest told us where we needed to be, so we aren't left behind.

The hotel is near Diamond Head (east of Waikiki, near the Aquarium) and is only a 20-minute walk from the center of Waikiki, but feels a world away from Waikiki. There is a small but very nice beach just next to the hotel. For travellers who like to run, this is the place to stay--good running (although on roads) around the neighboring residential areas, Diamond Head, and the park next door. The hotel itself is a decent 3-star place: lobby and rooms are on the plain side and could use re-decorating, but are clean and pleasant enough for those on a moderate to moderate-expensive budget ($100-200). Don't expect too much of the rooms, though--they are quite small and furnished with furniture that looks like it dates back to the 1970's. (See photos). But rooms are clean, if not immaculate. This is typical of Honolulu hotels at all price ranges--they are overpriced for what you get. You are paying for the location. If you can afford it, pay for a room with a beach or partial beach view. (See photo).Only major problem with rooms is that air-conditioning units, which were manually controlled, were noisy and too powerful--room became too cold--and could not be fine-tuned. So room was either too cold or too warm (but breeze from outside helped during mornings and evenings).The main restaurant with the lanai dining room is beautiful--overlooks the beach and is shaded by a large banyan tree--so be sure to have at least a drink there. But food is very mediocre.All in all, highly recommended for those who want a quiet tropical experience, not malls and big luxury hotels.",China,"China_watcher</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>China</strong>",8,4.0

The hotel is in a quiet part of town but only about a 10-15 minute walk to Waikiki beach. Although the beach in front of the hotel is nice, we really felt the beaches on the Windward coast are the most beautiful. The staff was very attentive, and service at the restaurant was very good too. The Hau Tree Restaurant in the hotel is right on the beach.

Upon check-in, we were told that our ""moderate"" room was not available (we booked a package on Orbitz & were not expecting anything special for the $$$) so the clerk checked us in to the Diamond Head wing. We had a partial view of the ocean & Waikiki from our terrace & had a good sized room with a kitchenette. We were on the third level so that did mean climbing stairs (wing has no elevator) but that was OK with us. The room is a bit dated... bathroom, furnishings, the general overall look of the wing looked like it could use a little upgrade from the ""queer eye guys"" but it was clean, the A/C was strong, & we could hear the surf on to the beach with our terrace door open! We used room service a couple of times after venturing around the island & thought it to be a decent deal. Especially, a seafood-sashimi/smoked fish appetizer called the ""tsunami"" which for $16 could have fed two couples. We rented a car & used valet through our stay so budget an extra $15/day for that.

It was clean, quiet and what a view. If you want to get away from the busy loud Waikiki, this is the Hotel. No waiting for the elevator, only twice in seven days we had someone else in the elevator with us. We had the Ocean Front Delux Room. I would highly recommend this room as it has a huge lanai, ocean view and if you walk around the lanai you get the cool winds and view of Diamond Head. Good size room.Take a look at the The New Otani Kaimana Beach website to give you a better idea about the Hotel.Since May 2006 the Hotel is a NO Smoking Hotel. After having always stayed in Waikiki, this was wonderful, quiet and refreshing. At night in Waikiki all we heard were people party and cars, busses all night long. It was always noisy in Waikiki. What made us decide on this Hotel is that our daughter last year said that Waikiki was too noisy, she kept closing the sliding door. Our daughter loved this Hotel all the way. The room was big enough so that she had space to play and run around and for us to do things too. It was not one of those tiny rooms. The kois at the entrance were another plus. It was also great having a removable showerhead so we could rinse our daughters sand off.The only bad thing was that the Beach in front of the Hotel was more of a swimmers beach and the more shallow area had too much broken glass. We like the shallow water of the Ponds right next to Waikiki Beach . So we had to drive to Waikiki for our daughter to swim almost every day, that was not soo much fun. Here are the good things:1. Quiet, no party no noises of cars. Only ocean waves all night long.2. Clean Hotel, good service.3. No waiting for elevator.4. Free or very cheap parking along park. 5. Kapiolani Park right across the street.6. Ocean front Hotel.7. Good swimming Beach right in front of Hotel.8. Bathtub with removable showerhead. 9. Hotel has only 7 or 8 floors.10. No smoking Hotel.Here are the not so good things:1. Have to drive to Waikiki for any interesting things.2. Front desk and Vallet almost never said hello.3. Had to keep curtains on side windows closed cause people on lanai could see in a little.4. Every night at 11pm they clean the beach and it's a little loud.5. Fridge was very tiny, could be a little bigger. This is a mini mini fridge.6. Beach in front of Hotel not the best beach for little kids. We never eat at the Restaurants there. And we never vallet parked. We discovered a good convenient store right by the Hotel. For everything else you have to commute.We would highly recommend this Hotel.

The open, airy lobby extends right through to the back where you can see the beach and the restaurant. The beach here is much less crowded than the ones on the main strip. The standard rooms are pretty small but this was not a problem for us. Plus who spends all there time in there room when you are in Hawaii. Our room was super clean and we were greeted with a complimentary pineapple in the fridge which we did not eat sorry to say we both don't like pineapple too much . We had spotless, heavy, white sheets on a thick mattress with two wonderful pillows. When we woke up, we opened our terrace door and all you could hear was the wind, the rustling of the trees and water -- very quiet. We were provided a morning local newspaper every morning which was great to find out what was going on locally. The one thing we did find peculiar is the louvered bathroom door, which leaves little privacy as you can hear through the door. Towels were thick and clean, bathroom products are all by Neutrogena.

Nice beach, right across the street from the park. I found the hotel employees cordial and accomodating, but, granted...not much for conversation. I was in a ""Diamond Head view"" room (I was not offered an upgrade, but then again I didn't ask), and it wasn't exactly inexpensive (~$175 with tax) but about what the beach front hotels seemed to command in Honolulu. I enjoyed my breakfast at the Hau Tree Lanai restaurant there in the hotel; again it wasn't cheap, but the view and surroundings were nice, and the food was excellent. The whole hotel had a laid back ambience, which I liked.Negatives: The room was small (plenty for myself or let's say a couple...not for family) and for someone who was tall or large (I'm not), it might not be comfortable. There was this funky showerhead, that was removable for handheld use, and because of its design, if you were taller than, say 5', you had to hold it by hand to really shower. That was weird.However, overall I liked the place, and would probably stay there again, maybe opting for a less expensive room without a view, since I spent so little time in the room itself. This may not be the place for someone wanting to ""party-down"" in Waikiki, or for large families, but it was what I expected and looked for on my visit.

We really enjoyed staying at this hotel. It is a smaller hotel that has great service, a great location (for us), and a beautiful beach. My husband and I are in our mid-30s without kids. We wanted to visit Waikiki, but we also wanted to try and minimize the amount of screaming children we saw as well. The location, the size, and the price of this hotel were the main reasons we chose it. The hotel is past the zoo, and away from the mounds of people staying around the main Waikiki area. It is around a 15 minute walk from the hotel down to where Duke’s is located. It was nice waking up every morning and taking the 10 minute walk down to Starbucks. Got the blood flowing and got to see all the people getting ready to start their day (surfers heading to the beach, people playing tennis, other people just getting outside for a nice morning walk).From what we could tell, most of the hotels centrally located in Waikiki were so close to one another, and they didn’t seem to have much of a beach area to relax on. The Sans Souci Beach the hotel sits on is huge, beautiful, and not crowded! The open air hotel lobby, bar and restaurant were nice and had wonderful views of the beach and ocean.

Maybe the key to this hotel is to pay a little more and get the nicer rooms? We were on the 3rd floor and had amazing views of the beach, ocean, the rest of Waikiki, and Diamond Head. The room was clean, and the maid service did a great job each day keeping it clean and giving us fresh linens. The price for this view and the room was super compared to the prices at some of the other more popular hotels.My husband and I could not stop talking about how great our little hotel find was. It didn’t have amazing furniture, but the bed was comfy enough. It didn’t have a huge bathtub & bathroom, but the shower and the sink were clean and worked just fine. It wasn’t in the middle of all the Waikiki action, but it was quiet and peaceful. It didn’t have a huge price tag, but it had the most amazing view from the huge lanai. If you want to visit Waikiki - but don’t want to break the bank and still have an ocean front view - check out this hotel.","Atlanta, Georgia","demi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",92,4.0

I had booked a Garden View w/kitchenette for fourteen nights. Upon driving up to the hotel I became concerned at the onset when I gazed at the Valet Parking desk. It was badly in need of immediate replacement. Entering the lobby I gazed at the ceiling and was attracted by the many water stained tiles. The Room Clerk (Male) that checked me in was extremely surley and most sarcastic. My other dealings at the front desk during my stay with other personell were uneventful and for the most part pleasent.The room, though clean looked very much in need of a complete replacement, from furniture to the wallpaper to the flooring. The room looked as though it was never touched once since the hotel opened. I guess you could call it tacky. Since we only slept there, it was okay. The A/C was positioned almost over the bed, high on the wall. It was noisey and could never be controlled properly to keep the cold breeze from hitting you in the face. The bed was not all that comfortable and the mattress should have been replaced long ago. The rooms are small and takes a bit of getting used to. The Television set is placed at an angle to the bed which makes it most agrivating to watch unless one is sitting on the bed facing the set. The chambermaids were wonderful and very accommodating. Their efforts in keeping the room clean left nothing to be desired.Most of the hotel personel that we came in contact with were very pleasent and tried their best to be friendly and helpful. We did not eat any meals in the hotel except for a daily breakfast that was included with the price of the room. Breakfast at the New Otani, is not to be missed. The food was well prepared and served by excellent waiters.Of course the location of the hotel in Kapiolani Park is it's biggest attribute. It's far enough away from the noise and tumult of Waikiki which is only a fifteen minute walk away.In summing up it was very obvious to me and some of the people I confered with that the hotel is in dire need of a renovation. Would I stay here again? Yes, if management makes the necessary changes that in my opinion are needed, The New Otani would then be a three or four star hotel. Right now the best I can give it would be a one and a half or two stars at the very most.","Georgetown, Texas","Sightseer7381</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Georgetown, Texas</strong>",30,2.0

I did enjoy being kind of far away from all the noise of Waikiki, but still within easy walking distance. I recommend taking something heavy with you to the room at night (ie. a two liter of soda, nice and heavy so you can club any attackers over the head). It is some amount of comfort, however that it is one of the safest cities in the union. The rooms of the hotel are very small, but they cram everything you need right in there, even a flat screen television. The staff was very friendly, they even supply umbrellas for rainy days. I found the water pressure to be fine comparred to other travellers reviews. My only complaint is the fact that our room was plagued by tiny insects that we never got around to complaining about, I'm sure they would've taken care of it promptly though.

Small, quiet, right on the beach (not across the street from the beach or one block from the beach) and with an above average restaurant and attentive staff. I highly recommend it.The New Otani is located outside the busy main drag of Waikiki, separated from the last strip hotels (like Aston Waikiki) by acres of park land where the zoo, aquarium, and old natitorium are located. The street swings out from the ocean in that area, giving the beach a little more depth than along some more public areas of Waikiki. The beach is protected by some reef making it very swimmable and providing some snorkling interest out from the shore. The walk along the ocean front to the main Waikiki area is about 10 minutes and very pleasant, but when you go back home, it is quiet enough to hear the waves.There is an open air lobby with a bar, a very nice restaurant right on the beach, and a Japanese restaurant one level up. The rooms and exterior are dated in decor (though public areas have been spruced up) but comfortable and clean. Bathrooms are small. Some rooms are small, but I had a deluxe ocean front room that opened right to the ocean on one wall and straight up to the lights of Waikiki on another. The wrap around balcony was spacious. I highly recommend the rooms ending in 17 (317, 417, etc.) for the best views.

I kind of enjoyed not being in heart of town. Surrounded by parks, zoo and aquarium. I enjoyed my long daily walks to get meals. It is strange to be in a beach front hotel with no access to the beach. You have to walk out the front of the hotel and around the side to get to the beach. Staff was very nice. My main complaints are that the rooms are crazy small and the doors have a commercial closing mechanism that causes the doors to slam hard every time you enter or leave your room. If you are asleep and someone down the hall leaves, you WILL be woken up. Also not to fond of the nickel and dime charges. $11 a day for internet access (talk about sticking it to you), $12 a day for parking (valet only), $2 a day to use the in room safe (free at most hotels because 98% of all in room theft is committed by hotel staff. Seems strange to charge me to protect me against their own staff). I guess this is kind of normal for this area.

They drag tourists' surf boards right over your towel, give lessons in the water next to your head, and shout like mad. They also hang around the park area outside the shop and either glare at people or goof off loudly. One almost hit me pulling out of the parking area.

The beach here is absolutely beautiful and never crowded (yes, you have to walk around the hotel, but BIG deal) and the locals will always welcome you to events in the nearby park. Yes, my room was ""small"" by most standards, but it was definitely more than adequate and was light & airy. And the view was fantastic. Would I stay here again? In a heartbeat!","Southlake, Texas","Sunshine32365</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southlake, Texas</strong>",7,5.0

It is affordable, offers sweeping views from the room lanais, a great beachfront location away from the noise and frenzy of Waikiki, and is home to Hau Tree Lanai, one of the best restaurants in Honolulu. Now for the downside: unfortunately, management refuses to offer non-smoking rooms, stating it is impossible to block such rooms due to the large groups of Jananese tourists who stay here (Otani is a Japanese owned hotel chain). Be forewarned that the tiny rooms will smell heavily of smoke, and that their practice of ""airing"" out rooms for non-smokers, is simply to open the windows prior to a guest checking in. While this serves to initially mask the odor of smoke, it does not eradicate the smell. Also, as previously stated, the rooms are miniscule in dimension, barely suitable for a single occupant, and then only for a brief stay of one or two nights, tops--and this was a ""suite"", so I am left wondering how inadequate the regular rooms must be. I was able to tolerate the room for only one of the seven nights I had booked. I was able to move next door to the Hotel W, to a much larger non-smoking room, with the same beautiful Diamond Head view, and it actually cost less money.","Lake Oswego, Oregon","LoveTravel17342</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lake Oswego, Oregon</strong>",24,2.0

We were doing two islands. Oahu was the first and the The New Otani was the first of our stay.I had booked this whole 10 day vacation with a travel agent.When we arrived to check in, the staff was very friendly. They sent us to our room on the third floor. We had paid for a ocean view. Well, when the bellmen opened the door for us, I about died!!! The room was soooooooo small that there was NO room for our suitcases. Being two gals, we had ""large"" suitcases!!! We had requested two double beds, but this room only had two twin beds. Yes.....the view was of the beach and ocean, but that was about the ONLY thing good about this room. We decided to go back down to the front desk and see if they could give us something bigger. The guy was soooo nice about our request. He said he could give us one up on the 6th floor, BUT they didn't have ANY double beds in this hotel at all. All they have there are twin beds or king beds. Being how this was someone I grew up with, we had no problem with the thought of sharing a king bed! So we said we would pay the extra to get higher up and a larger roomNow, this new room was much better. It too had a beautiful view of the beach and ocean plus the park that is on the one side of the hotel. It just so happened that the whole time we were there it rained so we didn't really get to see all that much. The room service was fast and good, but a bit on the high priced side.The hotel is way at the end of all the busy day/night life which was nice cuz there wasn't a lot of noise, but if you don't have a car and use a taxi it will cost you a lot!!! We found this out when we went to the Flea Market on Wed. and took a Taxi. It cost us $40.00! Lesson learned real fast was to catch a bus which came right in front of the park.If I were to go back to Oahu I might stay here again ""IF"" I didn't want to do anything but hang out at the beach. And of course, I would request when booking, for a larger room!!!","Placerville, CA","Storyteller25456</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Placerville, CA</strong>",10,2.0

Was pleased upon my early arrival to see that my room was ready (be aware there are no non-smoking rooms; they offered to air out the room before I got there, which seemed to have worked as there was no smell of smoke). The beach area in front of the hotel is very nice, extremely quiet compared to those in Waikiki. However, I was surprised to find how far removed the hotel was from Waikiki; I was traveling alone and would have liked to have been closer to the shopping, restaurants, and busier beaches, especially at night. In order to get to Waikiki beach, it's about a 15-minute walk across Kapiolani Park; this was fine during the day (although if you're carrying all of your beach gear and anxious to hit the beach, it can seem like a lot longer), but at night, it didn't feel very safe walking back to the hotel, especially since I was female and alone, as there are several areas along the walk that are not well-lit (I waited about 1/2 hour for the bus one evening, as there is only one bus line that will take you down that way - and many of the shuttles and tours will charge you $2 extra compared to the Waikiki hotels because of the additional distance; cabs are expensive). Also, the best waves to surf and boogie board are in Waikiki, not at the Otani (and it's much less expensive to rent a surfboard/take lessons in Waikiki than at Otani as well!), however the snorkeling was excellent right in front of the hotel. My room was very small, as the bed took up the majority of the area, but since it was only myself, it wasn't a problem. My package was for a standard room, so I was pleasantly surprised when I looked out the small balcony to see both Diamond Head and the ocean on opposite sides (not the greatest view, but a view nonetheless). The bathroom was small, and the water pressure was terrible, but it was cleaned very quickly after I left each morning. The beachside restaurant was extremely overpriced, but luckily my package came with breakfast coupons that allowed me to pick from the menu - very good breakfasts without exception - try the coconut macadamia nut french toast. The location of the restaurant was perfect, as every morning I got a table facing the ocean (~30 feet away); it was very peaceful and a great way to start the day. There is a small sandwich shop in the hotel which was handy for lunch, but unless I wanted to eat dinner at the 2 overpriced hotel restaurants, it was another hike back into Waikiki. I was a bit surprised by the lack of knowledge of the hotel's ""travel desk"" clerks - one who was on duty when I tried to get a rental car booked said she ""wasn't really familiar with the area of the hotel"" and later directed me back to the receptionist when I inquired about how to get to Diamond Head park. Also, be aware that there are no cash machines in the area - a trip into Waikiki is necessary, so make sure you leave yourself enough cash for the shuttle/cab back to the airport on your last day. All in all, it was an average hotel stay; the staff was polite, but not overly friendly with the exception of the bellhops who were always smiling. If you want an active Hawaii experience, with a beach party atmosphere (surfing, people-watching, music, and alcohol) with many easily accessible shopping and eating options - don't stay here - choose a hotel right in Waikiki; it's worth the extra $ to avoid the hassles of being so far away. If you want a very quiet, relaxing, secluded environment, then the Otani is for you. PS - I highly recommend Tiki's Bar & Grill at the Aston Waikiki for a great meal on the patio facing the beach; as well, if you have the chance, climb Diamond Head and rent a car to drive to the North Shore for the really big waves.","Fort Wayne, IN","Experience31985</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Wayne, IN</strong>",8,3.0

First of all, the hotel is separated from the crowds of Waikiki by a park, and while there is a cluster of hotels and condos nearby, it feels relaxed and quiet. When we wanted a livelier beach or a ""happening"" beachside bar, we strolled up the beach a ways. Also, the new W is basically across the parking lot, and there's a lively hipster scene in the 2nd floor bar.Our corner room was fantastic with a wrap-around balcony and view of waikiki and the sunsets. These rooms are slightly more expensive but worth it. Nice to see an empty in-room refrigerator--no tempting minibar.We had specially reserved a tatami mat room at the Kaiseki restaurant, and despite double checking before arrival, the tatami room wasn't available. However, the restaurant seated us at a regular table and gave us our meal for free! Of course we spent more on sake, but the meal was fantastic and we were very impressed.However, the main beach-front restaurant managed to fumble our breakfast--incredibly slow service, served us the wrong items, and way overpriced. Avoid it. The hotel seems ill-at-ease with its beachfront location; beach access is through a one-way back door down a hallway, and to return you have to go all the way back around to the front door. Not too inconvenient, but this is not a hotel that seems to embrace a casual, bare-sandy-feet kind of attitude. Which, really, is kind of nice--no bratty kids running around.Overall, a slightly expensive but very pleasant small hotel, away from the crowds but close enough to feel a part of Waikiki.",San Francisco,"SFGuyDoinStuff</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco</strong>",48,4.0
