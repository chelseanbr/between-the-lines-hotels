This was a great room for Tokyo with quite a bit of space. This hotel has rooms for every budget and the cheaper rooms are of course smaller and very much in line with your average Tokyo hotel room. I really enjoyed this location as there were many great places to eat within a comfortable walking distance and while there are love hotels near this location it is a very safe place and I was never uncomfortable walking the streets of Tokyo. All the staff spoke English well and I had no communication issues.

Amazing views, we were on the 16th floor and wouldn't have had it any other way. The room, while small, was accommodating for two. The bathroom was definitely the a really nice feature in the room, definitely used the tub almost every night of our 7 night stay. Price is affordable for Tokyo, but for someone coming from America, it's a considerable shock having to pay per person. We added the daily breakfast buffet, which I looked forward to every morning. A lot of the reviewers on here complain about the selection, but I was more than happy with the Asian options of curry, mackerel, and kimchi (great way to start the day, smelly breath and all!) Unfortunately, by our 5th day, the impending threat of the coronavirus turned the buffet into a standard 3-course, western breakfast, which I was less than interested in (why travel to another country to eat what you're accustomed to??)The hotel is in a very convenient location that may seem far on the map from other spots in Shinjuku, but you won't even notice it with how densely packed everything is and all the lights and sounds. Safety was never a concern for us, besides from some very aggressive taxi drivers who seem as if they're on a mission to hit you. In the mornings, you can see groups of young, drunk kids walking around, but that's about it. Overall, our trip to Tokyo was greatly benefitted from our stay here and we'll consider it again when we return.",,teemo321,9,4.0

We splashed out on a spacious Deluxe Design Double room on the 13th floor with great city views, handy to the club lounge, breakfast restaurant and bar. The room was stylishly designed with a comfortable king bed and good TV. The only down sides were the bathroom: the shower flooded the floor; there were no hooks to hang the towels; and the handheld shower was in a non-adjustable holder. There was also a lack of space for our suitcases. The western breakfast options were also a bit limited if you were staying a few days.

The rooftop bar has a great pizza and even greater view with heaters and blankets provided if it’s chilly. The front desk staff are very knowledgeable and provide free umbrellas to guests if it rains. We paid 1,700 yen each for the breakfast when we were in a crunch for time and it’s pretty pricey (unless you pick breakfast included) however did not disappoint - a good variety of western , chinese and japanese food to pick from. Only con is that we did get a room that was not the one we selected in the photo, considered a downgrade with the smaller size and more basic decor but had a great view. An FYI for more high maintenance travellers: there is only a few hangers for clothing storage in the room we were given and a small counter in the bathroom for toiletries. A reviving positive: there were full bottles of shampoo/conditioner and body wash and the toilet is heated :) Thanks Granbell!

It is right in the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku bar and dining precinct, making dinner and a few drink out at night super easy.In saying this, there are no noisy restaurants or club next door to the hotel so you can head back there at night time and enjoy absolute peace.It’s about a 10 minute walk to the Shinjuku train station, which open up access to the entirety of Tokyo. The hotel rooms themselves are quite small, just big enough for a queen bed and bench storage plus a bathroom. This is standard for Tokyo so you won’t find many larger rooms for a reasonable price. The room was tidy and liveable. Staff were friendly and helpful at all times, and the included breakfast was always good.

In doing a ton of research, this hotel ticked all the boxes in terms of the modern vibe we were looking for and the price point. Yes, true to all the other reviews, the room is small. However, if you get creative with space (I put one suitcase under the desk and used it as a shelf for clothing and we placed another suitcase on the rack), it wasn't bad! I liked the location, the shower was strong, the bed was comfortable and they provided pajamas! It has a full length mirror. The heater worked well, we had a nice view.

Though the location of the hotel is very central and easily accessible, the hotel itself was disappointing. We paid a lot for a “suite” that was barely suite level, and felt deceived by the misleading pictures online (clearly a common problem based on other reviews). The bathroom sink was huge, which resulted in not much counter space for toiletries or for a woman to do her makeup. There was not much closet space for 2 guests, either. But what bothered me the most was that the staff did absolutely nothing to make us feel special or extra welcome for being there for the start of our honeymoon. My husband had noted that our stay would be for exactly that reason, which also coincided with New Year’s Eve and our first time in Japan overall. No chocolates or champagne in the room, no welcome drink at any point, not even an acknowledgement upon checking in.

However, the reception told us to pay extra 5,500 yen if my friend wanted to ""enter the room."" This is extremely unreasonable and confusing. As I have checked in the room, why I would have to pay extra for a short visit from my friend?While I was trying to discuss the situation with the staff at the front desk, the staffs were extremely impolite with a discriminating tone. Sakura Miyata (the manager at the front desk) was very rude and even shouted ""Just pay!"" in our face.

While the room was lovely and clean the breakfast and executive lounge fell very short of what I'd expect in a 4 star hotel.The breakfast lacked choices and the quality was poor. I've attached pictures, but there was no fresh fruit, only the tinned type in liquid. The bread for toast was the most basic sliced bread. The fruit juices came straight from cartons, I saw the cartons being emptied into the jugs on two mornings. The scrambled egg didn't look appetizing as it was radioactive yellow in colour. There were 3 types of pastries on offer, again considering the quality of bakery offerings we saw in Tokyo these were basic. As a vegetarian who wanted a western breakfast my choices were extremely limited. On our first morning I asked the gentleman in charge if there was any possibility I could get 2 fried eggs and his response was an abrupt no, he was the rudest person we encountered in Tokyo during our whole stay. He didn't even enquire why I was asking, allergy aware he definitely wasn't! You had to self serve your drinks when 4 star hotels always serve you. There was no black tea or English breakfast tea. The hotel was busy while we were there and the breakfast spread clearly couldn't cope, people were stepping round each other and in general it felt like a slight step up from school canteen or food hall. Definitely not a relaxing pleasant start to the day. In 6 days we skipped breakfast 3 times it was that bad! A tip if you're looking for a good western breakfast go to Bakery and Restaurant Sawamura round the corner from the expressway bus terminal at Shinjuku station.The executive lounge lacked choices, the beer and wine offered between 5-7pm was Chardonnay or Malbec with 1 or 2 choices of beer. The nibbles were 3 types of savoury snacks from little jars on the side or dried fruit with tea and coffe or soft drinks. In most hotels if you're staying on the executive floor you can opt to have breakfast in the executive lounge but that's not possible here. One evening there were a few people in the lounge but staff weren't present so I had to go to the bar across the hallway to ask for the beer to be replenished. Overall the executive lounge felt very sub standard with the food and drink offerings, although the views are lovely. Given it's on the same floor as the bar why isn't the choice better? We needed to print our boarding passes (wasn't clear if our airline would accept mobile ones) we asked somebody in the executive lounge but no we had to go to reception downstairs. Last picture shows executive lounge offering.The mature designer double room we had, (room 1603) was spacious, clean and very nice, reasonably comfortable beds, shower worked well but wifi was dropping out/was slow at points, in the executive lounge the wifi was good.Location of the hotel was good, yes it's a 15min walk to Shinjuku station but we liked that and we found the area immediately around the hotel (kabukicho and Golden Gai) great for evenings out.Overall I can't recommend this hotel as there are better options around Shinjuku. If we come back to Tokyo I'd definitely stay around Shinjuku but in another hotel. Also to put my breakfast moan(!) above inti context we're currently staying in a 4 star hotel on a Philippines island and the breakfast and wifi is far superior!","London, United Kingdom","LFLovesTravel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",71,3.0

We always felt full and didn’t need to eat again until mid afternoon.I would recommend this hotel for anyone staying to Tokyo for the first time.

Our preference is via the Higashi Shinjuku station as it is the easiest and the fastest amongst the three routes. As you arrive by the subway train, head for gate A1. Fortunately, there are escalators going up from the underground to the upper levels of the station and therefore, it is a welcoming help, especially when you are tired, having travelled over a long period of time, tugging your luggages. As you exit the Higashi Shinjuku station, turn left and walked for about 30-35 metres. Turn left at the first road and the tall white building at a distance of about 120-130 metres on your right is the Granbell Hotel. You can enter/exit the hotel through the side sliding door. However, you will need your room access card to open this door at night. If you need to enter through the main door, it is just round the corner of the building.The reception is manned by 3-4 personnel and they are capable of conversing in English, therefore, it should not be a problem to bombard them with any of your questions or asking for directions. They are very friendly, genuinely polite and most helpful.The rooms are of standard sizes as you can find in any Japanese hotels but the one we had, had a compact bathroom with a bathtub and a modern WC that features heated seats with electronic gadgets for buttock washings, etc. It is equipped with the necessary toiletries, bedroom slippers, bathrobes, hairdryer, coffee making facilities, a safe deposit box and even a pair of pyjamas. There is a small work table with a table lamp next to the semi double bed. A 20in LED TV hangs on the wall fronting the bed. Two bottles of mineral water (500ml each) are supplied FOC daily.Breakfast is served between 7am to 10.30am at the 12th floor restaurant and there is a fairly good selection of food served, ranging from simple Western to Japanese/Chinese dishes, fruits (pineapple cutlets & grapefruits), fruit juices, fresh milk, soya milk, cereals, bread, porridge, salads, teas and coffee. There is a ‘Return Point” shelf where one needs to bring back used plates and cutleries for the kitchen staffs to wash later.The rooms and the surrounding access areas within the hotel are clean. They even have a few air purifiers placed along the corridors leading to the rooms. Another plus factor is that there are many restaurants and convenience shops located within short walking distance from the hotel which one may find it useful. This is a fine hotel, strategically located near to the subway train stations, served by friendly, helpful personnels and not overly expensive to stay. It is a highly recommended place to stay if you intend to visit Shinjuku, Tokyo.","Penang Island, Malaysia","Essserena</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Penang Island, Malaysia</strong>",12,5.0

If being really close to a station is important, you should find another. We could not find really good close restaurant and coffee shop.

I thoroughly researched this hotel and Shinjuku and not once did I read an honest review about the specifics of the location of the hotel. There are prostitutes on street corners throughout the evenings with signs around the neck detailing their prices, there is rubbish and garbage everywhere and the most horrible smells (we bought masks for when walking back to the hotel) and the Japanese Mafia own a number of restaurants within 10 meters. Further - we saw a drunk man in a suit fighting with a woman and man in the early hours of the morning (evidence of their escapades from their night before).

Plenty of room, a huge window overlooking the city, a roomy bathroom with a great shower and a separate bathtub. The staff were helpful and attentive and when I mentioned that the shower was only ""warm"" and not as hot as I like it, they sent someone up and had it fixed before my next shower.Working in the hospitality industry myself, I realise that you will never please everyone with breakfast, but I think there could be improvements made. While the Asian offerings of miso soup and kimchi, etc. were excellent, the Western offerings were not great. The scrambled eggs were so runny you had to eat them with a spoon and the bacon so raw you could barely call it ham. As I mentioned above, the room was great, but there does need to be something additional for hanging clothes, or jackets, etc as there was only a tiny rack next to the entrance that could fit 2 winter coats and that was it.

It was a great place to recover from long days exploring Tokyo. The smoking area at the front of the hotel was a lovely place to sit and listen to the sounds of Tokyo's Jungle Crows and passing crowds. A very nice roof top bar/restaurant had commanding views toward Shinjuku. The staff were lovely too. The only downer was late at night running the gauntlet of many African high pressure hawkers trying to entice one into shady bars in Kabukicho (The police broadcast loudspeaker messages about hawkers BUT do nothing about them...why?). My solution? Don't even acknowledge their existence and walk on by. One extra dryer in the self service laundry would be nice too. Would I stay again?

I will say the on-site amenities have the most bizarre hours. The cafe doesn’t open til 10am (Atleast during the week) which if I’m getting up at 10am coffee isn’t needed any longer. The restaurant seemed to select its own days to be open and lucky us— none of them were the days we were there. I also wished the bar was open prior to 5pm but I digress. The front desk staff was nice and had excellent English, which I appreciated. They even checked us in 3 hours early! I will also say when the maids were cleaning there was a very thick stench of body odor, as well as cleaning supplies strewn about the hall. I can deal with body odor pretty well but this was enough to make me gag a bit. Truly hope they’re compensating all their staff well! All in all a solid place to stay within walking distance of Robot Restaurant and Shinjuku station. ","Mesa, Arizona","F4522BJaprils</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mesa, Arizona</strong>",0,3.0

On the upside, the room is kept immaculately clean and we always get a fresh supply of towels, pajamas, toiletries, and water. The wifi is good and accessible everywhere in the hotel. The downside, I feel, is the breakfast spread which is by no means impressive. I thought it was rather basic and you'd find better options outside. And you will because the location is super convenient - there's a ton of restaurants and cafes in the area and walking distance to the Shinjuku train station. Speaking of location, one would actually say that it's kind of a red light area as there are short-time hotels (love motels) nearby and some night clubs, too. But despite that, you don't really feel unsafe. Not at all. We went up the rooftop bar which gives you an awesome view of the urban landscape below, but sadly, we find the cocktail drinks not up to par. The hotel staff is friendly and accommodating and there is a brochure/magazine stand at the lobby where you can get maps, leaflets, and magazines to help you navigate the city, especially if visiting for the first time.

Rooms are small but expected. Bed was a bit of a squeeze but bearable; you can only get on bed from one side and the pitcher side is backed / lined up against a wall. So, the person sleeping on the inside might need to be “flexible” in climbing up to bed ! Bathroom is small but ok; liked the strong water pressure and the instant hot water! Loved the heated WC seat and its electrically controlled bidet function! Space in the room was small and if you organize your bags properly, should be good for 2 cabin sized luggages. Anything more or bigger, you might have a problem unless you don’t mind opening and closing your luggages and store them upright each time you use them. Hotel was quite near to a metro station (Higashi-Shinjuku); about 5-10 minutes walk and serviced by the Fukutoshin & Odeo lines which take you directly to Shinjuku main station & Shibuya. Hotel is very near to many nice restaurants all within walking distance and also in close proximity to a red light district & bars/clubs! Front desk staff are generally polite and helpful and can converse in English; except for a male staff on the day of our checkout who wasn’t very helpful. Not sure if it was because he didn’t understand English but when I asked him if I should call for a Grab taxi or an Uber to get to the train station (as it was raining then), he quickly raised both his hands in a surrender gesture and said he can’t help and said that it’s between me and the driver, like as though he didn’t want to take any responsibility if anything goes wrong!

A good western breakfast offering is hard to come by in Tokyo hotels as an included option (its all about the runny half cooked eggs, fatty ham disguised as bacon, and some toast). 4.

There was nowhere to unpack my case - I usually like to unpack as soon as I arrive, but instead I had to have the cases on the follow which took up a lot of the space. If there had been 2 people in the room it would have felt claustrophobic.There was no desk or chair in the room - so if you are on a work trip it is hard to actually do any work. The Exec lounge didn't have wifi so if you want to sit and work you have to do that in the lobby and then you end up smelling of the cooked food from the bar.

The room is big enough for couple, so if you got a little kid travelling with you, I suggest you order a bigger room. You got the usual stuffs of course; some tea, coffee, water boiler, safe box and an empty fridge. Yes, they do not have a mini bar, but I’m totally fine with it. You also got two bottles of water each day, if you feel that’s not enough, you can always ask for some more at the cart or you can get one from the vending machine room downstairs. Their amenities can be considered pretty good. You got 2 set of toothbrush, shaver completed with the cream, you also got hair comb, body towels (to rub your back while taking shower), cotton buds, facial cottons and a hair tie! They did not give you a shower cap though. Another thing that I like is that they packed the shampoo, conditioner and body soap in a big bottle instead of tiny ones like most hotels do.I can’t say much about their breakfast/restaurants/bars because we didn’t go for it but staffs here can speak good English and that alone is already a plus. This hotel is also pretty friendly for those in wheelchairs and there’s braille on the elevator too. Another thing that I would like to give note of is the location of the hotel; which is very strategic place in my opinion. While the address does say it is located at the Kabukicho, it is actually not inside of the Kabukicho main district but rather a bit out, so there is no need to worry about noise or crowds, etc. It’s very close to the Higashi-Shinjuku Station (Oedo/Fukutoshin line) that can take you to Shibuya, Harajuku, Ueno, Asakusa etc. However, if you own a JR Pass it is best that you go to the Shinjuku Sanchome Station which is around 15 mins walk from the hotel.

This hotel is a 4 star on some sites and only a 3 on trip advisor. I’ve been in considerably better 2 star hotels!Location is possibly the only good thing about this hotel. Our room was small but I expect that in Japan and we were in the economy double. Compact true but that meant, other than four hangers in a small cupboard by the door, we could not unpack for our four night stay. But it was clean and we slept well. Also tea and nice coffee in room too. We bought some fresh milk and orange juice from local store and kept in fridge in room.All staff spoke English but I found the staff to be a little abrupt and unhelpful. At check in they gave no extra info like all other hotels I have stayed in usually do regarding breakfast, concierge, info etc. I literally signed a form and they handed us our key cards and walked away to do something else. Didn’t even point out where the lifts were. We later found some info leaflets tucked behind one of the pillars in the foyer. Looks like info in a library all tucked into plastic folders. Not overly welcoming. I tried to ask about using a taxi to take us to Shinjuku station as we’d booked the Narita Express train back to airport. Weather looked wet so we thought a taxi might be easier than the 15 minute walk. But I queued for over 5 minutes at what I thought was a concierge desk only to be told to go queue with all the hundreds of people checking in! I only wanted to ask a quick question. We walked to station in the end as couldn’t be bothered to find out information from anyone else. The foyer feels oppressive and dark. There were always cases all over the place and because it is quite a thin, long space when it was busy at check out or check in times, we were weaving through people to get to the door. I believe this hotel likes to call itself a stylish hotel but this, in my opinion, is lacking. Even though we were not told any info about adding breakfast to our stay we did check out the restaurant on floor 12 our first morning. It was not too expensive (1500 Yen each) so we just paid each morning to eat there. Good selection of food and hot drinks. Nice view from the restaurant too. But they obviously lack cupboards and storage in this place as the restaurant had piles of tables clothes and things propped up along the window sills as you walk into the restaurant. Don’t expect that from a four star hotel as made it look untidy.I would not stay here again and would not recommend to friends or family. Our next trip to Tokyo I think I’ll go back to a well known hotel chain. ","Aylesbury, United Kingdom","eph9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aylesbury, United Kingdom</strong>",86,2.0

The views from rooms is awesome!! Unfortunately that’s about it for the positives. We booked a ‘mature designer luxury room’ which was spacious but the only cool part of this room category was the bathroom - the living/bed area was quite ‘used’ and not really nice. I mean you pay around 300+€ a night and expect a bit more than a cool bathroom and a nice view. And here’s the worse thing about this hotel: the service. It’s actually like a hostel, they don’t give a XXXX about you as a guest. The ‘club lounge’ is terrible, there’s juices, and that’s about it. Between 3 and 5pm you get wine but have to ask for more every time the one wine bottle is empty, what happens quite fast as it’s rather busy during ‘happy hour’. View is nice though. Snacks are: chips and Japanese crisps - and that’s all they offer. And please don’t expect WiFi throughout the building - it’s limited to your room, not even at club levels.Breakfast is not even worth mentioning. Quality of food is TERRIBLE (!), you have to queue for a seat for at least 15-30mins - and then you get the lowest level of food. It’s really bad! View is nice - that’s about it again. Oh, and please don’t forget that you’ve to put your stuff away yourself, so there’s no one cleaning up for you, or anyone else. Reception and complaints: even though they run a hotel in the capitol the english level of staff is bad. We did ask for the ‘manager on duty’ after seeing the room and they sent the guy who runs the 13th floor lounge, who didn’t understand at all what we were complaining about. So he hardly said sorry and that’s about it. No apology, nothing happened. Safe box didn’t work, aircon is in Japanese only it was boiling hot in the room when we arrived, the mobile device you have in most hotels in Japan which is your personal guide in the city didn’t work at all. No love for detail, it’s a mass hotel - hostel as mentioned before would be more suitable. Result and recommendation: if you are interested in a nice hotel, focused on service and have a good time for your 350€ a night in a decent room category - DONT DO IT!! You’ll be as disappointed as you can be, same as we are now.

I had been looking at the Shinjuku Granbell for a while and figured if we didn’t book a standard room and went for the suites, it would be fine. Well it was honestly just average at best. First off, the hotel is on a small side street and does not have a drive up area for taxis or even a doorman. I thought this was a four star hotel but maybe I am mistaken. You have to get out of your cab on the side street and walk up this winding path to the front. When we arrived there were tons of suitcases in the lobby roped off - not sure if this was because of an event or something? There were a ton of people congregating in the lobby just sitting in the chairs and even sleeping at 2PM on a Wednesday. It just gave me a weird vibe. The hotel WiFi was out when we were there for the entire time. Not sure how the WiFi could be out the entire time but they provided a Handy phone in all the rooms that you were supposed to use. We had a pocket WiFi so this was not an issue. However, another disclaimer they write on their WiFi login is that it should only be used for email checking and web browsing not streaming videos. So take that into consideration if you are planning on staying here and using the WiFi. The hotel is HUGE and only has three elevators so it took forever to get up and down when coming or going. Guests would also cram into the elevators - most of the time the elevators would beep because there were too many people on them. Super frustrating when you are just trying to get up to your room.We booked a deluxe designer room casual and the room was okay - just a bit dated. The room was a good size as well as the bathroom. There were scuff marks all over the walls as well. The view was great - and the toiletries they provided were better than expected. The shower didn’t get as hot as I wanted it to but other than that no serious complaints. We did have a weird encounter with room service at 9am when they knocked on the door trying to clean the room. We didn’t have a sign out so probably our fault but it was still early. Another thing to note is there is NO GYM in this hotel. I would have thought that as such a huge hotel that has a variety of room types they would have some kind of fitness center, but nothing is here.We had breakfast included in the room rate and it was meh. We went down the first day late and were not super into it. Everything is on hot plates and it is just a standard buffet offering. I would skip it and eat something in the surrounding neighborhood. All in all, the stay was average at best, I feel like online it is a little misleading about the hotel experience. Still, it is a good price for what you get - I would just rather pay for a standard room at a nicer hotel than get a suite at the granbell.

The bath was a good size and we really appreciated the complimentary amenities in the room including different types of bath salts. The room had 2 large windows one by the bath one by the bed the view isn’t special. - The room lacked practicality if you are staying more than one night as it has one tiny cupboard that fitted one coat and one shirt in and that’s it! No chest of drawers to put your clothes away in etc, the hotel also advertises that you can do laundry but there is 2 washers and one dryer for the whole hotel so this wasn’t possible as it was in constant use- Throughout the week on occasion our fresh linen and towels provided after the room was serviced smelt questionable. The hotel is in the red light district and perhaps some of the clientele only visit to ‘rest’...- Breakfast definitely isn’t worth having at the hotel, I’d recommend finding somewhere in Shinjuku instead.

I am so happy that we chose this hotel! It really was a fantastic experience. I did not know what to expect given the reviews. However, i think that the hotel rooms may vary quite a bit in this hotel. We stayed in room 1605 which was a Luxury Designer Double Room (the one with the shower and flat screen TV in the middle of the room and a large tub in front of a floor to ceiling window overlooking the city - see pics on website). The website photos did not do this room justice. It was really so beautiful! The shower is spacious, with a handheld spray nozzle and rain shower head. There is a his/her trough sink, with a toilet in a separate enclosed area. The soaker tub was amazing. There are two sliding frosted glass doors on either side of the shower/TV block that can separate bath/bed if you want more privacy. The bed was great, pillows comfortable, and there was a decent size table with comfortable chairs at the other floor to ceiling window by the bedroom (with a lovely view of the city and the rooftop bar and patio down to the right on the 13th floor). The room was nicely stocked with anything you would want, robe, slippers, red wine, teas, disposable drip coffee (which I had never seen before), and all toiletries and supplies you might need. The lighting in this room is also incredible, with dimmers on many lights, and the pot lights nicely placed with warm light as opposed to a cool light. The staff were extremely friendly and service was great, both on the rooftop bar and when we called for anything we might need, such as extra coffee, wine, calling for a taxi, or help with our Handy that would not charge. The room comes with a ""Handy"" which is basically an android phone with google maps, internet etc. . It was a life saver when it came to navigating our way around Shinjuku and beyond, both by foot, and subway. Great perk!We loved the location of the hotel. It is situated facing a quiet street in Shinjuku, with a nice deck and seating area outside the front door and some greenery. You can buy coffee, beer, snack items and other drinks at the lobby bistro and take them outside. We did not do this but opted for the rooftop patio and bar a few times. Amazing views and great staff, the food up there, however, will not be the reason to go. The main restaurant is closed, and the rooftop patio has limited food choices. I had hoped for some grilled chicken, sushi, miso soup, some healthy yet what you might expect in Japan type of food. Nope. Deep fried breaded chicken tenders, french fries, pizza, french onion soup. However, there was a great prosciutto and parmesan green salad with sherry dressing (most healthy item on the menu, I think). They need to step up the food in order to bring it into line with the quality of the service and the rooms. However, overall the rooftop patio was a great experience and we did return every night, at least for a glass of wine and a snack. The internet was spotty as other reviews have mentioned so keep that in mind, and rely more on the supplied ""Handy"". We did use our cell phone data from home to surf the net for some information on attractions, etc. a few times. As far as the location being in the ""red light district"", this did not present any problems in terms of us feeling uncomfortable or uneasy. We walked many blocks through this area without incident on a couple of nights. We also went to two restaurants and the Robot Restaurant Show in this area. We are both in our 40's from a rural area in Ontario, Canada, so not like home, but nothing daunting. Five stars for this hotel.

Having said that, lots of cool bars and restaurants in the area, which was fun. Room wise... we had a deluxe Hollywood twin room. It was quite small, and the pillows were horribly uncomfortable. Wifi was pretty bad, but they did provide a ‘handy’ phone with internet access that we used a lot for google maps when out and about - really helpful and the main perk of the room for me. Vending machines all around the hotel, and a restaurant, bar and cafe. We didn’t eat in any of them so not sure how they are.Staff are approachable but service was a little haphazard. We requested extra pillows that didn’t arrive until we asked again the next day, and unfortunately had an issue with the hotel not accepting NAB bank cards. We had to pay on arrival but with none of our cards being accepted we had to pay in cash which was really inconvenient. This could have been handled much better than it was and left a bit of a sour taste for us.There is a small laundry at the hotel, but limited facilities if the hotel is busy so we had to go around the corner to do washing. In summary, clean and serviceable for a short stay, location was okay provided you’re not a family, small rooms and uncomfortable bed.

The hotel seems reasonably new, its certainly very clean and well maintained, the little origami figures on the reception desk (changed daily) were nice - liked the Pikachu, especially. I booked on line and had to extend by a day - this was no problem but they advised me to book on line again as it was cheaper than the front desk rate (it was!) which was nice. The room, supposedly a double, was quite small. Fine for one person but I would have struggled if my wife were with me. Partly I think this is a Japan thing, but also because space is at a premium in Shinjuku. I was amused by the high tech toilet (heated seat, adjustable sprays!) and liked the provision of a free mobile phone (no data but free calls including some international). The minibar was empty - actually a good thing. The surrounding area is infested with small 7/11 type shops so its cheaper and more convenient to buy your own.The TV channel selection is quite limited and only has CNN in English. AC was arctic-effective, handy in the humid Tokyo Summer. No Gym but I wouldnt have used it anyway after a day's touristing. The restaurant is no longer open, though there is a lobby cafe and a penthouse bar. Again there are many restaurants in the immediate area.A few words on Shinjuku - it is a hub for the metro and Japan Railways services, with several stations within 10 mins walk of each other. A bit of a tourist trap at times, with hostess bars and guys trying to lure you into strip clubs, but also food, shops and other attractions and plenty of native Japanese were also there.

One incredibly useful thing was the 'Handy' device that you can use for the duration of your stay which means you have a sat nav, internet, and phone without picking up roaming charges. This is a huge advantage and well worth considering for this alone. The bar on the top floor has great views of Shinjuku and normal expensive prices for a hotel bar but very enjoyable for a relaxing drink.

Staff are too busy to help with luggage or concerns outside of check-in/check-out. Pros: You’ll still be awake at 3am because you’re sleeping arrangement is so uncomfortable which means you’ll have time to give the hotel a very prompt review. Save your time and money. Stay at the Ibis. I’m currently staying at the Shinjuku Grandbell on night 1 of 4 and my experience has been pretty awful so far. This is not a 4 star hotel by any means - 3 stars is a stretch. My partner is allergic to feathers. This has never been a problem anywhere else in the world. Tonight, when I realised the (rock solid) pillows were feather I phoned to have them swapped. The hotel had to phone me back and say they didn’t have any so we made do with the throw cushions on the couch. They would see if they had other pillows in the morning. Every Japanese person we have met up until today has been incredibly kind and polite so even though I was wrapping throw cushions in clothing so I could sleep on them, I was very polite. I later realised the doona is also feather so phoned again and apologised for the second call and asked for a different blanket. The desk attendant told me to come get it myself because they were short staffed. So at 1.30am I opened my suitcase in the smallest room in the world, got dressed and went down to the front desk to find THREE attendants standing around with nothing to do. After noting how abhorrent the service was, the desk attendant blamed me for not requesting the bedding for a good 20 minutes while we argued about his terrible service (which I might add, wouldn’t have happened if he’d just nicely asked me to come get the blanket, rather than demanding me over the phone. I’m not even going to play the ‘paying guest’ card and say he had every capacity to bring the basic bedding to our room). I told the desk attendant I would have my travel agent phone to have a refund issued so I could leave this terrible hotel. He told me he didn’t care, fetched the tiny blanket and came back to yell at me some more. I think the blanket he gave me is a single so my partner and I are huddled in the middle of the rock solid bed because the blanket doesn’t fit across. It’s probably a good thing because the throw pillow is only the size of my head. If I were to roll over I’ll face plant onto a solid stone mattress. Two good lessons here: 1. Stay somewhere else; 2. Make sure you annoy the desk clerk AFTER you get your bedding supplies.",,amy w,2,1.0

While this hotel is new the lobby already looks old and there are disgruntled guests sleeping on the couches with their suitcases everywhere! The smoking room is located next to the lobby making it smell like smoke! We often had to wait in line in the smoke filled lobby for the elevator up to our room! The room itself also already feels old with scuff Marks all over the walls. Our room on the 10th floor was very dark with minimal light and was very stuffy!

It's absolutely fine. Yes Kabuki-cho is a bit of a ""red light"" district - in the mornings you might see a few people stumbling worse for wear from the night before, and at night there are touts on the corners spruiking strip clubs - but if you're not looking for that sort of action they'll largely leave you alone. The Granbell is located on a quiet street on the edge of that district anyway, so you can avoid it altogether if you really want to. It's a short 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station, which is a great hub for lots of JR lines, and there are lots of great and affordable restaurants and bars within walking distance.

This hotel warrants 2-stars at best and was a huge let down.The room was much smaller than what was advertised when we booked (through Booking.com), with absolutely nowhere to unpack a suitcase. There were so many funky looking rooms on the booking.com site but not one of them accurately depicted the bland and compact room that we had. There was just enough room for the bed and a couple of feet of space to manoeuver around it. However I cannot fault the hotel for this since I should have done my due diligence and read the TripAdvisor reviews prior to booking, and it is quite common for hotel rooms in Tokyo to be small. To the hotel's credit, the rooms were incredibly clean, the beds were comfortable, and there were plenty of toiletries provided in the bathroom.That being said, it takes more than just a clean hotel room and some free slippers to label yourself as a 4-star hotel. Booking.com describes the room and hotel as being ""Fitted with an air of urban sophistication."" What would be more appropriate is saying that this hotel tries to be sophisticated but fails spectacularly. From the moment you walk in the hotel, rows upon rows of luggage clutter the lobby (undoubtedly people travelling who have left their luggage in the lobby for the day). Dozens of disgruntled looking guests are hanging around on the couches and there were so many people that we had to line up to get into the elevators. The lobby was in this state every single time we went through it, whether it be at check-in time, in the evening, or at 1AM. It was impossible to appreciate any ""air of urban sophistication"" in this hotel because of it's inefficient layout resulting in unpleasant clutter and crowds in the common spaces at all hours of the day.Although the bathrooms in the hotel room were sleek, the room itself was not what I would describe as urban sophistication. There were bare white walls that were covered in scuffs and stains (which comes as no surprise given how small the rooms are), and furniture that looked a little on the worn out side. What's worse is that the sliding door to the bathroom was so flimsy and devoid of sound-proofing that you can literally hear everything that goes on in there (not recommended for romantic getaways if you get where I'm coming from).The service at the front desk was average at best. Despite there being many people working there, no one seemed particularly warm and friendly. I had a stressful experience trying to coordinate forwarding my luggage with one front desk employee who didn't seem to know what he was doing (although he was trying and he was friendlier than the other staff members). I did not have full confidence that my luggage was going to arrive at the right place at the right time but thankfully it did.We did not eat at any of the restaurants though we did order coffee and a matcha latte from the café in the lobby. The matcha latte was exorbitantly expensive and incredibly small... you can get much better for much cheaper in Tokyo. The coffee took about a half hour to arrive (no exaggeration). After about 10 minutes of waiting, we reminded the two barristas who seemed to have forgotten about the order (note that there were not more than 5 other customers in the café area at the time, so it was not a busy period). It took another 20 minutes before we got the coffee, because the two workers looked flustered/annoyed and seemed to be having a disagreement with one another. It was very underwhelming service in comparison with what we had grown accustomed to receiving elsewhere all over Japan.Lastly, while the hotel is located within a 3 minute walk to the Higashi Shinjuku subway station (Fukutoshin and Oedo lines), it is still about a 15 minute walk to the main Shinjuku JR station (which connects to well over 10 different lines including the JR Yamanote loop) so the location isn't as ideal as it could be. It is located in the Kabukicho district (aka love hotel district) however I did not find this to be sketchy in any way. The hotels advertised hourly rates on the outside but anything that was going on in or around the hotels was done in such a discrete way that it goes mostly unnoticed. The hotel rooms that were advertised actually looked pretty cool and we wondered if we would have gotten a better value staying in one of those instead of the Granbell.Overall, the cleanliness was appreciated but everything else about this hotel was a disappointment. For a lower price you can get a much larger Airbnb (for our first week in Tokyo, we stayed about 5 minutes from Shibuya Crossing in an Airbnb twice the size of our hotel room for significantly cheaper). In fact, if you're okay with small hotel rooms there are much better options for half the price in Shinjuku (i.e Ibis - small but efficiently laid out, chic, and 3 minutes away from Shinjuku JR station). Save your money and find a better place to stay. Avoid the Granbell if you can!!","Montreal, Canada","Natasha I</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",50,2.0

We found the staff very helpful and everything very clean. Not all of the staff are fluent in English, but enough of them are.Served on the 12th floor with a nice view of the city, the included breakfast was a nice bonus. It's promoted as ""western-style,"" but keep in mind that is a pretty loose descriptor. Don't expect all of your comfort foods or even those foods they include to be familiar. But you're in Tokyo! Be adventurous!And it turns out, miso soup for breakfast is actually really good.On the topic of breakfast, there's a small coffee shop on the ground floor; however, like all coffee shops in Tokyo, it seems, it doesn't open until 11. So if you're like me and need coffee in the morning, hit it up at breakfast (which you should make sure your booking includes) or make other plans.You will read other reviews about the small room size, and yes, our room was small, but it's Tokyo. Know what to expect. Focus on the positives, like the comfortable bed (which is 99% of the reason you get a hotel room) and the greatest toilet you'll probably ever sit on. Also, the smaller size means this hotel is affordable. A big plus, each room is supplied with a Handy phone, which is a smartphone you can take with you on your travels. The hotel should really do more to promote this because it's a huge bonus if you're traveling without an international data plan. I gather this isn't uncommon anymore, but it's nice that the Shinjuku Granbell has them.And be aware that this is in Tokyo's Red Light District, Kabukicho. In the immediate area, you'll find love hotels, clubs, and some potentially shady looking places for Shinjuku. But again, you're in Tokyo. That means you're still relatively safe, and you're not coming here to not experience the city and culture. And, this might actually be a plus for you. For instance, Golden Gai is a very short walk away. For that matter, Shinjuku station isn't far.Is this the best place to stay in Tokyo? No, but it's a solid choice that, if you temper your expectations, you probably won't regret.

This was by far my worst experience ever. I woke up after my first night at the hotel and was covered in bed bug bites. I asked to speak to the manager privately since any hotel- including four star hotels, can have bed bugs tracked in. The manager was contemptuous and rude. He simply offered to have the sheets changed which demonstrates a complete disregard for this issue. After significant pushback he agreed to change me into a new room- the same room type and category, and at my insistence, launder my clothes since the rooms are very small and my clothes were in close proximity to the bed (bed bugs lay eggs in clothing or hitchhike). The manager was super difficult to deal with, totally unapologetic, initially refusing to launder my clothes, although he ultimately relented. During my discussion with him he was more concerned about ensuring I did not receive a benefit as a result of my terrible experience, continuously saying to me “no benefit for you”. The hotel took my clothes to launder them. I was later informed that they would not be ready until the next day. When my clothes were ready I was not notified.

Before you visit Japan, Tokyo particularly, you are of course aware that space is a commodity in major demand but this room was fairly small even by those standards and two of us struggled managed to navigate the room, let alone with two suitcases. If you need a reference, did you or a friend ever get your first double bed as a child/teenager and despite you having a box room, you were going for the king-size. All your visitors and your poor mother simply had to stumble around the foot-wide moat surrounding your bed. Cute kimono pyjamas were a lovely touch and the vending machines on ground floor were a great punch of Tokyo. Staff were friendly and of course the anticipated/dreaded Japanese toilet was great. We always say this but location is so important, so fo us, next to two metro lines and the monumental Shinjuki station certainly made for a great base. Also being tucked a way a little from the high streets made leaving and returning comfortable. Only other negative would be that the panoramic lounge they boast about was closed. I think this was because it was ‘cold’ but even still, for all the fuss they made over it, would have been good to have visited it. Particularly as we were there around New Years.

The desk clerks were most helpful but not obsequious. There were lots of tourists from all over during our stay.The area felt very extremely safe.

So nearly every hotel around this one has posted rates for sections of hours, rather than full nights. A pretty fun cultural difference that can be entertaining.To get there, we took the limo bus from Narita and then a $20 cab from Shinjuku station to the hotel. On the way back, we took the train and after riding the subway system for a while and getting the hang of it, the train back was quite easy but it might have been a tad overwhelming first thing off the plane.

The only issue I have with the hotel is that there is no guidance or directions available for walking from Shinjuku Station (which is the route most would take), which makes it extremely difficult to navigate through bustling Shinjuku, especially of you don't have Wi-Fi. The hotel itself was sophisticated without being grand. The rooms are well kept and the staff are nice without being great. One issue with the room however is the TV. The channels are all understandably Japanese, however, the only English channel is an American news channel. Now that maybe okay for some, however it would be great if the likes of NHK English, Al Jazeera, the BBC and others alike would be included, and potentially a standard channel that plays English content (given that Japan has a large array of entertainments option available on TV). However, this hotel is a solid choice for those who want to be right in the heart of Tokyo and get a feel for Japan (especially the room sizes haha).

The bathroom amenities were great, as were the shower products available. An extra plus for clean and crisp PJ's in the room.The economy double room, that we had initially booked, had a bed that was too small for two persons. At least two persons of Scandinavian height. We upgraded the room to a superior room with a slightly bigger bed. The service was not what one would expect of a four star property in Tokyo, however. The staff were curt, and difficult to communicate with, partially due to the fact that they hardly spoke English. They were unable to help out with dinner reservations at restaurants or book taxis unless you were personally present in the lobby. This was a bit unpractical, as most restaurants open later in the day. On one of the days we stayed, we received an e-mail that due to electrical tests, we could not access our hotel room between 12:00 and 17:00. This was fine. On our last day, when we requested a later check-out of one hour, the front office required that we pay a fee for this. We thought this was a bit unflexible, seen as we had not been able to access the room for five hours the previous day. They would not budge on this, and were quite unfriendly about it.I would not recommend the hotel breakfast, which seems to have been outsourced.

There was no space to either side of the bed in our room and you literally have to climb in and out of bed from the bottom, not fun at 3am.Breakfast is vile, the food could not be more random or more disgusting, from fish to rice, to smelly hams, it was a struggle.The club lounge is 4 seats, a few jars of nuts and few soft drinks, don't have high hopes.Checked in, given keys, up 16 floors and they didn't work at the room door (the most annoying thing in the world) when i came back down to correct they laughed amongst themselves.The rooftop bar is nice, they charge 500 yen to be seated even though you are a guest in the hotel with is greedy and the bar is half empty, perhaps this is why.Would i stay here again... wouldn't be my first choice.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Tim O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</strong>",71,3.0

I ended up choosing the ""Luxury Designer Double with Kitchen/Mature"" and I'm quite glad I did.The Room: Very spacious and well thought-out with an excellent view of the city which can be enjoyed either at the breakfast nook or in the tub. It also comes with an electric stove which is pretty simple to figure out even if your Japanese isn't exemplary. The microwave and other appliances were also quite powerful despite Japan's wattage differences. The room was always kept clean and room service even washed any dishes you may have forgotten to take care of (there's some basic utensils, plates, and even a santoku knife stored and covered on the underside sink compartment).The Food: We ordered room service once and the food came almost as fast as I'd ordered it. This gave me some high expectations for the breakfast buffet that was an option I'd added on in the reservation. Unfortunately, the food was ice cold and the warming units really didn't do their job and therefore my wife and I both got sick. Nothing a few Seirogan pills couldn't fix, but it definitely stopped us from utilizing the rest of our meal vouchers.Enjoying good food elsewhere wasn't an issue since all the best restaurants and cafes are a 4~10 minute walk away.The Service: Rough start, but definitely got better at the end.My wife and I wanted to wash our clothes but were unsure how to use the washer, so we asked a woman at the front desk to make sure we didn't end up flooding the floor.I have native speaker level Japanese abilities as a 2nd Gen Japanese American, so conversing with the staff was not an issue at all. Anyway, I asked the woman how to utilize both the washer and dryer functions properly since there was no instruction manual at the room and the labeling was in vague English. She advised me that both washing and drying was done on the blue marked cycles and to simply add the Dryer timer function to the right to ensure everything worked well. By utilizing the red markers, I'd end up only using hot water to wash the garments. I thanked her for the information and retreated to my quarters where my wife and I spent 5 hrs (default timer setting). After the time had passed, we realized our clothes were completely damp. Fidgeting with the controls a bit, we kept to the woman's advice in blue cycle since she'd expressly warned me to not use the red. I decided to go back downstairs with a photo of the dial just to make sure that it wasn't a miscommunication error on my part. She then looked over my photo and assured me her information was correct. Going back, we spent a good bit of time again with only damp clothes to speak of. Not wanting to wait another 5 hours, I went down again to the front desk and requested her assistance. She went up to our room and began making adjustments. .....it was at this point we realized that she didn't know how to use this machine either. Eventually she found a set of instructions online and sent them to me in English via email & realized that the red markers are indeed for DRYING. This upset us quite a bit as we've now lost a whole night's worth of sleep over her misinformation that could've been solved had she simply said she didn't know how to work the item and can ask someone else. Even if we were to get our clothes to dry right now, practically a whole day would be wiped out just in our room. Looks like my plans to go early to Nikko flew right out the window. We asked to speak to a manager and were informed he would be in at 9am. The time stamp on the email the woman sent for when she found the instructions? 5:44am. The laundry we had was in the wash for so long we had suspicions that even on the max heat settings we'd be looking at the clothes still being moist at that time (and indeed we were regrettably correct). Nevertheless we made the attempt. About 15 minutes before 9, I called the front desk and a man answered. He already was informed of the situation and stated we could come down to the front desk once the manager had arrived. I asked if the manager could come to our room instead due to us being in either dirty clothing or robes, to which he cut me off stating it's not possible at all. Now, I'm the type that wouldn't mind wearing clothing a couple days used, but I definitely wouldn't want that of my wife on our honeymoon!Thankfully the manager did end up calling us and came up to the room within a matter of seconds.I explained to him the situation once more and he immediately sprung into action by taking all of our laundry needing attention and having it professionally cleaned at no cost to us. This was a nice jesture, but even he informed us that dry times may take just as many hours to complete. ...may as well have told my wife we were under house arrest. I demanded some form of compensation as due to his employee's ego we'd literally lost an entire night's worth of sleep & now were abandoning an entire day of our honeymoon. I wasn't demanding anything crazy like my whole stay refunded, but I definitely wasn't going to settle for a laundry service and a bar tab discount.He warned me loosely that getting a cash accommodation is far above his level and he'd need time to get that sorted out. I'm quite familiar with Japan's comp system and know very well that most Japanese give up out of frustration when stalled, so right after he'd taken his leave to deliver the laundry to the cleaners I'd already found the Granbell CEO's information. Thankfully the manager saved the day. He personally delivered each bag of clean laundry as it'd finished including some of my wife's highly delicate items. Any communication I had with the front desk in terms of requests or inquiries were transferred immediately to him. Amazing customer service, but again the issue of comps were up in the air. This didn't get resolved until the next morning.We ended up getting the night's stay refunded!!! Hallelujah he came through on his promise to do all he could. Couldn't have been happier. I then asked if he wanted me to remove this incident from my review as a courtesy since I didn't want my story to cause people to try demanding comps left and right from him (because I assure you this is NOT customary in Japan-- 9 out of 10 times you will get NOTHING, and that's everywhere). He told me to go ahead and write the review anyway as it can be a learning experience for the rest of his staff. It's hard to find managers dedicated to helping the customer in a fair way like this. I truly hope he will continue to remain in charge of the Shinjuku Granbell for a few more years as my friends and family are already gearing up to make reservations next year and thereafter.Final Note:This hotel is everything my wife and I could've asked for from start to finish. There was indeed a rough patch of misinformation regarding the washer, but the manager was able to fix the issue and take us seriously every step of the way. Room service cuisine was tasty, the room was absolutely breathtaking, and any craving from a shopping fix to local restaurants are accessed with a brisk walk.I highly recommend the Luxury Designer Double Kitchen/Mature (especially if you're concerned of other patrons' reviews regarding the general laundry room or space of the lofts) & look forward to returning there again soon. I rarely bring local souvenirs to hotel staff & management, but the Shinjuku Granbell can definitely hold me to that promise in the future!",,ardentlife,2,5.0

Pros:-Beautiful view from the room and breakfast table. The front desk offers a range of free guidance on local foods and attractions.- We stayed in one of the suite rooms so the Club lounge was included in our stay. It has a wonderful view and free snacks/happy hour. Great place to pit stop after a long day, the coffee is also great in the morning if the foyer cafe isnt open. We found the concierge desk was only stationed after 4pm however, so if you needed advice or to check-in, you had to go downstairs to the main reception. - Great facial products, our room had all shiseido mens and womens facial cleaning products and moisturisers. - The cafe in the foyer was the best coffee we had in Tokyo. Proper barista coffee. It doesnt open until 10am however, which was inconvenient if you wanted to grab one on the way out each morning. - Plentiful and free umbrella's! We unfortunately stayed during Typhoon Lan, which caused rain all week long during our stay. The hotel had an uncountable number of umbrella's for guests which were a blessing during the downpour. We found other accommodations across japan dont provide this as standard, so were happy in hindsight for this. - Vending machines in the foyer provide every food item you may need, hot drinks, cold drinks, savoury and sweet snacks at cheaper prices than 7 Eleven.Cons: - The long walk to the station becomes arduous with tired legs after roaming Tokyo all day or when you have luggage. Save yourself the hassle and get a taxi if arriving from the station, the ground is very uneven. Taxi is only 800Y. - Consider whether the hotel is the right location for you. It is not overly close to any restaurants (with the exception of an amazing ramen restaurant around the corner), so we found ourselves eating the local 7 Eleven delicacies many evenings as we were simply too exhausted to head back out to the main shinjuku area. We discovered on the final night that Uber Eats works terrifically however, so this may assist if we stay again. - Shinjuku station is a very very complex train station to navigate, simply figuring out which exit to take, or taking the wrong one can add 20mins to the journey, then you have the 15mins to walk back to the hotel. Higashi station is closer/more straightforward, but still a 10min walk away. - A little too much effort has gone into the visual design of the rooms but not the practical, strange tinted glass doors cutting off the bath from the room, but no blind on the giant bathroom window which meant light streamed in each morning. We asked if the front desk could put up a makeshift sheet etc, they said no. Not sure if this was lost in translation or simply too hard but it ruined our ability to sleep in/very well as the bright city lights at night are equally harsh. - No shower cap in the bathroom, we requested one but were told they couldn't provide it. For the price of this room you would think this a standard inclusion. 7Eleven also doesn't sell them. - Breakfast - one day would be okay of their offerings, but nothing is rotated so we found ourselves heading out after the second day for coffee and bakery foods instead. There are some western options - dried out tiny breads and croissants, scrambled eggs swimming in so much butter one mouthful is enough and some yoghurt. Sometimes pineapple. The rest is all traditional Japanese breakfast (eg: miso, pickles, fresh fish) which was also okay for one morning, but not everyday. - There are only 3 lifts for the whole hotel, which given its size was surprising, so the wait can be long.","Canberra, Australia","AmandaKK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",22,3.0

For the same price or marginally more, you can stay in a hotel with larger rooms, better service and somewhere that is just as convenient without having to walk through the ugly side of Shinjuku.

The room was small which we were expecting, however it really was tiny. We stayed in three other hotels around Japan, including in Tokyo, and this was by far the smallest room for the same price. It also seemed like if there was a way to charge you extra for something they did. For example, we arrived a few hours early and they had our room ready however, because it was before check in time we had to pay 1,000 yen for every hour that we were early. In my opinion this is not great service and every other hotel in Japan that we stayed in offered early check in at no cost.

I assume it must have been somewhere but it seemed like they were trying to hide it and it would have been nice to have been made aware.Overall, perhaps a fine hotel if you're looking for a place to crash amongst Shinjuku and want a nice reception area to walk through, but Japan has great service and this hotel just doesn't do it justice.

It's a bit of a walk from here to Shinjuku train station but again an Uber or a taxi isn't ridiculously expensive.

I know that a table charge is applied in many restaurants all over the country which is obviously no problem to me. You are having a meal and you receive a full service. We went to the hotel bar though during happy hour, to have a beer for 500 Yen and were charged an additional 500 Yen per person. We were told the charge was the same at the bar and at a table in the bar. I do think that this charge is a bit exaggerated when you are just going to have a drink.

The hotel is situated on a quiet street, so noise from traffic or passersby was not an issue.Our “Superior Hollywood Twin” room featured two comfortable single beds, a small fridge, as well as a small bench and lounge chair by the window. Although the room was thoughtfully designed – everything had a purpose and a place – it was quite compact. There was little room to navigate around the beds, and there was nowhere to put the suitcases or hang clothes, with the exception of a few hangers kept flush against the wall in the entry. We had initially booked this hotel for three nights at the beginning and three nights at the end of our two-week vacation. In the end, we found the tight space to be tiresome; we tried to upgrade to a larger room, but none was available.

Reading all the other reviews good and bad and watching tons of Youtube videos. I can honestly say this little gem is perfect for everything, location, pricing and cleanliness. Located on the eastern side of Shinjuku you will find yourself with in a 4 min walk to Golden Gai, (A must see and experience for yourself area) The rooms are normal size for Tokyo if you want larger pay more and don't complain because you are frugal. After stalking the prices for weeks we finally found a really good price that included breakfast, normally we don't do breakfast but it was worth the extra 11 bucks a day and the breakfast was enormous and far far better then any skimpy European breakfast we had during out travels. The rooms were very clean and we stayed in a economy double on the 16th floor with a great view. They have a rooftop bar on the 13th floor landing that looked out over the city, they have daily happy hours and a decent menu as well at the rooftop bar. The front desk staff is more then helpful and will direct you and give you maps to anyplace you want to go. If you are a shopper , most big stores are by Shinjuku station which is about a 10 min walk. The area is very safe and you have tons of choices of food with in a couple min walk. I tried to cover all the bases here because I read a couple reviews that just seemed ridiculous and I want everyone to be upfront because thats how we book our hotels. Let me explain, if you have 4 to 5 Large suitcases and book a small double room for 3 or more people you get what you purchased its 15 SQ meters plus bath room they have larger that only cost 20 to 30 bucks more. The food in the restaurants was superior to or equal to most of the 4 to 5 stars we have stayed in. The area is a have a good time area , that is why you are staying in Shinjuku !

We moved to this hotel after staying in a different suburb of Shinjuku for 3 nights prior. While the hotel was clean, we definitely were not satisfied with our stay. To start off, in my opinion this hotel is definitely not worthy of a 4-star rating. No idea why Trip Advisor thinks it is. It doesn't have the rooms, service or amenities I come to expect from 4-star hotels. We stayed in a 3.5 star Sheraton in Osaka previously on our trip, and it was nicer with bigger rooms, and had much better service than our stay at the Granbell. While the hotel is located in Shinjuku, I wouldn't say that this is a great location, just OK. You're 15 mins walk to Shinjuku station and the popular Yamanote line, among many other trains, so not terribly convenient if you're coming to do a lot of sightseeing, but it works if you don't mind 30 mins roundtrip from your main train station. There are other train stations close by but we didn't find them useful at all to get to top sightseeing spots in Tokyo. If you're coming to party, eat and hang out mostly in Shinjuku, then the hotel is in a better location. It's in a safe area and was quiet at night.We expected the rooms to be small, and they were, but compared to the other 3.5 and 4.5 star hotels on our trip, the Economy Double rooms were very, very tiny. It's tight for 2 people with luggage, you can make it work but it's not terribly comfortable. The bed is stiff but fine, the pillows sucked though to put it mildly. The bed is up against a wall, so you can only get off on one side or the end. There's no closet to store your things. Thankfully there is a small fridge to get some drinks and stuff.The best part about the hotel was the cleanliness. The rooms and hallways were very clean, so that was nice to see.The service really let me down. For a 4-star hotel, you expect high quality service. I emailed the hotel prior to check-in to ask some questions, and never got a response. When we arrived, zero chance of an early check-in, they already have a line for you setup when you arrive to drop your luggage for storage. Speaking of luggage storage, they will hold it for you, but it's just sitting in the lobby with everyone else's luggage, hardly secure. We asked for a 1 hour extension on our check-out time because our flight didn't leave until the evening. Again, zero service, they wanted to charge me $25 for 1 hour. I asked if they could make an exception, absolutely not. I asked if this was because they'd be promptly cleaning the rooms right the 12pm check-out time, and was told yes this was the case. 12pm came and went and no one was there to clean. It was a Tuesday, the hotel was not sold old, I have no idea what their problem was. So instead of letting people relax in their rooms for an extra 30-60 mins, everyone is just waiting in the lobby to head to the airport or their next destination.Regardless, the hotel did the trick if you're looking for a clean place to crash within walking distance to Shinjuku. Next time I'd probably look for something closer to a Yamanote line station elsewhere in Tokyo. You can still easily come to Shinjuku whenever you want. There's really no reason to stay here unless it's a last resort or you want to just stumble home to a clean hotel after a big night out. Make no mistake though, this is not a 4-star hotel.","Vancouver, Canada","r2edline</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",7,3.0

Pros are that it's a really central area of Tokyo. The rooms were clean & the bed was comfortable. The room was very small but most places you stay in Tokyo will be small. Cons = The restaurant is no good so if you are wanting breakfast or a meal I would suggest you go for a walk & eat elsewhere. The roof top bar was a really great spot to sit & enjoy a drink but it was rather expensive. Keep in mind that this is the red light district and often even middle of the day you will encounter extremely drunk people roaming the streets. We loved the fact that it was so close to Golden Gai and would head there most nights for a drink in one of the many small bars. Everywhere around here there are adults only hotels where you can rent rooms by the hour. Not ideal but I guess like I said before it is the red light district. If you're not precious then I would say stay here.

I booked through flight Centre and they were pushing this hotel. I chose this hotel based on price and location. Like all the reviews say you are surrounded by love hotels and the red light district. It's totally safe but if you're traveling with kids and coming home at night you pass all the clubs with pics of girls on the wall so just depends what you're comfortable with. We arrived at 7am on the first day and there were literally 3 different people rolling drunk in the gutter which was pretty confronting but they're no threat. Our first room was a superior double which is a standard room FYI. It was TINY I thought people might be exaggerating in their reviews but they're not. For 2 people with bags it just doesn't work. We paid extra and they moved us to a Hollywood twin which was much more manageable but far from Hollywood. The annoying thing was that by the time I'd paid the upgrade I could have just stayed in a nice hotel with a gym and pool. They obviously have an amazing photographer because it looks much nicer in the pics but it's modern, clean and fine. The wifi is bad and drops in and out. I got better wifi in pubs or tullys coffee. The rooftop bar is nice but doesn't open until 5pm like pretty much everywhere in tokyo we found! It's open late on weekdays though so a nice way to finish a day out. The breakfast is TERRIBLE, literally the worst I've ever had. We didn't eat it and went to McDonald's! We found bfast generally tricky and maccas and Tullys coffee our safe options nearby and on the way to the subway. It's a pretty solid walk from the main Shinjuku station especially in the heat, don't attempt it with suitcases like we did. Grab a cab from Shinjuku station when u first arrive. There is a smaller station only four mins walk if you change lines at Shinjuku but we weren't up for that on arrival. After a shower and dropping our bags we found the subway easy to work out. Recommend you grab a day pass on the subway then it's easy to get around. We switched between that and our JR pass throughout the day depending on where you were going. Overall the hotel was fine, they had vending machines, maps, air con and was clean but I'd look at something like the Hilton or a full service hotel next time for a bit more comfort and a pool.","Brisbane, Australia","Mags132</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",63,3.0

It was safe, but a dodgy area. As a single person I wouldn't stay here, however I was staying as a couple. - One thing that angered me was that they didn't allow early check in for free, even one hour early would cost you 1,600 yen PER HOUR. I was outraged at this, I call this just good customer service.Overall:This hotel is simply ok. I returned to Tokyo and didn't stay here as it's just average and is quite expensive (also a little too far from the station).

You have to look hard to find things wrong with this hotel. I spent 4 nights in this hotel over Memorial day weekend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I want to preface this review by stating that I've paid as much as $800/night for hotels in the past and I've stayed in pretty high end brands so I'm not exactly easy to please. Obviously I adjust my expectations based on the price. I paid about $220/night for my stay here. The Pros:1. The hotel staff is amazing. Really they are godsend. I had several great experiences and lots of support whenever I needed it. Miyaka at the front desk (hope I got the spelling right) was especially helpful calling a tour company to help me get in at the last minute. I didn't end up going on the tour but her going above and beyond was such a relief. At that stage I was early in my Tokyo trip and the first day is always tough for me in a new country until I get my ""sea legs"". So having a hotel that was willing to accommodate and support me was such a relief. More shocking to me is that Japan is not really a tipping country so these people go above and beyond without that expectation. For me (as an American) that makes it all the more impressive. 2. The hotel itself is beautiful. A nice coffee shop downstairs with light food options, outdoor seating, a lounge and dining area. It's very modern and clean and well kept. 3. The room: AMAZING. I thought I fell into a suite when I walked into this room. It's futuristic (as is common in Japan) so it took me some time to figure out how to turn on lights (and use the toilet!) but once you get the hang of it, it's great. I had am amazing view, a huge bed and sitting area, big TV (not that I ever watched it) and a huge bathroom with big clawfoot tub, walk-in shower and an ultra modern and comfortable toilet (with bidet). Also the amenity kits you get in the bathroom are among the BEST I've ever had in a hotel. 4. The breakfast: This was included. I've seen other reviewers criticize the quality of the food but really I don't know what the expectation would be. It's a breakfast buffet and it's included. This isnt the 4-seasons and I didn't expect steak and eggs. I thought the food was actually quite satisfying and well done. I enjoyed it each morning. Is it high end? No. Is it hot cooked food with interesting dishes, an extensive amount of choices (hot and cold), good coffee, and both American and Japanese options? Yes. 5. The biggest biggest PRO of this hotel to me is the location. I really hit the gold mine there. It's so close to so many things. Most importantly you are WALKING distance to Shinjuku station (the busiest train station on EARTH. Literally, I'm not just making hyperbole. It actually is.) So needless to say you can use this hotel as a base to explore Tokyo and many many areas around it. It's also in the heart of Shinjuku and there is endless endless things to see and do in Shinjuku. Not just the amazing neon lights and red light district and gay district and theaters and shopping and squares but also a huge central park Shinjuku-gyoen right up the road from the hotel. I didn't even realize all this was there until late in my trip. Just pick a direction and there is so much around you. Cons:1. Room closet space: The only big drawback to me was the amount of space to hang clothes. It's such a big room I really wish they'd give you a real armoir or closet so I don't have to squeeze my stuff into a small space to hang up clothes. I'd strongly reccomend adding an armor of some kind. If we had been two people there simply would not be any room to hang things up. 2. I really wish they'd install some USB ports. For such a modern room, I was very surprised about that oversight. It's minor but it would be nice.

Look at the m2 room size details provided though, three to five m2 is a big difference for a small hotel room to begin with. We also stayed in a Superior Hollywood twin for one night and the size difference was noticeable (Tip to hotel, do away with the hanging chairs! suspect they never get used and take up too much room. Also provide space under beds for cases) The beds were very comfy and the rooms otherwise well equipped (The heated, auto toilets are awesome!) Wi-fi bit hit and miss in our room at one of the extremities of the building, but it was ok elsewhere.The view from the rooftop cafe bar is fantastic and worth a stay on its own (tip to hotel: why play jazz in a funky Tokyo hotel? obviously it's inoffensive but in the largest and one of the coolest cities on the planet, surely there must be plenty of local alternatives?)

The location is great, a short walk to Shinjuku station (which is bafflingly huge) for JR, subway etc. and great views from the rooftop bar and bedroom room window. I'll attach a pic from our room. We had booked the smallest room available (15 sq metres I think) due to availability limitations for the dates we needed so expected it to be 'cosy', which it was. The facilities were great though, good bed, bathroom, kettle and fridge in room.Only criticisms really were that they could make better use of the space in such a small room to improve storage as there were a couple of panels that looked like small drawers or cupboards that didn't actually work, and the wardrobe area seemed to have a lot of wasted space above and below where you could fit a suitcase with better planning. Minor issues though and overall would recommended. Note if you've not stayed in Shinjuku before the streets after dark are something of a seedy culture shock but do feel very safe and certainly give you plenty of bright lights and culture for photo opportunities!

My expectations before getting there were not high ... I was moving across from their sister property in Shibuya (which also has great pics on the website. Unfortunately, that was the worst hotel I stayed in in Tokyo.On arriving at the Shinjuku location I knew immediately that we were playing a different game. A sleek clean modern and airy hotel with well kept staff behind the desk. Was this the same hotel chain?I went up to the room expecting to bump into the bed as soon as I opened the door and WOW - what view, what a room. The room (a deluxe double that I'd gotten a great insider price with Orbitz on) was huge. In fact the bathroom alone was the size of the previous room I'd stayed in in Shibuya. The windows were floor to ceiling with an expansive view of the Tokyo skyline, and there was a free standing bath as the centre piece in the bathroom (as well as a separate enclosed power shower), and even the telephone was Georg Jensen. The wall art was seriously upgraded from the cheap laminate photocopy in the sister property. This is what I'm talking about!The room amenities included a vanity kit (Jack Black (I think) for men, Shiseido for women), the cutest pinstripe yukata, slippers, complimentary bottled water and fabric freshener. Plus, as I was staying in a deluxe double, I had access to the club lounge on the 13th floor - which offers free beer and wine from 6.30 - 7.30 and complimentary snacks throughout the day. I enjoyed taking an hour each night to relax and take in the view over the glass of wine while planning my itinerary for the next day.The hotel is close to many many - too many things for me to take advantage of in the short time that I was there. I did go out for a run one morning and ran across two major parks on the tourist map (but couldn't go in as they actually don't open until 10am ... weird), and did have a very late night drinking in the Golden Gai area ... literally minutes away from the hotel. The buffet breakfast offers the best dining view that I had (along with the rooftop bar). They both offer a vast expansive view across the city. This hotel offers a Scarlet Johansenesque experience of Tokyo without the steep hotel tab! The breakfast buffet could get quite crowded, but there was never more than a few minutes wait to get a table (so don't stress if there is a huge line) and the options were plentiful (serving Western, Japanese and Chinese breakfasts). The only thing that needs a little more attention is the wardrobe space for a room of this size. There wasn't one. This may have been a problem if I was staying for more than 2 nights. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again. A great option if you're celebrating a special occasion with someone special. I did a Facebook live chat from the hotel room and everyone was commenting on how romantic the room was.","New York City, New York","JMO73</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",37,5.0

Even on the 5th floor I would've liked to see outside some more. I didn't order the breakfast, but tried it (for an additional cost) the first day. For a westerner it was totally NOT worth it. The asian section was probably OK, but the next mornings I got something fro 7-Eleven instead. To sum it up: the room was good an comfortable, but compared to the price I expected even better.","Vinstra, Norway","toferik</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vinstra, Norway</strong>",22,3.0

Off in one of the side streets, the hotel is surrounded by food outlets, bars and hotels with rooms by the hour.Some taxis have difficulty finding the hotel, but the hotel can give directions patiently. Expect to look after your luggage. There are no bell hops here. We wheeled our luggage into the main lobby and were greeted by a fairly professional reception team. With none of the warm Japanese hospitality, we went through the check-in process clinically. I was not impressed.The lobby is small and very busy. It gets the afternoon sun, so it can get quite hot. We were housed on the 12th floor in a triple share room with a loft. We were on the same floor as the Italian restaurant /breakfast venue, thus we had to swipe card access to the room area.Immediately apparent was a narrow corridor to a narrow room. The high ceilings take away the fairly narrow width. There are no cupboards for clothes and storage space is certainly lacking. Side tables don't have drawers or a cubby hole to throw stuff into. Everything is pretty compact and did I mention the lack of storage space to hide away our traveling junk?There's a tea making facility on the table below the flat screen TV. Only Japanese TV stations and CNN can be found. WiFi can be received from the room, but can be a little slow at peak hours. A fridge is hidden in the cupboard below; it works and there are no drinks/snacks provided. Next to the fridge is the room safe.Clothes are hung on a railing using hangers; there were 4 hangers for us. A round sink sits at the end of the corridor. There are generous amenities for the guest including shaving kits, tooth brushes, combs, cotton squares and cotton buds.The shower and toilet area is modern looking, while still retaining the Japanese fibre glass construction. A rain shower was a nice touch. A good sized bath tub is placed beside the shower. Organic bath products are provided. The toilet has the usual Japanese functionalities.The King bed for us was comfortable, neither hard nor soft. There are charging points on the bed side table. Charging points can also be found on the study table under the loft staircase. A leather bound mirror can be found on the shelf above the safe.The loft is a fairly small space. Our 13yo could fit in there comfortably, but a tall adult may be a little uncomfortable.We did not eat in the hotel. The surrounding area has a wide variety of food shops and convenience stores. The hotel about a 5min walk from Higashi-Shinjuku station. From here, make your way to Shinjuku station where a wide variety of trains can take you anywhere in central Tokyo.We liked the concept and design of the hotel room, though I felt it was small and had not very functional storage and work area. The service standards was a big put-off. There's a 50% chance we will return. ","Singapore, Singapore","Jamie575</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",203,3.0

I also liked that at this price point, they had separate bottles of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel, not an all-in-one dispenser like at some chains.(2) Walking distance to multiple subway stations, restaurants, bars and shopping (Isetan, Marui, etc.). Yet, street noise was not an issue.(3) Tomo at the front desk was helpful with reserving a seat on the airport bus for my departure.Issues(1) No gym(2) Free wi-fi sometimes didn't work well for video streaming. Maybe too many users? You'll need it as there was a limited number of channels available via the TV in the room.(3) Kabuki-cho is a red-light district and there are a number of ""love hotels"" adjacent.

I'd say the staff make this place, they were extremely polite and helpful.

With the air con on, it gets too cold. Turning it off, the hotel's central heating system gets too hot. Made it quite difficult to adjust to the temperature. Breakfast is good and they have both western and Japanese style breakfast. The mini croissant was especially nice. Make sure you get there early as it gets packed and you will have to wait for a table.The hotel is in a pretty good position. It's close to all the night life in Shinjuku so if you're in Tokyo for that, it's perfect. (Close to Robot Restaurant if you're here for that). Its position will throw you off at first though because it's surrounded by love hotels. Made us second guess whether we were in the right place.As for position to train lines, it is surrounded by a lot of stations but the closest one (Nishi-Shinjuku) doesn't usually take us to anywhere we want and most times, Google Maps will direct us to stations that's more than 10 mins walk away. This got a bit tiring when you've been walking around all day as it is. All in all, this is a pretty good hotel with a pretty good English-speaking staff.

The rooms are tiny which is to be expected in Japan, but the only space for any of your clothes, etc, it a bar when you first walk into the room with 4-5 hangers. No drawers or anything. But the small space is to be expected. Right now the hotel is under a LOT of renovations. We ended up on a floor where it looked like we were the only guests and all other rooms were under construction. Despite coming and going frequently, we had a worker walk into our room while my boyfriend was in the bath and I was about to change. No knock. Nothing. He just barged in. This was distressing on many levels. I told the front desk and requested to switch rooms. They moved us a few floors down. The room was just slightly bigger. The amount of construction happening on the floor was basically just as much. If we had had more time to devote to switching hotels, I would have. Additionally the breakfast served in the morning was terrible. Hardly any options and overall not well made.

Then in 1-2 weeks leading up manage to secure Executive Club rooms for the exact same price, so we called the original rooms and booked the much more spacious and refined rooms. The Executive rooms were spacious enough and I would have hated to be a the original room we booked. The Club lounge is very basic. Coffee throughout the day and then from 6-9pm beer and wine. We often had to ask the staff member for more drinks as it wasn't replenished very often. There is also only about 8-10 seats in total.

The area itself was lively with plenty to see and do, of course its in the red light area but never felt seedy or dangerous. Its a 10 - 15 minute walk to the station but if you are in Tokyo be prepared to walk anyway so no big deal, I would recommend this hotel for couples or group of friends not sure about calling this a family hotel even though we saw a few there only because of the area.","Trondheim, Norway","139carlat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Trondheim, Norway</strong>",7,4.0

Bathroom was a window overlooking my bed which I found a bit weird but interesting. The shower gel, shampoo and conditioner as guest amenities were very good quality and had a nice scent.The Japanese toilet which I couldn't wait to try and play with was such an experience!!My room had a view of the street and some skyscrapers which I really liked. I was visiting in the hottest period of the summer, and the air conditioning was working, although I had difficulties finding the correct setting (if I switched it on after half an hour i was freezing in the room, but when turned it off I'd wake up in the middle of the night sweaty and having to turn back on and off several times to maintain a comfortable temperature in the room).I've made my room reservation including breakfast. For the breakfast I had to show my stamps on my separate breakfast stamp card every morning - I had 11 stamps for my stay but since I was away for 3 nights I had 3 unused/additional stamps. I had a friend staying over with me and went with him for breakfast, the staff said it's not possible to redeem my extra - 'unused stamps' for my friend to have breakfast but they charged me 1300 yen. I found it unfair and unacceptable BECAUSE the card does NOT state in any form that the stamps would be valid only for my name OR only for specific date, whatsoever... So next day I went to see front office manager with my complaint and to make them aware I am not willing to pay for this so I want them to remove this room charge. After a good 20 mins 'argument' which included sharing my views as a 5 star hotel employee from London about why I don't feel this charge reasonable and that I know how it works so will not hesitate to take my complaint further if he can't manage to remove this charge from my account. Well, I have seen the first (and only) angry Japanese person during my trip but he did remove the charge which I asked for, and although his anger was visible and he didn't maintain his welcoming smile as a front office manager, I said thank you and wished him a great day afterwards.The breakfast otherwise was excellent for me, wide range of continental choices, eggs, beans, sausages, fresh bakery and tea/coffee/juices so I liked it a lot as a good start of the day. Also the restaurant had brilliant views over Shinjuku.The housekeeping staff was very polite, caring and hard working, whenever I bumped into them they greeted me with a smile on their face.The staff in general all spoke English but not fully fluent. I don't blame them for this, as it's a global issue, even at train stations I had trouble finding English speaking staff sometimes, I wonder why exactly its this bad in a capital city like Tokyo which is full of tourists.Check in was smooth and timely, check out was quick and pleasant.The rooftop bar is nice although super expensive.There's coin operated laundry room provided for the guests which includes 2 washing machines and a dryer, the dryer is not powerful enough and had to run multiple times to get the clothes dried.The location is all right, it's relatively close to Shinjuku (16mins walk) station, and nightlife is just around the corner.I tried their bar/cafe on the ground floor, was good.The images online are bit misleading as they show the suites rather than regular rooms which are lot smaller.Overall, I was satisfied with my stay, and I would return again with a discounted room offer, to check their newly refurbished rooms.","London, United Kingdom","-Ernie-1989</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",12,3.0

We wheeled our luggage from Shinjuku station to the hotel, not knowing that there were multiple entrances and exits from Shinjuku station. (So good to research before coming if u intend to stay near Shinjuku). The walk took a total of 15 mins. Subsequently, without the luggage and being more familiar with the route, it took 9 mins. The hotel is situated in a red light district and occasionally at night, you'll see some touting along the streets. However, it's not obvious nor rowdy, and I can safely walk with my daughter back to the hotel alone at night. Hotel - The hotel is clean and upkept although the lighting at the lobby is too dim at night. We stayed at the room for doubles. it was small but clean and tidy. Hardly any space to place 2 luggages. The bed was comfortable though. the toilets were clean and well provided for and replenished in terms of toiletries. we appreciated the aircon and heating system. We could adjust it and it kept us at a suitable temperature in the room. there was free wi-fi too! On the whole, I think this hotel is more suited for couples or singles. not so for families with children who may need a space to play and run around. Staff - The staff were generally polite and helpful. i was very impressed by the patience and kindness of the staff we met. However, there was one particular staff whose name was Seki. When we asked for directions, she seemed unwilling to help us. She threw the pen on the table, slammed the files filled with maps on the table and didn't sufficiently provide the help that we needed. She avoided eye contact and showed her displeasure on her face the whole time. I was very upset by her behaviour. Maybe she was having a bad day but it definitely did not justify the attitude she displayed. that same day, my husband approached other staff who willingly helped us and were kind towards us. for that, we are thankful. on the whole, the experience was good. the hotel is new and some taxi drivers may not be familiar with the place. will I come back? yes, if alone with my husband. thank you Granbell.",,Felicia L,1,4.0

We tried to have them call for a dinner reservation in advance of our stay but were told they don't offer concierge services. That said, they were very helpful and patient upon our arrival. Interesting and modern designs are a treat here, but are dampened by things like buzzing vending machines on our floor and an array of laundry and maid-cart accessories that were lining the hallway outside the door of our room for the entire stay.Overall, this hotel seemed to put the others in the immediate neighborhood to shame, so I would say that if you want a cool Shinjuku experience, you can clearly do a lot worse than the Granbell.

The location from an access point of view is okay, but you don't want to navigate your heavy luggage through the narrow streets of Tokyo to this hotel from the metro station. So do yourself a favor, either have your baggage delivered from the airport or book another hotel right next to the train station. Also, this is in kind of red-light district, very sketchy area filled with ladies services! As for breakfast which is not included in the room service, I had to pay 1300 yen for some cereal and super buttery scrambled eggs (tasted like anything but eggs)! Don't eat in the hotel if you stay here. You can get awesome breakfast if you go to a restaurant for even a better price!! And check-out!!

I have been traveling in Asia for a month, staying in many hotels in different countries, none treated me like this. They also hr construction going on, so it was a mess in the hallway, they gave me a room right next to the construction area in the hallway!

Talk about hi-tech! I seriously need one at home!Lovely amenities and very deep soaking tub! And if you can, get a deal with the daily breakfast! The daily breakfast unfortunately, was not part of my deal, but I tried it anyway! And yessss, their breakfast buffet is sooooo good! And what an amazing view! I was ok with not having the daily breakfast because I was able to enjoy breakfast at other spots! But if you want to save, have your breakfast included!

I recommend taking the back door of the hotel, walk 2-3 blocks to Higashi-Shinjuku Station and take the subway to Harajuku or Shinjuku Station to get back on the Yamanote Line. That will take you to all the major stations.-Your door keycard turns on the lights. I struggled finding the lights to turn on as I got to my hotel room.

Shinjuku Granbell Hotel is in a tight cluster of hotels and night spots. I couldn't quite remember when I first got there why I booked this hotel. Then I remembered, due to its proximity to The Robot Restaurant and the ""Redlight District"" of Japan. I put ""Redlight District"" in quotes because I think Redlight implies dangerous and lurid. As a solo female traveler this can be a bit touch and go, but I never felt unsafe or concerned in this neighborhood. I did like looking at the signs for the maid restaurants. It was fun neighborhood with a great nightlife and there is a donut shop two blocks away. The hotel itself is modern and stylish with the necessary amenities.

If I would go back I would not pick this hotel for that sole reason and that is why I rated it 3 starts.

This was our first hotel stay after a 14 hour flight. Our check in and front desk experience was fine throughout our stay. We received assistance with the questions we had about options for eating and getting to places we wanted to visit. The rooms were really small. The website photographs may lull you to think they are larger than they actually are. Getting into bed was ok on one side, but you need to crawl in/out of the other side. The bathroom was also small, and had a pocket door that was partially blocked by the toilet when fully open. The room and bathroom were clean and well made up. The bed was comfortable. The best part of the stay was breakfast on the 12th floor. The space is large, with many windows that show off the surrounding area. The buffet options were many, so we always left quite satisfied. The closest metro station is Higashishinjuku, about 3 short blocks away. To get to the hotel and leave when we checked out, we took taxis. The fare to Shinjuku station was reasonable. Nearby there are 7/11s where cash can be obtained. My rating of average s directly related to the room size.

Unfortunately, with this place, there are none. This hotel is located in Kabukicho i.e. the red light district. If you're a virgin, sleazebag, off your face, or just generally lacking morals, this place is ideal. If however, your idea of a nice holiday doesn't involve brothels, prostitutes or strip clubs, this isn't the place for you.Every evening when walking the 10-15 minute journey to the hotel from Shinjuku Station, we were harassed by Nigerian males continuously trying to pressure us into strip clubs and massage parlours. Sometimes they wouldn't take ""no"" for an answer and followed us down the street. We often had to take a taxi at our own expense just to avoid the confrontation. Many people comment that they never felt unsafe in Japan. I would agree with that statement everywhere but Kabukicho for this very reason.The hotel itself was the worst part of our holiday though, to the point where we didn't want to spend any time there.Our room was microscopic. You have to be a hobbit or, better yet, a Borrower. The rooms they mainly advertise online are like the penthouse suites, which gives you a really false impression of what you'll actually get. Even the pictures OF our room don't give you an accurate impression of the minuscule size.As we were staying for 11 nights, we had 2 large suitcases and 2 smaller suitcases. There was absolutely nowhere to put them whilst still being able to enjoy and use the room. We called reception and explained this, but the only alternative they gave us was to pay an extra £50 per night for another room.The bathroom also wasn't clean. We found a pubic hair on the toilet seat when we arrived (nice), and hairs in the bath. The grouting and shower hose were mouldy, and there were soap marks in the wash basin and on the taps.The bath tub was so small, I couldn't sit in it unless I had my legs crossed and I'm only 5'2.During our stay, we had to use the 'laundry facilities' at the hotel. I'd use this term loosely, as it was actually 2 washing machines and 1 small dryer for a hotel with around 15 floors.When we checked the laundry room over different days, the washing machines were always in use, so we waited until 12.30am one morning thinking we'd be able to get in.Nope.Due to the length of time we had to wait for a washing machine AND the dryer, it was 5.40am by the time we finished. When we woke the next day it was almost evening, meaning we wasted almost an entire day due to the lack of washing facilities.When I complained about this to a receptionist, she actually suggested I leave the hotel and use a laundry mart in Shinjuku. I pointed out that it was 2am at this point and didn't want to leave the hotel so late at night. She just shrugged and told me to wait then. I asked if this was the first time someone had complained about the lack of washing facilities and she said ""no, but the managers don't listen so what do you want us to do"".Whilst also waiting for a washing machine, we saw a sex worker leaving a guest's room, as well as a half naked gentleman wearing a bra and pants parading down the hallway to collect his clothes. This was made all the more disappointing as this was supposed to be our proper honeymoon combined with our first wedding anniversary. The hotel knew this, but still weren't willing to help us.I should point out though in case they respond to this review, they did give us a free gift when we checked in - 2 roses made from what looked like face cloths. Compare this to our 1 night stay in Kyoto's Hotel Granvia who took a photograph of me and my husband and framed it for us as a memento of our special stay.In a country where everyone is so friendly, helpful, hard working and polite, this hotel really is an exception. I am baffled at how many positive reviews the Granbell Hotel has on here because it was just so disappointing.Also, a note to the hotel staff, please don't bother responding to this with some copy-and-paste response such as ""we're sorry, we take your comments on board, we'll feed it back, we hope to welcome you back soon"" because that's useless. You had an opportunity to help us whilst we were there and you didn't, so any reply now will be worthless.If you really would like to apologise, a partial refund would be fantastic.To everyone else reading this though, please don't make the mistake we did. Japan is too special a place for your holiday to be ruined by a sub-standard hotel. Spend a little extra cash (it will honestly be worth it) and book a hotel closer to the station on the side closest to the Government building. The Hilton and Keio both looked lovely.We can thank the Shinjuku Granbell for one thing though: we now know what a truly horrendous hotel is, so all our holidays in the future will seem positively fabulous.","Manchester, United Kingdom","Belacqua_x</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",60,1.0

(Although I see people drunk-walking in the area in the morning) Generally Japanese people are very polite and friendly but the hotel staffs are the only ones in Japan that I've met who's rude and with poor customer service. (Not all, but my friend and I each encountered bad experiences) The woman whom I'm dealing with didn't understand what I was trying to say and started mumbling in Japanese with a frown look.

The hotel is absolutely newly renovated. We stayed in a standard room, which was decorated in modern style (somehow like a boutique hotel room in minimal style). But the room size is definitively small and without a closet. Other features of the hotel includes a restaurant, a cafe and a bar. However, it is lacked of relaxing facilities, such as a gym, sauna and Jacuzzi. Other short coming is cleanliness. There were something like tiny pieces of biscuit on the yukata provided in our room. Besides, outside the window of our room were array of antenna; I believe they affected our sleeping quality. I should have requested to change our room and I regretted I didn’t ask for. I strongly recommend others, if in case staying at that room, to change their room. The location of the hotel is okay, as explained in its official website, one has to expect a 10 minute walk from the JR station to the Grandbell.

We weren't in Tokyo to hang out in our room and were exploring basically all day, every day. I only interacted with the front desk during check-in/out and they were efficient and had my pocket Wi-Fi that I had sent to the hotel ready for me on arrival without any need to even mention it. The vending machines are nice (miss having them to count on, since they're everywhere in Tokyo) and we got a morning coffee, ice cream and even beer from them. Our room didn't include the breakfast buffet but we ate it at the hotel once. They had a nice selection and a great view. We also had drinks on the rooftop bar a couple times. They're open really late (like many things in Shinjuku) and that was nice to be able to come back to the hotel and still head up there. You may feel that beers are a little pricey, considering I can take the elevator the 1st floor and get one from the vending machine for 1/3 of the cost but they're in line with most surrounding places. The Shinjuku Granbell Hotel served as a great central hub for our time in Tokyo and I'd definitely consider staying here again in the future. There was never a moment where I felt unsafe and it's easy to avoid activities you may not be interested in that are nearby. My only tip is to ignore non-Japanese, English speakers that try to get you into their specific clubs. They stand out and are the only people in the area that walk right up to you to try to stop you in the streets. If they weren't around, the Kabukicho, Shinjuku area would be just about perfect.","Cleveland, Ohio","Michael K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cleveland, Ohio</strong>",2,4.0

The hotel is indeed in Kabukicho (red light) district and is surrounded by dozens of love hotels, but the area is super safe and often so crowded that you should not worry at all;- Rooftop: you can enjoy a terrific view of the area from the rooftop bar, which also serves good and reasonably priced cocktails. Nothing super fancy, but it is frequented also by locals or people not staying at the hotel.- Staff: although their English is very basic, they all were very kind and helpful - Cleanliness: rooms are squeaky clean, although you have to ask them daily to do the cleaning (see the CONS below)- Breakfast: not included in our rate. We tried it once and they had a wonderful buffet with both western and japanese dishes. CONS- Room size: our 9th floor Standard Hollywood Twin (which should nonetheless be bigger than Economy rooms) was indeed small, with no room for luggage and no closets at all.- Cleaning service: they won't clean your room unless you daily ask them by using the door sticker you find in your room. This is ridiculous in a 4-star hotel;- Breakfast: self service only. No table service whatsoever. Makes everything look like an overpriced Starbucks. Once again, unacceptable in a 4-star hotel, which is a pity because the food is great;- Air conditioning: the device to control the in-room A/C is located right beside one of the beds, and has a powerful green light that always stays switched on as long as the A/C is working. Therefore, if you leave A/C on during the night (as it always happens if you are in town during summertime), then the green light shines in all its glory in the darkness of the room. Bear this in mind if you require full darkness to enjoy your sleep.All in all, we did have a pleasant stay and we would recommend this hotel. There are some major cons which are unacceptable for a 4-star hotel that prevent me from giving an extra star.",Milano,"sbiriguda02</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milano</strong>",100,3.0

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a place to stay in Tokyo.The hotel itself was very sleek. We stayed in an impressive all marble/mirrored room with a fantastic view of the city. For the same rate, we found hundreds of other hotel rooms that practically only had space for two beds pushed together and looked outdated and dirty. Needless to say, we were very pleased when we found this hotel.The room we stayed in was sizable with a full size king, huge bathroom, and large living room with a massive couch. We stayed on the 17th floor and there were only 4 other rooms on this floor. The accommodations within the room were incredible and welcomed, although some were certainly unnecessary. For instance, the toilet seats were heated and featured different buttons to flush the toilet different ways and the blinds in the bathroom could be raised or drawn by the press of a button. Hey... we didn't mind though. I was also very impressed with what was complimentary as part of the stay. Our room fee included free wifi, which was of adequate speed, complimentary breakfast for all three nights, many toiletries, including bath salts, makeup cleanser, etc., and a free drink card for the lounge. Although this hotel lacked a pool and gym (which are HUGE for me), what was offered overshadowed this inefficiency. Most importantly - LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. We were able to walk to many of the must-see spots in the Shinjuku neighborhood, such as the Robot Restaurant, National Garden, Tokyo Government building, and many highly raved parks, shrines, pubs, etc. With this location, it was simple to walk outside at night and become immersed in city, walking through streets of neon and popping into little shops/restaurants.

I'm not just bashing this hotel but want to give it an honest review. Besides, the hotel had cards on the counter asking guests to review the hotel on Tripadvisor.First the good.The hotel is SUPER clean and pretty nice—it’s minimalist modern decor and is really clean.The breakfast, which was included, is decent. About what you can expect from an included breakfast :) There are some oddities (like eggs with hard yolk and soft whites, and undercooked bacon) but that is to be expected in a foreign country with different culinary tastes. We liked the breakfast.The location is central to Shinjuku, so if you are looking for over the top craziness, then the location is perfect. It is within walking distance of a metro station and about 8 minutes from the Shinjuku Train Station. One note about the reviews that talk about ""love"" hotels. Someone else said it and I agree, it's not what you think. This is not a red light district by any means. These are hotels that rent by the hour or night for young Japanese couples, and it’s pretty normal for the area. Not an issue at all—all part of the Shinjuku experience.Also, the rooftop bar is nice for a late night drinking it’s open very late so it’s a great place to unwind after a long day.OK, now the bad.We had booked 2 double rooms for my family of 4 (my kids are 18 and 23). My nephew travelled with us so we knew we had to add a room or upgrade when we got there. The rooms are TINY by even Japanese standards. The double bed is up against a wall so it’s impossible for 2 adults to sleep in it. We ended up getting a double/double for my son and nephew and my daughter stayed in the original double we had booked. Me and my wife had to upgrade to a queen. In all three rooms, the space around the bed is about a foot and a half on the side and foot of the bed (remember the other 2 sides are against a wall). The bathroom is OK, but not great. The room is clean, so that's a plus.THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. The Japanese are generally extremely courteous and helpful. The service at this hotel is bad on WESTERN standards. The desk staff is uninformed and unhelpful. Anything you ask for, the answer is no. They were very unhelpful arranging or recommending transportation from the airport to the hotel (I contacted them by email). They also knew nothing about any site seeing or places of interest, simply referring to the rack of tour brochures when asked anything. They wouldn't even get us taxis on the last day when we were leaving or book the bus from the Tokyo terminal to the airport. The day before we left, we ended up having to walk 8 minutes each way in pouring rain (typhoon) to reserve the bus.I also observed, while sitting in the lobby at the end of a day, an argument between a guest and the manager. Apparently, the guest was complaining that a woman had used a key to enter this his room (and she was available to confirm it) but the manager was having none of it. The very loud conversation lasted almost 30 minutes. A couple of thoughts: The manager should have taken this man to a private room so this argument would not be on display for all to see. Also, the manager has to think big picture here. let the guy checkout and go to another hotel, like he wanted, and forgo the 2 nights he would have collected vs risking a bad review and annoying at least 15 other guests who are sitting around watching and listening to this. So unprofessional.One thing that was not that bad, but was still very annoying was the lobby coffee bar hours. They open at 10AM, so if you are gathering in the lobby to go out for the day any time before that (which was every day) you are out of luck. It seems a bar serving cappuccino etc. should be open early in the morning. Like I said, not terrible, but strange.Overall, not a great experience. I would highly recommend you find another option for a hotel.","Pasadena, California","arthure18</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pasadena, California</strong>",10,3.0

The front desk accommodated us with little notice and since rooms are a little small in Japan and my sons and husband are tall, the girl helping us placed us in a king bed loft the first night and then moved our luggage for the next two nights to another room with two twinXL/possibly full beds and a loft. The first room was more spacious with a patio, but the second room had more bed space, a little bit more of a squeeze. It is a nice hotel, very modern and clean. Restrooms were nice and roomy for showering and getting ready. I viewed a double room and it was a very tight squeeze and beds would not have fit two tall teen boys and husband and wife, glad the lofts were available. The girl even gave us a discount on our stay, which was nice and appreciated. Nice grill and bar on the 12th floor, where we had a couple of drinks with a good view the first night.

Coffee at the bistro on the first floor was super small for $4 and it would have been better to go to the Starbucks or McDonalds. It is in what appears to be the red line district and so the nights were very lively and a little scary (although no one bothered us and I know it is safe in Japan).

Tokyo is one of the most expensive cities in the world but the Shinjuku Granbell is a fantastic option for those who want it all: price, style, location, and amenities. We booked an economy double non-smoking. The hotel is immaculate and looks very new. They are doing some expansion and we were warned about construction noise but the rooms were whisper quiet. Fun design that is very Japanese in the sense that every inch of space is efficiently utilized. If you need a huge room you may want to spring for the more expensive rooms. But you really don't need a ton of space. A little more luggage space would have been nice but it's Tokyo, just roll with it. Note: if you can't read Japanese there's a card in the drawer with the hotel information guide that explains how to adjust the aircon. The bathroom was small but great. If you haven't experienced high tech Japanese toilets you're in for a treat. Nice toiletries and free toothbrush, hairbrush, body towel etc. Coffee, tea, and water complimentary and there's a little fridge and in-room safe too. Free WiFi. Great location about 10-15 minutes walk from Shinjuku Jr station. Note: if you're planning on using Google maps know that the GPS signals in Tokyo can be very unreliable because of all of the big buildings. Easiest way to get to the hotel is to go out the Higashi (East) exit of the JR station. Walk straight out and head to the left by the rail tracks. Keep them on your left and when you get to Yasukuni Dori (by the huge LABI electronics store) turn right and then cross the street. Follow Yasukuni Dori past Don Quixote and look for Mister Donut which will be after an intersection and should be on your left. Next to the Mister Donut is a little pathway with signs to the Shinjuku Bunka Center. Follow this path all the way to the end (passing the Citadines hotel on your left and entrance to Golden Gai on your right) when you get to the end of the path cross the street and continue up the little hill (there's a Kyushu Ramen shop you should walk past, keep it on your right as you go up the little hill) follow the hill past all the love hotels (don't worry, despite being a red light area it's extremely safe and taking that path next to Mister Donut has saved you a walk through the gauntlet of touts too) Look up and you should see the Granbell Hotel (you may spot the scaffolding for the construction first) Other tips to note. The Higashi Shinjuku subway station for the Oedo and Fukotoshin lines is about 5-8 minutes walk and you can avoid the cluster of Shinjuku depending on your final destination. Don't miss the 500 yen wine and beer happy out in the lobby cafe. Hope this helps! ","Washington, DC","thetravelbeagle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, DC</strong>",88,5.0

Nicely decorated by diesel designers, with large black French doors separating the private lobby to the main room. Floor to ceiling windows throughout. The best feature about the room is the private hot bath outside the bathroom which is encased in stone and glass partitions from the bathroom. Truly relaxing and a great addition to the perfect room. The shower was rain fall and also hand held fixture. The Thai bath amenities are high end and cover all uses. (Hair tonic, gel, shine, shampoo, etc). The bed was comfortable however was more firm not a pillow top. Still had a good nights rest. There is a Dehumidifer in the room and the air conditioning was very strong and worked well. Automatic blinds and sheers surround the glass windows. The floor is hard wood and there was granite throughout. There is a walk in closet as well. Capouncino machine and free water and minibar in the lobby area. Access to the club lounge wasn't anything special. A few selections of nuts, chips and some drinks (cola, water and Perrier). The private assigned concierge was there rarely however he was helpful when he was and gave us directions perfectly. The breakfast buffet differed in quality. The scrambled eggs were barely cooked (which is common in Japan we noticed) and the sausages were raw. It offered some nice salad selections however, and some fresh fruit juices. The rooftop patio bar was closed for renovations sadly, and there was a lot of roof top noise in the morning. The hotel area is right central inside the bar, club and restaurant area. There is some shopping near by and many many Korean restaurants and stores. The red light district is adjacent to it which was pretty sketchy at night to walk the street back to hotel after dinner. You get harassed by men trying To hustle you prostitutes. It's annoying but We didn't feel really at danger just harassed constantly by swarms of them on each corner. Public transit (subway) is about 15 minute walk away from the hotel. It is a congested area on some of the streets in the day so it was a little difficult to navigate with our luggage. You could always avoid this with a taxi however they are very expensive in Japan. Overall for the price I paid for the penthouse I expected more in terms of food quality for the breakfast and club level amenities.

When we got back to our hotel room my daughter immediately noticed that someone had gone through her suitcase. She had actually taken a picture of her suitcase before we left because she was paranoid that the housekeeping people would steal her new clothes she had bought the day before in Ginza. At that time we just thought they had moved the suitcase to be able to make the bed because the rooms are so tiny.I had put 2 of my credit cards and some of my cash in my backpack that I left in our room in case I would loose my wallet in Kyoto. In only noticed the next morning the cash was gone. Luckily the credit cards were still there. I went to the front desk to complain and they got the manager. He spoke no English so the lady from the desk had to do her best in translating. They told me they would talk to the housekeeping staff and to come back that evening. Later that evening they told me that housekeeping never touch my stuff and that I should check my backpack again. I check the whole room but of course the money still wasn't there. I wrote an email to the hotel this time since communication with the manager was so difficult to tell them that the money was definitely stolen. Again they said housekeeping never touched my stuff and that all three people of the cleaning crew are in the room at the same time to avoid any suspicious of theft. I checked for the next few days if this statement was true but it wasn't. Almost always there was one cleaning person in the room, one in the supply room and one in the hall way.The hotel did offer me a discount of 10000yen ($100) which I appreciate but never apologized and kept denying any wrongdoing by their staff.",saint louis,"tonyke</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>saint louis</strong>",9,1.0

Although some reviewers have mentioned the 'seedy' establishments nearby, I never felt unsafe even walking late at night. Not too far from the train station as well. Lots of great places to eat nearby, and the hotel gave excellent recommendations. There's a gorgeous rooftop bar at the hotel and the hotel provided free vouchers for drinks when we checked in.

Our room - an Economy Double - was compact but well designed to maximize the space available: there are little shelves and compartments where you can store your things, make sure to look around and find them all. The bed was comfortable and the bedding of good quality. The curtains worked well to keep the light out in the mornings (important for jet-lagged travellers sleeping late!) The wireless worked consistently and had a good strong signal. When we checked out, we realized that we had left some concert tickets in the room. We phoned and the person who answered went and checked our room and found them. It was a great relief and a really impressive bit of customer service!For those travelling by subway, consider using Higashi-Shinjuku station rather than Shinjuku Station proper. Higashi-Shinjuku is much closer to the hotel, much smaller and easier to navigate and, at night, allows you to access the hotel while avoiding a lot of the Kabukicho melee.","Halifax, Canada","parleek</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Halifax, Canada</strong>",34,4.0

The cafe/bar downstairs does an OK coffee and has a selection of craft beers :-) The location is good and in walking distance of many things in and around Shinjuku; and you can connect easily with other subway/overground lines to get where you want to go. Negatives: The breakfast was a bit average; with a strange mix of Asian and western'ish food served buffet style. Treat it as a bonus but don't let ""breakfast included"" influence your booking.The WiFi seemed to alternate between performing really well and really badly with both slow speeds, poor reception and regular disconnect/connect events.Warnings: The location is good **IF** you don't have to cart a lot of luggage. If you've got anything more than a simple carry-on/roller, but not enough to really justify using a taxi, getting where you need to go can be painful due to just enough distance to the main Shinjuku station, and the lack of a direct line from Higashi-Shinjuku to the main Shinjuku station. You'll need to walk to Shinjuku-Sanchome or do the extra transfer from Higashi-Shinjuku. It's quicker to walk but beware of rain.Taxi wait times vary and could be 15-20 minutes. A taxi to Shinjuku JR East entry (for Narita Express etc) can easily take 15-20 minutes if there's a lot of traffic, and will cost upwards of 2000-3000 yen. Allow 45 minutes to get there.

We walked straight to all the malls in Shunjuku and also close to the Gyeon park for cherry blossoms. I recommend going to the train station through entry E2 which is on the main road. Then to Shinjuku-Sanchome station to catch the Marounochi line to most of the main areas in Tokyo. There are 2 7 elevens nearby and a great noodle place on the main road. It is next to the 'red light' district but coming back to the hotel at 2 am after shopping at Don Quixote gave us no problems and rarely witnessed anything unusual. If you want to avoid this then I recommend walking on the main road around Kabukicho. Vending machines on the G floor was convenient for some mid night snacks.

The hotel was a short walk from Shinjuku station, through Kabukicho area. We did not get to see all the debauchery until the very last night of our stay. But it was pretty mild, nothing to be worried about. We had a standard double room on the 6th floor and it was enough for us - 2 girls - with only carry-on luggage. So if you have big suitcases, space WILL BE a problem as you may not be able to open and arrange anything, unless you put them on the bed. Comfortable bed, very nice bath tub and bathroom. We filled the bathtub up and used it as an Ofuro every night, very relaxing after a full day of walking around in Tokyo. The only negative thing I'd say about this hotel is Wifi, extremely slow on the 6th floor, as someone else already mentioned. We opted for our pocket Wifi instead. Other than that, I'd add another observation, not necessarily negative, but the staff at the front desk did not seem as warm or hospitable as the other places we've stayed at in Japan, which seemed a bit disappointed. Everything else went according to what we hoped for, so we may stay here again unless we found a better value in the same area.",Miyagi,"lilliannguyen86</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miyagi</strong>",15,4.0

This hotel is in a great location, close enough to walk either to Siinkjuku station or a 3 min walk to the Higashi-Shinjuku metro. Complimentary water provided each day. The pillows were very flat and hard, I had to ask for another, which the reception happily brought up for me. I was also able to get 2 additional coat hangers with no difficulty. The wifi was not very good on the 6th floor. A couple of comments:- consider getting a coin machine for the washing machine and dryer- there are 2 washing machines which the cycle takes 30min, however only 1 dryer which takes over 2 hrs to dry those clothes. Consider getting a second dryer. The only other negatives were:- when housekeeping made the beds, they broke our phone charger that was plugged in the wall beside it, however didn't leave a note, it was just placed it broken on the bedside table. - when my friend returned to her room one afternoon, she'd found that house keeping had spilt the coffee that was sitting on the bedside table onto the sheets. It must have been them as the spill was on the sheets and not on the quilt. It seems strange that it appears housekeeping continued to make the bed and ignore the spill.

Further to that, I am on holiday to explore the city, not lounge around a hotel room all day.My room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom a good size, I wouldn't hesitate to book here again.The hotel is an easy 10 minute or so walk from Shinjuku station, once you've found your way there once you won't have any problems, the instructions on the website were good, failing that just use the GPS on your smart phone.

I got two big suitcases, one carry-on and a laptop and was trying to drag everything into the lobby. The staff saw how much baggage I had and I went back and forth from the lobby to the street where the cab dropped me off (the hotel has no place for the cab to pull in and I was left off at the street) several time, but did not seem to pay any attention or offer any helps.Then I found out that there was no shower cap in the bathroom. So, I asked the maid and she said that the hotel had no shower cap. I went down to the reception and asked for it. They said that they don't provide shower caps at their hotel. A shower cap is a necessary item for any guest who wish to keep their hard dry while taking a shower. I know that we could use a hair-dryer but why wasting time when you are very tired and don't want to spend time drying your hair. The best way is to just have a shower cap. The hotel receptionist merely said that no shower cap was provided. They were being cheap and although I understand that not everyone needs a shower cap, they should have it handy for people who need it since it costs almost nothing. From the very first night that I stayed in the room, I got a real bad allergy from the pollen and sneezed like crazy and could not sleep. I ended up sick because the room was very uncomfortable and probably full of pollen. I ended up not being able to get up the second day because I was sick in bed and only got up at around 1 pm. By the time I was going to go out and look for something to eat, I saw a note on my door saying that no full cleaning of room will be provided because it was already after 2 pm. I understood their policy and did not ask them to clean it up. When I returned to my room, I called and asked for new towels, new Yukata (pajama) and some bottled water because they did not give me or change any of these stuff. The receptionist told me that I had to go down to the front desk to pick up the stuff by myself. I told her I was sick and could not do so. She finally brought the stuff.I would advise anybody who look to book this hotel to reconsider. It may be a bit cheaper than other hotel in the area but the location is really bad. It takes about 20 minutes to reach the train station. Also, the service is terrible. To be more precise, they provided no services at all. The staff was not helpful and they don't really think about customers' needs. All they will tell you is that this is all we have and don't try to provide any extra service.

When heading out for dinner and you want great sushi or sashimi, they pre-printed pages with maps that are in walking distance.Tip #1 - when flying in to Narita Airport, pre plan the times to catch the Narita Express to Shinjuku station. I missed the train by 10mins and had a 50min wait. If this also happens to you, go and buy your 1, 2 or 3 day tourist metro train fare.

Stylish, Modern, great service, good location, small outside terrace and great rooms.Staff were fantastic, the room was great the facilities excellent.I opted for one of the superior designer double rooms and wasn't disappointed, the room was big for Tokyo with a large comfy double bed and a nice seating area. Views out over Tokyo were great. The bathroom and shower are modern and in good condition and are separated by the sink area.This room came with access to an executive common area which had supplies of tea coffee etc.The rooftop bar was a real treat with great views and good and reasonable drinks.My only grumble would be the hotels check in policy. The room was unoccupied but not available to me before 15.00pm (hotel check in time) unless i wanted to pay extra. The extra amounted to half a days rate so i decided against it. I do believe this is common in this part of the world.

The staff are friendly and courteous, and willing to help, with good English skills. I had a single room and despite the usual small-ish room area, it was light, bright and pleasant. The frosted glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom opened it up a lot. The double blinds kept it dark when needed. The bed was incredibly comfortable and there was a good sized desk space (I was on a work trip and appreciated the desk and the fast wifi). Breakfast (1330 yen) was very good. Despite the crowds of tour groups, food was plentiful, fresh and hot, and the very busy staff cleared tables quickly (a bit too quickly for me one morning). I had a buffet lunch with pasta one day which was excellent. The vending machines on the ground floor give you plenty of beer and other drinks if you need them.

There are leaflets in reception with suggestions for restaurants etc and the reception staff can happily arrange any excursions. They kindly assisted us in going to the lawsons shop to use the machine to purchase tickets for the studio ghibli museum. - excellent location. The hotel is close to the ""red light area"" Kabukichō but it is perfectly safe and lively. We walked around till early hours and were not hassled at all. There are plenty of bars and countless restaurant options of a range of cuisines within 5-10min walking distance. The JR shinjuku station line is 10-15min walk for those with JR passes which is handy. The higashi-shinjuku metro station is even closer (5mins) which can access all the major attractions if don't wish to activate JR pass while in Tokyo. The metro lines are quite easy to follow. - we found shinjuku is a much more lively and ""adult"" than the more teeny bopper shibuya area. - rooms were very clean and modern albeit very small by western standards. I shared with my wife and there wasn't much space to open our suitcase but we laid it out on the desk in the room which was fine. The toiletries provided were very good and the ""fabreeze""fabric spray was handy. - the Japanese toilets are amazing! - the roof top bar was a very friendly place to have a drink with nice views and the attentive staff were very considerate to offer heating and blankets on the cooler nights. - the free wifi was a good usable speed and streaming was fine Areas to improve/things to be aware of:- very small rooms. This hotel is more of a business hotel so rooms are tiny by western standards but are perfectly fine for individuals but there isn't much space to store suitcases in the room but can put on the desks. The beds were comfortable and bathrooms were perfectly adequate with good toiletries. - the breakfast options were fine but would be nice if had an omelette station. - there are no porters so have to take your luggage to your room yourself - the taxi drivers sometimes struggle to find the hotel maybe the postcode doesn't show up on the sat nav accurately.

The Good was the price which is quite reasonable when you consider all options. Here you will get a typical Japanese Hotel room...very small compared to western standards, but very, very clean. The cleaning staff here is 5 star. They are almost invisible, but work their magic everyday in your room. They are the superstars here.Smal, dark lobby which the ladies did not like.The location is in the Kabukicho red light district of Tokyo and considered ""seedy"" by some . A few people may consider its location as ""Bad"" or ""not so good."" I was stopped in broad day light by two very polite ,uniformed police officers who did a ""security check,"" asked for I.D. and patted me down. I am 72 years old and didn't think that I posed much of a threat. A front desk clerk had a similar experience. As the officers told me, ""here have drugs and stabbing."" I, however, found the location quite interesting and colorful though not really a venue for a family. Fortunately, Japan is still one of the safest countries in the world so being almost anywhere is not really a problem from a safety stand point.The Higashi Shinjuku subway station is about a 3 minute walk if you take the shortcut through the small side streets...totally safe even at night though dark in some places. I traveled with my wife and four friends...we were never compromised in any way.The front desk staff: Here, the ""Bad"" experience was subjective. It may have been just me, but another person in our party felt that the front desk staff were a bit ""tired of all the questions being asked about directions to places."" I believe it was just one person who gave us a negative experience, but it nonetheless colored our opinion of the staff.Most were extremely helpful in answering our questions. We did not speak the language and judging from the clientele, few did. Most of the visitors were visitors from China, the U.S, Europe and Thailand.All front desk staff spoke decent English. My personal indignation, while beginning to ask a front desk clerk for directions, was her telling me to move away so that the 'line"" could be open for other customers. When I looked behind me, there was no one around. For the most part, the front desk staff was wonderful and helpful although maybe somewhat tired of being asked the same kinds of questions over and over. It is my opinion that that is part and parcel of their duties and their job...it's the people.For the management, one person on your staff may need retraining. Unfortunately, it just takes one to taint the rest. It was our opinion that it was not a language barrier, but rather an issue of being less rigid to protocol and more flexible to individual situations. If the staff member was too busy, she should have excused herself and have some one else address my question.Still, the Granbell Shinjuku in Kabukicho will probably meet most of your needs. For my part, I will not return mainly because of its location and not because of the staff.","Maui, Hawaii","Eraldo7411</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maui, Hawaii</strong>",77,3.0

Tokyo is a bustling and crazy city with many different areas to stay in. We chose the Shinjuku area as it is highly recommended by other travelers and locals. Hotel Granbell is tucked away about a 10 min walk from main Shinjuku city or 5 mins by train from the Shinjuku to Higashi-Shinjuku line. From the Tokyo station it is only 20mins by train. The hotel is still fairly new and offers a little bit quiet from the busy end. The reception is large and offers English speaking staff. It has a small cafe downstairs for coffee and other drink. Check in process is not too long depending time of day. My wife and I chose to stay in the Designer superior room which is on the executive level (level 13 above). We have stayed at other hotels around the world and as part of these floors you are always taken upstairs with drinks and personal check in options. There was no such option provided even though we found out later this could have been a possibility. Our room was spacious with a large window looking out to Shinjuku and a little beyond. It had a comfortable bed and the bathroom was large too. This sort of space is a rare in Japan so I would recommend spending a little more to get the space or you will be literally be living in a shoebox. The room came a lot of amenities including shaving razors, shaving cream, and makeup for the ladies. Plush bath robes were provided too. There is only Japanese tv channels offered but you do have the option of purchasing Video On Demand for blockbusters. Wireless is provided but sometimes is really bad and does drop off from time to time.The club lounge provided is small and offers limited drinks and no special food. It is a good place to go and relax sometimes. Breakfast is provided as part of some packages but once again the options are limited. The hotel has a restaurant and bar facility that provides some options for lunch and dinner. I have to advise though the hotel is located close to the Shinjuku night life (red light district) area. Night times may be a little hard walking through with younger family members. The owners/ promoters aren't in your face about things but it has to be noted. From the closest Higashi-Shinjuku station you are able to travel to many attractions around Tokyo. There is the Mitsui Outlet Centre located on the same line as Disneyland. You can go to Shibuya that has many different types of experiences inclusive of shopping and the busiest crossing. The Tokyo fish market is about 30mins by train and then you can go to Tokyo central station to look around the amazing building, later venturing out on foot to the imperial palace. The Shinjuku area itself offers great eating places and shopping. Tokyo tower and sky tree are all nearby as well. If you need to fly back using Narita airport then I would recommend catching a taxi from the hotel to Shinjuku station which should cost ~ 1,100 ¥. This helps you from carrying your bags around from one train station to another.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","RegNZ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",80,4.0

Its somewhere between a typical Japanese business hotel and a more standard hotel such as a hilton.On the plus side the rooms are ever so slightly bigger meaning that you are not tripping over your suitcase and the bathroom is just a little bigger giving more of a feeling of space. The cleaning is on par with any Japanese hotel - clean! We found the bed comfortable. The hotel is definitely new. Nice amenities are included with the room even some single serve drip coffee and great shower gel etc. The two biggest negatives I can say about the room is the Wifi although free was really not fast at all and by far the worst is the lack of black out blinds. The room features a set of double blinds - a sheer and a dark blind. Unfortunately the blinds themselves do not block out light and there are gaps either side of the blind (about 1.5"") meaning that in the morning when the sun rises it just streams in. If you are like me and need a very dark room to sleep, you are going to struggle. In the end we blocked the gaps up with paper etc but its far from ideal and I did not encounter this with other hotels in Japan so its seems a strange oversight.The hotel is located in Shinjuku and essentially at the end of the red-light district. If you haven't been to Japan before then you must understand that all Japanese cities have these areas and they are very safe, you would not feel uncomfortable walking around (we were a couple), but it is not in the most central location in Shinjuku - it takes around 15 minutes to walk from the station although there is a metro within 5 minutes its not on the best line.The staff at checkin were just doing their job, nobody was rude but not that friendly either we were just another number for sure.I paid a high price for this place (around 25,000/night) and on reflection I think I would rather of just taken a more simple business hotel as we hardly spent any time in the room anyway and the lack of black out curtains/blinds was too big an issue for me.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Feedbackpro2018</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</strong>",43,3.0

There are four suites on the same floor, all of which are unique, very large and have amazing views - and they all generally book for a lot less than you might expect. The Penthouse Suite has a separate toilet and bathroom (with a double shower and large tub) off the main entryway, with a large bedroom and living room through a set of double doors. This room has floor to ceiling windows that reach higher than the regular ceiling, then a skylight above that. It's an experience I've never had in a hotel view, and I seek out hotels for their views. (The view itself is a generic view of Shinjuku, but the design of the room and its windows is very unique.)We were worried that there might be parties going on in the other suites (and we knew they were all booked), but we didn't hear a peep out of anyone else on the floor.There's a small lounge for those on floors 13 and above with free drinks and snacks, but it's basically just an office that they've put a couple tables and chairs in. Still, may as well get that free beer and wine.We tried the bar on the 12th floor, which has an outdoor terrace and a surprisingly better food menu than the restaurant next door. The food was pretty good bar food (and I don't know where else to get Taco Rice outside of Okinawa), but the bartenders seemed a little inexperienced and weren't able to recommend a popular Japanese cocktail to the Australian couple next to us. The terrace is really nice if it's open, but we ended up eating at the bar because of the cold and wind.I didn't eat the included breakfast, but my wife did and she said they actually had a lot of different types of food. It's not just a continental breakfast; she said there were Japanese, western and even Korean food options. She was happy with it, although she said it was quite crowded.The lobby is small and was constantly packed whenever we passed through it. They seemed to be having several tour groups from China come through when we were there. Almost all of the guests we saw were foreign, which isn't really a problem but was just unusual to see. At other hotels I've stayed at in Tokyo, most guests are usually Japanese. Maybe that's why the public areas of this hotel seemed a little loud in comparison.Location-wise, the hotel is in Kabuki-cho, surrounded by ""love hotels"" and host/hostess bars. This didn't bother either me or my wife, but it might bother some people. Kabuki-cho isn't really a ""red light"" district in the sense westerners might think of one, with all the dregs of society hanging out on the street. It's still just regular people, it's just that the types of businesses you see are geared towards a certain industry. The Granbell is kind of on the edge of Kabuki-cho, so it's really easy to just walk a couple blocks and be in the business part of Shinjuku. The train station is a little bit of a walk, but not too far. They will call you a cab at the front desk, but they charge 400 yen for it.","Valley Stream, New York, United States","Jeff W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Valley Stream, New York, United States</strong>",35,4.0

Good restaurants near the hotel too like Black Hole (wagyu beef). The night time is where the area around there becomes alive with bars, clubs and entertainment.

We asked whether our room would be free earlier and it was at a charge of 9000Yen - we were desperate for showers and a lie down so the money was inconsequential. We had the designer casual room which was a great size with king bed and lovely free standing bath, shower and toilet room. The decor and facilities in the room were great and faultless. Our room was at a the end of the corridor and seemed to be the meeting spot for the cleaners and all their bits and bags so each time we exited we were met with laundry, carts etc and afternoon naps were broken with chatter outside. The breakfast option was ok to get you going and for westerns especially craving breakfast cereals and eggs this is a ok option. It s rather cafeteria style but you eat and get out and about. The location was great and others have said the Istean department store food hall was a saviour as they had delicious salads, rolls and mixture of Japanese foods. We visited this at least 3 times whilst there. We dined in the restaurant one night and ate a pasta and pork and rice but one thing which is great is the rooftop bar overlooking the city - even if you have a drink before venturing out it is well worth it.

The location was the best part of the stay, near enough to plenty of stations and the Isetan which is great for food in the basement if you want to pick something up on the go. Besides that the accommodation was nice and the rooftop bar was nice to have a drink on. The food (breakfast buffet and dinner) were not great and the food options close by (we did find a nice sushi option within 2-3 min walk) were also not great. The restaurants around the area may be because we didn't go to the best options, however the area seems to be more for its clubs and bars than for its dinner and food options. The buffet was very mixed cuisine and therefore didn't have enough of any one cuisine, they also didn't have the coffee options they offer downstairs at the cafe in the breakfast area. Dinner was less than we had expected from the photos that constantly run on the TVs in the elevator. The food was again limited and the quality was not the same as shown in the pictures. The only time I would eat there is if you were out of any other option and just wanted something near by.If we were back in this location for our hotel we would take a taxi/train to another area for dinner.

Now, having been around the world and visited red light districts and/or ""seedier"" in places in the likes Amsterdam, Vegas, etc., this was by far the most unnerving location for a hotel. Through no fault of the hotel, its a 15 minute hike from Shinjuku Station that takes you through Kabukicho. Now, if you appreciate being solicited by bar girls, pimps, hustlers on the way to the hotel, by all means, this is the place to be. Granted, as long as their is light outside, you dont need to worry but when it gets dark, they come out and are pretty aggressive (i.e. put their arms around you, follow you for a couple minutes, etc.). Would not recommend this place if you have a family since they would be exposed to this on a daily basis if you come back in the evening from a long day of touristy attractions.Room: In the 10 countries and 12 different hotels that Ive stayed in during the past 3 years, the wifi in the hotel is by far the worst. The reception is spotty as best. In the 5 nights that we stayed, I would say total connect time was may 15 minutes. You can get a better, faster connection in the lobby. The Standard Twin room we had, in and of itself, was fine but dated and due for an upgrade. The amenities are standard across all Japanese business hotels: shampoo ⁄ hair conditioner ⁄ body shampoo ⁄ soap ⁄ face towel ⁄ bath towel ⁄ body sponge ⁄ shaving kit ⁄ shaving cream ⁄ toothbrush ⁄ hair comb ⁄ nightwear ⁄ hair dryer ⁄ coffee ⁄ tea. The mini fridge allows you to store some treats from your daily adventures but best of all, they provide you with new bottle water when they clean your room if you use it.Service: The best part of this hotel is their staff. They were always helpful and tried their best to answer all our questions in English. Its limited --- but there was always someone there who could speak English and they knew enough to get the point across. They assisted us with providing their recommendations for things to do in Shinjuku and greater Tokyo, helped get our bags delivered to our next hotel, and overall very friendly and service oriented.Cafe: Its average at best. With all the food places and vending machines around, best to skip unless you need your morning cup of joe.Laundry: Being on the road for two weeks takes it toll on your wardrobe. This was the only hotel of the three we stayed to have a small laundry room (2 washers and 1 dryer). Its 200 yen to wash and 100 yen to dry.

Plenty of shops of any type and price range around, very active district. While it IS a love hotel and host club area, no uncomfortable feelings or issues were present.... In fact, you might feel uncomfortable only if you mind seeing pictures of good-looking young Japanese boys (no erotics, pop-music-style posters). Staff is friendly, very helpful, speaks sufficient English. Breakfast is average: bacon is glorious and delicious, sausages are very fat, scrambled eggs have rather odd texture but taste ok. You have rice, miso soup, yummy curry sauce and other Japanese-style goods.Breakfast room has beautiful panoramic windows - very inspiring at the beginning of the day. The room (even having a Deluxe) is smaaall! We couldn't open our big suitcase properly... And no wardrobe in our room, oly a rack with hangers in the corridor (and others on the floor as far as I could see). If you are a fashionista with 3 suitcases - take a suite maybe... Otherwise, the size bothered us only on the first day. Then it was ok.In terms of toiletery they give you everything you would wish for from shampoos to shavers and hair ties, no worries if you have forgotten anything. Bed is on the hard side but you sleep very well. I often have little back pains, but did not have any in this hotel.

The staff aren’t the most polite and they are very annoying not letting anyone check in after 3pm and charge you if you wish to check in 12pm-3pm but I paid about £15 to check in early as I was so jet lagged travelling for 18 hours from the London, UK. Only downside is the staff manners and also it’s in the red light district surrounded by Love/Sex Hotels. But the rooms themselves are very clean and compact. I don’t think the size is a huge deal as the beds are very big. The bath tub is very deep and I love the electronic toilet. The rooms are cleaned daily, beds made and fresh towels. The water in the room is complimentary also which is great. I really enjoyed the comfortable room so I ended up staying there again on my final night in Japan. I was lucky to stay on my own, but if you are sharing with a friend ask for a blocked bathroom window as the bathroom shows everything with a glass window, so if you’re staying with someone you’re not intimate with, it can be embarrassing.

I am not endorsing this aspect of the area but it is what it is. Assuming you have the guts and can get into the red-light establishments, this is the place to be. In addition, adjacent to the hotel are literally 50 ""love"" hotels in that area that have '3 hour' rates, half day rates, overnight, etc. You can even be a member of some of these love hotels. Having never been in one, I assume it is for the obvious. Even though the area is edgy, Granbell is a safe place. Even the area around it is safe as all the people just come and go into these bars and hotels. They don't want to be seen so the streets have people but they go about their business. It is not seedy at all like you might find in the US. The Japanese have a little more class and discretion when it comes to this. The area is an experience worth a try. As for the hotel, it would be an excellent hotel in any area. Service is impeccable, down to the cleaning staff. They clean quietly, never interrupting you. And, are always very pleasant when greeting you....unlike their American counterparts. Front desk was always helpful and spoke English good enough to get you going. The people in the bar and restaurant were equally helpful. So, for you English speaking people afraid of staying in a Japanese hotel, don't be. I had an upgraded room on the 15th floor. See pictures. It must of been 300+ sq ft and had a huge bathroom. You could put a bed in it. It has a separate shower and toilet area. The bathtub and sink area well separated. There was a 50 inch Sony TV with a Bose like music player that you can hook your phone into. Very well appointed room. Clean, good size, and quiet. They give 3 bottles of free water per day along with a bottle of iced tea and coke. Breakfast was good enough. They had western, some Chinese, and some Japanese. Eggs and bacon everyday along with salad, bread, cereals, etc. Good enough. Although not the level of a Four Seasons or Ritz, this hotel surpassed my expectations. 4.5 stars, 5.0 stars for value, They are a smallish sized hotel but I would put it above most Marriot's and Hilton's I have stayed at. Give them a try if you want to experience something different and want to be in the middle of where life is moving fast.

We knew something wasn't quite right when we arrived - the hotel is located in a depressing area of the sex district, far from Shinjuku station and surrounded by cheap love hotels and brothels. The Granbell also offers a 'short term rate' and we noticed many potential 'sex tourists' staying as guests.We entered the noisy lobby, strewn with luggage littering the space, and were met with a cheap and overpowering scent.Matters got worse when we saw the room: although clean, our 'Superior Double Room' was depressingly small, with a stale odour and stuffy, dank air quality. The hard beds are set against a wall so you can only access them from one side, and the bunker-style window adds to an overall claustrophobic feeling. The rooms are nonetheless adequately appointed, but they are much smaller and darker than they appear in the photographs.We were immediately dissatisfied, and complained to reception twice. The reaction from staff was robotically apologetic, and they did nothing to resolve or address our concerns, so we asked to speak with a manager.The hotel manager was diffident and defensive, conceding that the hotel was not actually a four-star hotel, but that Booking.com and other sites imposed a rating, shifting the onus onto us for choosing unwisely. She seemed to feign confusion at the thought anyone would complain about the hotel, and tried to demonstrate that our dissatisfaction was unwarranted. Indeed, many of the staff seem to be under pressure, and ill at ease. We witnessed cost-cutting measures such as the offer of gifts to guests if they forewent daily room-cleaning services.The hotel does not provide any of the little extras that make a hotel stay comfortable. The front desk refused to send up milk for our coffee and tea. They don't help you with your bags. The lobby is a zoo. Breakfast is awful.

The breakfast service was good, with an adequate range of both western and asian foods and the resturant had enough room to accomodate the number of diners.If you're using public transport to get to the hotel, you might want to consider aiming for Higashishinjuku station rather than Shinjuku itself. Apart from being closer and just a 5 minute walk, it's very easy to get lost if it's your first time in Shinjuku. Use exit A1 from Higashishinjuku (unfortunately no lift to street level from this exit) and as you exit onto the street, turn to your left. Walk to the next street corner and turn left into that street (if there are any, cars will be coming up the street towards you) and the Granbell is a couple of blocks on your right, just over 100m down the street. You can see the car park and a side entrance to the hotel from this street, the main entrance is just round the corner on the diagonal street.The hotel is located a short walk away from the main hustle and bustle of Shinjuku, and as others have commented many of the surrounding establishments are love hotels that typically sell day use room plans, this does not detract from the Granbell and there was no perception of the area being seedy or unsafe. Although the Granbell does state it has day use plans available I didn't feel this was something it really focussed on and at the time we were there it was very busy with high occupancy levels (it was Cherry Blossom season).We had booked one of the two Ya Ma Tei Designer Doubles and although at 19m2 wasn't overly spacious it didnt feel cramped. It had a great view over the city (facing south) and over the rooftop bar a couple of floors below us. One of the really odd things is that the neither the staff nor the literature in the room pointed out that we had access to and use of the Club Lounge on the 13th Floor. Fortunately we had read the website and we made use of it several times - it had a complimentary view of the city looking towards the north.When checking out we got the hotel to send one of our suitcases forward to a future hotel using a luggage forwarding service which they did without issue.

This didn't cause any specific issue with the guests, but our room was pretty peculiar when you talk about privacy... the bathroom had a huge glass window with a great view... on the bed! Obviously there was no way to cover, even partially, that window so everything that was happening in the bathroom was just in plain view for whoever else was in the room.I can understand this might be ""entertaining"" for some, but it might be embarassing also for a couple and a disaster if the room was shared by friends travelling together.I don't think this is the case for all the rooms, but keep in mind to check before booking.

Getting there is a bit of a trek unless you take a taxi, which isn't advisable as you pay through the teeth....luckily the hotel is just a 5 min walk from Higashi-Shinjuku station, and about 15 minute walk to Shinjuku station. Great thing about the location is 5 minute walk away, and you are right in the heart of Kabukicho. Rooms are a bit small but still comfortable. The staff are friendly and very helpful as well. They will go try their hardest to get a restaurant reservation which I was very impressed with and we appreciated it. They even were able to get a booking at Sushi Yoshitake for us during Golden Week.Another great thing about the hotel is their rooftop bar.

We stayed in three different rooms, two of which were the same type, over seven days. We spent our first and last nights in a Superior Designer Double Studio and the rest of the stay in the Luxury Designer Double Mature. While both rooms lacked a lot of storage options, the LDDM was by far the superior room and had much more space as well as a very cool layout. However some wall hooks would have been useful as there was really nowhere to hang towels or robes. The hotel itself is busy. The lobby is fairly small and this means there are groups coming and going all the time and a lot of stowed luggage floating around. Not a bad thing but this is not an out of the way place. In fact the location was great as a base to explore Tokyo. It's close enough to to Shinjuku station as well as nightlife in Kabuki-cho (Golden Gai, Robot Restaurant, Piss Alley) along with great shopping and food. There's a series of food stalls every weekend by the nearby Hanazono shrine that we happened onto one Saturday. The breakfast offered by the hotel was awesome and totally worth getting. I still dream about the eggs at the buffet. The only downside is the laundry situation. One washer, two dryers and you will most likely be hang drying your clothes in your room. The staff was great and spoke English well enough to help us find where to go and even book dinner reservations.

Our trip around Japan started here in Tokyo at the Shinjuku Gran Bell. On day three we are checking out and heading north to Nikko. We have had a wonderful experience here and found this hotel a perfect place to recover from the time change and experience the sights and sounds of this special area of Tokyo. Traveling from Colorado, we knew our rooms would be too small for the four of us so we booked two and the hotel was kind enough to make sure they were side by side. We had spoken to the staff a few months in advance by phone when we booked our rooms. They were very helpful with our reservation in English. That courteousness and friendliness has been extended throughout our stay and I must say that we have felt very content here with our experience. I can't imagine a better experience overall. Our rooms did not have an adjoining door as this is a purely Western idea and we found no hotels in Japan that have this sort of design. However, we are connected via text by our pocket Wi-Fi that we rented from Japan-i-can and had delivered to the front desk at our hotel the day we arrived. *Note: This is a key technological component for travel in Japan. For a total trip cost of about $80 US, we carry this little wireless router around in our backpack and our phones are constantly connected to the Internet. With unlimited data for the two weeks that we are here, we have access to all of the maps and apps that we need to thoroughly explore this beautiful country. (I've also been able to check my bank accounts, credit card accounts and everything else that I need and have at home.)The restaurant here is on the 12th floor with a beautiful view of the rooftops of surrounding Shinjuku area of Tokyo. The breakfast buffet is very good with lots of choices. However my wife disagrees completely. Most of the food is cold and unfortunately there is no fruit. Nevertheless, we are leaving the restaurant again today full and ready to check out. * Note: for a great breakfast try Café Aaliya not too far away. They have the best French toast in the world. Okay so here are the details. Beds are eight out of 10. We like firm beds. If you like soft beds you're not going to like these beds. Sheets eight out of 10. Cleanliness of the hotel is a 10 out of 10. And yes the rooms are small but all the rooms in Tokyo or small unless you're paying $700 a night.  The air conditioning was excellent. Coming from Colorado, I was a little concerned about the heat and humidity as my wife and I don't sleep well if we are hot. We slept well and the room was very quiet. Overall we would recommend this hotel for numerous different types of guests. The elegant entrance is on a side street and has a welcoming and verdant access. Yes verdant in downtown Tokyo. We experienced a mix of families and students and business travelers staying at this hotel. The hotel's somewhat concerning juxtaposition near the love hotel district of Shinjuku has been a non-issue for us. Had I not read about this ahead of our trip, I would never have noticed while we were here. And our children will go home not having known at all that this was a concern for for us. Great showers, laundry service if you want (we didn't), friendly English speaking staff,centralized location, easy access, clean and modern decor all lead this family to recommend staying here for other families.

Small room as expected for all tokyo room but we are surprised that the bathroom is of a comfortable size which is a true delight. It's ok for us to have a semi-transparent glasses , basically you juz see the shadow when the one in the bathroom is real close to the glasses.

We love the sofa area as well, classy and provides space for you to sit instead of just on the bed all the time.We have 2-hand carry suitcases, so they fit to the room and can be opened most of the time.LocationNot the best in shinjuku, but good enough. Next to the red-light area with many ""hotels"" next to it, not a big problem for us (2 girls), we still feel safe to walk back at night around midnight.

We do understand their difficulty after seeing those hundreds of luggage at the lobby probably also waiting for the room ready, but we don't appreciate much with the service as others mentioned in the review. When we are back from the hotel at night, the staff looks less stress than the one on duty in the morning. At least we saw his smile and kindness. The bags were in the room already which is out of our surprise, as they needs to handle all hundreds bags accurately. Or the hotel would be thinking of adding more manpower in the morning due to the flight pattern of the city? Just some of our thoughts.We didn't get to talk with the staff on suggestions as they seems have prepared all the details in the travel brochure rack. It's kind of a good idea as everything on the paper is suggested by themselves and well written in English.

It takes some time to walk from Shinjuku station, which can be a drag if you have a lot to carry. Kabukicho is the red-light district of Tokyo. You’ll see plenty of love hotels, hostess clubs and massage parlors in the area. Walk here at night and you will be approached by touts on every corner, some of who may be assosciated with seedy activities. I was travelling solo, I walked the area alone plenty of times late at night, and I always felt safe. It might not be the prettiest area for a family vacation however, and some might find the touts bothersome.The hotel should receive credit for very modern facilities. Everything seems new and clean, including bathrooms. The view from the top floors and bar was also lovely.The room was quite small, but I had smaller in Japan. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. I had a room at one of the top floors, with windows facing the rooftop bar several floors below. I was kept awake by loud guests. The doors to the room seemed to be made of paper, so noise from the hallway was also noticeable. Not ideal if you’re a light sleeper.The wifi was the worst I’ve seen in years. Expect extremely slow speeds and frequent disconnects. I found it barely usable for important tasks, and chose to find wifi outside the hotel on a few occasions.The breakfast was not enjoyable. Staff seemed stressed and was not welcoming. The pots were left open at all times, so much of the warm dishes got cold. Arriving around 8 am, long before breakfast was closing, I found some of the vegetables had dried out.I found this hotel to be poor value for money. While everything is new and the view is great, this hotel does not deliver on basic functional levels such as sleep quality and breakfast.

The TV had this annoying motion sensor so every time you would pass by after putting the power card in its slot, the TV would always turn on. Whoever redesigned this rooms should also have put into consideration the users of the room. The hallway also reeked of cigar and tobacco(so did the elevator).

As a result, the translucent window glares light and transmits all sounds between the 'sleeping area' and the 'washroom'...this is absolutely ridiculous. Whoever that designed the hotel rooms never considered about the actual users and how the users will use the room I stayed with my partner. So whenever he was in the washroom, I can hear everything (toilet or shower). He tends to wake up before me, so I immediately wake up once he enters the washroom. And when I go to the washroom during midnight, he is awaken. The rooms here are considered pretty big for Japan, fitting a queen size bed easily. But the design, again is ridiculous. They have a useless sofa on the edge of the room, taking up potential useful space. We have two luggages and if they're opened, there's no walking space. There's no closer space. They designed this room to look nice aesthetically in photos, but when you actually use the room, you will find how impractical it is. Most importantly, I Truly detest the area. It's my first time to Japan and I did not know where this hotel is, I just saw it was a 10ish minute walk to JR. However, the walk from JR to the hotel is a nightmare. You will walk through their red light district. And you will walk UP HILL. It's horrible because 1) I'm tired after a full day of walking 2) it's my 3rd day at the hotel and I still can't really remember how to get to/from JR-hotel because there's so many 'streets' and turns. 3) I never realized how big shinjuku station is--I can never find the 'right' exit so we end up detouring the station to get back to the hotel 4) there's no convenient store around (you must use their vending machine at lobby --but they do have some good selections ). But this poses inconvenience. It's the neighbourhood that raises a red flag for me. All the AV rentals , night clubs (gentlemen's) and many many love hotels that you must walk past in order to get to hotel from JR makes me feel very unsafe walking back. Also, because there's many bars around the area, you wil find a LOT of drunks at night. Another reason for red flag. Shinjuku itself is a great tourist area. But I do not recommend it for staying as accommodation. The hotel itself, the room gets a big thumbs down. The staff is so-so. They were not particularly helpful/nice/mean. Very neutral. My experience was with a gentlemen that checked us into our rooms. He spoke in decent English. He was polite. I wouldn't say they were 'friendly' or 'helpful' though. The key thing is, I didn't feel welcomed. Probably because no staff was smiling, which is very different to the other hotels I've stayed in (Japan and North America). I don't recommend this hotel for couples or girls. Especially if you will stay out past 9, because that's when the crowd gets rowdy and things go wild--it will make your walk back a bit uncomfortable (at least that's how I felt). Also, most of the 'good' food (recommended on trip advisor) is on the opposite side of JR station--east side. So it's a bit of a walk since this hotel is 15 minute walk from the west side of JR.

The hotel is clean and modern, and seems to cater for people younger than us, although this was not an issue and caused no inconvenience to us. The room was small, which we expected, and was an excellent example of utilising every inch of space to good effect. It had everything we needed. We faced a street but heard no noise whatsoever and slept peacefully. Breakfast (included in the price) was good and the view from that floor is excellent. Two things that need attention in our opinion are, the lack of English speaking TV programs (inexplicable in an international hotel) and the lack of English at Reception (again, somewhat puzzling in a hotel of this type). On the latter issue, there were staff who spoke good English, but this was a bit of a hit and miss situation. All staff were friendly and helpful. We would stay here again.

Our room was on the 16th floor, a Deluxe designer double (casual) which was spacious and very clean. By no means is the room as large as it looks in the photos provided on the website but there is enough space for suitcases while still being able to move comfortably around the room. The closet space is almost non-existent but enough to hang a couple a things. The bathroom has a large bath and separate shower, it is quite large and very well stocked! There is a mini bar and tea and coffee facilities within the room. All of the TV channels are in Japanese. Wifi is available in the lobby and rooms but did not seem to work in the bar or restaurant.The hotel is in the Kabuchiko area which is known as the redlight district, whilst there was a lot of people standing around on the streets we were never bothered and never felt unsafe (after a quick google we found out these people are often outside to draw people into the many establishments which line the streets). The hotel is 5 minutes walk away from the Higashishinjuku metro station and approx 10-15 walk away from the Shinjuku JR station. Breakfast was included in our booking and consisted of a mixed Western/Japanese style buffet. Each morning items such as scrambled eggs, breakfast sausages bacon, hash browns, toast, brioche buns, congee, pork rolls and a salad bar were available. The dining room is clean with a view of the surrounding area. On one of our more busy days we visited the hotels restaurant which we felt to be quite underwhelming, the staff were very rushed with their service almost to the point of being rude. The food was very average and the menu is quite limited which was disappointing, thankfully there are a lot of great places to eat in the local area. We also attended the hotel bar, unfortunately on the night we went it was extremely windy and the inside/outside linking doors were closed. The drinks again were average served in a straight glass with no real presentation. We also had access to the lounge as we were on one of the higher floors which had drinks and a couple of snacks such as nuts etc available but we did not feel the need to visit it other than to have a little look.We felt that overall the hotel was great! Our room was beautiful, with a fantastic service each morning. The breakfast was fine to get you going in the morning and the staff (with exception to the night we ate dinner) were all lovely and friendly and happy to help.

The rooms indeed are small, but it's Tokyo where everything is small. Learn to pack light and you will fit fine. The rooms are clean and bright with a great bathroom, water pressure and soaking tub. Only cleanliness issue I had was that the surfaces need to be dusted on a more regular basis. With that in mind, you might rinse the provided coffee mugs/cups before using. The other downside is they do not provide restaurant booking services, which is the main reason we visited Tokyo. This was a huge bummer and we ended up having to find another paid concierge service to make reservations for us. The coin laundry's one dryer was broken during our stay so we had to dry our items in our room the following day. Laundry services were pretty expensive (900yen for 1 pair of jeans).The location is near a dicier area (Kabukicho) but nothing you can see on the street is even remotely sexual so if you are with your family it's still better than walking through Bourbon street in New Orleans. You might see some drunk people passed out in the mornings on your way to the train station, but if you walk a different path that doesn't cut right through that neighborhood (or take the pedestrian park next to Golden Gai) you will avoid any of these scenes. It is also conveniently located near other subway stops to get to other parts of town. I especially loved the location near Golden Gai. In the past I've stayed in other parts of Tokyo and had to leave Golden Gai before midnight to catch the last train.I think a lot of people are expecting a high-end hotel based on its modern furnishings in photos. It is not. Service definitely has a lot of room for improvement and they seem to be understaffed. Everyday in the lobby there was a huge check-in line, lots of people waiting around, and large collections of luggage stored against any free wall. This could annoy some travelers of a certain pedigree I suspect. The free wine ticket is only for the restaurant and you must purchase something else to get the free wine. This was not clear on the ticket. The rooftop bar is a nice respite but also could improve on its service. In the end you get what you pay for.Cab drivers seemed to have a hard time finding this hotel, so be prepared and have a copy of the hotel name and address in Japanese printed out or on your phone. We also used Uber a few times, which was cheaper than a cab, and they seemed to have no problem finding us.I would stay here again if I didn't need restaurant concierge services and found a good early booking deal.","Austin, Texas","yimayy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",13,4.0

With the Executive Rooms, you have access to the Executive Lounge on the 13th floor, which provides drinks, snacks, etc from 9am - 10pm every day. Our room was on the 13th floor, which had a great view of the skyline, which was awesome at night while sitting in the gigantic tub in the gigantic bathroom. The rooms are key card protected, so only 13th floor people can get into the hallway where the rooms are, which is nice if you're worried about safety.Other Pros:-Rooftop bar (which is cool when it's not raining, which it did almost the entire time we were in Tokyo)-Very close to several metro an JR stations (5 minute walk)-An insane amount of choices for eating -While it says ""kabukicho"" as the location, it is about 5 minutes from what I would consider the actual kabukicho (with the dancing girls, hard sales approaches, and golden gai). That being said, if you're into that kind of thing, it's really close and a short walk home after you've been drinking all night - bars are open until 5am!-Free breakfast that had rotating selections. A good selection of both Japanese and Western choices such as scrambled eggs, toast, miso soup, salad, etc. -Toilet had a separate area and had all of the bells and whistles you would expect from a luxury Japanese toilet. -Friendly and helpful staff. We only had housekeeping twice during our five days by our choice, but they did a great job and refilled our fridge with the complimentary beverages.-Great bathroom amenities that go above and beyond anything you could find in a Western hotelCons:-Must have key in the slot for the lights to work. And, when you stick the key in the slot, it auto starts the TV and some really annoying loud music. There is no way to turn this off.-No top sheets! (But this seems typical for most of Japan)-For such a large hotel, the bar was pretty dead. Prices were pretty high for drinks too compared to some of the other places in the area-No check in until 3pm, which was very firm. They rope your luggage together in the lobby with everyone else's - which didn't seem all that secure to me. All in all, we had a great stay at this hotel. I would definitely stay here again.

Also if you enjoy being addressed by your name in reply emails (during an email conversation with the hotel - during which I always signed my name - they kept replying with ""Dear Madam"". And then later they even wrote ""Dear Sir/Madam""! It's not really a huge deal, but just the little things that add on to our existing frustration with this hotel).We got a good deal on this hotel through Expedia at less than AU$150/night during a weekend of the Spring school holidays. We wanted to stay in Shinjuku in hopes of being convenient to travel outside of Tokyo from the station. But this place is a good 10-15 minute walk to Shinjuku Station, so that plan didn't really work out.Our first encounter with the hotel's lack of service was during our planning. Many nice restaurants in Japan don't allow international guests to book directly with them, it must be booked through their hotel. We've done this before, so figured this would be easy. But Granbell said they would not help us book due to potential no-shows. We were willing to provide credit card details or any source of guarantee that they required, but they would not help us, despite the fact they were well aware they were our only option due to the restaurants' booking policies.Second encounter was asking for some help regarding tickets to an attraction that we wanted to visit on the day of our arrival. They replied with ""check with the concierge on your arrival"", which defeats the whole purpose of our request in the first place!Next - upon check-in, we clearly had too many bags to carry ourselves but they did not even offer to help, when most other hotels would automatically take your bags for you.Again - we called guest services to request fresh bottles of water as we had not had our room cleaned that day. They told us to go down to reception and pick them up ourselves. That's like being asked to go to the housekeeping cupboard and pick up our own fresh towels! It's just not what you expect from a hotel!And lastly, we requested some help with Ta-Q-Bin services. Two of our previous hotels were really helpful - all we had to do was tell them where we wanted our luggage to go and when, and they did all the rest for us! Granbell was adamant about us having to do everything on our own. Even one easy phone call to help us out (as our Japanese skills are pretty lacking), was out of the question. We offered to organise everything and just have them greet the Ta-Q-Bin folk when they came to pick up our goods, and they were very hesitant about that too.The following morning we asked for help again to a very unfriendly staff member. She seemed annoyed that we were expecting anything from her, and actually gave us the wrong information (told us we could pick up Yamato forms from the Post Office which was 24 hours - both of which were incorrect). We went back to the hotel after our trip to the Post Office, but this time we had a nice staff member (I wanted to get her name but they don't wear name badges). She helped us call Yamato a couple of times to figure out that only local Japanese can send international Ta-Q-Bin, not visitors. We could have saved a lot of effort if the first lady would have just helped us call and confirm.We also happened to leave something behind in our room. We've done this at other places before and they have always helped ship it back to us (once they did it at no charge, and another time we had to provide credit card details for the shipping cost). But this hotel refuses to ship internationally, and we had already left the country! So we had to find our own way of getting the item back to us. Of all the hotels we could have left something behind at, it had to be at the one with the worst service.So that's our experience with service. The hotel itself - It is in a pretty dodgy area and you have to walk a long way through that from the station to get home. The hotel itself is pretty new, so we found the lack of security kind of weird - most new hotels (and even most old ones) require room keys to get up to the required floor, but this hotel allows anyone onto any floor.And then the room - we stayed in an Economy Double so it was small. We had to keep our standard sized suitcase closed all the time so that we could walk through the room. Luckily we had a couple of hand carries to live out of for our few days here. Also, would not recommend staying here with a friend who you're not that close with. The bathroom and bedroom are separated by a glass window, so no matter where you are in the bedroom, you will have full view of anyone showering or on the toilet.There's free wi-fi, but it cuts out after some time.We would never stay here again.","Perth, Australia","brown-and-cony</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",156,2.0

Love hotels that surround the district are merely there for engaged/dating couples to meet as Tokyo is so crowded that they usually cannot have privacy at home. To us it was more entertaining. The red light district does not affect you in any way.We stayed in the CLUB suite and it was very spacious, (60 sq m) luxurious and incredibly comfortable. Wonderful views and spotlessly clean. Bottles of water along with lavish toiletries supplied daily. WIFI is great and only slows down occasionally. Huge flat screen tv, sorry, no English options but very funny and entertaining Japanese variety shows!Breakfast was the highlight, with a huge variety and adorable staff, always polite and welcoming. Best scrambled eggs amongst other tasty items. Try the tangy, crispy muesli with yoghurt, delightful. It can get crowded, so time yourself. 8 am is usually best, if there is a queue, go back later, nothing runs out and is replenished regularly.Reception staff do struggle a little with Engilsh, but there are a couple of staff members that communicate well. Use google translate if you have to.We had a small problem with a late checkout, but after a little negotiation, they obliged.The hotel is approximately a $10 taxi ride from Shinjuku JR station and a 2-3 minute walk to HIGASHI_SHINJUKU station which is only 2 stops further from Shinjuku JR.Screen shot the railway map to assist getting around as it can be difficult to navigate. Collect free maps from the stations. The JR railway site is very easy to use and most stations have customer service assistants who are very helpful.Use your Lonely planet guide to find food such as dumplings and ramen and ask the hotel staff for recommendations. There are '7-11' stores everywhere which have great gourmet lunch options if you're on a budget or simply want a quick meal.Do not miss SHINJUKU GYOEN NATIONAL park. A colourful burst of precisely maintained cherry blossom gardens, with amazing Cherry blossom soft serve ice cream on offer (during cherry blossom season). Pack a lunch and enjoy it there.

They informed us that the whole hotel was booked and then offered us a room in another hotel of the same chain, with less rating and 5 km away, she kindly offered a discount but we immediately saw that the same room was still available at half the price she was offering through any online booking site. We spent 2 hours negotiating the price, something I would had never expected in a country like Japan i felt like I was bragging with a taxi at Bangkok, but instead I was in a high standard hotel at Tokyo. We finally get to a reasonable price and went to the other hotel. The location is not the peaceful surroundings of Shinjuku Granbell Hotel but instead a noisy popular street full of night clubs and drunk people, the staff at this hotel (Asakase Granbell Hotel) pressed us to pay before we could even inspect the room and the views are inexistent.At the moment of writing this review we are still at Tokyo and our plans for enjoying the city have been completely ruined.

The Granbell is more than up to scratch: it's a modern, lively hotel with very good service in one of Tokyo's most vibrant districts. To deal with one of the criticisms here, be careful what room you book. Japanese hotels traditionally have smaller rooms, but ours was lovely and had a full wet-room bathroom. Also book carefully for style: the Granbell is situated in love-hotel territory, and whilst they're very subtle about it, there are some rooms that are more gangster-brothel-chic than might suit a family audience!Service is excellent (our 430am checkout was hitch-free), the rooftop bar is lovely, and you're in a great part of town for heading out- which is why I'm glad breakfast runs until 11am.Thoroughly recommended.Tips: - Got suitcases?

Lobby is cool with designer boutique vibe, staff always helpful with both preprinted sheets for popular destinations like ramen, skytree, tsukiji fish market. Also I enquired about studio ghibli at 10pm at night and staff stthan fill helped and told me of opening hours and method to get there despite I have to prompt the questions etc as they only answer what is being asked and not proactive but they are understandable in English and friendly.as we spent 3 days in hakone we were lucky enough to be able to leave behind our unneeded luggage from 17 to 19 without an issue, but suggest no valuables left behind as the luggage is not stowed away in lock away area and just left in lobby. We stayed in 2 rooms as we stayed 4 night from 13 to 16 and another 4 from 19 to 22. We stayed 13 to 16 march 2015 inside loft styled 3 ppl room first at ground floor which was very clean which is awesome. there was great vibe with the loft and third bed up like the attic, just be weary of the staircase up as it is steep and you must plan your toilet visit if you sleep in attic bed.. the amenities including soap and shampoo was excellent and no smoke smell to be smelt of. however the fridge was never cold and no wardrobe available only 4 coat hangers and room a bit small but its ok. you play around with tetris to fit in your luggage for 3 ppl. excellent tv as it is a sony bravia and phone is cool and a cool design radio. ground floor was quiet suprisingly. now the second room also a loft but on 12th floor, very impressed. it's same price as ground floor loft but better view plus the room included a projector so me sleeping in the attic bed can use it, cool gimmick. but pointless as i do not have usb stick or dvd and not connected to tv. however if you dohave dvd you can use it as it projects onto the windows projector screen, you can create own movie theatres. But the attic area alot nicer vs ground floor with a table on the open ended side of attic and 3 large comfy cushions and carpeted floor for cushiness. this room overall same layout except more bed to tv space as there's no tv cabinet so more room for luggage. the room is nicer than ground floor as it is fitted out with wooden interiors and carpet. carpet smeltof no smoke. Very chic in design. the 12th floor was also the ladies floor thus we as ladies got shiseido samples and liners to use, great touch of details. attic bed was comfy and pillows were good. warm blankets. very clean bathrooms. free wifi in hotel so its excellent and shinjuku has many places that includes free wifi like drug stores and the travel japan app with 200,000 hotspots so you can go online for free for up to 2 weeks. we didn't get to use breakfast or cafe so can't comment. cost is pricier vs other 4star options but cleanliness is key. if you book loft you must do it at least 3 months plus as not many rooms available. real downside a little bit far but acceptable and I would stay here again.","Hong Kong, China","yanange</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",7,4.0

The property is not ideally located if you are looking for convenience – you can’t access it easily from the train or airport bus, there are few shops and food options immediately nearby and it is difficult to get taxis. As with most Japanese hotels at this pricepoint, the front desk staff are completely inflexible in terms of early check in, so it is not a great option if you are arriving off a flight first thing in the morning and are in need of a freshen up.The hotel seems to have been embraced by mainly Chinese and Western tourists. A Japanese friend told me that Japanese people wouldn’t want to stay in this ‘dangerous’ part of town, however I didn’t experience any issues walking around the immediate area.Overall I think it is a case of style over substance.

My only complaint is that the ""concierge"" was awful. This is a city where you rely heavily on recommendations and directions from your hotel, but every time I asked for guidance I was handed a lame preprinted sheet of options. They could not give tailored options at all, and the maps are useless. One night I took a taxi to one of these restaurants only for the driver to be completely lost and confused, and once he found it I was dropped off at one of the busiest areas, trying to match the restaurant's Japanese name against 100 different signs and never found it.

It's few minutes away from the metro and Shinjuku main station. Walkable distance to the shopping area. It's great for both business and holiday.We stayed in a Superior Designer Double Studio for 3 nights in Tokyo. The room we stayed look exactly like the pictures they showed on their website. I love the big window facing the city. It looks great both in day time and night time. The room is not big but with very smart design to make it doesn't look as small as it is. It's amazing to be able comfortably place a nice sofa in the room. Little detail like bluetooth speaker and air-purifier are very impressive. I love the design of the room very much. The hotel divided into 3 parts. Standard rooms, Loft Rooms and Executive rooms. Superior Designer Double Studios are considered as an executive rooms. They are located on 14/F -16/F (17/F is the top of the building). So you would get great view of the city. We also gained the access to use the Club Lounge on the 13/F. It's good to have a drink and some snacks there. The toiletries of the room are also amazing. In most hotels, even five stars hotels, you would expect shower gel, shampoo, hair conditioner and body lotion. You might see bath salt in a really good one. In our, apart from what I mentioned, they even provide something I have never expected. Things like makeup cleansing gel, cleansing foam, lifting moisture lotion, lifting moisture emulsion, moisturising lotion, hair tonic (I've never heard of this product, but my scalp really felt great after using it) and hair gel. All the toiletries they provide are in good quality. This is really very impressive.The only thing I really think they should improve is the breakfast. Compare with most other hotels in Japan. The breakfast Granbell provides is quite weak. The breakfast restaurant reminded me of the canteen of my university. Totally self-serviced. Very little choices on either western and Japanese food. They can still fill your stomach for sure but nothing really fancy. I saw another review complained about the speed and stability of the Wifi.

In gist, the hotel is great but the location was so-so.The hotel is located in the Kabuki-cho district, which is a red-light district in Shinjuku but both my cousin and I did not feel uncomfortable when I was there (but hey, I resided in Geylang for a good 10 years, which is the red-light district of Singapore so I could be immune). In terms of location, the hotel is quite a considerable distance from the Shinjuku JR station but it is quite near to the Higashishinjuku metro station. As I was travelling with my JR pass, I chose to walk from the JR station and it was a tough walk with my luggage (hilly and rough paths).The hotel room was small but tastefully decorated with a sofa and a small window. Everything was clean and new and they even had bedroom slippers (pet peeve of mine as I don't like to step on the carpet in my bare feet)! Though the bed was smaller than the standard queen bed, it was good enough for me and my cousin. Cleanliness was tops in the hotel for me. :) The room was also brightly lit, which makes my cousin and I feel really comfortable (scaredy cats we are).If you don't mind the walk to the JR station or that you have to take the metro line to get to the main station (which is an interchange for many train lines), and if you don't mind that the hotel room is slightly on the small side, I would strongly recommend that you can choose this hotel. :)","Singapore, Singapore","gillianthetraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",2,4.0

Should not even be a factor. I wouldn't even know it unless I was looking for it - perhaps we never walked southwards. We felt safe walking around.The only thing I don't like about this hotel is the reception. Yes, most speak English, and some have an attitude problem. I was checked in by a graveyard-faced receptionist after 14 hours travel, no smiles, nothing that might be remotely construed as welcoming, not a hint of helpfulness as to which eateries would be recommended at that time of the night. They also misplaced an internet dongle package for 3 days which caused me a lot of problems having to liaise with the sender who correctly insisted they have sent it. Although the manager did apologized after that.If you find a good deal, this hotel may be worthwhile.

The gym was inside a mall so no signs on the front of the building but hotel staff did not mention this. They also failed to mention that when you get there you need to change your shoes, I changed at the hotel and walked over to the gym and they refused to let me in if I didn't rent shoes from them. Pretty unpleasant to rent running shoes other people have worn and of course I need my proper running shoes to run. So back to the hotel and I think I will do staircase running, but no, the staircases are locked for emergencies only. So if you need to work out pls take note of this before you go to the Oasis gym if wearing proper running shoes is important to you.Back to the hotel.

Floors are scratched, carpets stained, traces of the luggage visible on the walls. Like in the Shibuya branch, they forgot to plan in a luggage storage room, so it's just kept in a corner of the lobby under a net - not very elegant. On the positive side, the beds are very comfortable. Lighting inside the rooms is good, with plenty of options for a cozy indirect light. All the amenities one expects from and upscale business hotel are offered. Wireless is fast. And check-in/out was efficient. The hotel is in the middle of Kabuki-cho, about a 15 minute walk from main Shinjuku station, though only a few steps from the Higashi-Shinjuku station. With the Hotel Gracery set to open just around the corner in a few months, it will face some stiff competition.

The hotel is brand new and I was really hesitant when I booked it. The are didn't convince me from what I remembered from my last time in Shinjuku. It also didn't convince me the fact that this hotel offers rooms at prices from very low budget to very high budget. Some rooms are worth it and probably some aren't. This also makes for a very diverse group of guests (could be good or bad). When we checked in Nana Hatsugai was there to help us with the process. She was truly amazing. I mentioned it was our honeymoon and she upgraded us to a club level room. With access to the club lounge and breakfast. I had previously requested a high floor and she granted us that, she gave us a room on floor 16 with floor to ceiling windows. A really nice room with an industrial feel to it (very brooklyn!). We got to enjoy the club lounge specially from 5-7 when they serve wine and beer. While it is quite different from most club lounges I have been to before it was very nice to have been given this as a compliment. Breakfast I must admit could be better. The offer is not quite four stars. I'm sure this is something they are working on. I got the impression it is more intended for the asian travelers than the westerners. For example, being Italian, the fact that there is no espresso in the morning is unacceptable; yet again, it was complimentary so I can't complain!During our stay we continued to see Nana Hatsugai at the front desk and she was amazing with everything we asked her about. She was very knowledgeable about tourist destinations, how to get to them, opening hours, etc. Also, I couldn't end this review without mentioning how great her english is, which is rare in Japan and even in this hotel, not everyone at the front desk. This makes things very easy since my Japanese is close to nothing. To end up my review, we had a wonderful stay at this hotel, all thanks to Nana Hatsugai who present from beginning to end. Maybe we were lucky or maybe that is how it is with everybody, that I cannot say. What I can say is, as long as she works there I will be coming back!

Staff have a fairly firm command on the requisite English, so if you're an international traveller you shouldn't struggle.We stayed in a modern/mature room on the 13th floor, fitted out in a hardwood and glass style that was very sleek. The room had all of the expected amenities and more - including some decidedly upmarket shampoo and personal care products. If you stay in a decent room here (Floor 13 and above) then you also get access to a complimentary exclusive lounge on the 13th floor where you can help yourself to free snacks and soft-drinks/tea and enjoy an amazing view.In terms of food, the 12th floor has a substantial dining area for the guests to have breakfast - which was a fairly wide and enjoyable buffet of eastern and western fare. There's a coffee shop on the ground floor near the lobby for brew-hunters and a bar that opens on 13th floor after 5pm, serving drinks and some hot snacks.It was intensely refreshing to have a bath after a long train ride from Hokkaido - and the centre-room all smoked glass shower is very well made.

Our room and some others gives access to the Club lounge, which, though smaller than I was expecting, was a perfectly comfortable spot for the free wines and nibbles served each evening, or coffee and juice during the day.Breakfast was actually the best I had in Japan, because although it's a buffet, there's a good selection and I was able to eat light, healthy and recognisable items. All my other experiences of 'western style' breakfasts in Japan were nothing of the sort! The restaurant wasn't up to much for dinner, but on our first night we were too tired to explore outside.It only takes 7 mins to walk to Shinjuku station and Tokyo's metro can be accessed 3 mins walk away, so the location was good.

Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was nice and it was nice there was a deep (but not long) bathtub in there. Our last stay in Tokyo at a more expensive hotel in Shibuya only had a shower. I extended my stay at the Granbell and the reception staff were easy to deal with and offered me a competitive rate for staying longer at the hotel.A few tips:- We stayed at the hotel with 4 other friends, both sharing similar Economy Double Rooms. Both of them were inititally placed into rooms that have a window seperating the bedroom from the bathroom, but there is no curtain between the bathroom and bedroom. So....whomever you are sharing the room with has to see you on the toilet/shower. Needless to say they asked to change rooms to a room with a curtain. Just something to consider. I really have no idea why the Granbell thought having rooms with a full window into the bathroom/toilet and no curtain was a good idea.-Our room keys became de-activated about 5 different times throughout our stay, we kept having to go to front-desk to re-active them. I eventually suspected that keeping the room key in my wallet besides my Pasmo/Suica tokyo transit cards might have been causing the hotel room cards to error out. If the same thing happens to you, keep your room card away from a Suica/Pasmo card.-There is no English language TV channels. I know that might seem like a small detail in such an exciting city but during downtime if you want to watch any English tv or movies be prepared to pay Y1,000 (approx $10) a day for a Video On Demand card from the vending machine. -The rooftop bar on the 13th floor is great. A bit expensive, but great. -The closest subway station to the hotel is Higashi-Shinjuku Station, if you are travelling to the hotel and can avoid the main Shinjuku Station I'd advise it. Shinjuky Station is the busiest train station in the World and it's a zoo in the station and all around it.

The rooms were clean, comfortable and mostly adequately equipped. Small compared to the rest of our trip but this is somewhat expected with the price. The location is interesting to say the least. This hotel is a boutique hotel. Self-styled as an ""art-hotel"". There are large art installations in the very stylishly designed lobby. The room itself was also rather stylish. Desk service was fine, staff spoke enough English to figure out the particulars. Unlike some more expensive hotels, there was no bell-captain but there was an elevator which is just as good in my opinion. The rooms themselves are very clean and comfortable. Good use is made of the limited space available. That said, this was one of our smallest rooms for our entire 3 week trip. Considering we only paid about 6800 yen each ($68 AUD~), we cannot really complain but it did feel a tad cramped. Dealing with large (30kg+) suitcases required some creativity. Otherwise, absolutely impeccable rooms with good views. The location may pose a challenge to certain travelers. It is located in a particular area of Shinjuku. Most of the neighboring buildings were ""love hotels"", host clubs or ""massage"" centres. I never felt unsafe. Australia is a very safe country but Japan is even safer still. The street feels a tad seedy but i see it as adding character rather than being a threat. By in large, it just feels like a neon bathed futuristic city. It really is like the Tokyo imagined in movies and the popular imagination, bathed in a neon glow along with many small bars, ""hotels"" and fashionable people. I quite enjoyed it's character but it is not for everyone. I usually give reviews in terms of the price paid. Considering what it cost, it is a very good hotel. I love the concept behind it. The room, even given the price, was a bit on the small side but it is one of our least expensive stays.

The separate shower had two heads (dreamy), and of course the toilet was fully equipped with all of the luxurious settings you could ever ask for.The bed was very comfortable, the room had a tiny closet with Shiseido clothing freshener (so tempted to accidentally pack it), and a couch with a coffee table.

Be careful also if you need a cab to get anywhere in a timely fashion (cabs don't pass by the hotel).

Go ahead and get the breakfast-included rate. The breakfast is really good value, and consists of a full buffet with Asian and Western offerings. Shinjuku is nothing like Shibuya, and so breakfast offerings are somewhat limited. Thus, a hearty breakfast that's good value can't be a bad decision. This hotel is really better suited toward solo/couple travelers. Shinjuku is not a fun area for kids to explore - it's got some gritty parts (gritty for Japan, FYI, which is nothing).

No room service after 10pm, so no drinks to the room, and a very limited menu earlier in the day too. Only two illy coffee pods to go with the machine, and the cafe didn't open until ten in the morning.

Location is key, and Granbell was close to lots of late night or 24/7 restaurants (nice when arriving late at night and hungry!) and convenience stores. Yes, it is in the middle of a cluster of love hotels in the red light district. Some of the neighbouring hotels look cheesy, but I never felt unsafe, even as a woman walking around alone after dark on a couple occasions. It was also surprisingly quiet, because it is on a side street. I slept really well each night! The walk to the main Shinjuku station is 10-15 mins. and there is a pleasant, tree-lined path just west of the hotel. I found it much more enjoyable to take the path vs. the crowded main roads. The hotel is also close to Higashi-Shinjuku station, a smaller station with access to less lines. Finally, the hotel borders the North Shinjuku area which is the Korean part of the city. Check it out if you're looking for some Korean food or saunas. The hotel itself is very modern and clean. The design is really nice and the lobby always smelled amazing! The lounge has a nice patio. In terms of service, everything was smooth and I have nothing to complain about. The standard rooms are tiny. It's pretty much the queen bed and then a desk and chair. There was very little storage, so I kind of lived out of my suitcase. I would recommend they have more hooks to hang things on the wall. There were just a few hangers on a bar to put your jacket and one or two other items. Still, they make efficient use of the small space. There is a bar fridge, which was helpful since we got a plan where breakfast was not included. So instead, we would go to the 7-11 and buy onigiri, juice, and yogurt and eat that for breakfast! There are nice details: the mirror is heated so it never fogs up, really nice bath products, comfy PJ's and slippers. A solid option for those who want to be close to shopping (Shinjuku station area has everything - Isetan, Takashimaya, Muji, Uniqlo, Marui etc.) and be able to access subway lines that go everywhere. Shinjuku station is the busiest station in the city -- you can go pretty much anywhere in less than 40 mins. Shinjuku is also a good choice because there is a lot of nightlife, and you can just walk back to the hotel afterwards (an important consideration as taxis are really expensive and the subway stops running around ~12am).","Toronto, Canada","TO-psych</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",52,4.0

The huge shower was really nice and I found myself having baths most night in the large tub ! A good selection of channels on the tv, a comfy bed and good air conditioning. The breakfast on level 12 was pretty good, with a selection of Western and Japanese foods (we also had dinner in the restaurant one night, also good !). We also really enjoyed the roof top bar and occasionally went into the club lounge for a drink and some nibbles before bed. The staff were very friendly and had great English.

In fact we were already checked out with our bags in the lobby and off for our final day of sightseeing when we learned about our ""bonus Tokyo round"". We called the Granbell and they organised for us to check back in to the same class of room for an additional couple of nights. First up, finding the hotel really wasn't that difficult. Maybe I was over prepared after reading lots of reviews prior to arriving but in the end, I was completely surprised at how easy it was to find. My tip - DON'T alight at Shinjuku station. The trek from there with luggage would be pretty horrible. Instead change at Shinjuku station to the subway line and travel to Higashi-Shinjuku station. It is literally 2-3 mins walk once you get to street level. For the life of me I cannot remember the exit number that puts you at the best spot but there are maps in the stations that help orient you towards where you need to go. In fact, on Google maps the hotel appears as a little wedge so once you remember that, look for the ""wedge"" on any map and you've got it! Too easy. As I did with all our hotels in Japan, I actually saved the coordinates in Google maps on my phone so wherever we ended up it was a simple ""get directions to hotel"". Highly recommend this approach. Anyway, we had spent a few days at Tokyo Disneyland Resort so were travelling from the other side of the city. We ended up catching the subway from Tokyo Station and it was all very straight forward. We arrived at the hotel in late afternoon and from Higashi-Shinjuku station we exited at street level, took two left turns and from the lane it was pretty easy to spot the hotel. Super simple. The lobby was pretty busy and lots of luggage around. We were promptly served and the staff were lovely. We booked a Superior Designer Double on the 16th floor. The elevators were really efficient and there is a bank of vending machines just before them in the lobby stocking soups, ice creams, soda and alcohol. The room was incredible. Super stylish and clean with a great layout. Even with two bags there was plenty of space to move around. The view was amazing- floor to ceiling windows along the entire length of the room. In room amenities were fantastic - bath salts, Shiseido and Paul Stuart toiletries were restocked daily, complementary water, soda, iced tea and water also restocked daily, slippers and robes, bluetooth speaker for playing our tunes. Thick curtains to shut out the city light at night, great air conditioning and what was my favourite bed during our time in Japan. The bathroom had a deep soaking tub and rain shower. A few floors down was the club lounge - we only visited this once - it was stoked with complimentary tea, coffee, drinks and snacks for guests staying on the upper floors. Location is great - actually the first night we stumbled onto the Robot Restaurant - wow - what a baptism of sensory overload! Be warned - once the show is over you exit into the heart of the red light area - and as two guys we were targeted by some, shall we say, persistent chaps who tried to offer us all manner of things to the point that we had to duck into a Don Quixote to get away from them. Turns out these guys are on most corners around the area and after a second encounter on the way home we managed to find some quieter routes back to the hotel every other night. Never felt threatened - just found them annoying and was surprised I didn't read about them in other reviews before we arrived. But back to location - about 15 mins walk down to the main action in Shinjuku with all of the shops etc. We used the subway near the hotel to get around the city easily - Shibuya, Harajuku, Roppongi, Nakano, Akihabara and all the way out to Tokyo Skytree and Sensoji Temple. If you have the time, take a trip down to Hakone - it's incredibly beautiful. We took the Romance Car from Shinjuku station. We had drinks and some snacks at the rooftop bar one evening - great view and vibe up there. Perfect for kicking off your night. Breakfast was included, and we tried it once but it wasn't really appealing to me. I think my only gripe with the Granbell would actually be that there is only one dryer and when we stayed there that thing was in high rotation. I ended up setting my alarm for 5am to actually try and get to use it - luckily a guy had just finished drying his stuff at that hour so I managed to get my stuff in to dry. So if management are reading this, maybe a couple more dryers and washing machines. When all is said and done, would I stay here again? Absolutely. The Granbell was boutique brilliance.","Sydney, Australia","ccoward</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",100,4.0

Yes it's not as large as American standards, but it was perfectly functional and they had thought of absolutely everything.

The bed was very comfortable and the room had great climate control.I ate at the restaurant the first night and the views are breathtaking. The food wasn't bad at all, but nothing earth shattering.

Our hotel room was very clean and comfortable, the view (or lack of) was a disappointment (we overlooked air conditioning and fire exit stairs).

The hotel is brand new, the rooms are great but a little small (but that's not unusual in Tokyo), you get everything you need in the room and irons/trouser press etc are available to collect. The staff all said hi to you and despite their levels of English always did their best even if it means getting someone who can fully understand you. It's well located near the shopping area in shinjuku, the station and for those that swing the other way 2chome is walking distance as well. If you need the metro there is higashi-shinjuku one Road up from the hotel as well, although taking the 10/15 min walk to the main station will yield better connections. CONS: I didn't mark the hotel down for this but, the hotel is located almost directly inside Kabukicho which is the famous red light district. While perfectly safe to walk around and at no time felt uneasy, being hassled by the Nigerians to come to their bars all the time was a little annoying. If you are visiting Tokyo, don't go into any bars that the Nigerians try to get you in. However, you are able to completely bypass this area by taking a couple of mins to walk around via the main road and walking to the hotel from the other side. It's still family suitable and inside kabukicho there are still a couple of great tourist sights including the famous robot Restaurant, all that no more than 5 mins walk from this hotel. All in all. Great location, great rooms, staff and decent value for money. PS - economy doubles have little to no storage for clothes.

The # 1 reason? The staff. They replied to my email enquires in english in a timely manner including helping me reserve tickets to events I wanted to attend prior to my arrival and with shipping luggage to their location when I didn't want to carry all the gifts I bought in Kyoto on my adventures in Wakayama Prefecture. It was a great help to have someone at the hotel advise me through email on how to do this. Once at the hotel the staff continued to provide the best of service. On the first night I ate in the hotel restaurant and even though it was about 10pm the waitstaff was very friendly, described the meals to me in english and as a guest I got 30% off the bill which made the dinner very reasonable. After I went up to the terrace bar and had a drink. A fantastic view was at hand! I really want to thank the staff for assisting me in such a friendly and professional way throughout my visit.As for my room - as it was the last days of my trip I did upgrade to a queen size bed. AI splurge indeed and this was my most expensive stay in Japan, but even so, compared to prices I have paid in NYC it was very reasonable for me (and if traveling with a partner even a better deal. My cost was $120 USD a night plus tax. The room was typical for Tokyo - not spacious but it was well appointed, modern, had a view, (higher up the better) was clean (like new) had a hugh TV, a unit to plug my iPod into (or iPhone) to listen to some of my own music, a full bath/shower in the bathroom, coffee, tea etc in the room.The hotel is very clean, nice design, there are vending machines for food and drink, ice machine, a coin laundry and a cleaning service. Besides the restaurant there is also a small coffee place in the lobby. You can also rent bicycles from the Hotel.The hotel is in a great location to get out and see the sites, and even in Shinjuku's red-light district I felt safe. My one complaint is that it is hard to find the first time - you see Tokyo is a place all about getting lost. Many streets have no names and their address system is very different. Even the local tourist info place at Shinjuku Station did not know how to direct me properly, although they did give me a great map of the area, (so I advise stopping in to get that on your way to find the hotel). I would recommend that the hotel put a ""walking"" street map on their website, you cannot just follow the written directions once you get to Shinjuku. Fortunately people in Japan are friendly and want to help. It took asking three locals, but finally a nice young lady actually walked me to the hotel (it still took two wrong turns!) I advise you to not hold this against the hotel because it is actually the norm! Instead, know that getting lost can happen and be prepared. Or be willing on the first time to have a cab take you.Finally, I took the Narita Bus Shuttle form Shinjuku station to the airport - once again, the hotel staff helped book this for me, and I did the final treat of having them get me a cab from the hotel to the bus station at Shinjuku station (which was $13.50 USD) - It was raining, I had all those gifts plus some more I bought in Tokyo and I still had some yen to spend…. so why not. The bus took 1 hour and was a smooth and comfortable ride.I would recommend this hotel to anyone.","Boston, Massachusetts","solo_alien_traveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",9,5.0

Especially the bathroom with its completely automatic toilet was totally awesome, giving you a fair impression of Japan's technological side. The view from our room was really good, even better sights can be enjoyed on the terrace on top of the building.

In the middle of the dodgy area of Shinjuku, surrounded by love hotels and massage parlours, it gives the place a lot of character.

The japanese lady whom spoke basic english still managed to give us valuable info on how to get to Disneyland and also to Tsujiki fish market. Room we got was on the 18th floor and the view is still spectacular. Maybe perhaps it was my first time in Shinjuku, but the clear dark blue skies and neon glowing lights really made a nice photo from the room. The bar in house was a lil bit disappointing in choices of drinks, but the local beer was a good try and very refreshing. What is worth heading to the bar is again the view of Shinjuku city and its nice cool breeze outside. Good to have a nice lil chat with your partner or just to unwind and play Clash of Clans, which I seem to notice tables around us were doing. haha. The italian french restaurant on the other hand wasn't bad and it wasn't that good either. The set of pizza, steak, ceaser salad and spaghetti was priced reasonably and feeds two people without a problem. On the side note, i'd still prefer to recommend people to try the local restaurants around the corner [about 5-10mins walking distance] as they are tasty and much much cheaper. Oh, again, Tsujiki Market is definitely worth going for the fresh sushi/sashimi/etc and it is really out of this world. All restaurant closes by 230pm and expect to que in line for about 15mins waiting time.Long story short, is this hotel worth staying?

I had originally booked to stay a total of 3 nights in an economy double and ended up extending my stay to five nights.Location- It’s in the northern park of Shinjuku. There are many Japanese love hotels in the surrounding streets and its nearest main road is the hub of the red light district. Please don’t let that turn you off this hotel. I’m a female traveller in her 20s who was travelling alone, so safety is my first priority. The red light district is timid. I walked down the main street late at night (some nights well past midnight) in a pair of short-shorts, and I did NOT ONCE feel threatened or unsafe. The hotel is in a quiet side street so noise isn’t a problem. There is a metro train station (Higishi Shinjuku) located on the same block- an easy 3 min walk. The room- an economy double- was perfectly adequate for a solo traveller. A basic but modern room. A large comfy double bed with a desk. It’s not a huge space but fit a large suitcase with room to spare. A small safe - big enough for an 18inch mac if in sideways, great aircon and reliable FREE wifi. The bathroom was sleek and spotless. Big bath with shower overhead, and modern toilet with a terrifying amount of buttons. The only criticism I have was that the windows don’t open, so there was no fresh air. The room was designated as non-smoking, but the smell of cigarettes still permeated the room. It was unnoticeable with the aircon on. There is only a glass window dividing the bathroom and the bedroom so there would be no privacy if there were a couple staying in the room. Also the walls are very thin meaning that noisy neighbors and cleaning staff can be heard easy. Facilities- an entire room of vending machines, a great coin laundry (Y200 for a load), bicycles to rent (Y2000 a day) and a laptop with printer in the foyer. Also the FOH sell stamps- which is useful to know as I spent hours looking for a post office. Staff- very helpful. Most spoke English very well.Food- I ate breakfast once and was pretty disappointed. I ended up having a Japanese breakfast, as the western style menu was pretty lackluster. The eggs were soupy, the bacon too sweet, only tiny rolls, no fruit. The Japanese breakfast was fine. I also had a coffee every morning in the reception area (y450). The coffee was hit and miss, sometimes excellent and other times undrinkable. The rooftop bar is not to be missed. It was a beautiful view over Shinjuku, which is especially stunning at night. I had a cocktail there; it wasn’t great, stick to beer. The hotel does have some teething problems but these issues are all minor details. I would happily stay there again and plan to do so later this month. For the price it’s an excellent place to stay.","Melbourne, Australia","JennFlo123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",43,4.0

But pet hate of mine are those clingy shower curtains and stepping over high bathtubs, and slippery when wet floors.

The rooftop bar was a great place to relax after a busy day, with terrific views and a nice selection of cocktails. Although we wouldn't recommend the restaurant for dinner (but I do love Italian food and can be a bit fussy with it - this was too oily and too sweet), there was a great selection of traditional and western breakfast choices. The bed was super comfortable and having a bath with one of many selections of bath salts while looking out on the city skyline incredible. Others have also mentioned having trouble locating the hotel - it's about a 2 minute walk from Higashi-Shinjuku station with one turn, a bit trickier from Shinjuku but only because the station itself is enormous and confusing.

It's a 20-30 minute walk from shinjuku station and there is nothing in its near vicinity.Second, the real reason to avoid this hotel is they have zero value for customer service. I requested an early checkin since I had an overnight flight and just wanted to sleep, but when I arrived they tried to charge me approx $100 for checking in at 12pm and not 3pm!!! Absolutely ridiculous a full nights pay for 3 hours! After an argument they decided to offer me early check in at 1pm so I would have to wait one hour and pay $40. At that point I just said cancel the reservation and went to the nearby best western which is in a better location for the same price and they let me check in right away.Avoid this hotel, this type of service is unacceptable for a ""4 star"" hotel. They even tried convincing me other hotels won't let me check in at 12 if I left. I understand if rooms are occupied and must be cleaned but simply trying to bargain with me for extra cash to get into an already empty room is ludicrous for a hotel that is rated 4 stars, now I know why it's only $100 a night.","New York City, New York","Ash K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",23,1.0

It is a nice new hotel, but it is near the fringe of the red light district so if you are travelling with kids, may be best to avoid walking to or from the hotel, catch a taxi instead. We booked two rooms for our family of four, and despite being asked to have the rooms allocated together, this was not done so we had to sort it out at check-in time and we had to upgrade one of the rooms but they offered it to us at a discounted price. I was not able to get a response by email before our trip to confirm the room allocation, despite numerous attempts - their command of English is still quite poor but they were willing to help and accommodate our needs after our arrival. The hotel amenity kits were really good, but luggage space is lacking - and we booked into the Deluxe Suites which had their own Club Lounge and check-in/out facilities. The Club Lounge is lacking somewhat in food and drink variety and ambience. It is quite small but is better than sitting in the foyer. The location is a bit of a walk (at least a 15 minute brisk walk) from the main JR station, (closer to other non JR stations) and you will pass the red light areas, it's tucked in the back streets and we were pre-warned that taxis may find it hard to locate, so be prepared with the Japanese address when you hop into a taxi so they know where to take you.

You can get better located hotels for a lower cost elsewhere in Shinjuku.Expanded:We stayed in a total of 5 hotels in Japan (2 in Shinjuku - the other being the Century Southern Tower), and anyone who says this hotel is well located is quite wrong - it's about 20mins walk from Shinjuku station which if you have any intention of travelling around Tokyo, you want to be near.The actual facilities in the hotel are reasonable - the room was the smallest we received in Japan (which was surprising since it was the most expensive hotel we stayed in), but had all the mod cons. The air-con unit decided to switch itself off after 3 hours which was annoying in the warm nights, and with the room being so small it got very stuffy leading to a poor nights sleep on all of the four nights we were there.The biggest problem however was the service. Unlike most hotels - payment was requested up front rather than at checkout, which I believe gave them no reason to provide good service. We paid for the breakfast (which was sub-par compared to other breakfasts we had in Japan), but on the last morning had to check out at 6.45 to make our flight. Breakfast started at 7am. We asked if we could have an early breakfast and they said a flat no. This is fair enough - albeit I have always had some effort made to accommodate this request in the past. However, we decided to head up and see if there were at least some croissants laid out (which they had every morning) which we could grab before we left. As suspected, there were. But we were not allowed to take them (even though we had already paid). I planned to complain about this on checkout - but we didn't even receive the standard ""was everything okay with your stay question"".","London, United Kingdom","vaderag</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",26,3.0

It took about 1hr 15mins before we finally reached the hotel, and that was with 3 changes of trains - lugging our baggage up and down flights of stairs at the stations. When we finally reached the hotel at about 9am, they told us that we could only check in at 3pm. Exhausted, we left our luggage with them and sat down on their comfy chairs in the lobby. The lobby is welcoming and had plenty of seats, you can tell that the hotel is very new. We were spent from the overnight flight and the tiring train transfer, and promptly dozed off on the seats. Nobody came to chase us for that one hour, and that was when I decided to try my luck for an early check-in. The staff was quick to tell me the rates for an early check-in at 12pm and I declined. SGD250/night for a double deluxe room and no early check-in? Ah well.Anyway, after that power nap we decided to explore the area around us on foot. Seemed like a pretty quiet neighbourhood and it was a comfortable walk to Isetan and Takashimaya Times Square - weather was lovely! Do take note however that the nearest exit from Higashi-Shinjuku has only escalators going up (stairs for going down), so if you wanna take the train to the airport, it's best if you walk further to the main exit with the elevator.Finally managed to check in at 430pm, and the room was small, which we expected! Even though we took the bigger 23sqm room, only one of us could have our luggage open all the time, my friend had to close hers whenever we wanted to walk around the room. It had a sofa where you could also place your belongings, and the TV was never switched on - they only had Japanese channels. The toilet was very white and clean, toiletries were provided and they were rather good quality too, and it had a bathtub and a separate standing shower area.The bed was pure comfort, pillows were plush and the blackout shades were such a delight! Every night was a deep and undisturbed sleep and we dragged ourselves out of bed every morning around 11am. The hotel also provides 2 sets of Japanese robes, very cute. The room was something we looked forward to coming back to every night, and it's really commendable how well the staff spoke English and assisted us whenever we had queries.At night, the surrounding area comes alive. Kabukicho is the nightlife hub of Tokyo but walking around as 2 girls, we never once got bothered by anyone. It is safe, and it is very near the Golden Gai (bars and very yummy Nagi Ramen open 24h)Going back, our flight was at night and we decided to take the airport limousine this time after struggling with our arrival leg via the train, what more with all the shopping we had already done in 6 days. However, we were unable to lug all our stuff to the train entrance with the elevator - too far and too much stuff, we decided to take our first cab ride to Shinjuku Main Station. Flag down rate is 730yen, but the metre doesn't jump for the first 2km, so it was a good call. Also, we got the reception to write down the directions/address for us to show the cab driver, easy peasy. The bus ride itself to Haneda airport took at mere 25mins (departed at 715pm).All in all, the hotel is marvelous, just wish that the location was a bit better.",Singapore,"bizarrebeings</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",76,4.0

Shinjuku was a great location too if you want to go out at night, it is a really bustling area with several 24 hour restaurants.One downside is that the hotel is quite close to Tokyo's red light district. There are several hotels by the hour (Love Hotels), prostitutes (although they aren't as obvious as in some cities) and bars apparently frequented by the Japanese mafia. We managed to get ourselves quite lost in this area at night when we were looking for the Granbell. A very kind local actually stopped and offered to walk us to our hotel and warned us that we had gone into a bad area. Although you could tell that there was something a bit seedy about the area we never really felt unsafe. I would stay at the Granbell again despite its proximity to the red light district. One tip would be to get really good directions on how to get to the hotel for when you arrive as it can be quite hard to find as it is down a bit of a side street.",Canada,"cben5</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",24,5.0

I totally support trying new foods but first thing in the morning I'm happy to remain unadventurous :)- Rooms/Hotel: very slick as it only just opened, the room was nice and immaculately clean. There is a nice rooftop bar on the 13th floor with great views (good views also from breakfast room). - Location: great once you get your bearings. We had a transfer from the airport as our flight arrived late and we were very thankful for this because we might have struggled to find the hotel in the dark. The hotel is located about a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku station. - My advice/directions would be: take the east exit from the station, turn left then cross at the pedestrian crossing. Walk through the park area (acts as a roundabout next to station) then cross the main road heading towards the ABC Mart down to the right (look for a red and yellow sign). Walk to the end of this street, you should pass a giant Citibank building on the right. When you reach the end you will be greeted by a busy street, turn right and walk along until you reach the Baskin Robbins (right hand side). Cross the busy road over to the Mister Donut on the corner. Just next to Mister Donut (on the main road) is a pathway lined with trees. Walk down the entire pathway (you will pass some public toilets and the Golden Gai lane ways). Once you reach the end of the pathway you should see a Subway Sandwich in front/a little to the right. Cross the road so Subway is behind you, head directly up the road away from Subway towards the Aramis Hotel. Continue walking up the street until you spot the Granbell hotel building (quite tall with a visible sign). Hopefully this makes it clear for you, my directions are not necessarily the best but this is how my brother and I made it to/from the hotel in the most straightforward manner.

If your spending all your time in a hotel you may as well of stayed at home. The location was great, just far enough from Shinjuku station to walk and to be nice a quite. And if your not in the mood to eat out in the hundreds of tiny restaurants in Shinjuku and surrounding neighbourhoods the restaurant was amazing as well. One of the best meal i had while in Japan. I will be returning to japan and will definitely be making this my home while away. Thank you so much Granbell Shinjuku","Perth, Australia","chrisrigonitattooer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",4,5.0

Breakfast spread was good with both Japanese & Western choices. Staff were very polite and fluent in English. Everything in the room was nice and new with well-thought designs. The breakfast restaurant has a very good view as it's on a high floor. Check-out is at 12pm, which is nice and late, especially if you have a late flight out.Bad things: I stayed in the smallest room (economy double) and it was the tiniest room I've ever stayed in of any hotel in the world (and I've stayed at a few business hotels in Japan). For 1 person, I think it'd be OK but it's tight for 2.Issue: This probably was only because we were there during a peak period (new years day) but there was a 30 minute queue to be seated for breakfast in the mornings and then another 10 minute queue for the buffet. We also had to wait 20 minutes for check-in and there was luggage all over the lobby (not enough space behind the counter), which was messy and a little unsafe since the staff couldn't watch all the luggage.Iffy things: It's on the fringe of Kabukicho, a red light district. We had no trouble and saw nothing more scandalous than the outside of love hotels but it may not be for everyone. The location is near to Higashi-Shinjuku station (2 lines) so it's a bit of a walk to get to some lines at Shinjuku Sanchome or Shinjuku station. I don't know if I'd want to attempt it with luggage.Pet peeve: I didn't like the video they kept playing in the elevator because it gave the lift the effect of flashing lights. I also didn't like that the TV would be turned on when you returned to your room showing the hotel page with annoying (to me) music. But this stuff only annoys me and not other people.","Singapore, Singapore","Kingdomnoko</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",29,4.0

The location is a bit peculiar, surrounded by love hotels and a bit in the red light district of Tokyo, so it might not be for everyone. The regular rooms are small, but apart from that the rest was great in the stay: location is perfect to get to Shinjuku metro and train lines which makes it an easy place to visit Tokyo and around it; the breakfast buffet was nice and complete with wonderful views from the top floors. A cozy bar and a terrace in the top floor as well made a perfect spot to finish the day.I will no doubt come back again here next time I am in town, rather than the more expensive hotels as the Marriott which although nice would not stay in our minds later on.","Leiden, The Netherlands","Xoselo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leiden, The Netherlands</strong>",6,4.0

Nice design touches. Very good beds. Open deck bar on a high floor offers a very nice view of the Shinjuku area. Breakfast buffet has a very decent selection, both Western and Japanese breakfast items. The rooms are tiny. Our room,definitely was not the smallest one,yet it had no closet and once the luggage was in there was practically no room to move around. Sound isolation is average and, although we stayed at a high floor we could hear partying activity on the street (the hotel is in a night entertainment/ love hotel area). We could also hear our neighbors, even as they talked on the phone. The staff attitude is great, for the most part. There were some communication issues and some staff members are slower than others (took us a long while to check in). Perhaps things get fine-tuned over time. The wi-fi quality was a major frustration, regardless of where in the hotel we tried using it. In general there was a feeling of a very well maintained student dorm, brought about by average age of the guests, the noise, tight space and a very high number of guests the hotel accommodates.","Singapore, Singapore","NY008</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",44,4.0

However, the rooms are very small, so it may feel constraining after a few days.The staff are lovely, though the level of English varies.The nearest metro station is Higashi-shinjuku, which is not the main Shinjuku station.The Shibuya branch has a better location.There is a big selection at breakfast, the quality was slightly above average, and it is much better than the breakfast at Shibuya.The wifi had a tendency to drop off. Only Japanese channels are offered, although when I stayed at a higher floor, for some reason I could tune into cable channels such as CNN and BBC. The staff said that this might be because I picked up the signal from another building.","Melbourne, Australia","chickenvspeter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",38,5.0
