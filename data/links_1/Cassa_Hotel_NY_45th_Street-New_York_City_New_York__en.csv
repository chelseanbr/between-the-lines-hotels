I have been to NYC several times and generally like to stay in the midtown area. The hotels where I usually stay were pretty pricey this time and since Cassa was in the general area and within my price range I decided to take a chance. Everything about this hotel was awesome. We arrived early and were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready! The suite was a nice size and the sofa bed was nice and comfy. We called down to the front desk a few times for odds and ends and the staff were always so accommodating and super quick. They always had a smile and a greeting for us every time they saw us. The elevators were quick and the location was perfect, within walking distance of everything. The hotel was even able to provide a car service that was much nicer than Uber or a taxi service and for the same price. Do yourself a favor a try this hotel, you won't be disappointed!","Houston, Texas","Patsy R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",46,5.0

A lovely friendly welcome on our arrival from Stephanie, Adam and Nivar. We arrived before check-in time but Stephanie sorted a room out for us (on the 22nd floor as I’d requested a higher floor).Our room was spacious for New York with a very comfy bed, coffee maker and large TV. Bathroom had a lovely waterfall shower and there was an abundance of hot water. No fridge but we didn’t need one, there was an iron and ironing board. Room also has useful usb charging sockets on the desk and by the bed - very handy. Our room was clean and a special mention to Mery for the little notes, cleaning the room and for dealing with all of our meal rubbish!Located just off 6th Avenue it’s an ideal spot if you don’t want all the noise of Times Square but it’s only 5 minutes walk away if you do. Given it’s location you don’t get the dazzling views but as the idea of being in NYC is to be out enjoying it, not in the room, that’s fine with me. There’s a Pret next door which is ideal to grab a coffee/breakfast bite and there are restaurants and a couple of bars 2 minutes further on 45th Street.They were happy to securely store our cases on our final day so we could spend a last few hours in the city enjoying ourselves.Would I stay there again - definitely.

We were able to do an early check in and got upgraded to a slightly bigger room by being an Expedia VIP holder. Parked one block away and walked 5mins to the hotel. It was really easy to find. We knew we were in the center of all the things we wanted to see/do but what we didnt realize until our 2nd day how close we really were to everything! We walked to all of our destinations (avoided taking the subway). I even had time to freshen up in the afternoon before heading to our night schedule. I also loved that they allowed us to leave our luggage after check in so we can walk to the Times Square and buy our Jollibee to bring back home to NH.

I actually booked at a different hotel, but when I talked to someone from the front desk about the parking situation, she couldn't have been nicer & welcoming of my questions. She sold me! After parking 1 street over on 46th street ($40/day for our SUV) we cut through a park area & landed right in front of the hotel. Evita & Stephanie A. were there to greet us & let us know we had been chosen as their ""Guest of the Day""!! How exciting!! We were upgraded to a Studio Suite on the 6th floor. I was a little nervous that we were so close to the elevator, but we never hear any noise from it. They also provided us with a lovely treat and wine for our anniversary. So special! The room was very clean & spacious. My only complaint on checkout was the shower. If you followed the directions on the faucet, & turned all the way to hot, it was ice cold. We found backing it up worked. There was no barrier between the glass and the tub so a ton of water spilled out onto the floor. We had to use a hand towel to try to keep most of the water in. No biggie. Hopefully it will be fixed. The heater that went off & on was a little noisy, but I quickly got used to it. And one of our neighbors decided to pump up their music at midnight, but shutting the bathroom door solved that problem. The hotel is in a great location. A block & a half from central Time Square perfect for walking. I would definitely come back to this hotel.",Maryland,"Scully1998</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maryland</strong>",11,5.0

We didn’t want to go in all day for the ball drop on New Year but obviously wanted to see it if possible. We managed to see it from 42nd st after going to a fantastic restaurant “Benjamin’s” recommended by Johnathan at the hotel he was fantastic and did all the reservation for us. All the staff were friendly and helpful but I would really say that Johnathan went that extra mile.The room was clean and a fair size for New York.

We are in three different rooms. Everything we needed. The bed is very comfortable as well, the queen and king are the same size so do not have to book the king. Cold water is available 24 hours at reception. Quiet rooms and no noise from other rooms. Always hot water in the shower. Shampoo, conditioner and body lotion are great and high quality available in the rooms. The bad things: We had to go through a room three times! The first room didn't look at all like the picture, very cramped and small so we couldn't open the shower door because it was locked in a bed. In general, a poorly designed (high-rise king room) smelled badly in a room of suffocation and dust, no bedside table as it appears on the website, and the terrible noise of the shower opening the warm water. Second night we were transferred to Queen's room, although we paid for King because there were no other rooms and we did not get a refund.And we were not compensated for a room upgrade... There was a bath in the room which is nice, the room was better organized, the problem was that in the room there was an unbearable tractor coming out of the water heating the whole building and it didn't stop, the noise was so loud that our baby couldn't sleep at night and cried a lot. In the morning, we were completely exhausted, moved us to another room of accessibility. He was on the 14th floor and we were very pleased, he looked more modern with a good smell, clean and well organized. As we expected from the beginning.Have a portable shower room that is not self-evident from America, which is great for those who come with children or just prefer. Too bad they don't have breakfast, even as small as coffee and curasson, it could add to the hotel",,516nivas,1,3.0

The bathroom door couldn’t open all the way because it would hit the left side of the bed. Yes, that small! There was no closet, just a tall box with hangars which partially blocked TV viewing from the bed. It wouldn’t stay closed so we had to use a suitcase as a barricade to keep it shut. I couldn’t hang my suit properly because the hangars weren’t high enough anyway.And next to the bed on the right, blocking one of the two windows was a crooked mirror whose only purpose seemed to be to block me from getting to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The tiny room was transformed into an obstacle course. No end table on the right side of the bed as there’s no room. While a bit hard and lumpy in spots the actual bed was decent.The bathroom brought its own drama. Sometimes hot water would come out of the cold water tap in the sink. While we could get used to that, the “bath” towels (which were really slightly larger than hand towels) were cheap skimpy and rough. No bathrobes were available. We just had to stop and laugh. The staff were kind and somewhat attentive. No complaints there. Bottom line, there must be a hundred hotels in this price range in Manhattan to try.We won’t even get into the tiny lobby with suitcases askew and the elevators which take forever to arrive or the restaurant which may, or may not be open for breakfast or lunch.....","Westlake Village, CA","mineralman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Westlake Village, CA</strong>",25,2.0

That afternoon, they moved me to a third room, but did not move any of my belongings to the third room. After waiting in my empty room for 45 minutes, they decided to move me back to the second room with no explanation for wasting my time.

To keep it short and sweet with just the major offenses, we came back from dinner after midnight and our door wouldn't open. So up and down the elevator we went as they assumed we didn't know how to open a door. Our door wouldn't open and all of our things were inside so after an hour of waiting in the dismal lobby as they tried to open our door at 1:30 am they finally said they couldn't open it and would put us in an upgraded room but it was not an upgraded room it was actually a smaller room for wheelchair bound guests and obviously was a significant downgrade from the larger room we had paid for. We had to go to Duane Reade in the middle of the night to buy a few supplies like cheap t shirts to sleep in. (They didn't seem to think being locked out of your room all night was much of an issue.)In the morning the hotel ran out of hot water while I was in the shower and then all water stopped. We had to call and go to the desk multiple times to push them to get our original room door open. It took hours and they offered us nothing. We finally got one person to say we didn't have to pay for the night we didn't have our room and the manager was obviously annoyed that the person made us this offer. Gee thanks.We decided to change hotels. The staff was disinterested and the elevator floors were very dirty. It was an all around bad experience. There are so many better hotels for the same price.

The staff was super nice and professional, no matter who was at the front desk. Even the maid who we met once was frindly and met all our wishes. Room was clean and well equipped with all the amenities you would need. Even the coffe maker with tee, coffe, decaf etc. Communication, reservation and payment was no hustle whatsoever. Shower in the room was spacious with great watter preassure. Hairdryer, iron and tv are in the room. TV has an abundance of tv channels to choose from. There is a gym in the building but we did not use it. There is a restaurant Buter in the building. Elevators are fast. Time sqare is 5 minutes away 5th awenue even closer (NBA shop and many many others). Empire state building and all others uper Manhattan attractions are in walking distance, even Central park if you are fit (30min), and there is a lot to see on the way too. Long story short...

This hotel is in a perfect location in Manhattan, very close to Times Square and a short walk to popular attractions such as the Rockefeller, Empire State building and Grand Central Terminal. It is also near many subway stations which made it very easy to travel around Manhattan. There are also a lot of restaurants and pubs around the area, big fan of the food even American Mcdonalds is better than England's.

However, the billing/customer service is very shady and I never write poor reviews about Hotels. I even do a fair amount of research to avoid bad places. Regardless, I found a good deal for this hotel as well as pretty decent reviews. The main problem behind the hotel is that these ""deals"" are not set in stone. First, they make you book online but they never charge your card in order to easily cancel you if they sell the hotel at full price. Then, they do not include many of the charges in your initial payment which highly inflates the cost when you get there. Then, they deceive you and ask for a card to cover ""for any potential charges or damages"" but this is the card that they will actually bill you with instead of the one you originally paid for. Everything is very deceitful and as a consequence they hire people in the front desk who are pretty shady characters.This isn't really a 3-star place. Its a good location, but that is it. The front desk is filled with shady characters and just poorly mannered staff. I had an issue with the billing, and was polite originally but the front desk person just started escalating in order to flare tempers. No professional approach at all, which is laughable and represents a type of mentality that truly questions how capable someone is that they cannot handle dealing with simple customer requests. Anyway, the front desk lied and said they couldn't reverse my card charges for 30 days out of pure pride because of looking ridiculous in front of other customers just by me pointing out the pointlessness of their policy (which wasn't a policy in the first place). In the future, I'd pick another hotel instead of one run out of shadiness. The location was good though, that was the big positive. And the bathrooms were pretty nice too.",,Michael T,1,1.0

Well, this was news to me! The booking was still confirmed in my Booking.com account, and I hadn't received any correspondence since I booked in February. 6 MONTHS PRIOR! I spoke to someone at Booking.com who advised me that the hotel have said the prices on Booking.com are incorrect (not sure how that works as I know the hotels have to input their own prices?) and said the hotel wouldn't honour the price shown. The service I received from the hotel's sale coordinator, Nermine, was disgusting. They kept saying that it was Booking.com who had cancelled the stay and was nothing to do with them. Not quite sure how that's true as Booking.com was showing as confirmed. They also stopped replying when I asked if they would honour the booking. The worst part about this is they would have never of told me that the booking had been cancelled until I turned up if I had not contacted them beforehand about something else. This would have left two young women stranded in New York in the middle of the night. You can see from other reviews this is a common occurrence, funnily enough it happened to my friends parents when they'd booked a cruise package which included a few nights stay at the same hotel (only found this out once it happened to me).

The room was more than adequate.

However, following a phone call to reception, a roll-away bed was brought up immediately which was fine for our son. The staff offered to move us to a bigger room the following day but we were happy to stay where we were. On our second night the AC wasn’t working, which made for an uncomfortable night. Here again, one mention to the reception staff and they arranged for the issue to be sorted out immediately. Unfortunately it was necessary for us to curtail our break because of a family matter at home - the hotel manager was most sympathetic and arranged for us to check out a day earlier than planned in our reservation, and he refunded the final night’s charge. The hotel is very well located for Times Square and Broadway etc - and also Bryant Park which is a real oasis in the heart of the city with a fantastic vibe. We loved it!

While on the plane to NYC, someone from the hotel called to tell me that if I don’t call them back, they can’t guarantee my room. Since I was on the plane, I didn’t get the message until later. Turns out that they had a bad credit card number and needed it to hold the room. Whatever... I gave them a different card which really was the same card they didn’t work. It worked when I called. I hade to deal with this in the airport when I landed with my daughter there. We got to the hotel late, around 7. When we checked in, there were three employees at the desk having a casual conversation and no other people. Nobody would even acknowledge my existence. Finally I said excuse me politely and one of them asks what they can help me with as I stood there with my luggage. I don’t know-maybe check me in??? I thought. As he is checking me in, he states that they are doing maintenance on the air but it will be back up in the next 30 minutes to an hour and that I need to be patient. I said nothing, dragged my luggage to the room, and then my daughter and I went to go find dinner as we hadn’t eaten all day. We decided to hang around Times Square and eat and got back to the hotel at 10, three hours after he claimed the ac would be working. We went to the room. NO AC. Went down and they told me to be patient. At that moment the maintenance guy was there and he said he would come to fix it. He came up and explained what to do and signs it isn’t working. He left and I gave it an hour. Still not working. Went down to get help again and the manager again tells me to be patient. I expressed that I had been and have a young kid and it is 90 in the room. The guy came back up and “fixed” it again. I waited another 30 minutes and it actually got hotter in the room. I went down again and asked if he could move us to a room he knew the AC worked. He said no, obviously because there were no rooms with working AC. I asked for my money back and he did not argue. Called several hotels and finally ended up at The Time Hotel NY. They were great and their customer service was top notch, and it was less expensive. Stay away from this hotel. I know that stuff happens and it is out of their control, but their demeanor and service from the beginning was terrible and there are many hotels where you can be treated decently. They need to fire the manager. Not for the AC, but total lack of caring about people. Also, they should have said something on the phone when they wanted my credit card, or at the very least should have said that they won’t charge me if the ac is not working or they could line up an alternative hotel. While that would be turning away a visitor, it would have made me consider staying there another time or recommending the place. I do not recommend this place. Go to The Time NY. They know how to deal with people. BTW, the room I got at that hotel had broken AC also, but they moved me into a room that worked and took one night off. It was like we were cursed but that hotel did it right. ","Phoenix, Arizona","coachj1414</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",10,1.0

The room was modern and the bathroom was updated and gorgeous. I had two windows that brought light in and made the room airy. The elevators were quick and efficient. The bed was a small double, but I was travelling solo so it worked for me. TV had cable including HBO. The shampoo and products they supplied were wonderful and the towels and linens fresh and clean. Maid came every day to clean my room. My only wish was a coffee/tea maker in the room, but there was a Pret A Manger and Starbucks close by. The front desk staff were wonderful!

The only thing that complicated things was that the bathroom can only be accessed off of the bedroom which meant our son needed to come though our room to get to the bathroom. A minor inconvenience and just a byproduct of the suite design. Not that big of a deal, but worth noting for anyone considering this type of room. Cassa is definitely our go to hotel for NYC trips. After our first stay a year ago we tried another hotel and were not nearly as happy. HighlyRecommend this hotel. Cassa is clean, safe, comfortable, has great service, and a perfect location for Times Square/ Theatre district.

He also told us the best and most affordable ways to get around NYC without spending too much money on transportation.The next day as my wife and i were heading out, he suggested my wife take a warmer jacket for the day, she told him that was the only jacket she had and he went out of his way to walk us to a clothing store nearby where my wife was able to find a jacket at a very reasonable price. And he was right, she definitely needed a warmer jacket! On another occasion, it began to rain and as we left the hotel Adam was kind enough to give us an umbrella for the day and suggested we visit all the indoor places like Museums or watch a Broadway Show since the day would be rainy and gloomy.

The hotel is in a great location and is clean. The staff are very friendly. The only problem for me is the noise from what I think is the heating system. It wakes me up each morning from 4am. It’s a very loud buzzing noise. And is on and off all morning so you cannot get back to sleep. I haven’t reported this to the reception staff as the couple who me and my husband have travelled with are staying in a different room and they have told me they are experiencing the same problem and it wakes them up too every morning. So not much point asking to move rooms if it does it everywhere else. It’s such a shame as the hotel is brilliant as far as cleanliness and location go. But for the reason of the noise and not having a very good nights sleep I would not return to this hotel.,"Leeds, United Kingdom","adsandclaire</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leeds, United Kingdom</strong>",32,3.0

One negative note was that we were celebrating a birthday, but we were disappointed that the hotel didn't acknowledge it, even though it was in the reservation notes. The room was average size for Manhatten with modern furniture.  One bedside table had easily accessible outlets (but not the other side of the bed), and unfortunately, the built-in USB didn't work. The bathroom had a fun rain-shower head with plenty of hot water. It was surprising that the room didn't include a coffee maker (one is available per request, but it wasn't clear if there was a charge for this service). Wifi was consistent but limited to two devices per room which seems inadequate considering how many people work while they travel and since there were two of us on this trip it meant we couldn't connect all our devices. Overall we had a pleasant stay and decided on this hotel because it's part of the Radisson family. One thing that's always disappointing about Radisson rewards is that they don't offer complimentary breakfast to gold elites (such as Hilton does for example).  But it's a toss-up on whether we would choose this hotel in the future over their competition.  ","Knoxville, Tennessee","chubby_wanderer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Knoxville, Tennessee</strong>",80,3.0

Even the small gestures, like opening doors and offering water, were exchanged with sincere smiles and genuine appreciation for the guests. We did not have room service, so I cannot comment on that. The room was marvellous after a long flight. Our room (510) was large, with an XXL bed and an XXL television, which meant snuggling down to watch a film at the end of busy days was a welcome treat! Our room was also very well soundproofed, we couldn't hear a peep from Times Square round the corner! We also had a safe and plenty of storage space for our bits and bobs.The bathroom was beautifully marbled with a rainfall shower, water always hot, and bath deep enough to really relax your feet and back after a long day in the city.

I was told no because they are in the room. I thought for a high end hotel they could have had extras or since people checked out they could have given me one while they clean the room and make that our room. but no. We left our bags and went on our way. When we came back our room was ready but our bags were not put in our room. I found that just a way to get a tip. I asked to bring my bags up myself but I was forced to use a bell boy. The room is very nice and comfortable. we had set the thermostat since it was set very cold. We went to eat and came back and it was still cold but it had went up a couple of degrees. So I left it and we went to bed. I woke up in the middle of the night for the thermostat to be at 63 degrees and making clicking noises. I know they would have fixed this but it was like 1 in the morning and I did not want to wake my wife so I left it.also at night I had asked them to print something for me which I was told it would be waiting for me at checkout. we checked out and I told the lady about the umbrellas where she told me well we cant give them out and about the thermostat she said well you should have told us. I was not complaining just informing her. Also in their room menu it says seasonal drinks are served in the afternoon which they did not have, Their answer for that was its not the season so I asked which season do you have the drinks they were dumbfounded. we then left the hotel and about 10 minutes later realized they did not give me my printed item so I had to go back. THe hotel is a good location and bed is comfy . Thermostat easily could have been fixed so for that I give it no problem.

Other than that I fail to see why so many guests are giving it such high marks. It is a three star hotel at best - not four, and certainly does not meet up to the description of either Virgin Holidays' website or the hotel's own website - where was my bathrobe, iPod docking station and coffee machine?!On arrival the receptionist gleefully told us that we had been upgraded.... to what?! Rooms were dark and dreary. The air conditioning / heating was so loud that we had to make a decision whether to keep it on during the night, or switch it off completely. There was no plug socket near the mirror, and while there was a safe it wasn't bolted down so you could pick it up and walk away with it!Service? What service? OK, so we did get housekeeping every day, but apart from arrival an departure, there was no service. Staff didn't even look up to say good morning, and as we left we didn't even get their full attention as they were chatting to each other.There was tea and coffee available in reception first thing (I keep saying reception, because it isn't much of a lobby) but nobody told us about breakfast being served in the adjoining restaurant. In fact, I don't believe it was.... or else it was just empty every day.And the 10th floor lounge? Virgin Holidays - the 10th floor lounge was not in use.... although it was the only accessible bathroom in the hotel after you'd checked out.Brilliant holiday in New York.

The side tables near the bed were a little run down, and the iPhone player in the room was for a much older iPhone, so it was not usable (and took up a lot of space). The only other negative is that there isn't a dresser and it was a small closet, so we weren't able to take all our clothes out of our suitcases. Overall, a good room and an excellent location within easy walking distance to Bryant Park, Radio City etc. The only downside to the location is that the traffic is very heavy in mid-town. Would definitely consider staying here again.","Scarborough, ME","ScarboroughFoodie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scarborough, ME</strong>",41,4.0

Rooms are lovely and a good size for New York but carpets and decor are looking a little tired. That’s the only negative I can think of so now for the real review:We arrived a couple of hours early expecting to have to wait around but they were waiting for us and the room was ready which allowed us to get straight out there. The sheets on the bed were pure white and soft and the bed was THE most comfortable bed I’ve slept in abroad! When I first lay on it I thought it would be too soft but it was amazingly comfortable. The bathroom was a good size with lovely full size toiletries and the shower was AMAZING!!!! Perfect for after you’ve been out all day. The one thing that stands out in this hotel is the staff. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Doorman always asked if you needed help and the reception staff were always helpful when we asked questions. Day of departure José arranged all of our transport for us constantly calling the company to check eta. He really couldn’t do enough to help us he was brilliant - even though he couldn’t understand my accent he is a credit to the hotel! Jonathan was also really friendly and helpful and kept checking on us while we were waiting for our pick up. Unfortunately I didn’t get the doorman’s name but when our shuttle bus couldn’t get to the hotel due to traffic he picked up both our cases and said come on let’s go I’ll take you to where your shuttle is parked .... no hesitation ... brilliant customer service! The staff here make this hotel worth going to - they’re all awesome! Would I stay here again? Most definitely! ,,Kcee88,55,5.0

The Uber ride was $38 from LaGuardia Airport. At check in we were told that we had been upgraded. But after entering the room...I could not tell what the upgrade was. It had one king bed as we paid for, a view of a water tower through our dirty window(dirt on outside only), and probably the tiniest room we've ever stayed in. No big deal though, everything in the room seemed clean. And that's all we really care about. Perhaps the desk clerk shouldn't mention getting free upgrades, because all it did was gave us false hope. The hotel seems to be pretty centrally located next to Times Square, Rockefeller, etc. If you're planning to spend any time at all in your room, you may want to opt for a larger room elsewhere. But if you're like us, and just want a clean room to sleep in at night, then this place works.","Whitesville, Kentucky","Travis928</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Whitesville, Kentucky</strong>",40,4.0

After running some errands and being out for much of the 2nd day I came back to find my room had been serviced. I was a bit upset, mainly because I don't pick all my personal items up and I just wasn't anticipating it. I told them at the front desk and they put a note on my room/account to not have it serviced the remainder of the stay.

It is truly only a couple of minutes walk from Times Square with relatively easy access to subways.

The only saving grace was the manager Omar who ultimately took pity on me and found me another room in a quiet hotel in the area for a similar price at 1 am, but the whole thing was ridiculous and clearly just part of some broader scam where the hotel feels like it can pick and choose which contracts it wants to honour.

Upon checking into the room, we were met with a kind of musty smell and the carpet felt sticky/damp. One of the built in headboard lamps was missing. No in-room coffee so you have to go down to the lobby which is a pain if you're on an upper floor. The hotel's associated restaurant has their smoking area 10 feet from the lobby door so you're greeted by cigarette smoke anytime you enter the building and the lobby reeks of stale cigarettes.

I called the front desk and they send in a technician who tried to work on the unit in our room but said that it needs to be done from the outside. Again no issues. One hour passes and he is still working. Okay, things take time. It is over 85 degrees in the room by now. Finally at around 9.30 PM I go downstairs to see what is happening and the manager named Omar says that they are still working on it and that I need to wait. Finally at 10.15 after repeatedly trying to get answers ( all this while he behaved as if nothing was wrong) he tells me that yeah the AC is not going to work so we ll have to do with fans which he will provide. I told him that the room is full of the gaseous smell from the AC he said that he can give us an exhaust fan for circulation.I asked him to shift us somewhere else as we had a long 24 hour international flight the very next morning but he denied saying no rooms were available . I then asked him to shift us to a different hotel for the night as it is impossible to sleep in that room. And he ignored and left.Fuming, we finally decided at 11.00 to pack our bags and leave. Only after I had to put my foot down and have the front desk call him to the lobby ( he refused to come downstairs and wanted to talk on the phone) he said that he managed to get us a room at a nearby 3 star hotel.Waiting for him with 5 large bags, he explains us the way to the new hotel from the lobby and leaves.

We did a late check-in @ 8:30 pm and it was a breeze. Were given 2 rooms on the same floor and the bell boy assisted us with our luggage (tipped him of course). The front desk also gave me a coupon for parking on the adjacent street for 50$ a night, without the coupon it’s 75$ a night. After checking in to our rooms and the luggage dropped off, we turned on the AC in both the rooms, freshened up and went out for dinner thinking by the time we get back to the room it would cool down. Note, the 3 days we stayed in New York, there was a heat wave and record temperatures. After we came back from dinner, one of the rooms was still hot and the AC doesn’t seem to be working. Tried to call the front desk and the phone didn’t work. So, I went down and complained to the girl at the front desk about the AC and the phone not working. She sent a maintenance guy right away to look at it. He worked on the AC for 10/15 minutes, did a reset and the AC started to blow cold air. He couldn’t fix the phone as he said the phone in this and another room has been down for a while (from the day before) and they’ve already put a work order for it. Frustrated on being given a room that has no AC and phone, I told him that I am not worried about the phone not working as long as the AC works to which he said, “he fixed the AC and it will take some time for the room to cool down”. Within 5 mins after the maintenance guy left, the AC stopped blowing cold air. I went downstairs again to the front desk and politely requested the girl to move us to another room as the AC doesn’t work in the room and it’s very hot (81F, see pic) and I can’t keep going up and down as it’s already 11:30 PM at night. The girl understood my frustration, acted very professional and called her manager Omar, who came to the front desk after 5 mins. This is when things got really ugly. I told Omar what the problem is and that we wanted another room as it is 81F in the room, to which he casually said, they are sold out for the night. I asked him what my options are, as my elderly parents cannot sleep in that hot room, to which he said, he would have a “Dyson” fan (stressed on the make as he said Dyson fan 2-3 times) put in the room that will cool down the entire room. I said I am aware of what a Dyson fan is and it is not the same as AC, because if it is, no one would spend money on getting AC and instead use a “Dyson” fan. Over the course of this conversation I also said that I am not paying full room rate if the only option is to use a fan to which he said, “I haven’t charged your card yet and you are more than welcome to leave if you want to”. When I heard it, I lost my patience and told him that it was very unprofessional on his part to say something like that and he doesn’t own the property. I insisted on talking to his manager. He gave his managers card and said the manager is out over the weekend and the only person I have to deal at this time is, him. He acted like he was on a power trip. I took his managers card and told him that this is absolutely the worst customer service that I’ve ever seen from a manager and I can’t believe that his management has left the property to be run by such an incompetent person. Coming into his senses and realizing what he said ""asking the hotel guests to leave at midnight and find another hotel"" was absolutely wrong, he toned down a bit and said he will work it out with me the next day as he has no information on my booking. I asked him to pull up my booking information on the computer in the front desk and he came up with the dumbest excuse or should I say, another lie that his IT team has not fixed his credentials yet for him to be able to log on to the front desk computer and he has to go downstairs somewhere for that. Thinking in my mind I’ve had enough of this person I just asked the girl to put the fan (see pics) in the room and I’ll deal with this situation the next day. The next morning, I got a call from a gentleman named Patrick who was very polite and professional in the way he spoke. He told me that he came to know about the problem I had the night before and has called me to set things straight. He upgraded us to suites for the rest of the stay and also gave us a free breakfast voucher for a day. I made it clear to Patrick that it’s not about free upgrades and vouchers, it comes down to treating your guests in a professional way. Being in service industry, you should earn our business and not make us a hostage to the situation and ask your guest to leave at midnight. He acknowledged that it was very wrong on their part to say something like that and apologized on Omar's behalf. A true professional. I would have given this hotel a one star rating if not for Patrick. Coming to the property it is centrally located and I would recommend it and will give 4 stars (one star removed because of the robe with hole, see pic), as long as you don’t have to deal with people like Omar.","San Jose, California","kantheti</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",13,4.0

Hotel is in an excellent position but in both our rooms there was a problem with the air conditioning which we reported numerous times. On last day one of our bags went missing for 25 minutes! There is no policy or procedure in place to deal with missing bags. Eventually it was found but we nearly missed our airport shuttle. The televisions in the rooms are brilliant and it is great as there is a small fridge that can be used. Bottled water though is $4 for a small bottle is purchased from hotel so best to get own. The hotel is very quiet which is lovely but the air conditioning is a problem. When on it is very very noisy but we had quiet a few nights where it was on and noisy but not working. Room was about 80 degrees (the thermostat in the room tells you this) which made it hard to sleep. A simple remedy would be to have some dyson fans available for hot periods when air conditioning seems over whelmed! I would have said that I would return as the hotel is in a great position. But when my bag went missing at the last minute the way it was dealt with was terrible. I was advised all bags etc are under CCTV so I suggested we watch this to see where it was put, but only the manager can, and it was his day off! Surely the duty manager should be able to do this! It certainly would have helped me find my bag more quickly, without all the stress I went through. Maybe I was unlucky but I also got bitten by something every night so came home with 7 or 8 bites!

It was a great deal. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hotel room. It was super clean and had everything we needed. We stayed in the standard room, it wasn’t big but it was definitely enough for NY. You should spend your time on the streets not in the hotel room. That being said the standard bed is smaller than a queen but not as small as a double. It is kind of in between. We are pretty average size people so it was just fine for us. We asked for a complimentary upgrade but it wasn’t granted. No worries. Checkin: it wasn’t fast by any means the lobby is small and doesn’t offer anything in the way of a relaxing seating area. There is coffee and water available but that is it. There also isn’t a dedicated concierge. This is something we really missed. We had been to NY before but it is always nice to ask questions. Yes you could ask the clerks but they were always helping checkins Staff: the staff was polite, both the clerks and the maintenance staff. Everyone said hello and wished us a good day. Elevators: previous posts complained about the elevators but we didn’t have any problems. We would leave in the morning come back in the afternoon and then leave again for the night and not once were the elevators slow or not working. Area: the hotel is in a great area of New York. You will be in close walking distance from NBC studios and the Today show. You are a few blocks from Time Square, Central Park and 5th Ave. The subway is on 42nd street which opens up Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens to you. Eats: on 46th street just through the park is 2 Bros Pizza. The absolute best pizza in NY. 2 cheese slices and pop $1.99. Breakfast check out Pick a Bagel on 8th and 53rd.

The negatives are that the Standard and Queen bedrooms are on the lower floors with no views. They are small and dark, but if like us you aren’t spending much time in the room, not a major problem. What is a problem, is that there is no space to even hang a shirt properly in the tiny cupboard provided as a closet. Not ideal, but I would still recommend this hotel for anyone staying in NYC, but to choose a King bedroom on the higher floors, which we where informed by staff, have bigger rooms and much more closet space. Also on checking out, the hotel receptionist kindly offered to arrange our a private car to JFK with a company with which they have an agreement. He said it would be a flat fee of $75 payable to the driver, which included Toll Fees and Tip. Unfortunately on arrival at JFK, the driver said it would be $75 PLUS $9.50 Toll Charges.

We will be coming in on Saturday 5/26 and staying two nights. I first spoke with Edlira Kuka the Sales Coordinator and explained that we were coming in and that my son has never been to NYC and that I wanted to request a room on the highest floor possible. Edlira carefully explained all of my options with the utmost professional decorum without all of the pushy up-selling. I have worked in this industry for several years and Edlira has certainly checked off all of the boxes for GREAT customer care. A few days later I again reached out to Edlira regarding the best parking options. Again she explained to me that they do not have parking there but they do have a partnership with a garage around the corner. Turns out the rates were much cheaper than I anticipated for NYC!! We are very much looking forward to this getaway and I couldn't be happier with the professionalism exhibited thus far by Cassa Hotel.

They gave us advise on places to eat, even where to buy extra luggage on our check out day due to our over shopping.

Me, funny enough, I have none. The hotel fulfilled its duty to provide me with an excellent place to sleep. My room was, in my view, rather larger for NYC (1402). Yes, the bed was only a full size, but I was more than comfortable. The bathroom was large and I liked that the glass shower wall really kept the water in and not on the bathroom floor. It would have been nice had the maid left my towel on the rack as I asked, but all was fresh.I do think the closet is rather small, and maybe an option would be for the hotel to add a shelf into the old mini-bar space at the desk, this would give much needed folded clothing space.All in all, I really like this hotel, and most likely will be with them in September when I return for work.

The room was big compared to other New York hotels and at a better price. The Shower was amazing! Hot and never wanted to get out once you was in. It is located 2 blocks from times square, 20 second walk down the street you will find “Cafe Manhattan” this is a store but also does great breakfasts to order. You can dine in or take to go, Which we found convenient as ours days are packed with sightseeing. Also good to fill the fridge in your room with drinks for throughout the night or in the morning. We was i room 1602 right outside the lift and we was not disturbed by people using it. we had a view of other building at the back of the hotel which we didnt not mind as we was never in it much and got no street noise of a morning. Great hotel and will be staying here again if returning to New York. P.S the Subway is the quickest way to travel around New York. Do not get the hop on hop off bus, i would advise getting a rail card. Its much faster as the hop on hop off is always stuck in traffic or stopping to pick people up.

Hotel - Its a small hotel with two fast elevators. I can't begin to say what a difference that makes to your overall experience. We frequent NYC and waiting a long time for the hotel elevators is just a fact of life -- except at this gem of a hotel. None of our vacation time was wasted waiting for the elevators! Room was slightly larger than NYC average, beautifully laid out, and exquisitely clean. Loved the gorgeous rain shower. Rooms were absolutely silent - no street noise, no noise from other rooms. There wasn't a great view from our 5th floor window (just another building) but it wasn't at all a bad view either. With arthritis, comfy beds are a must and this was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept on. Staff - The staff is incredibly warm, professional, and eager to help. They went above and beyond, one and all. Every time I walked through the doors of the hotel I would think, ""I'm so glad we gave this place a try!"". Its small so there chances of checking in early are a little low and indeed, we had to wait until after 3 to check in. That said, they happily stored our luggage and made sure we had access to very large bathrooms to change clothes before heading out on the town. The hotel doors don't lock at night (at least not before 11 pm) and you don''t need a key card to use the elevators. That said, I always felt safe with multiple staff at the doors. Dining - There is a Starbucks and a Pret A Manger on the block if you want a familiar something for breakfast. If you want to be a bit more adventurous, there is a restaurant for every taste and every budget within a 5 minute walk. There is no room service. I really hope to make this our go-to NYC hotel.

There was no attempt made to ready the room while we waited. I find it hard to believe that not one room could be ready a little earlier when, miraculously, all of them are ready at the same time. That was pretty disappointing. There didn't seem to be much of an attempt to get us in as soon as possible. So far, not impressed with the customer service or the lobby. Time will tell. Well, after 3 nights at the hotel, my opinion of the staff did not change, and there was nowhere in the hotel to relax outside the room. The lobby was dreary and drafty and not at all welcoming. The room however, was lovely. Clean, updated and very nice shower and bathroom. It was disappointing that there are no drawers for your clothes, just a few hangers and very small cubby holes. The rooms were quiet and the elevators were fast. Overall, it's a good place for cleanliness and quiet but it's not a warm or welcoming facility.

Every aspect of our stay was wonderful, Thank you! We especially would like to share how pleasant Anthony and Lytesha were at the complementary breakfast buffet. They both need to be commended for their hard work and pleasant attitude! When so many guests wait until the last minute to come to the buffet and literally overwhelming the 1-2 staff members hustling to keep everything full and fresh it was disappointing to see a male supervisor openly speaking to them in-front of guests (ourselves), that another guest complained who arrived after the end time. Anthony and Lyteshia you are doing an amazing job and would hire you in a heart-beat to work in our hotel! Don't let those delinquent guests or in-fact your grumpy supervisor ruin your pleasant attitude and dedication to your job! Thank you! To the grumpy supervisor... you should lead by example, not by harsh criticism when you could have easily seen how many guests arrived late if you had been there to support your team at such a critical time instead of publicly reprimanding them in front of guests. I hope you re-evaluate your approach with these words of constructive criticism. I only wish I knew your name to address you directly. Felix the Bellman is also to be commended as he greeted our family immediately upon parking to unload our luggage with a bell cart. He patiently loaded up our numerous bags and delivered them to our room. Each time we traversed the lobby, Felix was there with a smile and a fresh apple to take as a snack. Thank you!Michael at the front desk was very courteous to our needs and promptly saw to our special request needed in our room without delay and also greeted us each time we came through the lobby. Thank you!The ladies at the front desk when we checked out, Ashely and Diana saw to it that we had some cool bottles of water and ice to fill our cooler for the road trip home. Thank you!The maids rotated and I apologize I did not get your names, but thank you for making sure that our room needs were met with as many fresh towels and supplies as needed.We found the hotel to be very clean and well designed. Despite our room facing a construction project, the room was completely silent from the sounds of the city with the windows closed. The location is perfect to walk to many of the locations we were headed to, including Time Square, Hells Kitchen, The Garment District and even public transportation station just a block away with indoor quick food dining.

Same goes for the Manhattan hotel shuttle service. Luckily I had the address handy or who knows where I might've wound up.Very pleasant front desk staff in the minuscule lobby offered to take care of multiple things but didn't do so in an overly organized manner if at all. I was informed that a coffee machine could be had in my room on request, it was never delivered.Same went for my transport back to the airport: a written note was made but no information was left in the system. Luckily a van arrived when I needed it, but without confirmation and driving through parts of Queens that weren't fantastic, I wasn't exactly impressed.As mentioned by others, the layout of the room wasn't phenomenal. A desk with a single uncomfortable chair was right in front of the TV. The bed is the only other piece of furniture in the place, it faced the desk and TV. Either a foot away from the TV on a chair or trying to sit comfortably in bed at a more reasonable distance. The view out of the window was of the back of an equally tall building, but doubt that improves much anywhere in Manhattan.The bed was exceedingly comfortable and gave a great night's sleep. The bathroom was clean and modern. No dresser to speak of and just enough space in the closet for things for a few nights. An umbrella provided would've been useful had it been the rainy season. Mini-bar was empty and it appeared as though there was a second place for one in the desk which was left as a vacant space. Safe wasn't large enough for storing a larger laptop. Wifi was OK but without security. No parking. Building doubles as a residence.Location and cost per night for Manhattan made it worthwhile, but with the number of options available in NYC, I'll be trying somewhere else next time for the little things.","Toronto, Canada","PassportWielder</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",6,3.0

Despite being a corner room, only parts of the corner featured a window...it was mainly a hoax...On the 21st floor, hot water took a long time, think 5-10 minutes so it was best to turn on the hot water, hang out, and then jump into the shower. Wifi was decent and free. Requested a wake-up call for 3 mornings and only received 2...good thing I have an alarm on my phone......the thought process of the seating area and TV just didn't make sense.

It offers close walking proximity to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Broadway, 5th ave shopping, Central Park and most importantly several subway stations to get all over the city. The staff at Cassa was extremely accommodating with holding our bags when we arrived early in the morning and left late at night, and upgraded us from a double bed to a king bed. They have a coffee/tea station in the lobby which was always fully stocked no matter the time of day. The room was large and the bed was comfortable. We never tried the onsite restaurant or fitness center but they both looked nice! We also utilized their car service back to the airport as it was cheaper than a lyft/uber was for that time of day. On the downside there was no dresser in the room, I like to unpack my suitcase in hotels when there for several days and was not able to do that. There was also no extra blankets or pillows in the room and we had to call several times to have them delivered. The bathroom is big, bright and beautiful but the shower has a stupid design where water just goes all over the floor. The bathroom door handle also came off when I closed the door and had my friend not been in the room to let me out I would have been trapped in there until house keeping came the next day (note to self, bring phone in the bathroom). All in all it was a great stay at Cassa and I would 100% stay there again if I were to stay in the same area.

Located a few blocks from Times Square and 5th Avenue right on the corner, Rockefeller Centre is also a few blocks away it couldn't have been in a better location. The room was a great size with a massive modern bathroom, only downside was the wardrobe space, for 2 of us staying there we had to keep a lot of stuff in our cases but only a minor inconvenience as an iron and ironing board is in the wardrobe along with a safe and a small fridge. Nice big TV with a huge choice of channels and we were able to watch the late NBA and NFL games after a long day of sightseeing. The staff were nice and friendly always speaking to you as you passed through reception. Nice and quiet with little or no noise from street level.

Smooth check in - make sure you remember your card as they just put a small amount hold in case any damage which is pretty standard. Room was perfect for what we wanted - a really comfortable bed for resting after busy days sight seeing. We had fresh sheets & towels every day. Shower was a nice power shower. Good choice of films/TV channels for when we did pop back to the room before going back out. Air con / Heating in room - definitely needed for the cold November nights!! Upon check out stored our luggage for the day and organised a comfortable car to take us to the airport which I must say our driver was perfect after getting stuck in horrendous traffic which he said was almost his record for being the worst!

We walked to central park, rode bikes around for a couple of hours and walked home - not far at all.The only downfall was when we left for the airport we used the hotel driver (dont know if they have multiple) but he was driving a black GMC. He was unfriendly, almost scary actually. We were quoted by the hotel that it would cost total $115 inc tips and taxes to get to the airport and that we would pay him on arrival to airport. They advised eftpos was an option with a $6 surcharge. We were happy to pay this as we only had scraps of USD leftover. The man didnt speak the whole way there and on arrival told us it was $120 cash plus tips. He wasnt interested in my explanation of what the hotel had told us especially about paying eftpos. He was just ripping us off. We luckily managed to scrounge together $120 plus some leftover coins for tips.

Prior to our arrival I emailed the hotel a couple of times and the response was excellent and all our requests met! On check in we were given a complimentary upgrade to our room as it was my birthday. Our room was fantastic. The bed was huge and very comfortable. We had requested a high floor and were on the 25th. There was virtually no noise from the busy streets below or anywhere else within the hotel. We requested a coffee machine in our room which was there for our arrival and restocked every day. The shower was great and the toiletries in the room were lovely too. We also had a large tv, fridge, safe and pretty much everything you need even and ironing board! The room was also immaculate and serviced every day. We didn’t need to ask the hotel staff to arrange anything for us but we asked for recommendations for food etc and they were excellent. The guys on the door were also very helpful and attentive especially when checking out, storing our bags and helping load the car. The lemon infused water served in the lobby was a lovely refreshing touch after a long day of sightseeing. I really have nothing negative to say about this hotel. I will definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting New York in the future! Thank you Cassa for a great experience.

Staff were always helpful and friendly. However the breakfast served in the hotel's 'Butter Restaurant' in the dimly lit lower ground floor was a 'SHOCKER'. The bread and pastries looked and tasted stale and the toaster took forever to toast. No choice of fruit juices - the 1st morning serve yourself orange juice from the plastic container in an ice bucket - the 2nd morning small cans of pineapple juice in the same ice bucket. Only 1 cereal and pour yourself milk from the carton. The food in the bain-maries (scrambled egg, sausages, bacon etc) was overcooked and barely warm.

Not much noise from the street so you are sure to get a good nights sleep. My only criticism would be no free water top ups in room. They leave 2 bottles in there at a rip off $4 + taxes. You can walk for 30 seconds out the hotel and find bottles for $1.50 so i dont understand the logic. There are also no tea making facilities in the room, instead they keep this only in the lobby...not a massive issue but one for brits to be aware of.

Enjoyed everything about this hotel. The staff was so accommodating & helpful. I would like to give a shout out to several of the staff for exceptional customer service. Since it was my in-law’s golden anniversary, we wanted to do something special for them. Before arrival, I inquired about having flowers or wine delivered to their room for a surprise. Felecia emailed me back promptly with several options & even followed up on her day off to let me know that everything was confirmed & provided her manager’s email address should I need further assistance. Felecia & Patrick also helped coordinate transportation from the airport to the hotel. Our driver Darly was very friendly & texted us to let us know where to meet him after picking up our luggage. He helped with our bags & offered us water on our way to the hotel. Once at the hotel everyone made us feel welcome. Felecia & team did a wonderful job decorating the room with rose petals & even included a bottle of wine & 2 wine glasses. It really made our parents feel special & set the tone for the rest of our stay. Regarding the rooms – Our parents had a Jr Suite which was pretty spacious. Nice sitting area with couch, coffee maker, fridge. Large bathroom with double vanity & nice shower/tub combo w/plenty of luxury bath products. They enjoyed their large comfortable bed & huge flat screened tv. We had a Deluxe room with Queen bed which was smaller than their Jr Suite, (did not have the additional room with couch), but just as nice. Nice big bathroom with rain showerhead. Bed & linens were very comfortable. The rooms were so quiet & comfy that all of us slept in each day. My partner enjoyed the use of the gym each morning. Each time we returned to the hotel, the staff would welcome us back & ask if we needed anything. The location was perfect. Conveniently close to the Times Square & subways, yet far enough away if you wanted to avoid all the chaos & people. Walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Grand Central, Bryant Park, etc. Checking out was simple & again they arranged our return transportation to the airport. Cesar was our driver & got us through traffic & at the airport in no time. Normally I don’t have much interaction when traveling. I usually just check in & check out. The staff at Cassa was very different. Very friendly, professional, accommodating & helpful each & every day. Thank you for making this special occasion even more special. I will recommend Cassa to all my friends!","Columbus, Ohio","ColumbusJewel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>",22,5.0

One thing thay really annoyed us though was the check-in staff trying to persuade us to use their car to go to the airport. To book their car was $75 from the hotel to JFK and they told us that a yellow cab was not a set price going to the airport and on a weekend would cost us around $100 + tip. This is a total lie. Yellow cabs have a set fare to and from the airport of $62 or $65 if they take the toll road. Im not saying don't use the hotel car but there was no need to lie to try and get business.

Today after returning from a day out at 11.30pm (having left before 11.30am), I found my room had not been serviced and was begrudgingly offered fresh towels.

The hotel is in a great location in the middle of midtown. It is within walking distance to a lot of attractions. Times Square/Theatre District is just a few minutes walk away, Central Park around 20 minutes, 5th Avenue, Grand Central, Rockefeller Plaza are all under 15 minute walks away. Even the Empire State building is within walking distance as are the Piers for the sightseeing boat cruises or Water Taxi. Anyway enough about the location, the hotel itself is smart and clean although the room was not that big. The bed was also just a Double rather than a Kingsize bed. That was the only gripe, besides this this hotel is highly recommended. Staff are friendly and polite, the rooms are cleaned daily in a timely manner. If you are a tourist looking to visit all the major attractions and want to be able to get to most of them by walking and saving your cash for other purposes then book this hotel. We got the New York Pass and we walked to all the activities besides Brooklyn Bridge, World Trade Centre and the Statue of Liberty but if you have the Hop on Hop off bus tour you can use that wisely to do those activities. If using NYC Pass then use the free Water Taxi for the World Trade Centre as this is the best way to get there. The hotel is also conveniently close to TKTS the theatre ticket booth in Times Square for discounted theatre tickets and the theatres are located close by as well. If you want to go to do some discounted shopping you can tske a bus to Jersey Gardens, which is a 45 minute bus away, tickets can be bought from the Port Authority Bus Terminal which is about 10 mins walk away.

Bathroom and shower fine with complimentary toiletries.

The shower was a rainfall shower head and was really great. The hotel was eco friendly also and only changed linens and towels if requested which is great. If you left the do not disturb out, they honestly wouldn't touch the room. Reception: The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Very quick and easy check in and helped to check out and store our luggage for our last day. Recommended a good diner for breakfast around the corner and helped us to locate the nearest metro. Also the team helped us to book a cab to JFK airport which was a peace of mind. They provided a map on arrival of the area however there is a map on a leaflet on the table opposite the reception desk called the ""Broadway"" which is much better and more useful. As it has a good level of detail and subway details to navigate Manhattan. Location: The hotel is 5 minutes/1 block from Times Square, considering the distance it was absolutely perfect and yet it was nicely located that there was no noise from the streets in our room. The hotel is great, only things to improve on would be when providing instructions to guests it would be really helpful if they actually showed you on a map and drew the paths instead of verbally saying "" turn left, turn right, walk 3 blocks, turn left"" etc. It can be hard sometimes to grasp the directions especially if you ask for different places at the same time. It would be good to have two shower caps in the bathroom, although i'm sure if we had rang to ask for a second we would have received it.

Our first room faced the back, which would normally be great for light sleepers as it is away from the traffic and horns. However, there is some sort of construction back there and we had to really insist that they move us to the front. I don't appreciate that one has to ask 4 times before being given a peaceful room-- especially when it's for 7 nights. Once moved, our stay was blissful!We had breakfast included and I don't count that in my rating. Breakfast was good, in that it had plenty of proteins (yogurt, bacon, eggs) but terrible in that they were almost always cold with no fire under the steamer. I really do appreciate a breakfast in the mornings so was super grateful for it, anyway. The pastries were quite good. (in fact, we had a reservation at another hotel, but switched to this one because of the breakfast.) I would love to stay again, but don't want to have to fight for a room that's quiet... so would have to think twice.

Walgreens on the corner of 45th/7th for small incidentals. I did not request anything from housekeeping except I wrote a note requesting extra towels and I had a nightstand light that was not operable (it would just turn off and I could not get it to turn back on). There is no iron, bathrobes, coffee pot or mini-fridge - but they might have been available if I inquired? One side of the King bed had no electrical outlets and none in the wall either (at least visible). But the other side of the King did and also the desk area had outlets and USB outlet. Free internet access and it was fast. In the room, the windows open up about 5 inches, which was nice to get some fresh air and listen to the musicians/band playing lots of LTD, Michael Jackson, soulful R & B music on 6th Ave bet. 45 and 46. I heard them at least 2 nights and I was on the 21st floor facing 45th Street. The street noise was reasonable, more quiet on the weekends as opposed to Mon-Friday.

Check in, check out, and all of our interactions were pleasant. The hallway on the 7th floor (where we stayed) smelled of orange peel. Not bad (and obviously a spray) but I was glad that the smell didn't infuse the room as well. The room was a good size, actually rather large for NYC but there isn't a lot of storage space. There was a small closet behind the front door that I overlooked at first. The bathroom was clean and had a hand held shower want in addition to the shower head which was very nice. I like fairly hot showers and the separation between almost hot enough and scalding (for me) was not easy to hit. Worth it for the effort though.Location was great, just a block away from times square, very convenient to many great restaurants and transportation. The hotel also supplied an umbrella, free unless you don't return it, which came in very handy during the snow/rain that we had on our second day.Only issues that we had were minor but may be important for others. The bed is low, very low. basically on a box spring on the ground (no frame, college student style) That doesn't mean it's not nice. It was very comfortable and very well done ( nice headboard/sheets). but if a person had issues getting up or down it could be a concern for them. Also I'm a tech guy so when I set my room to cool on the thermostat and lowered the temperature I was not expecting it to be 85 degrees in my room with the heat blasting when I came back a few hours later. This wasn't a problem because I just cracked a window and shut off the AC but it obviously wasn't working correctly. We tend to stay at different hotels each time we visit NYC (a few times a year) but I could happily revisit this hotel, the location, cleanliness, and attitudes of the employees all made for a pleasant experience.","Vero Beach, Florida","michaelmV1223KK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vero Beach, Florida</strong>",2,5.0

The staff were all really friendly, giving me early access to the room on the day of arrival which was much appreciated.I think the biggest let down was the food options - ""Room service"" is based on supplies from Pret A Manger next door, and I don't understand why anyone would take the delivery service when you might as well go downstairs and fetch it yourself - which is cheaper and gives you a wider choice. The other dining option is in ""Butter"", the inhouse restaurant in the basement. I only went here for breakfast but at $25 plus tax for a pretty poor offering (not even any breakfast cereals!) I only did it once. And, they don't like you to charge your room, so you have to take money or prepay for breakfast - which I would not do, preferring instead to go out.I'd come back because the rate was good, but perhaps try and upgrade the room as some of the reviews refer to suites that maybe are better.","Glasgow, United Kingdom","Jordan1964</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glasgow, United Kingdom</strong>",160,3.0

Very Central and easy to be at a number of the tourists attractions within a few minutes walk. (Times Square, rockafella, Empire State, grand central station, Central Park etc) rooms are fairly small but most are in NYC but the hotel was pretty quiet which was nice and you will need your sleep if you doing lots in the days. They have a pret. Coffee shop below and a bar called butter but tbh I preferred to go and find a proper American diner for breakfast which cost a lot less the two I would recommend are one is opposite the entrance of grand central station. The other is just before the Empire State Building entrance they offer an unlimited buffet for $15.. the hotel do offer free tea, coffee & hot chocolate through out the day in reception. Staff are really friendly and nice! They do charge a city tax on hotel rooms approximately 5.8%. If you are visiting NYC plan your days and it's very busy and you don't want to miss out on attractions. Definitely get a city pass which offers substantial discount on entrance to attractions though you will still have to queue in some instances. Highly recommend the one world trade centre if the weather is good by far the best experience of going up a sky scraper even though it doesn't have a outside observation deck. Rockafella is well organised the most disappointing for me was the Empire State queues very long and staff very rude, wouldn't go back here. Don't forget there are plenty of free things to do in NYC like Central Park, the museums yes that's correct you don't have to pay, there are disclaimers by the tills stating they recommend you pay $20 entry but all you need to do is give a donation !!!! Don't be fooled by them. The only museum you have to pay for it the 9/11 memorial but it's well worth it! Don't forgot to down load the apps for all these attractions and take head phones again to avoid extra costs! Visit hell kitchens, Greenwich market and walk the Chelsea highline! Food and drink is super expensive in NYC unless you head down by soho and little Italy. In mid town expect to pay $9 or 10 for a drink if not more. Use the subway great way to get around and very cheap!! Walk over Brooklyn bridge again free and one of the highlights and views of my visit! Ride on the Roosevelt tram across to Roosevelt island for $3 dollars great views !!!!! Visit down town the financial district, system island ferry has huge queues so may be best to get there early to avoid long waits. St Patrick's cathedral again stunning and free. Don't forgot to check out the hidden cocktail bars that take you back in time to prohibition era though you will pay $14 per cocktail. If you can visit MAdison sq garden for a basketball or ice hockey game great location and try a frenchy hot dog !!!

They took our cell# to call/text when our room would be ready that afternoon.We heard from the front desk mid-afternoon as we were headed back to get our room keys. The 1BR suite was incredibly spacious for a NYC hotel. So much closet space that we easily could have unpacked for a week's stay. The bathroom had a huge walk-in shower as well as a full tub with shower. Large vanity and full size bath/shampoo products. there were robes and slippers in the room as well as a full size umbrella to use during our stay with the option to purchase.The staff for our one night stay was incredibly friendly, polite & helpful.

Apart from this the bathroom was one of the best bathrooms I've seen.Now for the staff!...Yes they are polite but in my opinion just can't be bothered with you. I've been to many hotels in my time and I'm so used to hi, bye, how are you, have you had a good day? Etc. None of that here at all! You check in (no welcome) it's a case of credit card and wait for your room. They even made us bring our own suit case to our room.Never acknowledge you when walking through hotel past reception staff, again what harm to 'hello' do.Check out again 'bye' no did you enjoy your stay no Thankyou for your stay, nothing.To me the hotel/staff are what make my holidays/vacations, this hotel just didn't do it for me.All thanks to the staff I sadly will not be returning to this hotel ( there much nicer in New York ) The hotel and location itself is great cannot fault this but the staff for me let this hotel down in my opinion.","Liverpool, United Kingdom","Samantharhodes85</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Liverpool, United Kingdom</strong>",66,4.0

It's just a few minutes away to Times Square. When everybody is already tired, i walked by myself to Times Square and it's pretty safe.

Our room has two beds and i've found it comfortable and the bathroom is really nice. They don't have a coffee maker but you can request a kettle if you need hot water for your tea and as i've mentioned coffee is available in the lobby. There's also a small fridge. The only thing that bothers me here is the elevator's light. It's too dark and it kinda scares me especially at night if i'm with another people inside.

The room was clean and big, we had two double beds and still had space to move around! Our room was quite at night which is a plus. The bathroom was clean and modern. The only negative point about the room is the lighting, we found it very dark due to the dimmed lighting ( modern ambiance I suppose) wasn't very practical to find things in your case. We also had a problem with the water at our sink, no cold water at the cold water tap, unless you run the shower at the same time?!?! The hotel was very efficient and sent a technician twice but the problem was not solved! We had breakfast at ""Butter"" the restaurant in the hotel it was included in our room rate! It is very dark and rather depressing on a morning. The food: bagel, scones, waffles...was the same every day, no cereal, tasteless fruit and if you came at 9:30 there was nothing left to eat or no coffee. On Sunday we came at 8:00pm there was just bread and giant croissants, uncooked waffles, uncooked egg and burnt bacon! No coffee or tea bags, no butter! I complained but the answer was it is Sunday!

First, I'll start with the good. The room was fabulous! It was big (by New York standards), cozy, comfortable bed and bedding, great bathroom, window faced the street not an alley, full-length mirror and the layout was excellent...not like a normal hotel layout. I can't say enough about how much I loved the room itself!! But I also saw a friend's room which was much smaller and a typical hotel room layout so I know not all the rooms were like mine. The other great part about this hotel is the staff. Everyone was very nice, super helpful and made me feel welcome. The bad: The rooms on the elevator side unfortunately have to put up with hearing all the dings and the woman's voice saying ""floor 7, going up""...etc, all night long. I was in a corner room, I wasn't even right across from the elevator! And since there are no long hall ways to get a room away from the elevator, you'll be near it unless you're on the other side from the elevator. Very few rooms per floor, so if you're on the elevator side, you'll hear it. It dings very loudly every time it stops on a floor and if it's on your floor, you WILL hear the woman's voice announce the floor and the direction it's going. If it's on the floor above or below, you still hear the ding. Now the reason I'm writing this is not to deter anyone from staying in this hotel because of it...but because I hope someone from Cassa is reading it and will TURN IT DOWN! There has a to be a volume setting on it. There is NO reason why you couldn't, it's not like someone in the elevator won't hear it and miss their floor! Just turn it down, it's ridiculously loud.A little about the neighborhood: If I wasn't there for the Thanksgiving parade, it wouldn't be my first choice of neighborhoods. It's right in the middle of the midtown Manhattan chaos. If you want to be near the shopping on 5th Ave, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, etc....then it's great. I just found it to be a little too crowded and crazy for my liking. But for tourists who want to be in the middle of everything, you'd like it if you don't mind the noise, the trash on the streets and the Halal food carts on every corner. And now for the Ugly. It's back to the elevators. They're horrific. Cassa....PLEASE update them. They're brown, dark boxes. Brown walls, brown carpet that looks like it from the 80's. It's all the same shade of dark brown. If this was a design decision, it's terrible. Luckily the rooms are gorgeous and very well designed and decorated...but the elevators don't fit in at all and are terribly ugly and uncomfortable!!Bottom line, great hotel because of the lovely rooms and wonderful staff, but the elevators all around need to be addressed. And if you're a light sleeper and don't like noise, you WILL hear a lot of noise through the night both from outside and from the elevators. Which I hope the hotel will try to change. My guess is because they don't sleep there, they have no idea how loud the dings and that woman's voice is!! Elevators aside, I had a wonderful stay and enjoyed my very cozy bed...which was my favorite part.",,debschicago,20,4.0

It is literally 2 blocks from time square and central for virtually everything you could need in New York. We got the train from JFK airport and then walked to the hotel, much cheaper than a cab. Check in was efficient, the room was small (by UK standards) but quite generous by New York proportions! As the hotel is quite small there was never any problem with queuing for lifts or reception. The room was modern, clean and nice and quiet. When we first checked in, the safe didn't work, we phoned down to reception who arranged for a guy to come up and fix it straight away (who ended up replacing it), the only other minor issue was that the maid took the dressing gown out of the room on the 3rd day and didn't replace it. There is free coffee / water available in reception at various times which was an added bonus. We had booked to see the Knicks and our tickets came through on email at the last minute - reception were happy to print them out for us, which was great (god knows where we would have gone to do that otherwise!). Upon checkout we were offered a car to the airport for a set fee (something like $50), having been to New York before and experienced the pure terror of a yellow cab driver who thought he was in grand theft auto we happily accepted. It actually turned out to save us money as we were going to La Guardia (which is not a set fare with yellow cabs) we got stuck in some major traffic and ended up detouring - for no extra cost. I would definitely recommend this option if flying from La Guardia. All in all, I would happily stay here again in an instant, we booked majorly in advance (something like 11 months!) and got our stay for half price which was a steal.

After our arrival flight was cancelled, we missed the first night of our prepaid reservation. (lesson learned, never again will I prepay!) Once we arrived at the Cassa and explained our situation, the gentleman checking us in didn't offer up any empathy. He handed us a key card and pointed to the elevator. The elevator was so dark it was hard to read our room number in there. We found our Executive king room to be smaller than expected but comfortable. It was very quiet and the showers are great. It was the details that got us. The door stop in the bathroom was laying on the ground leaving an exposed hole in the wall. The walls are covered in scuff marks and are in desperate need of a paint job. One afternoon after our room was serviced, housekeeping left a roll of toilet paper just thrown on the bathroom floor. Our trash was not emptied the other day of our stay. The biggest issue I had were these small bugs that we found on the bathroom counter. There were only a few so we didn't think it was a huge deal until we got home and brought them with us in our luggage. We both had bug bites all over us for the better part of a week. I however, did not speak up while at the hotel so I can't entirely fault them for this. In hindsight I should have asked to switch rooms. So while we did find some positives in our stay such as the location, the quiet rooms, and aside from our initial contact with the front desk we found the rest of the staff to be very friendly, the devil is in the details and they missed the mark for us.","Greenville, South Carolina","greenville_girl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greenville, South Carolina</strong>",25,3.0

Two rooms had been booked on Hotels.com. Be aware that there is another hotel with a similar name – this review covers the one on located on West 45th StreetThe sole check-in receptionist was businesslike and efficient but appeared rather cold...no smile, no small talk and no real welcome to the hotel. Certainly he didn’t give a great initial impression which was disappointing, particularly as it doesn't gel with previous reviews. Must have been an off night!However, the two queen bed rooms were fine, if as others have said before, a little on the small side. Both were of a contemporary style and reasonably well equipped – a comfortable bed, great TV, built-in USB plugs at side of bed, safe, iron and ironing board – but most importantly it was clean and well maintained. There were no tea making facilities in the room although coffee was provided in the reception area every morning. Bathroom was also a good size with a powerful shower. There was no view from either of the rooms – except of other office buildings as you might expect although this did give some privacy at night - and there was nowhere at all to store our cases. The reception area is quite small with a small seating area and, apart from the hotel restaurant, there is no other public area or bar in which to linger.Air con in the room was a bit noisy during the night – but not as noisy as leaving the windows open. We were located at the rear of the building (not street side) as where the huge air con fans so even though we were on the 7th floor we still had to keep the windows closed if we wanted to sleep.No breakfast was included in the rate – but there are many good options in the vicinity. Pret is literally next door and there are several restaurants across the street (O’Lunney’s was of particularly good value and had a good choice of menu) offering decent food day and night. Where the hotel really excelled was in its location – literally one block and just far enough away from the mayhem that is Times Square and within reasonable strolling distance from 5th Avenue shops, Radio City and the other sites of midtown.On checkout we enquired about travel options to Newark – reception advised that they could provide a hotel car service for $95 all in, which given we were a party of four seemed a reasonable cost. However final payment ended up being $110 as a credit card surcharge was added which wasn’t notified when we booked. That was disappointing, particularly as I had asked about using the credit card..Overall the stay was fine but I have to say it was not exceptional. It’s a pleasant enough hotel in a reasonably quiet area but still close enough to the action. While I would consider staying again its worth remembering there are many other accommodation options in the area which could be just as good if not better.","Belfast, UK","AlwaysReady2Go</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Belfast, UK</strong>",136,3.0

Unfortunately nobody made a note in our file despite calling twice months ahead of time. That being said, the staff were very accommodating and compassionate, and were able to move us to another upgraded room the next day , as they were fully booked that night, and also provided us with cookies, chocolates, complimentary breakfast, and a lovely note telling us to enjoy our stay and have a happy anniversary. I thought this was a very sweet touch. Whatever questions we had or things needed were provided to us promptly. Parking is expensive but we were also given a $10 voucher towards it. Felicia and jermaine were specifically outstanding to us during our stay. The rooms are very small and if you are sleeping with someone else in bed it is worth upgrading as it is about the size of a twin bed for the standard rooms.

Apparently there are 2 Cassa hotels (i.e. this Cassa doesn't have a hot tub and doesn't give free breakfast but the other does so be mindful that some reviewers may accidentally write a review for the wrong location).Location - Amazing. About a 3minute walk to Times Square; 3minute walk to the subway station that will take you to the main tourist spots and a lot of restaurants on the street you can go to for all your meals if you wish! Service - Amazing as well. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived (we got in early around 10am) but they allowed us to go to the gym area to freshen up, use the washrooms etc. and held our bags which we felt was safe. The only thing is is that they don't provide free water in the rooms. You have to pay $4 USD a bottle. Thankfully we had brought our own water bottles and you can refill them in the gym. (Code required from front desk). So make sure to bring your bottles for free...you will need the water throughout the day as it was scorching hot when we went in August! One night we arrived back at our room at midnight to find our AC wasn't working. We called the front desk and someone was up immediately, changed the filter and within 20mins it was back up and running. Rooms - my first time in NYC so don't know what other hotels are like, but it had enough space for what we needed and was clean, modern and well kept. Food - didn't eat here so can't say but in the mornings there were apples, tea and coffee in the lobby. Between 5-6 they have free champagne (wasn't around for it but I'm sure it's good!) and in the afternoon-evening they have lemon water in the lobby as well. Our itinerary (if you're interested)We were here for 4 full days and tried to see/do as much as possible as it was our first time. Here is what we did and hopefully this will give you an idea of what's feasible!Day 1: Getting to the hotel - from Laguardia airport, you can take the Q70 bus, get off at Roosevelt Avenue (about a 10-15minute bus ride) and then hop on the subway. I believe it was the F. You can get off at Bryant Park or Rockefellar Ctr. They are both about a 3-5minute walk to the hotel...the hotel has easy access to the B, D, F and M trains. Note - a taxi would cost about $50 for this one way trip. For our whole trip, we spent about $55 on the metro. Amazing and faster then a car. We spent the majority of the day roaming about Times Square, had breakfast/lunch there and walked down the Theatre district, watched some street performers and just took in the city. We did this from 10-3pm and then had plans to meet up with family.Day 2:Took the subway to South Ferry Station where you can get on the Staten Island Ferry (For FREE) and see the Statue of Liberty. You're not SUPER close to it but close enough to see the face/head etc. The ferry comes every 30mins. People will lie to you on weekends to try to get you to pay for the tour...they tell you it comes every 2 hours but we went and checked and realized they were just trying to get a sale so please be a smart tourist and dont believe what is said. Do your research. We then walked through Wall Street, saw the Raging bull (iconic bull for the stock market) and then walked on the Brooklyn bridge from Manhattan to Brooklyn. There is a beautiful waterfront park when you get to Brooklyn that you can chill out at for however long. Take a blanket! We then hopped on a subway from Brooklyn back to our hotel. We had dinner reservations at Toloache (mexican) and well-rated on TripAdvisor so we tried it out. AMAZING!! It was very busy so make reservations. We then went to the Aladdin show on Broadway. WOW. Best money I've spent in a long time! After the show, we explored Times square at night (so many lights!) Day 3:Got an early start. Walked 25mins to breakfast at Penelope's (well rated on Trip Advisor) - a small mom and pop place. Again, very good. Pricey but good. On our walk there, we saw the Empire State building. Then we took a subway to One World Trade Centre, the memorial and we went to the museum and spent about 3.5-4 hours there. Could have spent more time there but we got hungry! It was a great experience. Note that on Tuesdays, the entry is free from 5-7pm but it will be busy. We paid $24 a person for entry. Perhaps you can find coupons on line. We didn't search. Then we took the subway to grand central station to see it (pretty nice!) and then walked up 5th avenue (lots of expensive stores) to Central Park where we hung out for a bit. We then did Rockafellar Centre (grabbed food truck food for dinner and sat in the Rock plaza to eat) and then got tickets for Top of the Rock. Note - you will want to buy tickets in advance. We went at 9pm and the next available time was for 10:25pm. Not bad, but dont expect to go there, buy tickets and go straight up. We thought the night view was amazing. Day 4:We booked 2 free tours (google ""Free tours by Foot"") of Soho, Little Italy and Chinatown and Greenwich Village. Each were 2 hours long. Soho was at 10-12 and Greenwich was 2-4. They are close to eachother, so there is enough time for lunch in between and you can walk from one village to the next. We ate at Piccolo Cucina (Italian) based on TripAdvisor reviews and it was amazing! If you're a Friends fan (the show), the Greenwich village tour will take you Monica/Rachel's apartment. So the tours are free, but you pay what you want at the end of it. People seemed to be giving $10/person but it's really up to you. An inexpensive way to see the city and get a good bang for your buck. The company has other tours as well. Then we went to a baseball game (Toronto Vs. New York). Again, super easy to get to the Bronx to the Yankee Stadium. Then ended back at Times square to hang out. So, a busy packed trip but saw a lot! We are a 28 year old couple with no kids! If you have any questions about costs, timings of activities or anything at all, let me know and I will be happy to help!","Kitchener, Canada","skrsToronto</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kitchener, Canada</strong>",95,5.0

The rooms are comfortable and well appointed, the staff helpful. Because I stayed here two years ago, when I knew I was going to return to NYC for four nights in the summer of 2016, I checked availability. When TripAdvisor advertised a special rate, I checked out the options carefully...and I do mean carefully. I saw the different room sizes, the bed options, etc., and double checked that I had selected a room with two beds. HOWEVER, when I checked in, the hotel said that the confirmation number I had was not theirs and the room I had been assigned was a single double bed. Even though my printout said DELUXE DOUBLE they insisted that I had a STANDARD room with one double bed. They worked with us and shifted things around so that at least three of the four nights I was in a room with two beds, though the last night my traveling companion and I were moved to a room with only one bed. PLUS the hotel charged me an upgrade fee that came to almost $200 for the four nights. I don't think this is rare....because on more than one occasion as I was entering or exiting the hotel, I heard the front desk explaining to people that the room they thought they booked wasn't the one they were given but could have for an upgrade fee. Who's going to turn that down? You're in NYC tired from traveling without any other place to go...so either the hotel is deliberately scamming customers or there is a serious lack of communication between the hotel and the booking agencies who work with them, such as Booking.com and TripAdvisor. I love the hotel....it is quiet and comfortable and safe and convenient, so I hope they sort out the issue so that customers aren't caught off guard like I was.","Rock Hill, South Carolina","kmcspadden</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rock Hill, South Carolina</strong>",5,5.0

Perfect location to get anywhere as in the heart of the city.Plenty of places to eat or drink right on the doorstep and several local shops within seconds from the hotel for take outs for the room if needed.Hotel was very quiet we were on the 16th floor and although there was traffic on the road throughout the day if the window is shut......you don't hear anything!!!! Great double glazing! Rooms were cleaned every day! And housekeeping always helpful for extra towels and such like!....you don't always get this in other hotels in NYCFREE Tea, Coffee and fruit in the lobby each morning which was nice.The Staff at this hotel are some of the finest I have ever come across in all my travels and certainly the very best I've known in all my trips to NYC, very polite and helpful and very knowledgably on what's on and where to be all day long! so helpful, Everyone always had a smile and always had the time for you, this is not always the case in other hotels, especially in NYC....Big thanks to all the staff but a special shout out for Felecia, Osei, James, Jonathan, Adam and a huge shout out for the two 'main men' at the front of the hotel Julio & Sam (you guys Rock!)We had a ball at the hotel, will be back for sure, thanks to you all for looking after us so well!John & Gill","Immingham, United Kingdom","shadowmanpictures</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Immingham, United Kingdom</strong>",3,5.0

Although payment was not required at time of booking, I called the hotel directly to arrange payment to have it taken care of there and then, and at that time anyone i spoke to or emailed was exceptionally friendly and polite.On arrival our room wasn't ready but we may have been slightly early so this wasn't an issue, they took our luggage and we went out for a while and on returning they had taken our luggage up to room, they had given us room 24 on floor 6, nice touch as our anniversary was 24/6.Unfortunately it was downhill from there.Despite this being a room booked for 3 people, 2 adults and a 12 year old, clearly stated at time of booking and also during my discussions directly with the hotel staff back in October, we had one queen size bed. Having visited NY several times previously, being given a queen room has never been a problem as we have always had a single bed added for our son.Not at the Cassa. I queried this at front desk and the receptionist called his manageress, then suggested I could have a roll-away bed for our son for an extra $35/night! How kind, letting me pay for a bed for the third person in our group, after having booked and paid for 3 people already?!?!?Needless to say I declined this generous offer and the manageress duly appeared to discuss further.The nice lady again asked if i wanted to have the roll-away at the stated price and as I declined she then offered to cancel my booking!Yes, at around 6pm on the day of arriving in NY she was telling me she could cancel my booking and I could leave the hotel. Not sure if anyone you know reserves a second hotel when going on holiday but I certainly don't, so her ultimatum was pay up extra or find another hotel there and then.I spoke to my wife and she agreed that we would not be paying and would rather leave than deal with this manageress and her unbelievably rude demeanour. By this time I was getting extremely aggravated, been up for about 22 hours, a long flight from the UK and then this, and she wonders why I'm raising my voice?!?When I paid back in October I paid using my debit card which is instant transfer from cash funds in my bank. I told her I would like the same method used for refund and would expect an instant transfer to my account as she refused to issue a cash refund, I explained I would need this done immediately to allow me to find and book another hotel. Yup, you've guessed, not possible! She would authorise a refund but not guarantee it would reach my account immediately.By this time another more senior ""manager"" appeared, I assume that's who he was because I wasn't introduced. He confirmed that a refund had been issued and showed me a receipt, I in turn showed him my online bank account, confirming NO payment received, not their problem was the response. I believe it was at this point the manageress realised my wife was filming the whole episode on her phone, and as my wife and I had stepped away from reception to discuss our options regarding another hotel, she had words with the other manager.He then offered to discuss further as they did not want us to leave the hotel, I told him quite clearly that all she had offered was pay up or leave, which did not sound like ""please stay"" or ""let us try and resolve this"". Amazing what a camera can do.He then changed his tune and offered to let us re-book and waive the extra charge, in my opinion this option should have been discussed at the outset. My son made the choice for us, clearly stating that he did not wish to stay in a hotel where the staff treat guests in the manner they were. Luckily we were able to find another hotel not too far and although it was more expensive, and we also paid extra charges for booking by credit card, it was worth every penny to get out of the Cassa.Numerous visits to NY and by far the worst experience in any hotel we have stayed in. I have always been impressed by the way American hotel staff go out of their way to be polite and helpful no matter what you ask for, but this hotel is the exception by some distance. Never again would I even consider this hotel and would advise anyone thinking about it, find another place where the manager actually listens to your concerns and doesn't try and throw you out for complaining!",greenock,"jostro65</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>greenock</strong>",14,1.0

We were able to get a reasonable price, by Manhattan standards, by using an online travel service. We opted for an Executive King room with breakfast included. The spacious room on the 21st floor was modern and clean with an excellent shower and a nice view of the city. No vista of Central Park or the landmark skyline buildings, but still an urban view of many edifices. The location of the hotel is excellent, on 45th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues, placing it right between Times Square and Rockefeller Center. Finding the entrance to the hotel is a little tricky, since there is no prominent sign -- look for the Butter Restaurant. The included breakfast was adequate, especially since our effective rate was $15 each, instead of the added charge of $25 for non-breakfast reservations. It was served buffet style, and included oatmeal, waffles, scrambled eggs and bacon, along with coffee, juices, and some assorted breads. By the way, there is a Pret A Manger right next store so getting breakfast on your own is not a problem.

To my suprise it turns out the Hotel actually delivered on so many fronts, first of all check in was efficient and receptionists were professional, courteous and caring. The room was more spacious for what you get in NY, it was clean and comfortable, also there were two windows in my room no view but plenty of light coming in, which is important to me, the last thing you want is to be holed up in a dark, dingy stuffy room in NY. Bathroom was recently renovated with the shower particularity amazing! house keeping was efficient but I did note that sheets weren't changed in around four to five days. now the best aspect of this place is its location, it is a seven minute leisurely walk to the times square and Broadway theaters, since the hotel is located right infront the avenues of Americas, the road is pretty safe, wide and busy but not as hectic as it is in times square, which gives you a nice reprieve from the craziness. Bryant park is a short walk away and access to Rockefeller center and 5th avenue is also quite convenient. Subway access is immediate and direct, the location can't be faulted. now there is one stark negative and that is the Hotel's breakfast arrangements with the attached restaurant Butter, buffet choice is very limited, poor and repetitive, service is cold and akward. since there aren't alot of people you basically dine in a empty restaurant and are made to feel like you are a nuisance to whoever is in charge of the morning shift. therefore, I would urge anybody booking to avoid breakfast as it is of no value and choices around you are far richer.however this didn't dampen my overall enjoyment of the hotel and with a good deal this is a pretty great place to set up camp in New York.",Bahrain,"TheWanderrr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bahrain</strong>",58,4.0

Presence on street as with many of the boutique hotels in NYC is minimal with the attached restaurant Butters, getting a much higher billing and presence. We booked through an internet booking site and went for the low price posted. Little did we know that the low price room, of which I believe there are many at this hotel, is a fairly small room with, hold on, a small bed. My wife, travelling with me, and I are not big people by any means (Asian sized to put in a nutshell) and we could not see ourselves getting a decent night's sleep packed into that bed. So buyer beware. We complained that we'd never seen such a small bed in a hotel room in N. America, Europe yes where the rooms are even smaller, but that's expected, not in the US! When taken the matter to the front desk soon after we saw the room, the hotel did help us out to our satisfaction. But we should not have to go through this.Who ever made the executive decision to order those small beds made the wrong decision as this does not endear the hotel's clients to the hotel for future visits. Perhaps they thought most clients using this size of room would be a single person as it's definitely not a two person room and the hotel should make that known if they know there will be two occupants.Otherwise the hotel is pretty straight forward. Modern though minimal black lobby (why are so many boutique hotels going this route? An Architect myself, the idea is great if it is handled well, but not many do including Cassa Hotel.)Minimal closet space, bathroom was adequate though some of the silver leaf on the illuminated vanity mirror was coming off - don't see that much.And the hotel name is the same as another unrelated hotel on 9th Avenue. Surely one of the two parties should have avoided this problem which will no doubt lead to upset customers.","West Vancouver, B. C.","WestVanMan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Vancouver, B.

Breakfast is served in the restaurant called Butters which is in the basement. Again there was hardly any light. We were usually the only 4 people there. Although the breakfast tasted fine it was repetitive and limited in choice. I am not sure if I could have eaten for less in an outside cafe so overall it served its purpose.

We picked this hotel because the reviews were positive and the location was exactly what we were looking for. The room was clean and surprisingly spacious. The king bed was comfortable although the pillows were a little soft for my taste. I can't really speak about the view so much but let's face it, it's in the city....you'll see buildings. The shower was great. Our room had a rainfall shower head, the pressure was excellent and we never ran out of hot water. There is no ice machine at the hotel but if you call the front desk, they'll deliver a bucket of ice to you immediately. The fridge in the room (you may have to call and request one) is small but big enough to hold some soda or water. They have breakfast buffet available at an additional charge. It's actually provided by the restaurant next door. The hotel also has car service to the airport. For $55 (tax and tip included), you can easily schedule a ride to the airport. We weren't coming in from the airport so I'm not sure if they provide airport pick-up as well.The staff at the hotel was amazing. They were very courteous and responded quickly to anything we needed.

The Cassa hotel is by far the best hotel I've stayed in yet. The concierge team were polite and professional and always happy to help. Our room was on the fourth floor but this had no impact on sleeping conditions as i didn't hear a peep from the road below. The room was spacious and bathroom was also a decent size. The shower was also amazing! The fitness room on the 10th floor was excellent and keeps you ticking over nicely and makes you feel a little bit better about all the amazing new York food you're consuming.One downside which wasn't really an issue i'm just being fussy is that we booked the hotel through hotels.com. when booking there was no mention that it was special low cost deal which meant we would have no room maintenance, i.e fresh towels and have the room tidied and bed made.This wasn't a big deal really as my wife does all that stuff anyway probably better than the maid would but hey ho sometimes these are nice luxuries to have. A few areas of improvement for me is that as I am a Brit i love my Tea, the hotel only offers a complimentary tea and coffee service in the morning. However if i had asked in the evening i'm sure they probably would've been happy to help. I would recommend it if the tea and coffee service was available throughout the day.Complimentary wifi was also included which was a nice bonus however at times it was quite slow so you wont be able to stream movies etc but it served the purpose if you just wanted to check whats-app or Facebook.Upon checking out again the concierge team were excellent, we had a late flight so we needed to leave our bags at the hotel. they did this free of charge which was nice as other hotels have charged me for this service.I will definitely be returning to the hotel. its location was about a 5 minute walk from times square but secluded from the mad rush of the tourists!

The bed was comfortable and the room had a large bathroom and great shower. Iron, ironing board, extra bath robe were all supplied quickly when requested.However there was no storage space beyond a narrow hanging rail in the wardrobe. We arrived with clothes for a 6 day trip. My daughter unpacked onto the floor, I unpacked onto the desk. There was no downstairs entrance/reception due to refurbishment which apparently had been ongoing since February but no-one communicated to us until we arrived to what looked like a derelict building. The seedy side entrance and narrow corridors were far from the 'boutique' experience described on the hotel website - it felt like we were entering a block of residential flats.We were checked in at approx 11 pm and given no printed receipt or acknowledgement and told that we had to authorise a 75$ a day security 'deposit' which would be returned on check out (assuming no damage or charges - for what?). That was 450$ for our 6 day stay! I received no satisfactory explanation for this requirement, again not communicated prior to arrival, despite asking twice to see a manager (""no-one available""). On check out, after asking again, I was given a print out which refers to Additional Charges without actually specifically mentioning 75$.There was no hotel bar - the restaurant bar closed at 10.30 with the restaurant. No mini bar (although an empty one was placed in the wardrobe using up valuable storage space) and no room service. No TV instructions, no hotel directory with local sights, hotel facilities etc etc (just a pamphlet), and the room, although large, was very dingy although apparently recently revitalised.","London, United Kingdom","Diane M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",6,2.0

There are also loads of subway stations nearby - the station at Times Square can take you to most of the tourist attractions quickly and easily! It's also about a 15-20 minute walk from Central Park too, which makes the location even more ideal.The room itself was fantastic - we were upgraded to a Super King size room with super fast wifi. The bed was honestly the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in (but maybe that was because of all the walking!). There is also a large power shower in the bathroom, along with hairdryer, dressing gown, slippers, and shower gel and shampoo. The room also has a large screen TV which is perfect when you need to relax after a long day!They also offer take-out coffee for free in reception each morning!The staff are really friendly and will do anything they can to help - the hotel porter spent about 20 minutes trying to flag us down a taxi to Newark airport on our departure (tip: if you're heading to Newark in rush hour, book in advance as not many are willing to take you that far in rush hour!)We actually got engaged while we were in New York, and the hotel surprised us with a congratulations card, box of handmade chocolates and some fizzy water in the room which was a really lovely touch!Overall, we highly recommend staying here - it's the perfect location for exploring New York and really good value for money if you book early!","Manchester, United Kingdom","Katherine D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",17,5.0

Who cares about a little inconvenience when you are on a ""quiet"" street and within walking distance to the theater district and so many other attractions, not to mention a fairly competitive rate? I have to say that the Junior Suite (room 505 with a comfy roll-away)) more than met expectations for my husband, adult daughter, and me. It was so quiet that we thought we were the only people on the hall until we finally heard the maid outside of the room one day. We NEVER heard street noise either (room faced inner courtyard so no ""view"") when we were in the room which was basically from about 11:30pm - 10:30 am. So, a nice CLEAN, QUIET, and adequately sized room in a terrific location---Some have complained about room size and closet space--geez people-- Cassa offers any size room you could want---pick the right one for you and don't complain! Also we had a mini refrigerator and Keurig coffee maker. We asked for ice and towels on two separate occasions and both were promptly delivered. NEVER A PROBLEM WITH ELEVATORS during our 3 night stay. What else could you want? Oh yeah, helpful and friendly staff: Sam, Jonathan, Jason, Nixon, Lynelle, Patrick and others (who unfortunately I cannot name) were all SUPER, despite the inconvenience of construction and check-in/check-out, etc. I have stayed at the Marriott Marquis, Milford, Shelburne and Fitzpatrick Manhattan on Lexington Ave and the staff at Cassa were the best!

Once we arrive, we almost missed it--the lobby is being redone, so the entrance is somewhat utilitarian--you enter via the staff entrance, head down a back hall, and take the elevators to the 11th floor where the temporary lobby is set up. There was a bellman at the door to guide us initially, otherwise we would never have found it.The current lobby was a converted room. The staff was very helpful, and checked us in promptly (and gave us some restaurant advice). There is a lounge with always-on coffee and tea.We went up to our room, which was very clean. There was plenty of storage space, and the bathroom was excellent-sized with a view of Times Square. The shower was very large, with a large shower head and decent pressure and water and the whole bathroom was very clean, with nice amenities. The TV was fine, and we were able to access wifi. If I had a complaint (and I don't know if we were in a particular corner), but the building had a lot of internal noises during the night.

For avoidance of doubt, I don't blame the staff as they were generally very courteous during our stay - over accommodating, not exactly, but then again it's not a 5* property on Columbus Circle, but I've had more genuine (authentic/caring) service at less rated hotels. They really should hand you a hard hat and map when you check-in, that is after you wind through two elevators and a staircase and end up in a makeshift check-in suite. The disclaimer about the construction in the lobby impairs your stay more than the management will claim to admit. The room, well, underwhelming and a bit of an afterthought is likely the best way to encapsulate the atmosphere. A standalone armoire is jammed between the column and the window, which can barely hold enough garments for one person for a three night stay. The carpet has an obnoxious pattern which reminds me of a midrange hotel room in Vegas - which as we know is more about hiding stains then embracing a design motif. Is the room clean, yes, more or less - but I've stayed at three star properties which are cleaner and better maintained. The room is a bit worn down. The USB jacks are dusty, the electric outlets on desk had broken jack covers, and the room just felt a bit raked over. The bed, in general, not bad for a good night sleep. Clean crisp starched linens - definitely not Frette, likely 300 thread count. They don't use a full duvet cover, so the super thin down comforter, likely less fill than the lightest puffer coat you own, has a tendency to come undone during the night. In fact, my comforter had dried blood stains from a prior guest; however, in all fairness the housekeeping promptly gave me a new, clean, comforter. Housekeeping, only praises - room was tidy and clean every night we returned. My only complaint was the room did show many signs of wear that needed more than a bottle of Windex to resolve. If the room followed the decor of the bathroom it would be a much better ""room"". Except for the cheap frames that encased the basin, the bathroom, shower, and toilet were a pleasant match of expectations. The bath amenities could be better, like the cheaper, yet comfortable towels. You feel the cheapness and the corner-cutting, but you don't let it bother your because the bathroom is bright, white, clean and the shower head rains water which puts you the sleep after a long day. Butter restaurant - One morning we decided to wind down the stairs into the dark basement - no host, very few people, and a self serve bar with granola (probably leftovers from some dinner dessert) and a carafe of coffee. We immediately left, said glad we didn't pay for breakfast, and had an excellent bagel and coffee from the kosher joint next store. The restaurant is drab, cold, and a bit cavern like. I can't comment on the food because we didn't even get to a host to seat us. The gym. Don't even bother using the five, cheap, home quality cardio machines - head straight to Equinox (which is free) and only a few blocks away. In summary, this is definitely no Viceroy. In fact, I think the company should split it off from their brand - in my view does more to hurt than to help. They management understates the impact of the construction. I'd rate this a 3.9 on a good day. It's NYC, others hotels strive harder for experience, guest, and decor. Putting an orchid by the entry to security lobby (which is the main entry of the hotel for now) doesn't negate the other flaws. If I didn't pay such a reasonably rate I'd be perturbed. Needless to say, please save the canned reply that was my last stay at this Cassa. ",,OnlyFlyG650,6,3.0

Getting in and out required changing an elevator. Other than that, it was a nice stay. We like the modern and clean design of the room and the bathroom. Closet space is a bit small but it was OK for our short stay. Check-in was smooth although we witnessed an unhappy customer who was loudly expressed his displeasure for not having a room adjacent to his travel companion's.

It wouldn't have put me off, but it would've annoyed me a lot less to know beforehand and be expecting it.The room itself was nice, the beds are great and the shower is lovely, however for our first two days we didn't receive any housekeeping, no fresh towels, nothing.

They were remodeling the front entrance, and I entered through the Butter (a dining restaurant) door adjacent to the Cassa sign and walked haphazardly. In fact, there is a nondescript black door next to the Butter door, which leads directly to the Cassa elevators. It was confusing but upon the check-in, everyone was very friendly.I booked via hotwire for a good rate, but as such I didn't get any of their normal website rooms. And the guy was well versed. We got a standard size room, which he mentioned was slightly bigger than normal with a full-size bed. The full-size bed was small as expected but we adapted, and the room was small as well, but made use of the space. Everything was there, and no problems with the room itself. It had a nonexistent view of a nearby building. So the room was standard, and they need to clean the dust off of the top bedframe area. However, the rate is good but most of all the location is great. It's right at the midpoint, walkable distance to almost everything. Closest subway is south, where Bryant Park is (for ice skating needs until 3/6). East is the Grand Central Terminal. West is Times Square. North is the Rockefellar Center and Top of the Rock Observation. Northeast is 5th avenue and around a 20 min walk to the Northwest end of Central Park. So everything was pretty much walkable, as long as you are prepared to do so.Wifi was free, but at times slow. Parking, I read up was around $60 for valet. On 44th st, there is an Edison Parkfast, which I believe have much lower rates for February (within 5 minutes walk). And for load off and dropping, they have a small area, but since it's in a high traffic area, may be hard to drive around. So 100% do not suggest driving here whatsoever, took 20 minutes just to move 0.5 miles.So despite those slight faults, the service stood out. They didn't have ice, so they delivered it up. They didn't have a business center, so they printed it for us, just had to email them. And every single hotel staff was friendly.

We lost precious time and boarded elevator with trepidation.. Went to MoMA, dinner and On Your Feet ( terrific by the way) came back to hotel to discover at 10:30 both elevators again not working ! We are sent to 10 th floor "" lounge"" via an elevator that only goes to the 10th to a room that looks like a school classroom with no comfortable seating or charm. Everyone is tired . They keep popping up and telling us they are working on it. People are writing on twitter and Facebook and insisting they won't pay. Finally they come and reluctantly I get in the elevator terrified it will stop with us in it and we go to bed late. In the morning under m door is the bill fir the full $350 plus ! Breakfast buffet included when we went down at 10:30 was a few dried scrambled eggs and scraps of bacon. They were to close at 10:30 which on a Sunday morning is absurd. I go to the front desk with my bill and basically say "" you are kidding right ?"" He reduces it by half and I just want out so I leaveHere's what should have happened. They should have gotten drinks from somewhere nearby and brought them to all of us waiting in that grim "" lounge"". No one should have been charged anything for that night and the Bill under the door should have stated that with deepest apologies. Clearly management was hedging their bets hoping people would just pay. The staff was lovely but unprepared to deal with this nightmare and it was handled unprofessionally and I'm guessing the directives were not the staffs choosing.

You can get the same line a few stops earlier to chambers street and then walk 10 mins maxto Ground zero. There is a line to world trade centre but this is a further subway from the hotel.You just buy one metro card, my hubby went through passed the card back to me then I went through, they tell you to do this at the station. The hotel told us directions for the subway and the front desk where so helpful saved us money and time.Ok so the sightseeing. In my opinion the Top of the Rock is fab for views over New York at night, you go to 3 different levels so big tip if you want to do some night time selfies with Empire State in the background level 3 you don't have any railings so can get good pic.Empire State we did fast track excellent to avoid queues.Intrepid sea air and space museum we booked a Concorde tour it's 50 mins and well worth it.Ground zero you must go in the museum so sad but worth walking round to see what they have done to preserve some of the old building and belongings.Battery park - we couldn't get crown tickets these have to be booked 3 months in advance however we did pedestal tickets not worth it, you can get good photos from the ferry, make sure you are on the right hand side of the ferry top deck as it leaves port.Ellis island brilliant to walk around.All our tickets we booked on line before we went.We also had tickets for Wicked on Broadway fabulous show, loved it. Theatre was new and lovely.Bubba Gump, Times Square we went twice service excellent and if you buy certain drinks they give you a glass to take home which is great.Great Irish restaurants 5 mins from hotel, Connollys excellent food and service.Alcohol in New York is very expensive in bars, more than London prices.Taxi to and from the airport is one set price which is handy, just then decide what tip to give.Hotel will call a taxi for you when you leave, they also store your bags secure. Rooms in hotel clean and quite spacious too, bathroom had huge rainfall shower, there is a fridge in your room, if you want a kettle ask them at reception no problem, we made a cup of tea every morning which was nice. They will give you tea bags too.Breakfast we ate out, fabulous place Red Flame diner - out of hotel turn left on the corner turn left passed Wells Fargo and Duanes, next corner turn left its about 2 doors down on your left you can get cereal toast full cooked breakfast muffins pancakes etc melon strawberries, basically as light or heavy a breakfast. They also give you tap water and you can drink water in New York without getting a dodgy belly which I didn't know quite handy!Hotel reception staff can not do enough to help they even checked us in online for our flights home. Very friendly staff happy to give directions and they told us about the subway, so easy to use.I loved Times Square and the location of hotel is excellent just minutes on foot.Shopping if they have sales is good value otherwise we found some things more expensive so make sure you work it out in STG before you buy.

But there were a bunch of small things that really stole the comfort from my stay. First, I expect an iron and ironing board in the room (there wasn't one), but when I called down for one, it took 30 minutes for them to bring it to me (frustrating for a business traveler w a schedule to keep). Additionally, I expected a queen size bed, what I got was full size. At 6'2"", my feet were hanging off the end of the bed. Room service after 7 pm doesn't exist either (FYI); plan accordingly. On a positive note, the hotel bath/shower was great and clean. ","Chicago, Illinois","christrunner</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",3,3.0

There's also several cafes and restaurants, including Starbucks and Chipotle right on the same block. The staff are super down to earth, friendly and helpful (shout out to Ron and Adam).

The room was great, the bed was sooooo comfortable and we loved the shower and added touch of the slippers and bath robes. We were on the 24th floor and we could see a corner of times square from our window. On our last day we had brunch at Butter which i was super excited about given that celebrity chef Alex Guarneschelli is head chef. She wasn't there unfortunately but the food was awesome and we got free champagne for my boyfriend's birthday. I had the french toast and he had the omelet and for dessert we shared the strawberry beignets (which were heavenly).

Rather than just taking my word for it (that I was who I said I was) and sending me back up to the room with a new key card, they had a hotel security officer (plain clothed) escort me to my room to check my ID.

One drawback, being an older space that was most likely bought and converted, the room still has an older-style heating and cooling system next to the room doorway. So every time it kicked on and off it made a loud rattling noise that sounded as if someone were shaking the hotel door (a very unnerving way to be jolted awake throughout the night). In addition, some of the service crew were in the hallway having a fairly loud conversation about their shift hours at 3:45 in the morning; again, not a great way to be woken up.

Throughout our stay whether asking for directions or just passing while entering or exiting the hotel the staff were always polite friendly and asked if we needed anything.

While they bill themselves as a boutique hotel, it's really a mix of hotel floors with corporate housing/extended stay floors, which I think is about 50/50. The rooms are very small, but the property is extremely clean and floors are whisper quiet. Location/General Upkeep: 4/5 - Good midtown location near eats, theaters, subway stations. The lobby is very narrow and you must walk through the small check-in line area to access the elevator bay. It was crowded when I checked in at 4pm on a weekday with one desk agent working. It was about a 15 minutes from the time I walked in the door until I was in my room. Staff Attentiveness: 4/5 - Bellhop was great hailing cabs, assisting with luggage, but because there aren't a large volume of guests (I assume) so sometimes the front desk was unmanned or the service line, when called from the room, went unanswered. Could've been a fluke during my stay, but I didn't get the sense that the amount of desk staff was adequate. Room Appointments:4/5 - The beds and bedside are very low to the ground, and the room was very small - I was alone but would've been super tight with a partner simply because the space for a second suitcase just isn't there. The bathroom was a good size when compared to the proportion of the room - shower had good pressure. I never saw or heard another person on my floor - it was very quiet. Ancillary Services: 5/5 - Housekeeping was consistent, there's a fancy restaurant kind of below the lobby (you can oversee it through a glass partition by the elevators bays) which was great but very pricey. Elevators: 2/5 - There were only 2 elevators and during my stay one was down for maintenance. This resulted in housekeeping/room service/hotel staff competing for elevator time with hotel guests and the longer-term residents. It was definitely slow at times, but they should have another way to divert the operational traffic in such an instance, as perhaps the service elevator (guessing there is one) was down as well.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","mattm54</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",27,4.0

And the bonus is that it's set back enough off of Times Square that you don't feel the madness that is that part of town.

Everything looked brand new. - Well suited for business travel--desk and lots of easily accessible outlets.- Located very close to Times Square (and Bryant Park, one of my favorite places)- Staff was very friendly.- I love the stall shower with no tub! Really, more business hotels should do this. Tubs are gross and who uses them other than families with kids (which this hotel is definitely not geared towards).Cons:- Rooms are small and I think they only have double beds. As a solo traveler this was fine, but if I were traveling with my husband, this would never have worked for us. - Fitness center debacle: The hotel doesn't have a fitness center, so they have contracted with Equinox Gym, a couple of blocks away, for guests to use. Which would be okay--not great, but okay--except that there is a hotel directory in your room that says the fitness center is on tenth floor. There is a little sticker on the inside of your keycard holder that mentions the Equinox but 1) it doesn't say anything about the fitness center on the 10th floor no longer being available, it sounds the Equinox is an extra alternative and 2) who looks in the keycard holder for information about the fitness center? That's what the hotel directory is for. So the note in the keycard holder is basically just an out for the staff to say you were told about the fitness center when you wake up an hour early to work out and realize that you really needed to wake up an hour and 20 minutes early and now aren't going to be able work out or go back to sleep. That's the sort of thing that gets your TripAdvisor review downgraded by at least a point.- The hotel doesn't really have any sort of lobby to speak of. I had to make a phone call after I checked out and normally this is something I would do from a quiet spot in the hotel lobby, but not at this hotel.- The restaurant in the hotel is very hip and trendy and popular. Which you would think would be a positive but what it means is that, as a solo traveler, you are going to have to find someplace else to eat (and if you aren't a solo traveler, I'm not sure this is the hotel for you). Likewise if you just want to have a glass of wine at the end of a long day of travel/meetings.","Fremont, California","Barbara B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fremont, California</strong>",10,3.0

The rooms are tastefully decorated & spotlessly clean, and actually a very good size for NYC! In the room there was a safe, a fridge for guests to store their own drink's /food's, huge dressing mirror, enormous television and the most comfortable bed with amazing pillows. The bathroom had ample amounts of towels, including dressing gowns and a nice selection of toiletries should you need them and again was spotless clean. The rooms are serviced on a daily basis and look immaculate for your return. We had several packages sent to the hotel which they were more than happy to accept for us. On a rainy day the hotel had enough umbrella's for all guests to head out into the city. The reception team greeted you every time you entered or left the hotel, it truly felt like we were part of the furniture in no time. We didn't eat in the restaurant as we often ate late, however, it always has a buzz about it and from what I could see was reasonably priced for the area the hotel is in. We truly have nothing but praise for the hotel and the staff, from the door man who ran into the busy Manhattan streets at anytime to hail you a cab to the charming chamber maids who always took time to say hello everyone TRULY makes you feel welcome.

From the perspective of the young adventure traveler, rooms are sleek, modern and cool. But from the perspective of a seasoned traveler, they're sparse, under-furnished and inspired by IKEA. Even upgraded rooms have one chair, no dresser, no iron, and limited size. Even more: the hotel has no lobby or common areas to reader or entertain guests. In the end, it's just another basic hotel in midtown Manhattan-- overly priced by normal standards. The hotel has multiple residence floors, and is well-managed, clean and secure. It's location is central and easily accessible by taxi, foot, subway or walking.

Excellent quality throughout its minimalist, tastefully done design. Great bathroom, quality accoutrements and bathrobes. Large windows for natural light and (rooftop, in my case) Manhattan views, if so desired. Great staff, all friendly and helpful, despite “cool” appearance that often is harbinger of bad attitudes.

It's sort of a hole in the wall without a regular lobby, but there are a couple of chairs near the front desk that will do in a pinch.My room was very quiet -- hardly any outside noise can be heard.

The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean, except for what I've noted below.The small room was mostly filled by the king bed and a small desk with an office chair. There were nightstands on each side of the bed with working lights. There was an electrical outlet on one side of the bed, but it did not work. The electrical outlets on the desk worked. The bathroom was a comfortable size with an excellent, roomy shower. The closet was a small but adequate cupboard.One afternoon I returned to the room about 4:30 p.m. (after being out most of the day) and the maid had just begun cleaning the room. Ugh. I had to go outside and walk around while she finished, and then she didn't clean the shower, perhaps because I had interrupted her and she felt hurried. I was there three nights and the maid never did replace depleted soaps or shampoos, etc.The room had a good-sized TV -- and a radio with an iPhone/iPod connection, but the connector is for an older generation iPhone 4.

The lobby is a little drab, but who really cares about hanging out in the lobby of the hotel. Now, when you get on the elevators, the lights are extremely dim. Almost to the extent of being in the dark. Very odd. One week prior to arrival I emailed the hotel to ask about a pre-arrival bottle of champagne to have in the room to kick off our little girls trip. I was emailed back by Jasmine, who said of course that could be done and included a form for me to fill out which item I would like. She also needed a copy of my ID and debit card. I promptly filled out everything, made copies and sent back to her. I heard nothing back.....nothing. I emailed her several times and still nothing. Upon arrival, I did not want to say anything at the desk, hoping the champagne would be in the room. I was wrong. Needless to say I was disappointed.

The location is great if you want to be Midtown. Personally I prefer the Village or Chelsea, so this location is not ideal for me, but a good deal on booking.com made me want to try this hotel anyway.I had requested a quiet room located as high up in the building as possible. My room was on the 21st floor, which is only halfway to the top of this tall structure, but it was high enough for me, and more importantly, the room was very quiet. That in combination with a heavenly bed meant I slept like a baby. The room was big enough for one person and kept nice and clean though some of the furniture looked a little worn. The waterfall shower in the bathroom was divine. Wifi was free but on the weak side. Closet space was limited but sufficient for one person for such a short stay. Elevators are fast but ridiculously dark (you almost need a flashlight to see which button to press) and make an annoying beeping sound for each floor they pass that can be heard from your room.The so called fitness room on the 10th floor has very limited equipment and looked messy and cluttered, which is why I chose not to make use of it. The terrace on the same floor was closed, unclear why. Breakfast is USD22 and did not look worth the price, a very small buffet in the restaurant in the basement, so I did not try that.As far as customer service and staff attitude go the bellboy was the only staff member who made the smallest attempt of being friendly, smiling etc - the rest of the staff in the small and somewhat cluttered lobby seemed aloof and disinterested. Not a smile, not a ""thank you for staying with us"" upon check-out, nothing. They seemed to be mostly preoccupied talking among themselves rather than focusing on the guests that they are there to provide service to.All in all a decent but not great and somewhat impersonal hotel with some improvement to do as far as service and certain details go, but which will work fine for a short stay if you want to be Midtown.","Stockholm, Sweden","Larshie_B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",51,3.0

They were really helpful in arranging shows, and organising trips. On our last day they extended our check out time slightly and also held our bags free of charge! We went out and did some shopping came back then dropped it off with our cases and went back out again with no problems. All staff are so friendly and helpful, always said hello and gave a smile!

After our five nights here we were very glad we chose here, having thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The downsides? There is very little in the way of a hotel lobby or lounge, so if you are looking for the sort of hotel to relax and enjoy the amenities of a lobby/cafe sort of area, then this probably isnt the hotel for you. Other downside was the small size of the room, though to be fair we actually booked the smallest sized room to keep costs down, so only really have ourselves to blame. The room was fine for a single occupier, but if travelling as a couple I would definitely suggest going for a larger room!Upsides? Room was tastefully decorated and nice and modern. There was a huge TV, very nice bathroom with walk in shower, and a good ipod dock system. The location was absolutely perfect for exploring midtown and beyond on foot. It's a busy and potentially noisy area, but up on the 21st floor where our room was we were pretty well insulated from all the hustle and bustle of Time Square/Theatre District. Finally, the biggest upside was the quality of the service. From the check in process to getting us a taxi on our return to the airport and everything in between, the staff were falling over themselves to help us out. Every member of staff we came across was great, but special mention goes to Lendel (I think that was his name?!) who checked us in. He even provided us with a free bottle of prosecco for no reason other than it was our first night in New York!Overall the hotel exceeded expectations, and i would recommend to anyone looking for a central base from which to explore Manhattan.

We stayed previously on 43rd & 3rd Avenue which proved a great hotel but a little further away from Times Square than we wanted. We arrived at JFK and got the NYC Aiport Bus Service from the taxi rank which dropped us at Port Authority - from there was a 10 minute walk with luggage to the hotel. Really we could have got off at Times Square but I don't think the walk would have been any different. It's a good idea to learn a little about how the streets & Avenue's work in NYC before making the journey - streets are in ascending order from South to North. Avenue's are in ascending order from East to West so it's really easy to find yourself and get to where you need to be.Hotel Cassa is well located, only two blocks east of Times Square on quite a quiet street. Nearby there is a couple of coffee houses, and many restaurants. Everything for us have been within walking distance, including 5th Avenue, Rockefeller Centre (a must see as we didn't go a few years ago), Empire State Building. The subway is also only a 10 minute walk to help you get downtown / Brooklyn Bridge if you don't want to take the walk.We've had a deluxe room while being here - the bathroom is spacious (although the door is wide and so you can't swing it past the sink). Our room has a large King Size bed, a 42"" TV with all channels & fridge. No iron unfortunately but we didn't ask if one was available from the front desk so I've been in T Shirts all week. We had breakfast included in our room and is available from 'Butter' restaurant downstairs which is your typical american breakfast.All in all, a great trip, complimented by the hotel and it's great location. WiFi provided in room for free (just make sure your package includes it - otherwise it's $15 per day).","Little Waltham, United Kingdom","dawsjam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Little Waltham, United Kingdom</strong>",15,4.0

Check in was perfunctory and my first impressions were coloured by this. However, the room itself was lovely if on the small side. In particular the lack of wardrobe space for coats/dresses was an issue. The bathroom was nice and the room was very clean. Wifi was free and consistent. The bellboy came up with our luggage and he was really nice - he gave us some advice on the local area and he was really helpful throughout our stay as were the other staff on the front desk (aside from the first day). The location was fabulous, walking distance to most of the main attractions and close to the subway. The room was on the 6th floor and overlooked the street and it was pretty noisy at night with refuse trucks and taxi horns. The heating was very noisy too but it heated the room up fabulously.

The first time I came to NYC I stayed in the Wellington Hotel in the middle of summer and their A/C stopped working - so I figured I would give this hotel a shot.It has a perfect location. It is very close to a couple of different subway stations. You can get just about anywhere via the subway in a matter of minutes (I would recommend downloading a subway app on your phone - it tells you all the different train routes and times, and the apps are usually free). Also, this hotel is only a couple of blocks from Rockefeller Center (which has public bathrooms downstairs - unlike many places around there). As an added bonus, there is a Duane Reed store right around the corner (the northeast's version of Walgreens or CVS). That makes it very easy to go grab some beer or snacks to keep in your hotel room.The room itself was pretty small. It wasn't tiny, but still small. There was still enough room to put your bags and belongings, but you just have to make sure that you are organized about how you put your things. I'm sometimes pretty messy, which made it harder. But if you don't just throw your stuff in there, there's plenty of room to walk around and hang out. My fiancee and I had plenty of room to ""pre-drink,"" listen to music on the ipod dock, and hang out before going out for a night on the town.The bed was extremely comfortable. Almost too comfortable, especially when you're drained from a full day of walking around New York. Make sure you set an alarm in the morning if you don't want to risk sleeping in and wasting part of your day. The bathroom was pretty nice. The best part was the glass walk-in shower with really good water pressure. #1 important thing: get out of the hotel and explore the thousands of restaurants and shops that are nearby. Also, don't just hang around Times Square. Get a subway pass and ride unlimited rides all over the city (they are like $30 for a weeks pass). There are several places around the city that offer rooftop, outdoor bars that provide a wonderful view of the city. I love reading reviews on here of people complaining about the most trivial things. Don't go to New York City if you are wanting to just sit in your hotel and whine the whole time about how the cleaning staff didn't come up and clean up the mess that YOU made the night before. Your hotel in New York should serve its purpose as an adequate place to sleep after you spent all day out exploring the city.

The 2 BR 2 bath condo was very clean but is showing some wear. It was perfect for our needs. Just a block off of Times Square in the heart of Manhattan. The only thing I would say is that there was no lobby and no way to get bottled water or even a soda. There are plenty of places nearby, but with most of them closed on NYD, it is worth mentioning.

If you can get a good price, I would recommend this hotel even though we had a less than perfect stay. The location is great for tourists. It was our first time in New York, so the central location worked in our favor. Next time, we will find a less busy location away from the chaos.We got a great price on a Junior Suite through a Cyber Monday deal. The room was spacious. The bathroom was also large with double sinks and a bathtub. The bed was comfortable. There was a lack of storage space for clothes. We had to leave most items in our suitcases. We spent a lot of time in our room at the beginning of the trip due to illness, so we appreciated the space and comfortable bed.The lobby is small with just a front desk and a few chairs, so if you are looking for a gathering place, you will not find it here. The elevators were fast and we never had to wait for one. There was a room for a business center on the 10th floor but it must have been under construction during our stay because the room was empty.Unfortunately, we ran into some problems. On our third night, I was woken up by a very loud vibrating noise that sounded like someone was buffing/sanding the floor above us. It was 2am and the noise continued. It was really loud. I called down to the front desk and they sent a maintenance man up within 10 minutes. Within those 10 minutes, we figured out it was the heating system, which was confusing to us since we had been in the room for three days and never heard this noise. The maintenance man confirmed it was the heating system. His solution was ""it's not very cold outside, so you should just turn off the heat."" This was his solution? Just turn off the heat?!?!? He had no explanation as to why we didn't hear this noise before. It is still a mystery. There was no follow-up from the front desk regarding this problem.We also didn't receive housekeeping services for two days. The first time, we assumed it was our own fault since we spent time in our room watching a football game during the prime cleaning time and kept up our ""Do Not Disturb"" sign. That was fine with us. But we returned to our room the next day in the early evening, and it was still not cleaned. After two days, this was not acceptable. We got ready for dinner and then talked to the front desk on our way out. They almost made it seem like it was our fault. Basically, ""well why didn't you let us know after the first time?"". Sorry, but housekeeping is a basic service at a hotel, so this is not our fault! We went to dinner and came back to an uncleaned room with stack of new towels (all dirty towels still on the floor of the bathroom). Later, we received a letter from the hotel slipped under our door with a voucher for breakfast the next morning. (Do not pay for this breakfast. It is a small selection of foods. Not worth the price). A gross breakfast did not make up for the problems we encountered.On a positive note, we had a drink at the bar in Butter (restaurant downstairs). It is a beautiful space. The bartender was very friendly, and the drinks were enjoyable.Neighborhood recommendations: Pizza from Little Italy Pizza across the street from the hotel was really good! We did happy hour at a bar called Point Break down the street. Friendly bartenders and cheap drink prices. There is a Duane Reade(Walgreens) right around the corner on 6th for supplies. Their prices were cheaper than other stores in the area.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin","KellyW695</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milwaukee, Wisconsin</strong>",26,3.0

We booked through Priceline Express for a fair price. The hotel is well located between 5th and 6th Avenues, about a 10 minute walk from Times Square and with plenty of food choices nearby. It is one of the new, very tall, very skinny side street Manhattan hotels - something like 50 stories. Our room on the 11th floor was available before check-in time on Christmas Day. The front desk staff was efficient and very friendly; they smiled and said hello when we left and when we returned. They can be quite busy at peak hours. The size of our room was okay, especially for New York. The bathroom was huge with a large rainfall shower. However, some of this space might be used better in the room itself, which had one small closet and little drawer space - we had to leave both of our suitcases in the room, one on the folding stand that is stored in the closet (the closet isn't big enough to hold the stand once it's unfolded) and the other on the small desk that also holds the phone. The bed was very comfortable but note that our standard room had only a full size, not a queen. The staff will provide a rollaway if you need it. The hotel restaurant (Butter - separately reviewed) was not reliable, and I predict it won't last.- in fact, the word ""Alex"" appears under its name on the outdoor window.

Rooms, common space, and bathrooms were very clean and kept that way at all times. Decor was modern and simple. WIFI was included and actually worked unlike many hotels. The staff was overwhelmingly nice and accommodating. We had an issue with our heat and when i opened our door, there happened to be a staff on the floor and I enquired about the thermostat and he immediately called and got someone to look at it. We asked for a corkscrew for some wine and immediately someone came up to the room to drop it off. Couldn't have asked for more attentive service. At checkin they warned us about some noise but it only lasted an hour or so and then not to be heard again the rest of our stay.

I normally don't choose a modern boutique hotel for many focus on style rather than service, this one has done well in both. Cassa is just one block from Times Square and a few minutes walk to 5th Ave, on the quiet part of 45th St.. The hotel is near to many theaters, a few blocks from Bryant Park with a number of good cafes. There is a Pret a Manger almost next door and a drug store a few minutes walk. There is even a lovely garden to sit and relax next to the opposite building. A special note to nostalgists, there is a large old store which sells everything from Halloween costumes and candies to pots and pans and socks, towels, etc. at the opposite side of the street!The rooms are relatively small, probably NYC standard, but very well decorated, clean and efficient. The bathroom in the Queen room has an extra space with mirror away from the sink area for convenience of hair and makeup, love it. The easy chair with its foot rest was great to sit & relax by the end of a long day.The room lighting maybe a little dim as most are task lights, but not a problem. Never have to wait long for the elevators, 4 in total. The only problem was we heard some noises from the street up to our 7th floor room, later found out the window could not be closed properly, fortunately it is a relatively quiet area, we forgot to tell the staffs. Later when I moved to a single room at the back, all was nice and quiet.Service is great, both the Front desk staffs and the porters are very friendly. We felt very welcome during our stay. Special thanks to Adil, the young porter, who not only helped with the luggage but also enthusiastically help me to avoid the traffic at the front of the hotel at rush hour upon check-out.I had very good price for the queen room(about $300/night), but with the single which I booked much later- I find it quite expensive (almost $400), but then it evened out.

He did a good job with this one. It wasn't cheap for our 5 night stay, it is Manhattan after all, but it was pretty reasonable for a hotel that could hardly have been more central. Everything you could have wanted was close by. On West 45th Street between 5th and 6th Avenue, it was a 5 minute walk to Times Square, 10 minutes to the Empire State Building and Rockefeller Centre, 10 minutes to the theatre where we saw Cabaret. 5th Avenue and its classy shops is literally round the corner. The longest walk we did was to Central Park, and that was only 12 blocks,We only took the subway once, to the Brooklyn Bridge and the Supreme Court (my wife loves the show Law and Order and wanted photos of her standing on the famous steps!) and that was more a matter of time saving than distance.The hotel itself is fairly small and so are the standard rooms, although they are nicely appointed and realistically you won't be wanting to do much more than sleep there anyway. Every member of staff we met was really polite, and couldn't do enough for you.The block itself has restaurants, bars, shops, delis and diners. Our favourite breakfast place was Cafe Manhattan over the road ($3 for an egg and bacon roll, $5 for a breakfast burrito), favourite pizza place was Little Italy, again just over the road ($3 to $4 for a huge slice of pizza, $6 for an excellent calzone and $4 for a glass of wine when it is upwards of $8 elsewhere)., The bar we kept going back to was Point Break which is about 100 yards right out of the hotel. Happy Hour is 5 till 7 when draft beer is $4 compared to the usual $7 or $8, although naturally it is heaving from 4:55 to 7:15pm. I wouldn't recommend the 'British' pub The Cock and Bull. The staff were pretty rude, and I got my $5.50 change from a $24.50 bill slammed onto the bar without the barman even looking at me because I had the nerve to wait for the change (we'd been advised a dollar a drink was the norm so in this case $3). I should add that, without exception, the staff who served us in other bars, restaurants etc during our trip were friendly and welcoming. The patrons too, come to that.We didn't use the Cassa restaurant (Butters), but the prices were comparable to other meals we had during our trip. I was outside waiting for the rest of the group one night and looking at the menu when a middle-aged couple came out and told me they had just enjoyed a fantastic meal and urged me to try it. Next time maybe.There was a terrace on floor 10 that only we seemed to use. It overlooks a busy street and faces a big office building, so don't expect privacy, but it was a nice spot to sit and relax.The only negative for me was that even residents could not get a drink in the Cassa bar after 11pm. We tried once, after returning to the hotel at 11:05pm after a long and tiring day and wanting a drink or two before bed, to be told that they had cashed up and couldn't help us.

My most recent stay was this Sept 2014. The Cassa is a great find in Midtown. It is a boutique style hotel centrally located on 45th between 5th & 6th, which makes walking to the shops on 5th Ave or to Times Square very easy.The hotel has an intimate and unassuming lobby which I love but if you are looking for a grand, bustling lobby area this is not the place. The staff are some of the most friendly, professional and accommodating that I have come across at any hotel! The rooms are contemporary in design and a decent size for New York. Not as small as some other boutique hotels but not huge either. They definitely have all of the amenities of a high caliber hotel. There were doing some renovations and updates during my last stay in September however they did not affect my stay in any way. I like the fact that they maintain the hotel! My one negative comment would be the hallways - they are a bit dark and not so attractive but they were re-painting them and the hotel has so many other good features that it really does not matter.If you are looking for a great boutique hotel in midtown Manhattan for a very competitive price this is your place.

We did lots of research on hotels, and finally decided on this one because of the location and positive reviews here on Tripadvisor. We were thrilled with the location---within quick walking distance to main attractions like Times Square, theaters, Rockerfeller Plaza, etc., but also far enough from the maddening crowds that we weren't bothered by the street noise. So, if location is important, this hotel is perfect! We were very pleased with our room. For NYC, we found it to be spacious (we had an executive king, upgraded from a standard queen), great flat screen TV built in, nice bathroom and big shower, closet space, comfortable bed with good linens, and ""leather"" (not sure) chairs and ottoman. The only slight negative was that the hotel is in the process of renovating some floors. The renovation didn't bother us a bit but the art work was missing from our room which left it a bit empty looking. The elevators were fast and easy to call. No waiting at all! The most positive aspect of this hotel is what others here have been raving about: They have an AMAZING STAFF!!! Every person we came in contact with was friendly, helpful, and efficient to the max. Two examples: Upon arrival and after checking us in quickly, the desk clerk personally introduced us to the concierge which I thought was a nice touch. Also, when we asked one evening how to get to the upstairs bar for Butter the restaurant, he left his busy desk to personally escort us to the bar. I travel extensively for business, and this might be the best consistently great service I've ever experienced!

My wife and I had booked a room at the Cassa through bookit.com and we were thrilled to find out that we got a great deal on a newly renovated room so close to Times Square. After walking from Penn Station with our luggage in tow taking several wrong turns (new in town and all that) we arrived at the Cassa Hotel on W45th. To our dismay we discovered, with very little help from the concierge desk, that there is in fact another Cassa Hotel and Residences on 9th Ave, corner of W39th! The young man and young woman at the concierge desk claimed to know next to nothing about the 9th Ave location and acted like we were pulling teeth just to give out the address. We asked politely if they could provide us with the phone number but the young woman was too busy paying for her Chinese food delivery and the young man was just too much of a snob to look at us. We finally found our way to the 9th Ave location where we were treated with courtesy and respect. Bottom line, the 45th St Cassa hotel is staffed with elitist snobs and not worth the time. If you want to get treated like you are a welcome guest I highly recommend the 9th Ave location and avoid 45th altogether!

The hotel is about 2-3 blocks from the theater district and close to some great restaurants and shopping so this jaded local actually felt a little like a spoiled tourist for a change. The room we got was a standard double but was much larger then I had expected. The front door actually opens all the way without hitting a bed, a desk or my shins!

As a note, I enjoy clinical when it comes to bathrooms so this is a good thing! The bath is very clean and the rain shower adds a luxurious touch.The only things I found wrong were that there was no shelf in the shower to rest your products, so practice your juggling before you arrive.

We were in New York as part of a family vacation, and were booked into two junior suites at the Cassa hotel for 4 nights (rooms 405 and 406).First off, getting our two cars handed off for valet parking was a hassle in itself. The process was disorganized, the staff outside (although courteous and polite) misplaced our valet ticket which caused some issues at the check-in desk, however we were told that the matter would be sorted and that a replacement valet ticket would be sent up to our room. We excused the matter, as it was quite understandable; this stuff is bound to happen when valet receives hotel guests at the side of a busy road. The replacement valet ticket was not sent up to our room, no big deal, we picked it up on our way out for dinner about 3 hours after we had checked in.When making the reservation, we were told that booking junior suites rather than the deluxe or executive rooms would mean that we would have sufficient living area for two adults and one child per room. Boy were we duped. The room was so cramped that not even the minimalist contemporary design concept could distract from the fact that it was the size of a shoe box, the closet space was barely large enough to accommodate the wardrobe of a Barbie doll much less three people, and there was no room for a roll-away bed meaning that someone would have to sleep on the couch. In addition to that, the lighting was so abhorrent, I would even go far enough to say it was non-existent. Aside from two very dim hanging lights from either side of the bed (which by the way look like lampshades hung from floss by a kindergartner- but hey, I guess it's a design choice), and a desk lamp, the room was virtually a cave. There was no natural light entering the room either, as our view was an enclosed terrace with a bar/seating area (which was very noisy at night), several aircon units on a rooftop, and a wall. The bathroom (which had no lock) however, had great lighting, but this posed as an issue due to the contrast between the darkness of the room (especially with all the lights off at night) and the brightness of the bathroom, which could really make your eyes ache.To add to that, the tv was three quarters the size of the bed which seemed quite ridiculous given the fact that there was barely a foot of floorspace between it and the bed. Priorities need to be rethought, to be frank. A 50-inch tv seems to be an extraneous amenity when there's barely any lighting, and no complimentary beverages of any kind. There were two bottles of Fiji by the bed ($6 each, seriously?), a Keurig with a single mug, some tea bags, and an empty fridge.The AC worked well, but was pretty loud and kept me up past 1:30 in the morning as I couldn't block out the noise. The wall outlets were in the most inconvenient of places, the ones in the desk were embedded into it so that you could not fit an adapter onto them in order to use cables that did not fit onto US sockets, which is a bummer if you're traveling internationally. There were no outlets by the bedside, and one of the sockets by the couch did not work. To be honest, I was quite shocked with my experience at Cassa Hotel as the majority of the reviews I had looked at on tripadvisor prior to booking my stay were glowing and full of encouragements. So I came back onto the website and changed my search settings to show the worst reviews first rather than have them sorted by date. To add to my initial shock, I learnt that some of the issues have persisted since 2010 (the lighting and AC noises in particular), and that in addition to my gripes, there were several complaints from reviewers stating that staff was rude. Although I did not personally experience impolite staff, reading through the replies that management had left on previous negative reviews made me cringe. It seemed to me that rather than apologizing for their misgivings, management would constantly attempt to defend the hotel and its so called quirks. The only thing worse than management that cannot accept criticism, is management that responds to criticism in a snobby and arrogant manner. At some point reviewers were called ""petty"" and ""juvenile"" by management which doesn't seem like an appropriate response from a supposedly 4-star hotel. This almost discouraged me from writing a negative review, but here I am expressing my disappointment. Cassa hotel is definitely not worth its exuberant cost (we paid a rate of $411 per night including tax), and I would not recommend it to anyone. Its only perk is its location, as it provided a quick escape into the city and away from the cramped and dimly lit rooms. ",,RayyanHisham,15,2.0

Both were fantastic and contributed to a fun weekend. The location is amazing. We were close to everything, including Times Square, without being in the middle of it all. We could walk anywhere in the greatest city in the world from this central location. The accommodations were clean and comfortable. Our room overlooked a very cute courtyard as part of the Butter Restaurant so it felt like we were in a small city when we looked out the window but there we were in the heart of New York. The rooms are definitely on the smaller side but not too bad and the bathrooms made up for it with a spacious area and up-to-date and trendy fixtures and overall design. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They called the room 10 minutes after I checked in to see how everything was and when I arrived to the hotel they actually offered an early check in. They really cared about our comfort there and everyone was proactive in trying to anticipate our needs without being pushy about it. Just an outstanding staff all around. They should all be commended for making this such a great experience. We don't usually stay at the hotel restaurant but planned it this way because we really wanted to experience Butter. It was a great restaurant. The space was comfortable and trendy without being over the top. We were seated at a large comfortable booth in the center of the restaurant and just loved the location. The waitstaff was incredibly helpful and accommodating. Overall a great time. Even with the name Butter we found healthy choices (except for that amazing and delicious beignet! wow!).

Despite our room being on the street side, this is not a busy road and we found it very quiet at night (though being so far away from the road will definitely have helped!).The room was larger than we expected, with a Queen sized bed, two chairs, large flatscreen television, small fridge, safe, iron and board, hairdryer, lovely clean white towels and a gorgeous looking white cube-shaped radio. The storage space for clothing is limited, though there were plenty of hangars. Decorated in shades of cream and green, this presented as a lovely modern room. The clean and contemporary tiled bathroom contained a large shower (with great temperatures that didn't falter), sink with mixer tap and British 'water saving' style of toilet. The only negative I can pick out here is that as the hotel has chosen white enamel style bathroom accessories, these had a fair few chips out of the edges (bound to happen when in contact with stone and hard materials) which detracted ever-so-slightly from the overall finish.The staff we encountered here were friendly, polite and seemed happy to please. We had a slight problem with the keycard access to our room - though on the way to reception to ask for help, we met the maintenance man. We didn't even make it to the reception as he came straight back up to the 26th floor with us and tested the cards out. It seems the readers can be a bit fussy - Make sure to press your keycard to the right hand side of the reader on pulling it out!

We found this hotel online in 2012 because the price was amazing for what we could get (big room, quality linens, it looked very clean in the pictures, and it had all the amenities you expect from a good hotel) and it was about a block and a half away from Times Square, so a safe walk home after shows. Well the hotel was and is AMAZING so much so that we did not consider any other property on our most recent stay in July 2014. I have stayed in many hotels in NYC and the Cassa Hotel by far surpasses them all in comfort (great AC and plush beds) for the price and location. Safe area between 5th and 6th avenues and steps away from Rockafeller Center, Grand Central Station, New York Public Libray, shopping, Bryant Park, etc etc. and there are great restaurants in the neighborhood and one connected to the hotel! There are only 8 rooms per floor - it is as quiet as can be - you don't even know there is anyone else there and hardly any traffic noise at all in the rooms. CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN. Unbelievably clean and the staff is so friendly. They greeted us BY NAME every morning as we left and welcomed us back upon all our returns throughout our stay. The wonderful iced tea in the afternoon and great coffee in the morning in the lobby is an added bonus. Their packages online are very reasonable and they are very good communicating with you about your upcoming stay. Again, I would not look anywhere else WHEN TRAVELLING TO NYC and I hope they continue to keep up their quality as this is a home away from home for me and my friends when we travel to the big apple.","Corpus Christi, Texas","DLY1947</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Corpus Christi, Texas</strong>",6,5.0

Our goal was to find the most affordable yet modern hotel near Times Square. In this regard I feel that Cassa is a great value. With limited time it was important that we be close to the action (tourist action anyway). The hotel is one and a half blocks east and two blocks north of Times Square. Even with the long city blocks in Manhattan, the walk doesn’t seem long at all because of how much action there is in that area. The service was on par with an establishment of this price point and location. The room was well appointed, clean, modern, and comfortable. While the room was very small, the bathroom was bright and spacious. Unfortunately I can’t recall our room number but it was an interior facing room. Our view was of the backs of other buildings and the patio of the restaurant below, which is located in the basement of the hotel. In general, some pros, cons, and observations:- The window does not open all the way. The photo attached shows the widest it will open.- The 10th floor lounge opens into an adjoining terrace that overlooks W. 45th Street. We never used it for anything but it appears to be a relaxing space. There is also a restroom available on that floor.- There is a Pret A Manger next door which offers coffees, juices, sandwiches, and breakfast items at good quality and prices, a welcome relief from the high prices in that part of town. The hotel does not include breakfast with the room nor do they offer one for a charge so being next to a Pret A Manger was a big benefit.- Other pro’s: rainfall shower, large TV, quiet rooms.","San Leandro, California","khchang</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Leandro, California</strong>",101,5.0

For years I looked for a convenient but affordable, clean but spacious (for NY) hotel for my trips into the city for work. I like to stay in the heart of the city since my clients are in walking distance or a short cab ride, and then I'm also in walking distance to Time Square for dinners and entertainment at night. I've stayed at numerous locations near Time Square which can get pricy because of the tourists. However the Cassa Hotel is always affordable and offers the same amenities as all the surrounding hotels. If you've been to NY you know that space is a luxury when it comes to hotel rooms, and you're usually playing chess with your room door opening onto the desk chair or worse your bed. At Cassa I've never had an issue, from their smallest of rooms to their more spacious suites, they have found an effective yet cozy way to make each room inviting. Just note, the Cassa Hotel is a boutique hotel, meaning it's a smaller hotel without a spacious lobby for get-togethers or working lunches. The upper half of the hotel are 'owned' condos that can be rented out should you be coming with a larger family. The lobby consists of a few chairs and the check in counter, however the hotel features an amazing restaurant that opened in the last year, Butter. I believe one of the Food Network Stars is the chef, if you watch the show. Being that it's a boutique hotel, there is no room service (well none that I know of) however they have several personal items should you forget your toothpaste etc. The rooms have a small fridge, so I always buy some extra drinks and/or snacks to munch on. I'm of the belief that if you're in the city you should get dressed, walk outside and find yourself a meal since there is so much to experience, so the room service has never been an issue to me. I will definitely continue to stay at the Cassa Hotel for each of my upcoming trips for business, as well as my personal ones too. The staff is friendly and accommodating, and I couldn't imagine wanting to stay anywhere else!",,Kelly F,0,5.0

Rooms that had been confirmed and pre-paid for by us, over a week ago. The only option, said the receptionist, was to double up with my co-traveller in a room with 2 double beds, which the hotel had saved out of the goodness of their hearts. Also, the obligatory: ""we hardly ever do an overbooking"" story followed. Well, you have overbooked 100% of the times I have used your hotel, so the other stats weren't really relevant to me...so the rest of the apology was just jabber.The receptionist also made it clear that if we chose not to take this option it would take over an hour to find alternate accommodations at another hotel, and it was going to be a difficult endeavor given the lateness of the hour and the stormy weather (several flights in and out of NYC had been cancelled that evening). I would have imagined that the hotel would at least have an option ready, in the eventuality of us showing up but the bets had obviously been placed at their end on a no-show on our part.We were told we would be refunded the amount for the 2nd room that they weren't giving us...wow, imagine that...you aren't going to charge me for a service you don't provide me...thank you so much for your considerate behavior.Any how, we chose the only room available given early morning meetings. The room itself was large and comfortable. The bed was also comfortable, although the aircon vent (could not be adjusted) blew directly on my head all night and left me with a cold the next day. The bathroom, especially the shower, was large and nicely done up in cream tiles and stone. Oh Cassa, how I wished you hadn't overbooked, cause there is some real promise here.In the morning we received a hesitant note from the manager inviting us for breakfast at their restaurant...we did partake, but the pickings were meager at best...a few muffins, some juice, some fruit...I have had better, pretty much everywhere else I have stayed. Overall, a disappointing experience...especially when the facilities are so good. Our travel agent wrangled some other freebies out of management later, but I could really care less.

The perfect location really. We found that booking the Lincoln Town cabs were better then the Yellow taxi's. Reception also let us call them from their phone. They have a lovely restaurant on sight and free wifi on the 10th floor.Overall, we were completely satisfied with the price we paid for the hotel and we would defiantly stay there again.","London, United Kingdom","Jolie B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",2,5.0

There was one hiccup with our stay that was resolved by hotel staff with care and contrition. Very little street noise.

I agreed to accept and pay for any upgrade that was available thi8nking it would get us a room sooner. Despite this, our room was not available until after 3 PM and no upgrades were offered. In that same pre arrival questionnaire, it asked if we were celebrating any special occasions. I remarked that we were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. I would have expected, at least, a Happy Anniversary greeting as we checked in. During our stay not one word was mentioned of our special day. When we were finally able to get into a room, there was an envelope under our door with my name on it. Inside was a coupon to use for Continental Breakfast. Unfortunately, we stayed on a Saturday evening and the breakfast was not available on Sunday. I don't know why they bothered to give us the coupon.

I arrived early but the room I booked was not available, but the gentleman at the desk I believe his name was John assured me that the room they were giving me was a better room for my inconvenience which ranks high in my expectations of a hotel and customer service. I left my bags and went into the city to enjoy my day. When I arrived back it was a slight mix up ,not with the hotel but with a guest not checking out but I waited only a few minutes and was given the key to my room. When I walked in, I was wowed by the fantastic and spacious Jr suite. The Ll shaped couch and king sized bed was a great look. The bathroom was large with a double vanity and sink along with a bathrobe. The next morning I went downstairs and they have fresh coffee brewed and you can order breakfast from a local restaurant that delivers to the hotel and you can either eat in the room or in the lounge on the 10th floor .

This is a boutique hotel well located in mid-town - near the tourism action on Times Square as well as businesses on 5th, 6th or Madison Avenues.It's easy to miss the hotel from the street since it has a relatively discrete street presence and small lobby. I had a junior suite which was large compared to the typical hotel room in NY, although not the most efficient use of space (sitting area is between bed and bath room in a completely dark part of the suite). The room was pleasant and quiet even though I was on the 5th floor. As is common in NY, the room was quite dark because of the shadowing of surrounding buildings if you are not staying on a high floor. Wifi worked well and was complimentary with my rate. Not a lot of common areas to ""hang out"" given that the lobby is small, there is no in-hotel bar/restaurant although there is a lounge without food/drink service on the 10th floor. I did not try room service. There are plenty of restaurant options at various price points in the immediate area.Everything in the room was in working order and there is complimentary in-room coffee. The decor and hallways could use a little refresh, but certainly not a significant detraction. Front desk service was okay - not particularly engaging, empathetic or attentive. Always seem to be side conversations going on and a wait despite 2-3 staff.Overall, a nice choice in Manhattan and certainly more enjoyable than a large, chain hotel.","Chicago, Illinois","dlscps</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",71,4.0

We were very excited about visiting this hotel, as it was a change for us (had always stayed at the Blakely in past visits to NYC). Unfortunately, we were not impressed. The front desk staff seemed overwhelmed, but not because they were over-busy. The rooms were small and virtually NO CLOSET SPACE to speak of. We understand packing light, but this was a bit ridiculous! Sleeping quality was not as hoped, either. When in NYC, we need a good night's sleep for all of the adventures of the day. Breakfast was expensive and not anything to write home about. Staff didn't love their jobs up in the breakfast area, either. We also had a work meeting here. That went better, and they delivered lunch to us twice. Won't return.","Dallas, Texas","ItalophileTrav</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",96,3.0

It is located in midtown and is a convenient walking distance from Times Square, the New York Public Library, and Grand Central Station. If you bring a car, I would recommend pre-booking on the NYC parking website. The Cassa Hotel has valet service, but it is $60 plus tax per day.

As it was a last minute booking we were assigned an apartment rather than a room, which we accepted. There was no safe in the apartment and it was basic at best. To top it off the rooms were never serviced and when we reported this to reception they said the apartments were ""different"" and a service charge applied to service the room. Staff were unhelpful, unfriendly and unsympathetic in this regard. At $500 a night this is not acceptable. So for the 4 nights we stayed there we had no clean towels, no fresh linen on the bed, no top up of toiletries and the plug in the tiny bath didn't open fully so it took hours for the water to drain when taking a bath/shower.

The apartment was a bit of a disaster, but the staff of the hotel were extremely helpful, friendly and fantastic. So, we decided to stay in the hotel itself, and were somewhat happy with our experience.The room and the bathroom were great, as was the bed - very comfortable. The problem was the heating/ac. It would come on, and just grow louder and louder then quiet down only to begin again loudly. We are used to the hums of systems, but this became rather obnoxious and woke us up. We finally shut it off at 2 am and opened the window (yes and amazingly it was quieter outside). This was mentioned at checkout the next morning and they will look into it.The other issue is with communication. When we checked out at 10:30, we said we would be back between 2:30-3:00 to take a shower at the fitness center the hotel has a relationship with. Well, the fitness center closes at 3:00, this could have been communicated when we mentioned this. We thought we would have a shower after being out all day (nice mid-70s) and before boarding our overnight flight back to Europe. It was rather ackward when we returned and told the fitness center had closed and we could not shower. Now how much easier could it have been to tell us this at 10:30 in the morning before we left. Anyway, we used the sink in the lounge area, not much fun.I give this a Very Good because I am basing this review on the room itself, NYC small but nice. Great view out of the 27th Floor. Great to have internet access in the Lounge for free. Also nice to have free coffee/tea in the morning. Great products in the rather generous bathroom. Bed was comfortable. The porter was FANTASTIC, I really wish I could remember his name...he was the only one who really understood our dilemna about showering and was rather sympathetic and apologetic...thank you.Would we stay here again, not so sure. The prices of hotels in NYC are outrageous, and so this maies choosing the right hotel rather difficult, considering the minor irritants paying as much as one does they no longer seem so minor.","Ennetbaden, Switzerland","JC505</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ennetbaden, Switzerland</strong>",126,4.0

I never felt unsafe, even walking back to the hotel at night. Location was great, it is just between Times Square and 5th Ave. Whichever direction you choose, there are sights to see.

The location is superior (although the cabbie had a tough time finding it!). Very central to so much. And clean....yes! Immaculate. I was a bit worried it might be loud as the corridors are small and the rooms are close together, but it was very quiet. The view was non existent, but I get that not every side can have a good view. And while the room was pretty small (and I had a jr suite), the bathroom was quite large by comparison. Even the toiletry products are mega sized! And the staff were extremely friends, which is always great. The cons were minor, but given the price of the room, are worth mentioning. Wifi is expensive ($15/day) and was useless for my entire stay. I had better luck with the free wifi on the lounge floor, but not much. The $15/day breakfast is not worth it at all - not with so many other places two or three steps away. Oh, and the room needed more light! Even with every lamp turned on, these old eyes had a hard time seeing. And I agree that the price of water in the room is ridiculous when paying over $300 a night.

We visit NYC a few times a year and I was attending a work conference and I did not want to stay in the Disneyland Hyatt! We are HUGE fans of the Viceroy Hotel's- having hosted my 50th birthday at the one in Palm Springs. Again, expectations on my part. This is a great hotel- fantastic location and attentive staff. Unfortunately, I had expectations that weren't true or possible. No coffee in the rooms, no room service, no "" lounge"" or bar available, no ice except for calling the front desk. Not huge things but my expectation was more. Coffee is available for $4.00 on the 10th floor during their continental breakfast. However, "" to go"" cups were never available- so in the very cold ( I'm from LA)- I had to get dressed to go out of the hotel to get coffee- spoiled I guess, but again expectations. Wi-Fi is a whole different issue which I believe the hotel is addressing but it isn't convenient. Coming home from my conference I wanted a glass of wine- which becomes very difficult because the restaurant in the hotel ( very nice restaurant) isn't set up where you can order a drink and take it to your room. So, would I stay here again, yes. Now that I know what to expect- my recommendation for the hotel is to consider making coffee available, especially during the winter in some form other than the 10th floor and if that isn't possible- it should be comp'd and to go cups available.",los angeles,"minimikey</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>los angeles</strong>",36,4.0

Kudos to Alicia who handle the critical water crisis at night by herself. And Jonathan and Emilio who provided excellent bellman support and provided logistical support in and outside of the Cassa. I really appreciated the team atmosphere and detailed customer support, which is what my interest is in for Customer and Quality Management.

The most remarkable thing: Location is really amazing if you want to stay at Times Square area. The hotel is located to only one block and a half of 45th st and 7th Av (that is exactly the heart of Times Square). Some positive points: We received an upgrade from the triple room to a junior suite in the 6th floor. The sleeping quality (bed, pillows…) is almost perfect except for the annoying noise of the heater. The bathroom is big, modern and the shower is really great. I want to mention some members of the staff who had been remarkably helpful and kind: Hector (Maintenance) and Miguel (front door).The negative ones: Free wifi is only available at Floor #10. When you pay more than $550 a night you expect a service above standard. Rooms are small as you expect in Manhattan. The reception area is too small (we arrived early and the only option was waiting for the check in time at floor#10). Nobody seemed to do any additional effort to accelerate the check in process: we arrived in the hotel at 8AM and we had to wait till 3PM exactly to get our room.

The amenities were very nice. The hotel room was clean and spacious (at least by NY standards). The hotel staff were extremely nice and accommodating. Free Wi-Fi was included in the stay which is a nice bonus. There were only a couple of things I could suggest to improve the stay. The bathroom (although a very nice size) did not have any hooks for clothing/bath robes and the shower did not have any shelf on which to place the toiletries. There is just something about placing the toiletries on the floor of the shower that was somewhat gross. Also, when we first arrived, the room was extremely fragrant with some type of air freshener. It was overwhelming at first. By the 2nd day, the air freshener smell had dissipated.

So the positive - location was great, room was clean and the flat screen was good. For the most part service was ok. The couple of issues that were disappointing were we checked in we were given a room with only a double bed. Now I am over 6' tall and would have had my legs hang over the end so we requested another room. Then once in the room we noticed bottle water was $6 each, while ok but I have stayed at 4 stars before that had free bottled water. 2nd, we had used valet parking at $60/day + tax and because of the Columbus day parade the street was closed in front of the hotel. Now we had asked will we be ok to get out? they said you will be fine if you leave by 9..we left at 8am and no we could not leave from the hotel but had to walk to get our car. What made it worse was 15 mins (while I was paying my bill I was told the concierge would help with bags (but instead) I was just shown where the garage was located from the hotel and we had to walk carrying everything (2 blocks).

It is about 5-7 minute walk to a subway station. For travellers, it is as good as it can be. There is a Starbucks not to far from it. In addition, there are many restaurants around as well as fast food places including McDonalds and Pret A Manger. A celebrity chef is about to open a restaurant by the hotel, which will give more dining options. Though I had a Metro card, I walked to most places during my entire 4/5 days in NYC. Common Area: There are a few chairs for you to sit on and not much else. The space is very compact. It has somewhat of a cramped feeling to it. Esthetically, it is pretty modern and sparse. There is a terrace (dining area) on the upper floor. I did not check that out so cannot say much. I don’t believe there are other amenities such as a gym etc.Room:I had the standard room. Understandably, it was very small, but functional and manageable. My friend and I are pretty compact and therefore we did fine. But for those who are six feet+ and well nourished, it could be very cramped. Closet is small and there is not a whole lot of space for storage. There is a desk, chair, reading chair, TV, and safe box. All works well, functional, and purposeful. The bathroom is really small, though functional. It takes an effort to be able to use the bathroom without bumping into things or knock things over. No complaint just wish there would be a little bit more of space. Service:Definitely a forte of this place. What lacks in space is made up for by the service I received. There is a doorman in front helping you with taxi and directions. Checking in was quick and pleasant. Local map was happily given when I requested one. Stephanie was particularly helpful with restaurant recommendations. She was my main source of restaurant info. I did not consult guidebooks or yelp. Her recommendations were spot on. Recommendation: This hotel is a good fit for those who want good service, comfort but willing to forgo certain amenities such as a gym or in-house bar. This place offers very good value. I definitely would recommend to friends or stay here in the future.","San Diego, California","SDWanderlust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",125,5.0

My wife and I had booked the tail-end of her work trip for a two-night stay in Manhattan, and were unsure of where to stay. We are pretty low-maintenance travelers, and value location above all else, followed by noise level, room size, bathroom amenities, and decor. We chose the Cassa based on the high reviews on Trip Advisor and looking back on our stay, the hotel delivered on all fronts.First off Troy, the General Mgr, was extremely helpful in answering my questions prior to my stay and treating my wife and I like valued guests. The staff too was impeccable with our check-in, answering questions, and any request that we had, in particular Tiffany, Eric, and Henry. The location of the Cassa is right in the heart of mid-town, close to Grand Central Station and just north of Times Square. Bryant Park is the closest subway stop, which is a 5-8min walk away, and Grand Central about 10min walk. Mid-town is pretty crowded, but the Cassa is tucked-away between 5th and 6th and is a nice escape from the craziness.We were in a Grand Deluxe size room and were pleased with the size (given NY standards). Nice little desk and lounge chair helped make it seem bigger than just a studio room with a king size bed. The bathroom is by far the highlight when it comes to the room, a modern, clean layout with the topper being the rainfall shower...the wife absolutely loved it. Also to be noted in the room was the flat screen TV with nice cable options, a bose-like sound system, and a mini-fridge where you could store a bottle water or two alongside the usual pay-to-eat items.Big plus about our room (on the 16th floor) and the Cassa in general, was how quiet it was. Very little street noise and never really heard from any of our neighbors above or adjacent to us. This is key, I'm a light sleeper and any type of noise in the night will wake and keep me up. I slept like a baby at the Cassa.Heard some negatives reviews about the elevators but they were prompt most every time we called them. Overall I would highly recommend the Cassa if you're looking for a classy, easy stay while you're in NYC. You'll be treated like an esteem guest and you'll feel rested (from a good night's sleep), clean (from the shower), and ready to take on city!",Chicago,"TheWindyCityTraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago</strong>",16,5.0

She mapped out directions to a bar in Brooklyn (complete with printing out the detailed google map of the neighbourhood and advice to avoid a train that is ""the worst""), recommended the yummiest affordable brunch one day and snagged us reservations at a restaurant with incredibly short notice the next day. She even emailed me afterwards to make sure we got there ok - who does that?!We briefly checked out the lounge on the 10th floor and used the free wifi there to check into our flights, and the front desk happily printed our boarding passes and called us a black car for the airport (we asked for a cab, but she advised the black cars were actually cheaper to Newark - great tip!). There was a cute little patio on the 10th floor and drinks for purchase. We went at happy hour and it was affordable for the area (though if you'd like to drink in your room, there is a Duane Reade right around the corner which sells beer which is half the price of TImes Square liquor stores.

The staff is incredibly nice and accommodating. The room is spacious especially by New York standards. The bathroom is large, bright and clean and the shower is wonderful. I was located on the inner block so the view was nothing to write home about, but it was quiet. My big issue was with the extremely soft bed; the softest I have ever slept on. The bed appeared to only have a mattress and a thick and soft upper pad and it made my back bend significantly. I ended up sleeping on the floor as it was more comfortable. As much as I like the rest of the hotel, I would never consider Cassa again because of the bed.","New York City, New York","joseph a</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",16,3.0

We were on level 27 and there was some good views from our room. Obviously being so high up meant noise from the street was not an issue. There is a very nice bar on the 10th floor with a terrace looking out on to the main street, was lovely to come back from a long days walking to relax here and have a drink. Location wise, this is ideal for Times Square, 5th avenue shopping, Theatre district, Diamond district, walkable distance to Port authority bus station for anyone looking to go to Jersey Gardens for shopping.This is pretty much all we were looking for from our hotel in New York. However, what we weren''t expecting was the absolute top class quality of the staff in this hotel. Any question we had was answered quickly with maps, directions, times of buses all printed out for us without having to ask. Taxi's were hailed for us at any time by the door staff. The Concierge's took the time out to go through different diners / restaurants to eat at close by, booked our tickets to go to Ground Zero, advised us on the best times to visit Empire State building to miss the queues etc. More importantly, they took the time out to get to know us, we never felt rushed at the desk and always felt like appreciated guests.

I honestly was just expecting them to fix it while we were gone exploring the city, but instead they upgraded our room. Granted please keep in mind this is New York ....... You are not getting a penthouse as your room. We were very pleased and shocked both Henry and Emilio went the extra mile. Thanks guys!!! As for location it was great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 minute walk to the following: subway, Top of the Rock, Central Park, Times Square, Grand Central Station.

Hooray. There are plenty of excellent hotels in locations just as good.I found the room minimal to the point of uncomfortable. It had the bed and a bathroom. Nice bed, nice bathroom but nothing special and nothing more than that. No extra space whatsoever in the room. We had to walk to the nearby starbucks to get hot water for tea (so, yes, we did just buy stuff at starbucks).The hotel did not seem to have any amenities. The front desk area was tiny and cold. Five steps to the elevator. That was it.The hallways were hideous. It felt like I was getting off the elevator in a 1970s apartment building.What about the service? No, really, that's my question - what service? There was an unfriendly robot to check us in and that was it. No problems with anyone but just absolutely nothing positive about it.Ultimately it was purely a place to stay. I jumped ship to the Sheraton on my last night in the cit. Finally - a hotel with a normal lobby, room amenities and overall comfort level.I do not recommend the Cassa and will never stay there again.","Los Angeles, California","theocanada</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",26,3.0

I travel to NY for business quite frequently and the Cassa Hotel caught my eye for the stylish rooms and the great rate for the mid-town location. I was pleasantly surprised by how much larger they were compared to some of the postings. If you travel to NY at all you know that real estate is at a premium, so having a room with more than 100 square feet is luxury. Even tho their rooms state that their smallest is 125 sq ft, i felt as tho the room was much larger. I stayed in a standard room with a full size bed. There was plenty of room to walk around and a great bathroom and shower. The furniture is modern and built for the space so it makes the room feel much larger. I've stayed in several hotels in the area and I've had a hard time walking around some of the beds and even getting in the door with my one suitcase let alone walk without bumping into something. This was a breath of fresh air. I also loved the fact that I had a bit of a view on the 25th floor. Usually any hotel in mid-town looks at another wall of a building or has no view at all.I was also surprised at how quiet the rooms were. I didn't hear any traffic noise or neighbor noise. I was not awaken in the middle of the night by the sound of the plumbing in the walls, and the cleaning staff were so quiet you didn't know they were working on the floors. They do have an onsite restaurant that will be functional in the near future called Butter.

My only reservation about booking a hotel online was, if my request for a ""low floor"" would be accepted. I cannot go in lifts, so the prospect of having been given a high floor, would have completely ruined my vacation. Thankfully, i had no problems at all...as soon as we arrived at the hotel, the reception staff greeted us warmly and explained everything to us. We checked in and i explained that i had requested a low floor, which turned out to be a 2nd floor with only one flight of stairs to go up! I also requested extra pillows which were delivered immediately. When we got to our room, we were pleasantly surprised as we had been warned, that New York hotel rooms were very small - ours was just right with a great bathroom and windows facing the street, a big tv and lovely air condition, which kept the room cool (as we got really warm weather whilst in NY) a very well stocked mini bar and even our own iron and hair dryer! Everything was great. The house keeping was excellent and was always done very early in the morning which was nice. The location of the hotel itself is fantastic! Everything to be seen in NY, is in walking distance literally. Your in the Theatre district and Times Square in less than 5 minutes! Surrounded by shops, bars and restaurants, there's nothing you can't find near the hotel. I can't stop recommending Cassa Hotel to my friends..the only negative i can say (which is not really the hotel's fault) is the pillows are too soft for me..i was using 4 at a time to sleep but that's just me coz i like been propped up!

We had to request for two bath robes, had to request for more shower gel (this wasnt automatically replemished), we were given four hangers for our clothes and had to request for more.

I had an important business meeting the morning after we checked into the hotel. That morning I ironed my shirt with the iron and ironing board provided by the hotel. To my horror, I realized the iron/board had rust, which transferred to my shirt. The concierge, Eric, did quickly step in to get the shirt cleaned (Eric was extremely helpful in booking restaurants and other entertainment during our stay- thank you Eric!). Unfortunately not all stains were removed and I did not realize this until the middle of my meeting, which was very embarrassing. When we discussed this with the manager he was extremely unsympathetic and even accused me of lying about the origin of the stain (even though I provided the hotel with the iron and ironing board which both showed rust). We requested replacement of the shirt or a credit to the room for the amount of the shirt but the manager refused to accept responsibility and assist us. In addition, the hotel experienced problems with their elevators during the first two days of our stay. Our room was on the 26th floor. With only one working elevator, we waited 5-10 minutes each time we needed to use the elevator, and each ride lasted another 5-10 minutes as we stopped on several floors to pick up other guests who had been waiting several minutes. This may not seem like much, but we each used the elevators about 10 times a day, which really adds up to a lot of time wasted. As small business owners ourselves, my fiancé and I understand the importance of quality customer service. It is disappointing to see this lacking, especially in the hospitality industry…an industry that is supposed to be “hospitable” by its very nature and name. We realize accidents happen and would have been happy to forgive the hotel had they admitted fault and accepted responsibility. Something as simple as an apology and $100 room credit would have gone a long way for Cassa Hotel. Instead, they lost two customers.","Frisco, Texas, USA","RLBFrisco_Texas_USA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Frisco, Texas, USA</strong>",4,1.0

The ""Deluxe"" should be renamed the ""Petite Deluxe,"" and Cassa should clearly indicate the square footage of their rooms, to avoid future customer surprises and disappointments.

I stayed here about 3 weeks after Superstorm Sandy and I'm not sure if that was the reason why the staff seemed less than friendly or if was just the way they were.Upon arrival, I didn't get a warm or friendly greeting and actually felt more like the guy behind the desk (Henry?) was an intern from school who couldn't be bothered to do more than take my credit card and give me a room key. He didn't tell me anything about the hotel and barely pointed out where the elevators were so I was left to figure things out myself (not difficult since the terrace wasn't open then and there were no restaurant or exercise facilities there to my knowledge). Still, given the positioning of this hotel as ""luxury boutique"", I did expect more for my initial interaction.I paid extra for a larger room and it was worth it as the room was still tight with the 1 bed. Not super small like you may find at other comparable hotels (like the W) but still not as ""large"" as expected. The room was quieter than most you'll find in Manhattan----given the new construction that's to be expected----but I could still hear some sounds from the street below despite being high up. The hotel is next to/near the Sofitel but lacks a lobby or other facilities (room service/dining etc) so if you want that go next door. The TV wasn't working correctly when I visited as some of the local channels were inaccessible --- again, not a huge problem since I didn't come there to watch tv but it would've been nice to watch the football games while relaxing or getting ready to go out. All in all, this hotel has a few kinks to work out in both its service and amenities before I would consider calling it a luxury hotel but given the low price I paid (under $150/night) it was a great deal----anything more than that and I would reconsider staying there as there are plenty of other places located in this area that are better or just as good for the price.",Los Angeles,"Manico</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles</strong>",77,3.0

The room had been booked as a double bed and we were hoping the hotel would accommodate at 1am give us a king size. The receptionist offered an upgrade rate for $85, then dropped it to $55, then to $45. While i understand a hotel needs to make money, the guy had so much attitude there was no way I wanted to pay extra. He also claimed that the hotel had numerous at 1am trying to book king rooms at the hotel (yeah sure). We went to the room and within an hour found a bed bug crawling on the soft located in the bathroom. It was disgusting.Since it was 1am we just asked the hotel to compensate us for the unlean nature of the room. Of course the receptionist would not do that, and instead moved us to a king.While we appreciate (finally) being moved into a king room, I will never stay at this hotel again for fear of bug issues and attitude of the receptionist. In all honesty, the hotel had a lot of potentialy - it was convenient and the rooms were quite decent.

We were on the 21st floor and it was pretty quiet at night. Our room had a huge flat screen TV on the wall and nice terry cloth robes for lounging. There is a great deli just up the street called Manhattan Cafe that has an amazing selection of fresh salads and hot foods. The Cassa is adding a restaurant that will open this summer called BLT that should be a nice addition--sometimes we were tired from a day of sightseeing and would have enjoyed just having dinner at the hotel. For now, breakfast and afternoon tapas and cocktails are offered on the 10th floor lounge that has indoor seating and an outdoor balcony. The breakfasts were very high quality and reasonable for NYC. There is a charge for Wi-Fi in the room ($15/day) but free Wi-Fi available 24 hours on the 10th floor lounge. The best thing about the Cassa is its smaller size and personalized service. When we went by the front desk, the staff greeted us. Even housekeepers in the hallway would say hello and have a nice day. All of the staff is super friendly and helpful. We really felt welcomed and appreciated. There was even a hand-written note from the manager in our room when we arrived to welcome us.

Their hotel staff is amazing!! This time I stayed in an executive room, and it was incredible! I have to say that I could not imagine staying anywhere else in the city. I am in NYC, so I do not need to stay at a hotel normally. When friends or family come into town, I most times make a point to stay over a couple nights, so I can show them around, and ultimately be closer to them.. The decor and style of the rooms is unmatched by any other hotel in NYC in my opinion. The rooms are not the size of a mini shoe closet. The 10th floor is phenomenal. A business center, lounging area-living room, and a bartender making cocktails! Who can beat this? The only thing that I didn't care for is the price of valet. $60 p/n is a little steep, especially when local car garages are $40 or $48 p/n. More courtesy pricing should be extended to your guests! Other than that..five out of five stars! Location is everything, and Cassa is near all restaurants, Broadway shows, Time Square and other major attractions!Cassa Hotel has a European feel about it.

I'm 49 years old and have grown tired of ""modern"" hotels that have a bed and just enough floor to walk around the bed. I'm also tired of hotels that are basically discos with rooms. For a while I've tried to say as far from Times Square as I could because of the throngs of people.I decided to stay at the Cassa as one of my friends just relocated from Los Angeles to work there. I feared it would be too close to Times Square and Broadway, but I went ahead and booked my stay for 10 days.All my concerns mysteriously disappeared the moment I walked in. I was greeted by an extremely courteous and knowledgeable staff. I was shown to a proper room, that actually had room to walk around in and a very nice bathroom (I'm still missing that shower).The location of the hotel was perfect. 46th Street heats up west of Broadway, but between 5th and 6th was a little bit of heaven. Not as busy as some other streets and I had no trouble getting cabs right outside of the hotel.A lot of my meetings were near the hotel, and of course, all the plays I saw, with the exception of one that was playing at Lincoln Center were in walking distance as were some of my favorite pre and post theater restaurants and bars. The location couldn't be more perfect.My room, beyond it's spaciousness was delightfully quiet. After a day of hustle and bustle, it was wonderfully relaxing to return to my quiet room and really relax.As my stay was a long one, I became friendly with the staff, and found that I had made some friends by the end of my stay. It's very nice to be greeted by name when you walk in. The Cassa NY is my new home away from home in NYC. I have no qualms about returning as my stay was as close to perfect as possible. My only problem was getting out of the confort of my bed on time to make my meetings.

There was also a hairdryer in the room. The TV had plenty of channels and was. Good size. We had nice views from our room. We didnt use the bar other than for an hour or so on our last day when we were waiting for the taxi. It was really chilled out and calming, although i did almost have a heart attack when i paid $5 for a can of lemonade! It did have free wifi though.The location was great. Literally 5 minute walk from times square, 15minute walk to central park. There is a pret a manger next door and a starbucks down the road. Check out was at 12 and they kept our luggage for us in a secure place. As we would be traveling to the airport during rush hour, the hotel suggested we booked a taxi for $69, so we did. The taxi was waiting 15 minutes early for us and the hotel took our suitcases to the car for us. We were so glad we booked our taxi as traffic was busy and all other taxis were occupied! There are 2 things that could have made this hotel reach the 5/5 for us. The first being having a kettle and tea/coffee facilities in the room. The second thing is breakfast. I know they do offer breakfast in the hotel, but the choice was very limited - basically, it was posh breakfast when i wanted american pancakes!I would highly recommend this hotel and would definately return. You wont be disappointed! Thank you Cassa!",,Laupea,1,4.0

The location at W45th and Avenue of the Americas (6th Avenue) is a perfect location a block from Times Square. Maybe three blocks from Grand Central Station and two blocks from two subway stations. It is easy access to all of the broadway theaters. Though the apartment wasn't managed by the hotel, the hotel staff could not have been more professional, helpful and friendly. Not only the front desk personnel but also the cleaning and maintenance staff always had a ""good morning"" or ""good evening."" There was a genuineness in their actions that made us feel good. They were ready to answer any question and provide informative advice. The clientele is very international, I'm sure it is attributable to the location. Restaurants are close in every direction, and shopping opportunities are unlimited as 5th Avenue is only a block away.I cannot speak to the hotel accommodations but the location provides easy access to the theater district without the chaos of Times Square.

The rooms are dark and poorly lit. Internet access is a $15/day surcharge as well.The restaurant is more of a lounge with a couple of overpriced but well presented options - an understandable choice given the tiny size of the kitchen and the proximity to real food nearby.

I love the music it played!The hotel smelled very nice as well. When we first walked in the hotel staff greet us and were all very helpful. Our flight had arrived earlier than expected and were hoping to do an early check in and without hesitation, ""Tiffany,"" the receptionist at the desk advised us that she was able to check us in prior to the original 3:00pm check in time. It was great!Room:Once we got into our room, we noticed that the room was a little small but we were still very happy with it. It was clean and there seemed to be a very light fragrance in the room but it smelled nice. In the bathroom, it was very clean as well. Everything was fully stocked and neatly organized. Inside the shower, there was two shower heads. As for the bed, it was very comfortable and the linens were clean. There is also a small closest and a safe as well. Located on the wall in front of the bed, there is large flat screen TV. The lighting in the room was rather dim but it didn't brother us too much. Location: The location was great! Located in Midtown NYC and was only a few minute walk out to Times Square and Theater District. Amenities: There is a gym but we did not get to use it because we were constantly on the go. On the 10th floor, it is where you can get some breakfast however, it is not complimentary. The terrace is also on the 10th floor and it wasn't quite open as it is still very cold out. As well, free Wifi ""Cassa lounge"" is also located on the 10th floor. There is a password required for it but all we did was just ask the reception for it. If you were located close to the 10th floor, you could be able to pick up the signal but as we were on the 23rd, we were unable.Overall, we both liked this hotel and I do recommend this hotel as this hotel has superb service and has a great location.","Ottawa, Canada","520tiramisu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",6,4.0

As we get there we got a room that was so small, so small that we couldn't even open our luggage. We kindly asked the reception to switch to a new, bigger room. The receptionist showed us a bigger room and told us that we had to wait for a day so we could change it. Next day, they moved our luggages during the afternoon and as we got back at night, we figured out that they moved us to a diferent room than the one they had shown us and the room was a little bit larger, but still tiny. We complained at the front desk again and they initially tried to make us accept that room, but we didn't. They told us that the hotel was full and that we had to wait another night to change. We accepted, against our will. The second room had the sheet and blanket full of stains of I don't know what. Next day, they moved us to a nice bigger and descent room. The front desk manager told us that the boutique hotels are like that: one room is different from another. I, as an architect and interior designer, told the manager that I had designed a boutique hotel in Brasil and I never had such a small room in my life. My advice to everyone that pretends to go to NY is to check room sizes before, cause normally people spend much time shopping in this city and those smaller rooms are awful for more then one luggage. We had four luggages. One of then we had to be open in the bathroom. Bathroom design were great, but the shower area didn't have a place to put shampoos and soaps. We had to put it on the floor. The shower makes big noises when you switch to a smaller shower. The second room stayed a while with no water as we switched from the main shower to the small one. Overall, as we changed our room, we loved the hotel.

It truly is like having a home in the City. I stayed for three nights in mid February. And I have to say - I absolutely loved it. Mostly bc I had the best nights of sleep I've ever had in the City. The reason is - the rooms are cozy and quiet. From the minute the bellman opened the door to my room I knew, this was it. The rooms are beautifully outfitted. Perfect size for NYC. My room was on the interior, not the street side. This enabled me to open the window at night to get a bit of fresh air without the noise of traffic. I woke up in the morning completely refreshed. Room service was attentive, timely and delicious. And when I called to get my car from the valet, it was brought up promptly. The location is great too.

We booked to stay in an Executive King Room and requested a high floor after reading Room Tips on here. Our Executive King Room was spacious, but any smaller I think would have been a bit too small. Even though we were on the 27th floor, we could still hear noise from the street below, this didn't cause us a problem as neither of us are light sleepers, if you are you might want to request higher than floor 27. The bathroom was clean and modern with toiletries provided. I wouldn't reccomend this hotel for a business trip as the desk is very small and you have to pay $10 a day for wifi.

I think the things that would move it from being average to above average are in process - namely, they need a better waiting area and a restaurant (being built).Our flight arrived early in the morning and we got to the hotel about 10:30. We are perfectly prepared to stow our bags and occupy ourselves until check in, if necessary, but I always check to see if per chance we can get in early. It's much appreciated if they can do it, but not expected. After the initial pre-check in, we occupied ourselves til about 1:30. Thought we'd check again to see if anything came open. No. OK, occupied ourselves some more, checked back about 2:30 (check in is at 3). Still nothing. OK. Asked if something would be ready by 3 (check in time) and was informed she wasn't sure as they had given some guests late checkout. I was getting crabby as I'd been up since 4 a.m. and walking around the city since 10:30, so I was prepared for a fight if our room wasn't ready at 3 as that's cutting into time I am paying for. Giving late checkouts is nice, but not at other guests' expense. We went next door to the Pret to wait the next half hour as the hotel has no comfortable lounge at the moment. They have a temporary lounge set up on the 10th floor (looks like an employee break room in reality) with no water on offer (they don't open til 4). In fact, there is nowhere on site to acquire a bottle of water at all except for the mini bar in the room. Checked back shortly after 3 and was informed by Arta that they had upgrated us from the Executive room to Grand Executive in order to get us in on time. Phew. That was very nice.As to the room, there wasn't really anything grand about it - I can't imagine the Executive being any smaller. The bathroom was of a decent size and had a nice shower with rain showerhead. Good quality shampoos and soaps, though I found the smell sickening (I think it was chocolate-scented? Just a personal dislike I have with that fragrance in bath products). otherwise, the room had all the basics - hair dryer, safe, closet with plenty of hangars, bath robes and mini bar if you care about it. The bed was very comfortable! Other than that, there was a small desk and chair and another small chair and footstool. Electrical outlets by the bed were non-existent, though there was one iPod docking station. Some people don't have iPhones and others have two - many of us use our clocks as alarm clocks or just want their phones charging on the nightstand, so having outlets accessible to guests is really a must-have in this day and age.As to the aesthetics of the hotel decor, I can see where some of the negative comments come in. While the primary color theme is white, it is often set against dark brown (at times worn). The effect ends up stark, yet dark and drepressing. The lobby furnishings are white, but the floor is dark-finished concrete and the halogen lights don't flood the area well. The hallways are dark brown carpeting, dark brown walls and dark brown doors - our floor at least looked a little worse for wear - the effect of all the dark brown was reminiscent of 70s wood paneling vs the rich look I think they were going for.Anyway, all the staff was friendly and our stay was fine. They just need to step up the amenities a bit.","Winter Springs, Florida","ellsbird</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winter Springs, Florida</strong>",12,3.0

OK, I should have mentioned this to the management before check-out, but the thought of plumbers probing pipes during Thanksgiving weekend was worse than the occasional noise.

I recently stayed here with a friend. I was actually using this experience to scope out a possible stay for one night with my girlfriend in mid-December. The location was great but was very disappointed with our stay. We arrived at our designated check-in time to find out that our room was not yet available. We just traveled for so long in a cramped bus and all we wanted to do was relax in our room for a bit. The front desk said we could leave our bags with them and come back in a bit.We went to a bar for about an hour before returning. Upon coming back we see that our bags were kind of still just loosely near the front desk; not rally being attended for. Anyone could have taken our bags! So after waiting an hour we were told our room was STILL not ready. How do they not prepare a room within an hour when someone is waiting?!We finally get to our room, to find out how SMALL it is. When we booked online, we did so based on the picture accompanying the reservation. We simply felt cheated and dooped. At night, when we were trying to sleep, there was this loud generator right on the other side of the wall where the bed was that just shook the bed all night long; the constant buzzing made it really hard to sleep.We asked about the noise and was simply told ""We are not sure"" - and that was that. We asked if we could possibly move to another room, was told they would look into it, and we never heard back!Luckily, we were only staying one night, so we just cut everything up as a loss. And just said - screw it - its not worth following up with. I was really hoping our stay was better. I am looking to stay in NYC for a night during the holiday season, and was hoping I could take the little lady somewhere I knew and stayed before, so that way there would be no surprised.

All in all, it was a very nice hotel. Very clean and modern, just how we like it. We were placed in the 4th floor the first 2 days. I'm very sensitive to noise when sleeping. The first night, I was so tired I fell asleep even though I could hear music playing. The second night was a different case. I was hearing all sorts of music. I though since our room was adjacent to the building next door and not another room, we couldn't really ask them to turn down their music. It's fine if it's white noisy...but I could differentiate every song I heard. And to be honest, I did not recall any noisy building when walking back to the hotel after dinner. So, it was very strange....So, we called the front desk to request a change of room. The front desk asked if I would like to move one floor up. Since there's a limited number of the suite we booked. Here's where the conversation gets interesting...Front desk: ""Would you like to move one floor up?""Me: ""Well it seems like the noise is coming from the next building, so the issue would still be there... BTW, is there a club or bar next door, the music is so loud?""Front desk: ""I'm sorry, what did you mean by a club...we are in a hotel building...""Me: ""Well the music.... (I was so tired at the time I didn't want to dwell on the subject), anyway, I would like to move as far away from this room as possible.""Front desk: ""That's fine, but we do not have another suite. So that would mean downgrading to another room."" ...And so we did (while paying for the same cost). After we packed, we went back downstairs to change keys and rooms. That's when I noticed the music was playing in the LOBBY. That's when I figured, the music that was keeping me up at night was not some invisible club or bar next door, but it was from the lobby! I would highly recommend the hotel to either turn down the music after hours, move the speakers away from the ceiling, or just get better sound proofing floor for those guests who are staying on the lower floors. At the end, we moved to a downgraded room on the other side of the building. And I was able to sleep peacefully for the next few remaining days. The hotel would definitely get one more star if it was not for what happened. But overall, everything else was nice. I would stay here again, book another room, and specifically ask for a hotel on the upper floor.","Castro Valley, California","mka_sf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Castro Valley, California</strong>",2,3.0

My room was very quiet, looking out on the back side of the hotel (no view to speak of, but hey, it's NYC). Location wasn't near anything major I was going to (except Little Brazil), so others' reviews can probably speak to this better. The breakfast room was empty when I showed up, but it overlooked the street, for a nicely lit ""view.""The not-as-good: Room was really tiny, as in the large bathroom was almost half its size. Mine was so small I had to turn sideways to slip into the bed. There was not a functional closet to speak of, so I had to hang my clothes on the back of the door. The desk was also half depth, which made for a less than comfortable work session with my laptop. It also was not well lit at all. Given that the furnishings were black, and the walls darker in color (which was nice, I'm not complaining), the room really could have used more lighting if you like things bright when you work.

After the long wait, I was told that my reservation was cancelled and that the best solution is for me to contact hotwire.

Sound proofing was also of a good standard (very important in NY). Hotel is well situated in 44th and close to everything - shops, 5th ave, Broadway, Rock, Times Square.

Hopefully the advertised soon to open on site BLT Restaurant will deal with this shortcoming and give one a place where one can go to unwind or entertain a visitor at the end of the day. Service at the Tapas cafe was also not great and it appears that the hotel wants to stay away from providing these extras and drive guests to use the establishments on the streets of NY.

The shower pressure was fantastic as well comparing to other boutique hotels in NYC. Everyone at the front desk was professional, friendly and helpful.I was slightly disappointed with their rooftop bar/lounge. It was like a cafeteria more than a real bar/lounge/restaurant. Their staff was very friendly and helpful answering my questions. I was informed that they are in the process of building a real bar/lounge/restaurant downstairs next to the lobby. I was also slightly disappointed with the severe corner wall and desk damage which is not pleasant to look at, but they covered it with the desk chair which made it a lot more pleasant for the eyes, but I can still see them when I sat at the desk. It would be nice if Cassa can place a work order to have that patched/fixed. It doesn't seem like a big nor a pricy job, but it would match the quality of everything else this hotel offers. Overall, my stay at Cassa was fabulous and would definitely stay here again next time I visit NYC.

Two blocks from grand central, times square, Bryant park and 5min from the Rockefeller complex.The negatives are only a couple. The hotel wireless service is extremely expensive at $10 a day.

I complained at the check-in but was told by a fairly rude receptionist, that either I like it or I leave it. In any case I have to pay for it. Although I asked for a king size or double bed with my reservation, I was told, that they were out of kingsize, since there were only a few available anyway. Considering the price of the hotel - $ 381.00 plus ~ $ 60.00 tax, in total 440.00 per night - it was a very unpleasant and sleepless stay. Not to mention the ugly view on a very dirty courtyard, and the smalles wardrobe I have ever seen. The aircondition was fairyl week, but noisy. To open in window into the courtyard was even noisier.

Yes, it's New York City, etc. etc., but I have stayed in bigger rooms in nyc. Perhaps I was also influenced by the not so lovely view from my window, which included looking over a roof with building materials (that said, the hotel can't do anything about what transpires around it). I also found the room lacking in some basic things: a way to make coffee or tea, some basic information about the hotel services, or even a 'do not disturb' sign I could hang on my door would've been nice (and would have prevented numerous knocks on the door from the housekeeping services).","Tel Aviv, Israel","drz30</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tel Aviv, Israel</strong>",5,4.0

During my conversation I mentioned my daughters 16th bday. I had called to request a room with two doubles,I was unaware that Hotwire books the cheapest room and that two doubles would be much more costly. On the phone they understood my situation and saud they would upgrade for free to a King room. Both of us would be sleeping in the same bed but its a King, not as bad right? I also requested an early check in, around noon. On our arrival, Sept 28th 2012, around noon, I was greeted and recognized by the same young lady I had spoken to, she promptly wished my daughter a happy birthday, I was quite surprised and pleased, she then informed me that she had me upgraded to a double twin, wow, thats def something Hotwire wouldnt have done even though they said on the phone they would. We went up to our room, 1608 and it was simply beautiful, clean and large for a NYC room, after a few minutes I noticed a hand written bday card to my daughter and a platter of assorted nuts and treats also two bottles of water. The card had a personal hand written message to her wishing her a happy 16th amoung other things. During our three night stay the staff was above exceptional. I felt at home and they were more than willing to answer and help in any way possible. The room was cleaned spotless everyday.

Hubby and I were here from september 1 to the 8th, we took a red-eye from phx so we were in NY by 6am got to the hotel expecting to leave our luggage only cause we knew our check-in was at 3 pm not a problem but we were greeted with not only a room ready for us but a little bit of an upgrade to a queen-sized bed (again not expecting that cause we know what we paid for on priceline and we're not that kind of entitled people wanting to get everything for a buck). I cannot stress enough the quality of staff they have, everybody I wish I remembered their names ( I just remember the two Erics) they were phenomenal from helping with where to go eat, where to go etc. We just mentioned we where there for my birthday and there it was a bottle of wine waiting for me on my birthday after a loong day it really was appreciated.The room overall is beautiful, great bed, great bathroom, great tv.. If there is a rainy day there will be umbrellas waiting for you at the entrance of the hotel.If I say the location is beyond belief awesome that's an understatement, walk 1 block to the left... TIMES SQUARE, and near-by subway station gets you everywhere or doormen in the hotel wont hesitate in getting you a cab. When I come back to New York (and I will, cause one week is not even enough to see everything there is to see in this amazing city) I will surely stay here again, sometimes is best to pay a little bit more to get the entire experience.Keep up the good work!","Phoenix, Arizona","Nana C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",0,5.0

The check in process became quite problematic because only the names of the men were on the reservation and the women arrived first while the men were at the tennis tournament. Because of the hotel's security policy, they could not check in until we were called by our wives and then had to separately call the hotel to vouch for our wives. This was extremely inconvenient and could be avoided if the hotel instituted a policy that asked for this kind of information at the time a reservation is made.The hotel itself is very conveniently located and a beautiful property, though a bit stark in decor. Much construction is underway, leading to a rough impression for guests. The rooms are beautifully decorated and very serviceable, though the Internet service is not advertised as free but can be obtained without charge; quite confusing.Staff could not be more friendly and helpful, including the always present doormen and other personnel.

So far staff have been courteous and polite, Roger was very helpful when he checked me in, and the room is very comfortable, great bed, plenty of space for me and wouldn't be a problem if I was travelling with a partner. NYC hotel rooms are generally small but I was pleasantly surprised by the room size here. The bathroom is great - love the shower! Plenty of closet space - I managed to unpack my entire suitcase without a problem. I chose the location for convenience for work rather than anything else but it's very central in general, subway close by, Starbucks, restaurants etc. And yet despite the centrality the room itself is very quiet (a few times I wondered if I'm alone on this floor?!) and no traffic noise from the street. Not a great view but I'm not here for the view so that doesn't bother me.My only comment would be that for an Executive traveller (I didn't make my booking but think I'm in an executive room - 2204) although the docking stations and outlets are very convenient, the desk size could be larger. I'm working with a laptop and iPad plus business documents, and the desk is very small and along with an armchair doesn't allow for the most comfortable working situation. I worked on the 10th floor a few times as the chair height was more comfortable and I could spread myself around a little. Perhaps if the desk area could be extended below the television set it would help. Also a small drawer with stationery accessories would be helpful (stapler, paper clips etc).Also a little disappointed the fitness centre not open.

Though I hate the neighborhood for its noise, crowding, and dirtiness, it's really the most convenient place to be if you have business on the West Side. I was upgraded from a queen room (for which I paid $279+tax on Expedia) to a king room. Even the king room was quite small, with a half closet and a tiny work desk, so it's hard to imagine how tiny the queen room would be. My room would not have been comfortable for two people but it was perfectly fine for one. And the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and nice.There does not seem to be free wireless in the guest rooms, though there is in the common rooms of the hotel. As I started to call the desk to ask about wireless I realized that I could use the free wireless of the Algonquin hotel, which is directly behind the Cassa, since my room was on the back of the hotel. And speaking of the room location, being on the back meant it was very quiet, and the height of the hotel compared to the buildings around it meant that it also had good natural light.I realize as I write this that I don't have anything terribly positive or negative to say about this hotel. It's hard to imagine raving about it, but it was quite comfortable, the staff was friendly, and sine I got a good rate, it was certainly worth it. In a neighborhood where you are paying for the location more than the room, I think this hotel is a good value.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","TripsPlease</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",60,4.0

Location couldn't have been better.Rooms - Small! We had 2 different rooms. The first room we had was super tiny. Just enough room to walk around the bed and so little room for storage, we had settled into putting our clothes on the bottom shelf in the bathroom vanity. (there was no room anywhere else, they should figure out some storage for guests who are there more than 1 night). We moved into a 2-double beds room (hubby and I) and ended up with a room about twice in size, #1708.Beds - very comfy. Major problem though. We booked a king bed and when we settled down to lay in bed in our first room, we realized the king was actually a queen. We had paid substantially more to specifically get a room with a king and not a queen, and when we called down to let them know the error, we ended up getting back-talk, and a very rude ""manager"" on the phone to us, telling us that we were wrong and that he wouldn't help us. After an hour's worth of having people in our room, and arguing, (tired from our long day this is the last thing you want to be doing), we told them we will be leaving tomorrow and staying somewhere else for our next 5 days of NYC. The Manager again with a rude tone told us ""good luck finding somewhere else to stay!"" My husband hung up on him. All we wanted was what we paid for, a king bed so that we would get a good night's sleep. We kept telling him this but no co-operation from him.I started to call (on cell phone) around for a room somewhere else, when the manager called our room and apologized and said he would give us one of the rooms that had 2 double beds. We were so relieved to know that at least if we can't get a king, we can get some sleep in 2 doubles.I was really expecting to have such a great stay here. I am so disappointed with how the staff handled this. All we wanted was our king bed like we had paid for.Minibar - they have a minibar and I asked if I could put milk in the minibar as I need my fibre in the mornings (cereal) and they even gave me a hard time about that saying it will cost me $30 just to take some things out of the fridge.. After some arguing they allowed me to do so without charging me.Amenities - a few doors down there is a pharmacy / convenience store, so super convenient.Other staff - wonderful, opening the doors for you, and setting up limo times etc. The fellow who moved us from room to room to room was super.Smoke - very strange, the hotel rooms almost always smelled of smoke. Every time we came back to our room, I could smell smoke but also something of an air freshener trying to cover it up.. We found it bizarre.. but didn't complain as we felt we could handle the smell and our priority was getting some sleep.On an aside, sites we would suggest seeing:9/11 memorial was our favourite stop, statue of liberty, (we saw both of these from the water taxi which was a great deal and we would do the water taxi again), a broadway show (go to TKTS which is in the middle of times square) and get your tickets the same day of the show for 40-50% off. Awesome! We saw The Best Man and it was great. Also you need to try dinner at Ruth's Chris, which was amazing. ""The view"" restaurant (with revolving floor) was overrated. The Empire State Building was great, going to the top. Soho was nice. Shopping on 5th Ave., a must. Central park is huge and a must see. The cabs sit in traffic a lot so you're better walking if you can handle it. We took the subway a couple of times, and they are very efficient but quite dirty. NYC is super fast paced, you need good walking shoes, there is a tonne to see and do.","Burlington, On, Canada","Miss_Tracy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Burlington, On, Canada</strong>",82,2.0

I only stayed one night at the beginning and end of my trip so I didn't have to unpack. Storage was a little lacking but it wasn't an issue for me. I thought the room by New York standards was perfect. I've stayed in smaller spaces. The upgrade to a queen room was a unexpected perk.

It's a short walk away from Times Square but you are not distracted by the noise, hustle & bustle associated with Times Square. It's also very centrally located close to all the major retail and boutique shops and after having visited the other neighbourhoods of Manhattan, I'm still glad we chose Cassa.We had a basic King bedroom which was more than sufficient.

We were told it would be about an hour. No problem at all, they took our bags and we did a bit of shopping at Times Square which is just 2 blocks away.

The beds are so comfortable too, which is always a potential issue, but not a problem in this case.The room (2505) was very tastefully decorated and was just perfect for us.

There is also a Starbucks across the road which is very handy too when you need a caffeine fix!!We had a couple of days of rain during our visit and made use of the complimentary umbrellas made available to guests ( great touch!).On our last day, I really didn't want to leave.. There will be NO searching the next time we visit New York, as we've found all we need in Cassa!!We came back early from shopping/sightseeing one afternoon to have a drink in the bar, and that was the ONLY negative really.. There wasn't a lot of choice to drink (just consisted of a small table with a few bottles on), no crisps/nuts available (to buy or complimentary) and the tapas available was actually only a choice of two!

Coupled with the fact that all major subway routes run through Time Square means that you are situated in the ideal location to get anywhere in Manhattan within 30 minutes or so.Secondly the room. Spotless, spacious, with a shower big enough to hold a party in, and a TV large enough to put a cinema out of business, you simply couldn't ask for more. Room service looked after the room at least once a day, and the housekeepers did a fantastic job. After they had been the room looked just as clean and tidy as the day we checked in! Inside the room was of course the obligatory minibar, however included were use of a complementary travel adaptor and umbrella, a very nice touch.Thirdly and finally the staff, there are no words to put on paper how helpful and professional they were.

It was a great choice overall. The location can't be beat: 2 blocks from Times Square where all the action is without the noise of the area, and just a minute walk from 5th Avenue. The staff are very friendly (took time to guide us through maps and spots to eat) and helpful. I initially booked a Deluxe Queen Room but even though it was about 30 square meters the layout was not great and felt small. Plus it was at the back of the hotel which offered no view at all except some old buildings. I upgraded immediately to an Executive King Room, where the layout was much better, almost 40 square meters in area and positioned at the front of the hotel with great views for only 35 Dollars a day more. Well worth it. The hotel is newly renovated, bathrooms are very clean, bed was a very comfortable queen size.Although I am very happy with the hotel and I recommend it anyone, there were some issues with it:- There is negligible closet space with just a couple of hangers. They were quick to bring us more hangers but with two people in the room it gets tricky trying to fit your clothes in that small space.- They left only one small bottle of shampoo/body wash every day. For people like myself and my wife who like to take at least 2 showers each day, you quickly run out of the stuff.- There is wi-fi offered in the room for a fee and works great. However, it's better to sign up with the front desk for it and get an access code instead of trying to do yourself over their web interface. Insist on getting your access code, so that you can hook up all your devices with a single daily subscription. Some of the staff seemed unaware of this, and informed me that I needed a separate daily subscription for each of my devices. This is not true, and to their credit you can connect more than one device per subscription. Just ask for your access code.- The air-conditioning unit behind a panel on the wall was very noisy and we had to turn it off to be able to sleep.","Nicosia, Cyprus","Evagoras C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nicosia, Cyprus</strong>",0,5.0

Great soundproofing from the street, no noise.We had breakfast in the terrace which was actually very good considering the cramped kitchen area. Service was ok as the waiter was pleasent but dry, While I was there I saw that they were working on restaurant being built on the ground level of the street, shoyuld be very nice once it opened.

The room located on the 21st floor turned out to be pretty small: the queen bed was actually a mini-queen and the closet was really tiny, difficult to manage two medium size suitcases around. The bathroom was nice and clean (great shower) and surprisingly large considering the room.I was offered an upgrade to the deluxe queen room, king bed (located on the same floor) for a daily $105 (+taxes) rate and decided to accept as my wife and I were to stay for a full week. The new room was definitely more ample although the king bed was actually more like a (real) standard queen. The bathroom was exactly the same size as in the standard room and the closet was (again) super-tiny size, definitely not indicated for stays longer than 1 or 2 nights. Each and every room sports the same closets (super-tiny) size, they told me.

They accommodated our stay from start to finish- providing us with their advice on ""must-see"" places around the city as well as restaurants that New Yorkers enjoy.After doing plenty of research about New York and it's popular hotels, we realized that all hotels have small rooms. The rooms at Cassa are actually not THAT small, they are spacious and comfortable enough for two people, are modern and VERY clean. The rooms feature a nice sized TV, a cozy bed big enough for two, a decent sized washroom, a desk (which was helpful for charging laptops/cell phones) as well as an organized closet with a safe and mini fridge. The location of this hotel is perfect. Its about a 10 minute walk from Time Square, surrounded by stores and places to eat and there is a drug store right beside it. We were fortunate enough to visit during a weekend where they blocked off the street beside the hotel and food/gift vendors set up a marketplace- a really nice way to spend a morning.My experience with New York city was a great one and the accommodations at Cassa made it even better - hope to return very soon!","Toronto, Canada","re3291</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",5,5.0

Spent days to find the best hotel at the best fair, many was already full and I finally picked the Cassa that I had already preselected.The hotel looks incredibly sexy with great design and furnitures. The room was reeeaaaally small, a bit too small for more than 2 nights. The bed was great, firm enough with comfy pillows. The views was nice too over the roofs of New York. The bathroom was excellent with nice toileteries, taking a shower with great view on buildings and streets, with Time Square lights, great !The location is just perfect if you choose Midtown. On 42th street, you are just a few steps from Time Square, 6th Avenue, the Park. We did walk down to the river the first day but we finally found the neighbourhood not so cool to find some great new-yorkers restaurant. So it was basically a cab ride every night to find more interesting spots down in the South.The food at the breakfast was really tasty and appealing but it was clearly not enough : 1 drink, 1 dish, no extra breads or opened choices.. After 1 try, we opted for some bakeries such as ""au bon pain"" where you can order some bagels, muffins, donuts, large variety of coffees or teas, and with the whole nyc atmosphere in the early mornings.On the other downside, we had to wait hours for the check-in after an 8h-flight, no special treatment nor upgrades, too bad!

The building is new and modern in style and as its name suggests, contains both a hotel and condominium.The small, modern lobby sets the tone for the hotel in style and setup. The fixtures are modern, but things are snug. With luggage trolleys and a few guests, it could get crowded quickly. The staff I dealt with all seemed friendly, but the fact they are doing double-duty for the building residents means they have a slightly different vibe than a traditional, dedicated hotel staff. I didn't need much assistance, and my interactions were all good.Up in the rooms, in my case 1403, it was the same situation: modern, snug and just missing a little something I can't put my finger on. The rooms are small. Pretty well-designed in the sleeping area, but the lack of storage is glaring. I had one small overnight bag and I still had some difficulties. I can't imagine what the guests I saw with gigantic rolling suitcases did with them and their contents. The bed was a full-size bed, which was ok for me, but a couple might feel cramped. Bedding was good. The maid does like to come early, so put out the Do Not Disturb sign if you are not an early bird!The bathroom was sleek and clean. It too did not have much in the way of storage. Solo travelers would be fine (unless you were a woman with a lot of makeup you wanted to set out), but again, couples would find it challenging. I liked the spacious glass rainforest shower and modern sink. It was kept immaculately.So, all in all, everything here was good, clean and completely adequate. As long as you are comfortable with the scaled-down design, you will like the room. Staff were also pleasant. But for me, there was something slightly off about the property. I would certainly stay there again, but otherwise didn't have any particularly warm final impressions of the property.","Rhinebeck, New York","DeanPok</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rhinebeck, New York</strong>",48,3.0

We were told twice that the problem was fixed and twice that we would be moved to another room. Unfortunately, neither one happened.The staff was very friendly, but they don't provide good customer service. If there are no problems, it's a nice place to stay.

I noted on our helicopter trip that we had actually got a better deal for 5 of us by booking via Cassa Hotel than the couple in the queue ahead of us who were using a Groupon voucher. Ditto with the theatre tickets. We were recommended the best show for kids and told when the optimal time to go would be. Looking for the best hot-dogs in town, we were recommended the Shake Shack, which richly deserves its reputation and long queues - everyone loved it.The staff at the front desk couldn't do more for us, especially on the day we left, which was New Year's eve. It was obvious that people were pouring into town and the hotel were checking in lots of new guests yet they still gave us two hours extra time to pack after we should have checked out and the icing on the cake was the limousine booked to take us to the airport at a fixed price of 69 USD.

The room was just big enough for my girlfriend and myself (I would probably have felt a bit crowded in the standard queen room I'm guessing) however it was well done with a clean layout and a very nice bathroom (big shower - big enough to make me wonder why they didn't put in bathtubs). The closet in the room is micro sized - so if you have any real plans to use a closet - you better rethink them.The main highlight of the trip was the OUTSTANDING service from the front desk staff. They really have the right attitude about customer service - no doesn't appear to be a word they've heard before. Always willing to try and figure something out for you and do it with a smile. Really impressive. This was certainly the best front desk staff I've seen in years of stays in NYC (and I would rank them right up there with staff at the Mandarin). If you want to be treated with top notch service in a clean setting (but don't mind a potentially smallish queen room if there are 2 of you) - this is the place to go. I booked via Hotwire, so great value for me - although the rates on their website seemed a bit expensive for the dates I was traveling (I could have booked virtually any hotel in the city for their website prices). Oh yea... location was great if you want to be in mid-town.

It is very convenient to get anywhere in the city and it is CLEAN. My husband and I stayed here for a weekend in December. We had originally booked only one night, but that's never enough in NYC - so we extended our stay for another night. We were on the 6th floor, the hotel is very clean, the location is just perfect.

The bed was more than comfortable, there's an iHome, TV and the standard mini-bar. The bathroom is just a bathroom and shower, but the shower is updated and is just an experience. The only ""lacking"" piece of the room is that there is practically no closet space. But it is New York and most hotels are that way - unless if you're paying more obviously. The only reason I cant give it a 5 star review is due to the lack of wi-fi (you have to pay a daily fee to get access to their wi-fi) and the customer service. In this day and age wi-fi is just a standard. It's even free at most fast food locations! Customer service, was slow. Everybody at the front desk is friendly and helpful for the most part, but there were just long wait times.

After hours there were plenty of restuarants and bars nearby and, of course, just a short walk to Times Square. Also, the front desk personnel were without exception friendly and helpful.Now the bad news: I had a room on the 26th floor which I believe is the highest floor of the hotel (the residences start on 27). Each morning I was awakened around 7:00 by a very loud, obnoxious noise that sounded like the howl of a prehistoric monster or a creature from the TV show Lost. I believe the noise came from the elevator shaft but have no idea how it was generated. Perhaps some air compression from the operation of the elevator? For that reason alone, I would not chose this hotel again. I will also say that although my bed was perfectly big and comfortable, the room itself was quite small. And by the way, there is no lobby.Lastly, for some reason my room was not properly outfitted. There was no TV channel guide, no umbrella in the armoire, and no mini-bar refrigerator (which my colleagues had in their rooms).I was booked into this room by my travel agent who said it was a much better deal than the higher end hotels I usually use. Perhaps I am out of touch with NYC hotel rates but at $350 for night one, and $450 for nights 2-3, it didn't seem like much of a bargain.","Menlo Park, California","Charles R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Menlo Park, California</strong>",2,2.0

If you're a couple then you must aim for a King sized bed as otherwise you'll end up hugging each other in their so called Queen size... which is more like a large single. After some discussions we managed to obtain a room with a King size bed in a delux room free of charge which made a huge difference to us given we stayed for five nights. The room decor is very neat, the large TV on the wall is a nice touch too. Bathroom has a nice spacious shower and all is clean and proper as one would expect. Internet is $10 for 24hrs which is a bit of a nag but acceptable. We didnt bother with breakfast at the hotel as you have numerous cafes around you with in meters from the hotel (Starbucks, Pret-a-Manger etc) not to mention being one block (yes thats right, one block!) away from Times square. We booked very late and this was the best we could get for the money and I must say it was a great choice. Patrick at the front desk was a delight to deal with and helped us where possible. Some of the other staff did come off more rigid so its a bit of a mixed bag. Also, advise given was that the standard rooms are very small and that a deluxe room is a must for longer stays. So if you're a couple then try and grab a deluxe with a king bed as it will make all the difference.","Prague, Czech Republic","Snorkeler76</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Prague, Czech Republic</strong>",15,5.0

Firstly the hotel is very well located for NYC first timers, roughly in the middle of Manhattan Island at 70 West 45th Street, between Fifth and Sixth (just west of Times Square). Secondly it is new (works were still being completed to the adjoining residences during our stay, they had no impact upon us though I note) and the rooms are accordingly clean and modern. The other thing about the rooms is, for NYC hotels (we saw several friends rooms), they are big. We had plenty of room for cases and luggage, something some of our friends envied very much! The hotel also has a gym in the basement which is functional, if not a little small. One thing we did not try during our stay was the restaurant, partly because it seemed a little pricy, partly because there were many options around the hotel (Starbucks across the street, street vendors outside and a short walk to the offerings of Times Square and Broadway). NYC also provides so many amazing food and entertainment options we were hardly in the hotel, we loved that city.

The bed was fine, nothing amazing but OK. The bathroom had a good rainfall shower and felt much bigger than it looked. Unfortunately, the crap ironing facilities deduct another point. The ironing board is two feet long, slides around dangerously on the worktop, and some glue stuck to the bottom of my iron ruined my shirt.

I immediately read the trip advisor reviews, so I was prepared to deal with the full size bed problem that others have detailed.I checked in, and was told that since I booked on Hotwire, I would be given a room with a full size bed. I asked for an upgrade, and the clerk told me $50 for a queen bed or $75 for a king bed. I then asked for a complimentary upgrade, and was told that that would be very difficult since their hotel has been sold out for months. Terrible reasoning, given that she already has indicated they have rooms with queens or kings available. She typed away for a while and continued to discuss the fact that hotwire bookings automatically get put in the smallest rooms. Then out of nowhere, she realized that the room that the computer had already booked me into was a room with a queen. So I said ""great"" and was ready to take the keys. She then had to radio up to staff to inspect the room. After waiting for 7-8 minutes, I was given my keys and we were on our way. Very long check-in process.The room was good. Large Flat Screen TV, good A/C, Queen Bed, Walk-in shower. Got ready and headed out for the night. After returning to the hotel around 2am, we got ready for bed. At 3:30AM, I woke up to the sound of someone sliding a key into my door and trying to open the door. By the time I got up and looked through the peephole, the person was gone. Strange. At 8am, we were woken up by VERY loud drilling above us. I called down to the front desk and they said there was no construction going on in the hotel. I told her there clearly was as I could barely hear her on the phone with the loud drilling. After 10 minutes the drilling stopped. Drilling noises were not a nice alarm clock, particularly after a night of drinking.The front desk arranged for a car service to JFK on the way out, which was helpful.Overall, Cassa is lucky to receive an Average rating.

The rate was $199 a night, not bad for midtown Manhattan! We stayed here from September 30th till October 1st. We absolutely loved it!We were looking for a place near Times Square but not right IN Times Square (too noisy). The Cassa is just a couple of blocks away--a quick, easy walk. We booked a standard room which had a full-sized bed. When we got there the concierge said ""I see that you requested a quiet room, so we upgraded you to a deluxe room at no charge"". Sweet!!! Let me just also say that everyone, from the valet who met us at the curb (we drove) to the ladies and gentlemen at the front desk, and every single person we came into contact with was genuinely warm, welcoming and attentive. The concierge handed us a list of special activities in the city that day and night (free Black-Eyed Peas concert in Central Park!) and many other suggestions for fabulous things to do. The next morning, we had a new one under our door.Our room was 2308. There's a very fast elevator, actually two of them. Walking down the hallway to the room, I thought, ""ho-hum"", didn't seem like anything special, but when we opened the door to the room, wow! The rooms have obviously been completely remodeled and are done in a very modern motif. Everything was stylish and functional--and beautiful! I told my husband I wanted a bathroom just like the one in our room, and took lots of photos to remember all the little details. (I do have photos and when I get them transferred from my camera I'll post them here).Everything you need is in this room. Refrigerator, safe, ironing board and iron, fax, really nice hair dryer, umbrella, wall mounted flat screen TV, MP3 docking station with remote, comfy leather chairs, high-quality linens on a bed that was heavenly to sleep in, thick terrycloth bathrobes on satin hangers for both of us, high-quality toiletries (the soap was so luscious and lathery I made sure to take the extra bar home with me). The rooms are not large, but big enough. The one thing I was disappointed in was that the high speed internet was not free--you had to pay at least $10 a day to use it. This is a pet peeve of mine with hotels. Internet access should be standard, not an add-on, especially in this day and age! However, everything else was so good I won't complain too much about that (and I did NOT pay the money to have internet access--just used my phone.) I didn't hear any noise all night from other rooms or from the street. It really was quiet, so if you want a quiet room, this is a good one.There's a cafe on the tenth floor with tables indoors and also outside on the Terrace. You can have breakfast there, or not. You can just sit there and relax on the Terrace if you want. Breakfast is very expensive, and the Cranberry Cafe is steps away on 45th Street and an amazing and inexpensive place for breakfast or any other time of the day. I highly recommend you walk over there!We had tickets for Jersey Boys and walked from the hotel to the theater, stopping along the way at Arriba Arriba Mexican restaurant at 762 9th Avenue. They have an early bird menu until 6 PM and unlike most prix fixe menus, the portions were full-sized (none of us could finish) and included an appetizer, and entree, and either a frozen margarita or sangria. The service was great and the food delicious. I had the quesadillas as an appetizer, the taco salad as an entree (shredded beef--not ground, and lots of it!), and the frozen margarita. Everything was superb. If you order the same thing you'll be happily surprised. All this for $14.95! Then on to the show, which was also great (don;t be afraid of the partial view seats in the last rows of the orchestra--you can actually see everything), then another walk back to the hotel.Check out time is noon. Valet parking is $50.00 and if you have a car I recommend it. Give them about ten minutes advanced notice and they bring your car right up to the front entrance when you want to leave.We had a wonderful stay and were so comfortable! We'll book this hotel again the next time we're in NYC.A couple of hints: If you absolutely have to drive to the hotel, it's on the left side of W 45th Street heading north, right before the intersection of 45th and 6th Avenue. (Between 5th and 6th Avenues) It has a cream-colored entrance that's easy to miss. It has the words CASSA written sideways on the outside wall next to the front revolving doors, so look for that. When we first drove up to the hotel, we couldn't see anywhere to go with our car--there's no place to park and no obvious signs for valet parking, so we had to go around the block again. I called from the car and asked what to do with the car and was told to just pull up in front of the hotel and they'd come out and take the car to the off-site parking garage. That's what we did, and the valet was waiting for us and waved us into a spot, then unloaded our luggage and handed off the car to a parking attendant.

These things happen anywhere and I was very pleased and impressed by the manner in which it was taken care of by the chef concierge, Nick. Please pass on my compliments to the management. The front desk people the last time I stayed there were also excellent.I like this hotel for its location 3 blocks from Bryant park and 7 blocks from MOMA. It is midtown without the extremes of Times square. The hotel is actually quite quiet and I love having that vest pocket park right across from the hotel. The rooms are fitted like a ship....not especially large but very well planned. The closet space could be larger but for a few days stay it's sufficient. The bathrooms are very european modern in the best sense. (love the rain forest shower head)The restaurant on the first level hasn't opened yet but the 10th floor suite they use for breakfast and cocktails is quite special in that it has this huge balcony you can sit on across from that vest pocket park I mentioned.Again, I was very pleased and were it not for the lobby area construction I'd give it 5 stars.Also please pass on my compliments to the management and particularly to the chef concierge, Nick.Gerard, Portsmouth NH","Portsmouth, New Hampshire","Gerard46209</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portsmouth, New Hampshire</strong>",7,4.0

Entering the one-bedroom unit, I thought something had been forgotten. Namely a personality. This looked like a place that had been on the market for awhile and had reluctantly been set up as a rental. If I was in the market for a NYC condo in a fantastic location - 45th and 6th - I would jump at this place. But I'd have to furnish.- Hardwoods throughout- Large living/dining area with a table, loveseat- Very nice modern kitchen with plates, glasses, but NO utensils. In this room, I guess you eat with your fingers.- Really nice bathroom- Nice sized bedroom with NO TV. I thought someone stole it- White stark walls with little decoration- Broken elevator for a 30+ story building leaving only one in working orderThis upgrade found me in a tremendously large room but while large, it was a shell. And the hotel should understand that some touches of warmth, decor and the usual necessities of a stay would put this place over the top in a major way. And it did make me wonder what the regular hotel rooms were like.Oh, and if someone did take the TV out of the bedroom, please return. Who doesn't like to fall asleep after a long day in the city with the glow of a TV.Woudl I return? Probably but it would need to be at a great rate.","Los Angeles, California","dbalex</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",32,4.0

We booked through booking.com about two months out and got a really good deal. The hotel was easy to find (despite lack of signage outside) and check in was quick and easy. Pros: The room was clean and modern with a great comfortable bed and large flatscreen tv. The shower was amazing and wish I had one at home! The room had a fridge/mini bar, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and a blow dryer. Staff were friendly and it was nice to have a list of things to do and the weather slid under the door each day. The hotel was in a great location with easy access to Times Square.Cons: 1) When we first used the bathroom I noticed that the floor felt like there was sand all over it. Wouldn't have noticed without bare feet. Also, old used soap was left in the shower. 2) When we went to store our drinks in the mini fridge, the door had been left ajar so nothing was cold and we noticed that it wouldn't shut at all. We told the front desk who sent maintenance to fix it while we were out. When we got back, we saw that while they rigged it to shut, the bottom seal still didn't touch and you were able to stick your fingers in while closed. Needless to say we didn't have any cold water during our stay, but didn't feel like complaining a second time. 3) We'd love free internet! Regardless, no con was a big deal or affected our view of the hotel!Overall, it was a great stay and we'll stay again when we go back to NYC!","Grove City, Pennsylvania","christie584</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Grove City, Pennsylvania</strong>",84,5.0

During last christmas NY colapsed with the tons of snow everywhere and traffic was impossible but we walked to everywhere with no problems.

I could not complain about the hotel's location one bit, as we were no more than 4 blocks away from Time Square, great as we'd been wanting to see a Broadway show that evening. The hotel staff was friendly (barring the concierge, which I will explain in a moment), the room clean (though fairly small - I didn't even realize until we opened the door to our room that double-beds were even an option much less the norm), and the shower amazing (one of the natural rain-type shower heads). Again, though the room was clean, it was small enough that the ~37"" LCD television felt too big to watch if that says anything. It lacked coffee in the room and in the lobby as well which I've come to expect in better hotels. As for the hotel's concierge - he was... obnoxious. We arrived at the hotel early that afternoon and were running out to get show tickets and asked him to get us reservations for some good Italian, quoting 'Babbo' (though knew getting a table would be next to impossible). I let the concierge know to try, and if not then to provide us with a small comparable selection. Coming back to the hotel the concierge asked what show we'd purchased tickets to to which we replied ""Bengal Tiger (...)"" and received a ""you wasted your money"" speech that lasted no less than 5 minutes. Excuse me? And what does he say for a restaurant, $70 for Chef Boyardee's best in my opinion.

It is worth having a look on priceline or hotwire since the hotel is quite often offered at significantly lower prices through the “veil of anonymity”. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a US credit card to try my luck but can’t really complain on the price I got for a 4-star hotel right in the middle of Manhattan.In terms of location, Cassa is ideal for walks to all Manhattan attractions. One block from Times Square (close but not too close to this central but really packed area) and 3-4 blocks from Grand Central Station, it was situated very close to restaurants, theaters, cafés, shops and museums. We are indeed very fond of walking around a new city (we feel we are getting most of the real city rhythm that way) and we never felt threatened when we were walking around there even when we were returning to the hotel late at night.The room was very cozy with modern decoration and all the amenities we would expect. Big and comfortable bed, huge TV with a great selection of channels, mini-safe, mini-bar, iron and ironing board, radio, etc. We were staying on the 18th floor but unfortunately our view was to the building right next to us so not much to see. One thing that I would like them to add is free WiFi in the rooms. I honestly cannot understand with today’s internet prices, why they need to charge USD 10 per day for internet access. OK, I understand that they are after the profit they lost when people replaced hotel telephones with mobile phones but still internet is so cheap these days. Don’t think that you will have a problem in finding a free wifi location though since there is a Starbucks right across the street where you can get a nice coffee and check emails on your phone/laptop.The hotel staff was really polite and helpful in the 1-2 things that we asked from them. The daily recommendation list from the concierge that they were leaving in our rooms every day was a very nice touch and twice we had dinner at these places and enjoyed it very much.All in all, we had a great stay at the Cassa Hotel and Residences and I would definitely stay again.

The only negative of the room is that it is lacking a kettle/cups which I think is basic necessity as many people want to drink coffee or tea (including me). I love how a note is always placed in front of the room every morning advising the weather of the day.Last but not least, location is perfect. Midtown, close to Bryant Park station and many attraction & shopping areas. We especially enjoyed our late supper at Chipotle (mexican food) just across the road, or the food cart round the corner of 42nd st/6th ave.I will definitely stay at Cassa if I even go back to NYC!","Sydney, Australia","nicloe09</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",6,5.0

We were delighted to find that we had been upgraded to a condo from a King room.The lifts were super quick and when we got to the room we were delighted. Very large bed which was extremely comfortable. A fully equipped kitchen and dining area, A large TV facing the bed, A walk in closet and a fabulous bathroom. Everything was spotlessly Clean. Plenty of towels and soap etc. Shower head is quite large which is nice in the mornings or after a long day walking about new york. The Bath is quite deep and great for a long soak to ease those muscles.Starbucks is straight across the street (free wifi) and Times square is a short walk away. You literally come out of the hotel, turn left, cross the street to the Irish pubs, and time square is at the next intersection. We could see the glow from TS at night from our room windows. If you turn right when you leave the hotel, you will come to madison avenue.The hotel was very quiet, virtually no street noise at night at all which meant a sound night sleep.The only negative I would have is that there was virtually no information about the hotel facilities in the room. There was a breakfast menu but that was it. There was no information about the cost of wifi or how to get it, there was no info about how much the drinks cost in the fridge, recommended restaurants close by, Local Doctor in case of emergencies etc…. that type of thing. Most hotels I have stayed in have a welcome pack with all relevant info enclosed inside. This might be a suggestion for the hotel to do in the future.Do take the time to do the Grayline tours. They leave straight from time square beside the TKTS Booth. The tour guides are very knowledgeable and you can hop on and off as you like.I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again when I return to NYC.Thank you Cassa Hotel for a great stay.",Ireland,"apples2008</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ireland</strong>",18,5.0

Room was very nice, clean, stylish, modern, equiped with different appliances. It had LG LCD screen, Apple dock, iron and ironing board etc. Bathroom was spacious and fancy. it had everything u need including proper blow dryer. it made some weird noise the first night we stayed so we asked the staff to replace it. and they did.Every morning the staff was leaving print-outs with weather forecast for the next 2 days, recommendations of the restaurants, museums and shops. we tried 2 of the restaurants tehy recommended an tehy were wonderful! you couldn't find a tourist in there, all the visitors seemed to be local. food, interior and atmosphere were excellent and prices were acceptable!Location of hotel is JUST PERFECT!!!! u r located extremely lose to everything w/o street being overcrowded like at TS location. we could easily walk everywhere and if u r not a very walkable type u could get a train which is not far either (different lines).I will definetely recommend this hotel to everyone!!!!",Kiev,"Polichka</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kiev</strong>",15,5.0

We opened the window but there was no screen and it was very loud. They charge for everything, including the corkscrew in the room, which I have never seen before. They charge what seems to be a lot for wifi, local calls and toll free calls.The girls at the front desk were very sweet and suggested a good restaurant for dinner one night. Unfortunately they also sent us to a liquor store at 10th and 42nd, which was a bit of a hike. We found out later there were at least 3 that were closer (just saw them while walking around). Also we wanted to try a specific restaurant, and they ended up making a reservation and sending us to the wrong place with a similar name. Not really their fault but it sucks when you only have a few nights.It was a good price (we paid 220/night over easter though hotwire) and you can't beat the location if you are a tourist.

The hotel is a block away from Times Square, few blocks from Rockefeller Center, Empire State building, Murray Hills, and Broadway. The staff (Kevin, Albany, and Eric) was very outgoing, knowledgeable, and friendly. Albany and Eric booked reservations for us from restaurants’ to a Broadway show. Kevin was very outgoing. Kevin helped us with our bags and provided us with details of the city. We stayed at the Cassa for four days and only experienced two small problems. The first problem was a clogged toilet. The second one was not receiving a wake-up call as requested. Before leaving the hotel for the evening, I informed a gentleman at the front desk about the clogged toilet and asked him to send someone up to fix it. The front desk person quickly told us that the problem had already been taken care of and not to worry about it. Now, I know the service is quick, but in this case--we had not informed anyone of the problem--we just assumed it was taken care of. After several hours sightseeing, we arrived back to the hotel and discovered that the toilet was still clogged. As a result, I called the front desk and informed a woman that the toilet was still clogged. Within minutes, maintenance was knocking on our door to fix the toilet. The second problem was in regards to the wake-up call. On our last night stay at the hotel, we asked for a wake-up call for 5:30 AM. The same person said he would notate the request. Unfortunately, we did not receive a wake up call until another person called our room the following morning (6:15 AM) to inform us that our car service was waiting for us downstairs. Other than those minor issues, I highly recommend this hotel for any traveler; solely based on its location and for the most part, their commitment to professionalism and customer service. Note:We were given a standard room and were offered an upgrade for a fee (50/75). We declined the upgrade. The room was tiny but comfortable. The bed was more comfortable than the Westin's Heavenly bed. In addition, I have read other comments about the closet space and found that there was adequate space in the clothing storage space provided.","Houston, Texas","lovetotravel318</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",64,4.0

Very convenient location and nice rooms and staff. I think the hotel is still missing things it needs to be considered a 4 star hotel. I was OK with our stay since I got a great rate on Hotwire but if I had paid more I would have been unhappy. The heat in the hotel was stifling and it made the room very dry. The hotel has no humidifiers available for guests. This is something I have been able to request from other 3 and 4 star hotels with no problem. The room is also missing an in room coffee maker, pretty standard these days. When I had a need for a missing toiletry item they had nothing to offer, but they did offer to send a staff member to go and buy it for me which was very nice. There is still construction going on in the hotel and I am sure it will be nicer when it is finished. One last missing item was free internet in the lobby. I have always been able to have that available in other hotels. I expect pay for this in my room but not the lobby. The hotel needs to have a proper concierge service. We asked for dinner reservations to be made at the front desk/ concierge and we were told that would be no problem. It was never done and when we asked if it was taken care of we were told the man handling it had left and would be back in the morning. We never heard from him and took care of it ourselves in the end but we were concerned we might have been double booked if he had indeed taken care of it. Overall I would stay here again if I had this low a rate but not for more.","San Diego, Ca","Mary L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, Ca</strong>",145,3.0

I'd done extensive research on hotels around Times Square, since I was traveling to Manhattan for a business conference and wanted to take in a Broadway show while I was there. So, for my price range, my expectations were that I was going to get a tiny room with a bed up against the wall, barely space to turn around, lots of street noise, and iffy service. Then I spotted a great deal for Cassa on Travelzoo, and the reviews on Tripadvisor looked good, so I decided to give it a try. Wow, was I blown away! I was upgraded to an executive suite, and the room was exceptional. Spotlessly clean, a fantastic view from the 27th floor (I could see right down the street to Times Square a couple blocks away), a small desk where I could work comfortably, and solidly reliable internet access, both wired and wireless. There was even an iPod/iPhone charging station right in the room, so all I had to do was place my iPhone into it and not only was it charging, but the room could be immediately filled with my favorite music. Even without music though, I had zero trouble with street noise, and there were adequate curtains to draw across the windows if I wasn't interested in the flashing lights of Times Square. Manager Patrick N. was extremely helpful, as was the housekeeping staff. The mini-bar was extremely well-stocked, with drinks and munchies and even a discreet ""intimacy kit"". The bathroom was enormous, clean and well-stocked (shampoo, lotion, bathrobe, hairdryer, etc.). No bathtub, but a gigantic walk-in shower, and water pressure and temperature were always good. The elevators worked reliably, and the hotel's location near Times Square was superb. It was a breeze to catch a taxi to the Convention Center, or walk to Times Square if I wanted to find a restaurant or buy discounted tickets at TKTS for a Broadway show, and all theaters were within walking distance. The only downsides to the hotel are minor, and I put them down to Cassa still being a relatively new hotel: The lobby is tiny, decorated but still has a bit of an unfinished look, with a curtain partitioning off the parts that haven't been completed yet. There's no bar or anyplace to really meet with someone in the hotel itself, though there are plenty of other suitable locations nearby. Another tiny pet peeve of mine is that in the bathroom, though the amenities were beautiful, the soap dish, though stylish, doesn't have drainage holes or ridges, so wet soap placed into the dish tends to just glue in place and become a soggy mess. Electrical sockets in the room were a small issue, as there are plenty near the desk, but none near the bed (but I asked for an extension cord and one was delivered within 5 minutes). Drawer space was also minimal. There was plenty of shelf space in the closet, and nightstands with a tiny bit of storage space, but personally I prefer to have a chest with deep drawers near the bed where I can easily store things from my suitcase. All of those issues were extremely minor though: Overall I was absolutely delighted with the room: I loved the view, I loved the location, I loved the service, and the value was superb. When I return to Manhattan, Cassa will be my first choice!","Derwood, Maryland","GamerGirl-MD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Derwood, Maryland</strong>",29,5.0

About 5 minutes later I received a hand written thank you note from the general manager (nice touch). I felt like the room decor was a little tacky and cheap, but the tv & bathroom made up for any of the room's shortcomings. Also the hallway from the elevator to the room was a bit dingy, dark, and cheap. Overall, for the location, value, and friendly staff, I would recommend this hotel.

I had booked through a third party site that offered a guaranteed upgrade, if available. Sure enough the friendly front desk person told me I had been upgraded to an Executive Room.I went up to room 2707, and what I noticed at first was that it seemed quite small. The king bed was only inches from the wall with curtained windows, and there was not much space on the opposite side either. It looked nothing like the spacious room pictured on the Cassa site, and I felt ridiculous having to smush myself between the bed and window to open and close the curtains.Next I noticed the television mounted to the wall. None of the TV input connections were accessible. This was troubling, as I had checked with hotel staff (both reservations and front desk) three times prior to my arrival to make sure I could attach an external device to the TV. I had been assured three times it would be no problem provided I had the proper connection cables. It was important, since I needed to watch some students' short films for a workshop I was facilitating. I called down to the front desk, and they sent an engineering staff member. He came in and told me rather curtly that I was ""out of luck"" and that hooking anything to the TV was not going to happen.I sent an email to the hotel's executive assistant, explaining my dilemma. She responded the following morning, informing me that she was going to assist me. Finally, later that day, someone attached a DVD player (provided by hotel) to the TV. This was useful. Unfortunately, in doing so, they managed to lock the TV so I could only use the DVD player and not watch any channels. The following day two engineering teams spent over an hour in my room trying to rectify the problem. It was never resolved.Cleanliness was also an issue. My first night, upon lying back in the bed, I noticed a strange aroma. It was like an industrial solvent-type smell. I discovered the culprit was one of the four pillows on the bed. It smelled as though someone had dumped a whole box of detergent on it. I removed it from the bed, replacing it the next morning with a card asking that the sheets be changed. When I came back to room, the bed was made but the case had not been changed--it still smelled. Afterward, I flagged down a housekeeper and asked him to remove the pillow entirely. He smelled it and agreed that something was very wrong with it.The first time I went to use the shower, I discovered several coiled black hairs (not mine) on the floor. What's more, the next morning when I opened my new shower-mat, there were longer curly black hairs inside of it. For the most part the staff was friendly and accommodating. However, during one of my many interactions with them, I mentioned to Patrick--a front desk manager--that my room was much smaller than advertised on their website. He told me I was mistaken. That I was not taking into account the large bathroom. According to him, even the smallest Executive Rooms were about 380 square feet.I was bothered by his condescending attitude. So, when I went back to room, I measured the square footage (my brother is a real estate appraiser, so I know precisely how to do this). The total? 238.4 sq. ft., including the bathroom. I was shocked, as this is actually less than what the Cassa claims is the amount of space in their smallest standard rooms. My upgrade was actually a downgrade to a room that shouldn't even exist.The difficulties mentioned in other reviews are true. The wait for an elevator can be extremely time-consuming. Parts of the hotel appear unfinished. The lobby is small and cramped. The thermostat is unreliable: I had to get up several times each night as it became either too hot or cold. Also, even though the windows are double-paned, traffic noise was audible on the 27th floor.After a volley of emails, the hotel's executive assistant did apologize for my many difficulties. And she offered me a 20% discount on my next stay. But I booked this stay for more than 40% off. I think it highly unlikely I would spend more money to return. In my opinion, for a hotel billed as a four-star property, the Cassa will need to make drastic changes in its service and cleanliness before it can hope to sustain the goodwill that brings repeat customers.","Sunrise, Florida","Nicolaus_Auf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunrise, Florida</strong>",6,1.0

The location is very good for mid-town meetings, nothing was more than a few blocks walk from the hotel.The arrival experience wasn't bad - after a long flight all I want to do is get checked in and crash in the room. Weirdly, there is ONLY a revolving door meaning if like me you have a carry-on bag it's tough to get through the door - seems like the idea is that you have to hand your luggage over to the bell man when you get out of the cab and they bring it in a different way. Problem with that is that I don't like to hand my bags over and I really don't like having to wait for them to be delivered to the room - plus it's only a carry-on. Small thing I guess. Check-in was efficient, however only one elevator was functioning and so each time there was a long wait to get up to the room - on one occasion there was a line of maybe a dozen people waiting more than ten minutes to get access to the lift. That's really not acceptable when you're paying $400 per night.Rooms were very nice - mine (1206) seemed to be part of a two-room suite (with 1205) so I guess if you were a family the setup would be pretty amenable.Small desk, armchair and little sofa as well as comfortable bed and nicely configured bathroom. Only issue I had with the room was that there were no instructions - e.g. nothing to tell you how to get internet set up, nothing to indicate if there was room service or what was available in the gym. Strange.I didn't try the gym or restaurant.Checkout was also efficient and the staff were generally friendly.","Jersey, United Kingdom","RusNewton</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jersey, United Kingdom</strong>",246,4.0

The bathroom had a vanity area, designer soaps and a huge walk in shower. The 42 inch plasma TV was great to watch from the bed. The hotel staff was so friendly and helpful. They would greet us each time we passed through the lobby and inquire upon our needs. The hotel is very close to Times Square, but so quiet I forgot I was sleeping in the middle of NYC.

Came back at 5PM and while I was upstairs in the room a maintenance man let himself in without even knocking. 15 minutes later a maid let herself in to place fresh orchids in the room, again without knocking. Bellman brought up one less bag than we had given him but promptly returned with the remaining bag. Rooms are very modern and nicely decorated but incredibly small. We had the ""Deluxe King."" There is a mini bar, fridge and safe. They give you a suitcase stand but there is hardly any place to set it up. We were on the 17th floor which was quiet and didn't hear any street noise but were also next to the elevator and did hear that occasionally. Shower was fantastic and they had nice amenities like a huge flatscreen TV which seemed even bigger because it was only 3 feet away from your bed. Also had a nice stereo system with satellite radio and iPod dock. There is a small gym in the basement with about 6 cardio machines of various kinds and some free weights and also towels and bottled water. Internet was reasonable at $9.95 per night. I told the manager of the hotel about our rough start and they comped us internet for the remainder of our stay and continental breakfast the next morning. They were quite apologetic and we didn't have any issues the rest of the stay. My fiance ran the marathon and they gave us a really late check-out at 4PM without any additional charge so that he could shower. The restaurant hadn't opened yet so I can't comment on that. Maid service was spectacular. Of special help were Carmen, Abraham, and Henry.
