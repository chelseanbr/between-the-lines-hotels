However, I would like to share with others on our wonderful experience of staying in Conrad Tokyo. The hotel staff were so attentive to your needs. The rooms were spick-and-span. Club lounge access had various food and beverage choices. The concierge team were especially outstanding in meeting our high expectations, last-minute arrangements on vehicles and itineraries reservations/bookings without a single sigh.","Singapore, Singapore","rawjak</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",6,5.0

Our first stay was 2 nights before New Years, so we knew that the hotel would likely be too full to offer such an upgrade. We were correct, but even though we were given a Standard King, which was what we had booked, the soft furnishings and decor of ALL the rooms at this fine property are top-notch, and we were happy to have the time to luxuriate in this wonderful room, with quite a pleasant city view, on our first night in town. (See my other review of the December stay, on this site).I reviewed the hotel after our first stay, because it was so wonderful, I didn't want to wait. Not only is the property stunning, but the location is wonderful too, on a couple main train lines, and near some pleasant, upscale shopping, and the Hamarikyu Garden.Apparently, the staff read my review at that time, and in order to try not to disappoint, offered us an upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite overlooking the Hamarikyu Garden and Tokyo Bay, on this second stay in January! They always say the true measure of a hotel is its people, and the staff at this hotel indeed made our stay wonderful! They knew we were coming back, and we were greeted with open arms. There is nothing like coming back to a hotel, and being treated like long lost family!Yohei, the Assistant Front Office Manager, came and welcomed us when we checked in, in the executive lounge, and told us the story of how they had seen our previous review, and despite the hotel being very full on this night, wanted to make it a point to see we were looked after, and had reserved a 1 bedroom suite for us. This night was ""coming of age day"" in Japan, when people turning 20 are celebrated, and hotel capacity is usually very full on this night.During the following 24 hours, no less than 6 staff on his team treated us as royalty, and were attentive and kind beyond the call of duty. The whole team is clearly quite proud of their hotel, and were happy to be able to accommodate loyal customers, something we very much appreciated!The one bedroom suite had sweeping views, a walk-through closet, between the living area and bedroom area, a monstrous bathroom with heated floors and separate shower and bath, with the bath having a TV in it, the shower having an overhead rose and a hand shower. I particularly loved the 10x10 Koehler sinks in the bathroom, with HansGrohe Faucets, and am searching for them now for my own home!I personally loved the desk/table in the living area, which was large and great for anyone having to do some work while staying at the hotel. And the sofa was generously deep and very comfortable after a long walk around Tokyo, as was the lounger by the window in the bedroom.The lobby is commanding, and has the most wonderful bar and lounge area, twenty-eight, which on both of our stays, was brimming with happy celebrations, music and laughter, which made for a very cozy atmosphere. You can get extravagant drinks and cute afternoon tea here, with a view and great ambiance.The highlight of the stay (besides the people, who really made the stay fantastic) was the breakfast. As Diamond Members, we were entitled to either the club lounge, or Cerise, the all-day restaurant. Of course, we chose Cerise where, in addition to the buffet options, we were allowed a choice off the made-to-order menu, which was extravagant. We had the omelet lobster fricasse on one occasion, and the croffle on the other (which had truffles... and was YUM).I have been to many of the more upscale hotels in Tokyo during my 9 trips to Tokyo over the past 15 years or so (Marriott Shinagawa, Westin, the other Hiltons), and out of them all, this buffet stood out above all the others for its high-quality, exapnsive buffet choices, as well as its extremely pleasant outlooks and ambiance... and once again, for the people. From chef to server, we were greeted with a smile and attentive service. Even the restaurant manager worked hands on with his staff, and cleared plates and engaged in pleasant chit-chat with us. This is something you don't see at many hotels these days.The Club Lounge offerings too, were pleasant. There were some fantastic wine collections, and the tea time offerings were very yummy cakes, puddings, and chocolates, as well as finger sandwiches.If there were any one thing that let down the hotel, it was that the evening club cocktails were full by the time we arrived, at the starting time, on the dot. We were asked to go back to our room and they would call us when a table opened up. We were told it would likely be around 15 or 20 minutes, but it was about 45 minutes.We were still able to partake of all the cocktail lounge had to offer at our late seating time, though staff were struggling to replace food items and clear tables.I don't blame this on the Conrad, I blame it on the patrons. We also stayed at the Hilton NishiShinjuku and the Hilton Odaiba during this stay, and experienced similar issues.It seems that people who book club rooms take extreme advantage of Hilton's generosity. We saw families of more than 4 people with several children under the age of 10 running around causing havoc. These families would sit around for hours eating free ""dinner"" and annoying other guests... and this was at all the properties. I would suggest tightening up rules around number of guests and duration of stay, at the very least, for Hilton Clubs in general, as a solution to this issue.However, once again, I can't say this was an issue with Conrad Tokyo specifically, it was a general issue with all the Hiltons we stayed at. I have seen it happen in US and China before, but not at previous stays at Hiltons in Japan, so it was sad to see.Aside from that one blip, we were so impressed with the pride all of the staff at Conrad Tokyo, and so grateful for the experience and generosity of providing us a 1 bedroom suite on this occasion.They say that great staff is supported by great managers. Clearly from the GM all the way down through management takes great pride in their work, and so do all of the people they support.We are looking forward to coming back for another pleasant stay when the world opens up again! The next time we hope to stay long enough to try out some of the other restaurants such as China Blue and Kazahana. I think we'll probably also try the Conrad Osaka on the next trip too!In all the stays I've had at upscale hotels in my lifetime, this may not have been THE most upscale (though it was right up there), but it did have some of the best quality offerings, and was my personal favorite of them all!Thanks once again, for a very upscale stay, but also for treating us as family!","Vallejo, California","tequilatamm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vallejo, California</strong>",122,5.0

There was the usual buffet, but also an a la carte menu with gourmet selections.

As we had a late evening flight the next day, we opted for a late checkout, which obviously meant an additional full day rate. The property is awesome, beautifully located near the busy Shimbashi Station and Oedo Line Shiodome Station, and overlooks the Tokyo Bay area & the Hamarikyu Gardens. Our rooms (3403 & 3407) on the 34st floor were very comfortable, quiet, intriguingly architected (rolling shades between bedroom and bathroom) and nice furnished, offered a stunning view on the bay which clearly represent the pièce de résistance of this location. We enjoyed a traditional teatime at the bar on the 28th floor lobby, which at evening features live music and a cozy fireplace.

Everything from asking how our day went, to making recommendations of fun things to see and do in the area. Tammer was especially helpful, and we certainly enjoyed that he made drink suggestions and brought them over himself. The pool and fitness area were impeccable, with the pool being on the 29th floor overlooking the city. The breakfast was amazing with all of the choices. Japanese and western with views of Tokyo.

What a wonderful spread of food and furthermore an excellent selection of drinks - Japanese whisky, gin and yamazaki.

They were both amazing, but Tokyo just takes it to the next level. This was by far the best customer service I have ever experienced. Everyone was super helpful without being pushy or snobbish. The property itself is the height of luxury. Elegant and sophisticated, but still welcoming. It's just what we needed after a 14 hour flight. As soon as we arrived, the staff were there to take our bags directly to our suite. During check-in we received hot towels and a welcoming soft drink. As soon as we entered our suite there was a plate of Japanese pastries waiting for us. We had a bay view, which was amazing! Waking up to sunrise over Tokyo Bay was a magical experience. We decided to use the pool/spa area the first night we arrived to help recover from the post flight fatigue. It was great to be able to relax in the steam room after all that dry air on the plane! All the facilities were immaculate with high-end toiletries and cosmetics. We had breakfast included as part of our stay. The buffet features a wide variety of Western and Asian options. You can also order off of a menu in addition to the buffet. Needles to say, we didn't need much to eat the rest of the day. I highly recommend the dim sum options. Delicious! We also treated ourselves to cocktails in Level 28 one night. Our drinks arrived with a complimentary bowl of baked cheese sticks and chocolate covered macadamia nuts, which was a lovely touch. The hotels is a short walk to shopping in Ginza and several difference transportation options. The staff at the Conrad were incredibly helpful is getting us taxis whenever we needed them. I can't say enough good things about my experience at The Conrad Tokyo. I really hope that one day we're able to make the long trip to Japan again to relive this very special experience.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Blonde_Clamshell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",12,5.0

Flawless in every regard.The lobby is on the 28th floor, and it makes for quite an entrance to the hotel. The ceilings are vast and the décor is perfect. Upon check in, we were offered welcome drinks. As Diamond member, I was offered check in at the executive lounge. Rather than pointing us in the right direction, the staff member walked us to the lounge on a different floor. She enthusiastically engaged us in conversation about Japan and our plans in Tokyo.We stayed in an executive corner suite. The room was spacious and pristine. It also offered spectacular views of the bay. We loved their amenities such as the Shanghai Mandarin lotions and bath products.Service at the executive lounge was great. We always felt cared for and welcomed. Drinks and food were of high quality. We opted to have breakfast in the lobby instead and this selection was also delicious. They offered a mix of Japanese and continental foods and everything we had was good.Special shout out to the Conrad Concierge for securing our omakase dinner reservations.

The food and drink options were of reasonable quality but were perhaps too Western and hardly exceptional--perhaps could be described as Hilton-level quality and not something unique or exceptional. In particular, the bar ambience was lobby-esque and the drinks were decidedly ordinary, in contrast to the Mandarin Oriental bar which is sleek and refined, and serves innovative world-class drinks.

Which has resulted in my spending just under 4,000 hotel nights thus far, mostly in very nice hotels. In the process of spending so many nights in hotels, it's natural for a person to become a bit jaded, and to not be particularly excited about yet another night in a hotel. And while I always deeply appreciate the hard work hotel employees do to make my hotel night, and every other guest's night a pleasant and memorable event, it can be just another night. At least, that is how I thought until I recently stayed at the Conrad Tokyo. This hotel *blew* *me* *away.* It started with one of the warmest welcomes I have ever received at a hotel, thanks to the absolutely extraordinary hospitality of Guest Relations Manager Yuka and her exceptionally talented colleague, Sarah. New Guest Relations recruit Francesca, who is outstanding and learning from the best of the best, also contributed to the wonderful welcome. They were all friendly, conversational and fun, and more like old friends than Guest Relations specialists. They created a deeply positive mood and atmosphere that lasted during my entire stay. While some veteran travelers can become demanding and even grumpy, I am the exact opposite. I just go with the flow, and am grateful for whatever I get. I never ask for anything special. To me, travel is much easier when you adopt this ""attitude of gratitude."" For some reason, Front Desk Manager Mr. Takagi decided, on his own and without my making any special request of any kind, that he wanted me to have a wonderful room. Maybe he just picked up on the ""attitude,"" and liked it. He worked his front desk computer hard, leveraging all his knowledge and expertise. Next thing, I walked into one of the most beautiful hotel rooms I have ever occupied in my life. It was my luxurious home for the next five nights, and what a pleasure it was. With amazing views of the harbor, a bed that was out of this world, and a bathroom that even billionaires only dream about. Thank you, Mr. Takagi. The entire Executive Lounge team, under the expert direction of Naomi, simply could not have been nicer. Each Executive Lounge professional was hard working, caring, helpful, friendly and pleasant. Once again, they were more like friends welcoming me at their home. I won't name anyone in particular because the entire team was terrific, and I would feel bad if I forgot someone due to jet lag. Thank you all. Mr. Takii, Breakfast Manager at Cerise, oversees the best breakfast buffet I have ever enjoyed anywhere in the world. He, too, has a wonderful team. Special mention goes to Anri and Yui, who provided the warm, gracious and hospitable service for which the Japanese people are so renowned and revered. Special mention, too, to Vincent, the super-smart Front Door welcome and bell person who went so far out of his way to greet me upon arrival, and to then wish me a safe journey upon departure. With excellent language skills and a big heart, he epitomized everything that is so wonderful about the people at this hotel. Finally, special recognition to Angelo, the Assistant Food and Beverage Manager, who is like a magical presence at the extremely popular and absolutely beautiful lounge in the sky, adjacent to the sky high lobby and reception area. I have never before encountered a Food & Beverage professional more in tune with and wanting the very best experience for his guests. It was a pleasure to speak with him. Unfortunately, I am forgetting to mention several other truly outstanding team members. The simple fact is that every single person I encountered at this hotel was superb. As you can tell from this review, to me, the team members at a hotel are everything. Even a standard hotel can be superb if the team members are superb. But this hotel is different. It is absolutely gorgeous in every respect, with every luxury and amenity a person could want. But in addition to this, the team members are off-the-charts superb, in every department. When you take excellence, and square it, and then square it again, you are able to take a surreal trip to the ""Blown Away.""

It was warming and welcoming. I was directed the elevator and then to the lobby. The minute the staff knows about my diamond status, we were escorted by Aisha ,an energetic young lady to the elevator and were soon greeted by Sarah.

This is our third stay in about 3 years. The hotel is located in a highly built-up business area in the Shiodome/Shimbashi neighborhood. Access to the hotel, especially for those who take the public transport system, is very convenient. The hotel is just next to Shiodome on Ooedo Line and Yurikamome Line. It is also a very short walk from the Shimbashi stations. The hotel is also served by the Airport Limousine Bus to/from both Tokyo area airports, though there is a lack of an afternoon/evening bus from Haneda to the hotel. We especially like the property because it is somewhat away from the craziness of Shinjuku/Shibuya/Ginza/Marunouchi tourists. For those who are brand new to Tokyo, the location may be a bit intimidating because it is not really possible to see the street from the ground floor entrance...it is part of a semi-undergound pedestrian system. The property backs against the Hamarikyu Garden and the Tokyo Bay beyond it, with a spectacular view from the hotel. Check-in was smooth and efficient as usual. Our room was clean, modern, comfortable, and well equipped. Breakfast, both in the executive lounge and the downstairs restaurant, was outstanding as usual.

The beds were quite comfortable and the bathroom was huge - with a separate bath and shower.The Executive Lounge was nice - albeit cut in half by the corridor which was a bit odd - and you had to be quick, and with sharp elbows to get your food - it was very busy and people were quick to take the offerings - not very refined to be honest. It didn’t feel like a Conrad experience in all honesty.Breakfast was where it all went wrong for us - we went to the hotel restaurant - Cerise - and it was shocking. Waiting for tables (despite the restaurant being empty, waiting 20 mins for coffee and reordering in order to get it, waiting 25 mins for an omelette to arrive) - all just poor staff organisation. I watched 2 people get up and walk out while we were waiting for food.

In this trip to Tokyo, I've stayed at places that are £30 a night, mid-range hotels and this, the most expensive of my stay which quite frankly, did not match up to its luxury status. Here are some things that irked me, because when I'm paying through the nose, I don't expect anything to irk me. - the hotel bar has seats by the window. On the twice I entered the bar, every seat was empty, but they told me I couldn't sit there because they were reserved. They remained empty for the entire time I was there.- at breakfast, every morning, I had to ask for my coffee three times.- the food was not good at breakfast, the room overcrowded, the area by the window nice, the other area, where I was mostly put, dark and depressing. The eggs were rank. The scrambled tofu was not scrambled tofu.- at breakfast I was embarrassed in front of a queue of people by being told I had to go and change my slippers/indoor shoes as they weren't allowed. I was sent away from breakfast- a huge deal was made about me not having a credit card. I wasn't allowed to use my debit card for a hold on the room which prevented me from charging anything to the room. Room service, for example (£20 for a bowl of soup) had to be brought up, card taken down and charged, then brought back. It made me feel like they thought I was going to steal something.- the TV in my room didn't work. - the shower in my room was full of limescale. - I wasn't allowed late checkout.- on my last day, I asked if I could sit in the bar if I wasn't drinking as I had time to kill, at reception they said yes. I was then asked repeatedly by waiter staff what I wanted to drink. This is the most attentive anyone has been all trip!

Yes, the hotel is luxurious but there's better Conrad's out there in terms of the hotel itself. The staff though, the staff is what earns Conrad Tokyo the excellent rating. I am hard-pressed to think of a more outstanding guest relations member I've EVER encountered than Peter at the TwentyEight bar.  He was incredibly gracious, generous and professional. He went above and beyond multiple times to ensure I enjoyed my stay. Thank you Peter. Miyako at reception made sure my check-in was as enjoyable as possible and Tamar in the executive lounge was extraordinarily helpful without me even having to ask for anything. He just naturally knew how to help. He ensured my husband who was joining me later in the trip would have a seamless arrival to our next destination. There was no need for him to voluntarily do this but yet he did. Amazing customer service!The staff was so exceptional I even convinced my husband and his friends to stay at the Conrad on our last nite in Tokyo (it didn't take much convincing given my raving about it). We already had accommodations at an AirBnB for that nite but when you can receive such care at The Conrad, you make the move. Especially when your team just won their quarterfinal game of the Rugby World Cup. You must celebrate and again Peter stepped in to make sure we all enjoyed our last nite in Tokyo.As for practicalities, getting around the city is easy as there are a couple of stations within a 10-min underground walk or less. Taxi to the Haneda monorail is a 5-min cab ride away. I got upgraded to a higher floor as there were no lower floor/bigger room upgrades available. When my husband and his friends arrived, we were generously allowed to check in early to get ready for the Springbok game.

Some people may say this hotel is a little away from the places you want to go, and is in the modern part of the city; but for me it was a nice change and lovely oasis, beautifully designed interiors with a nod to contemporary japan despite being an international brand. We were also being a little jaded from travelling and being my 4th trip to Tokyo the hotel was an incredible place to relax with vibrant restaurants and bars with excellent food, and funnily enough wasn’t filled with foreign tourists like some other well known hotel bars in the city, A lot of Japanese people dined and drank in the restaurants and bars which I really liked, similar to the Aman Tokyo. So this still felt like you were having an authentic experience without the need to rush out. Also it has a metro stop right underneath and actually got us using the underground to pop to my favourite places on my last day in the city; which was great.

Our expectations were low because the Conrad is affiliated with a brand of hotels that we don't typically think of as being in this category (Hilton). If there was such a thing as a star hotel, the Conrad would be in it. The facilities are top notch, the room was nicely appointed with a spectacular view of the Tokyo bay. The breakfast in the morning was particularly noteworthy with both Japanese and Western options. Best of all, though were the people. On the first night of our trip, we were be-friended by the Bar Captain, Peter, who not only made sure that we were taken care of with great seats and service at the bar (we aren't big bar people, but we went there at the end of each evening just to see him!), but also took an interest in where we were going and what we were doing in Tokyo, He was a great ambassador for the hotel and for the City of Tokyo and made us feel very special and welcomed in both his hotel and the city. On our first evening, we had dinner in the hotel (mostly because we had just arrived and were quite jet lagged and just needed food). Much to our surprise, the hotel restaurant served top notch food that compared favorably to the other great restaurants that we visited during our trip. When the travel agent originally suggested the Conrad, we questioned the choice. Ultimately, we decided to trust her and we were so glad that we did. The Conrad is a gem...and unlike other 5 star hotels, it really felt like a hotel that could have been no where else other than Japan.

However, Hilton was offering a status match (I matched to Diamond) and I had some Hilton points so I thought I would stay at the Conrad Tokyo which has apparently always been ranked near the top hotels in Tokyo. I was very much looking forward to this stay. I stayed here for 3 nights as part of a 9 day Japan trip (coinciding with my birthday) with my family (with two small kids) which took us first to Tokyo and then to Kyoto. I was also recently in Tokyo in October 2018 where I stayed at the Ritz Carlton and had a fantastic experience.After this stay, I left quite disappointed and I think there are a number of flaws that were exposed and need to be highlighted. First, I want to touch on the location of the hotel itself. It is indeed convenient to Shiodome station which is right next door, but getting to Shimbashi station is another story. It is a complex web of elevators/walkways/buildings which make it difficult to find the right direction. The front line staff at ground lobby do a commendable job in providing directions to Shimbashi (amongst other places) but I found they sometimes struggled to provide clear directions to something that should be straightforward (like, how do I get to Shimbashi station from here?). In general I found it difficult to find my way around the neighbourhood because something as easy as crossing the street required going up a series of elevated walkways. At the Ritz, they always gave out maps or drew maps for the guests - why not do the same at this property? Secondly, I was also concerned about the training of the staff with regard to how they deal with small children. I felt like children were treated as a nuisance compared to the rest of the clientele. Yes I have a 3 and a 5 year old , and while they're generally well behaved, they also just stepped off an 11 hour plane ride into the humid summer weather, and they're going to have their moments. There is a pretty flower display in front of the Cerise restaurant and when the lineup for breakfast is 10 deep, they're going to want to explore . Instead of sternly telling the children to ""not touch"" in front of me (who is already trying to stop them from touching), it would be helpful to engage them and draw their attention to something else. There were a few friendly staff who we encountered (I think it was a Filipino lady who I cannot remember the name of unfortunately, who worked in the restaurant who was especially kind) but in general this was few and far between. This was one of the most disappointing aspects of my stay. After I left Conrad, we went to Ritz Kyoto where it was immediately clear that the staff valued children and went out of their way to make them feel welcome (special kids programs daily, free ice cream, etc) and were so wonderful with children. The difference between what we had at the Conrad was night and day. Thirdly, and somewhat related to my point above, I thought that the general demeanor of the staff was rather cold. I was rarely greeted by name when I came back (the staff at the Ritz ALWAYS greeted the guests by name) and it wasn't really a welcoming environment to come back to. Finally, I want to share an experience which I thought highlighted a major flaw of this hotel. My wife inadvertently forgot some gym shorts at the hotel but we didn't realize this until our 2nd last day in Japan (by which time we were in Kyoto). I emailed the hotel and they confirmed that we had indeed forgotten the item and offered to send it to us. By this time we would have been traveling overseas and the cost to send the item would have outweighed just buying a new pair of shorts. It is obviously our fault that we forgot an item and it's not the value of the item that is important. However, I thought it was blatantly irresponsible that if a guest were to forget something, the hotel would not proactive. Instead it took FIVE DAYS and I had to initiate the conversation for them to inform me that I did leave something. Does anyone actually think that this is acceptable at such a high end hotel? For an example of how it's done right, when I was at the JW Mariott in Seoul in October 2018 and also inadvertently forgot something. Within a FEW HOURS of checking out I had received an email to let me know that I forgot something and asking how they could get it to me! And other (relatively) minor things - having Diamond status did not come with any room upgrades (I suppose HIlton has too many elites) though they were kind enough to offer a complementary cake for my birthday. The Conrad also has a decent breakfast spread and as a Diamond I could order off the menu as well. So in conclusion, it's probably the top Hilton in Tokyo but certainly not among the top hotels overall. You will see that I have compared my experience here to the one I had last year at the Ritz Tokyo which was superior in almost every way. I assure you I am not getting paid by Mariott to write this, I am only speaking from my personal experience. For Conrad, a hotel that aspires to be one of the top in Tokyo, it's certainly got a way to go and improve on","Vancouver, BC","PCTH_PhD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, BC</strong>",27,2.0

From minute one, we knew it was going to be a great experience. Every member of the staff with whom we interacted was professional, warm, and incredibly kind to our two young children (aged almost 3 and almost 1). Reminiscent in many ways of the Ritz Carlton Hong Kong, the hotel’s lobby is on the 28th floor, as are the three restaurants and a very nice lobby lounge. On the 37th floor is the Executive Lounge which, due to Hilton Honors Diamond status, is where we found ourselves shortly after arriving at the hotel. Jiew welcomed us to the lounge, showed us to a table overlooking the famous Hamarikyu Gardens, and brought us some light refreshments while she prepared our check-in paperwork. Despite the fact that our free night certificate equated to a “standard room reward”, we were upgraded to a King Suite Bay View, which was absolutely perfect. The room was amazing, and we were able to keep the kids in separate spaces so they didn’t wake/keep each other up - this made a huge difference and I truly appreciate the Conrad staff going out of their way to ensure we were comfortable. Besides Jiew, other staff members who made a lasting impression included Sarah, who was so sweet with our daughter on multiple occasions, and the Assistant Front Office Manager Yohei Asano, who spent so much time during our breakfast at Collage ensuring we (and especially our son) had a fantastic meal and wanted for nothing. Finally, a big thank you to all the staff at the Executive Lounge - truly an amazing group of professionals. During our stay, we had the opportunity to dine at all three of the main restaurants (though Collage only for breakfast, so did not sample the haute French cuisine for which they are known). All the food was thoughtfully prepared and delicious - exactly what you would expect from a hotel of this caliber. It is clear the Conrad Tokyo puts a great deal of time into ensuring their guests feel welcome and cared for, and I can say without question that every aspect of our stay was exceptional. We will absolutely be staying at this world-class hotel the next time we come into Tokyo.","Anacortes, Washington","hamishpwk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anacortes, Washington</strong>",6,5.0

On one of the days of our stay I had to book different type of room from what we needed (we needed two beds as it was me and my 20 yo daughter), and the hotel reached out to me through the e-mail and assured they would give us a room with two beds for all our stay and we would be able to stay in the same room all the days, without the need of switching rooms.When we came to the hotel the great experience continued. I am Hilton Diamond, and in US you never get too much of a value for a status, at least I never did. But when you are abroad - that's when you are happy you have the status. We were upgraded right away to a bay view room with two (!) beds on the 34 floor as I always ask for higher floor. The view was so great - like whatever I thought Tokyo would look like in my imagination - that was what the view was: the bay, the park, the skyscrapers and neon on the distance. When I first came into the room I was just sitting at the sofa next to the window for a little while taking in the view.The room had everything one can possibly need: a lot of toiletries, tea pot, electric kettle, fancy coffee machine, tea and coffee and the small fridge (which was actually a part of the mini bar, but we were able to put our stuff on top of the hotel's stuff when we needed). The design of the room also was very cool. The foyer had wooden floor, the shower had two shower heads - rain shower and the portable one. When we came into the room for the first time - there was rubber Conrad duck on the bathtub and cute Conrad bear on the bed - my 20 yo still is a child, she was so happy :)))Being Diamond we got a choice of breakfast - downstairs or in the lounge. We mostly ate downstairs as we like bigger selection to have something different every day. But on the check-out day we went for breakfast to the lounge - and it was pretty amazing compared to lounges in the US: there was even a chief there making omelets and eggs to order. Breakfast downstairs was pretty impressive too: great variety of European and Asian options, everything was absolutely fresh and tasty.The lounge was such a great option too. You could get soft drinks and juices there any time. But during certain hours in the evening they would serve alcohol and hot items - small but very tasty, and for us two it was often enough that we would not even need to go to dinner.But even better - is the stuff. Everybody we encountered in the hotel was highly professional, genuinely warm and friendly. The quality of service was outstanding to the degree that it was not just Japanese hospitality (which is impressive to begin with) - but it was just very attentive and delicate service. The personal in the lounge were our favourites - I wish I would remember the names but I am really bad with names. Also the maitre at the breakfast downstairs (again I don't remember the name but I remember that it was an Italian gentleman) - was just such a pleasure to communicate with. Even the gentlemen who was handling the limousine bus departure and tickets on the ground floor - was efficient, fast and very professional.Thank you VERY MUCH, employees of Conrad Tokyo - you are amazing!We will definitely be back!

In Tokyo we stayed at the Conrad in a two bedroom executive suite facing Tokyo bay. I had arranged transportation from Haneda airport to the hotel through the concierge and that played out painlessly after 12 hours in the air. Upon arrival we were met by several staff and one of the guest managers who is actually the Chinese guest relations manager and goes by the name ""Simon"" for us Americans. Simon showed us to our room, explained all the amenities the hotel had to offer including the location and hours of the executive lounge, and helped us get settled in. After we unpacked, we were ready to go start exploring and Simon again helped us with maps of the area, ideas, and a map of the subway system which I highly recommend using as it is cheap, clean, quiet, and very organized. I can say I really hate when a hotel puts those ""green"" thermostats in rooms that limit your temperature range, and shut off if no motion is detected for a time. This hotel does not use those and you can set the AC to freeze your brains out if you wish which we did. Our room also had a small kitchen area and a washer/dryer which we used several times to keep up a supply of clean clothes. The room was very nice and had outstanding views of a ground level garden/teahouse area as well as Tokyo bay. We heard no noise from the hallways or from other rooms. The only thing you could hear on occasion was the trains running on the nearby tracks but it wasn't loud and didn't bother us at all. The executive lounge had a good breakfast, mid day snacks, and evening cocktails with things you could actually use for dinner if you wished. The lounge also had a nice view of Tokyo Bay in one of the two lounge rooms. The staff there in the lounge were very attentive and also helped with ideas for things to see and do. We came back several evenings from day trips so worn out that we ordered room service for dinner on two occasions. The menu had American, Japanese, and Chinese offerings. We found the room service food quality, timeliness, and overall experience to be excellent in all respects. The location of the hotel is really in a great spot with close proximity to the subway and rail system as well as being near the multiple streets of ""street food"" shops that the locals hit after work. We walked down every alley we could find in that area and I can say that at no time did we ever feel unsafe day or night. We interacted mainly with Simon and another manager named Paweena. Both of them were excellent representations of the hotel and it's goal to make you feel at home. We left there after 5 nights to go to South Korea and do a DMZ/JSA tour to see the North Korean border area. We then came back to Tokyo for our last night before flying back to the US and were made to feel home again right away. Based on our experience I can highly recommend this hotel as a great place with beautiful rooms and an excellent staff. We would definitely stay here again whenever we get back to Tokyo.","Appleton, Wisconsin","Joe H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Appleton, Wisconsin</strong>",10,5.0

We recently completed another vacation with stays in the Grand Hyatt Taipei, the Westin Seoul (should not even be included in this group of hotels because we would not return), the Conrad Tokyo, ANA Crowne Plaza Kanazawa, and the Kai Matsumoto--so we had a chance to compare several hotels. The Conrad Tokyo is not only by far the best of this group, but we truly believe the Conrad Tokyo is the best in all our travels around the world. We had two stays during our 8 days in Japan. First for 3 nights, then we returned 3 days later for another 2 night stay. Both times, the service was amazing! And both stays, the Conrad generously upgraded our rooms as Hilton Diamond members. The first stay we were upgraded to Executive King rooms with amazing bay views, and the second stay, they were super generous in upgrading us to an Executive King Suite with a bay view! Talk about WOW! The GM actually took the time to ask us when we would be back from sightseeing so that he could personally welcome us to the Conrad in person when we got back to the hotel. He also sent an email during our stay to check in with us. What a generous thing for the GM to do, to send us an email on a Saturday to check in on us! Contrast that with the Westin Seoul. I asked the concierge staff for the the GM's email so that I could provide the hotel with some feedback, and they are refusing to give me his email! It makes sense now why we felt the staff at the Westin Seoul didn't really care about customer service! It comes from the top and clearly the GM there doesn't care to get feedback from the guests! That made us appreciate more the Conrad Tokyo's service!Our friend Susan traveled with us on this trip, and she could not stop praising how amazing the service, the rooms, the Executive Lounge, the breakfast, just how amazing everything was at the Conrad. She was especially impressed that after stepping foot in the Executive Lounge for the first time and confirming her name and room number, it seemed like everyone in the Lounge addressed her by name for the rest of our two stays--even if she hadn't yet met them yet! It seems like such a small thing, but it was those little personal things that really set the Conrad apart. But on top of all that, there is the AMAZING Mieko--one of the concierge team members at the Conrad Tokyo. She provided over the top amazing service back in 2016, and she did it again for this trip. She started helping with plans almost a year before our arrival. She helped us pick the restaurants to try (with so many to choose from in Tokyo, that's a tough decision) and snagged us reservations at Ryugin, Sushi Yoshitake, and lunch at Ginza Hirayama (of the three, Ginza Hirayama is a must try!). She made dinner reservations for us in Kanazawa and Matsumoto (and sake tour reservations and Ninja temple reservations). I mention that because in Kanazawa and Matsumoto, even though I reached out to the hotel staff in those cities, it was Mieko who was the most responsive and helpful! So she ended up helping us more than the hotel staff in those cities! Mieko also remembered my partner's birthday is in April (from our visit in 2016), and she arranged a wonderful spread in our room to help him celebrate his birthday month! Honestly, Mieko has been such a standout that we are now almost always left disappointed by the other concierges at hotels around the world! We can't wait for our next visit, hopefully in 2021!","Dallas, Texas","Hoong Nan Y</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",101,5.0

The room size was critical when choosing a hotel in Japan because most hotel rooms were not as large as those in other countries. The bay view room of Conrad Tokyo was very spacious and thus left plenty space for three people living together. The location of the hotel was extremely convenient. It was just beside the Shiodome station where you could access to the New Transit, Yurikamome line and the Toei subway line. Around 5min walk, you reached the Shinbashi station from which you could go to almost anywhere in Tokyo through the JR line and the Tokyo Metro line. I have to mention Odaiba. If you travel with kids, Odaiba may be a good place for entertainment, shopping, foods and etc. You could either take the New Transit train at the Shiodome station or the Shinbashi station, the terminal station. Also, the hotel was near Ginza, the iconic place of Tokyo. Hamarikyu park was just across the street though we did not manage to go there due to tight schedule.Japanese 5 star hotels are always proud of their service. Conrad Tokyo also exhibited the high standard of Japanese service. From day 1 to the last day, form check in to check out, from your luggage sending into your room to your luggage sending to the airport limousine bus, you would notice that the service was full of details to make you feel comfortable. Staff were polite, professional and keen to help. If you asked for something, staff will respond fast. I’d like to mention Yamazaki san from the front desk, Kaori san as well as another young lady from the restaurant, the lady at the gym who gave my daughter an ice pack.Food was carefully prepared and the culinary team would change the menu a little bit every day. Omelet was top notch. If you could eat natto, they had Japanese style omelet and tasted interesting. Conrad Tokyo was very much impressive and we will be back.","Beijing, China","UrbanReality</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beijing, China</strong>",25,5.0

It's busy in the day but dead in the night- and all underground access is out after 0000hrs. Closest Family Mart is just across the street but to get there 'legally' is a hassle. Nearest smoking area is just by the entrance of the hotel and most food outlets for late night dinner is around Shimbashi train station area- roughly about 15 minutes walk. The building itself cojoins with offices and eateries but neither are connected within the hotel and much of it closes by 8 pm. The gym equipment has been well maintained and they do have personal trainers. As for the room, the bedroom and the bathroom are pretty spacious, the bed is comfortable and for the city view, however, is 'blocked' by the adjacent buildings. Technological wise too, such as mirroring TVs or usb ports are in lacking. Now for the wholesome experience- I love Japan, and especially so their culture, their history and most of all the people, and in the case for Conrad Tokyo, its people truly shine for their services. Every time I walk past their lobbies or having breakfast, I will be greeted with salutations and smiles, over and over again- sometimes even from a distance away, ever so eager. That human connection provided by each one of them, and as a whole- truly amazes me and for that itself, from the bottom of my heart, I would like to say thank you to Conrad Tokyo Team for such a wonderful experience. Indeed, a warm smile is the universal language of kindness. :)","Singapore, Singapore","recklezzBERRY</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",11,5.0

This perk was incredibly appreciated. The hotel was also very helpful in forwarding our luggage to our next destination, and we were very comfortable in our beautiful room. The location was also perfect -- very conveniently located next to several subway lines, making transportation around the city incredibly easy.The one part of our experience that we didn't love was an evening visit to Twenty Eight, the hotel's lounge in the main lobby. The views are stunning, and as we came back exhausted from our sightseeing one day, we decided to just eat at the restaurant and have some drinks before calling it a night. We ordered two old fashioneds, and were served exceptionally sweet drinks adorned with pineapples, cherries, giant orange slices -- really a whole panoply of fruit. It was the right idea -- the drink had bourbon and a perfect cube of ice -- but not the execution we're used to. I was going to overlook this, as maybe it's not a popular drink choice in Tokyo and the bartender might not have been familiar with it, but we were also disappointed with our food.Advice -- book the hotel, but skip TwentyEight.","New York City, New York","laf2travel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",21,4.0

The space can get crowded and there were several instances where we waited exceedingly long for coffee (and subsequent refills), so a table carafe or self serve would've been welcomed. Either way, a plentiful spread to get the day started. Executive Lounge: wonderful staff and sufficient offerings. Two sided space with city and Tokyo Bay views to choose from. Breakfast offerings are generally the same as main restaurant, but on a smaller scale. On par with most executive lounges that offer you a space to get snacks, drinks and quiet time. Location: Walkable to Ginza area, but metro probably slightly faster. Pedestrian covered walkway access to two stations. ""walkway"" also includes access to a Starbucks, McDonald's, FamilyMart, TacoBell. It's a 7-10 minute walk to the stations, but easy enough to navigate. In cold months, it's probably quite cold during this walk. Staff: probably the highlight of an already fantastic stay. Every staff member we encountered was a complete joy to be around. We did not use restaurants for meals other than breakfast, and did not use the lobby bar - although many people did and it looked to be quite good. Also did not use the fitness center/pool, but we explored it. The fitness center has a lot to offer, but the pool is a 2 lane lap pool that appears to require lap swimming. No hot tub.

He was incredibly helpful in making sure that our last day went smoothly and he took care of her luggage. Very strange to find out that he had spent some time in Toronto and was best friends with another hotel manager that we know from Toronto, former Ritz Carlton manager Bastian Germer.

Lovely stay, unexpected upgraded room with complimentary breakfast (pls note Ritz is not participating in diamond upgrade nor complimentary breakfast). Hand writing greeting card from our concierge and got us reservation to dine at Sushi Jiro in Ginza.Moving to Conrad for the rest two nights as I’m a Hilton diamond member and have enjoyed my Conrad experience at Maldives, Osaka, and Manhattan. Wasn’t expecting an upgrade since it’s cherry blossom season but still got a notification in the Hilton app saying that I’m upgraded to 3403 bay view room on the night before my visit.Everything looked perfect until I checked in, I was notified that they didn’t have the upgraded room prepared for me and gave me room basic 3528 which was assigned to another Hilton member (there was typed greeting card addressing to Robin G. on the desk). Understandable if the hotel was fully booked to offer upgrade but it is unacceptable they sell the room which was already assigned to customer. Shady operation......I spoke to the front desk about the problem but they just blamed it to the system/app...unprofessionally handling the situation. Not going to discredit friendly front desk and lounge staffs, but definitely avoid Conrad unless you want to experience people checking into your room/you checking into other people’s room or given benefits being taken back/double sold.Unrivalled Ritz experience, especially comparing to Conrad...Location wise Ritz Ropponggi is so much better/convienet with malls, restaurants and tourist spots. Plus, Midtown cheery blossom is right beneath the hotel.As for now, I’m ‘offered’ for the originally assigned room for ‘one night’ as the they claime the whole property is fully booked. Sorry but I think they should check the Hilton app more frequently before making such statements...still bunch of availabilities out there, with the basic room selling at a discount rate for same date check in....So in short, totally worth it to pay a bit extra to stay at Ritz!!",,Francchi0330,3,1.0

As on previous visits, the hotel absolutely wins on service – it was outstanding. The hotel was great; however, rooms could use an update.Room 3544: I don’t know if this was classified as a “suite” or an over sized king room. Large windows and I had a marginal view of the water, but then, views from a hotel room are not important to me (if I’m not looking directly into brick wall and/or there’s limited natural light). Looking out to water doesn’t do much for me. Light is important, however, and there was plenty of natural light coming into this room. The primary view from this room looked toward tall buildings. There was a living space with ample furniture and around the corner were two queen beds. (Maybe full beds; can’t remember.) There was no door separating the bedroom from the living space, but you couldn’t see the beds from the living space. While the room had enough space and somewhat comfortable, it could use an update to its furnishings. They’re a bit worn around the ages and slightly dated. (I hadn’t seen a DVD player in a hotel room in a very long time.) There was no formal desk, but the small, round table was fine for computer work. However, the available electrical outlets were not close, so I had an issue with ensuring I didn’t trip over the cords. They scored high for having a tea kettle in the room (yeah!) and very good English breakfast tea. Like another recent hotel room, there was no closet in the bedroom. It was inconvenient to walk through the living space to get to the closet, which was near the entry door. The bedroom did have a chest of drawers, but they were shallow. The bathroom was a good size and I always favor a separate water closet, i.e., closed off from the rest of the bathroom. Loved the shower, which had more than adequate water pressure. Nice soaking tub, but I’m not a tub guy. Overall, the room was fine, but I think it’s time for a refresh.Service was great!! Check-in/check-out, room service (food was good/very good), the Executive Lounge, the front door persons, the concierge desk, the gift shop, the maître d’s in the Cerise restaurant along with the wait-persons. It was all top-notch. Kudos to Simon and everyone else: friendly, helpful, personable; always trying to find a way to assist you or helping you solve a problem. In my case, I came to Japan without a tie! After exploring whether to leave hotel to find one, they opened the gift shop a bit earlier so I could select a tie. Worked out perfectly. Thank you.Other: The Executive Lounge is small, but that was OK. On this visit, it was never crowded. Service, of course, was just wonderful. Good array of different types of food along with excellent presentations. The gym was also small but had enough equipment (and not crowded) during the visit so it was fine. It was a great stay. I’ve stayed at several Conrad’s and this one tops the list for me.","San Francisco, California","Apollo P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",154,4.0

From the moment you arrive, all the way to your departure, every staff member treats their hotel guests like true VIPs.Service: This is truly where the Conrad shines. Our car pulled up to the Conrad at around midnight and we were instantly greeted by 3 extremely friendly staff members. All of them were wearing white gloves and assisted us with our luggage and escorted us to check-in. I was chatting with the woman who was assisting us with our luggage, and I told her how excited we were to be in Tokyo (being our first time) & I asked her some of her favorite places around town. She wished us a warm welcome & politely told me concierge can help with all recommendations & reservations. I later find a hand written note from this woman in our luggage, wishing my boyfriend and I a wonderful stay and how she was very sorry she couldn't assist with recommendations and wrote down to concierge number. The fact that the woman who helped us with our baggage was dedicated enough to write us a hand-written note really shows how every staff member goes above and beyond. After our 2nd or 3rd day, the staff members in the restaurant started to remember our names and greet us by our names every morning. After our 5th & final day, we were eating our last breakfast before check-out and the manager of the restaurant folded us an origami crane & presented it to us as a gesture of kindness to wish us safe travels on our next destination. The service at the Conrad was so spectacular, that when we checked into our next hotel (the Four Seasons Kyoto) we were disappointed the service was not as good, even though the Four Seasons was 3x the price of the Conrad. The Conrad truly exceeds the standard of service for all hotels in Japan.Rooms: We booked a Corner Room Suite and were blown away by the views, the spaciousness, and the luxurious finishes. I love interior design & this room was covered in stunning art, Macassar wood millwork, silk wallpaper, automated shades/drapes & beautiful marble in the bathrooms. Our favorite part of the room were the heated bathroom floors! If you love a good view from the shower/bathtub, definitely book the corner suite! Food: The breakfast buffet was absolutely incredible. They had different stations with Chinese, Japanese, Korean, American, & European breakfast options. In addition, the waiter gives you a menu for 1 additional complimentary entree (per person) prepared in the kitchen. The breakfast buffet served at the Conrad was far superior than the breakfast we had at the Four Seasons Kyoto. All in all, The Conrad Tokyo is a true hidden gem! Because of the incredible staff & service at this hotel, we had the best trip of our lives. We now plan on coming to Tokyo every year and plan on staying at the Conrad every time!

We husband has stayed here a few times for work and for fun before this trip, and he always came back to the same hotel every time. This was my first time in Tokyo, and I was very glad that we stayed in Conrad Tokyo.The hotel is very close to Shiodome subway station for multiple lines. It is connected to the station underground, so you can walk inside if it is bad weather. It was a bit cold when we were there, so we were very glad to walk inside on the way to the subway station.The service was beyond our expectation. I emailed the concierge to ask for some help on restaurant reservations a few months ahead. I kept adding more restaurants and Emailed the concierge multiple times, and they were always very helpful and patient. They tracked when the reservations were open and followed up on time. They got us in for lots of hot restaurants. It saved us lots of hassle dealing with reservations from a different timezone. I mentioned to the concierge that we were here for our honeymoon beforehand. After we arrived there, we got upgraded to a better room, and the bed in the room was decorated with rose petals and a photo frame with some of our engagement photos. The hotel also sent over some free dessert as a gift. Every time we went to the front desk or saw the lobby manager, they were super friendly and always asked about our experience or if we had any concerns. The whole experience staying here was very pleasant.We will come back to Tokyo in the near future, and will definitely stay here again!",California,"YingXY</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",32,5.0

Overlooking the historic Hamarikyu Garden as well as soaring skyscrapers, the 290-room hotel is minutes away from both Shiodome Station - a stop on the Yurikamome line which connects you to nearby Odaiba, the popular island entertainment destination in Tokyo Bay - as well as Shimbashi Station, which connects to JR and metro lines.CONRAD TOKYOThe hotel occupies the 28th to 37th floors of a skyscraper in Shiodome, with lead-in rooms starting at 48sqm (certainly spacious for a Japanese property). As you make your way towards the elevators which will bring you up to the hotel lobby, your olfactory senses will be immediately aroused by the arrestingly distinctive Bottega Veneta fragrance which permeates the ground floor lobby and sets the stage early for your upcoming experience of luxurious sophistication.The hotel houses five distinct dining concepts, costume jewelry boutique ABISTE, a fitness centre equipped with treadmills, weights and an aerobics studio, as well as an elegant and very inviting 25-metre heated indoor pool which holds infinite possibilities for meditative zen and tension-charged romance.Mizuki Spa offers Japanese-style treatments using local essential oils, with jacuzzi, steam room and sauna facilities available to all adult hotel guests. Unlike other Japanese properties, the hotel is not too fussed about guests having to partake in the traditional Japanese bathing ritual - think mandatory nudity, stool seating and wooden buckets - or be entirely naked whilst using the aquatic facilities. I shyly retired (in swimming shorts) into one of the four jacuzzi pods, which are partitioned from one another for greater privacy. It was quite a memorable, human hotpot-esque jacuzzi experience, with the formidable high-power jets feeling as though they were assaulting you from every direction.KING BAY SUITE CORNEROverlooking the green and orange mushroom-esque expanse of the Royal Hamarikyu Garden as well as the calm waters of Tokyo Bay through floor-to-ceiling windows, the 85sqm King Bay Suite Corner plays it all dignifiedly mature in its Japanese woodiness and motifs, neutral colours and lantern-inspired lighting. The living room features a work station, couch and dining table, while the pantry is equipped with a Nespresso machine, traditional tea-making facilities, a well-stocked minibar with various beverages and snacks as well as a predominantly whisky-centric spirit selection. A seasonal Conrad mascot bear awaits guests on the bed.The white tile-walled bathroom features double vanities with a large backlit mirror, an enclosed bathtub area which plays like something from the set of Saw 4, as well as a separate rainfall shower stall. Amenities are from Shanghai Tang, although complimentary facial products from French cosmetic and high-end treatment brand Omnisens are also available upon request via the Conrad Concierge on the Hilton Honors app. (Speaking of Conrad Concierge, I also ordered a diffuser with lavender essential oils via the app, which facilitated a very good night's sleep.)DININGBreakfast is served at Collage and Cerise, which exist as two distinct concepts within one large space after breakfast hours. The former is a modern fine French dining restaurant whilst the latter is the hotel's all-day casual dining concept, with guests having to pass through the latter to access the former. Whilst Cerise plays it more warm and orange in its vibes, the very brightly lit and Nordic-white Collage is decidedly more elegant in its countenance, being blessed with a wondrously high ceiling and floor-to-ceiling windows.The buffet spread covers the usual continental breakfast suspects, ranging from juices, pastries and Western breakfast to dim sum, congee, cooked snapper slices and fishcakes. There is also an a la carte menu available, with highlights including the Japanese-style Natto and Shiitake Mushroom Omelette with Bonito and Seaweed Sauce and Hokkaido Butter Milk Pancakes with Macadamia Cream.Kazahana is a modern Japanese concept offering specialty kaiseki and teppan menus whilst China Blue serves modern Cantonese cuisine, with both enjoying the same ceiling and window-blessed DNA as Collage and offering breathtaking views of Hamarikyu Garden and Tokyo Bay. Elsewhere, TwentyEight is the hotel's lobby lounge which is equally famed for both their afternoon tea as well as their live music-soundtracked libation experience.EXECUTIVE LOUNGELocated on the 37th floor, the decidedly Japanese-influenced Executive Lounge - think traditional pottery, bonzai plants and Japanese artwork - serves all-day refreshments as well as breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapes and cocktails. Whilst the lounge is bright and cheery in the day, the space is bathed in a warm and cosy glow once night falls, with a spell-binding rock fireplace taking centre stage (a similar one features at the entrance of TwentyEight).The evening canapes and cocktail presentation is very, very good. Instead of rehashing the same generic dishes on a rotational basis like some hotels do, the lounge instead showcases choice items from the hotel's different restaurant concepts, with the China Blue dishes leaving a strong impression. As per Conrad standards, the extensive alcohol selection is commendably reliable, with a spotlight on local whisky, plum wine and gin.I must take this opportunity to compliment the excellent service I experienced. During breakfast at Collage on the second day of my stay, I was presented with a purple origami swan which seemed to be an identifier for Hilton Honors Diamond members, as I then started receiving very personalized attention, with the very warm and well-spoken restaurant manager going as far as to escort me to the elevator whilst I was on my way out.I had seen a Halloween edition Conrad Tokyo mascot bear on Instagram, and during the check-out process at the Executive Lounge, I shared how it would have made an awesome collectable. The manager on duty actually offered to go down to the front desk to retrieve one of their remaining Halloween bears in stock for me as a goodbye gift. (He wasn't Japanese.) It was an excellent showing of the high standard of hospitality and service that I have come to associate with the Conrad brand, and I was very impressed.CONCLUDING THOUGHTSConrad Tokyo is known to be one of the more pricey properties in Tokyo, but this experience clarifies that this is with good reason. The high dining standards, commendable facilities, convenient location and impressive service makes the hotel highly recommended.The original version of this review, complete with pictures, is available at Secret Life of Fatbacks, my personal website.","Singapore, Singapore","secretlifeoffatbacks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",215,5.0

Superd! Conrad Tokyo has once again blown me over. We arrived at 1.30am to the hotel and there was a porter to greet us and deliver our luggage to the room at this odd hour. We are a family of 2 adults with 3 small kids & stayed in the corner suite with 3 beds. That was big enough for the kids to even play some hide/seek in the room :)My kids couldn't get enough of the wonderful breakfast spread, they missed the pancakes and french toast most.Compliments to Ms Aisha at the front desk for checking up on us over the few days we were there and giving recommendation on places to go to with the kids. The kids simply adored her and is asking when we can go back to stay at the hotel again (even without the breakfast).Location wise - it was a short 7mins walk to the JR line where we took the train to Tokyo/Ueno (yamanote line) for our shinkansen transfer to Gala Yuzawa and Karuizawa. We would recommend getting the Tokyo All Wide Pass for 3 days as it covers the Shinkansen ride as well as the local JR lines.From the skybridge linking the hotel to Ginza, we took a 8 mins walk to Donki store and also the Ginza Toy Park. We spent an afternoon shopping / lunch at Ginza before taking a nice stroll back. Around the hotel, there are many food options.

From the time we arrived at 7 am after our flight from Australia and receiving an unexpected early check-in ( the guy to our left did not receive one so it was lucky or random or the fact we had four nights booked) from dealing with the credit card that our taxi driver retained after a mixup at the airport. The taxi driver was fantastic and took our card back at which point the Conrad staff witnessed the cutting of the card and let me know by email - no phone calls and no fuss. Two staff members stood out amongst the wonderful crew- Aisha and a woman in a similar role who helped us a few times but we didn’t catch her name. Aisha hugged my wife after we identified sharing middle eastern backgrounds. Twice she walked with us and waited until we were picked up by a taxi or escorted us in the elevator downstairs and out the door and showed us exactly where to go. We also availed ourselves of the spa showers after we checked out and before we left for the airport for our 10pm flight. The bar is exquisite and the view fantastic . Again the service was phenomenal , just like the staff at the pool and the spa who couldn’t smile enough or get you another towel or literally whatever you seemed to need. Cheap it was not but as long as you understand that ahead of time it was not just acceptable but still seemed to represent value for money in the way they treated you. We have stayed in countless hotels for fun over the years and multiples of that on business but this was right up there with the best client service we have received led by Aisha and her colleagues. We still don’t know why the young guy in reception was able to find a room for us at 7am but we were bloody happy about it. Try and find a good rate somewhere and then sit back and let the service wash over you.","Sydney, Australia","KewParkRanger</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",12,5.0

We also stayed at the Westin Tokyo using our SPG points but was not as impressed.We loved the sleek and modern design of the Conrad lobby, located on the 27th floor. It is a great place to watch the sunrise across the bay. The rooms are equally chic, exuding a sense of quiet luxury. The bathrooms are the state of the art. As Hilton Gold Members, we enjoyed a wonderful Buffet Breakfast with an elaborate spread of both Eastern and Western cuisine. The Truffle Egg Benedict was to die for! The Club Lounge had a spectacular view and some afternoon snacks.The best part of our stay was the warm hospitality extended by the staff.

After a quick trip from Haneda to Shimbashi station it was a short walk to the hotel. As a Hilton Hhonors Diamond member I checked in at the Executive lounge on the 37th floor. It was a busy time to check in so I had to wait around half an hour to check in but was able to have afternoon tea in the lounge. The Execuitve lounge manager ( who was excellent) them came round and completed the checkin process and thanked me for waiting. He offered to upgrade me to a suite the following day for my last 2 nights which I accepted.The intial room was on the 30th floor and over looked the Bay but the views of the garden were blocked on this floor due to the step in the building ( you had a view of the crane used to wash the windows of the lower floors but this is not an issue on the higher floors) The room is luxurious with wonderful furnishings and blinds and shades able to be controlled from the bedside. The bath is huge and the shower was great.I loved the Japanese toilet!The fitness centre and pool were excellent.The next day I asked the bell desk to look after my cases whilst I explored Tokyo then when I came back at 3pm my suite was ready with the cases brought in. The suite is wonderful with a tv over the bath and a separate living room. On the 33rd floor there was great views of the gardens.The Executive lounge was excellent with a great range of breakfast food ( including made to order omellettes ) afternoon tea and evening snacks.The hotel is beside the Carretta Shiodome which had a wonderful Winter illumination show and the Ghibli clock.

From the outset, this was superb. Even though we were not fee paying customers, we were upgraded to a large room with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the park, a welcome gift (including some tasty treats and a rubber duck in the bathroom) and lounge access. We used the lounge for a light dinner, notable here was the friendly service (which was present throughout) especially towards our two small children. Some hotels refuse to let children into the lounge in the evening, we really appreciated that they were made to feel so welcome. This sentiment applied to our whole trip, including check-out when they were offered juice or water (in Hello Kitty shaped water bottles) to take away. These small, classy, gestures, made us feel valued and appreciated. When traveling with a young family, how your children are treated - and the way in which the hotel staff interact with them, as well as you - makes all the difference. Children under three/four cannot use the pool however, even if it's empty. The pool, however, 20+ floors up (the lobby is on floor 26 or so) is beautiful, with a great view over the city. Note that children also cannot access the changing rooms of the opposite gender. So I had to leave my daughter with the pool staff while I got changed, and then had to change her in the toilet. Not ideal, but not the end of the world either. The main thing is we were able to use the pool, and everyone was very helpful to find a work around.There's several options for breakfast. We ate at the main restaurant downstairs. The food choice - from homemade energy bars - to ala carte options (you could pick one, I'd recommend the french toast, the frittata and also the salmon benedict) were superb. Everywhere you turn - both in the restaurant and the hotel as a whole - there's staff on hand to help. No request is too small. Every query is dealt with promptly and in a friendly manner. The quality of english spoken by the staff (in contrast to some hotels in the region, especially outside of the large cities) was exemplary. In short, we wish we could have stayed longer!

Bay views are spectacular and I do recommend upgrading to Club level if is an option or within budget. The club staff is very service oriented and can help navigate the area. Food and drinks, including breakfast are very well done. Only issue for consideration is the gym. A bit small if you are fitness focused.

It is a bit further from all the shopping but is located near a subway and cost about $10 to take a taxi to the more touristy attractions. The subway system was a bit confusing because the business plaza the hotel is located in looks identical at every stop. Plus when we stayed in September there was construction outside that made a wrong exit more of a hassle than it should have been. We stayed here using AmerExpress FHR program and were upgraded to a beautiful spacious suite overlooking the water upon check-in. Every day we had a delicious breakfast plus a property credit. The staff was amazing, friendly, and helpful. the food was spectacular. We enjoyed all the amenities of the hotel from the spa to all the dining options. I don’t have one complaint. all the employees speak superb English, the service is consistent and the location is close to all the action yet peaceful. My favorite thing about the hotel was the cute little bears we received at turn down, which my son loved! We will definitely be back here in a couple years with the kids. This hotel is pretty expensive from the nightly rate to the f&b and spa. If you have a platinum American Express card that definitely helps to save you some money plus you get upgraded (if available) to a much nicer room.

Hotel is very high-end, with service (and prices) as you would expect.Arrived early, but was able to use the gym before room was made available at 12pm. Rooms are very well appointed, walk in shower, roll-top freestanding bath, and very comfortable beds. No desks, but dining table with super comfortable chair - and chaise long running whole length of the floor to ceiling windows.Service is impeccable - I left my tablet in room in last stay, they kept it for me for next time (3 months later) and I didn't even ask for it - was left in my room with a note on the table thanking me for coming back. You get a Conrad collectable teddy with turn-down service, and lots of free water in the room replenished regularly.Gym is by far one of the best in a hotel I have seen - huge range of cardio and weights, going up to 50kg dumbells, and a smith machine - plus swimming pool. Personally not keen on the pool, but good views from floor 29! The changing areas have single-sex sauna, baths and steam rooms (Japanese style) and lots of free amenities.Breakfast is good - choice of a la carte, or wide buffet. Service can occasionally be slow (cappucino seems to take ages) but food is great.The lobby bar is super popular with afternoon teas, etc (especially on a holiday day) and isn't that geared to business travellers - it's also very expensive, as you probably expect, but £9 for a beer is a little steep!

As luck would have it, staff from the Executive Lounge wrote that same day and asked if I needed anything before arrival. I asked about restaurant recommendations, and they sent a seven page guide full of suggestions.

The window seats are a comfortable place to relax and watch Tokyo from above. I didn't have time to use the pool and spa facilities, but they looked wonderful. For breakfast I was encouraged to use the restaurant downstairs as there would be more options available. I took this advice, but returned to the lounge to relax with a cup of tea. The restaurant was very busy, I found the lounge more relaxing and thought that the same range of food was available, including the menu items. So if staying again I would just eat in the lounge.The only discordant note of my stay related to the behaviour of another guest in the lounge. He conducted a very loud and aggressive business call on his mobile phone. This was very disruptive to everyone in the lounge and he should have been directed to make this call elsewhere.

At first I was nervous arriving at this hotel, as it was one of the best hotels in Tokyo and maybe even Japan itself. I stayed at other Japanese hotels but this was next level to be totally honest. The hotel and its amenities are already top notch and the regular rooms are big by themselves. The glass window between the bathroom and the bedroom makes it even bigger. The automated blinds opens up to a beautiful view of the harbor. The view is just amazing at night. The Conrad Bears are a nice touch by the staff to the guests as well as the rubber Conrad ducks. The views from all the restaurants are exceptional as the main lobby level sits on the 28th floor. But what separates hotels apart are the staff. They are the ones that take time to get to know the guests. With that being said, I want to acknowledge the following: Ken (front office) for being welcoming and putting my mind at ease as the hotel was intimidating being so classy when I arrived; Fukiko (Concierge) for going up and above to get me a ticket to a last minute event (truly felt bad for making you work hard but thank you sooo much); Aisha and Nodoka (Front Office) for checking on me to make sure I needed any assistance and to make sure everything is well and lastly to Sarah (Front Office) for making me feel at home here as well as going beyond my expectations. You definitely made my stay here. Also, to the breakfast staff at Cerise. You guys are amazing and always on top of things. Great breakfast period! In conclusion, I cannot think of another way to end my Japan vacation. On a high note. I said it before, life is made of small moments like this.","Kapaau, Hawaii","imua91</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kapaau, Hawaii</strong>",10,5.0

So be prepared to use taxis, Uber, or easily learn how to navigate the underground train system, as the closest stop is a short walk from the hotel.

Omotenashi is a japanese expression for act of providing detailed service in any ways to allow guests to spend a relaxing and memorable time by putting customers first. That is how we felt the day we stepped into the hotel until the day we left. The first feeling you entered the building is Zen. You are greeted with this big indoor tree which perfectly positioned before turning left to the lifts. Flights with Qantas from Sydney arrived at Haneda 5am in the morning. We asked for early checkin but we were told it’s too early and they could only charge us early arrival rate around ¥7000 yen which we agreed. We were told we could have breakfast with this early check in rate. Breakfast in the lounge was great but we found the breakfast on level 28 gave us more variety. Especially with a toddler.Executive lounge afternoon drinks session offers quality bite sized h'ordeuvres. Quality over quantity is the motto here. Great selection alcoholic beverages although I expected they serve Champagne but a good quality French sparkling instead. Umeshu, Sake and Japanese Whiskey are also available.Gym & Swimming Pool: We did not experience this because they have rules only kids over 4 years old are allowed in the pool. I guess this is for hygiene reason.Cons: Extra ¥300 (before tax) for A la carte Japanese Bento breakfast is probably nothing and earn nothing for the hotel. With a premium hotel rate, why would you charge ¥300 and make it inconvenience for guests? But I still recommend you to try it. It’s worth more than your ¥300 yenSpecial thanks to Aisha (CRM) who looked after us and always check everything is ok with us. Thank you also for the eye masks.

The hotel is located a short walk to a JR station which is what we used to get around. It was also conveniently located within walking distance to the Tjukiji fish market so overall we found the location to be excellent (Tokyo is huge, get ready to move around alot!).We had done extensive research before booking and as I am sure many people can see, this hotel receives high reviews. Our expectations were met and I am happy to say that we were not let down in the slightest. My Hilton Gold status combined with emailing the hotel in advance mentioning we were celebrating our 5 year wedding anniversary got us upgraded to the Executive Club level and the specific view I requested (we wanted city view vs the park view). Additionally, they prepared a small welcome/congratulatory gift which is always a nice touch. The lobby bar looked awesome as did the pool, but a busy schedule prevented us from taking advantage of either.Between the friendly front desk agent while checking in, the assistance we got in the club lounge, the concierge (Ms Yuka) who helped us get a fantastic reservation and also went completely out of her way by hand writing a very sweet step by step guide on some sightseeing ideas--we were in awe by the extremely high level of customer service we received at the hotel.

From the moment the Front Desk Manager got me a Twin Executive Bay View room upgrade to dinner at the stylish China Blue, Conrad Tokyo was always going to be impressive.The room on the 36th floor had an expansive view of Tokyo Bay and larger than normal room size in this region.The bed was Conrad comfortable. Large and wonderfully luxurious.The bathroom was huge by any standards and with an abundant of amenities, it really stood out.The bathrobe and pajamas were wonderful additions and really, it was a nice touch.Generally speaking, all the staff were polite and helpful and all seem to go out of their way to do their best and make you feel welcome. I like that. Not many do this well, but the Conrad staff excel in this area.China Blue restaurant was delight and one highlight was when I mentioned how nice the deep fried walnuts coated in honey and sesame seed was, the senior staff in the restaurant brought out another serve of it. He even went out of his way to print out a map of an area in Tokyo where one could procure something similar. Short on giving us the chef’s recipe, this was certainly an appreciated gesture.All good hotels usually do what they do to make your stay comfortable and pleasant but this stay the Conrad Tokyo has certainly been a wonderful experience and I cannot speak highly of all the staff there.This ensures when I am next in Tokyo, the Conrad will be on the top of my list as place to stay.",Sydney,"Mox_Fulder</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",29,5.0

The hotel even stands above the other Conrads I have stayed at in quality and service. It is in a great location, about a half mile to the middle of Ginza.As a diamond member, we had booked an adjoining king and twin city room, and upon check in were pleasantly surprised to see that we had been upgraded to the executive king and executive twin on floor 36. Room 3632 and 3630. The rooms are quite phenomenal, with beautiful bathrooms and quite a bit of space. Of course the views are really great. Check in was really great as well, with the host providing a cute Shinkansen water bottle for my toddler and some really great suggestions for some of the shopping items we wanted to purchase as gifts. She even went above and beyond to make suggestions for some more reasonably priced items than what Mitsukoshi and Matsuya would offer. She even called the store to ensure that they had the items that we were looking for and their hours. My parents enjoyed the snacks provided at the exec lounge while we checked in.Of course they had the cute Conrad bears and rubber ducks that my toddler enjoyed, and provided a very nice welcome amenity and card for my wife, whose birthday we were celebrating.We also took advantage of the breakfast down in the lobby, which was of very high quality. Selection is not as great as the Hilton Tokyo, but quality was good. One point is that I would have wished for a better variety of fruit. We didn't get a chance to eat breakfast in the executive lounge, so I can't comment on that one. Also, one thing that we all noted is that the sheets at this particular Conrad are amazing. Easily the best sheets I've always slept in!We would very much stay here again and look forward to returning.

We normally stay at this property at least once year, and have been doing so for many years. We were so disappointed with this stay, we don’t know how such a perfect Conrad has deteriorated in 2 years and the Omotenashi (Spirit of selfless hospitality) has disappeared. It all started when we walked into the Exec lounge to check in, and we were met with a stiff smile. After the obligatory, corporate greeting, I was offered a paid upgrade to the KING DLX SUITE BAY VIEW which we reluctantly declined. We stayed in this one before and its nice but for our family, no real benefit for the price. Upon declining we were then told that because I have 3 children they wanted to charge me for at least one, even though I had sent the property the total family count at the time of my booking. Clearly, they wanted to salvage more revenue. Eventually some common sense prevailed and additional charges were waved.The whole thing left a sour taste. Breakfast (2/5): The breakfast is probably the most underwhelming buffet, this is not the Conrad it used to be more akin to a cafeteria targeted to large tour groups and not the truly inspiring place it used to be. The menu is now what you would expect from a Standard Hilton or Garden Inn. And I'm not talking about the one in the lounge. I'm talking about the main breakfast on the 28th floor. It seems the Old Super Crew that gleamed Omotenashi from years ago have moved on and now they decided to get people disinterested in what they do bar one or two.Another issue is when we asked to sit near the large windows with the view of the city, they tell you that it is full. The tip is to say you will wait for a free table and Surprise Surprise, in 30 seconds one becomes free. If you were in a large tour group or are wearing a Suit, you seem to be offered a table there. Service was slow and they forgot to order menu dishes. They did make efforts to rectify this mistake but only after 30 minutes upon me enquiring about it. You have to ask for coffee when you are seated, if you’re lucky you’ll get one at the start of your meal. Gone are the days when the first thing they offered was a cup of coffee (or tea) and would come around to offer you a top up with hot coffee. Sloppy for a 5 star hotel. Lounge (1/5): The Lounge happy hour food or lack there of, is the worst we have ever had while traveling in Asia. Service in the lounge was terrible. It seemed that service was better for you if you were from a large tour group if you know what I mean - which is odd because my experience has actually been the opposite in Asia. Both scenarios are wrong, you should treat all of your guests the same, especially in the lounge. By the end of my stay the workers in the lounge just rubbed us the wrong way. The lounge over the years was “Meh” but now it’s just a crap space with sour staff that struggle to smile.Location (5/5)In the heart of Shiodome overlooking the Hamarikyu gardens. The pros of the location is that it is relatively close to Tsukiji, Ginza, Shimbashi and Shiodome Metro and Yurikamome (Monorail). It is walking distance to Ginza (10 minutes) and to Shimbashi station (10 minutes). Rooms (5/5)Great rooms. The standard room size is large which, for a place like Tokyo is quite remarkable. The wooden panelling and extra high ceilings (3m) were nice touches. Bed was very comfortable and I had no complaints about sleep quality. Bathroom was clean and large sized. We also didn't have any smoke issues that some other guests stated they had.Tip: The Corner Bayview King Suite is a narrow shoebox, the standard Bay Suite is cheaper and, has a more functional layout. I unfortunately paid the premium for the Corner Suite but ended up asking to be moved to a standard King Suite (no refunds offered of course).Coffee (0/5)Coffee in the rooms are now crappy Nespresso machines you find in any 3 star Hotel, not the amazing French Press they used to have in each room. You now have 3 choices for crappy Coffee: Room, Exec Lounge or Breakfast. The coffee you used to be the best is Tokyo, now just like any standard hotel like the Hilton or Garden innPrice/Value (1/5)The price is always going to be steep with luxury hotels. My advice is that if you're wanting to stay here and price is an issue, wait for the Hilton sales which offer 50% off twice a year.SummeryThe overall service was a hit and miss. Since Conrad Tokyo has morphed into a Hilton anyway, you might as well stay at the Hilton in Shinjuku. The Conrad is a Luxury hotel with great rooms. However, a lot of work is needed to bring it up to the standard it had for many years. What makes a Conrad a ‘Conrad’ is its intimacy and attention to detail. Conrad Tokyo needs to reflect on what it means to be different from a Hilton, and stay true to the Conrad values. If they were to be true to the Conrad brand and provide its guests with a Conrad experience, they need to reflect on how they treat their guests from the moment a guest walks into the property till the time they check out. The old Conrad Tokyo lived and breathed the Japanese value of ‘Omotenashi’ and “Kizukai”- both of which seem to have been lost. Its hard to get inspired let alone stay inspired when you feel like you in sausage factory churning hundreds of people.We had a below average experience here want the Conrad we remember back. If management has changed please spend time at your sister property in Osaka as it possesses the ‘Omotenashi’ and ‘Kizukai’ in its pure form. Old Super Crew that gleamed Omotenashi Conrad Tokyo have retained some truly amazing people and I felt like I must mention them as they are a 10 out of 5. If I consider to give this property another chance it would be because of these individuals who totally possess Omotenashi and are true brand AmbassadorsNot listed in any particular order:Aisha NamaiNunzio L’OlivaYuka Kuramasu","Singapore, Singapore","OrionOneGlobal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",25,2.0

Even amongst our family members we disagree on this point. What is good: 1. Great Location near Shimbashi Station with sweeping views of Tokyo Harbor and the city. If you bought an unlimited JR pass you need not spend another yen for local transport as Shimbashi connects you to all the major JR lines that takes you all over Tokyo and beyond.2. Great, efficient service. Seems like the whole staff is fluent in English with some having lived in USA. 3. Clean rooms with modern interior designs.What could have been better: Bar was set very high by Palace Hotel Tokyo near Imperial Palace. Possible disclaimer... We stayed at the Palace Hotel 2 years ago shortly after it went through a total renovation. Not sure what the conditions are today.1. Physical...Furniture and wallpaper had some scuff marks and small nicks. Bathroom needs to be updated. The toilet was not new or fully automatic. Still had to manually flush....seems funny to write, but if you have used the most up to date and modern Japanese toilet, you'll know what I mean. The one in the room is like the hotel installed a bidet seat on top of an old toilet instead of upgrading the whole unit.2.

The location is linked underground to two major metro stops, so it is convenient to explore the city. Yes, it is not as close to the touristy areas like Shinjuku, but those are easily reached. The hotel itself is beautiful. It’s the top floors of the Soft Bank building, and the lobby area is very impressive. The Executive lounge offers fantastic views over Tokyo Bay and the gardens.The staff here was excellent. The front desk took an earnest interest in making sure our stay was great, and the concierge track down a lot of options for us for dinner in activities that we asked about. I told the Executive lounge staff that I was interested in sake, and they brought over some sake that they don’t display but have available for guests.We booked just a normal room, but because of our Gold status with Hilton, we were upgraded to an Executive floor room. However, we told the front desk that it was our honeymoon, and they upgraded us to a Junior suite that was not on the Executive floor. That was such an easy trade to make because the suite was absolutely beautiful and huge. Hard to believe that such a large room exists in Tokyo. All the technology was up-to-date.

I know I am a tough critic, but what I experienced from this hotel defied belief. I generally do not believe poor treatment is based on anything but poor service, but my experience at the Conrad Tokyo makes me question whether other factors were at play, race, physical size, nationality, unconscious bias. Who knows, who will ever know. What I do know is that this was one of the worst service experiences I have had at any major luxury hotel. I don't mean those hotels that have a reputation for poor service, but what I mean is those hotels that consistently have high marks. First, the good - the rooms and hotel are magnificent. I was blown away at the nice facilities and the room I was given was in outstanding condition - absolutely no complaints about the room or hotel physical plant whatsoever. My issues were more around service and professionalism:1. As a Diamond, I received no upgrade at all. The hotel was not full and to provide no upgrade was outrageous. 2. To add insult to injury, the front desk agent did say to me, because you are Diamond, we upgraded you to a high floor King City View Room. I had booked the city view room and not sure what she meant by high floor, since all rooms start on the 28 floor and only go up a few more floors. I guess instead of putting me on the 29 floor, they put me up one floor higher. I think it was the fact that she though I, and presumbaly other guest were stupid and would fall for such an insane line - we upgrade you one floor. 3. Suites were available and I should have been upgraded.4. I was ignored completely in the club lounge. No one came to my table, no one offered me a drink, coffee, nothing. No one asked for my room number, no one said hello, goodbye, do you need anything. I was simply ignored. I note that the other more ""local"" guests were fawned over. 5. At check-in the bellman took my luggage, put it on a cart and placed the big cart to the side of me while I checked in. He then left. He never came back and it was only after three calls and 1 hour that I finally got my bags. They were brought to me by the front desk clerk, the generous upgrader one. No explanation, and she could not lift the bags or otherwise place them in the room. I had to do that myself. I assume the bellman may have had other more important guest to assist. 6. When I called to have my room cleaned, I was told it would take several hours and did I just want them to leave fresh towels if I did not want to wait. Not acceptable. 7. A request to change the soap and for other items, such as ice, took hours or were ignored completely. Not acceptable. 8. Room service quality and options are very limited and food quality is not good. Food arrived cold and the order on two occasions was wrong. Not acceptable. 9. When I called for bellman assistance as I had a car waiting to take me to the airport (I used a 50% off Blacklane offer - very good deal), I was told it may take 30 minutes or longer for the bellman to come up. Not acceptable. 10. I told them I could not wait 30 minutes and took the luggage myself. I was meet with an empty front desk, no guest at the desks by at least 8 agents standing doing nothing - and when I got down to the lobby, at least 10 doorman, bellman were standing doing (what appeared to be) nothing. Not acceptable.11. When I told the doorman I had a car waiting, we asked me my name and then said was I sure the care was for me and was that really my name (perhaps a language issue ?? - hey it happens). My assessment of my stay at this hotel = NOT ACCEPTABLE.","Arlington, Virginia","jamessW8845DN</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arlington, Virginia</strong>",145,2.0

I communicated early check in via phone app but that message wasn't read until after I already checked in. Despite of 3 hours early check in, front desk willing accommodated my arrival and they were very friendly. He asked if I needed extension cords or adapters. I couldn't understand why he asked but after I got settled in my room, I learned why he offered extension cords. There were no USB or any electronic outlets by the bed. I found a few outlets by the table but not close enough if you want to use that table to work on your laptop. Perhaps it was only a junior suite room design but it wasn't really a business traveler friendly. Junior suite was very roomy and I really liked their bathroom. Double sinks and plenty of room.Breakfast was just average. Unlike Shinjyuku Hilton, they don't serve champagne at the executive lounge. I decided to eat at the lobby level restaurant as the executive staff said they have more options down there. When we took an elevator to go down, they weren't communicated that we were coming down. Staff knew we were coming right away, she could have notified of our arrival via phone to make it smooth once we got down there. Restaurant did sell champagne for breakfast at 1,500 yen and it was quite good. I highly recommend trying their champagne for breakfast. Food choice.... it wasn't that much. Lacking healthy options. I would have liked more fruits, brown rice and organic cooked vegetables. Pool is a good place to relax. I liked their big window, get to see the downtown Tokyo skylines. Changing room has shower, steam room and individual jacuzzi. Service here was excellent.If you are interested in running, I suggest run towards the imperial palace and do the loop. It was 12-13km including the loop from this hotel, and the imperial palace is a very good place to run.Despite of small minor mishaps, my stay here was comfortable. Front desk staff was very friendly.

Check in - Yukiko from Front Desk was helpful & friendly - She helped store our bags first as our room was not ready. As a Hilton Honors member I did a digital check in & chose my own room. Yukiko gave me another room so when I asked about my chosen room she apologized for not informing me earlier that it was not ready yet but gave another room on higher floor instead. Room - Room was impeccable. Extremely clean & large for Japanese standards. King sized bed was comfortable & additional pillows requested via digital check in were all laid out neatly on bed. We got a city view room so only saw office buildings all around but lucky enough to get a view of Tokyo Skytree albeit far away. My daughter loved the Conrad bears & rubber duck in bath tub - So thoughtful of Conrad to cater to children too Facilities - Pool was great. Divided into 2 sections one for play & other for swim. However it was very crowded on a Sunday so if you are looking to just play in water it is ok but not for serious swimming. There is also a sauna & Jacuzzi inside locker rooms. Plus iced tea & water which was a great touch to small details. Breakfast - On 29th floor at Cerise with city view of office buildings. Good spread of variety but personally I felt Hilton ( Conrad is also under Hilton brand ) is better as it has an egg station ( choose your own kind of eggs with toppings ) & greater cheese variety. Also at Conrad some of the food did not have display tags / signs stating clearly ingredients used which could be dangerous for those with allergies. Service was good overall but I felt puzzled as to why staff took initiative to keep refilling tea cup of a white female foreigner next to me. But they did not come to me to refill my cup & I had to ask them on 2 occasions to do so.

As diamond member I have automatic access to their executive club. We checked on line of Hilton application and received our corner suite and they gave us a room next to same suite. Once we arrived from Kyoto to Tokyo we proceeded to front desk to check in at 1:45 pm. It took front office long time to give me my keys when I asked what’s wrong I was told hotel check in time is 3 pm and our rooms were not available yet but they could give us similar rooms at different floor. We thank them and stated we don’t mind waiting and 3 pm we would like the rooms we checked in to. Then and only then we were told they won’t be able to give Us those rooms. No reason was given ( after basically lying to us and implying we were too early to check in ) we were given same suite on different floor. Don’t get me wrong facilities r great and views are amazing I got our monies worth yet that bas taste of checking process never left . I got written explanation today that they were over sold and had to move me. Offered me 30,000 points in good faith whatever that means. Well their excuse is offensive as lying to us at check in. How would u say that to any client especially to diamond member who already checked in to suite . Was it more important Japanese clientele ? Shame on you Conrad Tokyo.

A group of friends and I (mixed couples and singles, total 10 of us) stayed in the Conrad in May. In general because of our many experiences of Japan, we order some items including Sumo tickets to be delivered to the hotel for our trip. Unfortunately upon arrival, having received all our other parcels, we could not find the tickets. We checked with the front desk and was advised that the envelope was delivered at the same time when our friends' luggage was delivered, without informing anyone. Due this is unfortunate event, it caused a fair amount of grief. To cut the VERY long story short, because we were heading out to Hakone and would only require the tickets upon our return to Tokyo. We left the issue with the hotel to be resolved. Nothing was heard from them until I emailed them about it, when we were about to return to Tokyo. They claimed they did their investigation, but agreed to replace our tickets (thankfully).I guess my issue is, I had to follow up with them about it, and that showed a lack of initiative on resolving the issue to me.On a separate matter, my friends and I shared a twin room with an extra bed. When I entered the room, the extra bed was placed in the middle of the room blocking both the pathways of other beds in the room.The reason why I brought up the 2nd matter, is because it surprised me the sloppiness of the Conrad, what more the Conrad in Japan.The good news is I was informed that the day after we reported the our loss, the front desk changed their process (of many years) to hold the envelopes for the guest and to be handed over during their check in. Kudos to them, and glad guest going forward will gain from our experience.In all, the front desk manager handed the issue resolution to Ms Hasegawa, who I must say worked very hard to resolve the matter.Lastly, I would like to commend the concierge / person who helped us load our MANY luggages, and noticed that I had a cut on my finger and gave me a plaster. That reminded me of how attentive the Japanese can be, and it was a real bonus given the overall experience.","Pulau Ubin, Singapore","G0dL0vesU</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pulau Ubin, Singapore</strong>",64,3.0

Aisha was extremely helpful, gracious, and informative. She answered all of our questions, and is quite the Conrad ambassador. While we were at the lounge, Izume and Naruse continued to lavish us with amazing hospitality with efficient professionalism. They quickly finished the check in process, and within minutes, we had the keys to our room. These ladies exemplify the Conrad brand with everything they do. And they sincerely have a passion for serving others with warm, engaging personalities. Bravo!I’ve never experienced such a unique guest check in experience in all of my world travels. It was so unexpected, refreshing, and impressive. As we entered our room, our luggage was waiting for us along with a very nice personalized welcome note and snack due to our special birthday celebration. The room interior and design is top rate. Hardwood floors, large bathroom with tub and double sinks, waterfall shower, and a wonderful floor to ceiling view of the city.

Be sure to enjoy the lovely high ceiling brunch area on the lobby floor. The brunch buffet is excellent ( Asian, Japanese, American, along with a great a la carte menu ). We decided ask the hotel to courier 50% of our luggage to our final hotel in Japan since we planned to take a few short day trips. Kurumi efficiently helped us complete the paperwork with a smile. Although the surrounding area is mainly office buildings, there is a nice palace garden across the street that charges $3 to enter. Complete with ponds, trees, birds, and walkways.

I’d like to point out Nunzio, who at breakfast every morning would greet us and was really fantastic. The breakfasts at the Conrad are splendid, and are free for Hilton golds (not something available at SPG properties). Also, the hotel has some very expensive restaurants but also some more moderately priced ones as well. Another thing I liked was the pool and fitness center.

The hotel’s decor all around is swanky and chic but also understated and elegant, it has a good location, and also has phenomenal views of hamarikyu gardens and the bay.

We had a corner king bay suite with views over Tokyo Bay and Hamarikyu Gardens out towards Odori Island. We spent two amazing nights here and found ourselves mesmerised watching the city and bay change as the sun went down. Not to mention, this room type is the only one in the hotel where the bathroom has unimpeded views so you can watch the city while you shower or enjoy it from every other room where there are floor to ceiling windows. The buffet breakfast on offer is one of the best I've encountered anywhere in the world, and the in-room dining experience is superb. Staff speak English extremely well and go above and beyond to make sure your stay is nothing short of perfect. Couldn't help but love the extra little touches as well like the Conrad rubber duck in the bath and the Conrad teddy bears on the pillows. We picked up a sale that made the Conrad cheaper than the nearby Hilton hotel. If you don't stay in a luxury hotel often, definitely consider treating yourself here, it's worth it, even if only for one or two nights. In terms of public transport it is extremely convenient with direct access to both the subway and monorail directly outside. It's also only a couple of blocks to the nearest JR station, most of which can be walked in covered walkways, so it is very easy to travel around the city from here.","Lake Macquarie, Australia","stillaslife</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lake Macquarie, Australia</strong>",12,5.0

The facilities and services are generally good or ""standard"". And the location is also good: the ward of Minato which is close to the heart of Tokyo and Japan.

Overall I would say that this is probably one of the best hotels I've stayed at, not just in Tokyo. I don't have anything bad to say at all, and overall it was a very pleasant stay.The rooms are fantastic, lots of space and attention to detail. I stayed in a king room twin beds. It wasn't the best view however I usually don't go for views. If that's your thing I'm sure you can request a room overlooking Tokyo harbour (?).Small things count for a lot at the Conrad for example:- there is an aroma diffuser throughout the hotel, so it's always smelling very nice;- ceilings are very high, especially in the lobby so there's this grand feel about the hotel;- shuttle bus service to and from the airport takes the hassle out of travelling to Narita Airport (cost is ~¥3,100);- newspapers can be delivered to your room in the morning;- all the staff are very well trained and serve you well and speak good English;The best part of the hotel for me however is the Sento / spa / gym /pool on level 29. This is free for guests so if you think about how much you'd have to pay outside for this kind of service then you actually save about USD$20 per day.The only thing is for all this you're going to have to pay up for it.

She is a huge fan of all things Snoopy and I had contacted the concierge prior to our visit about arranging something special. When we arrived we were upgraded to an executive level room and shortly after the concierge (whose name I regretfully can’t remember) delivered a cake to the room, along with a plush Snoopy, Snoopy handtowel and Snoopy card. She was very happy and surprised about this and I applaud the Conrad team for coming through in a big way. Really wish I could remember the woman’s name so I could single her out for praise. The room was very nice, though I have to say the bed was harder than I would’ve liked, though I slept fairly well. The electric blinds are a nice touch and the city view from our 36th floor room was pretty cool. The bathroom was well appointed with a particular highlight being the rain head shower nozzle. We also enjoyed the evening drinks in the executive lounge, especially considering the price of a drink in Tokyo. As a Hilton gold member I was able to get free breakfast in the hotel restaurant and the breakfast buffet was among the best I’ve had at any hotel. Huge variety of food to be found, all very high quality. You can also get a cooked to order breakfast entree with the buffet, with the eggs Benedict being a particular highlight for me, the eggs in Japan are awesome with bright orange yolks. The hotel location isn’t bad as it sits right above the Shiodome station of the Toei subway Odeo line and is about a 10-15 minute walk from the Shimbashi station (all an underground walk) which gets you access to just about everywhere else as it has Tokyo metro and JR lines etc. I will definitely return here again when we find ourselves back in Japan.

The only niggle which was a little problematic and would’ve knocked a star off my review was that the hotel was very fully booked for the golden week, and meant that the room given to us had to be combined with my moms into the Royal Suite. Which also meant a twin bed rather than king. The room itself however was spectacular. The views, tub, bathroom and Lounge access were fantastic. And service was typically Japanese and very much 5star plus. The location was delightful and breakfast every morning a delight. The lounge breakfast was more than adequate but you should try the breakfast at the restaurant which was abundant but high quality. The one dinner we had downstairs at the restaurant was really yummy as well. If a tad expensive. The location also makes it exceptionally convenient for you to eat around the area or even travel for yummy delights.All told this is a high recommend for me. Thanks for making the stay great.

We arrived at 10 am to the hotel, after disembarking from a cruise with 20 or so fellow passengers.The check in process was disorganised and we had to ask several times for our luggage to be dispatched from the bus to the foyer on the ground floor. No porters to be seen anywhere. It was actually chaotic and no one was clear in their communication. Guests were not informed that reception was on Floor 28.Someone asked to go to the toilet on the ground floor and was told that because there was a convention on in the adjoining conference room, the toilets were out of bounds and to get the lift to floor 28, where the toilets were located.Not great because it was a bit urgent and no one knew where anything was on Floor 28.Eventually we were instructed to go to reception on the 28th floor, where we proceeded to wait at least 20 plus minutes before being served. Check in to the room was at 3:00 pm and there was no way it would be any sooner. We were told to come back,in a fairly abrupt manner, after 3:00 pm. There were 2 concierge, so the whole process was underwhelming. Guests were organising tours, while others were checking out and checking in. Hopeless actually.We sat in the foyer for a while and then headed out to lunch. Friends of ours who were waiting in chairs near the window were told to move, as the seats were reserved. There was no reserved sign on the table and they felt quite offended. Yes the introduction to the Conrad left little to be desired and there were many disgruntled travellers.When we eventually got to the room we were pleasantly surprised by its size and splendid view. The servicing of the room is outstanding with changes of towels and room refresh twice a day and nightshirts left on the bed each not get.Breakfast offered a varied menu but unfortunately many of the hot items such as bacon and sausages were cold. Warm plates should be provided because putting tepid food on cold plates is not great.Overall we enjoyed our stay and checking out was seem less. I just wish that our introduction to this splendid hotel had been more welcoming. Maybe a refreshing towel and a cup of green tea.Or more organisation on our arrival with the luggage. While I did not expect to check in at that hour a little more warmth and efficiency would have been appreciated by all the weary travellers.","Brisbane, Australia","ktay158</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",29,4.0

I mean if you want a grilled cheese sandwich delivered to your room it's going to be over USD $30 without anything to drink. If you want to eat in one of their restaurants, forget it. We didn't so I can't review their food. The prices were sky high - up to more than $200 pp for Prix fix menu options. It's unapproachable unless you're beyond wealthy.

At check in, Ido at the Reception desk, found us a the exact room I wanted even tho it was only for 2 nights out of the 3. Nothing beats the check in experience at this hotel.

As well you are given direction cards in a Japanese for you to give to a taxi for the trip back. A special note is Koji Notake, one of Tokyo's best concierges, who can handle virtually any need promptly. Our airport car was very late and in less than 5 minutes he arranged a replacement. Many of our friends use OpenTable however there is nothing better than Koji and his team making your reservation. You are treated and welcomed as a local and the restaurants know they want a great report back to the hotel.

The view of Tokyo bay from our King Suite was amazing. We were able to enact The Lost in Translation jet lag in style; even though the sleeplessness was torture at least we had a to-die-for view and opulence to ease the pain. The English speaking staff were helpful and polite. The location on top of Shiodome station and 8-minute walk from Shimbashi station was good once we had orientated ourselves properly. Only slight annoyance came from their refusal to supply us with complimentary English Breakfast teabags even though other types of tea (Oolong and green) were supplied and restocked daily. Breakfast was extortionate so we went to the cafes in the Tokyo Shiodome building next door instead.

Offering at evening hour at the lounge was mediocre, I have never expected they served ice cold tempura as one of dish. Tempura should be served with hot and crisp otherwise not tasty.

If people interested in having Japanese food, should go down to the 1st floor and get into the same building, several Japanese style restaurants are located, you can have real Japanese dinner around 10 usd.

I’ve been to Tokyo many times on business, but never on a holiday, with the time to investigate the many exciting destinations that you read and hear about. We stayed at the Conrad Hotel Tokyo which is 5 Stars in every manner. From the design of the Hotel, the beautiful guest rooms, to the gracious team of Hotel Staff Members who welcomed us and made us feel at home. The Hotel location was strategic and convenient for us to start our tours each day. The breakfast buffet was an important start to each morning, serving both western and eastern style foods. The service was quick, so that we could begin our daily adventures. The staff were very friendly, offering insights on the city and sites to see. Namai, is a waitress in the restaurant, and became a welcomed sight each morning, making us feel like we were old friends who stopped by. The Treasure Hunt: 32 years ago, I received a photo from a college friend, showing him standing on a staircase while pointing to a crack in an ancient stone wall. There was a note with the photo, indicating that a vile containing a note and other special items had been hidden at this location, and he provided instructions on how to find it. The treasure site was located 2 1/2 hours by train from Tokyo. For years, I intended to retrieve the vile, but amazingly, 32 years of “life” had quickly passed in the process. To help us with the treasure hunt, I went to the Hotel Concierge and met with the very kind and resourceful Ms. Matsuzaka, telling her about the hidden treasure, and that we needed a Guide who could join our team. The world has changed over the last three decades, so I felt that it would be important for us to have someone who could explain (in Japanese) to any Security Guards or Police, that I was not a security threat.  Ms. Matsuzaka found us the perfect Guide to lead our adventure, with Mr. Yu Kono, Co-Founder of JapanWonderTravel.com. On the morning of the adventure, Mr. Kono met us in the lobby of the Conrad Hotel, filled with enthusiasm for our unusual adventure. He had already researched the best method for us to reach our destination, along with how to safely locate and retrieve the treasure.  I will discuss the treasure hunt in my review of JapanWonderTravel.com, but will leave you with the knowledge that the “Hidden Treasure” mission was a great success. After our adventure, when we returned to the Conrad Hotel, we were surprised to find in our room, that Ms. Matsuzaka had created a beautiful “Congratulations” card with a graphic of the historic site where the treasure had been buried, along with two beautifully wrapped gifts. Her kindness and resourcefulness, led to us finding the hidden treasure, and also led to one of our greatest discoveries......the treasured friendships that can be created through generosity and kindness.

It is a sleek and modern hotel with a great staff and equally amazing food. During our stay here, my girlfriend had an assignment due and this is truly a hotel that caters to businesspeople. It is brightly lit and has a lot of spaces to do work, such as a lounge with a fabulous fireplace and a breakfast area, which was designed in a traditional Japanese fashion. We upgraded our room to receive access to the latter and were not disappointed. In this penthouse lounge we were treated to the most fantastic view of the city and the bay as we munched on a fabulous breakfast and sipped tea. It was great! Our room was large and clean with a glass partition between it and the bathroom. If you wish for more privacy, you can let down wooden blinds electronically which was quite nice. You can also connect to speakers over bluetooth and play music in the room which we very much enjoyed.

We had no problem with that because we wanted to be out out the hustle and bustle. Service is amazing, Food is amazing, especially breakfast which was included for us. They have 5 different specialty juices, omelette bar, fresh fruits, and all foods for every country. When I say their food is AMAZING, it is really an understatement. What I loved is that they have food for every culture. It is not only Japanese food or western cuisine. They do an amazing job with every possible aspect. The only reason I rate this hotel at a 4 instead of 5 is because of value.

They were running a 50% off flash sale, so we were able to get a significant discount on the room which made the rate workable for us. The Conrad Tokyo may have been our favorite hotel during our 3 week trip through Japan. The service began before we even arrived, as we had questions about shipping our bags from Tokyo to Osaka. The hotel provided rates for next day service and same day service, plus arranged all the paperwork. BTW, shipping a suitcase same day to Osaka only cost about 3500 yen, which is a great rate and allowed us to do sightseeing in Tokyo during the day and not have to drag our bags to Tokyo station or get it to our Osaka hotel. We used the airport limousine from Haneda airport and it dropped us right at the entrance to the hotel. As Diamond members, we were whisked to the executive lounge to complete our check-in. We had booked a Bay View King and were hoping for a Diamond upgrade to a suite. Unfortunately the next level suite wasn't available and they weren't willing to upgrade to a premium suite. That aside, our stay was terrific. The hotel isn't very big, so it's easy to get around and doesn't feel overcrowded. The restaurant breakfast was awesome with a great spread, plus several yummy a-la-carte dishes (the pancakes and whipped cream were amazing). The executive lounge was fine, though the evening food options were a little underwhelming.The room itself was very comfortable. I had some of my best nights of sleep in a long time in that bed! The bathroom was spacious, and the sitting area by the window offered a great spot to look over the bay. As for location, it was excellent. The Shiodome metro stop is right below the hotel, and the Shimbashi metro stop and train station are a 10 minute walk through the underground passage. This allowed us to get almost anywhere in Tokyo with relative ease. There are also lots of dining options as you walk towards Shimbashi station.Bottom line: this hotel is truly a 5-star experience. Comfort, food, service and location - it checks all the boxes. It's not cheap, but if you catch one of the flash sales, it's absolutely worth it!","Fort Collins, Colorado","Krivokrasov</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Collins, Colorado</strong>",118,5.0

The hotel is very close to Shiodome station (pratically right on top of it), and not too far from Shimbashi station. Walking to Ginza takes about 15~ minutes.

In the morning I went to order breakfast via room service when I was informed to would be better value to have the buffet! Which was a great choice. I arrived with ten mins to go.

As they were packing up she offer to get me fruit and more things from the epic buffet (I was so happy to see cheese again!)

It is a beautiful hotel design-wise and the colours and textures resemble, at times, an expensive peice of Japanese lacquerware. The flowers are stunning and we enjoyed the quiet ambience. It is very close to the train and bus stations and Ginza is a 15 minute walk.We stayed in an Executive Room on the 36th Floor which was worth the extra due to the size and view and of course the lounge upstairs which serves complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails. The food at the lounge was of a high quality. The housekeeping is exceptional in that details count in a hotel of this quality: the room is spotless, your clothes are folded, any items you leave out of your toiletry bag are lined up perfectly, and there are the little Conrad Bears on your turndown at night. Bravo to the staff in this area.Where I think the hotel failed a little is in the concierge and lounge service information area. Whether it's the language or not, we had some miscommunications and simple tasks taking an inordinately long time. (Check-in took a long time).If I am staying at a hotel of this standard I always ultilise the conciege BEFORE coming to the city to book or recommend restaurants etc. Whilst this was done very well, the instructions and time estimates were way off, causing us almost to miss a booking at a restaurant because we were over 30 minutes late due miss-estimating time needed. Getting taxis and getting help with luggage though was efficient and easy and after some backwards and forwards the hotel managed to get us some tickets to the sumo which we appreciated!All in all, I would stay again and look forward to doing so.","Sydney, Australia","imaginelle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",131,4.0

We do at least one overseas holiday with our 2 young children every year. We don’t travel for work so it’s nice to see how hotels treat guests who aren’t business guests or gold tier members.The service at the Conrad Tokyo was exceptional. Throughout our 12 day stay the staff generally went above and beyond to assist with any query or concern we had.Jonas, the customer service relations manager was devoted to ensuring that every one of needs was met and took initiative to get things done. We could not fault his genuine manner and personalised service. He should be rewarded by management as he is a true asset to the Conrad.Rise from concierge was very helpful. The rest of the concierge desk were hit and miss but most tried to be helpful. We found that concierge were better when we sent emails than in person. Room:We stayed in a bay view suite on level 36. The room was large for Tokyo standards but small by international standards. It was still big enough for our little ones to play. We had 2 double beds and a toddler bed set up in the bedroom. The beds were comfortable and our toddler loved splashing in the big bath in the shower room while watching cartoons (there’s a tv in the shower room). The bay view was lovely and we left the curtains open in the living room so we could enjoy the lights. The blockout blind was brilliant at making the bedroom dark. The walk through robe would ideally have more storage space but I still managed to have the 4 of us unpacked.We emailed concierge before we arrived and requested amenities for our toddler and baby. The hotel was able to provide all of these which shows that they value families.Lounge:Harita, Amica and Miyoko from the exectuve lounge were fantastic hostesses. They remembered our orders, kids names, preferences for food etc. They also spoke wonderful English so we often asked them for recommendations rather than concierge.I would highly recommend paying for lounge access and kids are allowed in the club (although we did try to keep them quiet as a courtesy to other club users).Food:Buffet breakfast was much the same as every other buffet breakfast. The service downstairs for buffet breakfast was non existent so we chose to eat breakfast at the club which had a smaller selection but all the main items.The restaurants were good (especially the Japanese restaurant) except for the Chinese restaurant downstairs. Service at the Chinese restaurant was terrible and quite frankly the worst we received throughout our stay. The staff even pretended not to speak any English (we were told by other staff that they do speak English, just not to us I guess). Avoid that place.We ordered a lot of room service. It is expensive but you are paying for the convenience.Location:The hotel is set in the corporate area. Easy access to trains, monorail etc.We love walking which seems to shock people in Asia. We take our double stroller and walk 4-5 hours or more during the day. It’s the best way to explore a city and we love being outdoors.We walked from the hotel to Ginza (easy walk), Tokyo Tower, Imperial Palace, Tokyo station (to catch a bullet train), Roppongi Hills, Shibuya (took almost 2 hours one way) and lots of other places in between. Our tip:Email the concierge before you arrive with any requirements. Introduce yourself to staff and look for Jonas if you can. Have access to the lounge and enjoy Tokyo which is a beautiful city with lovely people.","Rose Bay, Australia","Indulgent_travel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rose Bay, Australia</strong>",33,5.0

We arrived extremely exhausted on New Years day and our roms were not assigned the way we had requested which made us feel unhappy. However this is where the service shone. The front office manager, Mr. Yohei Asano , excelled in making us feel happy by trying his best to give us one of the best rooms the next day. We just couldn't have asked for anything more as it was the Royal Suite on the 37th floor with stunning views of the bay and gardens. The location of this place is perfect and you can walk to Tsukiji market and to Ginza as well. It is attached to the Shiodome station or else you can walk a few meters to the Shimbashi station where there are much more train connections available. We had access to the executive lounge which might be one of the best lounges in the Hilton group all over the world. There was a good hot breakfast served with a cook present to make eggs the way you like or you could partake in the extensive breakfast down in the main restaurant. It was always packed to capacity but the staff were extremely efficient in finding a table for you. I just cannot praise enough for all he staff, whether it was the lounge or the restaurant or the front desk or housekeeping. I just wish I knew all their names to thank them individually.

For our first room, we were upgraded to a King Corner Suite on the bay side. It was the nicest hotel room I had ever been in, until we got to the Conrad in Osaka. The second room was a more standardly-equipped Twin Executive room on the city side. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the fish market, where you should go for 5:30AM sushi. It’s also very close to higher end shops and stuff in Ginza. Overall, the experience at the Conrad Tokyo was an easy 5/5.Room: Both rooms were very well appointed and clean. Both also appeared to have the second-to-last generation of the room controls (curtains, etc) and Toto toilet. The King Corner Suite was massive, with a large entryway with half bathroom, seating area, separate bedroom, and very large main bathroom. It also had nice views of the bay overlooked the Hamarikyu Gardens.The Twin Executive room was of a more standard size, with a small entryway, bathroom, two twin beds and small seating area. The one annoying thing about this room is the window between the bathroom and bedroom. The whole wall is a window, with electronically controlled blinds in it. While this is fine for bathroom privacy, it bled quite a bit of light into the bedroom even with the blinds fully closed.Amenities: Aside from the room, the only amenity we used in the hotel was the executive lounge, where we went for happy hour a few times and breakfast once. The spread at both meal times was above any beyond any of the other hotels where we stayed. You could also go get breakfast in one of the restaurants on the main check-in level, but we did not choose to do so.Staff: The staff was among the friendliest we encountered in Japan. We were met by the bellhop staff at the base of the hotel, who escorted us to the executive lounge on the top floor for check-in. After check-in, we were taken to our room where they explained all the controls and features (very necessary since several things are hidden in cabinets). The executive lounge staff was always smiling and welcoming, and they were constantly walking around to see if anyone needed another drink.","Cincinnati, Ohio","rfrisch</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cincinnati, Ohio</strong>",49,5.0

There is a minimal lobby and waiting area on the ground floor; elevators take you up to the main lobby and from there, a separate bank of elevators serves the rooms. The views are spectacular.The room was very large and filled with natural light, thanks to the full wall of windows. A window seat further enables you to enjoy the view. The bed was comfortable, with good bedside tables and lighting on each side. There was a glass wall between the bedroom and the bathroom, but a shade provided adequate light control to avoid disturbing your partner if one uses the bathroom during the night. The bathroom had a dual vanity, plenty of counter space and good lighting.The breakfast buffet was delicious, with a good variety. We didn't try any of the other restaurants, but the lobby bar is lovely. Service was top-notch. Downstairs is an attached mall with a Starbucks, convenience store, and various other shops and restaurants. It also connects with the Shiodome train station, making it convenient to get around.

Firstly, I made a booking for 5 nights over Christmas - back in April. I have always wanted to have a large room with a beautiful view in Tokyo and told the hotel so when I made my 80 sqm corner suite booking, 8 months prior to arrival. The room we got must have had one of the worst views in the hotel, and how is it a corner suite when it doesn't have a corner view? Conrad, please don't describe rooms as 'corner' when your corner is occupied with the maid/cleaning stations. (A serious error made by the architect.) We got one of the lowest possible floor rooms and the view was straight into some very close and large office buildings, I could see some city if I leaned very close to one of the windows but that was it. So disappointed with that. If the Conrad had emailed me as I made the booking and made me aware of this I would have changed rooms to the other side or hotels. There is no excuse for this, your customer wished for something and you failed to deliver as well as failed to inform that the customer could've had what she wanted if she had made a change in the booking. We talked to reception but they said they couldn't do anything as the hotel was full. (Which proved to be true according to their website.) The room itself was fine, a little tired, furniture a little dirty - and the couch that looked comfortable on the photos was very hard and uncomfortable so sit on, it should never have been chosen. The bed was comfortable the shower pressure outstanding, blinds were truly making the room extremely dark, very nice. I got sick during my stay and stayed in the room more than what I assume is normal. I was extremely bothered with noise at what I believe was someone one floor above us. There was walking on high heels all day every day and it was extremely loud. I just don't understand how that is possible as I thought the room above us and below us were similar, and the traffic was so high like it was an office.There's a carpet in the room but the noise was horrible as if someone walked on bare wood or tiles with heels. Very strange. Probably not the hotels fault, but annoying nevertheless and marring the experience as I wasn't able to rest much. Furthermore, the hotel made a mistake on 4 out of 6 room service orders. Food that was asked left out (tomatoe due to allergy,) was inside a sandwich, we asked for a glutenfree meal that indeed was made with regular bread. Had I not had the glutenfree bread the day before and knew it would look different - I would have eaten it and gotten very sick. That is abysmal. Allergics be aware at the Conrad, I heard the order being repeated for glutenfree sans tomatoes and it happened twice. 4 out of 6 orders wrong for an overpriced 30$ sandwich is laughable. Also, the lobby area as well as the reception area is sprayed with disgusting perfume/chemical from a large diffuser that sprays into the air with an interval of minutes. The lobby stinks of perfume due to this and for us with perfume and scent allergies and I imagine for those with asthma - this is pure terror. I got really sick from it and had to walk fast through the common areas. Hotels everywhere do this and it's hard to get away from. Management at the Conrad: please consider stopping polluting our breathing air, it's horrible for us with allergies. (And probably not healthy for those with no current allergies as exposure to oils and perfumes are potential allergens everyone can react to at any time, I'd refuse to work in this environment if it were me.) The pool looked nice with a beautiful view, but felt stuffy and warm and very chlorinated so I couldn't swim there. The service was adequate, the level of English not what I expected, it was pretty rudimentary at best. They are sweet and service minded though. The executive lounge was nice but nothing exceptional there either. Food was okay but repetetive and very carb based. The concierge helped us with a package to be delivered to our room prior to our arrival, and helped us change a booking for a show, so our experience with the concierge was good. I agree with another reviewer, that the Shinjoku area would be a better for a first time visit to Tokyo as the Shiodome area is a bit boring and a bit of a walk to the fish market as well as Ginza, and you won't get a taste of the real Tokyo. All in all I'm disappointed in my stay at the Conrad and we will not be back.","Boulder, Colorado","Travelbird0505</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boulder, Colorado</strong>",180,2.0

The take away from this hotel is that while its rooms are great, their lack of attention to detail and mistakes really do detract from a 5 star experience. Bottom line is Its worth staying if you can get it on sale, but its not really worth the rack rate of $500+ price point at current. Hopefully this review will give an unbiased opinion to travellers. Location (3/5)In the heart of Shiodome overlooking the Hamarikyu gardens. I've stayed at the adjacent Royal Park Hotel (which is about half the price) and so I am familiar with the location. The pros of the location is that it is relatively close to Tsukiji and in some respects Ginza. It is walking distance to Ginza (10 minutes) and to Shimbashi station (10 minutes) but after staying in Shiodome twice - I wouldn't stay in the location again - and wouldn't recommend it especially for first time travellers to Tokyo. I would recommend instead a hotel next to a main subway/train line or in Ginza / Roppongi / Shinjuku itself. Front desk / Check in (2/5)Staff failed to direct us to executive level for check in - one staff member had no idea it was even a possibility to check in on executive level. Waited about 15-20 minutes for check in at the front counter. With a time like that, its slow for any hotel. Rooms (4.5/5)Great rooms. The siize i believe was 48sqm for their standard rooms which for a place like Tokyo is quite remarkable. The wooden panelling and extra high ceilings (3m) were nice touches. Bed was very comfortable and I had no complaints about sleep quality. Bathroom was clean and large sized. We also didn't have any smoke issues that some other guests stated they had. If I had only one comment about improvement, it would be the dated television (2012 model? in 2017). Lounge (4/5) Very good lounge. Service was generally good. Seating was well spaced apart and great decor. The lounge only very rarely felt crowded. The open concept with two sides having views of both the city and the bay was an excellent design choice. The food and spread were generally reasonable. The wine choices perhaps could be expanded and rotated a bit more.Breakfast (3/5)The spread is quite wide, but the quality of the food itself is par for the course. Its what you would expect in any 4 or 5 star hotel. The food and spread was slightly better in Cerise (the restaurant) than in the lounge as expected. Cerise allows you to select a further dish of the day. My main gripe is that Cerise is too busy, period. Feels more like a school cafeteria than a luxury hotel in the morning. Service was slow and they forgot both our dish of the day orders on the first day. They did make efforts to rectify this mistake but only after 30 minutes. Sloppy for a 5 star hotel. We didn't go back to Cerise after this, not because of the mistake but because it was too crowded. I generally wouldn't recommend breakfast at the hotel.. You're better off trying the local cuisine outside the hotel. Facilities (na)The hotel has gym, pool and spa faciltiies. We didn't try any of them so I can't comment. Concierge and service (3/5)Below par for the course - especially for a 5 star hotel. I compare this to our Concierge at Hotel Granvia in Kyoto (which is a far cheaper hotel). Compared to Hotel Granvia, the Conrad was (1) Slower to respond (2) Straight up refused to even try to make certain bookings saying it was too hard (3) Failed to go to the extra mile - which hotel Granvia did - when considering it was our honeymoon. The overall service was also hit and miss. They did put a fresh ice bucket in our room every night which was nice. However one night, we were busy during turn down service and they failed to come back later to try again (never had this happen before at a hotel).If your concierge is make or break (you want to book very difficult restaurants) - I would go elsewhere (peninsula / mandarin oriental / park hyatt).Price/Value (3/5)The price is always going to be steep with luxury hotels. My advice is that if you're wanting to stay here and price is an issue, wait for the hilton sales which offer 50% off twice a year. Overall (3/5)In summary the Conrad is a Luxury hotel with great rooms and lounge. However a lot is needed to bring it up to the standard one expects of a 5 star hotel. Japan is renowned for Omotenashi (Spirit of selfless hospitality). The Conrad needs to reflect on what that means to them and whether it needs to make changes. I had an average experience here for our honeymoon and I don't think we'll back in a rush.","Sydney, Australia","GastronomicHunter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",77,3.0

We made the mistake of not checking the prices when using their laundry service so our full load of laundry ended up being the most expensive laundry load we've ever done, but I must say, they way they washed, folded, and packed our clothes really showed the amount of detail and pride the staff here put into their craft.

Its obvious from when you first arrive and it does not disappoint at any stage, both in terms of the quality of what you get (food, drinks, massage etc.) and the service received from staff. 2) The quality of service is Japan is typically very high, but some can find it a bit 'cold' as it can be a bit reserved. This is not the case at the Conrad, every member of staff was friendly, courteous, professional and very knowledgeable. There were three kids in our party (8-12) and every member of staff went out of their way to make each of them feel that they were the most important people in the room.3) The location of the hotel - is very close to the fish market - literally a 10 minute walk away4) Accessibility to and from the hotel - there is an airport limousine bus that services several hotels in this area including the Conrad, which is always a big tick for me. Just be wary that if you are arriving or leaving Narita late in the evening then the buses do not run very late, so you might need to organise alternative transport. Tokyo train station is a 10 minute taxi ride away, so that might be an alternative option (especially if you are arriving/leaving via Shinkansen). I can't talk about Haneda as we flew out of Narita. The hotel lobbly in not on the main road, but there were always a couple of taxis sitting by the entrance up so getting one was never a problem5) the view... If you are going to stay here then get a room with a view over the bay. it is spectacular, day or night. The rooms with this stunning view all end in odd numbers and it is worth waiting for. The view from the lobby bar is the same, so if you are in doubt then have a look out the window here. You will not be disappointed. The views on the other side of the hotel are fine, but they are the typical views you get from most hotels in Tokyo... of the city itself.6) The facilities - it has a lovely 25m pool that is simply superb. The lounge is great as well - with limited breakfast in the morning (6.30-10 am), afternoon tea (3-5pm... with ice-cream and fruit fondue). When we stayed (Jan 2017) the executive lounge was being renovated, so we had to use a temporary one just behind reception - but even that was better than most other lounges I have used.Would I stay there again? Yes, in a heartbeat. In fact, it is going to be very difficult to stay anywhere else on our next stay in Tokyo.

Therefore we brought home a spray bottle of the hotel’s signature scent so we could enjoy the smell and memories at home. When we wanted to purchase another bottle online we couldn’t since they are made exclusively for the Conrad Tokyo hotel and only sold there.I remembered receiving an email from the hotel manager so I wrote to him to inquire about the possibility of purchasing a couple more bottles. However after some research and several emails back and forth, he informed me that unfortunately the shipping companies - UPS or Fedexp - do not ship liquids. I was disappointed, had given up and was saying goodbye to the last few drops of the spray scent left. Then the hotel manager mentioned he was traveling to NY in November and offered to bring me a couple of bottles. We live in Florida but by coincidence were going to be in NY during the same dates so it worked out perfectly. He was so kind that he even dropped the bottles off at the hotel we were staying. I want to thank and commend the Conrad Tokyo hotel manager for going completely out of his way to help me with my request, and for providing me with the best customer service experience ever.

As with most hotels in Japan, the facilities were beyond clean. Service on the other hand is the same you would get in all Hilton properties - corporate and impersonal - not what you expect from a luxury property. We had booked one of the top corner suites - this was a bit of a misnomer - with corner you expect views on two sides? For Conrad that mean literally a suite in the corner - why is it more expensive unless you are trying to mislead buyers. Next as a multi-year Diamond member staying for more than 7 days in a suite I was expecting an upgrade. I had even contacted the property in advance - but got the corporate response. When we got to the hotel, they did not even direct us to the executive check-in desk and told us that no upgrades were available for our whole stay, only for a few days. The suite was just plain and badly maintained - heavily scratched furniture and scratches on walls. The overall welcome was a small plate of amuse bouche - compare this to the Peninsula properties where you get turndown goodies and fresh fruits in your room everyday for an equivalent suite. I did note this online and I must say the hotel responded and upgraded us to a beautiful suite 3 days into our stay, But to be honest the hotel lacked a luxurious personal touch. The lobby was crowded most of the time and the executive lounge felt like an upgraded Hilton - breakfast was the same everyday and tea time service was sub-par in terms of selection and quality.The spa is nice, as is the gym and pool. A note however that if you are going to run a spa in an international hotel you may want to hire english speaking front desk staff.

I did not go out at all during my short two days stay however the stunning view of the city and the bridge plus the extraordinary food in the restaurants are enough Japanese experience I needed. The hotel is convenient to get to. As soon as you exit baggage pick up, you can go straight ahead and buy the limonsine bus ticket which will be just in front of you which takes you to Conrad, and you don't have to worry about carrying your bags around for public transport! It is cheap as well 3100 yen! worth it for an hour and a half journey! The hotel has perfect modern decor. I booked a twin room and it looked better than the picture! You even get a night gown too so no need to bring one! And a cute little teddy bear which is a nice touch :) Conrad service is on point, I ordered my Japanese breakfast to come 6.30 and it comes right on time! I spent most of my time in the fitness centre. It is actually a health club rather than its own private gym, so you get many locals running on treadmill at 7 in the morning already. The facilities were good as well as the swimming pool. However one thing I would complain about is the exercise classes. As I am someone who regularly practice pilates, I found that the pilates class was not pilates, more like stretching, no core work or anything. So I made a complaint to the spa receptionist. He was in denial and said that maybe I am too advanced, I said no! any old person could practice pilates! The instructor gave me a half an hour free of pilates. It was good. However when I got on the phone to book the afternoon class hoping that he had learnt a lesson and it got better, nope. The receptionist argued with me and said that the classes will not change style just because of me! I said to him that what they advertised there as having pilates and making guests pay for the class was not pilates and continuing to do so, is false advertisement! He made the same old excuses, that some are old blah blah blah. I simply could not stand this and this is so unprofessional. This is like advertising that there is a muay thai class but actually its a sumo class. It is a complete joke as this receptionist had no idea what he was talking about. Obviously not seen the class or have an interest of what pilates is, and have no trust in what I said. So if you are going to Conrad hoping to do some hardcore pilates workout in your stay too, DONT! Apparently according to Conrad pilates the abs or spine don't exist lol! I heard that Mandarin oriental even got the reformer, so go there. Anyway the restaurants are excellent. I had sushi that I never tried before in my life in the sushi bar and watched them made it. I ordered set menu and in the evening I ordered fine dining type of menu with many courses. Everything came out so beautifully with perfection! The gym is twenty four hours so I had a two hours session before I left. Don't forget to insert your keycard in the lift if you are going to that floor! The receptionist booked me the bus back in advance which picks me up straight from the hotel, again no carrying the bags around the train! Overall this hotel was an amazing experience and I hope they will make changes required in the future to make it even better!","London, United Kingdom","yingatha</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",1,4.0

You would not get anything near as good as this for double the money in London or other major European/world destinations. And for a bit more money, we also got an absolutely stunning bay view, which was a joy to go to bed with and to wake up to.- well-maintained public areas. Nice pool. Nice bar. - convenient location. Not hurt by the fact that it's an easy walk to the Tsukiji market.The bad:- service that is polite on the surface but not genuine: I've been told that that is the ""Japanese way"". I guess it's still much more preferable than the out and out bad/hostile service that you get from most other hotels/destinations. To be fair, the service at the Conrad was much better than the much more high profile (and $$$) Park Hyatt,- the concierge: the only restaurant recommendation that we sought from the concierge seriously ruined our trip and our impression of the hotel (oh hello Tenichi!). It would always leave a sour (or greasy?!) taste in our mouths when we suspect that the hotel is taking commissions for such ""recommendations"".In conclusion, will we return to the Conrad Tokyo? I'm certain that we will, especially when it represents such (relatively) good value for money.

The trip was very last minute, basically for next day travel. I tried booking for this hotel through my travel agent but he said it's fully booked. I then went on amex travel website and found that this hotel was still available therefore I made my booking there. It was so great to be able to stay at this hotel. 1. Location. This hotel is near the shiodome station. We took the skyliner from Narita airport to ueno and took the taxi there. Taxi fare was around ¥2500 as I remember. Although the hotel there isn't a whole lot of shops nearby, we found it to be quite convenient to walk to Ginza. Probably around 10-15 mins walk. The walk is easy and straightforward. For those who are into architecture, the famous nakagin capsule tower is just nearby. The station for odaiba is next door which makes a trip to the odaiba very easy. 2. The room was booked through amex fine hotel and resort program but they were only able to honor some amenities. Together with the Hilton gold status, all 3 of us received daily buffet breakfast, and usd120 to be used at the hotel. Unfortunately no upgrade was available. We got a room that is very spacious by Tokyo standard. Ceiling to floor window with city view, spacious bathroom. The room was very clean and well appointed. 3. Service was excellent. From check in, concierge to restaurant staff, all were outstanding. Japan is famous for their high standard in the service industry but Conrad does it even better. Most staff speak good English. 4. Breakfast was very enjoyable. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the breakfast spread has a great variety of food with the option to order from their menu. Restaurant staff was very efficient in general but one morning there seemed to be someone more important in the breakfast room so the staff took priority in taking care of that customer first. The hierarchy was obviously observed.I would very much love to return to this hotel when I visit Tokyo again, however will also keep an open mind to try out other top hotels. Highly recommended!

If we return I would pay for this upgrade, it's well worth it if you enjoy a happy hour and lounge area each evening (5-7pm) where the staff are on hand to help you find fun tours and adventures during your stay. It's a lovely way to wind down at the end of the day, there are lots of comfy seats overlooking either the bay side or city side, and the snack buffet is enough to hold you over until dinner. Given that a vodka drink will cost you 2,800 yen in the bar (a little under $28) this happy hour can really help! They serve a nice sparkling wine, and other options, including full liquor. The rooms are very nice, reminding me of the top hotels in Las Vegas with their modern touches -- great lighting and blind controls, for example. And of course, a very fancy and fun toilet. We had great night sleeps - very quiet, and full black out curtains. Leaving the hotel can be a bit overwhelming since it's on top of the stations so there are underground walk ways, street-level walkways and then over-street walkways (similar to the upper levels in Vegas or the High Line in NYC). There are lots of restaurants hidden away in these 3 levels, you will be amazed they're all there. Not that we found anything to recommend, we found more the kind that the local workers were eating at during lunch or after work, or the fancier ones connected to hotels. The hotel itself offers 3 options (quite pricy). TIP: There is an international ATM outside the main door across the short walkway into the neighboring hotel lobby (turn left past the Italian restaurant - clearly marked).","Oakland, California","GPToak</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland, California</strong>",89,5.0

Room without a view is not worth booking. There are other similar hotel closeby which sit in similar rank with more affordable price which do not offer outstanding view. I think the staffs in Conrad are very courteus, but we had experienced better service in other 5-star hotels. Maybe because it was very crowded during our stay? Or simply because we did not spend enough time in the room. . . Overall, we enjoyed the view so much.And they provide real small plants in the corner of the room which adds personal touch. Tips: if you are still taking JR trains instead of taxi, go to Shimbasashi station using the bridge (not on its main road down the bridge).

From the proactive offer of an English-language newspaper of my choice to the game-changing turndown service, the Conrad was never a disappointment.On the other side, the property can be a bit stingy with upgrades. In any event, the executive lounge may not be worth it for you. While service there is absolutely fantastic (I was consistently addressed by name despite never giving my room number), the lounge tends to get crowded and the canapes are nothing special. If you have the chance to take a bay view instead, take it.

A necessity in the heat of a Tokyo summer. The usual well stocked mini bar had a number of extras too. The bathroom was well appointed and had a lovely free standing bath as well as an excellent shower. Toiletries were also in abundance. Food in the restaurants was also of a very high standard. We enjoyed dinner in the traditional Japanese restaurant on our first night trying out Teppanyaki dishes cooked by a master chef - who turned out to be a real show man. A great introduction to a much loved form of cooking in our family. The view from the restaurant was to die for. The buffet at breakfast was also excellent with an eye watering selection of dishes from around the world. Although we ran out of time to try it, afternoon tea in the lobby looked incredibly tempting. Everything the hotel provides or offers shows great attention to detail and is well thought through. Time is given to aesthetics as well as to comfort and practicalities. The hotel spa offers a true haven from the heat and fabulous madness that is Tokyo.

There is the peaceful Hamarikyu Gardens just next to the hotel that allows for a great morning stroll. There are not many restaurants or convenience shops near the hotel, but there are plenty in Ginza.

You should try Intercontinental ANA Tokyo or Palace Hotel for best experience. Pros: Service quality, employees attention with guests, good room size, and sanitation.Cons: A lack of creativity, automatic coffee machine, poor coffee drink quality, a lack of real barista, a lack of chef at executive lounge, mediocre meals, average meals quality, hassles with directions to hotel, and confusion with the hotel directions. Check in procedure was slow and delayed. Breakfast was okay. Spa facility was okay NOT exceptional. Wifi access was sometimes poor. Executive lounge does not have any computer with printer. Swimming pool contains chlorine and smells stinky awful by water chemical substances.This hotel Conrad Tokyo is a little bit bored and lacked spirit. Conrad Tokyo does not give you much exciting or uniqueness to make your experience memorable. Check in procedure was okay and they would not give you mini water bottles or a champagne drink at your arrival time. We paid $ 1100 for one night and we got not much from this stay.

Spent two nights there on a recent tour of Asia and wish I had spent more time here. I've been fortunate to stay at some pretty great hotels in my travels and not too many were as good as this Conrad. While we were checking in we realized what a place this was - fabulous view and truly amazing restrooms in the lobby. Great start. We were upgraded to a suite with a bay view which was amazing; lots of space and a great view. The bathroom was terrific - the shower (and crazy Japanese toilet) was as good as it gets. The club lounge was among the best I've ever experienced. Complementary adult beverages and snacks at night, including ice cream sundaes, which I'm not sure I've ever had in a hotel lounge before. Service was over the top too, constantly refilling champagne glasses and whatnot. The outdoor pool was also very nice. Breakfast was great in the lounge, and on our second day they allowed us to have complimentary room service because we had an early plane to catch. The ladies in the lounge took our order the night before and the food was delivered as requested, on time and as ordered. This is the kind of thing that makes you really appreciate staying at a truly great hotel. Well done, Conrad! I am trying to think of a negative, and the only thing I can think of is that the location leaves a little to be desired. We had a ridiculous time trying to get to the hotel from the Hamarikyu gardens, which are right next door but separated by roadways. But the Conrad is very close to two subway stations that are kind of easy to navigate and also walking distance from Ginza. All in all, the Conrad Tokyo is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. If you have some status with Hilton you'll be very well taken care of, and even if you don't I'm sure you'll be quite happy here. I can't wait to return.

However most of the Japanese hotels were requiring us to get two rooms since we were three people. The Conrad was willing to put in a roll away bed so it turned out to be less expensive to stay there (though not inexpensive). We also wanted to be within walking distance to go the fish market. You have to line up around 2:30 am to see the tuna auction. Prior to arrival the concierges were very helpful and responsive, helping us with transportation questions and especially dinner reservations. Our daughter has a food allergy and we needed help making sure places were safe for her to eat. Check-in and check-out were efficient. Our room had a gorgeous view of the river/harbor. The room was spacious with two twin beds (but really full size). Since my husband and I shared a bed, our daughter had the other twin so we really didn't need the roll away. There was a nice window seat to enjoy the view. The bathroom was huge with a separate space for the toilet and shower and all the toiletries one could need. After walking 20K+ steps a day sight-seeing it was great to come back to the room and relax in the bath with a book and a beer.

The view of Tokyo Bay was just breathtaking. The hotel is very stylish and aesthetically stunning--from the common areas to the room, and the personalized service was wonderful. We spent 3 nights there, and we felt as though we were coming home each time we were greeted by the staff (I wish my doormen at home were half as nice as the employees at Conrad Tokyo!).The Executive Lounge offered a spectacular city view, and I loved having breakfast there. They also had interesting small, fun things to nibble on throughout the day (loved their sparkling white grape jello!), and it was one of the most well-appointed and most comfortable Executive Lounges I have ever visited anywhere. Although it is a bit on the smaller side, it never really got close to full--so perhaps their Lounge access is properly controlled to match the size of the Lounge.On my third day, I was feeling slightly under the weather and I guess I mentioned it to the staff at the entrance...and breakfast staff offered to put together some ""get well"" breakfast items and bring them to my room. That was so nice of them, although I wasn't feeling THAT bad and ended up enjoying the regular Lounge breakfast.The location of the hotel is a little tricky, though, if you want to fully utilize Tokyo's amazingly reliable and efficient public transportation system. But it is central enough that, if you don't mind minor traffic jams, a quick cab ride can take you to places like Ginza and Odaiba for under 2,000 Yen/US$18.Overall, we had such a wonderful stay there, and I highly recommend this hotel.

The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the bustling main drag of Ginza, and it's conveniently located right above a subway station. Complimentary breakfast was elaborate and delicious. The Japanese restaurant's wagyu beef was phenomenal. Nice gym, very cool pool with city views, nice spa facilities. Extremely friendly and courteous service.

Breakfast was very comprehensive, there is an omelette chef each morning, and plenty of variety of foods, both western and eastern of which to partake. The view from the executive lounge is absolutely stunning as well. I was back early enough one evening to enjoy some small bites, sandwiches, and cheeses for the late afternoon snack.

Even after I turned the fan on high, they were quite loud!I had a great window seat by which to enjoy the views of the city. Everything is automatic as far as blinds and curtains, so it was nice to be able to really open everything up and have a light airy room.

In the evenings the lounge off the lobby was a good place for an evening libation, listening to live music, and enjoying the panoramic view of the sparkling harbor . We had dinner at the Japanese and Chinese restaurants, both had excellent quality, yet the portion size was that of appetizers, for example in the Chinese restaurant I had the prawns enter which came with 3 modest sized prawns . The Salmon I had at the Japanese restaurant was similarly small, and the prices were high... we ended ordering a second entree at the Japanese restaurant while left their Chinese restaurant hungry. Their breakfast was decent with selections of western, Japanese, and Chinese options. Their service was sketchy, and the staff wasn't prepared Sunday morning for the number of guests, so the overflow was seated in the Japanese restaurant across the hall.

The airport limousine bus arrives at the hotel, which sealed the deal for me, as I am not fond of lugging 1.5 luggages through Tokyo's complicated subway.It took around 10 minutes to walk to Tsukiji. In addition, although one could walk along the overhead path connectors to the Shimbashi station (just follow the Yurikamome train track), it was just as convenient to take the new Yurikamome line to Shiodome station, one stop away from Shimbashi. Conrad was literally a stone's throw away from Shiodome. I did not attempt to walk to Ginza - It costs only Yen650-750 to take a cab to the area. Once I figured out the train system, it was just as easy getting to Yurakucho and Tokyo stations, where my food and shopping targets were.The interior designer of Conrad Tokyo did a fabulous job. The room seemed slightly larger than the Shangri-La, which could be a plus point if one needs the space for an extra bed.In my room on the 30F, there was an unpleasant urine odour emanating from within the toilet. Informed Housekeeping the next day who did a good job of clearing 90% of it. My sensitive nose could still detect its presence. Perhaps it was related to the cistern or plumbing. I would really be interested to know if my hunch was correct. In my recent stay at the Westin Nusa Dua, the same issue occured with a basic-level Toto bidet type cistern.On the bidet topic (trademark of Japan!), the one in Conrad wasn't as fancy as the ones in the other hotels that I stayed previously. The flushing system was not automated, nor were there motion sensors to lift the seat cover. While this is not a big deal, it does somehow feel like a gap between the other hotels which aimed to provide luxurious rooms and great service (and the Conrad Tokyo is already so close...)Booked a facial at the Mizuki spa which cost around Yen23,500. I feel asleep under the skilful hands of Ran (the therapist). The scalp and neck massage was so..ooo good. The hot mask compress literally melted all the traveller's fatigue away. I really wanted to try the Mizuki Spirit package but unfortunately the place was fully booked on a Sunday morning.Chanced upon an opportunity to top up my room rate for a day's breakfast (which was great as I wanted to eat at Sushi Daiwa on my other morning). There were buffet and ala carte option. Since I am not a big fan of mass cooking, the ala carte optionality was awesome. Ordered the eggs benedict, which was just as delicious as some of the other hotels I have been. (Hint: A sprinkle of caviar would have created the perfect balance!) Loved the juicy melons and lychees from the buffet section. The flat white and cappucino were both disappointing - bitter aftertaste and untidy foam presentation. I must say I have not yet found a good cup of coffee in Japan after all these years.Would I stay at the Conrad again? Absolutely! The limo bus would be the differentiator but do note the limited timetable.","Singapore, Singapore","Rokugatsu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",83,5.0

I deliberated between a few hotels prior to making the booking as the location of a hotel is of major importance to us. As it turned out, we made the best decision as it was really nice to explore the busy part of the city and then in the evening retire to the quiet sanctuary of the hotel.We arrived very early and due to our Diamond Status we only had to wait an hour before we were given access to our bay view suite on the 34th floor. In the meantime, we were given access to the lounge and the staff were very helpful.The concierge in the lounge helped us enormously in working out our transport routes across Tokyo. It was so easy and their maps along with printed directions helped considerably. We travel extensively and I have never had such service where different coloured posted notes were marked onto where we were going, along with extra notes highlighted in the same color.. The attention to detail by Yohei was so appreciated. Thank you to Suko, Naomi and Jacquie who pointed out some potential food allergies. She remembered for the remainder of our trip and always made sure that I knew what food was on offer. I knew I could count on her and she is a lovely asset to the brand.The suite itself was very spacious with lovely views. The bed was very comfortable and the room was soundproof. There were no noises of trains, other people or anything else to wake us.......even in the morning. The only thing to mention is that the shower area grout needs a redo and the carpet needs to be spot cleaned in places. I am very fussy but this is why we choose the brand.Breakfast was fantastic and we have had many Conrad breakfasts. We chose to have breakfast in the main restaurant and Deepak and Hamada made breakfast a wonderful experience. The food off the menu came very quickly and was very hot. Fresh juices, fruit and many healthy options were also on offer.On our final day we had a late checkout due to a late flight and the Lounge Manager gave us the time to explain many things about Japan which really enlightened us more on the culture.In summary, it was a wonderful trip and we would highly recommend this hotel for a fantastic trip in Tokyo.","Sydney, Australia","Vanessa M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",37,5.0

It all started when when we walked in on the first floor and no one greeted us or offered to take our bags. And yes there was someone working behind the desk. So we just went up to the 28th floor on our own. Now they're supposed to greet you and take your luggage. So much for service. When we arrived to check in on the 28th floor we are asked ""checking out?"". Umm no I'm checking in. Now it was a little after 1 pm and we are immediately told that our room wasn't ready and that we can leave our bags and come back after 3pm. Now I know that this is the policy but I've never actually encountered this ever before. Almost always if this situation occurs, we are told ""if you want to wait we can probably have a room available in about 30 minutes"". And that's for hotels where we have no status. my wife and I both have elite status at Hilton. And the person checking us in knows this because he told us our room is being upgraded because of our status. We have access to the executive lounge so why wasn't it offered for us to be able to relax in the lounge while our room was being made ready. I know they do this because on a different day while we were in the lounge, we over heard them telling someone they could just stay here while their room is prepared. The whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth. Breakfast: The breakfast is probably the most underwhelming buffet I have ever experienced anywhere. And I'm not talking about the one in the lounge. I'm talking about the main breakfast on the 28th floor. In fact we have been to holiday inns that have better breakfasts. By far the worst and to top it off the food was always cold. Lounge: The Lounge happy hour food or lack there of is the worst we have ever had while traveling in Asia. It is on par to what you will find in the U.S. Also, one evening they had chicken skewers that were raw. When we pointed this out, nothing was done. They just left the chicken there. Service in lounge was terrible. It seemed that service was better for you if you were Asian. Which is odd because my experience has actually been the opposite in Asia. Both scenarios are wrong, you should treat all of your guests the same especially in the lounge. By the end of my stay the workers in the lounge just rubbed me the wrong way. Every time you walked by an employee, they would say thank you for choosing Conrad. It seems that this is their idea of service. It wasn't all bad. I just love the smell when you walk into any Conrad. And this one lived up to that. The bathroom in the room was nice and big. The mirror in the bathroom is awesome. And the room itself is a good size. So was this the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. No. But this was the worst 5 Star Hotel experience I've ever had. I wouldn't stay here again, and would advise others to look elsewhere if you want a true 5 Star hotel in Tokyo .

My favorite is definitely the Conrad Hotel. It's right above the train lines and a heartbeat away from Ginza which is the best area for restaurants and of course shopping. I am a club member so the lounge access is wonderful. With the room we get nice breakfast from eggs to cheeses to fresh salads and happy hour where they serve free flowing drinks and canapes. The rooms are really spacious with amazing views and the lighting in the bathroom is unbelievable. Perfect if you seek for flawless makeover. The gym is really nice and they offer daily yoga/pilates (at a charge). The lounge is super cool with a fire place, musicians on the weekend. Great hotel if you are on holidays or on a business trip.","Hong Kong, China","lifecoach2017</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",25,4.0

We stayed 4 nights in a city view room. We spent more a night than we normally do for a 5*. We might not get back to Tokyo so we didn't want to be disappointed. We chose (for the same money) city view with breakfast over bay view with no breakfast. As it turned out for us it was the best choice as we never once sat in our room and looked out the window. Breakfast was a choice of room service or lounge, or breakfast buffet in the restaurant. We chose the restaurant - I highly recommend the restaurant. If you have club access you can enjoy the bay view while enjoying an evening glass of wine or beer with snacks. We had a martini in the bar area - amazing view. Maybe one of the best dirty vodka martinis I have ever had - and one of the most expensive :) Rooms were clean, modern and comfortable. A short walk to the fish market and to Ginza shopping area. Great restaurants. The transit system is also right there which we took to go see the Imperial Palace. I tried to ask if we could walk but I could not get anyone to give me directions. It was so short of a train ride I am sure I could have walked. The JR GREEN LINE goes in a round loop and once we figured it out it seemed easy. We made a mistake and were trying to figure out their local line. We went to Shinjuku for the day using the JR line. We booked a bullet train and tour in Kyoto. We were picked up at the Conrad hotel lobby. There are beautiful gardens right outside the Conrad. Small fee to enter. We discovered there were boat tours leaving from inside this area, which we didn't do as we didn't have the time. If you are looking for more nighttime party atmosphere this is not the area to stay. Loved our stay and would recommend this hotel and area.","London, Canada","travelqueen2010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, Canada</strong>",10,4.0

As Honors elite level member, 5 nights stay are priced as 4 nights. The original booking was for City View Twin, however Conrad was kind enough to upgrade us to a Bay View King. We were given complimentary breakfast due to our status, at the Cherise restaurant every day of our stay.Room:Large, I believe the website cites 48 square meter. Conrad's website has quite informative section describing the floor plan. The room overlooks Hamarikyu Garden, Tokyo Bay, Odaiba area and the Rainbow bridge. We could see part of Tsukiji fish market from our room as well. There is a couch/day bed along the floor to ceiling window which is enough for an adult to sleep in a pinch. Bathroom is large with stand alone tub, separate commode and shower room. Breakfast:Extensive selection. The only minus on our mind, we were not allowed to have breakfast sent up to our room. As Hyatt Diamond member, we could have breakfast in the room. Hilton will do well to match that.Staff:Concierge and hotel staff are all excellent. The one slight minus is not every front desk staff have good command of English, but it is in no way dampen our enthusiasm to stay here again. One shout out to Petrlik (I hope I spelled her name correctly). She is one of Cherise restaurant staff. She is very patient with us, explaining about how the restaurant prepped the place (we asked), and pointed to us some local delicacies that are in the menu. Location:Conrad is in the Shiodome area, walking distance from Yamanote train station which is a minor hub in Tokyo transport network. The walk can be done in about 5 minutes, through overpass on underground passage. It is also across from Hamarikyu garden, which is the only city park in Tokyo with water feature that take intake from Tokyo bay, so there are ebbs and flows on the ponds in the park. Waling distance from Tsukiji market, and Ginza (although for some Ginza - about 1 km away, maybe a bit of a stretch. Tips:The adjacent office building has several convenience stores (Family Mart), the closest one opens until 10pm. Another one further down on underground passage open 24 hours. They come in handy when you need snacks, beverages, etc if you do not want to spend money on room service. There is also a Starbucks that open early (7am), 1 floor down from the closest Family Mart.Still in the same building as the Family Mart and Starbucks, except on the 2nd floor restaurant area, each restaurant has take out offers every day for various kinds of bento boxes (Japanese, Korean, Chinese or Thai style) for 600-700y per box, and they are all very good and very filling.","Auburn, Washington","Robert M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auburn, Washington</strong>",58,4.0

Good location, great amenities, great views in rooms, good service. Lobby smells great. However, hallways smelled smoky. We were on a non smoking floor. Soon after check in, we smelled smoke in our room as well as in the hallway. We called front desk who said that they will notify ""housekeeping"" to address this. (Although we were surprised they sent the housekeeper, likely the small Asian woman cleaning nearby to take care of the people smoking in their rooms rather than security). Still, this was addressed right away. By the next morning, the smoking started again (seemed like from another room). Since we were only there for a night and checking out in the am, we didn't make a fuss. It's a shame that smoke reeks in the hallway because this is truly a beautifully designed and appointed hotel. Restaurants are super expensive. For a family of four with 2 kids eating at the casual dining place ordering only burgers, it can almost $200 US dollars. I don't mind paying more for great food, but the burgers were good,but not that good to cost between 3800 and 7000 yen per burger. Breakfast was ok to good but typical for higher end Asian hotel. Service again was little slow because they were busy but again very friendly service. (They forgot my wife's order... we finally asked them if we can go ahead and pick up the now cold pancake ourselves that she had previously ordered, still sitting near the buffet counter 10 minutes after we noticed it was made). Rooms and views were truly great and perfect for our last night in Japan before heading out to the airport. Everyone was tired and really didn't want to do much but enjoy the views from our rooms.

It was so big by Japanese standards. The staff provided a honeymoon cake as well as a cute bear souvenir for our honeymoon! However I felt the lobby staff were not particularly helpful. Upon check in, I was told that reservations (made direct via the hotel website online) forgot to charge me an admin fee. I paid upfront and I was surprised they were asking me to sign off on the extra charge! The concierge had to get approval from the manager but I felt if it was truely a five star hotel, then managements mistake should not be passed/penalised back to the guest. Also we are talking about five dollars max so I'm not sure why they would bother pestering me for this!!!Both my husband and I were ill from my hakone trip upon check in but I didn't feel like management went above n beyond to do anything. (Not that I expected it but other hotels have went the extra mile to make guests feel special). The hotel location itself is in a business location: u have to walk ten - fifteen minutes underground to access the subway. It's got food and shiodome shops outside though which is convenient, Do check out the Christmas lights outside shiodome around this time as well. It's amazing!

Location is about above Shiodome station, but I think we almost always walk to Shimbashi station (a 10-15mins walk) as it is more conveniently connected to the Tokyo railway and metro network. From the ground floor entrance to the high ceiling lobby, the interior is somewhat modern minimalist style with nice subtle color palette and materials. We waited in the lobby for quite sometime before checked in around 3pm. The room were truly spacious by Tokyo standard. My friend's son were ecstatic when he enter their room and said the room is so cool and fantastic. The Conrad rubber duck on the bathroom, and a couple of little bear on the second night on the bed, were little nice touches. Staffs were just polite and unobtrusive. Too bad we packed a lot of activity outside so there's little time to enjoy the hotel. There's notice letter on the first day about power blackout for a few hours at midnight because of some maintenance, which occurred on our last night. I have to wait for around 20 mins on the ground floor because of the elevator was also off for around half an hour when I came back at that night and then I had to packed things in darkness and the room temperature is a bit chilly as the air con is also off. They did provide a flashlight though. 4 stars for the rating for this stay because of this, but I think this is extremely unlikely to happen, maybe less than once a year.

I am a light sleeper and am always worried about noise, especially at a hotel/city I've never visited before.The building is built exceptionally well and the windows are really soundproof (it also helps that the rooms are on floors 30-37) - I could see cars going by yet couldn't hear any noise at all despite straining to try to do so.

It occupies the upper (28-37) floors of an office building, with a separate entrance and elevators for access to the hotel. The views of the harbor, which is just behind the hotel (separated by a quiet park) from the large windows on these upper floors can be quite impressive. Because of type of roads and the ongoing construction, though, the area around the hotel can be somewhat challenging to navigate. However, the building is connected to an underground pedestrian complex that permits guests to walk to the adjacent Shiodome subway station and (with a little further walk) the Shimbashi JR rail station. Because of the challenge of navigating through the maze of the train station and underground mall, as well as the extensive crowds at Shimbashi station, those traveling from Narita to Tokyo Station via the Narita Express will probably want to take a taxi for the first trip to the hotel. The hotel rooms are well maintained and are equipped with all the modern amenities that would be expected (even the top Toro toilets with the heated seats ....). The rooms can be modest in size, though, and can be a bit tight with a roll away bed (charge of 75 yen per night) added. The restaurants are, not unexpectedly since they are part of an upscale hotel, quite expensive. The food was of excellent quality, but for very limited quantities. There are a number of restaurants connected to the hotel through the underground pedestrian area that will be likely be of interest to the cost-conscious. For those able to use the executive lounge, the breakfast served there was solid, with a chef on hand to prepare omelets. Fresh pineapples, grapefruit and cantaloupes were served, together with pastries, meats, potatoes, drinks, etc. The offerings did not seem to change each day.The service at the restaurants and the hotel generally was excellent.

Ignore obvious discontent? Then the Conrad Tokyo is the place for you.On the last night of a twelve-day trip, I had a twenty-hour layover in Tokyo. I originally had booked a room at the Hilton Tokyo Narita Airport, with the intent on going into the city until the trains nearly stopped running, then heading back out for a long night's sleep. After some thought, I decided to splurge and book instead at the Conrad Tokyo. I figured that the combination of Hilton Gold status and booking through the American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts* would ensure a great stay.I was wrong.The Conrad Tokyo is located in the Shiodome/Shimbashi station complex, near Ginza, on the 28th through 37th floors of its building. Getting into and out of the hotel is relatively easy. Once one enters the hotel, one must proceed to the 28th floor to check in. I checked in around 18:30 or 19:00. The problems began then. During the process, I was greeted and welcomed as a Hilton Gold and Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts member. Fine. The agent informed me of the benefits, but mentioned I would not be receiving an upgrade because ""the hotel was sold out tonight.""Note the choice of words. The whole hotel. The problem is that her statement was categorically—and perhaps more importantly, verifiably—false. At 21:15 that dinner that night at Kazahana, the Conrad Tokyo's Japanese restaurant, I checked availability on a whim. The hotel was anything but sold out. Not only were base-level rooms available (cut off on the photograph because I didn't bother taking a photo of them), but multiple tiers of suites were available.Any statement that ""the hotel"" was ""sold out"" were categorically false. The desk agent either (1) lied to me, or (2) was uninformed, either because she failed to inform herself of crucial information or because management failed to disseminate that information to employees who need it.Conrad Tokyo rooms are divided into two categories: regular and suites, with both categories having executive-floor flavors. Each room can either be city- or bay-facing, with bay facing rooms being more expensive, but apparently physically no different than their city-facing siblings.I detail this because twin suites were available throughout the day. This is the category into which basically every other Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts participant would upgrade my room (including even the SLS Beverly Hills, which was otherwise a fetid disaster). Failure to upgrade when an upgrade was available is a huge, huge strike against the hotel. The staff's lies or incompetence in the matter compounds the problem.As mentioned above, the hotel is split amongst ten floors. There are supposedly three or four elevators, but for a short hotel with what should be plenty of lifts, it takes a painfully long time to make it anywhere in the hotel. Plan accordingly.The decor—both rooms and common areas—are Japanese minimalist. They're nice enough, but let's be honest: One can find equally nice decor in hotels with competent staff.I dined at Kazahana, partaking in one of their kaiseki menus. It was fine, but the problem was that it was only fine. It is disappointing when a meal onboard ANA's first class is better than a meal at a Japanese restaurant specializing in kaiseki menus. Sure, the ANA seat would cost far more than the meal had I not booked with miles, but under no circumstances should a pre-prepared and reheated kaiseki meal outclass a ¥14,000 kaiseki meal.Finally, check-out was disappointing.

The rooms are surprising large for Tokyo with electric black out blinds which is incredible for jet lag. All well appointed and beautifully designed. The bed linen is always high quality in the Conrad which we definitely appreciate and aids a restful night.We also appreciated that when we rang reception or anywhere in the hotel they knew to speak English as we didn't speak Japanese.Food and DrinkThe room service menu was the best we have experienced as it drew from the numerous restaurants available in the hotel. The bento was so beautiful and delicious.The bar which has great views across Tokyo was also a treat and we enjoyed champagne cocktails and the wine selection was impressive. Highly recommend even if you aren't staying in the hotel.We ate in the collage restaurant which is French cuisine.

Although my husband had been to Japan on two previous business trips, this was my first visit. Tokyo can be overwhelming even for someone who has called Los Angeles and Mexico City home, so the Conrad was a good choice for the convenient location, but even more for the high quality of service. Conrad and Japan in general have very high standards for accommodations and services. As expected, the room was clean, aesthetically pleasing, and all services were prompt, polite, and performed to the highest standard. Amenities were excellent, including the pool and dressing room with tradional bath jacuzzi. However, the best part of our stay was our access to the concierge lounge. Aside from the two sections with different views and the ample and tasty selections at breakfast, tea and evening reception, the concierge lounge staff, Amica, Asumi Hata, Sekizawa, Hirota, and Yohei, made our stay memorable. In particlar, we would like to thank Amica and Asumi Hata for sharing a more personal side of Tokyo and the special Cherry Blossom time. We like to do things on our own using our Japan Rail pass and subway card and we were especially grateful for the clear directions, good advice and recommendations for different places to experience Cherry Blossoms and other aspects of the local culture.

The biggest gem of all is the Concerige, Mr. Chapay Deepak.My husband checked-in the Hotel before me and when I was trying to locate him, Mr. Deepak chased after me and told me that he would go and let my husband know of my arrival. He told me I should just go up to my room and relaxed and he would take care of everything. I was totally impressed and wondered how he could identify my husband. Well, he did his job and my husband came to the room shortly. What can I say? This Concierge worked magic.Throughout our stay, we always ran into him and it almost made me feel like he never went home. He always greeted us with the biggest smile and inquired our well beings every time.The concierge lounge was very small and crowded at the time but I read that Conrad has since expanded the lounge, so problem solved.Conrad also has the cutest bears they left on your bed during the turndown service.I like the Hotel and will return when in the area.

It had a nice living area, large walk in dressing, guest toilet, a large modern bathroom and a twin bedded master bedroom. The beds were a bit hard but this is often the case in Japan and in general we always had a good night’s rest. As usual with Conrad, they offer a number of different bathroom products and a good choice of amenities. Housekeeping was prompt and consistent, even when the hotel was booked solid for the Sakura season.For Japanese standards the suite is rather large and had a nice view of the surrounding city. Most prefer the bay view rooms but we really enjoyed this side. The bay is visible from the Bar “28” also from the executive lounge.The hotel’s location has been a point of discussion in earlier reviews but we did not find it badly located. Yes, there are more centrally located hotels and if you only a very short time, these might be worth considering. The Shiodome subway station is directly beneath the hotel and the Shimbashi station is roughly 10-15 min away depending on the platform you need. From here, you can basically get anywhere. The fish market, Hama-detached garden and Roppingi/Tokyo Tower are within walking distance.Check in took quite long and they were very strict with the 15.00h check in (we were told to wait until 3 PM around 2.55  ). The staff was courteous and professional. The concierge knowledgeable and they arranged some ticket for us, even before we arrived. The bar Twenty Eight is truly a gem with a wonderful setting and interior. It seems to be very popular for the afternoon tea. Cocktails are expensive but perfectly made and also here the service level is high.The executive lounge on the 37th floor was nicely decorated and offered a selection of breakfast (we never tried this), afternoon tea (good) and evening snacks and drinks. The selection was good but not very extensive. You cannot compare this for instance with the typical range offered at lounges in Hong Kong, like the FS, RC of Conrad where you can have a true meal in the lounge with champagne. That being said, it was a nice place to relax for a while before going out to dinner. The staff at the lounge were very nice, made us feel welcome and remembered our names after a few days. (FS always makes a point of this, here it depends a bit on the part of the hotel)The restaurants are high quality. Breakfast in the main restaurant is excellent although the service can be a bit off when the hotel is completely full. They offer a nice variety and partly you can also order a la carte. This ensured we never got bored at breakfast although we stayed here for a long period. Quality wise the food is excellent.The wellness and pool area are nice as well and are a bonus in a hectic city like Tokyo. The pool temperature was OK but personally we would have liked it a bit warmer.All in all we had a truly wonderful stay in this very well run and well maintained hotel. It is among the best of all the Conrads we have stayed in so far. We would not hesitate to return. They are not (yet?) at the same level as the Four Seasons but it certainly is among the top hotels in this city and they will provide a true 5-star experience.

When my wife vented her anger, they brought the dish in 7 minutes. The manager at check out was very apologetic but this is truly a very poor experience. Somebody needs to address this issue.

You will be on sensory overload during your stay here. There are hundreds of details which makes this place what it is - from the nice beds, to the overhead shower, to the luxury toilets, to the separate bathtubs, to the incredible views. For my first time in Tokyo, I certainly felt spoiled. The conceriege was able to recommend an incredible okmakase Sushi experience in Ginza which was literally an 8-min walk from the hotel. It was by far the best sushi of my life. The hotel is close to several subways hubs so its easy to get around as well. You are also very close to the Tsukiji Fish Market here, so there are several cool spots within walking distance. The breakfast buffet at the hotel restaurant is first rate. This is also a fun spot for people watching as many locals come here for business meetings and afternoon tea to take in the view. The decor of the hotel is some amazing rich woods that you will no doubt be impressed with. The Conrad Tokyo reminds us what a fun experience going to a hotel can be.

We were warmly welcomed since we arrived in our cab. The downstairs lobby is where the luggage crew takes all your bags and they bring it directly to the room after you check in. Don't be surprised if you only see girls carrying your luggage, most of them are and they enjoy their job. The Lobby is located on the 28th floor and it has a very modern and modish look. The Front Desk counts with a long contemporary bench where you can relax in comfort in case there is someone else before you. Their staff always has a smile and welcoming face which makes you feel happy to be there. We stayed here 2 nights and we didn't want to leave. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious. The city view is stunning! I was able to see the Rainbow bridge from my room. I loved the Conrad Japanese style pijama they had in the room. The bathroom was very modern. The cleanliness is top notch! I would like to mention that Yuka is the most amazing and professional team member we had the pleasure to meet there. She is Wonderful! Her tone and demeanor makes you feel happy to be there. She took really good care of us and made us a reservation at the Japanese restaurant where we enjoyed sake tasting. She also provided great recommendations to add to our itinerary. The location of the hotel is superb, you can walk around and see many key places. You may start at the Hamarikyu Gardens and take the boat on the Tsukiji River. Enjoy the view of the hotel and high risers from the river. The Fish Market is right next to the park as well. A lot to experience around the area. The Shinbashi train station is walking distance from the hotel. If you are a Hilton Honors member, the Executive Lounge (also located on the 28th floor) has phenomenal views (high rises everywhere). The food is very light, small snacks but mostly sweets. We tried the Lobby lounge for a few drinks and snacks and it was just ok. The best restaurant was Cerise (by Gordon Ramsey) we had breakfast here and it was very good. The service was excellent! The Concierge Lambert was very friendly and willing to help. The whole staff was very professional. We will definitely be back! Not able to review: I didn't find time to try the Spa this time but it has great reviews. Note: remember it is Not ok to tip in Tokyo. This is not their culture.

Everything was well kept. All amenities were restocked perfectly during my 5 night stay, no matter how small are pieces of stuffs I used.)The location may not be right in Ginza but the Shiodome station is under the hotel and Shimbashi is within 5-10 minutes walking distance, as well as Ginza 8. We ended up walking almost everywhere, Ginza, Marunouchi, Yurakucho and Shinjuku can be reached by the Toei Oedo line from under the hotel. Friendly Limousine Bus can transfer you to and from both Haneda and Narita Airports. The stop is right in front of the hotel. Checkout was a bit slow for me but totally bearable. (last about 10 minutes, but expected less than 5, my bad.) Overall, I consider this a perfect stay, as good as my previous stay at The Peninsula.

From beginning to end, it's a stay I won't forget. As my husband and I arrived, the bellhop in the lobby freed us from our heavy ski gear. Staff escorted us to the elevator bank, where the sakura scent is unforgettable - I wish I could bottle it and take it home with me. The concierge greeted us upstairs with confirmation of our dinner for the following night at Jiro in Roppongi, a reservation he had secured for us a couple of months in advance. Desk staff was friendly and efficient, and when we mentioned wanting to see Tsukiji fish market in the morning, they gave us helpful maps and made sure we knew how early to arrive if we wished to see the tuna auction.We we delighted by our room. Our bed was extremely comfortable (and graced by two adorable little Conrad teddy bears), the closet was spacious, and the bathroom was delightfully roomy and modern. There was a tree in the entryway to boot.We had drinks at Twenty Eight every night of our stay, and we really enjoyed the bartender, our server, Peter, and the view. We had an excellent sushi dinner at Kazahana the first night of our stay, and there was something for everyone at breakfast at Cerise (try the smoothies!). We were impressed by the gym facilities (even if you don't swim, at least go look at the pool - it's beautiful).The location was ideal, as you can head downstairs toward several train options and not even have to head outside. We were a short train hop from Ginza (close enough that we walked back), the Shibuya scramble, the Imperial Palace, the Skytree, and Roppongi Hills, and a very short cab ride from Tsukiji. I will definitely be returning to Conrad Tokyo the next time I'm in town and very much look forward to it.","Chicago, Illinois","kitchy7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",8,5.0

The location was perfect for us. We like to walk, explore and take local transportation. The Conrad was very accessible to the subway and the JR. We also walked a lot in combination with using the subway. I was a little nervous when we arrived via the limo bus when I saw all the construction outside the hotel. It was not an issue while out walking. You had to pay a little more attention to when walking to the fish market or the gardens by the hotel as you passed through all the construction. But when in question there were plenty directing traffic who were willing to send you the right way. Arrival at the hotel was simple, they catered to bringing you up to the lobby and to your room. our room was a king with bay views that were simply fantastic. Very helpful when battling jet leg at 3:30 am to have the beautiful view. The breakfast in the morning was fantastic as well. So many choices and well done. Most Hiltons have gold members eat breakfast in the executive lounge but here we are gold and did not have those privileges here at the Conrad. It was better I hear to eat in the main dining room anyway and we enjoyed it. The views were great and so much food! We also enjoyed a light dinner at Cerise in the evening. Drinks are very expensive in the lounge. It is a beautiful room and often there was piano or other music. I am not sure if you are allowed to just go sit there without having drinks or food. It seemed a little intimidating and other then your room it seems the only place to just sit or gather. As you enter the lobby of the hotel is is all set up in a long layout where the different restaurants are off the side as you walk along. This hotel is sleekly decorated.

I fully expected to be blown away and to have my best hotel stay ever but sadly I left disappointed.First of all, let's start with the positives. The location of the hotel was excellent. Some people might say that the area around the hotel was pretty dead at night and on weekends. While it's true to some extent, I did find the location was perfect. Far removed from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet close enough to a couple of major train stations from where you can explore the city easily (one stop away from Ginza and Tokyo station!). Secondly, for a standard room, the size of the room was among the biggest I've ever had and everything was top quality (although the room wasn't without problems). Thirdly the service was very good (nothing that blew me away, but very good nonetheless) and the food offerings in the Executive Lounge and during breakfast was top notch. The selection wasn't as large as what I have accustomed to in Asia, but everything was very tasteful and of extremely high quality.Now to the not so good part. Granted I was staying on points (otherwise I will not be able to afford the exorbitant rate), but the upgrade for Diamond members was quite measly. The upgrade I received was just to the same type of room but with a different view. Yeah, the view was marvelous, but the hotel didn't even put me on the Executive floor (like other Conrads do) even though there were still rooms available. On top of that, the condition of my room upon closer inspection was quite disappointing. Dirty carpet (owing to the light carpet color) and visible wear and tear everywhere. The white office chair was dirty (again, due to the light color that they chose) and the chaise alongside the window was especially dirty that I had reservations about sitting on it. Shame. The room was beautiful and spacious, yet when I looked closer, I pitied those folks who paid the asking room rate. The room condition wasn't five star at all. Also my so called pre-assigned room wasn't ready when I checked in (at 3PM, the official check-in time). Mind you, I didn't request for a particular room number, but this was pre-assigned to me by the hotel and I had noted my arrival time of 3PM. Luckily they found another room that was ready at that time albeit on a different floor.Also the hotel didn't even disclose on their website that the Executive Lounge on the 37th floor was closed for renovation. Their reasoning? They have moved the Lounge space to a meeting room on the 28th floor and it still had the same service. But a meeting room is a meeting room and it is not a lounge space. The ambience is of course different. Shame. Service was good across the board, in that all staff members are polite and reasonably friendly and helpful, but it didn't feel any different when comparing to other hotels I have stayed in. In fairness perhaps it was because of the language barrier as I had observed that the staff interacted better with the Japanese guests but still I had expected better, especially due to this Japanese service myth that I had. Housekeeping service wasn't that great either. They did get better day by day, but they were not really that thorough, every single time they would miss some little details here and there, like not replenishing some amenities or clearing the rubbish bin, you know, all the details I would have expected a Five star hotel to get right. Shame. Lastly, the thing that really bothered me a lot was the presence of management at breakfast. Breakfast was supposedly a leisurely affair for me (and I would imagine for many folks as well) as I was on holiday and yet the presence of these managers (suited Caucasian and Japanese managers) made the breakfast experience quite stressful as I felt that I had to be on my best behavior at all times. I thought that their matronly presence was only to serve to oversee guests so that they didn't take too many buffet items and so that they didn't linger. And as other reviewers have noted, they would shower their attention to other guests (I would assume regulars and high spenders) and ignore the rest of us, plebeians. I bet they hope that we would finish and leave soon so that they could turn around the table for the next guests. Especially disappointing. One manager (Hispanic-looking) even didn't allow me to pass and the Japanese male manager didn't even smile back nor say anything when I smiled at him and said thank you when leaving the breakfast restaurant. Wow. My eyes did meet his.Overall, my high expectations on the hotel weren't met and I did feel somewhat uncomfortable every morning during breakfast due to the presence of the managers. I had booked this hotel only because I had HHonors points burning a hole in my pocket and that I had thought I would receive better service in a 290-room hotel versus one with many more rooms. However, other than a better room and amenities, I didn't think I receive better service overall. As much as I loved the location of the Conrad, I will save my points and stay elsewhere next time.","Madison, Wisconsin","lwkatya</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Madison, Wisconsin</strong>",30,4.0

The floor to ceiling window /wall allowed an expansive view of the Tokyo bay. Bed was very comfortable, however, the hotel sprayed the room ( Also in public area, I think) with an aroma that was too pungent, and suffocating in my opinion !

The not so Positive:Breakfast: Not as good as when the Hotel first opened, but still a pretty acceptable spread if you preferred to have your breakfast before you head out for the day ! Service: My biggest dissatisfaction with this hotel was that the service level varies, especially during the breakfast time. The management seemed to prefer certain customers and ignore others - on what basis I had no idea. I had observed during my 8 days stay how they lavished on certain customers and ignored others like they were transparent, why such differential treatment ? Weren't we all paying hotel guests, so why the discrimination ? Which I have to say put a very bad taste in my mouth, and therefore the 3 star rating ! Also as a reminder to the readers, the last Narita airport limousine service to Conrad Tokyo is at 16:05 ( check the hotel website), so if you can not make this last bus, you either have to take the express train to tokyo station or you have to take a taxi. In my case, I missed the bus, and because I had two large luggages with me so I had to take a taxi all the way from Narita airport to the hotel ! Would I recommend this hotel ? Probably not, given there are so many comparable offers in Tokyo that provides much better services ( I had stayed at some of them) than Conrad Tokyo, I would recommend people to go elsewhere !","Boston, Massachusetts","minamikaze</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",37,3.0

This was my first stay at the Conrad brand. It won't be my last!!The Conrad Tokyo is in an excellent location, both for the metro and for walking. We were able (as the weather was excellent) to walk to the fish market, the Meiji Shrine and Harajuku area, and all around the shopping in Ginza as well as the park lands around the Imperial Palace.In the evenings, we took the metro, with Shiodome station right at the hotel and Shimbashi station less than 5 minute walk away.Also, for airport access, the limo bus to/from Narita was a very convenient and comfortable way to arrive at the hotel, and ran exactly on time.The Conrad hotel has fantastic views on the harbour front side (where our room was located), as well as from 28 bar. The hotel starts on the 28th floor of the building, so I imagine all the rooms have pretty good views.The room itself was excellent for two friends travelling together. The living room was very spacious, and the layout of the closet area/bathroom/bedroom meant that each room could be separately closed off, while leaving the other rooms open for use - certainly made life easier!! The beds were comfortable and the room very quiet.My friend arrived quite early, and despite her HHonors Diamond status, was unable to have an early check-in due to the limited number of twin bed suites. It would have been nice for them to allow her access to the executive lounge, and/or spa area for a shower, but this was also refused.The hotel was happy to store her luggage for her while she waited, so she was free to go out and explore Ginza. We typically had breakfast and then left the hotel to go out sightseeing, having lunch out, and then returning in the late afternoon. Despite being out of our room for typically 5-7 hours, on three of our five days, the housekeeping was cleaning our room as we returned. I thought it strange to happen so often, particularly as we were out of the room fairly early. This was a little frustrating, as we were usually coming back to shower and prepare to go out for supper.Because we were on the executive floor, we took advantage of the lounge breakfast. The buffet includes dry cereals, oatmeal, meats and cheeses, fruits and vegetables, yogurts, breads and pastries, as well as asian dumplings and porridge toppings. And there is an egg station for fresh hot eggs. We were very impressed with the quality and selection of the lounge breakfast buffet.The afternoon tea was also excellent in the lounge, although we only partook on the days we returned to find housekeeping in our room.We ate at Kazahana one night, and had a teppanyaki set menu, which was great. The chef was friendly and informative, and we enjoyed the food, wine and view immensely.All in all, a great stay!","St. John's, Canada","NewfieGirl13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. John's, Canada</strong>",60,4.0

The hotel is conveniently located just South East of Ginza near the main market and some beautiful gardens. It occupies 10 floors (28-37) in a large building with beautiful views (urban or harbour) on all sides. As HHonors Diamond, I found the reservation team very responsive and efficient before our trip. We booked an executive floor suite and were kindly upgraded to a nicer suite. The suites are very tastefully decorated and have great bathrooms with a nice choice of toiletries (Aromatherapy Associate, Tara Smith, or Shanghai Tang which I really like) and beautiful views. However, we only got a limited late check out (but in fairness the hotel was very busy). One thing I found a bit disappointing was the executive lounge. It was extremely busy especially in the evenings, and on the second night, the lounge was unable to accommodate us when we came and asked us to return to the room where they would call us when there was space. When they called it was to say there was still no space and they had booked a table for us in the main bar. The bar is actually beautiful and much more quiet but drinks selection was even more limited than in the lounge and we got an uninteresting tapas plate instead of the more Japanese lounge hors d'oeuvre which was a disappointment. Even the evening we could make it to the lounge, the offerings were ok but by no means exceptional. For instance, having previously stayed at the Shangri La Tokyo, its Horizon club offerings for both breakfast and cocktails are vastly superior to the Conrad.Breakfast was very good. I went to the main restaurant to have a Japanese breakfast (not the best but still very nice) and choice and quality were plentiful. We also tried the Japanese restaurant for a wonderful kaiseki lunch, and a good but expensive sushi dinner.The Conrad is one step in luxury lower than the likes of the Mandarin Oriental, Shangri La, and Four Seasons, but it is still an excellent hotel and one where we'll return with pleasure.",,eurolondoner,147,5.0

Tired from the trip, I was greeted by a chap on the 27th floor. I asked to be checked in, and he kindly obliged. I was upgraded to a bay view room on the 32 floor after he saw that I was a diamond status. I am a frequent Hilton guest amongst other hotel chains. I have to say, this is the first Conrad I have stayed in and is definitely one of the upper echelon hotels I have seen in my lifetime. The decor and location is unprecedented to many others.Here are my standard good and bad points:Good:- Hotel staff tries to help wherever they can - Hotel staff tries to make themselves invisible to give guests privacy- The view is literally to die for. You will never get to see this side of Tokyo if you are just a normal tourist- Location is for business (next to tv station tower and a funny Shiodome train station. It is a 20 min walk to the closest JR station (Shimbashi)Bad:- Executive lounge is way too small to service so many American tourists in December- Lounge is always packed with people for the breakfast and dinner sittings in December- Business centre on the 27th floor. (Should be in executive lounge)If you are interested in my experience, please read on:I was offered Executive lounge access due to my Hilton Honors diamond status. Usually when you arrive at a Hilton affiliate hotel, they see you are a Diamond member, you will automatically get sent up to Executive lounge to check in. Lucky I wasn't considering how many people were in the lounge at the time.The room I was given had a view of Tokyo Bay. You can see planes coming in and out of Haneda. Good picture moments. The room was huge for Tokyo standards with a separate bathtub and shower. The mirror was huge and circular with bright lighting around. I immediately wanted one at home :) The bedding used were top quality and I had a good night sleep.Knowing how full the Exec lounge can get, I knew breakfast downstairs is a better option (at Ceres). Breakfast buffet was good. The first item of ""hot menu"" was free. Then the buffet was quite good with a variety of eastern and western foods. Quite happy from this experience.I asked for a late checkout. Usually it is not such a big ask given a diamond status. But I think most people who stay here is probably on a diamond or gold level given how much they are willing to spend on the rooms. I was given a 1pm checkout and it seemed non negotiable. I ended up leaving at 10am anyway.Would I come back again to this hotel? Probably if I wanted access to Haneda airport or on company business. However, I am keen to try other Hilton chains in Tokyo since there are so many of them.","Brisbane, Queensland, Australia","Jasper H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Queensland, Australia</strong>",28,4.0

The willingness to help with anything was tremendous. The location of this hotel worked well for me, as we wanted to visit each different neighborhood within Tokyo. There is a subway station in the basement, about a 10-15 minute walk from our room, depending on which subway line is needed. We took taxi's (Uber not that useful in Tokyo because the Taxi system is top notch), and the subway a little bit. We did have an earthquake, (7.2 mag) while I was there, which freaked me out.

Inside it is incredibly clean as you would expect and the service is good, however I would expect their English to be better. I do hate it when you go to a foreign country and visitors expect everyone to be speaking English and elsewhere I did not have this expectation however I did at the Conrad especially as it is situated in the business district. We found it incredibly hard to be understood by the concierge ( I do have an English northern accent but it isn't that bad...honest!) Also directions they gave us to restaurants did not work out and me being lost in the middle of Tokyo, hungry is not an ideal situation (just ask my husband). However we could walk lots of places and we worked a lot of things out ourselves. We used a JR pass during our time in Japan and I did ask at the hotel if we could use it for the Narita express which they said we could but they never advised us that you had to make reservations which did make things slightly stressful at the train station. I can't understand why they would not know that and pass the information on!Moving on to the good stuff! We told them at check in that it was our honey moon and as we were let into our room, cake arrived as a congratulations (nice touch and very prompt). The room was large, bathroom as big as most of the rooms we had stayed in other parts of japan and felt very luxurious. It was uber comfortable and we got a great nights sleep. The cleaners were excellent, toiletries were refreshed promptly and the turn down service was good too. Breakfast was a mixture of east & west as expected and again was as you would expect of a 5*.

I stayed on the 34th floor - the executive level, in a king suite. Upon entrance into the hotel, i was in total awe of the interior designs and the size of the lobby. The wooden like walls and earth-toned features created a warm and relaxing atmosphere. An ambiance i could never forget. I was welcomed to my room and could not have been happier with my double ensuite bathroom featuring a bathtub, shower and pretty cool robot type toilet! The bed was extremely comfortable, and the complimentary slippers and pyjamas were an awesome addition. My room had wall to ceiling glass windows with a fantastic view of the city, in particular the iconic rainbow bridge which lights all sorts of colours from 6pm until midnight. The button controlled blinds were definitely a favourite of mine. The massage service is obviously expensive, like the in room dining, (i paid $14.50AUD for a red-bull!), however it was an experience totally worth my $500AUD for a 50 minute upper body massage. The massage room and the customer service is unbeatable and I have never felt so relaxed as i did during the massage service and after. The relaxation room post massage is a delight, where you're served with your selection of a hot Japanese tea, where you can lay down on the provided comfortable banana chairs with a blanket for as long as you please to really enjoy the total massage experience. The in-hotel restaurants were yummy! Great location of the hotel - about a 20 min drive from Tokyo Haneda International Airport (depending on traffic). The hotel is situated next to a train station which offers a prominent subway service, although a bit tricky to understand the ticketing system at first, it is easily worked out! It is similar to the french metro system in Paris.The staff are amazing and their service is a solid 10/10. Concierge extremely helpful in suggesting dining locations whether it be for breakfast lunch or dinner if the in-hotel restaurants aren't your fancy for the evening.

I hadn't felt this way since navigating through the markets of Marrakech. This was the final leg of our last-minute Japan trip (booked only 4 days before travel) and we were celebrating my girlfriend beating cancer. The whole team went ABOVE and BEYOND to make this special. But when I say ABOVE and BEYOND, I don't mean just a nice card or bottle of champagne.

We were then told that at the reception they can't check us in as we were hotel members and could only be checked in on the club floor - again we were only given directions to the lift. The club floor - greeted by the club manager and was made to wait again to check in - all in all it took 45 minutes to check in! The guest room is good size and nicely appointed. The next day when we went to the club floor for our coffee, we helped ourselves to the Nespresso coffee and water. The club manager approached us and asked if we had taken a whole sleeve of Nespresso capsules for ourselves? Not sure if this was lost in translation but we told him we had used 3 capsules for our coffee and rather insulted that they could ask if we took a whole sleeve of Nespresso capsules? We told him it was insulting to ask us if they thought we took a whole sleeve of Nespresso as if we were stealing from them! The club floor provides complimentary tea, coffee, breakfast, drinks etc. to all hotel club members and to be asked such a question is truly insulting!

Our stay was for four nights. The primary reason for selecting the Conrad was the King bed availability (very few King beds in Japan) and it being next to Tsukiji market for our 2:30am wake-up call. We didn't have the opportunity to try to restaurants or bar at the Conrad but they looked busy. There was also live evening entertainment in the bar area. The room was amazing and so nice to come back to after a busy day sight seeing in Tokyo. The room was extremely quiet for the much needed afternoon cat naps. The service by hotel staff was excellent.

In fact, we asked for recommendations on 3 separate occasions and were disappointed all 3 times. In my opinion a concierge should provide unique insider information not just cookie cutter recommendations. My recommendation to other guests is to do your own research and have them assist you from there.

The staff were so amazing, and greeted us like they'd known us for years, and remembered all the little details - remembering our names by heart, asking us how our day was remembering specific details and always offering us a bottle of water before we headed out. Specific mention to Ari - the concierge/manager who always took the time to chat and answer questions and always greeted us so warmly and genuinely. He really loves his job and the social aspect of it and it definitely shows. All the staff spoke impeccable English and nothing was ever a problem. We drank in the bar which always have live background music - piano one night, guitar the next. Felt like we were in a movie. Drinks were well made and all the staff so friendly.

I initially hesitated among the other top-rated hotels in Tokyo. In the end we chose the Conrad based on the very good reviews and location.Among the 5 hotels we stayed at in Japan this was by far the best.I will start commenting on the location: despite some negative comments, as a tourist I can say location was excellent. The hotel has direct access to two major stations Shinbashi and Shiodome, which will allow you access to the main sites in Tokyo. It is worth noting however that these are large stations and required some walking. The hotel is also at walking distance from Ginza.Secondly regarding the hotel itself, it fully meets the standard of a luxury hotel. Decoration and amenities are superb. Rooms are extremelly well apointed and look very modern, with very stylish furniture and design. Service by the staff is also very good, in line with what you expect in this class of hotels. English command was excellent in all the people I interacted with (which is rare in Japan)The only drawback I can comment on is on the access to the swiming pool. To acess it I had to go through the spa entrance. There I had to go through access procedures by signing a document and was actually forced to read and accept a set of rules and regulations to access the swimming pool. I must admit I felt somehow patronized by this whole experience. In any standard western hotel I would have directly accessed the pool. Nevertheless this was just a minor glitch in an overall excellent experience.So to conclude, I can fully recommend this hotel. If you can make the effort of the high price tag, this is an excellent choice in Tokyo.","Toulouse, France","Pau L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toulouse, France</strong>",37,5.0

The hotel is beautiful and very modern. You'll enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and feel easily as home either at Cerise, the casual restaurant, or having a drink by the large fireplace in the lobby bar (live music some nights, excellent views of the Bay). Our room was an Executive Bay View Suite which the perfect amount of space for our family throughout the stay. The bathroom is awesome, with floor heating, large tub (my toddler swam in it) and luxe amenities are provided. I particularly enjoyed the doors which closed off the bedroom to the sitting area, so that if our toddler was napping we could comfortably hang out and watch TV, work, etc in the other room. There is also an additional half bathroom in the room and large walk through closet. I really can't say enough good things about the room, we loved it, and it was definitely worth booking if you need (or just want) the extra space. The Bay view was also nice considering generally, you get a lot of city view in Tokyo, we enjoyed that change of pace. With executive lounge access we enjoyed breakfast every morning, tea time and evening reception (appetizers and drinks) daily. The lounge is rather small but the staff was very helpful and became fast friends with our son. The hotel was excellent with housekeeping, turn down service (we even had some surprises left in our room) and timely room service. The gym is also small, but it does have a variety of equipment including extensive weights which can be hard to find here in Tokyo. There is also an indoor pool but guests under 4 are not allowed...at all. That was a huge bummer to us as a family with a toddler and one of my only complaints about the hotel. Spa is also nice, enjoyed a massage while we stayed, the locker rooms all have large whirlpools and saunas as well. Overall, we loved the Conrad, it really isn't a hotel geared toward families (in my opinion) however, they easily accommodated us during meals and our son even became somewhat of a staff favorite throughout our stay. Hope to enjoy future Conrad stays in our future!","Minato, Japan","Victoria S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minato, Japan</strong>",7,5.0

Combining an excellent location in Tokyo, walking distance to Ginza and close proximity to several subway lines, with extremely nice rooms and decor, and top-notch service, this has always been our favorite hotel in Tokyo (which has so many wonderful places). Even the regular rooms are spacious and nicely appointed, with comfortable, supportive mattresses, huge windows, large bathroom with separate tub and walk-in shower, and of course toilets with Toto Washlets.The most significant problem with this hotel is that smoking is permitted in open areas off the lobby. This forces guests to be subjected to tobacco smoke while walking between the guest elevators and the ground floor elevator (a long walk when one is suffering from severe tobacco allergy). Since Japanese people smoke in higher numbers than other modern countries, it's reasonable for the hotel to have smoking floors and smoking areas. However, it's entirely unreasonable for these areas to be open to the lobby. This eliminates any choice in tobacco exposure, forcing all guests to be exposed to heavy concentrations.The Executive Lounge is an inviting place to relax. There should be better signs explaining what the food items are, since people are constantly asking each other and lounge staff. When the hotel is at high occupancy, the lounge becomes stressfully overcrowded, with waiting lists for a table, and no room to walk to or from or at the buffet without getting in people's way and vice versa.We breakfasted at the Chinese restaurant at the far end of the lobby hallway, which boasts terrific views of the bay and a small but high-quality buffet, However, it too feels overcrowded even when only just over half the tables are occupied, since there isn't much space around the buffet, so it's stressful trying to maneuver around people and not block other people.The health club has a 25-meter indoor pool, but it's very narrow (two lanes wide). It is often undivided, but when crowded is divided into two lanes, one packed with adults and kids ranging from infants to teens, the other signed for circle swimming. However, circle swimming really needs multiple lanes segregated by speed, since it only works when everyone in the lane is doing roughly the same speed. It's a disaster when four or five people are paddling at 4-5 minutes a lap, and two or three people are trying to swim 1-2 minutes a lap, and someone wants to swim at 40 seconds a lap.",South Pole,"JetBoys</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Pole</strong>",270,5.0

Greatly situated, easy to reach by taxi, but also subway, for example from Haneda Airport, with a subway stop directly under the hotel, which also makes it easy to travel around this beautiful city. Discreet welcome at the ground floor and then straight up to the main reception, where the team is welcoming you as you just arrived in heaven. Special kudos to Ari, the guest relations Executive, who takes care of you personally right from the beginning. At the same time, he is loved and recognized by other guests all around the building. Even friends of ours back in Europe keep talking about his charm. Apart from this important fact, the hotel is beautifully laid out, quiet, discreet, elegant, stylish and offers much more than you can take in. Beautiful restaurants with great and attentive team members, tasty food and cocktails - just had a fantastic lemongrass Cosmopolitan. The breakfast is absolutely stunning, great a la carte egg dishes and do try the orange brioche or coconut muffin - excellent. The rooms are comfortable, luxurious, super clean and offer all the personal touches you could imagine. Dont forget to download the Conrad Concierge app, may be for other stays, as here the team is so great and attentive that you wont even get a chance to check the app! Also, dont miss to check out the spa, roof top in door pool, just amazing and relaxing after a day out. All in all, I doubt there are much better places in town, if you are looking for a luxurious, but not pretentious base in Tokyo, for business or pleasure - we will for sure be back and recommend to others - you should book!","Vienna, Austria","Stefba2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vienna, Austria</strong>",10,5.0

The area this hotel is in is much like all of them... It is above a major station, it is walking distance (10 min) to Ginza and it is across from the most idyllic park that you can spend an afternoon in. So that being said we arrived to the hotel that is incorporated into a much larger building and located on the upper floor. We were met at valet and escorted up to check in... at the elevator they meet you and make you feel like you are the only one staying there as they take you to check in. Our room was not ready but we sat and had High Tea (see pics) and enjoyed the incredible view of the bay. Once our room was ready we were taken to our Suite that was modern yet warm and probably the most well laid out hotel suites I've stayed in. There is an entry foyer with a small visitor bathroom you walk past a double entry walk in closet towards a spacious and well decorated living room, office space and views to die for! Off of that area is the master suite that can be completely separated from the living room if you have guests visiting by simply sliding the doors closed. The master suite has a wonderful bed and sitting chaise lounge to enjoy the view. Both of these main spaces have large LED TV's and excellent lighting. Off of the master suite is the master bathroom with excellent walk in shower and deep soaking tub. Double sink and WC separately enclosed. Did I mention heated floor! You can also access the walk in closet from the bathroom side as well as the foyer (and all of your cloths or mess can be closed for no one to see!). The suite/room is excellent. The pool and spa can be fully accessed and is shared by the residence from what I could understand but there was never anyone in either place. It was like using a private spa with all the service and excellent amenities you would want and it was included in our stay. The hotel has several restaurants beside the lobby area which is where they have the bar and high tea. We tried China Blue and it was exceptional and from what I understand a few years back a Michelin star dining experience. It still could be in my mind. We did not try the other restaurant nor have the buffet for breakfast but we did have room service for breakfast and dinner. Service, presentation and food were spot on. They even accommodated a special non menu food request. This is our place to stay in Tokyo and that is not given away easily especially with the quality hotels and services that are available. It was not stuffy but had 5 star appeal. Part of why you stay are the amenities but a big part is the service. From valet to room service we were treated with a response that insured they cared about giving only the best. Ari and Yuku set the tone for many days for us. They would alway be meeting us at the elevator and going beyond to help our special requests. Ask for them but likely if you meet a sweet stylish man and friendly lady somewhere near the lobby you will be engaged with them and they will make your stay even better.

But you can also walk to the hotel from JR Shimbashi station (Yamanote line), and it takes only 15 minutes. It is possible to go from JR Shimbashi station to the hotel completely by the underground, which means you don't need an umbrella even on a rainy day. There are a drug store (Shiodome drug), a convenience store (Famima) just down the escalator from the entry of the hotel as well as some other shops. The hotel is on the upper floors of a tower, and the reception is on the 28th floor, if I remember correctly. There are city view rooms and bay view rooms. The rooms on higher floors are executive rooms with access to the executive lounge. The executive lounge is very good, offering breakfast, afternoon tea and pre-dinner cooktail/appetizer.We had a bay view room, with a nice view of Hamarikyu garden and Tokyo bay. When we arrived, we found a Conrad duck, and on returning after cocktails, the turndown service left us two small Conrad teddy bears, which was a nice surprise. A small detail, but there was only one box of tissue paper in the rather spacious room, which,, we thought was a little strange for a hotel of this class.For breakfast in the executive lounge, there was a good choice of food and drinks. There was even a cook, who prepared different kinds of omlets. We noticed that smoking was allowed in the restaurant next to the lobby, which is not really agreeable.As a whole, we think this hotel is a very good choice to stay near central Tokyo, as Shimbashi is one of the stations of JR Yamanote loop trains, which allows you to go todifferent parts of Central Tokyo easily, with easy access to Narita airport (Limousin bus from the hotel, Narita Express from Tokyo central station) and to Haneda airport (Limousin bus from the hotel, Monorail from Hamamatsucho), for instance.","Lyon, France","Gemini6_tadvisor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lyon, France</strong>",163,5.0

The location of the hotel is not at a busy area but centrally located above the Shiodome Subway station and within close proximity to everywhere. We took a car or cab everywhere, and everywhere took us no more than 10-15mins. The hotel is located above an office building at the 28th floor, thus every room should have decent view of the park across. It's a really huge park (almost like NYC central park). lovely.From the doormen to the room hospitality service staff , everyone of them is Super! We have stayed at many lovely hotels and combined with the famed Japanese manners, every member of the team at Conrad takes customer service to a different level. I must say, we are very impressed with the level of service, almost everyone remembers us upon our return 2 weeks later. Room service staff made special efforts to get to know my teen daughter/ son who opted to stay in for in room dining a couple of times making their stay extra special. We had breakfast included on the club floor during both stays so I can't comment on the breakfast downstairs. However, in room dining and the restaurants downstairs are very expensive if you ask me. We are foodies and we go everywhere to hunt for awesome food and won't mind paying for it, but I am not sure I will pay for a $30 salad.Spa is very expensive as well but well worth it! I had massages and made a couple of purchases too. Wifi is not included so everyone has to purchase a pkg or you can use the public wifi at the lobby. Purchased wifi is glitchy. I wasn't pleased with that but it did not bother me too much since I only use it to check emails. As with all other hotels, they tend to overbook and on our return on the last leg of our tour the front desk personnels could not find us the adjoining King suite we reserved and was very professional to honour the booking by providing us an alternative suite compensating for the one we had booked. All worked out with the help of Mr Ari and his collegue. Ari is such a gem to the hotel, he is always smiling and making awesome conversations with everyone making us feel 100% at home.

The check in process was thorough and efficient as we were given all the details of our stay.Our room was modern, very spacious and airy and fully equipped with amenities. The curtains and blinds were powered electrically. We also like the glass wall to the bathroom which has electrically powered timber venetian blinds. The blinds can be set at different heights with the venetian blades at any angle. So the blinds can be used to adjust for any preferred lighting level during daylight hours.The full length couch along the width of the room below the window was so useful and comfortable. The bed and sheets were very comfortable, the pillows smelt of lavender and we slept very well.We were impressed with the excellent attention to details in the room- I noticed the bathroom mat never moves out of position as there was a non slip mat under the former. Only one wishlist item missing from our room, according to my wife, was a full length mirror.We had the buffet breakfast in the restaurant which offered American, Chinese and Japanese food. Service was swift, no sooner than a plate or cup is empty, then it is taken away. The variety and quality of food were very, very good.

There were also a good range of snack food in the afternoon.Finally, my wife tried on a dress in a shop in a shopping mall 20 minutes by Metro from Shinbashi Station on our second night and left her long necklace in the fitting room.

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by English speaking staff. Almost every staff member I interacted with seemed to have a good command of the English Language. The service was impeccable from check-in, concierge services to breakfast and cocktail hour at the club level lounge. The staff were professional, very friendly and communication was effortless.The room was gorgeous and the view of the city, bay and gardens were simply spectacular!!!. The lap pool is on the smaller side, but it's so amazing! My only complaint was that one of the sinks did not drain. Before we went out for the day, my husband called the front desk or housekeeping for them to fix the drainage problem while we were out. When we got back that night, it was not fixed. As we were too tired and it was too late to have someone come in to do it, and I really wanted the use of both sinks (3 people including our son), I ended up fixing the problem myself (which turned out to be a fairly simple fix), but it did annoy me. However, the overall experience at this hotel was so amazing that it made it easy to ignore.It would be nice if the Sauna/bath hours were a little longer. I waited until later to do my lap swimming so it was less crowded, but by the time I was done swimming at 9:45pm, I had no time to enjoy the amenities in the bathroom. We had just stayed at the Sheraton near Disney and theirs closed at 1 am, so I was really bummed that it was closed at 10pm here.I have a suggestion for the hotel Concierge (amazing staff, by the way). When giving information regarding the tour of the Fish Market, it might be a good idea to mention the location of where to get the tickets. My husband and I left before 3 am to walk over but there were no signs to direct us on where we were supposed to go to get our tickets. We read the information sheet given, but unless we missed it, there was no map indicating where the check-in was. We had bad directions from the workers at the market and were led deeper into the restricted sections. We were lost and no one were willing to help. By the time we got to where we were supposed to, they had just given out the last ticket. As such, we missed the tour and were deeply disappointed because doing Tsukiji Market tour was the reason why we chose to stay at the Conrad.  Aside from some of the issues we experienced, the hotel stay itself was impressive.","Redondo Beach, California","Jebrass</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redondo Beach, California</strong>",16,5.0

Thanks especially to Lambert, who helped manage breakfast in the main restaurant. He was super-friendly and recognized us each day. He provided helpful sightseeing tips for a later trip to Kyoto and also suggested a favorite Japanese white wine. The location is very good and a nice refuge from the bustle of Tokyo. The hotel is close to both the fish market and Ginza. We used public transit extensively. The Shiodome station is right outside the hotel but only serves one subway line as a local stop. The Shimbashi stop is a 7-8 minute walk and has many more connections. (The Shiodome stop is also on the monorail, which goes to Odaiba. I’d recommend taking that for some interesting views of the bay and just a nice break from walking.)In terms of HHonors, I made this reservation last year using points as a Diamond, but slipped down to Gold this year. The basic award room is a city view. They offered us an upgrade to a bay-view room, or a city-view room with lounge access, but not both. We chose the bay view room since we typically aren’t around to enjoy the hotel happy hour. Very happy with that decision, since the breakfast in the hotel restaurant was excellent and we loved waking up to the bay view from the room. (But the city view is still interesting and we probably would have been fine with that, also.)One con is the smoking allowed in the lobby and bar area, but it wasn’t a huge deal – just a little unpleasant. I’d also note that the water pressure in the room sinks was very low, enough that we would have asked for a fix if we’d stayed another day.

I know what to typically expect when you pay for hotel food, however i didn't feel like it represented the quality and affordability of the many many other food options that where less than a 5 minute walk away.Very happy customer of this hotel.",New York,"Christine K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",11,5.0

Executive Club lounge: they provide a full breakfast (featuring an omelette chef), a wide range of snacks and canapes during the day, and the evening presentations of cocktail snacks are exceptional. Each night they are completely different, very sophisticated and tasty. See photo. Location: in Shiodome is convenient to many metro lines, very near Tsukiji Market (for now), walking distance to Ginza and across from Hama-rikyu gardens the which is a beautiful park / traditional Japanese garden to look at from the hotel or to visit. It contains tea houses, shrines and beautiful nature, right in the middle of Tokyo. Rooms: are large, have floor to ceiling windows with sweeping views. They are well equipped, with all the luxury amenities you would expect. Gym: it’s a well-lit space on the 29th floor overlooking the pool and views of Shiodome skyscrapers. For cardio there are 5 techno gym treadmills of latest state of the art touchscreen technology, some bikes and steppers. Resistance training equipment includes all the basic machines: chest press, leg press, leg extension, leg curl, lat pull down, obliques. Free weight area features a Smith rack and benches with various free weight plates. There are dumbbells up to 30 kilos. There is also a kinesis machine. A small studio next to the main gym has stretching mats and Swiss balls. They occasionally have yoga and pilates classes in the studio but this is not complimentary to guests. The men’s changing rooms contain a sauna, a steam room and several individual hot tubs. Concierge: I had a great experience with them when I gave them the brief of finding a store where I could buy yuzu – they spent a fair amount of time looking into it and found an amazing store that is walking distance from the hotel which sells products exclusively from Kochi prefecture.

As the years, passed, even as that hotel began to fade at the edges and many new, more glamorous properties entered the Tokyo market, I found the Okura to be the epitome of gracious, unobtrusive service. Even brief experiments with the Park Hyatt and the Mandarin Oriental, as beautiful/spectacular as they are did not induce a change of heart. But, alas, after my final stay at the Okura last August (the Main building’s final weekend before its scheduled demolition), I found myself without a preferred hotel in Tokyo…Last month, as I began planning a birthday trip, I was surprised to read the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor about the Conrad Tokyo. A Conrad? A part of the Hilton portfolio? I just couldn’t see it as a replacement for my beloved Okura. But fellow travelers on TripAdvisor have more than once introduced me to wonderful properties around the world so I decided to give it a try.To skip to the punch line, my experience at the Conrad was AMAZING!I stayed four nights in an Executive King room overlooking Tokyo Bay (an unexpected and very welcome upgrade from my City View room.) The view was breathtaking and the room was spacious and airy with a large, beautiful bathroom. Less than an hour after arriving in my room, an attendant rang the doorbell to offer me a slice of birthday cake; later that evening, I returned to the room (housekeeping makes up the rooms twice everyday) to find a teddy bear with a Happy Birthday tag on my bed…are you kidding me…? :-)Yes, the property is stunning; rooms and public spaces are beautiful with spectacular views (great Martinis at the bar) and the location is a dream: easy walk to Ginza; Tsukiji (go soon if you want see it in its present location); and Shinbashi Station via underground walkway. But what sets this property apart is the standard of customer service one encounters at every turn. From the moment I stepped out of a taxi to the moment I was escorted to the Airport Limousine Bus, I was made to feel like a special and honored guest. And believe me, I am allergic to over-the-top, artificial niceness – somehow the staff at the Conrad Tokyo manages to get it just right.The Executive Lounge is small but cozy with kind, attentive service; on the weekends, the staff bring you composed plates with a selection of the evening’s appetizers and snacks to enjoy with your preferred drinks. One morning, I tried breakfast in the main restaurant (included, if you like, when you stay in an Executive floor room) and although the food and ambience were wonderful, I found that I preferred breakfast in the Executive Lounge which even has a chef on hand to cook your eggs to order. At the very last minute, the Executive Lounge concierge staff was able to book a lunch reservation for me at Kyubey; they must have informed the restaurant that it was my birthday as the restaurant not only had created a special decorative place setting for me but even assigned me my own private sushi chef for lunch!While I could go on at length about the many kindnesses I experienced while at the Conrad, I will use the following as an illustration. Having checked out and done a bit of last minute shopping in Ginza, I was sitting in the main floor lobby waiting for the Limousine Bus to Narita Airport. Deepak, a member of the customer relations staff whom I had met the day before, saw me and immediately came over to make sure I was alright. When he realized I had a bit of a wait, he stayed with me and we had chatted until the bus arrived at which point he walked me to the bus and stood, waving, until I was on my way. This is the sort of kindness that I have only experienced at the very best Japanese hotels among which I now count the Conrad Tokyo.I am already planning my return and I urge any fellow traveler who relishes the idea of luxury accommodations and impeccable service in one of the world’s most exciting cities to give the Conrad a try.","Chicago, Illinois","lapyramide</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",38,5.0

The bathroom is huge for a Japanese 5 star hotel. And if you were to ask me, why stay in the Conrad with such an expensive price tag with a plethora of options available in a mega city like Tokyo....I would say the ace of this hotel is the concierge. Being a non-Japanese speaker, Tokyo was a destination for us to do a ""Foodie Trip"". Many restaurants have difficult to pronounce, say, and or read Japanese signs and names. We used the Conrad concierge for almost every restaurant reservation we needed. This where we extracted value from the high costs of the room. Overall, if you stay in Tokyo for 2-3 nights only.

In the past when we've redeemed loyalty points our experience has sometimes been that we're treated like ""second class"" guests because the hotel doesn't see cash revenue from the room rental for us. In another instance, the hotel assigned us to a horrible room. When we went to the front desk to ask for another room, the Front Desk person actually said what do you want for free? It was in this context that we were wondering how we would be received at this totally elegant, and ultra luxurious hotel.OH MY GOODNESS! Our fears couldn't have been more misplaced. From the moment the doorman took our bags all the way until someone walked all the way to the lobby with us we immediately felt comfortable and welcomed as good friends might. The lobby was up on the 28th floor with the restaurants and bar. The view was absolutely stunning. Again we were greeted warmly. We were able to take an earlier train so we arrived much earlier than we anticipated so our room was not ready yet. The front desk had someone show us up to the Executive Lounge on the 37th floor to wait while they prepared our room. No sooner did we relax with tea and scones then the Concierge came to present us with the key to our room. We went down to the 36th floor and walked into our Executive King room with a stunning view of Tokyo Bay. We had sushi in the hotel's Japanese restaurant that evening with not only incredible choices, but an absolutely delightful time with the engaging sushi chef. I can't possibly say enough about how genuinely welcomed we have felt, nor how wonderful everyone on the staff has treated us! Even with a couple of odd requests from us, the staff was spot on. This is a wonderful example of what the Conrad brand stands for. Clearly the Tokyo Conrad sets a high bar for service and concern for their guests.

And this time, I booked a trip to Tokyo to enjoy the cherry blossom and to meet some Japanese friends in town. Conrad Tokyo is on my wish list for couple years, because of its reputation and great story I heard from friends who stayed here before, and this time I could arrange to book my stay at this beautiful hotel.The hotel location is great; only a few minutes walk to the Shinbashi train station and only a few stations away from Tokyo, Ginza or Shibuya station. The hotel lobby located at the upper level, on 28th floor, so you will be 'wowing' with the view of Tokyo bay.The hotel room is well designed with a touch of luxury and contemporary Japanese arts. With comfortable king-size bed and huge bathroom with free-standing bathtub, large shower area and big round mirror, I enjoyed my stay very much. The hotel also prepared luxury bath amenity for me as I did request from its concierge App a week before I arrived, well done!A variety of TV channels and free WIFI internet keep me entertained during 3-night stay here. I also love their complimentary french press coffee and Japanese green tea as it goes well with delicious pastry and cake I bought from the train station when returning from shopping and a city tour; visiting beautiful temples, Malls, Tokyo Tower and famous parks and gardens with Sakura trees.Breakfast is great! Premium quality, a variety of food and fresh items. The restaurant staff is friendly and helpful, they all look after me very well. The hotel also has an indoor swimming pool and boutique spa, located on the same floor, for you to relax.

However, this was my first time back visiting Tokyo after 20 years so I decided to treat myself a little. We went all out with my HHonors points and spent 300K points for 5 nights. It was worth every bit of it.To start, it is located just 2 blocks or 5 minutes walking from the nearest subway station so I highly recommend getting those day passes or ones that work for all subways. The hotel itself is upclass and smells new. The room is spacious and since my sister-in-law decided to tag along last minute, we weren't surprised to learn that there will be a upcharge since the room is designed for two. What did surprise us was how cheap it was, just 5000 yen a day, and they even added an extra bed, not a futon, so everyone can rest comfortably.One day we visited the Doraemon museum that was about an hour away and my wife left something in the women's room. By the time she realized it, the museum had already closed and we don't speak a word of Japanese (we can get by and order food but that's about it). We reached out to the front desk and this lady promised to follow up for us the next morning. Sure enough we got a call at 9am the next morning and was happy to learn that they have located the lost article and would do a same day delivery for a small fee (about $25 USD). Since our flight was the next day we had no choice, but holy cow the delivery guy showed up on a motorcycle (race helmet, racing suit, the whole nine yard) with our stuff 2 hours later.

We have previously stayed at The Imperial Hotel and my husband has stayed at many 5 star hotels in Tokyo on business. Husband suggested The Peninsula or The Palace but I found the Conrad Tokyo on Tripadvisor and wanted to stay here due to its location and very positive reviews. The Conrad Tokyo is excellent in every aspect and surpassed expectations! It is the only place we will stay when we return to Tokyo!We received a warm greeting at the front desk and upgraded bay view room #3611 which was ready within 15 minutes of our arrival. I normally book the night before when I arrive early in the morning but took a chance as we have Hilton Diamond status. We took this time to speak with the lobby concierge (unfortunately I can't remember her name) who worked hard and went out of her way to obtain great seats behind home plate to a sold out Tokyo Giants baseball game. The tickets were delivered to our room that evening along with directions to Tokyo Dome. Thank you! The executive room overlooking Hamarikiyu Gardens and the bay was new, impeccably clean, comfortable and very well furnished. It was quiet and provided an excellent nights sleep. We could have used a few more drawers tho as we had brought lots of clothing with us for a month long trip. Housekeeping and turn down service were also excellent. The lounging sofas against the window were very comfortable and a great play to read or just soak in the beautiful view. The bathroom with a view was excellent. We loved the little stuffed Conrad bears they put on your pillow! The personalized welcome note from The General Manager and box of sweets were very much appreciated. There was no question this was a true 5 star hotel.Service in the executive lounge was excellent. They made dinner reservations for us at China Blue, Kazahana, Tempura Tenkuni and at Inakaya East in Rappongi. Unfortunately they were not able to obtain tickets to Eric Clapton for us at the last minute regardless of the cost. I don't think they have concert ticket brokers in Japan. Breakfast service was great including a chef to cook eggs if you so desired. Nice variety of appetizers at night. We were disappointed there was no Rum available to enjoy a Rum & Coke cocktail at night so we opted for good Japanese beer instead. Very friendly, professional staff.Dinner and service at the hotel's Chinese Restaurant China Blue was very good and held its own compared to the Chinese food we ate two weeks prior in both Shanghai and Beijing. Teppanyaki dinner and cocktails (No wine) at the hotel's Kazahana restaurant was the most expensive dinner for 2 we have ever had at 81,785 yen or $750 US, but it was well worth it!!! We had our own chef in a private room with a view of the bay. From the salad, to the sashimi, whole live lobster, huge live abalone, 2 types of Kobe beef, vegetables and fried rice everything was PERFECT! Our dessert was served in the restaurants lounge. It was a most enjoyable evening. We must do it again!We had drinks on 4 occasions at Twenty Eight which is their lobby bar/lounge. While they prefer you to have a reservation, we were seated each time with no problem. There was both live music fas well as a DJ at night. Smoking is allowed although they do have a non smoking section by the DJ. Drinks are expensive for Tokyo standards, but you are paying for the beautiful view. We were joined for drinks one night by our son who flew in for the weekend and stayed 2 buildings down in a luxury apartment with one of his high school friends who is going to University in Tokyo. They were underdressed by my standards but we still received excellent service.We loved the location of this hotel in Shiodome. Perfect for Hamarikyu Gardens and the ""water bus"" to Asakusa, Tsukiji fish market, shopping and The Lion Beer Hall in Ginza. We also walked to The Imperial Palace, Hibya Park, Yasukuni Shrine and the War Museum but chose to take the Metro back.What stood out the most this visit was a wonderful gesture by Deepak at the front desk. We had a very nice conversation with him at check in while the concierge was on the phone securing the baseball tickets. When we returned to our room in the evening on the first night our doorbell rang. Deepak had sent up a lovely tray of fruit along with a very nice note. This touched my husband deeply. We enjoyed speaking with him throught out our stay. He is an asset to the hotel and should be commended.If it was possible to give this hotel 6 stars, we definitely would. We are 'younger"" retirees and travel extensively. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel as THE BEST hotel in Tokyo. It is among the BEST in the world.

I decided to splurge on a massage which was, by far, an excellent decision. The entire gym, pool (don't miss this) and lounge area are peaceful and inviting. My massage therapist, Ran, was excellent. The experience began with a cup of tea, followed by the massage, and then off to the relaxation room - a quite dim room with comfy couches and down poufs. Ran brought me more tea, some light snacks and left me to take in the whole experience. Once done in that room, I adjourned to the spa where they offered individual jacuzzis, a steam room with eucalyptus and a dry sauna. Frankly, i did not want to leave. I only stayed one night, but it was just perfect. The Ginza area is within walking distance and as others have mentioned, the metro is under the hotel, which is very convenient.

We stayed three nights, and the Conrad Tokyo was by far the best of the bunch. Even before our arrival, Mieko, a member of the concierge team, spent hours exchanging numerous emails to help us plan our itinerary for our stay in Tokyo. She also made reservations for us at Sukiyabashi Jiro, Kondo, and Toriki well before our arrival to Japan (there was a miscommunication regarding Toriki, which she fixed after we arrived at the Conrad). Though we were not staying at the Conrad until the final 3 nights of our trip, we still emailed Mieko with questions instead of asking the concierge at the other hotels (Gora Hanaougi, Hilton or Park Hyatt). We had communicated with them prior to arriving and all three places gave us the sense that we were bothering them, they answered with short responses. Whereas we could sense Mieko wanted to help and all her responses were thorough and she was more than willing to answer follow up questions.) Another example, while staying at the Park Hyatt (we wanted to check out the hotel bc of the movie), we asked the concierge if he could direct us to a store to purchase Suntory whiskey. The concierge pretty much told us there were no places in Tokyo, that it was all sold sold out, and told us that we might be able to purchase it at duty free at the airport (but he didn't offer to call to find out if we could or not). Luckily, we did not take the Park Hyatt's information as the final word. I emailed Mieko and within an hour, she sent directions to a store she had contacted that she confirmed had Suntory in stock.! A completely different level of service!The hotel was gracious enough to upgrade us to a Bay View Suite since we were celebrating my partner's birthday. And Mieko had a very nice spread (fruits, cake, chocolates) sent up to our room! The room was very nice, and the view was great! You could choose from 4 different brands of bath products. We didn't know which we preferred, so they provided a set of products for all four brands! The breakfast downstairs was very nice (though we'll admit the breakfast at the Grand Hyatt Taipei was nicer, with more variety). And the Executive Lounge was very nice, with a good selection of sweet and savory offerings, and also a good selection of drinks. Each evening, we looked forward to going to the lounge after a day of sight seeing for some bubbly and snacks, before we went back out for dinner. The hardest part was having enough self control not to eat too much in the lounge!The Airport Limousine bus picks up directly from the Conrad and we decided to take that to Narita since we had 4 bags and did not want the hassle of going up and down the train stations. We purchased a one way ticket plus one day unlimited subway pass combo ticket from the ticket office at Shinjuku Station.Ask the hotel staff for detailed directions on how to walk to Shimbashi station. We walked the ""long way"" a couple of times before we figured it out.The Lounge had views of the city while we had a bay view and the bay view is definitely the nicer view, in our opinion.Everyone at the hotel provided excellent service and we will definitely try to stay at the Conrad Tokyo again the next time we are in Tokyo!","Dallas, Texas","Hoong Nan Y</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",101,5.0

The hotel is within a ten-minute walk of Shimbashi station and directly located above the Shiodome subway making it ideal for those who wish to travel around Tokyo – Shimbashi station itself is only a four-minute train journey to the nearest major station, Tokyo station.As we had three suitcases, and given how busy trains around Tokyo can become, we made two separate journeys in which the reception team very kindly stored our suitcases until the room was ready. There was a couple of hours wait as the previous guest had bought a late checkout for 3 PM, albeit this was not an issue as the receptionist very kindly offered us a different room or use of the executive lounge straight away as we had already upgraded via the Conrad Tokyo website before we flew to Japan. Given the excellent standards of the hotel, I fully believe the wait was an exception. We chose to wait for the room to be turned around instead of taking up the offer of a new room as the hotel is situated very close to the Ginza district meaning there was plenty to do. We also chose to appreciate the bar for an hour – the Sakura drink range is highly recommended! The room itself located on the 37th floor was grand – spacious, yet paired with a cosy feeling. The two small Conrad teddy bears and rubber duck were a nice personalised touch. The room was accompanied with a spectacular view overlooking the Tokyo bay and Hamarikyu Gardens. If there was any view I would choose as my favourite in Tokyo, it would be this one. It was the icing on the cake for an already fantastic room and stay. The upgrade to the executive floor cost around 10,000 yen per night but was worth every penny. This included access to the executive lounge with complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea, snacks and cocktail hour – between us; we comfortably covered the cost of 20,000 yen. A big thanks to the all the staff for their friendly attentiveness and also help with printing our boarding passes – they are a credit to your exceptional establishment.","Whitby, United Kingdom","Ryan C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Whitby, United Kingdom</strong>",11,5.0

This is right up there with some of the other excellent Conrads I've stayed at, namely Hong Kong and Dubai. Excellent property.I could tell that the property was going to be beautiful based on pictures online, but I was a tad worried about the location. Not knowing Tokyo very well, and being there as a tourist, I just wasn't sure where to stay. The Conrad didn't seem terribly central, since it's right up against Tokyo Bay, although it is close to Ginza, which I know is a major shopping/tourist district. Well, location turned out to be fine. Tokyo is so big and spread out, you are going to be taking the subway a lot no matter where you stay. Thankfully, the Conrad has very easy access to several subway lines, so it's pretty easy to get just about anywhere. And you can also walk to nearby Hamarikyu Gardens, Tsukiji fish market, Kabuki-za theater, and Ginza shopping.The Conrad itself is a beautiful hotel. It occupies the top 10 or so floors of an office building, but you'd never know it once inside. The lobby is on the 28th floor and has amazing views that take your breath away as soon as you get off the elevator. Very high ceilings give the whole lobby a very glamorous feeling, including the swanky bar/lounge off to the side where they have live singers at night.The room was also excellent. Chic design without being gimmicky. I love the modern elegance vibe that Conrad has going, so much better than many of the stuffy old Ritz and Four Seasons properties. The room itself was the standard king room but I was upgraded to bay view, which is the same room, just on the side of the property that overlooks the water. Rooms are very large (over 500 square ft), especially for Tokyo. Lots of technology in them, but easy to use. Gorgeous finishes, very quiet, fantastic views. My only small complaint would be about the mattress, which was VERY firm. You notice it as soon as you sit on it, feels like you just sat on a concrete slab. But, surprisingly, we didn't have any problems sleeping on it and didn't feel uncomfortable. I would prefer a softer, lush mattress where you sink in and feel like you're floating on clouds -- definitely not the experience here, but it wasn't really a problem.The only other negative I can think of for this hotel is that it's not 100% non-smoking. I know a lot of people in Japan still smoke, so maybe all/most hotels allow smoking to some degree, but I just find it so off-putting. We were on a non-smoking floor, so the only time we ever smelled smoke was in the lobby, where I think they allow smoking in the bar/lounge area. It wasn't very bad, but you could definitely get the faint odor of smoke sometimes as you passed through the lobby.As a Hilton Diamond member, we had access to the executive lounge on the 37th floor, which was fantastic. Beautiful space with more incredible views (toward the city, so a nice change from the bay view in our room) and a nice spread throughout the day. We'd go up there to get water, maybe have a coffee, and just relax and enjoy the view. The staff there were very attentive and friendly. After our first visit to the lounge, they remembered us on future visits and didn't ask for a room key or anything to prove we were entitled to access. Nice.As a Diamond, breakfast is incredible. You can go to the executive lounge, where they have a pretty nice buffet and cooked-to-order eggs, but you can also go to one of the main restaurants (Collage) in the lobby. They have a larger buffet there, plus you can order one main dish from the menu at no charge (all of this is free for Diamonds). It's a pretty swanky restaurant space, so the whole experience feels very luxurious. And they have a ton of staff constantly checking in on you, refilling drinks, taking care of anything you need.In fact, the staff throughout the hotel are superb. There are always a lot of staff milling around just looking to intervene if you needed help in any way. They all spoke English well, were extremely warm and friendly, and just made you feel welcome. I loved that we could approach the front desk at any time and always find someone to help us without having to wait in line. There is only one concierge, so occasionally they would be busy helping someone else, but we never waited more than 5 minutes to get to them. I also called down to the front desk a couple of times from the room and they would always answer immediately, including greeting me by name (a pet peeve of mine is hotels who never answer the phone at the front desk).Oh, I should point out the elevators. I've stayed in hotels where elevators are a problem (not enough of them, long waits, overcrowded, etc), but never had elevators stand out as a *positive* experience -- but that was the case here. They are super fast, plentiful, and just very pleasant to be in. I know, it sounds crazy, but it was a joy to take the elevator. One feature I loved is as soon as you hit the button to call the elevator, one of the banks immediately lights up to tell you that's going to be the one you board. It might take a minute or two for the elevator to come, but it knows right away which one will be coming. Oh, and once you get on, as soon as you hit the button for your floor, the doors close right away -- loved that.We didn't use the gym on this trip, but we did check it out and it was nice. The lap pool was beautiful, with great views of Tokyo skyline. Just can't say enough good things about this property. Highly recommend and look forward to returning sometime soon.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","sfguy24</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",79,5.0

Still, the service of the concierge in terms of sincerity and warmth was top notch.Finally, I want to say that I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo for two days prior to the Conrad; at the Conrad, for less money, I got a bigger room, with a better view, with one of the best service I've experienced.

If you get a room overlooking the harbour the view will be magnificent. This hotel was built in a grandiose way with super high ceiling gallery and modern and functional design. It delivers well on most front but the combination of a few lacks in service ( room not done in the pm or no one to help with luggage) and lack of charm prevents me for grading it like someof the other great of tokyo. Breakfast is abundant but nothing special like so many places without any touch of magic or love. But all is very professional.

We originally reserved a Twin Bay View Room, and since I had HHonors Diamond status, the hotel upgraded us to a Twin Bay Executive Suite without any hesitation. Although I had to physically call-in for the upgrade request to be processed, it was a pleasure to speak with the hotel staff. On the phone, all of them spoke excellent English and customer service was simply outstanding. This is a hotel that has been consistently ranked in the Top 5 for Best Hotels in Japan. You would not regret choosing this property. My family has stayed in dozens of Hilton-branded hotels in the past. From the Towers of Waldorf Astoria in New York City to Conrad Maldives, Conrad Tokyo is easily amongst one of our most favorite hotels. Breakfast was excellent, service was great, room was fabulous, gym was outstanding. Everything was carried out in perfection. This property is now my preferred hotel to stay at in Tokyo, both for leisure and business. If you want advises on sightseeing or to make a dining reservation, the concierge desk would be your friend. The highly dependable service can certainly be trusted. I had to get a new pair of glasses while I was in Tokyo, the concierge recommended a shop in Ginza, and I received my new glasses in less than 48 hours. They arrived in perfect conditions. I also shipped a mobile router to the hotel prior to my arrival, and when I arrived in my room, they were already on the desk waiting for me. As a highly experienced traveler, I greatly recommend this hotel to all types of visitors.

From there one can catch New Transit YuriKamome 1 stop to Shiodome (190Y JR pass not valid) but it is just as quick to walk along the level path which follows the course of the rail track. From Shiodome station follow the signs down an escalator and round the corner to hotel.Alternatively hotel is a 1400Y cab ride from Tokyo Station.Let me describe our experience. We arrived at the hotel at 1pm way too early to check-in (we thought) but at least we could leave our bags. Bags dropped at ground floor we were directed to the express lift to 28th floor reception. There the receptionist apologised for our room not being ready (why should it have been? we were 2 hours early) took our details, said she was upgrading us to executive club and took us to the 37th floor lounge. We had coffee and nibbles and had just started afternoon tea when we were told our room was ready and to our surprise and delight found ourselves in a suite on floor 36 overlooking Tokyo bay.The suite had a large sitting room, a large bedroom, a deluxe modern bathroom and every conceivable comfort. Best of all were the large picture windows with a view to the park below and out across the harbour, a great view by day and spectacular by night.As part of our package we had the option of dinner in one of three restaurants, we choose the Japanese which was first class, see review. Before dinner we went back to the lounge where drinks (soft drinks, quality wines or spirits were available) as well as delicious snacks.Breakfast the next morning was in the lounge with a wide choice of food and cooked to order omelettes. Check-out was at noon, but tempting as it was to linger in the hotel we wanted to see something of Tokyo so we checked out and left our bags on the ground floor before spending the day in Tokyo. We returned to collect our bags before starting our onward journey.So what was so special? In truth the whole package but especially the service. All staff were exceedingly courteous even to the extent of being greeted by a housekeeper in English. When asked for directions say to a different area of the hotel the member of staff walked you there rather than simply giving directions. The service in the lounge was unobtrusive but first class.The location worked well for us with easy access to JR lines and the views from the lounge and our room were stunning. When I booked the room I thought the cost was outrageous, but accepted that this was the going rate for a 5* Tokyo hotel, having experienced such luxury and service I now think it was remarkably good value.Others have described the hotel as world-class. I would not disagree.","Eastbourne, United Kingdom","Paul W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Eastbourne, United Kingdom</strong>",465,5.0

The view from city room view is gorgeous. The reception is very helpful. All in all it made my 5 night stay really good! The one exception I would say is the bar area. Every time I came for high tea, it was full and with reserved table empty! I was slightly frustrated! I read that there was a smoking section from other reviews, i dont mind it just as long as I am not sitting next to a big smoker! What I find is missing is just a regular bar area. There is something of that sort but it isn't like a normal bar with a barman that you can see them work. It would help have more seats available for solo travellers! I almost had a sense that they didn't want to give me a table that could seat two people. I felt badly which I don't like the feeling when I choose an hotel so carefully. I wanted the special for the tea and that too was sold out. So I was quite disappointed. I decided to have a drink!

This hotel did everything right. Before I even arrived, I was in constant contact with their concierges setting up airport pickup, dinners, spa appointments, and communication was friendly, helpful and super- easy. Pickup was without a hitch, check-in was so easy, warm and welcoming. The lobby is in a word, stunning. I was immediately put at ease and could not wait to see our room. I'd heard that hotel rooms in Tokyo were tiny like in NY, but ours was not. Our room was perfect. Sitting room/ living room, nice- sized bedroom, closet/ changing area and large extremely functional bathroom. Little things often bother me when I stay in hotel rooms when we travel... (not enough storage space or hooks, annoyingly large glowing alarm clocks, bright lights on smoke detectors on the ceiling, etc) but this room was so thoughtfully designed- plenty of hooks, super-flattering lighting, beautifully designed fixtures, plenty of storage, high end furniture and details.Service could not have been better. They were super- accommodating as we had to tweak our reservation, they actually had an available curling iron they loaned me for my stay (?!) The concierges were more than helpful- everyday as we requested our destination written out in japanese for taxi drivers, provided excellent advice while planning train travel, setting up dinners, setting up dinners in other cities after we left Tokyo. Most importantly, at certain times of day, concierge desks are mobbed- usually dinner time is the worst. At the Conrad, they have extra people working the desk and had floaters at the ready so no long wait times. Super- efficient. One team member I must mention was their amazing executive manager, Azwin Ferdauz/Ari. We had a package that was too fragile to hand- carry back home. He personally oversaw the packing and sending of our package and it was inexpensive to ship and beat me back to NYC!This is a fantastic property not far from the Ginza area. We went to see the other hotels we considered staying in on this trip... the Park Hyatt and the Ritz and honestly, The Conrad was the most modern, updated and stylish. It's not right in the center of everything- but then again everything in Tokyo is 20min in a taxi from everything else... it's a very spread-out city. Getting around was fast and easy. Beautiful bar/ lounge area (excellent sake-tinis!) extensive and delicious breakfast buffet, prompt and yummy room-service. EXCELLENT massages at the spa.Staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. Property was gorgeous. Would absolutely stay here again. (didn't want to leave!!)

We decided to upgrade our room to a suite on the executive level, our room was incredibly spacious fitted with everything you could ask for. Arriving late from Hong Kong we ordered room service (teriyaki chicken) that was tasty and prompt in arriving and more than enough for two people to share. We had breakfast downstairs at the main restaurant, there was a huge choice and you wouldn't get bored of the selection after a few days. However what made the trip memorable were the gracious, friendly and very helpful staff..especially Ari and Nanusa who were a delight to talk to and gave us great tips to help us make the most out of Tokyo during our short visit. The executive club lounge was also great, I loved the pre-dinner drinks and canapés or just sitting with a coffee and a chocolate whilst waiting to check out.

I am a Hilton Diamond member and I booked a regular room with a city view. When I checked in online I saw they had me in a suite with a bay view. I did not think too much about it assuming that it was a mdest room upgrade. When I arrived I discovered my room was a spacious two room king suite with living room, powder room, bedroom iwth large closets, and a huge bathroom with a walk in rain shower, soaking tub, separate toilet room, and double sinks. My room had a head on view of the bay that was lovely. It's clear I got an upgrade that was a couple of levels above my booked room level and this is well above what Hilton requires the Conrad to do for an upgrade. I was so grateful to have the lovely room that I ordered room service several times rather than going out for meals. The hotel gym is very nice they have extensive weights and an elliptical machine, a bike, and some treadmills. They also have a lap pool. It's hard to find a swimsuit in Japan if you are a larger American so bring your suit with you if you want to swim in the pool. I ate breakfast downstairs in the restaurant rather than the executive lounge. The food was good but not over the top like some other Conrad properties (I can not name them here because Tripadvisor will disqualify my post if I do). The executive lounge is modest size but very very nice. The lounge staff let me come back in the evening of the day I checked out, to sit for a few hours before my late night flight out of Haneda.

From the moment you arrive, it really is pure luxury. We were upgraded free of charge to a bay view which is much nicer than the city view, the city room view room is mainly two tall buildings directly in front of the room, still not bad but go for the bay view. Our room was huge, my daughter and I had two large twin beds. The bed are comfy with luxury linen, beautiful soft pillows, I loved the turn down service, where they place a little teddy in your bed with a fresh pressed night gown, which of course I wore every night. The bathroom was huge with a lovely stand alone bath and views out of a huge glass panel into the main room and out to the bay(don't worry you are able to shut the blind!). The toiletries in the bathroom are of excellent quality with everything from toothbrush to shower cap, body cream, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, hairbands, razors, nail files, hairdryer, literally everything you could ask for. Bedroom and bathroom is immaculately clean and faultless with a stocked mini bar which we did not use. The breakfast buffet was small and compact however there was everything you could ask for. We explained to the waiter that we were vegan (no meat, no dairy) and he prepared porridge with soya milk for us every day. On the last day he even remembered us and had the porridge already made for us and knew we were checking out today. I particularly liked the fruit section with fresh kiwi, pineapple, apple, melon, orange and grapefruit and other strange fruits i didn't know the name of cut up and displayed perfectly . I used the gym one night which was adequate and open 24 hours, an abundance of fresh towels, water, bananas and apples were there for you to take. The Jacuzzi was fantastic, they are single use jacuzzis and absolutely perfect for a short 5 minute blast, again the sauna and steam room is perfect with lovely high quality body washes . Be prepared to go naked, it didn't bother me but it may some people. The staff are very friendly and go out of your way to help and assist you. Thank you for an enjoyable stay.The only complaint is that the maid took my daughters pink blanket which was in the bedding, you must ask the maids to be careful as if a child loses something like a teddy or a blanket it could affect them the whole holiday. The only other thing which is not the hotel's fault is getting around, its so difficult to work your way around even getting to the train station from the hotel is so difficult even though its only a 2 minute walk under the subway. The closest train station is Shiodome but Shinbashi is a 5 minute walk through the subway system.","London, United Kingdom","joannehurley</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",213,5.0

I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to an executive level room with my HHonor status. The executive lounge was simply amazing. I had the opportunity to eat breakfast at the lounge all 5 days, afternoon tea for one of the days, and the evening reception for two nights. Each of the receptions were fantastic in its own way. I highly recommend you budget some time to relax at the lounge. The rooms themselves are extremely spacious with a fantastic couch near the window for lounging. The bathroom is ridiculously large, especially for a hotel in Japan. The spa/pool/gym on the 28th floor is simply amazing. Definitely the coolest swimming pool I've ever swam in. The gym is open 24 hours which is fantastic. In the locker room is a steam room, sauna, and four fantastic jet tubs that you can use to relax and unwind after a long day of exploring the city.

There were many more people than the last time we visited, and I believe it's for this reason that some issues with service and functionality arose. My family and I were guests during Christmas Holidays 2015, and I believe the hotel was fully booked. This caused quite a lag in the delivery of room service, as well as the suddenly slow and unreliable wifi service (last time we were there, it was lightning fast ). Most annoying however, was the constant presence of smokers at the bar directly across the lobby area where all guests must go through to enter and exit the hotel. For a strictly non-smoking family, this was a huge disappointment. The kids were exposed to it, as well as the asthmatics and there was really nothing we could do about it but hold our breaths as we hurried our pace to get it over and done with.When last we stayed, there would be a smoker or two but the ventilation easily purged away the smoke. This time, I guess, was just too much for the system to handle as revelers were jam-packed in the spacious bar with just slats to separate from the lobby.I do hope The Conrad addresses this; even if the issue is sporadic and wouldn't bother many other guests who aren't as particular about their environment being smoke-free as we are.

My google maps was glitching and I was basically just walking up to the front door of each building in a 1-2 block radius to see where the hotel was, since there were no obvious signs that I could see.

We loved Tokyo and The Conrad so much the first time that we decided to come for 3.5 weeks! After that amount of time you really get the true feeling of a city and of course, a hotel. Needless to say we are totally hooked! Japan is the best country on Earth and if you are lucky enough to get to Tokyo, I highly recommend staying at the Conrad. There are many reasons as to why but firstly the location is great. Directly above a metro station and 5 mins walk to the Shimbashi JR station, getting around is really easy. There are plenty restaurant options nearby. In general the food in japan is outstanding. From corner bakeries to Michelin restaurants we never had one bad meal. The Japanese take cleanliness really seriously, so you don't need to worry one bit about where or what you eat. Even 7/11's have delicious and fresh on the go meals. Secondly the service. It was amazing! The staff do whatever they can to make your stay more enjoyable. Check in was quick and efficient. We arrived really early and even though our room wasn't ready they gave us another room to rest in until our room was ready. We massively appreciated that after a 24 hour journey! The concierge team is superb. I've got to give a special thanks to Tomoko and Ryoko who took care of all our restaurant and show bookings and recommended fabulous sights and points of interests. The housekeeping staff kept our room spotless and the turn down service was consistent. Someone who made our stay extra special was Deepak. He went above and beyond for us and took the time to find out how we were enjoying our stay every couple of days. That meant a lot to us so thank you Deepak. Another shout out to Ari and Ayodo who were fantastic.The rooms are beautiful. Spacious and equipped with all the best technology. The beds are quite simply one of the most comfortable I have slept in. The curtains are total black out and not a sound can be heard from the hallways or neighbours. A good nights rest is guaranteed! The linen and towels are amazing. The only fault is the cupboard space which is pretty small especially for two people. The bathroom has a separate tub and shower and a double vanity. The breakfast spread was very good, many hot and cold options. A real treat is the view from breakfast room. In fact the views all around the hotel are amazing. Aesthetically the hotel in general is gorgeous, really well maintained and spotless. We miss Tokyo and The Conrad already and cannot wait to return. You won't go wrong with staying here I assure you!

I booked a King suite with bay view, and was not disappointed. What impressed me the most was that there were two toilets in the room, the main one in the bathroom, and another one in a small powder room situated next to the main door. The staff were efficient and quickly set up the room appointed to us, which includes my requests of an extra rollaway bed, (and as a HHonors member) some extra pillows, some adaptors and a humidifier. I caught a cold during my stay in Kyoto and wanted to see a doctor, and it was really awesome that a clinic was situated in Shiodome itself, the complex where Conrad is. In fact, getting to the clinic was just basically an elevator and escalator away! While located on the fringe of the main tourist area, most areas were accessible via the Shimbashi and Shiodome railway lines. Both stations are linked via an upper open air link way (which is really lovely to walk, weather permitting), or via the underground link way where restaurants and shops abound. Our room came with breakfast. On the first day or our breakfast, we noticed the absence of an egg station and we asked one of the staff where the egg station was. She came back with a menu where different egg dishes (and waffles) were listed but they were all priced separately. So we thought that these dishes would incur additional cost should we order them and thus we didnt. On the second day, once we were seated by the captain, he immediately informed us that the egg dishes on the menu were inclusive in our breakfast buffet and we were somewhat miffed that we werent informed of that on our first day. That said, special shout outs to two staff (we didnt get their names unfortunately) who made our stay seem more special: - the staff who came with a paper bag of stuff (extra amenities for the third person i the room) and set up the rollaway bed and humidifier. He was helpful, cheerful and efficient - the staff member who drove us to Royal Park Hotel to catch our shuttle bus to Narita Airport. He provided us with a bottle of water, accompanied us and our luggage every step of the way, making sure that our luggage were safely transferred, and that we were warmly ensconced in the van while waiting for the shuttle bus to arrive. Small things but on a freezing cold morning, these are truly appreciated.","Singapore, Singapore","Makml</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",10,5.0

Walking to Ginza takes about 10 minutes so it's not bad. The hotel occupies top 10 floor of the building and we stayed on 36th floor , in a suite with sweeping views of the bay, it's beautiful. The room itself is comfortable, bed is firm, large, and there is a separate living room area. It has a powder room for guests and also a walk in closet. The bathroom, however, was slightly disappointing. It's clean and neat, but not luxurious. No marble but with basic tiles. I guess this is really the only complaint. And of course I am comparing to other luxury hotels such as mandarin and peninsula ( which remains as my favorite in Tokyo) We had access in the lounge on 37th floor, funny it doesn't nice bay view but views of the city. Also it is way too small as each time I was there it was stuffy and full. (Breakfast, and early evening drinks) I think it needs to be at least double the size. We had breakfast here on 3 mornings and the omelettes were great!I also used the gym which was nice, the changing room has steam, sauna and a generous bathing area like a Japanese bath house with 4 individual jacuzzis. Concierge is also quite helpful in securing tough to get tables at restaurants. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would be returning in future.

We chose to stay in this hotel in Tokyo because we wanted strong service, particularly in helping us look into restaurants and other sights. I found the service lacking. Two examples as follows:First example:We checked in at 10 pm, and the concierge there spoke to us about a restaurant reservation we had made. We asked her about the tuna auction the next morning at Tsukiji Market. She recommended that we leave the hotel at 3:30 am. The next morning, bright and early at 3:30 am, we prepared to leave the hotel. We asked the staff in the lobby about directions to the market. He told us that his information (a printed sheet of paper that appeared to be for Conrad staff) showed that the market had been closed starting mid-Dec all the way until January. We were surprised because the concierge the night before hadn't told us it was canceled (and in fact gave us precise directions on time). He proceeded to double check the site, and informed us that indeed it was closed.We were disappointed to miss the auction, but also aggravated that we had gotten up at 3 am while being misinformed. I assume that the concierge staff should have known this given it is such an attractive tourist attraction, so near the hotel, and in fact the closure was for several weeks long. Second example:A member of the staff in the lobby asked if she could help us, so we asked her to help us confirm our restaurant reservation the next day. She had a lot of trouble communicating with us in English (a little strange - shouldn't they staff someone who has a better command of it to ask guests if they need help?). Finally she told us that the concierge was not here on Mondays and would be here at 7 am the next day. She also told us she would check on our restaurant reservation and would tell us upon check-out.We checked out several hours later. To our surprise, the front-desk staff told us the other staff member had left, and did not seem to have looked into the restaurant reservation. We had to wait for this new staff member to re-confirm our reservation, which made us nearly late for our lunch.I reached out to Conrad concierge to voice this complaint. I did receive a response back saying they are looking into it and apologizing for the confusion. At the end of the day, I expected better customer service and more professionalism.","San Francisco, California","Stephanie Kwong T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",122,3.0

We were especially impressed with the design and scale, including our room and the public areas especially the bar/lounge, China Blue restaurant, fitness/spa/pool and lobby/reception areas. Although the exec lounge quality and breadth of food and service were excellent, it seems to be too small of a space for the size of the hotel. The breakfast was outstanding as expected. Of particular note is the China Blue restaurant which although expensive, it was well worth it as the food is superb and unusual in a very good way! The hotel is located in what seems to be a central business area and is surrounded by other buildings and transportation network, so getting places is easy. It is located next door to a famous gardens, although we were not able to experience it as it was Jan. 1st and it was closed. Bay views are lovely which can be enjoyed from the bar/lounge and China Blue restaurants, but we had a room on the city side which was very comfortable but the views were nothing special. In contrast, we had also stayed at the Mandarin Oriental earlier in our trip where we could see Mt. Fuji at a distance from our room. We stayed on Hilton points which required 85K points which is very high but we were glad to have done so for the experience as it didn't disappoint.

It's an awful experience going through the lobby.The room is decidedly average, other than good shower pressure I wouldn't rave about anything.The breakfast is quite good and they serve the inclusive breakfast in the room, plus points for that.The location is ok, it's near Ginza (not walking distance), Shiodome, where the hotel is, is convenient for urban life but not necessarily for tourism. The club lounge offerings are boring. The alcohol selection is sub par. I like good whiskies good sake and shochu I drink most things. The vodka was absolute and the whisky was Johnny Walker Black. No single malts, no Japanese whisky, no Grey Goose/Belvedere, no Champagne, no decent wine. Not good enough for a five star hotel. Especially given how cheap alcohol is in Japan.The Consierge are not helpful, we asked for good sushi, they recommend Sushizanmai, which turns out to be a chain. We were looking for ""good"" sushi. I ended up going to Sushizanmai another night at 3 am when I discovered that another one of its branches is 24 hours. It's perfect at that time, but when we asked for good sushi at 1pm, I don't expect them to recommend a chain. Not that Sushizanmai is bad at all, my complaint is about the consierge's recommendation when we were looking for a fine dining experience. Another more serious complaint about the Consierge was when I requested to arrange to visit the Hakushu distillery. They could not tell me the price for a car with driver, they told me it's closed, which seemed unrealistic and strange, and when I asked for alternatives they were dumbfounded. This really spoilt my trip as visiting a Japanese Whisky distillery was one of the main things I wanted to do on this trip. It's worth nothing that when I enquired about a car with driver, the response was a ""whaaa very expensive"", which is very strange in a 5 star hotel. I was willing to pay, but clearly they weren't willing to check.A different day a member of my family asked about visiting Mount Fuji, and the consierge told them there's nothing to do there, again seems very unrealistic. They don't clean the rooms particularly well either.About the best the consierge could do was point out the nearest convince stores, anything beyond that seemed like too much work. Last time in Tokyo I was at the Park Hyatt, I don't know if it's deteriorated at all, but at that time it was a million times better than the Conrad is today. The reason I didn't pick the Park Hyatt again is because I prefer Central Tokyo, eg Ginza, Maranouchi, Shimbashi, Shiodome etc. to Shinjuku, which can be a bit rough and ready in comparison but given the quality of the Park Hyatt it's a fair trade off. Next time I will book the Andaz Toranamon or Mandarin Oriental. For anyone's first visit to Tokyo, make it the Park Hyatt for sure, it's not all talk it really is the experience you want and worth every penny. The other point to note is they are very stingy with upgrades. I am a HHonours Gold and even though rooms were available they didn't upgrade me.

The hotel is just quality from start to finish, but my gripe with all such hotels is they can be a little overly helpful at times. I am quite capable of making my own toast. They also wouldn't allow cigar smoking until after 9pm, in the smoking area, to respect people having Christmas dinner; but they would have been perfectly happy for me to smoke a pack of 20 cigarettes. Silly rule. Don't serve food in the smoking section if it's an issue, but I assume the diners chose that area because they were smokers themselves. A good selection of cigars though. In room dining choice was excellent and the hotel location is within easy walking distance of the Ginza shopping district and its subway line which takes you all the way to Shibuya district. Will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Tokyo.","Leeds, United Kingdom","Howler007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leeds, United Kingdom</strong>",13,5.0

Our king bedroom had a separate sitting area that could be closed off, a half bath in addition to the large bathroom and a large walk-in closet. The room faced Tokyo Bay and the beautiful Hamarikyu Garden. The room itself and the hallway were very quiet. The Lobby is on the 28th floor of the building making it necessary to use two elevators coming and going, which is a little inconvenient, but actually still feels more private and luxurious than the Peninsula. Many times an employee would see us walking to the elevator down from the lobby and press the button while asking if we would like to have a taxi called - nice touch. The gym is a nice size with sufficient machines and free weights and best of all is always open. The buffet breakfast was very nice and provided good variety during our 7 nights stay. The hotel is close to the Tsukiji Fish Market (soon to relocate and be replaced with Olympic Venues). It is also a short walk to Ginza and the Kabuki Theater.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not OCD. I just find it nice to be having the same habits I have at home--hence my last review for your hotel I mentioned ""like coming back home"".The following are the incidents during this one week stay with your hotel:1. On the third day of my stay, upon returning to the room I saw that the toiletries that I have arranged in a glass was partially ""spilled"" unto the basin area— two items were behind the basin, and one on the floor. It seemed like there was an accident, and the housekeeper left in a hurry.Also, the loungewear/pyjamas was placed in a diagonal fashion top on my worn, folded clothes on the drawer top in the closet— instead of putting it in the drawer or on the bed.2. On the fourth day of my stay, I went out before turn down service. Upon returning later in the evening, I realised that the used towels and one loungewear/pyjamas were collected but not replaced. I understand that there are usually four towels in a room, and two loungewear/pyjamas—and while i don't have a problem with two less towels in the room, i thought this is somewhat unusual.3. On the fifth day of my stay, upon returning after the day's sightseeing, I came back to the room seeing that the water bottles were not replenished. (Note: I highlighted to the front desk and it was sorted out.)But I have five bath towels in the room that night. And the lid to the box for the sanitary bag was not put on.4. On the sixth day, I came back to the room and saw the housekeeper's card in the card slot. I knocked and she allowed me INTO the room. This is a real shocker to me because during my previous stays, when this happened—the housekeeper would remove the card, and would ask me to use my own card to open the door. Security, right?Security is always a priority, and I think this shouldn't have happened anywhere. What if we are not the registered occupants to the room?5. Sanitary bag was not replaced on the sixth day during turn down service.6. Wash basin area and pedestal was noticeably dusty from second to fifth day.-----I do understand that this may be a very busy period for the hotel and the housekeepers; and I also understand the difficulties in maintaining a room, and that errors happens every now and then.Then again, some errors are just unacceptable, and should really be rectified.I do look forward to staying at Conrad again, and going 'home' once more.","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","chenyanlin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</strong>",0,4.0

Our rooms were well appointed, with very comfortable beds and large bathrooms with tubs and showers. The rooms included complementary tea and water, with a full mini-bar and in-room options. Wifi is also complimentary with average speed, though the upgrade option provided very good speeds.The executive lounge was well run with great full breakfast buffet options in the morning, including omelette and Japanese-style options.

You are a short walk to Ginza, a short taxi or Uber to Tokyo's main station, and the beautiful Hamarikyu Onshi Gardens are a 5 minute walk behind the hotel.Overall, I can easily recommend The Conrad to both business and vacation travelers looking for an excellent stay in Tokyo.","Bethesda, Maryland","SRHGreenville</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bethesda, Maryland</strong>",63,5.0

I made a last minute change in hotel and decided on the Conrad due to the trains and subways available at the station located under the hotel.This is probably still one of the best ""modern"" hotel that I've stayed in Japan. Everything about it is spot on. check in was painless and they even had a guest relations officer greet my son and I to find out if there was anything else we needed. Well I needed 2 tickets to the car show, and the ticket machines at the 711 were hard to understand and I also wanted to eat at a specific restaurant that night. She immediately took care of it, and 10 minutes later in the room all was set.The room and view was perfect, Tokyo bay out the window, cant ask for more. The controls for the lights, blinds, curtain A/C etc. were all analogue buttons/knobs and easy to understand, this is something a lot of modern hotels don't get right. Most hotels, try to go high tech with touch screen controls, and preprogramed light settings, without realizing there is a learning curve that travelers sometimes have no time to deal with. Also touch panels don't work well with wet fingers, and have a 1 to 1.5 second delay between entering the command and execution. What caught be by surprise was the use of a motion sensor to activate the lights in the closet, instead of a door switch, which means if works flawlessly with none of the alignment problems.At night during turn down service they leave complimentary Conrad pajama tops for you to use on your bed, and the right size I may add. Hmm, that's a first.The best part of the room was the armoire/mini bar with its whisky box, stocked with some of the best out there.If you want a no nonsense hotel, great instant service, and a room where everything works well this is the place.","Manila, Philippines","jinx d</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",16,5.0

The rooms are as modern as you will find with every luxury you would want from a western style hotel. The views from the lobby on the 28th floor of Tokyo Bay are gorgeous. Every restaurant was top notch, you can't go wrong from the most casual of food at the lobby bar 28 all the way up to China Blue there fine dining spot. The service was wonderful as the hotel and it is centrally located in the city about 2 blocks from the Ginza shopping district.

Nice smell, very comfy bed, and quiet.The executive lounge was bijou in size, and perhaps a little full on one evening, but it had uber-efficient staff hurrying platefuls of canapes to guests who didn't even know they needed them. Ice-cream, cakes and a (small) selection of Japanese snacks complete the afternoon tea and evening service. No booze during teatime, but a somewhat economy selection available in the evening. Breakfast was good, with more tasty Japanese items in addition to a western breakfast with an in-lounge, live-but-grumpy Mr Chef turning out super-fluffy omelettes better than a French one could.The only gripe I have is that the main bar on the reception floor (34th or so floor, how nice!) was poorly served. After a loooong wait someone eventually came to us, then another looong wait, and we get a pretty good cocktail, marred by billowing clouds of smoke. Smoking area was choking off half of the big and long bar. We asked if we could move, ""sure I will come back when we have another table"" and no one came back even to say ""still busy"" (it was not too much) during the 45 minutes we stayed there.

We have done about all of the rest, from the Waldorf Astoria line, on down - but the first in the Conrad Group.We booked a ""Jr Suite,"" with HHonors points, and my first interaction was with the Concierge staff.We are very discerning diners, and wife has one food allergy (Bi-valves, so no Scallops, Oysters, Clams or Mussels), and I made our schedule and desires clear. The Concierge was excellent, and did all of the ""heavy lifting"" for us, giving me great descriptions of all of the options, for the nights available. I could not have asked for better service, or a better understanding of what we were looking for, including that one allergy. Absolutely great!As we had booked a pickup from NRT, that was our first physical encounter, and it was very good - everything just as outlined. Now, the only slightly downside of the entire stay was the road construction all around the hotel, and even our driver had a bit of an issue getting us to the front door (though he had been there just the week before - things had changed).Check-in was flawless, and we were given a complementary upgrade to a full suite. Remember, I booked with HHonors points!The suite was spacious, lovely, and the amenities were excellent, as was the view of Hamariku Gardens below. Other than having to explore the lovely shower's controls a bit, plus find where all the light controls were (should have asked our host), we were greatly impressed. At this point, I need to step back a bit. We have had the pleasure to stay at several Michelin 5-star hotels/resorts, plus some fabulous inns. The full suite at the Conrad Tokyo, gave them all a run for the money. Even doing the math (what that room ran with money, and not points plus an upgrade), the value was about as good as it gets, including many ""Presidential Suites"" around the world.All of the staff of the hotel were excellent, accommodating, friendly, professional and extremely helpful. We wanted nothing.After the trip, we reflected on the choices and reservations for the restaurants, including notice to each and all, of wife's allergy, and could not have asked for anything different. So nice to work with such a professional, and expert Concierge staff. They are the best!We visited the Penninsula Tokyo, the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo and the Ana Intercontinental, and none offered more, than what we encountered, in general terms.For us, loving to walk a bit, and to explore, the location was great, and when all of the street construction is done, I would deem it perfect, unless someone had a very specific location need.We are looking to go back to Tokyo, just to stay at the Conrad Tokyo again - it was THAT good.Photos to follow.","Phoenix, Arizona","The_Loup_Garou</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",2115,5.0

In fact, the highlight of our trip was a Sumo practice we were able to attend that was arranged by the concierge with a former Sumo wrestler serving as the tour guide.The Exec Lounge was great with a nice breakfast, snacks and happy hour. The pool on the 29th floor, overlooking the city, was great. The sleeping rooms are larger than average with nice amenities. We enjoyed the city view – I don’t think the bay view is worth the extra $$ as you can get that same view from the Reception lounge, though smoky (see note below).The hotel location was good for us. You’re walking distance to a park where you can pick up the water taxi. It’s also walking distance to the morning fish market. There are lots of easy public transportation options nearby.Cons – You check in on the 28th floor and the reception is open plan with a connecting bar overlooking the city. The bar is smoking, so you’re greeted with the strong smell of smoke immediately upon exciting the elevator. Also, the Executive Lounge claims a no mobile phone use policy, but does not enforce – we had to listen to a family do facetime for 30+ minutes during the cocktail reception. Not cool. Also, as a family traveling with children we did allow our children into the lounge during the day but made sure they were well behaved. I was surprised at the number of people in there with babies – late at night – and noisily with rattles, screaming, etc. I believe there should be a no kids policy at certain times of the day (i.e., after 8 pm). And the lounge attendants should enforce the no mobile phone policy for all.Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. You pay for the privilege of staying here, but our family, the price tag was worth it.","Singapore, Singapore","SLDSanFrancisco_CA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",112,5.0

From the marvelous breakfast buffet to the Japanese specialities restaurant, the foods and their presentations are very appealing. The guest rooms are spacious, well appointed and have numerous grace notes. [To an American like me, the self-sanitizing, heated toilet seat with its water rushing sound was interesting and instructive of the Japanese ideas about privacy and luxury.] The push button shades and draperies, etc held the theme of one's room being a tiny castle. The staff could not have been more gracious, solicitous or well-informed. From suggestions for activities to arranging transport and museum directions, they were great.It is easy to get the airport shuttle to the hotel before 8pm.

It was very hard and first two nights my wife and I slept very poorly. When I enquires if we could switch rooms to a softer bed, was told apparently they are all the same. I think they must get this question often as they offered to add some blankets to the top to soften it a bit.

Location is in a quieter area than Shinjuku or Tokyo Station, however there are plenty of food places to eat at nearby. After a few days, we actually preferred this area since when you experience the amount of people traffic whom use the Tokyo metro system, you appreciate being somewhere which is quiet especially on a weekend. Btw, it is only 5mins walk to the Shiodome metro station or 10mins walk to Shimbashi station (larger station, basement food/shops to explore, great ramen place) which has the metro & JR line (can be accessed via underground walkways no need to worry about the rain).Stayed for a total of 5 nights split 2/3 since we also travelled to Osaka in-between.Booked a standard city view room on both occasions which was a great size with a full room length chaise long to lounge on.Was upgraded to a bay view room on the second occasion which has the same room size & format albeit, a slightly better view outside.Breakfast was of good quality & adequate mix of Japanese & Western fare.The staff at the Conrad are very much an international team with all speaking good English.

There is this big long sofa by the window, really nice to laze around and take in the Tokyo bay.

The only part which stopped me from giving full marks is the location, while the good part is you can walk to Tsukiji market from the hotel, the not so good part is its not near any mall and the station closest is not one of the key stations, a small disadvantage but if you can walk its about 15 mins from a key station and 1,000yen to grab a cab to Ginza.","Singapore, Singapore","wee han c</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",20,4.0

We were arriving from the Roppongi area and finding the hotel from underground was easy. Location wise, we found the Conrad excellent for getting to different parts of the city, especially Ginza and Odaiba (the hotel is right next to the Yurikamome line as well). Also, it is very convenient to get to Haneda from here).Although we only had one night, we were happy with our stay. We were given a large suite-like room with two queens which was more than adequate and extremely comfortable. The room was clean, modern and overlooking the city.We did not get the chance to dine in the hotel or partake in the facilities but the lobby lounge looked very nice (though smoking allowed it seems). The little interaction we had with staff was efficient and friendly and they answered all of our questions.

Admittedly we had kids with us so we could not explore the urban landscape as much as we wanted but we didn't find ginza to be all that exciting. Shinjuku had their alleyways full of unique local restaurants and shopping and is only a few stations away by train to harajuku, omotesando and shibuya. Ginza felt like orchard road in Singapore, big buildings and big luxury brands. Except for the Ginza Hakuhinkan Toy Store (http://www.hakuhinkan.co.jp/guide_en.html, which apparently also has a branch in Shinjuku), a 15 minute walk from the hotel, we can't find any particular reason to revisit ginza.Odaiba is nearby but we did not get a chance to visit.Service was great, as Conrad's are known for. We asked the concierge for suggestions for quiet spots for sakura viewing and was recommended a place close to his house. It was the height of sakura season, and there was practically no one walking along the river lined with sakura trees! amazing.The hotel had no kids club (understandable since it's a business hotel) but it would have been nice to have. We are used to going to bali where practically every hotel has a kid's club.Convenience store is located in the same building, exit the hotel and go down one level via escalator. Train station to (I believe) odaiba is right next to the hotel, also to shinjuku or shibuya (if memory serves). The bigger train station with more connections is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel.Look for rooms facing the bay.

There is an admittedly large and well lit bathroom mirror, but to access that is likely to mean encountering a wet floor from the shower, so not ideal when barefooted or wearing socks while getting ready. There is a mirror opposite the wardrobe but the passageway is narrow so it is difficult to get a view from any distance to check how your whole outfit looks.

What can I say! Let's begin with the level of service. Every employee takes great pride in what they do and this is made evident by the great level of service they provide. It is amazing how much pride everyone takes in their job and how they go the extra mile to make sure you feel at home. You can sense that this is something that runs deep in Japanese culture and is truly reflected at this hotel. Will be hard to stay at a US hotel from now on after experiencing this level of service at the Conrad Tokyo. Facility - impeccably clean, as is most of Tokyo. Might seem insignificant, but the hotel lobby and hallways smell amazing!!! We asked and it is a fragrance made of lavender, green tea, and orange. Didn't get to use the pool, spa, or gym facilities, but everything else we experienced was great. Room - our room was a standard king-bed suite facing the city. Room was spacious and even accommodated a rollaway bed. We were on the 37th floor facing the city. Room had everything you would expect from a hotel such as the Conrad. Executive Lounge - did enjoy staying on the 37th floor and having access to the executive lounge. The lounge is open early in the morning until evening. We were able to have complimentary breakfast and had access to snacks all day, plus beer and wine in the evening. It was definitely a nice perk. Omelette selection included salmon, brie, asparagus, and much more - delicious! Location - given my limited knowledge of the city, we felt that the hotel was in a very good location. First of all, it is about two blocks from Tokyo's famous fish market (our guide did mention that the market will be relocated to a different part of Tokyo given that it needs serious remodeling. But for now, you can walk to it from the Conrad. One side of the hotel faces the beautiful Hamarikyu Gardens and Tokyo Bay. The building itself is part of the Shidome area and train station. This means that you are surrounded by office buildings, shops, coffee shops, and walking distance to the Shidome subway station. Very convenient!! Wifi- had free wifi, but not sure if this is because of my diamond status or every guest enjoys free wifi. Wifi was much faster than what I usually experience in US hotels. As you can tell, greatly enjoyed staying at the Conrad Tokyo and would consider staying here when we visit Tokyo again.","Brownsville, Texas","fernandopp_13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brownsville, Texas</strong>",26,5.0

My tip is you change station in Daimon, hop on the Oedo Line and alight at the Shiodome station. This is much easier and luggage friendly instead of alighting at the Shimbashi station.I grabbed a great Black Friday deal on a 3rd party site for our stay here. I booked the King room with City view with breakfast.I advice the hotel regarding our stay and we are celebrating our anniversary. I tried to get a complimentary upgrade to bay view during check-in. However, they did not budge even if there is availability during our stay (they tried upselling the room). Although they sent us a complimentary cake which was very much appreciated.Our room was fantastic and I must say that one of the biggest non-suite room that I have stayed in (it was even bigger to standard size suites in other comparable 5 star hotels). The view was not to scoff about and it showed a very busy cityscape.Turndown service is as expected from the Conrad brand with the cute teddy bears that my girlfriend collects. The hotel went the extra mile by providing my girlfriend the whole set of the teddy bears as souvenir. The bathroom is very big and the heated toilet is welcome from the cold weather. They use Aromatheraphy as default but you can request Shanghai Tang and Tara Smith brand if you prefer.The concierge and the front desk staff had great command of the area and was really good in suggesting the correct walking routes and train stations that we need to take during our stay. With their direction, we were able to walk comfortably to Tsukiji market and Ginza area.The breakfast Cerise was fantastic and we enjoyed the Conrad signatures such as the Eggs Benedict and Huevos Rancheros ( must try). The service was efficient and it was not crowded from 7am-8am. The sushi was fresh and delicious.Even if it was 5 degrees outside, we were able to enjoy swimming in their indoor pool. The pool access is free for all guests of Conrad ( I even asked this question before staying). Also, they have sauna I think in the locker rooms. Although, we did not try this facility. They can also provide with you with swimwear if you need ( not sure if this is free).The not too perfect part was our checkout when the we called for assistance for our bags. They never came. So we just lug our luggage on our own. Although, the concierge was very apologetic.We'll definitely consider staying here again if the prices and dates are right.","Manila, Philippines","Jambert D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",30,4.0

This Conrad hotel is not very far from the Hakone Airport. A lift with a Taxi could be quite affordable - but I didn't do it in the 2 times I stayed in this lovely hotel. The entrance to the hotel is rather vague, mostly due to the construction that is going on in front of the hotel. A warm welcome from the staff from the first floor, but you actually have to get up to the 28th floor to check in, which is not too much of a hassle. Using the very very fast elevators that let you get to the lobby, you are greeted with people who speak perfect English. I had no trouble of getting a room in light-speed and grace. The room I stayed was a just a room (suprerior? deluxe?). The size was not that smaller compared to the room I had a year ago (which was a junior suite). I loved how cleverly the bathroom was oriented, and also how I could have the blinds down and up, to reveal (or cover) as much as I want of the activities in the bathroom.You are given the choice of amenities from Aromatherapy to Shanghai-Tang. Breakfast was on the club lounge, the lack of space and menu is recovered by the good service and the quality of the food. I was a little disappointed that they charged you extra, for the 'signature egg menus (e.g. Egg benedict, and other fancy egg dishes - which was complimentary before) The room was what you would expect from an excellent hotel. Spacious. Comfortable bed, good lighting, magnificent view, cleanliness, useful stuff all filled in neatly and conveniently into the space. I really could not ask for more.And to top it off the crew of the hotel was very kind and helpful, and knew and understood what you wanted right away, even if their English fell a little short. I definitely would love to stay here again and again.On the downsideWe rented a car and parked it in the hotel. In that case, most hotels would let you park your car complimentary. We had to pay 3,000 yen/night for parking. A little dissappointment which takes out one star from this hotel.","Jeju Island, South Korea","joonimooni</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jeju Island, South Korea</strong>",33,4.0

Tokyo is an absolutely stunning and beautiful city, but rather busy and at times chaotic. This hotel takes all of that away. The bar makes you feel like you're in a movie ( lost in translation, to be exact!) and the pool is out of this world. Swimming 30 stories high and enjoying the views, at any time of day, is simply magical. The rooms as also excellent, elegant, and spacious. The bathrooms are very large and spacious, offering both a tub and a shower, and the toilet and shower are separated from the rest of the bathroom. The rooms are also very comfortable, with excellent views of Tokyo and ample space. Breakfast is very good, and we ordered room service while we were there, and the eggs and pancakes were excellent. If you're looking for an alternative, there is a Starbuck right outside of the hotel. The hotel is situated 2-3 minutes walk from the metro/train stations, and you could literally go anywhere from there. It's also fairly easy to reach from Narita airport, it's only one connection. Beware to travelers! Narita is basically in the middle of nowhere, so it takes about 1-2 hours to get to the hotel from the airport, but if you take the right trains you only need to change once. There are also several good restaurants around there. The taxis are not too expensive, so getting to a restaurant is easy. I would recommend Heiroku Sushi, which is a bit further away (10 minutes taxi) but really quite good, as well as the Robataya restaurant, which is rather expensive but definitely worth the experience if you're willing to pay the extra price. It's good for couples and families, and the kids will definitely enjoy it. If you do go to Heiroku Sushi in Omotesando, there is a dessert place right across the street called Max Brenner -- definitely worth it! I would recommend a walk through the Ginza area, which reminds you of fifth avenue, as well as Omotesando. I liked Omotesando more, and it's especially nice at night. The hotel concierge was excellent while we were there, so you shouldn't have any problems finding somewhere to eat or something to see! I would suggest a minimum stay of 3 full days in Tokyo to get to see everything, and 5 would be the ideal number for me.","Milan, Italy","vossari</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milan, Italy</strong>",27,5.0

In my previous visits to Tokyo I had stayed at Shibuya. There are pros and cons to staying at Shimbashi area. Personally I really liked Conrad Tokyo's location for its proximity to Tsukiji and Ginza (both within walking distance) and other places of interest such as Akihabara, Ueno Park and Tokyo Imperial Palace. The hotel is easily accessible and well connected to the transport system. The Oedo station (subway) and Shiodome station (Yurikamome) are situated just beside the hotel's entrance. The nearby Hamarikyu gardens is a hidden gem and great for taking photos of the cherry blossoms during the Sakura season (hint to photographers).The rooms and views of the bay area were without a doubt the highlights of Conrad Tokyo. The rooms were generously sized for a hotel in Tokyo with an understated modern luxurious appeal. The RH suite in particular was the most impressive room I had seen and it is hard to be impressed by other hotel rooms after this experience. The shower pressure was simply divine and felt like going to a massage everytime, very therapeutic and relaxing. I was however slighltly letdown by the lack of electrical outlets near the bed. The indoor heated pool was another one of my favourite things about the hotel. The 25m pool was a good size for those who demand a serious workout and was never crowded whenever I was there.Service standards throughout my stay was generally good and efficient but nothing memorable. For some reason, the frontdesk was always busy and always had a queue. Breakfast at the lounge was decent and even better at the restaurant with a larger buffet variety. I had dined at China Blue and Kazahana as part of the stay package. Food at the China Blue was very good but somewhat disappointing at Kazahana as I was expecting the same quality and flair as a Kaiseki served at a high end Ryokan. Foodies would get more satisfaction and value from the Tsukiji restaurants nearby (while it last). Afterall the proximity to Tsukiji market in itself is a reason for staying at Conrad Tokyo!Notwithstanding its flaws, Conrad Tokyo ranks among the best five star hotel that I have stayed. I would definitely return in a heartbeat. (I'm hoping the Tsukiji market will be there the next time I return.)",,Ying Tat W,31,5.0

We have stayed at the Four Seasons, The Park Hyatt, the Mandarin Oriental, etc., but had never tried the Conrad Tokyo. Having just stayed there, I can assure you that our search for the perfect Tokyo hotel is over: the Conrad Tokyo is IT. The rooms are extremely spacious and what is more, the space within them is well thought out. There is an upholstered bench seating that spans the length of the entire room; we laid our suitcases out open from end to end on this bench and if you have ever had to dress from a suitcase on the floor, or stuck in a too small closet on a flimsy luggage rack, you will know what a luxury it is to have such an arrangement. The bathroom is fantastic. A double sink, large, excellent shower, separate WC and a lovely free-standing ""egg"" shaped tub in plenty of room for two people to use at the same time. My only complaint about the room is that the bed is a little too hard (but I find this to be the case in most Japanese hotels). It is still quite comfortable. The attention from the staff is unbelievable. We had our room serviced constantly, silently, swiftly. We do not know how this was done; we were in and out of that room all the time, showering, changing, dropping off packages, etc., yet each time we returned, the room had been serviced. The staff at this hotel are tremendous. We had several requests that I think were very demanding of us, yet the staff at the Conrad Tokyo were so helpful and efficient that they were able to accomplish all of our wishes which included car service from Narita, a two hour viewing of Sumo practice and a reservation for 4 at Jiro Sukiyabashi Ginza and a reservation at Birdland for 6. Virtually impossible requests, done apparently effortlessly!The breakfast buffet is absolutely first rate. There are a great variety of foods, both Western and Eastern and everything is completely delicious. We broke a family rule and one night had dinner at the hotel restaurant (instead of going out), and found the dinner to be as delicious as the breakfast. The staff is fantastic and gracious. Topping the list of them is Ari who makes coming back to the hotel everyday a complete delight. His warm and caring personality completely captivated our family, especially our children who remain totally smitten with him. And he goes above and beyond any expectations. One evening we were having drinks in the (very beautiful) bar across from reception and we spotted him and waved him over. We told him we were planning to go to a salon the next day where little fish eat away at the dead skin on your feet. (a very Japanese experience!). That is all we said about it; just chatted about other adventures we were planning. He excused himself eventually and before we got up to leave the bar, he was back with a map of the salon we should visit, with the name of the salon and their hours!!! As well, after we checked out of the hotel and went to Shanghai, my cell phone was stolen as I got off the plane. As I knew I was going back to Tokyo for a night before my flight back to the States, I wrote Ari care of the hotel to help me find a cell phone I could rent while in Japan. He was forwarded the email by the hotel staff and he wrote me back immediately. Ari exemplifies the spirit and kindness that every employer is looking for in a team member. He is a lovely human being and a bright and shining star in the lovely crown of the Conrad Tokyo. The hotel is located walking distance to the Ginza (and even from Tokyo Station if you like a longer stroll). The WiFi was excellent.

The Conrad found me a guide service for more in-depth tourism on the week-end.While Asian hotels in general have a superior reputation for service, the Conrad shines with both friendly and efficient support, providing information and services that truly met my needs. Staff are nicely attentive but never invasive. My room on the executive floor was spacious and well equipped. The hotel has a vast array of in-house amenities including restaurants, gym, spa etc. that I rarely used as I wanted to see Tokyo.

The King Suite had a separate lounge and bedroom, open-plan bathroom (with separate shower/bath and also two WC areas) and a walk-in dressing area that connected to the room's entrance. Electric blinds and curtains came down to ensure you could completely black-out the room for a peaceful night slept.The hotel is located conveniently next to the Shiodome complex (which has a metro that connects to Haneda) and Shinbashi Station as well as the Tsukiji Fish Market.

From the emails to the staff prior to check-in to the help on luggage storage afterwards, most everything was seamless and very enjoyable. We were in a King Suite with a bay view, and there were many thoughtful touches.First, the hotel accommodated us with our two kids -- with one in the crib and the other in the same bed as us. Even if we had wished to, the suite wouldn't have fit a rollaway bed. That said, the room still felt spacious and comfortable. We also received a nice amenity due to our anniversary, and they gave us Conrad bears as well. The shower/tub combination was nice, and a big hit with our toddler, who loved taking baths there.Location-wise, it is very close to the fish market (for now), and it's proximity to Shiodome and the JR station makes it convenient (though the walk to the latter is not a short one). My absolute favorite thing, though, is the shower pressure. It is very strong!The only negatives I'd have to share include: the bed was surprisingly not that comfortable; and while there was super enthusiastic and service-oriented folks, like Ari (believe he's a manager of some sort), the staff can feel rigid and cold, so compared to other top hotels in Tokyo (such as the Park Hyatt), it falls short.Overall, we really liked this hotel, and you will too if you're looking for something that delivers the Conrad experience.","Arcadia, California","dagongster</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arcadia, California</strong>",93,4.0

Stayed five nights during cherry blossom season and wish I could've stayed longer. Pros:- location location location.

Courteous, helpful, and thoroughly engaging, we loved all the staff we met, including Ari, Pinter, and Yuka. Conversations that went beyond the typical niceties coupled with staff members always being attentive to my pregnant wife were just a few memories that will bring us back to the Conrad the next time we're in town. - room was enormous. Now we had just arrived from Kyoto and its cubicle sized hotel rooms, but these rooms where big for western standards and had all the luxurious amenities that come with a Conrad property. Cons: very few and minor - no coffee machine in the room- wifi access was hit or miss, but staff was helpful to find stop gap solutions. - menu in the main casual restaurant could be expanded to offer more Japanese items. All in all, a great stay and will definitely stay again. ","Singapore, Singapore","sakhan00</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",16,5.0

From Haneda airport, we took the Keikyu line and hopped off the Shiodome station. It's a 10min walk from there. There is a mall underneath the hotel where there are various resto like McDonald's, Starbucks, Din Tai Fung, and Family Mart. But this is a good 5 to 7 minute walk from the main entrance of the hotel. Just the same- meets my first requirement of the hotel being near a mini mart and lots of food choices. Conrad's main reception is at the 28th floor. But they have a concierge desk at the first floor whose personnel is more than willing to assist their guest up the lift. On the 28th floor, checking in was a breeze. The only glitch was I chose the 34th floor via their internet check-in, but it was not recorded in their system. So settled for the 31st floor. The good thing about being in the lower floors, the trip up and down the lift is much faster.The basic room is huge as compared to Tokyo standards. I love the glass bathroom which is a signature feature of Conrad. Since the bathroom is elevated, expect your steps to echo a bit. But all around, the room screams class which is expected from Conrad. I requested for firm pillows and was given Tempur pillows to sleep on. Amazing.We had breakfast at the coffee shop. The view is amazing but the seating capacity is limited. If it's full, you will be requested to move to another resto nearby but the buffet spread will be different. The staff are attentive and you can see their eagerness to serve. Of course - excellence comes with a price.

As the building is modern, don;t come expecting traditional charms, the hotel appeals to those with a modern taste and who like contemporary design with expansive views out over Tokyo Bay or back towards the city itself.I had a bay view room which was very spacious and roomy (By far the biggest room I saw in Japan in a city where space it at a massive premium). Bathroom was clean and crisp with all the modern facilities. Bed mattress was on the hard side but far from uncomfortable and I found the combination of the blinds and room heating meant my stay was warm and comfortable.I used both the restaurants and room service at different points during my stay. Room service was very speedy, the food came in half the time that they initially said. It was piping hot and great quality. Breakfast is a buffet but you can also order from a cooked menu too. The food itself was perfectly adequate and came very quickly. They do have a slightly strange policy of guiding you to a table, once despite there being eleven tables free and only two being used in one area of the restaurant I was escorted to a far corner table in a totally different part of the restaurant, rather hard to understand but just go with the flow.All in all expect to be very comfortable at Conrad Tokyo and the room size and feeling of space are really what set the hotel apart from the competition in my view.

I didn't enjoy the jacuzzi though, they were a bit claustrophobic and not very clean. One area of improvement I see is the bar.

To get to the point (as it was for me when looking for hotels in this part of Tokyo), the hotel is connected basically to Ginza by a series of recently built, glass walled (but open-air) elevated walkways. At a leisurely pace maybe 10 minutes to Ginza. The last 100 feet arriving in Ginza is blocked off for construction so you have to take a detour to a less desirable (but safe) iron walkway down to the ground but I believe it will be gone soon.Okay, now to the hotel: It occupies the top of a 37 story building. It has a separate entrance on the ground level but the lobby is on the 27th floor. I don't usually like these kinds of entrances because it means taking ""two"" elevators up to your room (cp. to the Park Hyatt Tokyo etc.) but the foot traffic has been meager so you don't really feel too inconvenienced.I stayed in a bay view suite and it was very peaceful. The room is very well appointed with modern, minimalist decor.There is an executive lounge on the 37th floor which offers the usual amenities throughout the day, and is warmly appointed with staff to help you with your stay. It was not a very large lounge however so I never partook of the breakfast offered there because there is a breakfast buffet at the lobby level at the restaurant called Cerise.During my stay I also ate at their Japanese restaurant. The service was very good at the restaurant but it was odd that they had no sushi offerings. There was a sushi bar area but it was unstaffed, so maybe it is being retooled or just off that day (Monday)?There were lots of families. I would say during breakfast as an example, over 50% of the tables were families with children. But you rarely see them or run in to them in the hotel. I believe it is because it was April and holiday time for many regional expats deciding to visit Tokyo. Lastly, there is a small arcade of restaurants and a starbucks in the basement, both in the adjacent office building.","Atherton, California","MillionsRoadWarrior</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atherton, California</strong>",29,5.0

We were ""given"" a paid upgrade to a bay view suite (the odd numbers are bay view, even numbers are ""city"" view, but really look at taller buildings across the street). The upgrade was less than $100/night, we had booked the hotel using points, so it was a steal, and the view was spectacular. The bathrooms have wet rooms with a great shower head coming out of the ceiling, and a large round lighted mirror. I also was in a room with a king bed, and it was quite spacious. The staff will do anything to make your stay pleasant. The breakfast, snacks, and evening drinks in the Executive Lounge are all great with fantastic staff to take care of anything you need. I used the gym, which is quite reasonable, and the spa, which has private bathtubs for a good soak. The hotel is at the Shiodome metro stop, which is on a loop that goes to Shinjuku and Shibuya (two places tourists like to go). The hotel is walking distance to Ginza and easy to get to other neighborhoods in Tokyo by metro or taxi. When we returned to Tokyo we had booked in a ryokan, but when we arrived the room was maybe 9 x 7..just enough room for two futons on the floor. I loved the idea of a ryokan, but there wasn't even room for our luggage. I got online and found that The Conrad had rooms, booked using points, and when we arrived were given a complimentary upgrade to a bay view corner suite, which was larger than the first suite, and about 10 times larger than the room we had just left. THIS was the way to end a fabulous trip to Japan...in a corner suite overlooking Tokyo Bay with attentive staff doing everything they can to make your last couple of days in Tokyo memorable. I had never stayed at a Conrad before this, but will certainly look for them when I travel in the future due to a very positive experience at the Tokyo Conrad.","Los Angeles, California","travelingangeleno</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",34,5.0

Ari on the Concierge Team greatly exceeded our expectations - he couldn't do enough for us, he remembered several days after making dining recommendations to ask how we enjoyed that restaurant and his service skills are impeccable.

We decided to burn some Frequent Flyer points and stay at the Conrad because of its good reputation (and the points deal was good too). Our room was ready at normal check-in time, and check-in was a breeze. We had a regular suite overlooking the Gardens and the Rainbow Bridge. The suite itself was well appointed with 1.5 bathrooms and a nice tub (with the usual ugly Conrad duck, no offense)/shower combo. Double vanities were well maintained and looked good with all the standard amenities.The downside was that the furniture was a little worn. The chair and the couch were a little stained and they did not look too inviting. On the upside the walk-in closet was great, and the bed was very comfortable. We missed a electronic control panel for the blinds, etc. - you had to get out of bed to control them by the window, which we found a little odd as most hotels of this standard has some sort of electronic controls. I found the air conditioner to be a little noisy and I ended up turning it off during the night.The facilities on premises are great. A wide choice of restaurants (Cerise restaurant was suprisingly good, albeit not so lively) - as we only stayed for one night we did not get to try the other ones. The bar looked nice, but I disliked the smoking there.As we were leaving for the airport the next day, I wanted to inquire about transfer service to the airport. Approaching the concierge desk they didn't seem to understand me at first, and seeing as I was wearing an overcoat I think they may have thought I was not a guest of the hotel? We did end up reserving a transfer for the next day which went rather smoothly. Checkout was easy and we were helped with our luggage. The transfer to the airport was easy as the airport bus takes you straight to your terminal.The breakfast in the morning was great (and included in our room rate), and the service was again spotless.The location of the hotel is great. Direct access to Shimbashi station. It is a business area, but a 15 minute walk to Ginza and easy access to the metro station. Taxies are outside too, and we did use them once in a while. Maybe we were just unlucky, but the two taxies we took to the hotel did not know where it was located, so we had to try and guide them there (we did have the name in Japanese as well as the address). I expect this is because the Shimbashi area is fairly new.Overall the stay was great, but the rooms (that do have an amazing view if you choose the Bay side rooms) were a little worn and the service had a slight hiccup.",Copenhagen,"Daniel G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Copenhagen</strong>",12,4.0

After running a check on all the conference hotels, I chose Conrad Tokyo. While reading materials on tourism in Japan, I got to know that acquiring a sim card in Japan and using it in an unlocked phone is more expensive than renting a phone. Before my departure, I rented a phone from Advanced Global Communications which among others, gave unlimited internet access. The phone company sent me the number of phone before my departure and assured me that the phone package would be sent to Conrad before my arrival. On arrival in Conrad, the package was waiting in my room. After one week of using the phone, I concluded that the cost was reasonable.On arrival at Narita airport, I and a colleague seamlessly purchased a bus ticket which made runs to Conrad, among other Hotels. At Conrad, my double room at the Executive Lounge was upgraded to a suite on the same floor may be because I am hhonors silver account holder. My suite has a commanding and amazing view from the floor to ceiling window. Checking-in was professionally done by ever smiling and dedicated staff. The Executive Lounge gives access to beer, wine, snacks, etc.The rooms were clean and spotless! They remained so till my departure. Indeed, the rooms were truly meant for the 21st century! The hotel is in a safe and good environment with very easy walking access to train and metro stations. The trains were very clean so is Tokyo. Notwithstanding that some Japanese I met could not communicate very well in English, they still went out of their way to help when they were approached.I enjoyed taking breakfast in the hotel’s restaurant which came with the room rate. The choice was wide with continental and Japanese menu, hot and cold options.At the end of my stay of 6 nights, the hotel arranged for a bus transfer to Narita airport. If I have a need to visit Tokyo in the future, Conrad Hotel will be my choice.","Owerri, Nigeria","LIVYTOKK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Owerri, Nigeria</strong>",20,5.0

Got off the limo and was greeted at the door and brought straight up to the lobby where they escorted me right up to the room, without a pause. The room was everything you'd hope for. Extremely comfortable, clean, with a sleek and modern design, and with all the amenities you'd need.

Visiting a friend in Tokyo allowed me the opportunity to come and spend a night here to explore The Conrad. From the moment you enter the building from the bustling streets outside you are met with a sense of calm. The staff are super attentive to your every need, the restaurants are stunning, the food is incredible and the rooms- just WoW! We stayed in a King City view room - I loved the innovative design to have a perspex wall between the bathroom and the bedroom- it made the room seem even more spacious and when privacy was needed a blind to divide the space was accessible at the touch of a button. The views at night were especially incredible with a sea of multi coloured lights in the buildings in front that looked like stars in front of you. There is also a Bay View side which looks over the garden and looked lovely- I hope to stay an equivalent open plan room that side of the hotel next time to see the Rainbow bridge lit up.There were also lovely personal touches- a Conrad crowned rubber duck to keep you company in the bath, an iPod speaker station, well stocked gorgeous scented amenities, a Conrad bear keyring at turn down and a delicate stem of live plant in a tiny test tube vase to bring outside life in to the room. Even the blossom carpet and bird wall motifs complemented the gorgeous colours of the room perfectly. To get an entry category room that has the light and lay out of your perfect room was like a dream and simply stunning.Everything was the very best quality and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to work colleagues and friends alike in the future. The staff are amazing with a special mention going out to Yutaka & Ari for taking such good care of us during our visit. I can't wait to come back and stay here again.

We loved our stay and will definitely try the Conrad brand in the future, and be back to Japan!!!PROS:Service: I don't know about other Japanese hotels service but after hearing great things and expecting a lot, the Conrad delivered! Everyone was so kind, helpful, attentive, and efficient. One night I requested a wake up call and in the morning when I didn't pick up the phone, a man came to our room to make sure we got the wake up alert. Amazing!!!Breakfast - very good spread, was included in our room rate. Lots of western and Asian offerings in the buffet, as well as a menu you could order off of. No complaints there!Location - near a large subway station which many lines ran through. Some walking required to get to the JR line but it was connected if you dealt with the labyrinthine subway stations -- which put any subway I've ever seen to shame, by the way! Near to Ginza and Shimbashi area. Very close to the Tsukiji fish market if you're into that.Amazing view from our room - get a Bay View room - we paid more but it was worth it!Since it was our honeymoon they gave us access to the Executive Lounge - nice happy hour nightly with wine, beers, snacks - good cheese plates!LARGE, IMPECCABLY CLEAN ROOMS! King size bed, beautiful large window seat overlooking the view, gorgeous bathroom with full tub, separate shower + toilet. The room was perfect. They provided slippers, robes, and fresh pajamas nightly which was a cool touch. Incredible. Randomly found the Japanese toilets fascinating and now my husband wants to install one in our home.CONS:The one snafu is I had emailed in advance to make restaurant reservations through the hotel and ended up falling ill the day of the reservation, which was going to result in a 100% cancellation fee (several hundred dollars). Luckily the hotel worked this out with the restaurant on our behalf so I guess it wasn't a con after all!Slightly hard beds. But we were so exhausted I still slept soundly every night. Obviously not much to complain about! We loved it! Thank you Conrad Tokyo!","New York City, New York","JMDTravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",11,5.0

It used to be a old Railway terminal, so the whole area is very new with plenty of skyscapers and roads which are still being built and planted pavements going on.I've been to Tokyo several times and have stayed in different areas.The hotel is located near Daimon, which is near a Shrine and the Tokyo Tower.This conrad is like many other Conrad's across the world, good quality looking and service in general ok. Well you are in Japan, and they do have a 'certain' way of doing things. So you just have to put up with it.We had executive lounge access and this lounge was quite basic. In the evenings during happy hours it did get very full.Service was so so, sometimes you did have to wait a while before someone came up to ask you what you would like to drink. But wasnt a big deal and in general they were helpful.In the room package, breakfast was included. Surprisingly for this hotel breakfast was somewhat dissappointing. Hotels in Asia, breakfasts are usually excellent and a little more than amazing I find. For Conrad, this was surprisingly below par.I stayed for 6 nights, and the breakfast selections which was quite limited especially the hot food didnt change once. So if you stay for more than 3 days I would say the breakfast does become a little boring. They do offer a menu to order eggs made to order, and this is the most shocking thing I would have not expected from a high end place like Conrad. I ordered the eggs benedict, and when I got it the 2 supposedly 'poached' egg was very very hard, and the shape was funnily enough resembling a hard boiled egg. after poking at it I just left it on the side. I put this down to a mistake so jsut left it as that. On the 3 or 4th day I was intrigued to see if this was the case, as you know a place like Conrad surely they can do a simple pached egg, rule of every kitchen chef, and I'm sure you would agree with me on this. So I ordered just a simple poached egg, when it came it confirmed it was the same oval shaped hard boiled style egg. The shape looked exactly like the first day it came on the eggs benedict, so I came to the conclusion they must be using a machine for it.Not a major factor, but doesnt look too good if an establishment like Conrad cannot do a simple poached egg.The breakfast did include lots of fresh fruit and juices, which was a bonus.Service of Staff in general including reception, house keeping, room service, laundry service and restaurant/breakfast service was good.The lobby does have a cafe, bar which has a good view of the city and the river so great for meeting up with friends or having a high tea, drink.Gym was good, well equipped.Stayed 6 nights.","London, United Kingdom","Mslondon1214</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",29,4.0

Top notch service, tranquility and an aesthetic that resonated with us.Service: After an early morning Redeye from SFO, we were ready to refresh ourselves before venturing into Tokyo, but our room wasn't ready yet given the early hour. The gentleman at the bell desk not only offered to keep our bags safe until check-in, but also arranged for us to use the spa facilities and showered therein to wash off some of the jet lag.Once we returned for a proper check in at noon, the desk staff clearly explained all the amenities made available via my HHonors Gold status and the AmEx FHR program we had used to book the room. They then explained that because of those programs and because we were on an anniversary celebration trip, we had been upgraded to a suite with a bay view! A small cake and two tiny bears were presented to us later to mark the occasion, a very nice and unexpected touch!From there on out, all our interactions with the staff at the restaurants and elsewhere where great. No hassles, and incredibly gracious service! We felt totally welcome and cared for.Room: The BayView King Suite was magnificent. Panoramic views of the Tokyo Bay, and a modern, dark wood and light surfaces motif made for an incredibly elegant space. The bathroom was well equipped and the heated floors were a nice addition! No shortage of space.Be advised that the beds are what we would consider on the hard side, at least compared to hotels we have stayed used in other regions. We didn't have any trouble getting good sleep, but we were mighty jet lagged for sure :)Et cetera: Holy cow the Conrad Breakfast! If you're going to order this for your room, come hungry. It's a lot of very, very tasty food.We couldn't get over how peaceful the hotel was. Yes this is very much a business hotel, but everything from the decor and layout to the service made this hotel an incredibly calming place to stay.---While we haven't stayed at a huge number of high-end hotels (several Four Seasons properties, Park Hyatt Washington, Shangri-La Sydney), the Conrad Tokyo is at the top of our list, and we wouldn't hesitate to come back next time we get to visit Japan!","San Francisco, California","rborkows</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",3,5.0

The people and the city of Tokyo are so clean and organized. Everyone goes out of there way to help you out. This mentality extends to the Conrad Tokyo. A fantastic hotel, very well located in Minato. Everything from the view, to the service provided was top notch. I always love staying at a Hilton property as breakfast is included if you are a Gold member, regardless of the brand. This perk is something a suspect sways many customers into choosing Conrad/ WA over other brands. When one is looking for the best place to stay during a trip, reviews always provide insight albeit somewhat subjective. I personally think it is worth paying a premium to stay at a lovely hotel. Although we spent most of our time out and about, the place where you rest after a busy day can effect the trip throughout. As mentioned the staff was very attentive, willing to help you without hesitation. When I have the opportunity to go back to Tokyo, I will definitely make it a point to stay at this Conrad again.","Atlanta, Georgia","seanismac</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",47,5.0

We planned a last minute trip to Japan over Chinese New Year and most hotels were booked up for the week. We were able to book a Bay View Suite for a reasonable price (for Tokyo) and weren't disappointed. The room itself was big and well appointed -- I do think some of the furniture (which is white) can use a little spruce up as could the hardwood floors, but nothing to deter from enjoying the room -- it was very big, bed was really comfy and the shower was very good (great water pressure!). We didn't eat at any of the restaurants, but we did order room service one night, which was good. Lobby bar was fantastic with great service and nice ambience, especially night with the fantastic views. We utilized the concierge services quite a bit to make dinner reservations, get dinner recommendations and to book tickets for two jazz concerts we attended. Everyone who helped us was great, but I'd like to give a special mention to Ryoko, who really spent time entertaining all my crazy requests! Location is fantastic with one subway line right below the building, and an interchange with other lines a mere 10 minute walk. Gym was well-appointed, and the pool was fantastic. We'd definitely recommend and hope to return on a future visit.","Singapore, Singapore","rajitha v</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",86,5.0

We booked the King suite bay view and it was amazing! The entire room was spacious, probably larger than most residential apartments that the locals live in. The bathroom had double sinks, rainfall shower, a soaking tub with tv, and best of all, a heated floor! Bed was really comfortable, and we liked how the blinds were controlled by the panels next to the night table. Speaking of the blinds, they opened up to a wonderful view of the Tokyo Bay!The Conrad staff was extremely friendly and helpful, always rushing to take care of us. The Concierge was exceptional - they helped us secure a few of the hard-to-get dinner reservations which we had emailed to them prior to our arrival.The location of the hotel was also superb. Situated right above the Shiodome metro station, we basically got around everywhere by taking the metro. We felt safe walking back to the hotel late at night since the station was connected by a few escalators. There's also a direct airport limousine bus between Narita and the hotel.The Conrad Tokyo was probably THE best hotel we have ever stayed in! They made us feel right at home. We took away a fantastic experience and a pair of cute Conrad bears. :) We highly recommend it to everyone visiting Tokyo and we'd definitely go back in the future.","San Francisco, California","KTfromBayArea</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",3,5.0

We had a king executive suite with a bay view, which has a separate living room area a walk-in closet and a huge luxurious bathroom. It had all the amenities you could want or need with the extra touches that make a hotel feel more like home.

They take your bags immediately while you're checking in. One person escorted us and moved the luggage into our room. The staff is very friendly and easy to speak with. They know a lot of English. The room and bathroom were both very spacious. The rooms have a modern/contemporary design and the finishing was excellent. They definitely invested in nice material to decorate and furnish the room. The liquid soaps smelled great! Very aromatic. Each bed had the tokyo bear which you could take and they even had the plastic conrad duck in the bathroom that you could take if you wanted to. Our room had a bathtub and shower stall. Both were separate from the toilet stall. It even had this electronic curtain that you could adjust to get a view of the world while sitting in the bathtub. The place was very clean and not the slightest smell of smoke. The slippers were comfortable. Had a little cushion in them and were fuzzy! The beds were firm (which I like) and the pillows were well cushioned and thick. Had excellent sleep. No noise pollution. Could not hear anything from the hallways, adjacent rooms, or from the streets. The room was well insulated and the heater worked well. They even provided a humidifier. The room was clean and did not get any bug bites from sleeping here.There were more than enough plugs for our 8 devices. There's wifi in the room, not exactly free but with status it is. It's just the hotel room number and person's last name.They had an executive lounge where you could go to relax and have some snacks. It was included with our room (probably because we had status with Hilton). Their concierge service was amazing. They were very friendly and took the time to answer all of our questions.I would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again if the opportunity presents itself again.","New York City, New York","Mystiqz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",116,5.0

All agents warmly greeted us and they always smile - this small gesture of friendliness makes all the different between a mediocre to a true 5*hotel.

The Bay view King & Twin Suites were fantastic, great size and well laid out, the harbor view is magnificent through the large windows.

Palace HotelPros:Better breakfast buffet with more variety.The 3 TVs in the room is great.Nice Anne Semonin products.Cons;Wireless internet was slow, I had to connect the wired cable.The desk chair had no wheels, it could only swivel.Conrad:Pros:Very proactive and friendly staff. Everyone would greet and smile.I have to mention Ayado san at Cerise restaurant during breakfast. She really made my day with her personal service and cheerfulness.The internet was great, very fast connection.Seamless perfect service, especially in the executive lounge.Cons;Breakfast buffet, has a small menu to select a hot entree.Executive lounge when busy, only has a sample platter during cocktail hour, not like the Seoul Conrad which had the food all laid out. I booked both hotels thru the visa signature collection. The Palace had a great rate which the visa program matched. Visa had a stay 4 nights or longer and get one night free rate at the Conrad. I like the location of Palace better, but if you are going to Makuhari Meese with Conrad, it is easier to take the metro to Shin Kiba and catch the Keiyo line there. You have to transfer, but it is better then walking the 500 plus meters thru Tokyo station to catch the Keiyo line when staying at the Palace. I would love to try the executive lounge at the Palace , but the rates are $500.00 plus a night .Both hotels are great, but I find better rates for the Conrad and I like the value and comfort just right for me.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Rcgaijin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",27,5.0
