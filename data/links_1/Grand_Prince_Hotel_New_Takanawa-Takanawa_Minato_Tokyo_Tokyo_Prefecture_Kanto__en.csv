It was, we thought, a luxurious and special place. We stayed eight nights in total, before and after a railway trip out of Tokyo. The public areas were spacious, elegant and distinctively decorated; our favourite was the superb Momiji Lounge with its views of the hotel's impressive garden. Breakfast in the Momiji was always a treat. The Japanese restaurant and the Club Lounge were also beautiful places. Our two rooms were less distinctive, but they could not be faulted: attractive, comfortable, convenient and wonderfully warm during a period of chilly, rainy weather. All the staff with whom we had contact, without exception, were excellent: so courteous and helpful. We were especially appreciative of the porters and bell staff -- they went out of their way to help -- and the perfect housekeeping service. The hotel's location was superb, close to Shinagawa Station, and there was a frequent shuttle service up the hill to the hotel. We would love to stay here again -- it really was a memorable stay.",Canberra,"CanberraSteve38</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra</strong>",121,5.0

The first room they put us in was small, and needed to be renovated. We asked for an upgrade for the next two nights, which was given to us at the price of 2000 yen per night, which was reasonable. The upgraded rooms, while better than the first one, needed refurbishment and some cleaning. The carpets in the hallways leading to the rooms definitely need replacement. We stayed on the 3rd, 8th, and 9th floors. This is a consistent need in the corridors. The breakfast buffet is very good. Nice selection of choices, both western and Japanese. The coffee was excellent. The staff in the restaurant were accommodating and pleasant.When we checked out for the second time (we stayed two different times), the hotel staff charged us for a late check out (9000 yen), even though we had an itinerary that stated we had paid for a ‘guaranteed late checkout’. This was something we debated with the check in staff person and the manager, and we believed it was all taken care of. Upon check out, however, they charged us the 9000 yen. Had we known that, we would have checked out on time, and left our luggage with the bell desk. It seemed like a ‘bait and switch’ to us.The location of the hotel is very convenient to the Shinagawa station. There are several other hotels in the near vicinity. If we go back to Tokyo, we will look at other options to the Grand Prince shin Takanawa.","Eagan, Minnesota","815suem</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Eagan, Minnesota</strong>",2,2.0

We had two separate stays in a week - before and after our trip to Kyoto. The first time our room was on the 12th floor, good view and renovated and we were very happy with it. The second time we were on the 3rd floor and the room was considerably more dated and configuration was odd - no drawers, closet didn’t have doors. But otherwise room was spotless, beds comfortable. Bathroom had big tub, good water pressure and scented bath salts, hair brush, shower scrub towel, razor, toothbrush and toiletries provided. No body lotion. Room had thermal water kettle, tea bags and instant coffee, complimentary water bottles. We booked with the breakfast buffet which was pricey but excellent for both western and Japanese options. There’s a 7-11 downstairs which is very convenient. The hotel was fairly empty when we stayed no doubt because of the coronavirus and all the staff had masks. Not sure how crowded it gets normally.

There are a multitude of restaurants and shops in the immediate area which do appear to be catering to tourists (which is fine).The hotel has a huge lobby which is nicely decorated, and a rather intimidating check-in area devoid of any warmth or personality. The check-in desk is placed smack in the middle of the room and makes the whole process seem a little too ""formal"". Checkin was nice, but absolutely robotic. In the event that you would like to stay a minute past checkout, you will be politely informed that that is not offered without a fee.The room itself was decent but quite underwhelming - I stayed on a high floor (Superior King Room, Non Smoking) with a decent view, but the room was absolutely stifling hot. I had to leave my window open in order to get it to any degree of being even slightly cool, as the hotel (as lots of larger hotels do) can only cool OR heat the building at one time, and the hotel had already been set to ""heat"" mode. This was a bit frustrating and disappointing.The room had an acceptable layout but the bathroom felt very, very dated and slightly cramped. My particular configuration was a shower-over-tub and did not mirror the experience that I had in the rest of my hotels in Japan (which tended to be a tub, adjacent to a shower stall). There was a small balcony attached to the room, which was essentially useless (size wise) but does provide a cute aesthetic.All said and done I would stay in this hotel again in a pinch, but I think the prices are a bit high for the accommodation that you are receiving. The service from the staff was impeccable, but as mentioned, slightly robotic.","West Palm Beach, Florida","SKITZOZTIKS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Palm Beach, Florida</strong>",23,3.0

Beautiful room with lovely views. Staff was professional, but appear uninterested. It was my 40th and although my travel agent asked for an acknowledgment, they completely ignored her request. My hubby ordered a ¥11,000 room service breakfast on my bday, and they didn’t offered anything in acknowledgement(perhaps just a coffee, or a cake, small chocolate, a card, or a flower? Nothing). For the price they charge, they could definitely deliver a higher lever of personalisation. They have great facilities, but when we went to the pool we were told that our little 3-year-old - who is toilet trained - was not allowed at the family pool, she would have to go to a tiny plastic pool instead (the water was barely reaching her waist...!). That was disappointing as one of the key reasons why we booked this hotel was because we wanted to use the pool, as it’s very hot in August in Tokyo. We were also charged around ¥3,500 to access this family pool area. Moreover, our little one was not allowed at the nice pool (in a different area), because they don’t allow under 16-year-olds there. Which we didn’t realize when we did the booking. For that reason, I wouldn’t say this hotel is family friendly, as a family friendly venue would allow families in all areas. Overall we had a good time as the location was amazing, the room was incredibly comfortable & spacious.

Restaurants in hotel are fairly small and comfortable with Japanese and Western items. Buffet breakfast is very unique and satisfying with a large selection of fresh items. English is spoken but most employees are more comfortable speaking Japanese. A few simple words of Japanese go a long way to making your stay even more enjoyable.

We were on the club floor (likely the miraculous appearance, as they didn't want to give us this room originally), but the club lounge was closed for reconstruction.

The food selection was good and fresh, but the service was quite lacking. The breakfast buffet is a full self-service buffet. There is no one to seat you, no one to bring water or coffee, and no one to clear your dishes. The tables are bare, so you have to find the utensils and napkins yourself. The coffee is hidden at the farthest corner of the room. I had to find someone to ask where it was and the only person I could find was the hostess outside of the restaurant.

We had a club king room and the bed was large enough for the adults and baby. There was a comfortable sofa for the older child to sleep on. Bathroom was decent, but be aware that it has a bathtub and shower in one. This is quite different from what appears to be standard in other Japanese hotels where the shower and bathtub are separate. The Club Room offered breakfast at the Club level and we happily took it. A nice little spread with a little for most tastes.

My club suite room on the 16th floor was generally well designed and had the amenities one would expect for a hotel in this category. The WiFi was a bit fiddly to set up - you first have to switch on the TV, work out how to set it to English with the remote control, and then navigate down the menu on the screen to access the access code - but was fast and reliable thereafter. The lounge/office was spacious with four tasteful abstract art images and inoffensive decor. It was well laid out and comfortable to work in. The Nespresso dolce gusto machine was a welcome addition and definitely kept me caffeinated.There were a reasonable number of power sockets but all were solely in the Japanese 2-pin format - there didn't seem to be any multi-purpose sockets or adaptors that would help international guests use their appliances. The lighting was relatively good and the provision of an air purifier (also in the bedroom) was a thoughtful gesture. I liked the fact that the windows were not sealed and that one could access a modest balcony.The bathroom is the weakest link. It had very poor lighting even when the slats in the louvre window to bedroom are opened to allow in some natural light. I guess it would be very unpopular with people trying to apply make-up. The designer taps on the twin sinks look great but the laminar flow water coming out of them invariably gets deflected out of the sink as soon as you try to wash your hands. Consequently, you spend time trying to mop up the flood to prevent damage to the room and to any toiletries nearby. Otherwise it's fine - the shower, for example, works very well. Perhaps inevitably, there is a 'smart' toilet that automatically detects you as you enter and responds by raising the cover on the toilet seat. If you are bored, see if you can get to seat without activating the motion sensor! The bedroom had a very comfortable bed with crisp white linen. Happily, the curtains block the light very effectively so one can get a good nights sleep. There are power sockets on both sides of the bed, which is handy when one wants to re-charge a phone but still have it nearby. Equally happily, it's possible to find your way to bed without leaving any lights on!The Club Room worked very well. There is a light supper option, from 5-7 pm, which may well allow many people to skip dinner. Typically, it features cold savoury options such as a pork rillette with dark chocolate, smoked salmon, a salad with raw fish and tomatoes, and a selection of cold meats. There is also a good selection of drinks including sparkling wine.

While it wasn't a bad hotel, it made me stay away from Shinagawa the next few times I was in Tokyo. This time, my boss was staying at Grand Prince Hotel New Takanawa, I decided to give it a try. The hotel surprised me in a good way in many areas.Getting to the hotel is easy. It is a 5 minute walk once you get out of Shinagawa Station (Central Gate - Takanawa exit). It is uphill which can be challenging if you have big luggage. They do have a shuttle from the station that runs from 8 am to 9:20 PM. It shows up every 20 minutes (:00, :20, :40). The hotel is the last stop so it can take about 10 to 15 minutes before you are back at the hotel. It is usually faster to just walk but it is convenient when you are tired.The hotel itself has a large and beautiful lobby. When I checked in, I was immediately surrounded by very helpful staff who offered me help with my luggage. Check-in was smooth and quick. I had a non-smoking room and I was worried that it was one of those converted rooms where you can still smell the smoke. My room was fine and did not have any smell. My room also had an air purifier which also helped with the quality of air in the room. The size of the room was generous by Tokyo standards. In fact, I would say that it was one of the bigger non-ryokan rooms I had in Japan. This is great was it made packing some of our bigger bags a lot easier.I would be remiss if I did not talk about the staff at the hotel. In my mind, they are the star of the hotel. They were super friendly and always smiling. They helped me with taxis, restaurant reservations, and answering my questions quickly. My stay at the hotel was broken up into two different stays. They were able to hold my luggage for me until I return. The main negative and why I did not give the hotel 5 stars is that it got really crowded during the weekend. It isn't their fault but it is a popular hotel for tour groups and a few airlines have their crew staying there too. When it got crowded, the staff tried their best to direct traffic and keep the elevators flowing. It helped a little but not enough to take away the feeling of feeling crowded.Shinagawa is a convenient station to start your day as it is well connected. It is also a lot quieter than Tokyo, Shibuya, or Shinjuku.

Our reservation was for 'The Club Floor Stay'. This stay plan includes, obviously, a room on the so-called 'Club Floor' and use of the Club Lounge.Arrival and check in: There is a shuttle bus from Shinagawa station. You can walk it easily but it is up hill and mid-summer with a suit case you might as well jump on the bus that seems to be about every twenty minutes. As we were staying on the Club Floor, we could check in there. All very smooth and efficient.Service: This is very much a Japanese hotel. Of course, foreigners do stay here but the service and attitudes are completely Japanese. What does this mean? Well, it means that the service is excellent, extremely polite, attentive and efficient. But all the usual Japanese sensibilities are present. I have no opinion on the matter other than to note, for example, the signs at baths and pool saying ""People with tattoos are not allowed to use these facilities. If we find even one tattoo, no mater how small (whatever the age), you will be asked to leave immediately"". Which I found a little comical as it conjured up images of a team of people hunting high and low on guests for even one tattoo, no matter how small. I have no idea of the relevance of the age (of tattoo or guest, I am not sure).Room: We were on the fifteenth floor, room 3554. Wonderful view out over Tokyo. By day and by night. But it would have been a lot better if they did not have solid panels for the balcony rail. So, great view when standing up but nothing to see when sat down. The room was well appointed with a big king bed. Very comfortable.Pool: Two shallow pools, the Diamond Pool and the Sky something. I don't think that either of them was more than 1.2 metres deep, but it was pleasant enough to splash around and relax on the loungers. The Diamond pool shuts at, um 18:00, I think, but the Sky pool is open until later and the lights come on in the evening, when youngsters under sixteen years of age are not allowed.Club Lounge: This alone would not justify the price of the package. It is bright, yes, with a view to the opposite side of our room (i.e. not a view of the Tokyo Tower), but it is not particularly spacious. Free drinks and nibbles and that in the evening includes alcohol. People on the Club Stay plan have breakfast here.Breakfast: I don't know what breakfast is available downstairs but in the Club Lounge, this was probably the lowest level of the overall stay. A two-star breakfast at most. I've had better in a standard business hotel. And it is a cramped affair with care being needed to stop plates overflowing off of the little table.Other facilities: We enjoyed using the bath in the Sakura Prince Tower (""No tattoo, no matter how small""), which was available as part of our stay plan. The bath was not particularly hot but there is a wet and dry sauna, if that is your thing. The Japanese garden is really lovely. The bell there is from the seventeenth century and the koi pond, shrubs and bridges contribute to a really delightful setting.","Nagoya, Japan","m1ch43lj0hn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nagoya, Japan</strong>",27,4.0

It is modern and very nicely furnished. The checkin staff are efficient and business like, but not overly friendly. Checking in is a bit like going to a bank, you line up and wait for the next available service officer to serve you. Same when you are checking out. The most pleasing aspect of our room was its size. It was a large room with plenty of space to spread your things around, without tripping over them if you have to get up during the night. The bathroom, on the other hand, was relatively small and a bit dull really, BUT they did have one of those fantastic Japanese toilets. You really feel as though you are in the drivers seat when you use these toilets. The room looks as though it has been fairly recently remodelled and the layout changed. The large king size (twin double) bed faces the window. The bed head with light controls etc are behind you, meaning you have to reach behind and over your head to find & turn the lights off. There was a couch behind the bed; not particularly functional as a couch & a waste of space, but good as another place to spread your gear on. The TV is on what is now the side wall, so if you want to watch TV in bed, it is at a right angle to you and you have to turn on your side to watch it, which is a bit strange. Also, the air conditioning controls are supposedly tucked away in the wardrobe. I could not find it, so the A/C was not really comfortable.There is a small balcony if you want to check out the outside view.We didn't eat at the hotel, as we arrived late so I am unable to comment on the hotel's restaurants. There are plenty of shops and restaurants within a close walk of the hotel. Free WiFi is avalaible.In summary, there is little wrong with this hotel. It caters for all the needs travellers usually look for and it is comfortable enough.

I have visited Tokyo almost 10 times and my stays in your hotel was the most unhappy experiences I ever had.When I checked in on 2/21, the staff at the front desk asked for credit card for deposit. I asked “if I pay cash now, why do you need my credit card? I had just checked in on 2/16 previously, and the staff didn’t ask me to give credit card for deposit. Both bookings were made online, no difference.” The staff replied “this is our policy”. After some argument, although your staff didn’t insist the credit card, our family felt very uncomfortable about their attitude. I have stayed in many of the hotels in Tokyo, and every time I was willing to pay cash at the front desk, none of the hotels asked for credit card for deposit. This was the first situation I met, and I was very shocked and disappointed.Secondly, when my parents searched restaurant for breakfast, they passed もみじ restaurant and asked one of the staffs where is the restaurant, a lady replied “wait a moment” and walked away. Only until a few minutes later, another male staff came over and indicated the direction. And when the male staff gave direction to my parents, the pervious lady just took a look of my parents and didn’t say anything.Third, the staff forgot to put clean towels in my parents’ room after cleaning the room and I had to call room service for towels. Again, this was my first time experienced your staff forgot to put clean towels in the roomLastly, during the winter time, there is only heat no air conditioning in the room. So the temperature in bedroom was very hot. Although I have opened the windows to let cold air came in, the room was still hot and hardly fall asleep at night. The amenities in the bed room and shower were kind of old.Overall speaking, I felt although this hotel is very big and have many facilities than other middle size business type hotel, the training for their staffs seems not enough. And I rarely felt the staffs were willing to help and their attitude was not very friendly. I have stayed in another big hotel in Daiba last year, and their service and attitude was much better than this hotel. And I feel their rooms and other facilities were more clean and new.

Location: All three are within walking distance to shops/restaurants and the Shinagawa Station for convenient access to metro lines and trains. Prince Hotel is the closest to the station (just across the street) and shops and restaurants (literally at the door). You have to walk uphill for 5 - 10 minutes to the other 2 hotels from the station and shopping/restaurant area. But the environments there are quieter, particularly the Grand Prince Takanawa, which also has a very nice Japanese garden right behind it. Rooms: Prince hotel has by far the smallest rooms. Grand Prince Takanawa has the most spacious and comfortable rooms. Services: Services at all three hotels are professional and efficient. Services at Grand Prince Takanawa are the most attentive of the 3. Overall, I would recommend the Grand Prince Takanawa if you do not mind good walking exercises up and down the hill, and the Prince Hotel if you do not want to walk that much.","Raleigh, North Carolina","Hahnt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Raleigh, North Carolina</strong>",18,4.0

I picked this hotel as it was the first to come up in the list and had a pretty decent nightly rate. It also seemed fairly close to Shinagawa train station which was good.Upon arrival after a long trip on the train from Narita airport I exited the station and proceeded to walk up the street to where the hotel entrance was. What seemed like a short distance walk on the map, was in fact over 500m up a hill. So while it was close to the station, it wasn't close enough to make it convenient to walk to with luggage in tow.The hotel itself appeared new and had lavish decor well suited for wedding banquets and corporate functions. It also offered plenty of onsite restaurant options, but most were quite expensive. There is an onsite convenience store however which was nice to see.Staff are very friendly and speak pretty fluent english. The one huge disappointment for me was that I had booked a non-smoking room and at checkin they offered me a smoking room. I immediately corrected them saying I needed NON smoking, but was told there were no non-smoking rooms left. Seriously??! Not even one? The hotel didn't appear that full... All I was given was a half-hearted apology and no option but to check into a room on a smoking floor. Needless to say the room stunk of stale smoke and felt dingy and dirty right from the start. I did not realize until the next morning that there was a balcony to the room and that the door to it could be opened to let in some fresh air. But it was cold that night and I'm not sure I would have wanted to sleep with the door open anyway.At check-in there was also no option given for an included breakfast so I don't even know if one is offered. But I had a very expensive american-style breakfast in the main floor lounge. A very small portion of plain omelet, 1 sausage link, a small piece of bacon, toast, very watery coffee, and a tiny glass of juice for the equivalent of $40. Not good value, and not even a Japanese breakfast option...Overall this hotel was just average for me. Nice enough in decor and service, but not being able to hold down a non-smoking room really turned me off and the expensive food options on site were also a minus. While the rooms are smaller, the Shinagawa Prince Hotel right across from the station is a much better value.","Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","d4kim</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada</strong>",13,3.0

The linens on the bed, and the towels and bathroom were clean. Room was extremely warm, despite turning off the heat. Had to open sliding glass door and sleep with door open just to get some relief. Did not sleep well because of the uncontrollable heat. I advise using the re useable slippers provided in the closet and not to put your feet on the carpet. Both pools were uncovered, dirty, and not available to use in February. Not much of a fitness room so did not bother. No spa. Located near a small mall and some local and chain restaurants.

Staff was efficient and extremely polite.Charged an extra $75/day for my wife to accompany me. Not informed of this until check in!

Of note, check out at 11 am was a mad house, so go early!!! Breakfast was included ( but not $75 worth!) and was ok, with no lines or waiting in lobby or at buffet in basement.

I was booked at this hotel for 7 days by my hosts and I chose to stay extra days while attending to other business. The location is great if you have to travel in the Shinagawa ward of Tokyo, and it is down the hill to the JP Shinagawa station with very convienent access to the rest of Tokyo and Japan. Plenty of places to eat, especially on the other side of the station in the Konan neighborhood. Old meat packing area of town so there are some great barbeque places!I arrived two hours early, and my room was not ready. Check in is at 2 pm, and there were many of us waiting in the lobby, and this scene was repeated daily. So don't expect an early check in. Lobby is comfortable and free Wifi is decent.Rooms are nice size and amentities are at the level you would expect for the money you pay per day. It is important to request a non smoking room if you do not wish to absorb the smoking smell. The problem for me was that my room was hot and there was no way to turn on the air conditioner. I called the guest services line and some one came up right away to check on the situation. I speak some Japanese and I was told that once the hotel switches to the winter mode, only the heater was functional and there was no way to turn on the air conditioner. So I kept my balcony door open for the stay. Forutnately my room was on the opposite of the street. It was okay until they started construction and the banging started before the sun rose.The breakfast option is a nice perk. You get three choices. The buffet has all you can eat and it can get a little crazy. I liked the Japanese option and the hotel lounge option. Definitely quieter and much more relaxing. Food was good, but just not all you can eat. I always ate outside the hotel for my other meals in other areas of Tokyo. That's the fun part of the city. However, if you need a midnight snack, there is a 7-11 convenience store on the level below the lobby. Exercise facilities are very basic. Two treadmills, two bikes. No TV so take your smartphone. Good wifi connection for streaming. The front desk staff were definitely hit or miss on their Englsih and hospitality. I would not stay at this hotel again, if I had a choice. Service and room did not match the room cost.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","808DawnPatrol</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",28,2.0

Both hotels are located in the same area and are very similar from all aspects. The good: - The location near Shinagawa station is very convenient.- There is a shuttle to and from the hotel every 20 minutes most of the day. - Quick and professional service by staff- Access to a good gym (at additional cost of 2100 JPY per visit, but at least you have the option). Located in the Sakura Tower accessible through the garden.The less good:- Some noise from neighbouring rooms- If you get a room close to the elevator the vibrations can be extremely annoying- A bit difficult to find your way around- The breakfast options aren't great. The lounge restaurant by the lobby is just plain bad, and the buffet style restaurant downstairs has a long waiting line at peak times in the morning and is horribly planned. Want a bowl of yoghurt? Get the bowl in one end of the room, get the yoghurt in the other and then realize that the spoons are yet somewhere else. Unacceptable.

Anyway, I was told that hotel was fully booked and that no non-smoking room was available. For a non-smoker, it wasn't comfortable for me. I find it strange that at 3.15pm, such a large hotel has already managed to check in all of its guests (usually there should be people who check in later in the day). Even its 2 other sister hotels nearby were also fully booked so all could do was to do ""air cleaning"" which essentially was just sending a staff to quickly spray the room but it didn't help much. Other than being a smoking room, room is average and dated. There was no ladies' amenities such as cotton pads which I had to call Operator and they delivered quickly. The good things about the hotel are that it is quite near and there's a shuttle us to Takanawa station and that hotel staff (Front Desk agent + Houseskeeping staff) responded quickly but I wouldn't stay at this hotel again.","Singapore, Singapore","travelthewonders</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",26,3.0

The bathroom was also nice and spacious, it had plenty of counter space and a nice shower/tub that had simple water temperature controls and even an adjustable pressure shower head. The balcony is also accessible which is a nice feature but I felt a bit lonely out there as it doesn't seem like anyone really uses them since you can see all of the other vacant balconies.The hotel itself is about a ten+ minute walk from the station (the hotel website claims it's a five minute walk but realistically from the station entrance to the hotel's side entrance it is certainly not unless you speedwalk), and mind you it is all uphill so if you are in a rush it feels more like a hike. If you decide to jump in a taxi it's approximately ¥750 from the west side of the station and will get you to the hotel in about two minutes. The hotel also has a convenience store on basement floor 1 that I think is open until 1 a.m.This hotel has a great location just for proximity to Shinagawa Station, as you get extremely convenient access to Shinkansen lines as well as the Narita Express. One stop away on the Yamanote Line at Osaki Station gives you a convenient transfer point to the Rinkai Line for access to Odaiba and even the Disney Resorts (with one more transfer to the Keio Line at the terminus in Shin-Kiba).

The rooms themselves are substantially larger then my prior 3 hotels in Tokyo this week and well equipped with coffee, stocked mini bar and plentiful bathroom amenities. An added convenient feature of this hotel is an ongoing shuttle bus from the hotel Property to the transportation hub (Shinagawa station). From this station about a 10-minute walk downhill from the hotel if you prefer walking, you can travel to any point in Japan. I use the station for subway trips back into downtown Tokyo as well as the express train to Narita Airport (NEX) which stops only once briefly in Tokyo Station on the way. This is the most convenient way to get to the airport as it removes the element of unexpected traffic delays and gets you into your terminal in about 1 hour (vs minimum 90 minutes on the limousine bus at similar cost).

This hotel is a perfect stay for families, singles and couples alike, looking for a quieter alternative to the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku and Shibuya.I would recommend this area if you were looking at travelling on the bullet train the day after arrival, or to wind down the end of your trip back in Tokyo for a couple nights before you fly home from Narita.","Melbourne, Australia","71Majj13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",13,4.0

It is a 5-10 minute walk up a moderate incline to get to the lobby. The building is undergoing some renovations in the lobby area so the registration counter and concierge are not much to look at but still fully functional.I have heard many rooms in Japan are cozy to put it nicely, however I found my room on the 12 floor to be as spacious as any other in the USA. Nicely sized bath and sleeping area. The electronic bidet on the toilet is silent which would have been a delight to my toddler who hated the noise from the automatic flush and auto-open/close toilet lid feature he experienced at another Japanese hotel. I did not partake of the in hotel dining options, instead I was an frequent visitor to the 7/11 downstairs which was fairly well stocked. I was amazed that a 500ml bottle of Evian runs just 120 yen there. There are also many touristy dining options and Pachinko parlors as you head back to the train station. If you are looking for something local an inexpensive just walk to the other side of the Shinagawa station. I had a bowl of chicken somen noodles plus sides for ~900 yen, an inexpensive yet filling dinner after a long haul flight.The concierge desk was very helpful and patient while helping me look for a spa with ""doctor fish"" to treat my feet.The rooms are quiet, never heard my neighbors. The beds and linens are very comfortable. I wish the flat screen was a bit bigger and with more TV channels available both local and international. Using Ookla from the room, the WiFi speeds are impressive >10Mbps download easy. I forgot my international plug adapter at home so I just showed my three prong US plug to the front desk and they had an adapter waiting for me that evening.If the train is not an option, taxis are readily available. I was able to catch one within 10 minutes even at the busy rush hour. I recommend the location being in the mid point with Tokyo Station / Ginza District on one direction of the Yamanote Line and the Shinjuku, Shibuya and Harajuku stations on the other.","San Jose, California","WillieC573</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",48,4.0

The room wifi was very good, but connectivity suffered in the lobby. Overall condition of the hotel felt clean and fresh, although the decore and fixtures are beginning to show their age. We made use of the excellent concierge when we needed help contacting a local airline. When you question the expense of a hotel of this type, services such as a concierge to help smooth your travel arrangements are well worth the cost. There are certainly cheaper options for accommodation, but the services offered by a full on hotel such as this quickly justify the cost. I cannot fully express how friendly, helpful, professional, patient, and courteous the staff were. We felt welcome, tended to, and at ease our entire stay. I highly recommend this hotel and I look forward to staying again when we return to Tokyo. Thank you so much to the staff and management of the Grand Prince Hotel New Takanawa.","Edmonton, Alberta","Grendel213</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Alberta</strong>",14,4.0

Kids thought the player piano was cool (live person only in the evening), and the buffet breakfast had both western and Japanese treats. But the weather was exceptionally warm, and the kids stood on the balcony more than once looking longingly at the huge outdoor pool that was closed for the season. As an adult, the whiskey bar was exceptional if not hidden, smokey and dark, nestled in the main lobby. I found myself more than once in the basement 7-Eleven across from the breakfast room. We splurged for a dinner at one of the hotel restaurants - very expensive. I would suggest this hotel as a fine place for business trip or a quick stop, but not for family.

The age shows in some hardware, which can actually be surprisingly lovely (original balcony railings from the 70s) or just kind of drab (bathrooms, for example). The place has history, and you can see it also in the very proper training the staff apparently receive. Check in and check out were very efficiently managed. When we complained of slamming doors and hallway chit chat, we were immediately moved to a quieter location. If your budget allows, I'd suggest saving yourself (and the night porter) the hassle by upgrading to the Modern or Club tier and requesting a corner room.

Breakfast served buffet style can be partaken at their different restaurants but I always have mine at Marmolada which is nearer the lobby and have a little more spacious set up. Selection was adequate, with various cuisines available, but I kind of like the inclusion of different types of juices and soda in the buffet . Staff service was worth commending, almost all of them are very polite and approachable , and this was consistent throughout my stay.

Both of me and my friend arrived at Shinagawa (Shinkansen) station and proceeded directly to Takanawa (West) exit. Once we exit the station until we reach the main intersection, it is a 5-6 minutes walk. It is quite a challenging walk if someone carries heavy luggage with him/her as the street is going slightly uphill.Once we reached the hotel, we went up 1 floor to the lobby and once we exit from the elevator, turn right and we could see a huge size hotel lobby quite a bit of walk from where the elevator was. Check-in was done within ten minutes of our arrival at the front desk. They assigned our room in 12th floor almost in the end of the hallway which was quite a walk as well. One unusual thing I found when I looked at the room number : Our room was in 12th floor but the room number started with 32xx where the last two digits reflected the room number.Our room was acceptable in size, nothing to complain about; after all, we stayed in Japan and small hotel rooms was something we had to deal with and accept when we stayed at many hotels. However, the bathroom was slightly bigger than normal hotels which was quite nice as we had extra space to move around but still could not be compared to bathroom in Grand Pacific Le Daiba which was larger than this one.Our room was clean : Although this hotel obviously showed its age but it was very well maintained. The nicest thing was the fact that they had tiny balcony just outside each room. Since our room was located in 12th floor, we could still get a nice view overlooking Shinagawa's area both during the day and night. One thing I liked about this hotel was their lounge : It was nicely designed overlooking their famous garden.It was a peaceful experience sitting down in their lounge and enjoyed the garden from where we were sitting. Their design reminded me with the ones in Shangri-La Hotels where they designed many of their lounges with similar design (glass from floor to ceilings overlooking gardens). I didn't have any chance to try out the breakfast as we had other things to do during the the next morning and both of us checked out very early from the hotel, after two nights stay, as we had to take Narita Express to Narita International Airport early in the morning that day. However, I will not be so surprised that the food quality in this hotel is better than average by looking at the way they run such massive hotel in this location. FYI, this hotel is located in a huge parcel of land which shared by 3~4 other hotels owned by the same company (if I am not mistaken). Overall, I would recommend this hotel to every one who is looking classy yet elegant hotel accommodation nearby Shinagawa station. This hotel property is not a new one but it is very well maintained and someone could experience a bit of Japanese culture in this hotel.","Semarang, Indonesia","Bambang S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Semarang, Indonesia</strong>",297,4.0

My room was read early and I was grateful! At the time of check in I asked about the airport limousine to the airport and requested a reservation for 1:15 pm the next day. I also asked which terminal my airline was in because the schedule shows arrival time based on the terminal. I was provided accurate information and proceeded to my room. The room was spacious, clean, and all rooms seem to have a balcony, at least on the side I was on. I toured the 5 acres of gardens which were peaceful. The stores and restaurants on site leave a lot to be desired for quality and price. Research local restaurants and eat elsewhere. I ate at the Chinese restaurant and everything is priced for two! Yes, I could have gone elsewhere, but Chinese was the only choice in the hotel I was interested in. After a serving of braised chili shrimp that was lukewarm, I was disappointed. The crab fried rice was excellent! The steam vegetables for one were tasteless, unseasoned eggplant, carrots, mushrooms, sweet potato, bok choy, and okra..........don't order it. I love veggies but this was a very poor presentation at $8 US just for the vegetables.A problem with communication was experienced in two instances. I changed my airport limo bus reservation from 1:15 to 12:15 p.m. after receiving notice from the airline that the flight time had been moved up 20 minutes. I asked for the reception desk and for someone that spoke English. The lady changing the reservation sounded like the same on that checked me in 3 hours earlier. The next morning at 10:30 I arranged for my luggage to be picked up from my room at noon. I was assured that the bell staff would be there at noon. I was headed out to eat and I paid for the limo bus to the airport and was asked to sign a document to pick up my tickets at the bell desk. I signed the document without reading it and picked up my ticket. I returned to my room at 11: 30 am and waited for the bellman. At noon I called for the bell man and talked to reception. Long story short, they arrived at 12:05 asking which airport I was going to (I gave this information and the airline at check in the day before, that's how I knew which terminal I needed to go to). They tagged my bags, took them to the bell stand and I waited outside for the bus it is now 12:10 p.m... I saw the bus arrive. I waited for my luggage and then the bus took off without me or my luggage. I immediately asked the bell desk what happened. They said my reservation is for 1:15!!!! UGH!!! I explained the change in reservation the previous day and asked what could they do since my flight was at 5 pm and the airport is an hour away and I had an international flight. Then I looked at the paper I signed which stated that my reservation was 2:15!!! If I signed a form for 2:15 why was my luggage tagged for 1:15? Get all critical communications IN WRITING!All communication issues aside, the hotel had great little gift shops on sight an their sister properties for last minute gifts. The shopping at the hotel is on the lobby level and B1 has larger stores.A good cheap breakfast, and possibly other meals can be found down the hill and across the street at Royal Host.

It is an old hotel. (Updates have been made to the rooms. Some of them at least.) there's a 7-11on the lobby floor which is nice to get late night snacks and beverages. The service is great but that is typical of japan. There are a couple things I do really like about this hotel. One, unlike the other prince hotels in the area, this hotel has a balcony. The rooms in japan run small so I usually like to place my suitcase on the balcony. Also good because the rooms can get humid if someone takes a hot shower. The rooms don't smell like mold or an ashtray. Shinagawa prince and takanawa prince both had those issues. I read somewhere that the location wasn't good. I think the walk to the station is pretty short. Just don't go from the the lobby exit. There is a side exit. Just ask where the bakery is (1 flight of stairs down on the side of hotel). Go out, make a left and walk straight down to the station. Shinagawa is a major station and has food counters, shopping, and restaurants in the station. Easy to get in and out of. Just buy a 140 yen ticket from the ticket machine. There's also restaurants on top of Queen's Isetan (instead of going past the ticketing counter on the right, go straight and you'll see the entrance on the left of the Queen's sign.Back to the hotel. The lounge is always empty and the bar is dull. There's other restaurants in the hotel but they're not great.

It was the first hotel at which I stayed in Japan, and initially I was satisfied with it, assuming that this is what Japanese hotels were like. However, after having travelled for two weeks in Japan, and then staying at this hotel again at the end of the trip, I came to the conclusion that this hotel is overpriced for what you are getting, the maintenance of the hotel is substandard by Japanese standards (which are very high, in general) and there are likely better options in Tokyo.Pros:- Beautiful garden setting- Reasonable room size- Outstanding breakfast buffet (extra cost)- Clean (the staff did the best they could given the condition of the rooms).Cons:- Furniture in both my rooms needed either replacement or cleaning. (The upholstery was stained).- The bathroom, quite simply, smelled, in both rooms (as the previous reviewer also noted). I kept the door closed for that reason.- The hotel is a long way from the Shinagawa station. This becomes a bit of an issue if you are carrying luggage with you.- There are no nearby restaurants or shops. For that, you need to make the trek down to the Shinagawa station area about two or three blocks away.Shinagawa station itself is an excellent base from which to explore Tokyo, and it also has very good access to the Tokyo airports. There are quite a few restaurants and shops in the immediate area of the station. I would stay in this area again, but would probably select a different hotel. For example, the Keikyu Ex hotel is directly across from the Shinagawa station (much more convenient) and costs appear to be similar, so I might try that instead next time.",calgary,"geo3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>calgary</strong>",143,3.0

It has a large garden within its property. And its about 10 minutes walk to the well-connected Shinagawa Train Station. The uphill walk from the train station to the hotel maybe a little strenuous for some people.I had a bad check-in experience with a rude staff. When asked for a second room key card, the answer was a very stern ""NO"", no apology or any kind reply. Confused, I repeated my question and was given the same stern ""NO"" answer.The room is pretty small and the ceiling is low, maybe it's a standard Japanese specification. I feel a little claustrophobic in the room. The carpet in both my rooms and along the corridor need a bad shampoo and thorough vacuuming. Fortunately there're sandals provided for the room, otherwise I'll be very worried about stepping on the carpet. To compliment the small size of the room, the bathroom can only accommodate only one person at a time. And the bathtub should have a new coat or be replaced. I would not allow my family to soak in that bathtub. Maybe due to the use of the flooring material in the bathroom, there's a persistent urine smell that refuses to go away, even after extended ventilation. And this happened in both our rooms.Room service is bad. Not kids friendly at all. No kids menu, food items selection is limited, no lunch hour room service, uncompromising service attitude (cannot make changes to food item to accommodate kids' taste), ""Prince One"" service button on the telephone is useless, behaved like a phone operator function.Somehow, I just feel that this hotel is not very friendly towards foreigners in terms of its facility and its service attitude.I wouldn't recommend this hotel for family travellers, especially foreigners travelling with young family.","Singapore, Singapore","kwp333</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",19,2.0

Don't ever attempt to walk to the hotel with your huge luggage. I read some of the reviews here which said that it was a 5 mins walk and easy even with luggage, that is not true.

There is a shuttle bus. Unfortunately no signs. The trick was, as you walk down the staircase or escalator after locating the The Takanawa East exit, just walk straight ( when I said walk straight you go straight after the escalator. Don't turn left or right) to the end of the station. Don't cross the road, just wait there. Every 10 mins the Prince Hotel small Mini Bus will come by.

The newly renovated rooms are very nice and clean. My room had a balcony facing beautiful bamboo forest. Service is also very good.

This hotel had a huge lobby! And free wifi at your room, which was of course awesome. What I like about this hotel is that its quite near the Shinagawa Station, approximately 15minutes depending on how fast you walk. Some restaurants are also near the vicinity such as TGIFridays, a Singapore restaurant, and a Steakhouse. Inside the hotel, there's a small 7-11 convenience store where you can buy bottled water (safer), a nail salon, souvenir shop etc. There were also restaurants below the hotel where we ate our breakfast. The rooms were clean and neat. They provided pillows and fluffy comforters. Haha I was able to sleep well for 2 nights. The downside of the hotel: there's a small balcony from my room overlooking the hotel's pool.. And oh my!! it was a very dirty pool!!! Nobody dares to swim there coz nobody cleans it.

I made reservation directly with hotel through a promotion that they were running. Similar prices were on Agoda and also Expedia. At check-in, they told me that my son was considered an adult and that they needed to charge me more for the room. When booking, I saw nothing as far as rate per person and I recall seeing the age being around 12 years old for children. Either way, management worked with me on the situation and check me in under the room rate that I had reserved originally. It was a bit confusing but I am glad that management worked with me versus wanting to charge me more.The basic rooms was quite nice and roomy. The balcony is a nice. There us a desk in the room which is helpful for any work or planning you need to do. The room was modern with a nice flat screen TV set and a safe and a small sofa to separate out the room. Overall, for the price, the room was quite good and I would stay here in a second on my next return trip back to Tokyo if the room rate was reasonable.Another consideration for this hotel is how close this is to the train station and that the hotel has a shuttle service running to the train station every 10 to 15 minutes. One suggestion is that it when you do get off the NEX, from the airport, if you go to the exit, a bus will come along and take you to the appropriate Prince Hotel.

Amazingly, the hotel is in exactly the same state it was the last time. The Hotel is located up a slight hill about 10 minute walk from Shinagawa Station. This is useful because Shinagawa is one of the stops on the Narita Express route from Narita Airport after Tokyo station. In addition, Shinagawa is on the JR Yamanote line that circles Tokyo so its a brilliant location as a base to explore Tokyo. I prefer being in Shinagawa as I don't enjoy the assault on the senses being in some of the other popular accommodation options in Tokyo ie Shibuya, Shinjuku etc. The hotel is part of a larger complex of 3 hotels under the Prince Group on the Takanawa side of Shinagawa Station. In between the 3 hotels, there is a garden where you can have your own private cherry blossom viewing if you are in Tokyo around April.I booked everything online and opted for the Club floor whilst booking the children in a standard room. Having seen both rooms, I would recommend that one just sticks to the standard rooms and save a bit of money. Check in was a breeze with the receptionist able to speak passable English. The hotel also has a Convention Centre on the grounds so is adept at handling large Groups. I had opted for the breakfast option at the hotel for convenience but there were breakfast options at a much cheaper price down the road towards Shinagawa station.The room was reasonably spacious and more importantly was one of the few hotels in Tokyo with a balcony. We had many of our dinners at Wings Building directly opposite the Shinagawa Station, next to the Hollywood Pachinko parlour. We were not disappointed with the meals we had and found the prices quite reasonable. One tip however is have dinner early as the restaurants all fill up by 7pm everyday.All in all was very happy with the Hotel and it's location. So I now have two hotels I enjoy in Tokyo, both have balconies for the smokers out there, the Prince New Takanawa and also Nikko on Tokyo Bay.","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Kebuh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</strong>",189,4.0

However, this seems to be a fairly standard experience at most Tokyo hotels, so perhaps expectations need to be recalibrated when you travel here. Check-in took more time than usual, probably due to it being handled by a trainee with very-limited english-language skills. After a 20minute processing time, I was finally on my way to my room. Do note, though, that the room numbers here do not tally with the floor numbers! :-) - I had room number 34xx, which happened to be only the 14th floor (and not 34th as I imagined!) The room in itself was just OKAY, a bit dated and worn at the edges. It definitely needs a good spring cleaning (carpets were stained and dirty, and the bathtub was chipped in places). See attached pictures. What was quaint, though, was that each room comes with its own little Juliet-balacony - however, with no view to enjoy, this is a no-brainer. Everything other than the room was chargeable as extras! :-) - Breakfast costs extra (and the quality is rather poor!), using the pool costs extra, and internet costs extra too!... There was no iron in the room (something that I consider a basic requirement on most business trips)... and ironing was always at extra cost. Choice of restaurants in the hotel were a bit dicey, and the meals I have had at the Grand Prince are best described as sub-standard (both in-room and in the restaurants). The hotel is conveniently located just a 5-minute walk from the Takanawa exit of Shinagawa station, which really is a boon since the Narita Express as well as most major JR trains stop here. The walk up to the hotel is uphill, though - so better to take a cab if you have a lot of luggage. The area is always busy, so it is fairly easy to find a restaurant to dine in if you are not keen to partake of the poor food at the hotel.... many restaurants nearby, and more opposite the Konan exit from the station...

(The prices at Wing were much cheaper that the food shops within the train station).

The multi-level station is huge, and with many levels, but not at all daunting thanks to the hotel's concierge's printed instructions on platform, level and entry/exit points at Shinagawa Station itself, as well as for stations at the various districts of the city. Thanks to these instructions, we were able to negotiate the rail network with confidence to visit all over Tokyo. Don't be put off by the uphill walk from the station back to the hotel.

It was disappointing that WiFi is not available in the rooms, but is available in the lobby at no cost.The breakfast room is a long way from the rooms and breakfast itself is overpriced at $27, and nothing special. For example, the Western breakfast did not make eggs to order, and the bacon was cold and soggy. However, these shortcomings were made up to some extent by the staff's efficiency and helpfulness. The hotel's restaurants were nothing special, and were not really needed.

Hotel is a little dated BUT it is clean and staff are very helpful and friendly so I dont know what people complain about! The gardens surrounding the hotel are beautiful and peaceful, great for a stroll at night as its very pretty when the lights are on. We got a great deal and stayed in the Club Double Room which was clean, comfy and huge! Yes, not all rooms in Japan are small as so demonstrated here at the GPNT. Staying on the Club Floor meant we could access the Club Lounge so we got breakfast in the morning and snacks and drinks (juice, soft drink, beer etc) from there all day long. The lady in charge of the Club Lounge was extra helpful - I had an adaptor BUT it was a 3 prong one and all the outlets in our room & the lounge were all 2 prong outlets so she tracked down a 2 prong outlet for us which we were very thankful for as my laptop needed charging. Room had free wired internet and wifi was only accessible in the lobby which was nice to sit to people watch. Bathroom was big and clean, shower was hot & had good pressure (which is important to me). We had a view of the Tokyo Tower which we enjoyed looking at from our balcony. Bed was HUGE and very comfy. Problem was the pillows. Like pretty much all the hotels we stayed in in Japan, they were very hard so gave me neck pains and headaches (one side is traditional Japanese pillow of buckwheat and the other side of the pillow is hard rubbery ""western"" style)Plenty of restaurants in the hotel and all around the hotel. Like all train stations in Japan, it has lots of places to eat and theres a shopping complex opposite the train station that has many more restaurants. On the walk back to the hotel from the train station, there is a an Outback Steakhouse (yummy!), TGI Fridays and and many more. We caught the train to Haneda International Airport from here which was quick, cheap and easy to do so there is no need to take a shuttle bus or taxi there. We would recommend to others to stay here as its lovely and great vallue for money.Word of advice - take a taxi from the train station as the hotel is up a hill and its a trek when you have luggage. Taxi is only about $7 (and make sure you specify The Grand Prince New Takanawa as there are 4 Prince Hotels next to each other) Also, staff are friendly but strict - we had a flight at 11pm and asked if we could check out a little later than the checkout time (which we were confused as to what it was - in the room info file it said 12noon and desk said it was 11am). We only wanted to check out at 1pm (as we thought it was noon) BUT were firmly but friendly told ""no, checkout is 11am"". We left our bags there so we could explore more of Tokyo for some hours.AND for those with dogs, this is a dog friendly hotel.

You walk into an enormous lobby, and there are about a million rooms. Possibly more. It's part of a larger complex with some other Prince hotels too: keep a note of the exact name so you don't end up in the wrong place.We stayed as part of a family holiday during which we stayed in three hotels in Tokyo and one in Kyoto. This was a large hotel that looks to be set up mainly for conferences and businesspeople, although as we were there during the week between Christmas and New Year, it was a lot less businessy than I suspect it usually is. In spite of the size, service wasn't impersonal or unfriendly: all of the staff went out of their way to be helpful. Check-in and check-out were surprisingly fast and easy given the very large number of guests. We had asked for two interconnecting rooms, but the hotel doesn't have any. Instead, we got two double rooms. Both were large, clean, comfortable, and had loads of storage space. The outside of the hotel looks a bit 70s, but our rooms were extremely modern: they seem to have been very recently renovated. The beds were very comfortable. My only real criticism of the rooms would be that they were far too warm. Even though it was late December, I had to keep my window open. We couldn't do that in the kids' room, though - it was a full-length sliding door onto a balcony, and it wouldn't have been safe. There was free, fast, wired Internet. There was a reasonably big TV with CNN and BBC. The location is great: it's about five minutes' walk from the Takenawa exit of Shinagawa Station. The bullet trains to and from Kyoto and Osaka stop there: if you're travelling to the hotel from another city, get off the bullet train at Shinagawa station rather than Tokyo station. There was a 7-11 convenience store on the ground floor, and an ATM that took a full range of international cards (something of a rarity in Japan): both of these things were incredibly helpful. This was a high-quality, no-nonsense, business-focused hotel.

You can get to pretty much anywhere in the city from the nearest Shinagawa station. Very convenient if you are arriving into Haneda Airport, taking only a 15 minute train ride on the Keikyu line. The hotel is a 5 minute uphill trek from the station. If you are arriving with more than a hand-luggage or luggage with no wheels, spend the $9 (minimum fare) and take a taxi. You will arrive in the hotel less exhausted. The hotel has a bus service but runs very infrequently, like once every 30 minutes.Must have been a grand hotel in its heydays but is now quite faded. The service is professional and courteous, but not personal. Everything works for the larger average, but not necessarily with your convenience in mind. One feature of the hotel is the beautiful Japanese Garden in the back, part of the larger Prince property of 3 hotels. Definitely worth a walk around it.A typical Japanese business hotel where you get a clean room and that's it. The room I had must have been updated sometime in the last 1-2 years. The room has a small balcony that looks over the neighbourhood buildings. The most frustrating experience was the temperature setting in the room. When I checked in, the room was at a smoking 28 degrees on the thermostat. It was some 12 degrees outside. After attempting many times to set it down to a more comfortable 24 degrees I called the front desk to get some help. The person on the other end repeatedly told me that as it is winter only the heater would work and I cannot use the cooler (!!!!!). Now, this was my plight when I was speaking to the guy in Japanese. After a few attempts explaining to him that I want to use the heater with a lower setting, I was politely told that the temperature cannot be adjusted in the room and if it is too hot, I can turn it off (!!!!!!). Even after turning off the thing, I had to leave my windows (thank god they could be opened) open most of the time. So, I had to use the windows as a manual thermostat throughout my 5-night stay :-(. I was reminded of a cheap hotel I once stayed in Sapporo back in 1995. At least in that hotel they did not claim that they provide air-conditioned rooms and did not have a dummy thermostat in the room. I remember sleeping with my window loosely shut all night, when the outside temperature was sub-zero.If you can afford a few dollars more, stay at the Prince Sakura Tower next door. The rooms are larger and nicer. I have stayed there a number of times and the air-conditioning works. If you cannot afford the dollars, go for a smaller 2 or 3 star hotel. You probably will get better value for money as you won't be paying for the name and features that really are not delivered or don't add real value.","Tokyo, Japan","Hiyer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",49,2.0

Located next to Shinagawa station, in the Minato-ku southern district of Tokyo it does not give you immediate access to the main Tokyo sightseeing locations (I have chosen the locations for business reasons), but with the Yamanote line you can get virtually anywhere in Tokyo relatively easy. There is Narita express train going from Narita airport to Shinagawa station and then it is about a 10 minute walk uphill to the hotel if you choose the West exit of the station. Altogether, a very easy, non-complicated journey from the airport.As some of the reviewers already noted, it is not that easy to figure out which of Prince Takanawa hotels you are going to stay in, I was sure I made a booking for Grand Prince Takanawa, but it turned out it was Prince Takanawa New. The receptionist and hostess girl were very helpful nevertheless and accompanied me to the entrance of the New Takanawa hotel though the beautiful Japanese garden, as well as brought my luggage there. The parcel that I sent for myself in advance to the 'old' Takanawa hotel was promptly brought to the New Takanawa and given to me right away at check in even before I asked for it. Check in was no thrills, and they ask for smoking/non-smoking room preference. The lobby of the hotel is huge and looks like a business center, but inside the room gives an impression of old Japan of the 50s. At least the furniture is in this style, but it does not look dated or too old and everything is perfectly functional. A nice balcony with a view to bamboo garden is a plus. There are yukata sleeping kimonos provided and a tea kettle (that warms up the water and keeps it warm while plugged) and a nice complimentary tea set with green and black teas that they replenish every day. There is a mini-fridge (useful, when you get something to eat for breakfast the night before).The bathroom is small, but everything functions perfectly. There is only cable internet in the room, the speed is quite fast.The room is clean and they offer an option of skipping the daily cleaning if you wish in return for the bonuses in their spa. It is very quiet on the floor and I heard no noise during neither day or night.Check out was also no thrills and they kept my bags for extra 5 hours free of charge. On the way to Shinagawa station and next to both exits of the station there are shops, japanese and other restaurants, supermarkets etc. At every floor there are vending machines with water, tea and other soft drinks. Drinking water is provided every day in the kettle.Altogether it was a very pleasant no-thrills stay and I very much recommend this hotel if you are looking for something in Minato area.","St. Petersburg, Russia","MashaTrofimoff</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Petersburg, Russia</strong>",43,5.0

This was not an acceptable room at any price, and it was not inexpensive. Worst of all, when I expressed my dissatisfaction to the hotel in their survey, their response was only to recommend that I come back in the spring after they remodel.

We chose this hotel because the rooms appeared to be a bit larger than typical sized rooms in Tokyo and we are glad we did. The ""Airport Limousine"" bus from Narita dropped us right off at the hotel (3000 yen pp). So convenient! Upon arrival, a friendly female hotel employee whisked our luggage onto a cart while we checked in then escorted us to our room, refusing to take the tip we offered her. We later learned that Japan has a non-tip culture! I think we booked a ""deluxe king"" on Expedia but when we checked in, the front desk staff informed us they had upgraded us to superior on the 15th floor which is the ""Club floor"" but without the club privileges. The room was a comfortable size (considerably larger than the Sunroute Plaza Shinjuku Hotel we stayed at our last night which is small but less expensive which I would also recommend - see separate review). The room had two chairs, a safe and a little balcony which was really nice to step out onto for fresh air and take in the view of Tokyo and the gardens below. We even tended to leave our balcony door open while in the room for fresh air. A tea and coffee station were provided, along with a stocked fridge of beer/cold drinks (for a cost of course) which allowed enough room for us to put a few things into. His and her PJ's were provided! The bed and pillows were sooooo comfortable with nice crisp white linens/comfy duvet. The bathroom provided an abundance of complimentary amenities and the shower was awesome!This is a great hotel to make as a ""home base"" while travelling in Tokyo. Nearby Shinagawa train station is an easy 5 minute walk and is a hub where you can take a train to virtually anywhere in Tokyo from. I wouldn't be concerned by some of the comments made on TA about ""the hill"". I had injured my knee prior to our holiday, and although it was bothering me, I had no problem walking to and from the station. Likewise, I would disregard any complaints people have made about the large convention centre like lobby in the hotel. It's fine. We never dined at the restaurants in the hotel but instead ate at a number of places in and around the large shopping mall across the street from the train station which we liked. (There are also a lot of restaurants on route from the hotel to the station including an Outback Steakhouse!). We frequented the little supermarket at the train station to purchase yogurt, fruit and cold drinks for breakfast and beer and wine for our room. There are tons of shops in the train station including an amazing french pastry shop (Anderson's?) which has pastries to die for!Upon checkout, we took the free hotel shuttle to the station with all our luggage to continue on with our travels. If you were leaving the Prince to return directly to Narita, the hotel would make a reservation for you on the Airport Limousine bus. Departure times are posted in the lobby.I would highly recommend this hotel and if I were to return to Tokyo, would definitely consider staying here again.","St. Catharines, Canada","BahiaDelray</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Catharines, Canada</strong>",786,4.0

This is a business-person's hotel The staff tried hard at being efficient however I felt that they were hamstrung by onerous rules placed upon them by management. The main hotel entry leads one into a cavernous area devoid of any ambience and effectively reminds you of entering a Russian State mausoleum. (Sorry Russia, no disrespect). Apart from one large mural on the long hallway, this hotel could have been placed anywhere in the world. In this bleak partially lit cavern you will find lots of chairs for your benefit whilst waiting for the airport limo or taxi or tour busses, but not in anyway personal. As for the ""lounge coffee/bar service"" in this area, I went there on one occasion at 1:15pm to get some sandwiches only to be informed that they had sold out - OK fair enough I thought, so I asked as to how long before they were able to make up some more (lots of people milling around) the answer - ""oh, so sorry Sir, once sold out, that is it!""To be fair, the location of the hotel was reasonably convenient (in a manner), however, should you wish to visit the more vibrant areas, a train or cab trip was needed at all times. The hotel is located just a block from Shinagawa train station, it was easy to take the train to anywhere in Tokyo (on the JR Line - be careful on the trains as several operators and the passes aren't always transferable). Lots of reasonably priced eateries in and around the station, great food located in the supermarket just adjacent to the station (take the escalator down one floor, you will be amazed!). Preferred these to the pricey hotel restaurants. If you are travelling for business, this would be an appropriate hotel. For the vacationers among you, I would choose something far smaller and more intimate. Also, if you want English-speaking TV, choose a room above the 6th floor. We stayed here 5 nights. As for the Club Floor Level - FORGET IT (sorry to shout) this would be the most disgraceful attempt at a club floor that I have ever seen in over 30 years of business travel. The rooms are on the highest two floors, however that is were it ends. No extra service of any description, no wine or nibbles after 5pm, as for breakfast - coco pops and white bread for toast only! Oh, want a swim in the pool? Then only come on the weekend! Also they may close the pool area if they deem it to be too hot. We were a bunch of sun loving Australians and to have our water access cut was like loosing a limb! Also, guess what, as a guest in the hotel you still have to pay for the privilege of using the pool! Like a work out in the gym - same deal for guests, pay, pay, pay. Feel like a drink after a lazy Sunday afternoon, well don't go to the bar in this hotel - it is closed Sunday and Monday's!In nutshell would I return to this hotel - no way! For the price of a club floor room and expected extra services, it was a non event.

If you are arriving from Narita airport, head over to the airport's JR service counter and ask for a NEX/Suica pass (5000 yen per person). This pass offers a two-way airport transfer via the NEX train (just as comfy as a bullet train, but not as speedy) plus a Suica JR train card with 2000 yen credit for you to explore Tokyo. The NEX stops at Shinagawa station, where you can take the free hotel shuttle bus (one bus every half hour) from the station's main exit. Compared to taking a limousine bus (3000 yen one way), you can save about 3000 yen in all.Mirroring my previous trip, I booked a Superior Room with the hotel again this time, and was very happy to find, upon check-in, that I was given a room on the Club Floor. While the Club room featured slightly more luxurious rooms compared to the regular Superior, the experience was mostly the same - it's a really comfortable, beautifully designed space. Rooms also feature a small balcony where you can walk out to take in the fresh air, a very nice and classy addition that I have yet to encounter at any other hotel in Japan thus far.While the room is not exceptionally large, it is still generous by Japanese hotel standards, and there is definitely more than enough space for two people. However, the wardrobe is a little small, and it might be a but of a squeeze especially if you are sharing a room with someone, or when you are lugging along heavy, bulky winter clothes.The service at this hotel is good, almost all the staff speak very good English and are exceptionally helpful and friendly. There was one afternoon when I locked myself out of my room, but the lady at the guest relations counter was able to help me get out of my predicament very quickly. I had also gotten ready assistance from both the front desk staff and guest relations staff for receiving and sending mail during my stay. When I lacked a large enough envelope for my items, a staff member readily provided me with one at no extra charge.Shinagawa is located in the south of Tokyo, making it quite an ideal place to set off from especially if you would like to shop. Traveling time by JR train (Yamanote Line) to both the glitzy Ginza shopping district and the trendy Shibuya/Shinjuku area are an equal 15 minutes in different directions. For families with children, or for the child at heart, the Tokyo Pokemon Center is at Hamamatsucho, about 10 minutes away by JR train.The only gripe I have is that the hotel's shuttle bus ends in the early evening, at about 8 pm or so. Once the bus service ends, you'll have to make your way to the hotel yourself. While this road is brightly lit and never quiet, the uphill climb can be pretty tiring especially if you're lugging lots of shopping bags, or when the weather gets very warm in the summer. While this short hike will take you about 10 to 15 minutes at most, there are always cafes, restaurants, and even vending machines along the way up should you need to stop and take a break.",Singapore,"josada</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",78,5.0

The 'superior' room was large (by Tokyo standards) and overall very comfortable. As small balcony afforded some fresh air and views. No wi-fi in the room, only (free) hardwire internet.The hotel is 5-10 mins walk directly up a gentle hill from the surface rail station and about 15 min walk in the opposite direction to the metro. Pretty convenient although you might struggle to find the hotel from the metro the first time without good directions.There is a bus service to both airports from the hotel costing about the same as Narita Express train. The actual journey takes a bit longer but by the time you walk to the station, wait on the platform and maybe transfer at Tokyo station, the bus would be the more convenient option.Overall a good, convenient to stay in Tokyo and the price reflects that you are not right downtown.","Melbourne, Australia","Michael076</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",187,4.0

The rooms were bigger than the average Japanese hotel room and very nicely furnished, although clothes storage is always a bit of an issue in Japanese hotel rooms and this was no exception. The beds were marvellous; we didn't investigate but they appeared to have memory foam mattress toppers on, and were really blissfully comfortable to us Western softies, and we all slept extremely well every night. They have a scheme whereby you can decline to have your bedlinen and towels changed and they give you a 500 yen voucher to spend in the shops for each day you do this. We didn't opt for it, but it's not a bad idea. The little 7-11 convenience store in the hotel was really good and the prices were modest; we bought breakfast materials there rather than spending £20 per head in the coffee shop. The lobby is vast, like an airport lounge, and the hotel is busy and bustling all the time, but the staff are extremely helpful and English is spoken. Luggage storage before checkin and after checkout was no difficulty, the airport limousine bus calls at the hotel and tickets for it can be bought directly from the bell desk. The hotel is a 5-minute walk from Shinagawa station and in a complex surrounded by other Prince hotels, with access to their guest facilities. There are various restaurants around, and a nice Chinese eating place on the station frontage, plus a handy food court in the Shinagawa Prince hotel shopping complex just down the hill, with sensible prices and a variety of outlets where you can get soba, ramen, takoyaki, okonomiyaki, pizza, katsu and other fast food. All in all it was an excellent base for exploring Tokyo, using our JR passes on the Yamanote line from JR Shinagawa station. And we got an excellent deal (buy 4 nights save 40%) which meant we paid a remarkably low price. We would very happily return to this hotel.","Darlington, England","Mnemosyne</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Darlington, England</strong>",28,5.0

Make sure you know the exact address of the hotel as there are a few in the same area with similar names. We chose a room on the club floor, which I am glad we did. Walking on some of the non club floors the corridors looked a bit dated and run down, certainly frayed round the edges. Not sure what the rooms inside were like, but if the outside were anything to go by.Club rooms were a reasonable size with King bed and seating/desk area. Bathrooms were not big but adequate. The balcony was great and allowed good views of the Tokyo skyline.There was a club lounge for these rooms. This was only open from 2pm to 8pm where hot drinks were complimentary. There were cold drinks in a fridge, which included beers. At around 5pm they got out a bottle of whiskey. It was the same bottle they got out during my stay. If you like other alcoholic drinks to that bottle of whiskey and beer you are out of luck. There were a few snacks, but the selection was limited. This club room could do with a breakfast service and a better service throughout the day. In the 5 nights I was there I only saw one other person using the room. It would also benefit from having computers and printers/copiers to use. There is a business centre, which is chargeable by putting coins into the slot, where you can use the internet and print things off. Getting things off the printer is quite a task in itself, you might need to go headhunting at NASA to get someone to help you. I eventually managed to get what I wanted printed but I think it was more luck than good mangagement.The plus side of this hotel is the convenience store which sells food and drinks at a fraction of the price from room service or your mini bar. There is also a good shuttle bus that takes you to Haneda and Narita airports (two separate buses). There is a shuttle bus down to Shinagawa train station but its only a 5 minute walk and not really worth it. On the walk down there are a few eating options as well as at Shinagawa station.Enjoyed my stay here, but I think the rooms need updating.

The other hotels in he complex are the Prince Sakura Tower and the Grand Prince Takanawa (be careful when you make a booking as the names are very similar. This is a very large hotel, huge but rather spartan lobby, adjacent conference centre, floors up to 6 are standard and not worth staying in for the price in my opinion. Floors 7-14 are superior, floors 15-16 are the Club rooms. The Club lounge is only open 2-8pm, has a few snacks, tea and coffee and cold drinks, TV and Wi-Fi. Unfortunately not open for breakfast even though the hotel room compendium states this is open from 7am-10pm. There is also an on site convenience store and a ATM machine.Try and get a room facing North towards Tokyo Tower for the best night view. There are small curved balconies for fresh air. The club executive rooms are spacious with a lounge, 2 large 50 inch flat screen TVs, large bathroom with double sink and walk in shower and a bath. There is also a desk,  comfy chair and 2 seater settee. Free bottled water available.Breakfast for ¥2500 at Marmolada Restaurant or you can also go to Patio Grand Cafe in the Grand Prince Takanawa (nice walk through the Japanese garden - if it's raining, just ask the Bell Captain for an umbrellla.  Or there is Japanese breakfast at the Prince Sakura. You can go to any of the 3 restaurants for breakfast as they all are part of the same complex, just show your room card. For my money the Patio Grand is nicer and less crowded. Wired Internet is free in the room but wi-fi costs ¥1000 per stay, so the longer you stay the cheaper it becomes. We had 2 adjoining rooms and only paid the fee for 1 room as we could get connection through the wall.Access to Shinagawa station is via 10 min walk downhill or a 15 min walk uphill coming back with all your shopping. There is a free shuttle bus that picks you up outside the station, 1st pickup is 8. 10am then half hourly, eg 8. 40, 9. 10 ... then 13. 10, 13.30, 14.00 ... 21.00. If you have a JR rail pass you can get on the JR Yamanote line for free by showing your pass to the guard at the barrier. Alternatively you can buy a Suica card at the station and load this up. This can also be used on the subway and at some shops.Overall this is a good but very large business and conference hotel. Shinagawa station is one of the major stops on the Shinkansen train route and has the benefit that is smaller than Shinjuku and Tokyo stations and also has only 2 exits (most people go out the west exit). Tip- upgrade your room if you can afford it. PS: You can claim a tax refund of 5% at major department stores as well as Tokyu Hands and the Loft if you spend more than ¥10501 at the same store on the same day. Bring your passport and receipts to the tax refund counter (usually on the top floor or the basement floor) and they will give you your refund in cash as well as attaching your refund receipt to your passport which is taken off at customs. The good thing is that you can buy several small items as long as the total is over ¥10501 and you do not have to show the items to Customs as you do in Australia.",Auckland,"mirroden</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland</strong>",72,4.0

Sadly, the miniature 1950's furnishings and RV like walls are still here! Perhaps, they have renovated some of the rooms, but not mine. The service continues to be excellent, the size of the rooms for Tokyo is very nice, the common areas have been updated, the proximity to Shinegawa Station and international cuisine is extremely convenient and I love the setting with the beautiful trees and garden.

The club rooms include use of the club lounge, continental breakfast, drinks all day (till 9pm, which is when the club lounge closed), and free high speed internet in the bedroom. For us, the free internet and drinks were what made these rooms worthwhile (there is internet in the regular rooms, but it is not free). However, without the deal price, I do not believe that the club room prices are worth their normally high price.Our room (and all those on the side of the hotel looking out over the garden) had a nice little balcony, and the room facilities were excellent. Staff were very fast and helpful with anything we needed. We had a large twin room, with 2 huge beds - both at least Queen size. Fabulously comfortable, and very conducive to jet-lagged over-sleeping on our 2nd and 3rd days, when it finally hit :-)The proximity to Shinagawa railway station and to the Takanawa metro station are very useful. When arriving at Shinagawa, try to take the hotel shuttle back to the hotel, as the walk uphill to the hotel can be quite rough, especially if you have luggage, shopping, or are at the end of a long day of sightseeing. The last shuttle (at least when we were there) leaves the station at 9pm. The walk to Shinagawa is all downhill, and since we did it only in the mornings when we were fresh, it is quite ok. If you want to take the shuttle from the hotel, you need to book it in advance - for the morning trips, do so the day before.The hotel does not have a spa, but you can use the spa at their sister hotel across the garden (the Grand Prince Sakura, I think it's called). You have to check in there at least 1 hour before they close, and we never got back in time to do that (plus we didn't have the strength to walk over, after a long day out in the city).There is an outdoor swimming pool, but it was closed while we were there - low season. From our room it didn't look terribly clean, so I hope they clean it out before opening it up to guests.

I would say that this is one of my most memorable trips I ever had, and the success of this trip is largely contributed by the excellent service of this hotel. Since we don't know how to speak Japanese and we don't know how to travel around, the guest officers were very helpful. They were so patient and they really tried their best to make us understand. They provide step by step instruction on how to go to one place to another. I also appreciate the free shuttle going to Disneyland and DisneySea. Since going to such parks requires a lot of walking, I can't imagine taking the train after a long day at the park.My only complaint with this hotel is during our first 2 days, the towels smelled bad like they weren't cleaned.

So in appreciation of others that took the time and effort plus I would like to give my due praise to this hotel for their outstanding service and help. We stayed at this hotel for a week during our Tokyo trip due mainly to its good neighborhood accreditation which means it has a free shuttle to Disneyland/Disneysea theme park. We went to Disneyland/DisneySea for 3 days of our 6 days trip. I book the hotel via Expdia and we got a decent price of $134/night. We had a king size bed which we requested and the room has a good size for a Tokyo hotel. All rooms have a balcony I think. We were staying at the 12th floor. I do believe that the rooms below the 8th or 7th floors were older and not fully renovated yet. Our room were modern with flat screen TV, complete ammenities such as slippers, towels, shampoo conditioner, liquid bath soap, razor, comb, cotton buds etc. The toilet is heated with bidets. There were 3 of us with a 3 year old child and we felt that the room has ample space for our kid to play as well. The best thing I would say with this hotel is that the service given by the Guest officer is very good. Everyday we will ask them where they would recommend for us to visit, and they will give us every detail including which trains to take, which platform and even the prices were accurate. There is no free wifi in the rooms and the wifi in the lobby has a fee so we use the free internet at their business center. This is a bit of a down side to this hotel. But it is still free so that's ok I guess. The major inconvenience for this hotel is that it is about 5-7 mins of an uphill walk coming back from the shinagawa station. Most of the restaurants, and groceries, newsday stores are in the shinagawa station and it is a hassle to walk there and carry some heavy water and snacks going uphill back to the hotel. Plus having a 3 year old is a bit of a hassle after coming from a busy day of touring around then having to walk uphill back to the hotel. They do have a free shuttle that goes to the hotel but on a certain time period only so we never really timed the free ride. Anyway, the major reason why we book this hotel was because for the price and the location (a minor sacrifice) we have a free shuttle to disneyland we decided to go with this hotel. If we will be touring disneyland for more than 3 days we would have opted to stay in any of the nearby Disney Resort hotel however, we also want to visit some other nearby cities in Tokyo so we decided to stay in this area. We also spend half a day at an Aquarium nearby the hotel and this was really appreciated by my kid. Although they spoke mainly Japanese but seeing lots of fish and stingrays, sharks and dolphin show it was enough for my kid to enjoy the day. Also, I would like to add that they have an incentive for a non-cleaning day they offer to give you Y1000 rebate which we used in their bakery for breakfast. The breads there are great and priced at around Y200 per piece. However they don't allow you to have a successive days of non-cleaning. Only alternate days are allowed. I would rate this hotel as a 3.5 * to borderline 4* hotel. The lobby and coffee shop is quite large but it feels very lonely. They have a nice garden as well...",vancouver,"tripnfoods</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>vancouver</strong>",1,4.0

Since we stayed 4 nights, I got a special rate at Expedia and so was unsure of the room we would get. When we got there, the staff was very helpful and friendly and told us our room had been upgraded. Which I believe it meant that instead of getting the old rooms, we got a newly renovated one. It had two queen beds and ample bathroom, a desk/sitting area and a small balcony. The hotel has a several restaurants; we tried only the cafe which had a reasonably priced breakfast (around US$8) and the Japanese restaurant which was good and as any hotel restaurant, over priced. The hotel gives you the choice to opt-out of having your linens changed and gives you a voucher for the restaurants (around US$10). You can only do this every other day. They give you the daily newspaper in English or Japanese, and the toilettries include evrything form hair brush to shaving cream. Since the hotel is part of a complex of Grand prince hotels, guests have access to all of the hotels and internet facilities. The one at New Takanawa has staff on hand to help you with your needs but closes at 10PM. The other ones are 24 hours but there's no one to assist you. Internet, printing, and fax services are provided free of charge. The central garden surrounded by the hotels is really beautiful, so much that my Japanese friends tell me they come to visit it when seasons change. We were in full cherry blossom season and it was amazing.Location wise- I would say it is not right next to transportation but I believe other reviewers exaggerate the distance. It is only a 5 min walk to Shinagawa train station, perfect if you're traveling to Kyoto and surroundings. If you're healthy and young the walk is really nothing, there is a bit of a slope but nothing major. There is also a shuttle bus to the train station and you have to reserve it. We took it only on the day we checked out and had our luggage with us. It is also a 5-minute walk to the Takanawadai subway station. We used this option frequently because we had a two day metro pass and there are no slopes here.Regarding the renovations, we noticed that the lower floors up to the 7th floor have not been renovate since the 80's (judging by the Miami Vice colors) so your experience may be quite different if you're assigned to one of these rooms.","Toronto, Canada","bruixita</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",41,4.0

A wonderful place to stay and one I would readily recommend to other travelers (with 1 minor exception). I will review by section:-- Staff: The staff at the Grand Prince Hotel New Takanawa (henceforth referred to as 'New Takanawa') are top notch! Professional, courteous, friendly, knowledgeable and very eager to assist. From bell service to room service, I was absolutely pleased with the staff. Even though my wife and I did not speak Japanese (outside of a few common phrases), the language barrier wasn't a significant issue and there was always someone who had enough of a command of the English language to take care of our needs. Special mention goes to the concierge staff that went out of their way to assist us in getting around Tokyo.-- Room Quality: Very good room quality with standard features I expect from a nice hotel: Flat screen TV, large bed, room safe, desk, etc... The rooms are smaller than Western hotel rooms (and this was to be expected), but this does not diminish the comfort or quality I expected or experienced. I found the carpeting, drapes/curtains and walls to be new and recently renovated. There was nothing that was gaudy, run down or cheap in appearance (to the contrary, the rooms looked quite modern, even elegant). There were also a lot of little ""nice touches"": Although there was a mini-bar (avoid!), they provided 4 bottled waters every day - Free! A free English newspaper was provided every day. The rooms have doorbells. The balconies are very nice and afford good views of the city. -- Bathrooms: Although small, the bathrooms were fantastic! Hot/Cold running water, shower and sink. Every day, toiletries exceeded hotel standards (including daily toothbrush/toothpaste, travel kit and travel hairbrush). The toilets are amazing - best ever experienced in a hotel - Eastern or Western: Warmed seats, scented and came with a variety of added functions (bidet, mist, etc...). If you use the toilets in the club level, the lid will automatically open for you. Nifty!-- Club Level: I would recommend paying a little extra to have access to the club level. The club level gives one access to reserved check-in/check-out and hotel services. There was an excellent continental breakfast in the mornings and in the afternoon/evening, free snacks and drinks (including alcohol). A very good place to warm-up before, and unwind after, a long day of exploring.-- Location: The location is a double-edged sword and requires more detailed information. The Pros and Cons:Location Pros: The area of Shinagawa is a good general ""launching point"" for travelers as it is near the Shinagawa Station (a major hub with access to the JR Yamanote Line: A line that takes you to most of the major areas of the city). If you are looking to explore the city or need to be located near a major transportation hub, then Shinagawa is a very good area to stay.Location Cons: While the New Takanawa is within walking distance of Shinagawa Station (about 5-10 minutes), from the station to the hotel, it is uphill (a minor incline). For me, this wasn't a problem. For my pregnant wife who was tired after a long day of exploring, it was a problem. Elderly or people who have trouble with mobility may find this to be an issue. -- Business Center: The hotel has a business center with high-speed internet access. There was no additional charge for this service (always a plus). It was in a small, open area that afforded no privacy. There was a limited number of computers, so you may have to wait. But this is more than adequate if all you want to do is print airline boarding passes, online RSVPs, online maps and directions, etc... It served my modest needs.-- Restaurants and Room Service: There are several restaurants at the New Takanawa, but to be honest, for the price and quality, they really aren't all that special. Don't get me wrong: The food and quality are good (not great), but one would really be better off dining in the city for the price, quality and experience. I found room service to be speedy, but once again, average - not exceptional. My advice: Leave the hotel. Explore Tokyo. Enjoy the local cuisine.Before closing, I would like to dispel a big rumor I've read about concerning this hotel: Renovation. Prior to my visit, there were a lot of rumors/reports is that there was a lot of renovation going on and there are many areas that were not yet renovated. Fact: The reality is that all hotels undergo renovation from time to time. However, during the time my wife and I were there, we did not see any active renovation occurring. The hallways, elevators, public areas, shops and restaurants all looked modern and clean. Our room looked also looked clean, elegant and new.Conclusion: The Grand Prince Hotel New Takanawa is a wonderful place to stay while in Tokyo with exceptional staff, fantastic rooms, wonderful service and good location. For a seasoned or savvy traveler, this is an excellent place to stay and I wholeheartedly recommend it.","Wake Forest, North Carolina","Esper</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wake Forest, North Carolina</strong>",21,4.0

We being my friend and her 7 and 9 year olds and myself and my 10 and 13 year old. we had next door rooms on the 12th floor with views out to the tokyo tower. each room was spacious, extremely clean and had a very very comfy king size bed, plenty room for each family to sleep. the bathroom was also spacious with plenty of supplies, don't worry about taking shampoo, conditioner or shower gel, as all these are refilled when ever the room is serviced. the hotel do a wonderful thing, they have a green scheme where by you nominate to not have your room serviced or towels/bedding changed and they give you a voucher for 1000yen to spend at the hotel. you can only do this every other day and they still come in and empty your bins for you. we did this evey other day, the 1000 yen allowed us to purchase breaky from the bread shop below the lobby , with the best pizza bread i have ever eaten and the best chocolate croissants according to my daughter. most of the items in this little shop are around 180-200 yen each. thats the only place we purchased food from in the hotel, every day for breaky and to buy extras for our morning tea on day trips. there is a little convienince store in the hotel , its open late so purchase you drinks from there and your juice for in a morning , it dosnt open until 8am , that was too late as most days we were out by then. on that note , most of tokyo does not open until 10 or 11 am as the shops don't close until 9 or 10pm. we caught the limosine bus from narita direct to the hotel and had it pick us up for our return transfere, a much easier option than the train , especially with kids.this hotel also has the free disney bus , which needs to be booked in advance, we booked the first one in the morning and was to return the last one at night , but it was freezing, snowing actually , so we got back to the bus stop early and the earlier bus had room to fit us on.most of the tokyo tours also do a hotel pick up from here. very handy for those early starts.the hotel is about 5 min walk from shinagawa station , the hotel also has a free shuttle down to the station if you pre book. we used the jr train line one day and found it very easy, we purchased a daily discount ticket to hop on and off when ever. the train people are also very very helpful and will do there best to get you to where you want to get too. that day we visitied the pokemon centre( huge shop selling everything pokemon) imperial gardens, ginza and harajuku ( a heaven for any girls aged 8 to ?). the following day we had a day on the subway , a 5 minute wlak in the opposite direction from the hotel. equally as easy to use, that day we visited tsjinku fish market ( a brilliant experince for all ages) and ate the freshest sashimi i have ever had, senso ji tempel and akasuka where we spent many hours looking around the stalls and little shops.more onto the hotel , the staff were very accomodating and helpful, they made you feel very important. this hotel is not in a nightlife district , but after a very full day sightseeing thats not what we wanted. it ticked all the boxes for a family stay, we felt very safe here. on a last note, therres this little japanese restaurant right out the front of the shinagawa station that sells reasonably priced food not too dear, but also sells pancakes , great fort he kids and theres a macdonalds accross the road from the station too along with a great 7eleven store for snacks and drinks.","BRISBANE, QLD, AUSTRALIA","QUEEN_OF_CATS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>BRISBANE, QLD, AUSTRALIA</strong>",33,5.0

The hotel was spruced up with anything and everything about cherryblossoms. The Prince chain of hotels pride itself of its gardens, which is so huge, it would be a shame to not explore. It would already provide you a glimpse of Japan. Since its has a small temple, a japanese bridge, a pond with tons of huge koi fishes, and ofcourse cherryblossom trees.The staff of the hotel were friendly, but some do not really speak good english. The hotel lobby is by far one of the biggest i've seen. Good sitting area, especially if you're waiting for your tour group or friends. Breakfast is included w/ the package, and you have 3 restaurants to choose from (western, asian and japanese). We didnt try the japanese breakfast though, but we have a feeling that they would server a similar fare.The room is quite small, the bed is very low, i've heard a couple of guests complaining about the pillow. The bathroom is also small, sink is also low. But it comes with complimentary toiletries and towels. Interesting to note that the toilet bowl is very high tech. The room is quite shabby and outdated. Each rooms on our floor has a fence before the door. I suggest you get a room on the club or upper floors to provide a better view of the city. But you cant complain about the staff, they were all very friendly even if you have to do hand signals to communicate.The hotel is located near the Shinagawa station, which has an isetan dept store and other stores inside. There are a couple of nearby restaurants and convenient stores as well. The hotel is also part of the friendly neighborhood disney hotel, so there are free trips to and from Tokyo Disneyland.Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone who's not fussy with their rooms but puts convenience and a good location as priority.

Reading the reviews here, I got concerned and requested they re-book a renovated room at a slightly higher tariff.As a result, our room was well appointed and average in size by international standards but large as Tokyo rooms go. They provided us with harder pillows as requested and had a convenient ice machine. On the scale of things, a clean and well re-decorated room within a tired shell of the main hotel; it was apparent from other floors that old wallpaper and tired carpets were still evident.One of four big hotels in the block, it is an uphill walk from Shinagawa station and dragging wheelie bags is less than pleasurable, but I guess catching a taxi for 600 metres is a luxury for some.The rest of the area had little to recommend to tourists, but the trains make it extremely easy to travel around.","Brisbane, Australia","TheQueenslander</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",128,3.0

There is great shopping in and around this hotel and the train station is just a little bit of a walk, about 1/4-1/2 mile down a slight hill. It is close to Tokyo Station (the major hub to other districts in Tokyo and not too far from the Imperial Palace), Shibuya (a wonderful shopping district), Harajuku (another WONDERFUL shopping district), Ginza (more shopping). These are the districts outside of Disney that we visited. The train system was very very easy to navigate from the Shinagawa train station.The hotel's staff were wonderful and we did not find it hard to communicate with anyone there. The room was very nice, clean, the shower and bathtub were fantastic! We received an Japanese newspaper written in english every morning. There were a couple of television stations on the t.v. that had english speaking news programs and we loved watching the Japanese t.v. programs.

The clientele appeared to be mainly Japanese businessmen, although there was a German tour group there as well. I don't think the hotel is used to Western tourists. English was barely serviceable.

The air conditioner didn't work--it apparently does not turn on unless the room temperature is 73 degrees or higher. Since it was very humid for several days, it resulted in fairly uncomfortable evenings.
