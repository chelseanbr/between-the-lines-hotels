The hotel is fine. The service is great. The rooms are clean, large enough and some have nice balconies. My problem is the resort fee. Which only gives you the location, nothing else except a small pool. There are better and less expensive alternatives around Wakiki, even for HHonors members. The location is probably the #1 plus as you don't need a car, with just a short walk to all that wakiki has to offer. But that also means you won't be using the 'facilities' at the hotel that much, hence the annoying high resort fee. For Diamond members, the 'free breakfast' is continental and very limited - fruit, cereal, yogurt, breads. The full 'hot' breakfast is an additional $9. (In addition to that resort fee! - And yes, there is a theme here.) But once again, you probably will be enjoying breakfast somewhere else - like McDonalds!Not Recommended unless the other alternatives are booked or are more expensive, but don't forget to factor in that Resort Fee!","Colorado Springs, Colorado","CharlesC918</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colorado Springs, Colorado</strong>",118,3.0

When we came back there was still no hot water.We woke up the next day 12/26/19 and there was still no hot water. We called again to the front desk and were told that they were aware of the situation and were trying to get the problem fixed. We left for the day. Upon our return there was still no hot water. We again called and said that they were working on the problem. The next morning 12/27/19 we woke up and there was still no hot water. We called again and were told it was being worked on. We asked to speak to a manager about the issue and were told they would call us. We gave our cell phone and was assured someone would call us. We did not receive a phone call from the manager. We went out and upon our return there was no message from the manager, no call, but at least the hot water was working.The next morning we again called to speak to a manager. One happened to be nearby so they put her on the phone. We explained the situation without any hot water and asked for compensation from the hotel for the lack of hot water. We were told they were not giving any compensation. We pressed a bit harder and were offered $50 for the complete stay as compensation. We asked for at least the resort fees and valet parking fees to be waived for the two days. We were told no. She then offered $100 for the complete stay and that was it. In addition to the water issue above, we were called early one morning by the front desk and informed that the maintenance guy was outside our door and needed to enter the room due to a leak. We got up and let the maintenance guy in to check for a leak, there was none, and he left. The climate control for the room was horrible. Either too hot or too cold, no happy medium. The carpet felt damp all the time, the windows fogged up, and the towels and linens felt damp and musty. We have stayed at other properties in Waikiki and did not experience similar issues. One night the elevator stopped working and they had to get someone to come and fix it. This is a busy hotel and even with 3 elevators it's barely enough. Losing one meant it took a long time to get an elevator to your room.The only way to park here is by valet parking at the rate of $40 per day. Way too high in my opinion. There is also a resort fee.The hospitality, or lack thereof, at this DoubleTree property does not live up to expectations. The hotel staff exhibit no customer service whatsoever. What happened to the Aloha spirit? The nicest person working in the hotel was the cleaning lady who at least greeted us each morning, and provided extra towels, albeit damp towels, when asked. As a Hilton Honors member that stays in a lot of DoubleTree properties this is by far the worst we have stayed in. It does not live up the brand, or the cost. For the price you will pay to stay here, I would encourage you to stay somewhere else.","San Leandro, California","GeneBoucher</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Leandro, California</strong>",2,1.0

This one, however, did not meet my expectations.Location: It's located in a funny place, half way between downtown Waikiki and Ala Moana center. You can argue that both are within walking distance, but for some people, both are not. The hotel is not located on major bus/trolley routes, and most tour companies does not pick you up at this hotel (you need to walk to a nearby hotel). Walking back from Waikiki at late night may be a bit concerning. Overall I think this hotel is less convenient than most other hotels in this area. There are multiple convenience stores nearby just like everywhere else at Waikiki.Facility: This is a very small hotel. One major benefit is you don't need to walk very far from your room to the street outside. You are also less likely to be buried by crowds. However, that also means this hotel has very limited facilities. There's only a small pool almost nobody uses, and a small gym. Making the resort fee feel extra expensive. They do offer an interesting benefit which allows you to rent movies using a machine at lobby level. They have some pretty new movies but you need to be able to find the machines first. This hotel has 19 floors, but only 3 small elevators. During busy hours people staying at lower floors may have trouble getting out. Also my room keys rarely worked. The staff gave me extra cards but then I had to carry multiple card with me because only some of them works at a given time.Room: The room was on the smaller side, but I can expect that in Waikiki. It felt a bit old and plain. But mostly OK. And I did appreciate the oversized TV. My standard room came with a balcony, but the bathroom was shower only. The city view was not bad. However one of Waikiki's main street is nearby so expect things like sirens. The water tasted a bit strange. It didn't make me sick but I certainly didn't like it.Members: If you are a gold/diamond member. This hotel doesn't want to please you. Room upgrade costs money. And you only get cold food for breakfast. Hot food costs extra. The restaurant is pretty small so I guess they just want to discourage people from using it.Overall speaking this hotel is not terribly bad (I'm more inclined to give it 2.5 stars instead of 2 if that's possible) However there are many other choices nearby, Hilton or not. And this hotel is not particularly cheap either. So I will certainly try a different hotel next time.","San Jose, California","Poorjar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",74,2.0

I have been a Hilton Diamond Member for years, and this has been my worst experience ever with any brand of hotel. I booked the stay using Hilton Honors points and it still cost me close to $900 with no food or beverage fees.First when we checked in I had noted that it was our anniversary, and they did recognize this. They offered us an upgraded room for an additional $75 a night. When it was pitched too us they said that this room has a full Ocean view and an oversized Jacuzzi. They also claimed that this room was 3 times larger than the room we had booked. The room did not have a fill ocean view. At best it was a partial or obscured ocean view. When going on the balcony you had to look to your right at least 45 degrees to see the ocean. The majority of the view was of the pools of multiple apartment buildings. The oversized jacuzzi was in the same footprint of a standard tub which made it much smaller because of all of the plumbing. It was impossible for either myself or my wife to get in the jacuzzi and fully extend our legs. The room did seam to be larger than a standard room, but they dropped a couch from the 80s that lumpy and the armrest had sags in the center. My college dorm couch was in better shape and much more comfortable. Breakfast was fine if you paid an additional amount, but if you wanted the included Diamond breakfast get ready for stale bread, bagels and muffins, ""not"" fresh fruit, and dry cereal. Don't get me started on the resort fee $30. This included a bunch of things that is already included as a Diamond member. Free water, premium internet towels at the pool free DVD rentals? My pool at home is bigger than this pool, but I guess you are not going to Hawaii to stay at a hotel pool, and free DVD rentals why when I and most everyone has Netflix etc. A resort fee should be reserved for a resort not a hotel 2 miles from the beach just trying to squeeze a few more bucks out of you.The staff as a whole was subpar, there were 2 individuals in the Valet staff, which is the only way to park at $40 a night, that were attentive and nice. During our stay I went to the desk and stated I had dinner reservations at a certain time so they could have the car in an accessible spot. They said we don't do that just come down when you are ready. If it was me in a customer service position even if this is something that you don't do, I would have replied something like thank you we will ensure to have your vehicle close so we can retrieve it as soon as your ready.I am currently debating never staying at a Hilton property again because of this one bad apple.",,Brian B,0,1.0

My work requires me to be away from home more than I’m there. But when I visit Oahu, the only place I will stay is the Doubletree in Waikiki because it feels like family. The rooms are nice and water is hot. This last visit I spent time after a long day of work and hiking and listened to the sounds of the city on my balcony. The beds and cookies from the front desk definitely are the highlights. I could fall asleep in seconds just laying on those heavenly pillows. Being able to sleep in a quiet room is unmeasurable. But the highlight of this hotel is the staff. Henry at the front desk welcomes you in. He and I share California residency knowledge and it’s nice to talk about home with someone who understands. He has a great smile and is quick to help with anything you need. I’ve only met him 1 time and yet it felt like we were old friends. And then there’s Qian. She is the epitome of what guest service should be. I was fortunate enough to have met her my first visit in July due to a small mistake which she quickly took action to fix and called me several times after to make sure I was happy with my stay. During my most recent visit, she remembered me and chatted with me even though she definitely had better things to take care of. She made sure everything was perfect this visit. I love hiking and she told me of a few different places to visit. She even remembered I’m from the 9th Island and that was such a small detail. I feel honored to have met such a kind person. All things considered. I always review the places I’m potentially going to be staying at online and without a doubt, the Double Tree is worth every penny. I can only tell you that it’s the place to stay when visiting Waikiki and feel like you’re seeing old friends. Thanks again Henry and Qian.",,LEGO_LeeG,0,5.0

Luckily we had a ton of tours planned so we were hardly at the hotel so it was manageable but I won’t be returning.The breakfast buffet was mediocre (they don’t do poached eggs) and the Hawaii hiking cafe downstairs was closed to host an AA meeting when we tried to enter. The rooms were average, the bathrooms had small showers that were elevated and despite our best efforts left huge puddles outside the glass door. The walls were thin so each morning I awoke to the conversation of the neighbors at 4:30 am. The sliding doors to the balcony were very difficult to open and close. Anyone in an adjacent balcony could be heard through your room as well. There is only valet parking, and no other parking options on the property.

I was determined this time not to make the same mistake.Because reviews tend to be highly subjective I believe it's best to temper expectations based on need and what you're willing to pay. I actually used points for this particular stay which allowed me to upgrade the accommodations to a better room @ nominal cost. And I requested (and received) a late check out which also proved helpful. As an Hhonors Gold member I received the standard amenities which come with being a Loyalty member and yes, everything you've read about the complimentary cookies are accurate. I made it a point to ask for no less than 2 cookies each day of my stay (yeah, they're that good).All the staff from check-in to check-out were excellent - friendly, professional and always accommodating. We ate @ Trees Lounge everyday either for breakfast or dinner depending on how our schedule was running with no complaints. Breakfast is complimentary or you can upgrade for a nominal cost and we also took advantage of Happy Hour most days cutting down on eating costs elsewhere.The location is also ideal (and another reason I chose this property) as it's close to everything without the expense of some of the larger chains and it's offerings are on par with what other area hotels in the category offer. Although the hotel was busy and filled with guests it somehow didn't feel overly crowded.Housekeeping service was also very good and the few times we encountered staff in the hallways they were friendly and always left our room well stocked with water and juice. Valet also stored our luggage for us upon checkout since we had an evening departure that day.We really didn't spend a great deal of time in the hotel given that we were out and about everyday of our stay but upon return we had the reassurance that everything would be fine from the long days exploring & touring.I look forward to returning to Doubletree Alana for my next visit.

We lived here in 2011-2015 so we knew how busy it was going to be for transfer season/tourist season. We requested a queen size basic room. We got there and they gave us a $270 (I think) suite. Credit card kept declining and we found out why....they didn't give us the TLA rate. So we got it squared away and were told we'd have to move rooms. Next 2 days, and we got a phone call, same thing. Found out they'd been lying to us that we requested that room. Even called us a list and said we inconvenienced them. Said we were moving rooms that day to a basic room with a full bed I think. The people there are NASTY and sooooo rude. Valet is insane. Regular parking is insane. Cont. Breakfasts are hard to find in Waikiki and we didn't want to pay $22/plate so it wasn't worth it at all. Crap kept happening almost every single day so it got to the point where I got online and talked to a person on their website chat thing. He directed me to the Director of Rooms. He called my husband, and he was HUMILIATED that my husband was treated with such disrespect and all the eye rolls. He said no military members deserve that because he knows PCSing is not fun. He was livid. Went into their system himself and made it to where the room was the price we were going to pay originally for the basic room. He also added a military discount for him. They were on the phone for maybe 30 minutes too. The elevators are hot and cannot accommodate a lot of people. People were getting mad at us each day that our stroller was too big and they had to catch the next one. It was awful. Housekeeping was disgusting. My son pooped through his diaper one day, and I wrote a note to housekeeping. We came back to the room, and it was the same comforter folded up with poop stains. The bathroom had hair in it the day we moved in. Sand all over the floor. Worst cleaning I've ever seen, so I complained about the experience on Facebook. The Director of Rooms saw my post, and called my room asking personally to talk to me. He asked me to send him pictures of our whole stay. Thank God I had 10-20 pictures for him. He said he'd give us $75 in credit to use at the restaurant and asked for a training course to be done with the housekeeping managed in my room. We came back and they missed some stuff. It was horrible. Then, my dad sent my one year old son and myself a card for each of us. Was supposed to be there by last Thursday or Friday. We checked out and moved into housing later Friday.

They did not honor the priority check-in benefit although I waited it in the priority check in side.

At the end I ask for one, and they told me they were very full for the next 5 days so he finally looked and offered me to change my standard room for another standard with a partial ocean view. He said that was the best he could do. I accepted. It's not much of an upgrade but it's something, but my question is? Should he tried to do this from the beginning without me asking?If you are planning on getting a rental car during your stay I would not recommend the hotel as you will be charged $40 a day (after taxes) for valet parking and there are better options out there with no parking fees.

The definition of resort: “a place designed to provide recreation, entertainment, and accommodation especially to vacationers.” The Doubletree is a hotel, not a resort since they don’t offer recreation, entertainment and only accommodation! This hotel barely offers a pool, has a workout space not any bigger than my room, one very casual/basic food space, and literally nothing else. Therefore, charging a “resort fee” is completely ludicrous and nothing short of screwing over their guests for an extra buck...well, $21 to be exact. There is NOTHING that I get from the resort fee that I don’t get by being a very loyal Hilton guest. There was a time I liked this hotel and have stayed here numerous times, but have no intention of ever returning while they are charging this fee.

Was told there was no diamond upgrade available because they were already gone. Was disappointed in the view from the back of the hotel – – the street’s kind of ugly. Tried for two days to move to another room. The location is not great if you want to experience downtown Waikiki. If you’d like to be out of the way, but still in a noisy spot, this is the place for you. It wasn’t until our third day when I spoke to a friend who had been upgraded at the Waikiki Hilton to a beach view, that I mentioned it to the front desk. They then were able to move us to the beach side of the hotel, although the room was much smaller. On Thursday, April 18 we were greeted by a different server for breakfast who was very rude. She scolded my wife when I let her taste my undercooked omelette. “Please don’t eat off of other peoples plates without paying for the upgrade,“ she said loudly in front of everybody to my family and I. I then mentioned to her that the coffee pot, cereal milk, And half-and-half We’re empty. She misunderstood and brought me a glass of milk. She was chatting with the other employees the whole time. Since I knew our regular server would not be returning till Saturday we ate breakfast elsewhere on Friday. (Go to eggs ‘n things – – it’s delicious!) Saturday things are back to normal.  Also on Thursday, our room was not cleaned, which we discovered when we return to the hotel at 4 PM. I mentioned it to housekeeping who was still in the hallway, but was then required to negotiate with them to find somebody to clean the room, and was told by the person that showed up there if we didn’t leave the room immediately she would not be able to clean it. I’m pretty sure this is it not how it works at a Hilton.It’s not a bad hotel, but I do expect more of the Hilton experience, especially when the woman I spoke with in March on the phone assured me that of the three Hilton properties, we were most likely to get an upgrade at the Doubletree. Not true. If I stay at a Hilton next time, it will be one of the other properties. The DVD machine in the lobby is very cool, though. And Henry and Elsa were a blessing at the front desk — they actually appeared available and were very helpful. The others not so much.",,Safari05052274734,0,2.0

There was an awkward position of the toilet paper holder that with the roll on it, it would bump my knee, the sink although modern an nice, offers very littler counter space. There are tons of storage in the room and has a large chair that turns in to a bed ideal for 1 kid. There is a mandatory resort fee of like $22, that has nothing for you other than a play station in the room, this is a business hotel with the same amenities they offer elsewhere, yet they charge a resort fee for nothing, and on top of that, if you rented a car be prepared to disburse $38+Tax/day for valet parking (in-n-out privileges), no self parking is offered. The pool is on the smaller side, but has plenty space and chairs for taking on the sun.

The valet was MIA for about 15min, so I parked at valet stand and checked in. The front desk agent was nice but seemed bothered I was just showing up, even asking if I had contacted the hotel about the late check in. I told the front desk I wanted the free bfst(gold-HH). I go get bfst the next AM or to be told I didn't choose that benefit. I even insisted I told the front desk the night before and they still didn't believe me. I walked to the front desk and told them I am ready to check out and I told them about the issue with bfst, and they double checked and there it was, I picked bfst. They apologized and offered zero compensation for a missed bfst. It gets better, 8-working days later they finally charged my amex-plat. I called the desk and talked to the MGR and they say one thing and Amex-Plat says something different. After all the issues I had with this DTree I would say it's a systemic issue of just go through the motions attitude. The room was Ok, AC works and the room was clean.

The front desk was efficient, if not overly effusive. No help with bags, but valet staff was excellent. The demi-suite was a little wonky: if you can imagine a large room with a nice balcony and a beautiful view, but this large room is laid out in an odd shape. The bed is set back against the ""maka'i"" wall, with a sliding partition door to separate it from the living area, which could be closed if desired. The TV is all the way against the ""mauka"" wall, and on the other side of a sofa - so if you want to lie in bed and watch TV ... you really can't. Room dated - which we didn't mind. Room needed a very thorough cleaning - which we did mind. The large size, coupled with a refrigerator made the room fairly pleasant, however. Breakfast ... well, if you want the full buffet, there is an upcharge. This seems to be inconsistent around the Doubletree brand, but okay. However, the breakfast area is WOEFULLY understaffed, and we didn't see a server until it was time for her to bring the bill. Cost-cutting by employee is a HUGE pet peeve of mine. Conversely, the selection and flavor were quite good. So, while the product and presentation are average (at best), the location and views more than make up for much of that. I'm also inclined to give a pass on the (lack of) cleanliness, because here in the US, folks have been conditioned to believe that ""okay"" is acceptable. Anyone who has done any sort of international travel would be (and should be) embarrassed at the state of cleanliness in the US.","Ewa Beach, Hawaii","Boeing767</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ewa Beach, Hawaii</strong>",451,4.0

We like the location because it is a 5-10 minute walk into the hustle and bustle of Waikiki but allows you to walk away from it. It is also 10-15 minute walk to the Ala Moana Centre. The main problem with the hotel was the room. Everything was damp, the bedsheets, the pillowcases and after a couple of days staying there everything in the wardrobe (clothes etc). We spoke to other people staying there and they had the same problem. When we mentioned it at reception we were just told that it is an ongoing problem and it couldn't be helped. The air conditioning has to be left on 24 hours a day because if it is turned off within 10 minutes the temperature if the room rises to 85 plus degrees, this makes the room very cold at night. We were there for 14 nights and hated the damp smell whenever you went back to the room. Also dressing in the clothes from the wardrobe was uncomfortable on a daily basis. The other problem with the room was the cleaning staff. One day they would knock on our door at 8:30 wanted access to the room, then on another day you would return to your room at 16:00 and your room hadn't been serviced. No consistentcy The trees restaurant was also a disappointment.

Since our room wasn't ready the first time until about 2pm, I called from the HHV where we were staying and had received a late 2 pm check out due to our Diamond status?? and asked if by any chance our room was ready. It wasn't, of course, at 10 am, but the nice lady texted my just after noon that it was so we checked out of the HHV and walked over. We were again on the 16th floor, but we were given a regular room and not a suite this time. We had a better view as the room faced the HHV and the water, but after the previous stay, I felt cramped. The bathroom was especially small with a toilet put in too small of an area between the shower and the sink. There was no bathtub as we had the previous year in a much more spacious bathroom! Since it was a regular room, it had the standard items: king sized bed, dresser with TV, desk, and chair plus coffee/tea station and a safe. I don't remember if there was a microwave and/or fridge. The only unique item here was the chair, which included a pullout single bed. It was a busier time this stay so I am not upset about not receiving a suite, but I was looking forward to a soaking bath on my last night in Hawaii and missed out on that. Last year, we were upgraded to omelets for breakfast at check-in as I have carb issues and usually only eat a large omelet plus a little more. This time we received it, but it was a much bigger production as we had to tell this person and that person where as the prior year, we were added to the list so we just had to tell one person on arrival! Diamonds should be given the full breakfast anyway, IMO as at the Doubletree near the Las Vegas airport where Golds receive the buffet but Diamonds get the buffet plus the hot, made to order items! Just a suggestion for the management to reward the top Hilton members automatically! This is even more significant now for Diamonds because there is a new $18 resort fee so the Doubletree and the Hilton Garden with its new $25 resort fee have joined the gang! Again, as a Diamond, I should receive most of these, especially the Internet, complimentarily! This hotel is a great Hilton brand base on this end of Waikiki. It's an easy walk to the Ala Moana shopping area, several less touristy restaurants once you cross the canal, the Iliki for Cinnamon's, even the HHV, and more. I have given up on the HHV and will use the Doubletree for my stay on this end of Waikiki only unless, of course, there are future Hilton brands in the area to try out.

Booked a standard city view king bedded room. It wasn't a bad stay. The hotel is not in central Waikiki which for me is a good thing. Slightly less noise and don't need to hear the roar of the motorcycles and cars ripping up Kuhio or Kalakaua. Grant it, there is still noise but just less of it. It's pretty much across from the Hilton Hawaiian Village (about a 5 minute walk). Our room was pretty standard Hilton; super comfy bed; and workstation with plenty of electrical outlets. Good size big screen TV. The bathroom wasn't a bad size (not tiny like other Waikiki properties) and the shower has one of those ""rainshower"" shower heads so lots of water comes out! (Actually surprised that there was this type of showerhead for Hawaii since it's a ""conservation"" state so hopefully the hotel is conserving water/energy to make up for all that water coming out of the showerhead. Mind me I'm not complaining but I hope the showerhead is somehow eco-friendly. My only real complaint is that there was not free wifi in the room (you would think these days it's standard) but luckily I have unlimited data on my phone. I didn't hear anyone outside our room (even though it seemed like the hotel was filled with every high school soccer team from the mainland). So thumbs up on the soundproofing of the room. The pool is in the mezzanine level and not a bad size (not huge either). The lobby is also not on ground floor (a good thing to keep the riff raff out) and I like that there seems to be unlimited coffee all day. Also some apples in the morning. I wasn't there when the afternoon cookies come out but I hear there were pretty delicious. The Fred Pryor workshop was actually in another building (there was a walkway) and it seemed to only have meetings rooms. The space was decent but the a/c was hard to control (hot, cold , hot cold, etc) The presenter himself was getting annoyed but we survived. Meeting rooms have bathrooms close by too so thumbs up.Overall it was a nice stay; much prefer the location of this hotel than other centrally ,located Waikiki hotels of the same standard. Most staff that I encountered seemed friendly and nice.","Honolulu, Hawaii","extravelagent</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",152,4.0

It’s NYC on a beach. And the resorts here do a good job trying to give you the island experience but some feel just as busy inside as they do outside. NOT the case here at the Doubletree Waikiki. The staff is amazing and so personable. From Valet to the Front desk to Housekeeping, they all go out of their way to do anything extra for you they can. They share tips, ask about your plans and interject ideas for how they can make it easier on you. Case in point, when we checked into this location from a prior stay at the megatropolis Hilton Waikiki across the street, Rebecca rushed our room setup so we could get in there faster and even moved us to a suite so we would have more room with the kiddos. And when she heard we were headed out early one day, she suggested we let them set up a to-go breakfast. This was done the following night and Leslie at the front desk even texted me to confirm. Housekeeping was AMAZING. Not only did they have us in our room quickly, but they left us extras like water and juice and slippers, as well. This hotel doesn’t have the oceanfront views as other Hilton across the street. But what it may lack in direct ocean view, it more than makes up for in service and accommodations. I never felt run over with people here and all of my Honors benefits were bestowed to me, unlike the larger property across the street - likely due to their size and undeniable ocean views. When given the choice, I would stay here every time, though. When I travel, I want to be comfortable and feel like my life is less busy than it is at home. This Doubletree fits the bill for me. I highly recommend giving them your business.","Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida","Mindy B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida</strong>",9,5.0

It is about 1 block away from the Hilton Hawaii Village. Walking to the other places takes about 20-30 mins depending on where you want to go. Check InArrived just before the rush hour, so after about 10 mins wait, I was helped. Front desk staff was in general friendly. Check-in was fast and I was off to my room after 5 mins. During check-in I was informed about the ridiculous resort fees (~18$) which I have zero idea why, just because it has Waikiki in the name? Worst of all it does not even cover the ridiculous compulsory valet parking of $36+. Therefore in total above the already expensive room, you have to pay $54+ additional fees. [If anyone knows about alternatives for parking in the area, it would be nice to know]. Resort fees is said to cover internet, complimentary water and coffee and fruits located next to the lobby area. In my opinion, this is daylight robbery. RoomI guess due to the high occupancy, I was luckily upgraded to a junior suite with views towards Waikiki beach. The room was spacious and had a small balcony. The sitting area in the room was nice and spacious. There was a small bar/kitchenette area. There was however only 1 TV in the room, so if close the partition door between the room and living room, you are not able to watch tv from bed.Bed was comfortable and the room climate control was good and luckily a central AC unit, so minimal noise.Bathroom was very spacious and for once, the shower head was more of European style rather than the US standard of a fixed shower head. Amenities were as other Doubletrees. DiningThey do have a not too shabby Pupus hour with some not too bad offereings and price (for hotel standard).Breakfast offering was buffett style with an egg station. The offerings are mainly typical DT's offerings with 2-3 Asian items. In general it was ok from quality point of view, however if I had to pay for the breakfast (~$25+ pp) I would say it was not worth the value (but again this is Waikiki) and I just spend it on other options at a better place for breakfast.ServiceIn general service was good with some staff being more friendly. One of the front desk staff that was really an assett to the hotel is Leslie (I hope I remembered her name correctly). She was genuinely friendly and welcoming to the different guests and always trying her best to solve issues. Hopefully she can be an example to the rest of the associates especially those interacting directly with guests.OverallAn OK hotel in general mainly for first time visitors to the area or need to be in the area. As indicated earlier, the only big downside of the hotel are the crazy (and improper) Resort fees and compulsory Valet parking. Too bad for guests that wants to stay loyal to the Hilton brand there are limited options available when in Oahu - it would be nice to have properties outside of the Honolulu/Waikiki area.","Eindhoven, The Netherlands","nldogbert</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Eindhoven, The Netherlands</strong>",331,3.0

I appreciate that. Throughout the whole stay they sent daily texts checking on us and if there was ever anything we needed, we simply replied to the last text and they took care of it. Talk about easy!!The rooms were very clean and spacious enough. I enjoyed the updates to the bathrooms with the nice showers but i did think the beds were a little hard. The room stayed hot as the thermostat only went down to 68 but I called the front desk and they came and reset it to go down to 62 degrees. The room had a fridge and they brought a microwave up to us upon our request. Digital key was very convenient as well. Because I am Hilton Honors Gold, I enjoyed free breakfast daily in the Trees restaurant. Honestly, breakfast was very good and we ate there most mornings because of that! Cookies were always available and if you caught the lady with the cookie cart she always handed you gobbs of cookies. We always got a kick out of that. LOL One day we walked up to our room with 4 packs of cookies! We used valet for a couple days and they were pretty easy to work with. They got our car to us pretty quickly and they were friendly enough even giving us walking directions when asked. I also had no issue with being charged the parking fee on the days I had no car to park. The resort fee charged covers beach towels, dvd rental and wifi. There is also a nice business center to use if needed. The hotel is convenient to the pink line shuttle stop and although it is on the out skirts of Waikiki, you can easily walk to shops, restaurants, beach etc...My one complaint about this hotel is that there is no self laundry. There is a laundromat around the corner behind the seven eleven but who wants to pack all of their clothes up in a suitcase and roll them around the block then sit in a laundromat? Having the comfort of just heading downstairs and having a lazy moment in the room would be more desirable.

The village will not upgrade but they let you pay the extra charge on the app if you want to be upgraded. DoubleTree gives free Buffett breakfast for gold & higher members, The villiage only give a $10 room credit which is insane as its barley enough to buy a Mai Tau at happy hour. The villiage Buffett breakfast is $40 or if you want a basic omelet is $25! Double Tree rooms are new, clean and upgraded; the Village rooms are outdated and dirty. Parking at DoubleTree is Valley and cheaper; Villiage self park far from the room is $42. DoubleTree is just across the street from the Villiage. Hands down I would recommended the Double Tree its just 1 block from the beach but if your really stuck on being connected to the beach and are OK for paying ALLOT more (room, parking, food, resort charge, etc..) for outdated room with zero benfits as Diamond member then stay at the Villiage. If you want a clean place that upgrades members and includes breakfast buffet for much less and 1 block from the beach then stay at DoubleTree.

Staff, in general, was not friendly and Miss Colleen working in their Tree's restaurant specifically ruined our breakfast and should be trained properly with what does breakfast menu entails. The hotel charges resort fee by adding services like Movies and Games rentals, beach towels etc. which is highly undesirable and gives excuses that everyone charges these fees and then there are additional charges for Parking. Considering the fee, options & the quality offered, none of these services are worth it.

The room smelled of must due to the air conditioning. I am a nurse practitioner with asthma and had to use my inhaler several times due to the smell of both the air conditioning and the strong cleaning supplies used to mask the odor. The hidden charges were absurd!! There are daily fees including an $18 ""resort fee"", $35 parking fees, $25 continental breakfast charges (per person). It was not what we were expecting when we booked the hotel for our vacation. We had a view that faced another high rise (the partial view of the ocean can only be seen by the balcony) and was charged $756.18 for two nights. The staff were friendly but not helpful.

We liked the Doubletree brand and didn't want to stay in the heart of Waikiki, and this place was within our budget, so we ended up here.The hotel is a little funky. It's on Ala Moana Boulevard near where it ends. When you walk or drive up and go inside, you aren't in the lobby. Instead you have to go up one level to get to the lobby. It's fairly small and the escalator takes up a lot of room. There's a few tables and chairs, a travel agent, and the front desk; a DVD rental machine, a bar/restaurant and a very small convenience store are off to the side. We checked in; Michael was a pleasure to work with, and we always enjoyed the free cookies we got. When we went up to our room, the first thing I immediately noticed was that it was extremely humid. This was a problem throughout our stay. Eventually someone came to ""fix"" it, but his fixing it consisted of him making the room cold - low 60s cold. The room was a little on the small side, but it was reasonably nice. I liked that the room had a PS3 that we could watch rented movies on. What I didn't like was the bathroom. Whoever designed the bathrooms at the Doubletree needs to be fired. The door to the bathroom is made of plexiglass or something similar; there's also a window in the wall between the bathroom and the rest of the room. You can't see through it, but light can easily pass through. As a result, anything you do in the bathroom can be clearly heard in the main room. Also, if you use the bathroom in the middle of the night and you turn on the light in there, it will flood the main room with light. We had to get a nightlight to deal with this issue. Other than that, the bathroom was big enough that there was room for a tub. However, there was only a shower. It really is too bad; I'd expect a room like this to have a tub, plus with all the extra room in the bathroom, it makes the main part of your room smaller.So our room was good, even if it was a little small and either humid or cold, plus the bathroom situation. The hotel was nice, but there were some problems. The hotel has 3 elevators. Despite the fact they are all together, you have to push 2 buttons to call them. Also, one was not working the entire time we were there. The gym was decent but a bit small. The pool looked nice but I never went in. The restaurant off the lobby offers breakfast, but you have to pay unless you are a gold or diamond level member of Hilton Honors, which we became while staying here. Unfortunately nobody bothered to tell us, so I didn't find out about it until I heard the front desk tell someone else a day or two before we checked out. Breakfast was pretty good, especially if it was free. There's another restaurant on the lower level by where you walk in called the Hiking Hawaii Cafe. Although not open for dinner, we found it a great place to have lunch.The Doubletree is a good hotel. We thought it was a solid option, though there were some things that were screwy about it. Above all else though, I felt that they tried harder. Our room cost about $245/night; about $47 of this is taxes and fees. This is about $40 less/night than the Hilton Hawaiian Village a little over a block away, but right on the beach. I guess what I'm trying to say is the Doubletree is a good hotel with access to all Waikiki has to offer. It's still not cheap though but it's better than the cheap hotels in the area. I thought the resort fee was ridiculous for what you get. It also seems that this hotel gets a lot of business travelers; I saw flight crews from multiple airlines while staying here. So here it is: it's not on the beach, it's a little small, and the bathroom sucks. But it's still nice enough (in some ways nicer than a room at the Hilton) and it's less than the Hilton. Is it worth it or is it better to pay the extra amount to stay at the Hilton? That's for you to decide, but if you have the room in your budget and you're here for vacation, I suggest you splurge on the Hilton.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Mark A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",75,3.0

The Bell/Door persons were extremely friendly and helpful. The Banquet guy, Tony, was also very helpful and went out of his way to help with changing the room set up, adding more chairs, and even grabbed menus for me. I used the Hilton app to check in, when I arrived the room I reserved was not available. When checking in, I did not realize that I had received a text while I was enroute about the room change, so I asked why??? I was told in so many words that I did not qualify for the room. The front desk agent did check with the MOD or supervisor, who did not come out of the office, which was behind the open door she stuck her head in. I'm sure he could hear the conversation, but he left it to her to explain the reasoning, which did not sound great. I found out from the manager, Clinton the next day, that I had selected an accessible room which they needed for a guest who required an accessible bathroom. A much better explanation... wish I was told that the night before. They should probably not allow guests to select those rooms using the app to check in. I was also told that I did not pay for breakfast and that I was paying a discounted rate for the resort fee.

Gee, thanks. While the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was tiny and the room had very poor lighting. I figured it would be okay for just two nights, but when I laid down in bed I saw that there was a trail of ANTS crawling across the nightstand. This is on the 14th floor! I called the front desk and the clerk offered to spray insecticide on the nightstand. I declined (who wants bug spray right next to their head all night) and he sent a maintenance guy up to investigate. After showing him the ant trail, they agreed to move my room about 3 doors down. Very similar room, but much better location and no ants (I would have appreciated having this room in the first place - rather than being nestled among the elevators and ice machine). The staff were courteous, but the property was just so so. There’s a small restaurant in the lobby that has an overpriced breakfast buffet and a bar.

The lighting was good, and I did not have to use the 100 watt light bulb I usually bring with me. The bathroom was modern, but no tub, just a shower. Those of you with little children should ask if there is a room with a tub. The hot water was quick to kick in, and there was plenty of it. The coffee pot in the room was a Kuerig coffee maker, with tea as well as coffee included.In the common areas, there were a couple of nice lounge areas. They did have a breakfast area, but I was not sure if it was an included breakfast or not, as they did not advertise dinner. I do not think there was a bar there, but there might have been.These are questions you need to ask while making reservations.It did have a fitness room as well as pool. I did not use either of these facilities as I was basically exploring the city. It is located approximately 20 minutes or less to the beach, depending on how fast you walk and how much ""junk"" you carry with you.One thing you NEED to know, to save money is DO NOT RENT A CAR. You do not need it. Most things are within walking distance, and the public transportation is GREAT. I was traveling alone, had a few days layover after being on a remote island 2500 miles away, so decided to stop and take a tour of Pearl Harbor, and other must-do sights, as well as a scuba dive trip. I was there December 23rd-27th, so had a solo Christmas dinner at a small Sicilian restarurant which again, was within walking distance. The island had a large mall , with a central area that was gorgeously decorated for Christmas.","Indian Harbour Beach, Florida","alyssacuomo1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Indian Harbour Beach, Florida</strong>",16,4.0

Probably just best to stay their (Hilton Hawaiian Village) except that it's typical Waikiki - 1000s of rooms, and made to feel like a cruise ship. Very nice beach, though, and that's the main (only) attraction to Waikiki itself. Otherwise it's all one big shopping mall and skyscraper condos/hotels.The Doubletree rooms are standard hotel rooms. I had a problem with a previous occupant's garbage on the lanai, which took 2 days for the hotel to address.There is an $18 resort fee which includes nothing. The pool is extremely modest, and there's an adequate fitness center.

Location - walking distance to sister hotel, Hilton Village with great pools and beach lagoon, Ala Moana shopping one direction and the all that Waikiki has to offer the other directions, nearby restaurants, convenience stores and car rentals at Discovery Centre and access to nearby bus routes. Room Configuration - there were 3 of us, all females so the room design with 2 very comfortable queen sized beds, a small kitchenette with microwave and fridge, a bathroom with wide mirror and bench top and a small change room also fitted with a mirror and PowerPoint worked well. The seperate small lounge area with a second tv was also very appreciated as were the balconies with additional seating with one looking directly over to the Fort Derussy Park. Price point - we got all this space for slightly cheaper than the resorts on the beach offering much smaller rooms. The wifi was complimentary as I was a Hilton member. Conveniences/amenities coffee, water and fresh cookies on offer 24/7 in the lobby station. Two choices of food places.valet parking was available at $35 a night. Swimming rooftop pool. So it ticked all the boxes for us and we were not disappointed. The decor in the room was a little tired and dated but very clean. The aircon was set to a low of 20c which was on occasion not cool enough but when there was a breeze the two balconies afforded us a cross breeze however there were no screens on the doors and although on the 16th floor street noise could still be heard and was at times quite loud. Also if you are in a rush current work upgrading on the elevators means that you may be held up for a considerable time and the stairs become a viable quicker option. Staff were very pleasant. There was an Expedia tour and activity desk in the reception area and we were able to book our whole week of tours and activities with the very knowledgeable and friendly Josh.

It is at the quieter end of Waikiki which was a plus for me, though if you want to be in the thick of it try somewhere else. The hotel is quite old from the outside however is well presented and quite new inside. The elevators are not very good, as they are not all connected to one button and are quite slow, this is not helped by the fact that most of the time one of the elevators seemed to be out of service. They had a sign up referring to renovations that they were doing on the inside of elevators, but that does not excuse the fact that you have to push two buttons and then wait quite a bit of time (often in the minutes) for the elevator to show. The room was quite good, and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was small and the WiFi worked well. The power went out due to a storm on my first night and I was unable to get cable channels for the remainder of my trip there. Breakfast in the restaurant downstairs was pleasant though very meat heavy. There also appeared to be no lactose free/soy milk option for milk. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly and helped me organise a shopping trip the the outlet centre. The escalator that you have to take from the lower lobby was quite narrow and the floors inside the lobby and lower lobby were slippery when it was wet outside. I tried to use the pool the first day of my trip and was told that it was under renovation and that I would need to walk to another Hilton property, I declined and did not try again to use the pool area. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for people needing to be in Waikiki but needing some quiet time. It is within reasonable walking distance to most things and there are some nice restaurants around. If you want to be somewhere closer to the action or the beach I would recommend that you try another Hilton property; of which there are several in the area. Pricing was about average for a Hilton hotel and as with most hotels in Waikiki nothing is cheap. Having said that I think it is a touch overpriced given the location and the age of the property.","Sydney, Australia","83poolie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",79,4.0

The room was clean and appeared recently remodeled with updated furnishings. However the update did not consider requirements for plenty of electrical outlets for today's electronic filled life. I take a star off for the bathroom, which was clean and updated but.... the toilet was so close to the wall one has to almost sit sideways. And, no, we are not huge people. The toilet paper holder was an updated design that made the roll fall off at least half dozen times per seating. Very frustrating to have to constantly chase after the roll under the circumstances. The shower was probably a 10"" step up - awkward for me but I can imagine a greater challenge for the elderly. The worst part of the bathroom experience was the 1.5"" cockroach that stared me down as I sat there. Near panic ensued during the heat of battle as a wounded cockroach charged me at full speed as I sat. Awful. The good news is it only happened once. There is a small, simple exercise room with dumbbells and a few machines. There is a token pool, large enough for kids to splash around in. Parking was $35/day with in and out privilege. Valet was usually fast and attentive though there were some exceptions. Room had small refrigerator and coffee maker. Maid service was ok, but didn't seem to have their mind in their work when refilling used coffee and tea and replacing towels.

The hotel is situated on the western edge of the Waikiki area, down the street from Hilton Hawaiian Resort complex. I have always stayed here on business and it is a favorite for many of my colleagues.First, I would like to say that every time I have stayed at the hotel, the staff has been top notch. They are always friendly and willing to assist. Nice job. The hotel itself is old and probably could use some updating in areas. The rooms are a good size and the layout is good. Your views are not the greatest, but the higher up you go, the better things are if you are on the south side. I have had the privilege to stay in on of the suites and it is very spacious. Also, the air-conditioning seemed to have a hard time keeping my room at the set temp, so, you may want to set it a bit lower than you really want to get that desired temperature.Second, it being in Waikiki, it is a very busy area. Thus, hearing sirens multiple times of the day is the norm. If you are a light sleeper then, you may want to reconsider another location. Third selecting your rooms. If you are a Hilton Honors member, they do have dedicated Hilton Honors areas on the upper floors. Having stayed on higher floors, I have a tendency now to stay in the mid-range area because I found the higher up you go, the more stops you make on the way up and down. As I mentioned, getting a room on the south side, gives you partial oceanview. The north side of the building, allows you to see the apartment building next door along with a city view. Conveniences. WiFi is free for Hilton Honors members, I believe silver and above. This is where I think DT could use some improvement. The servers don't seem very strong and are spotty depending on the time of day. Whatever you do, don't expect to get WiFi on the balcony. I was never able to get it. The gym is pretty decent. Breakfast is pricey, but, this is Hawaii, so I guess that's to be expected. The spread could be a little bigger. They are currently going through a renovation of the normal breakfast/bar area, so perhaps we will see a change. The pool...eh, nothing really big here. I always look for a hot tub, but, not here.Local area. Cheeseburger Waikiki is right next door if you want a quick bite without going too far. One of my favorite places to go is the Grand Harue around the corner. It serves Thai food and is never crowded, and the food is really good. This has been a bit lengthy, so I apologize for the dissertation. The bottom line is you're not in the heart of all activity, but everything is still within walking distance. You will enjoy the stay here. It's not the Ritz, but, it is still a nice hotel and the staff makes it well worth it. I would also say that the cookies are phenomenal, so if you stay, make sure you get one every day.","Pensacola, FL","flip24</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pensacola, FL</strong>",2,4.0

We are a family of 4 with 2 teenage children...I miss it already. The hotel, staff, and service was awesome!! The rooms were clean and very comfortable. The location was totally perfect-its not a luxury resort, but we were looking for a place to stay to get out and see the island, not to stay in the room or the hotel. The location is close enough to walk to Waikiki, but far enough out where you don't have to battle the traffic from the big hotels (a definite plus during the 4th of July week!!) For the price, it could not be beat-very affordable!STAFF: The service was WONDERFUL! The staff was very accommodating and gracious. At one point I couldn't figure out how to manage the wifi on my phone, and they offered to send up a Technician to help me with my screwup...I thought that was really great! They offered dining options that are close by-their restaurant was being revamped during our stay... (the Hiking Cafe right outside the front doors was wonderful, as was the Aloha Kitchen, located right behind the hotel). Warm cookies, fruity water & apples were always waiting for us upon return from our travels. They also have a concierge that is ready & willing to help you with making plans for your trip (at a discount, I might add). The valets were so wonderful, speedy & helpful. Eric was especially kind-greeted us by name & had our car within a minute each time we needed it.ROOMS: Room was very clean and comfortable. We had a small lanai with a partial ocean view. Our room was cleaned promptly every day & had plenty of storage, as well as a microwave and a mini refrigerator. It was perfect for us as we typically left pretty early in the morning and returned later in the evening.LOCATION: Our daughter attends UH, so we have stayed in several places in Waikiki. The Double Tree location was great b/c you are walking distance to Waikiki, but you can get out of it fairly easily as well....the traffic on heavy weekends can be crazy getting out from the ""strip"" of resorts-we appreciated being slightly outside of that mess. You can easily walk to the lagoon, Waikiki, the Beachwalk, or any other options that you would like to get to. We walked to Duke's in about 20 minutes, the Hilton Hawaiian Village is diagonally across the street. It was perfect for us!!Overall, we had an exceptional experience at the Double Tree.

Staff were happy to look after our bags for us and said the room wasn't ready yet. Sometimes we've been lucky and the room has been available, but this time we had to wait and were told to come back at 3pm. My partner came back at 2 to see if it was ready and no still not ready, so he was happy to wait in the lobby. The male receptionist said he would come and get him when it was ready and due to his disability, they'd have a room more suitable. Front desk was busy checking a lot of people in, so no one came to get him, so at 3pm he went back and hey presto the room was just ready. The female receptionist gave us free internet for our time there (12 days) to make up for the fact that we weren't getting a more suitable room. Oh well the free internet made up for it.During our stay at 8.30am we were often asked by the cleaner if they could clean our room, so it pays to put the sign on the door to come back later. Although we did this once and they never came back. When we returned at 4pm and rang to ask why the room hadn't been cleaned, they said it was because we had the sign on our door, but it had been removed at 10.30 when we went out. We asked if they could clean it while we went out for dinner so it wasn't a problem, but there should be better ways of checking off the rooms as to whether they have been serviced or not.  There was a high step into the shower, and although there was a hand rail, it was not that easy for my partner to get in and out. And once wet, the tiled floors were quite slippery especially for him who has trouble walking. Shower pressure is very rain shower like, quite low pressure, and sometimes the temperature fluctuated. There was a lack of amenities that are common in most hotels, I had to ask for a shower cap, and had to go to reception to pick it up. Lighting also wasn't the best, there is no main light in the room. So the double tree brand seems like it is HIlton's budget brand. The fridge in the room was small but empty, so a quick trip round the corner to the ABC shop for cold drinks, water, beer, wine to fill it up was really handy. It was nice also to sit out on the lanai/balcony, not much privacy and not the greatest of views, but nice to relax with a beer/wine.Bed and pillows were nice and comfy and we had no other issues with housekeeping, they did a great job, other than that small hiccup on one of the days, but it was put right very quickly. Location was good, turn right and a short walk up the road, past the traffic lights were bus stop and trolley stop. Or turn left and go to the Waikiki Cheese burger then head up the street for about 12 minutes and you're in Waikiki central. So a very handy location indeed. Lifts were sometimes quite a while to wait, so make sure you get on and off at LL. Would I stay here again, possibly but maybe I'd try somewhere closer to the beach, but then again, it was nice that the hotel wasn't so busy. It's a $5 bus ride for 2 to Ala Moana shopping centre, and a $10 - 12 return trip in a taxi if you can't be bothered waiting for the bus/trolley, so location was as I say pretty handy and not expensive in a taxi.Out of 10 I'd rate it a 7 for this type of hotel, there's better out there, but then again it's pretty good for what it has to offer and for Hawaiian prices not too bad, and no rip off resort fee was welcome.","Wellington, New Zealand","Mahi A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",40,3.0

The shopping is fantastic, the pools looked so inviting, and there is access to the lagoon - a lovely place for families to picnic and swim without threat of ocean waves and the crowd of surfers and their boards. The beach is there, and it goes on forever, where a paved walkway offers easy walking and biking. On the north end of Waikiki, where the action is at a slower pace, It is ideal for families. The Alana Doubletree is shadowed by this larger resort Hilton, but still, it has its appeal.

The elevators groan and creak, the carpeting is becoming thread bare, the paint on the wall corners had been rubbed through, the sofa cushions are tired after so many years of hosting guests.

The windows aren't very effective at blocking the sound, the doors to the hallway are as thin as the partiers were loud.

The lady at the front desk was so very welcoming and friendly. I explained my dietary issues and she made sure our complimentary breakfast that we receive for our Diamond status was sufficient. This was a great touch. Our 16th floor room wasn’t ready yet so we checked our luggage downstairs with the valet and took another mile hike to a great little local, Chinese restaurant called the Maple Garden, which had a great lunch buffet where we were the only non-locals but welcomed and invited back on our next visit. We had not received a phone call to let us know our room was ready so we walked over to the Hilton Hawaiian Village and hung out with the ducks for a while and then returned to the Doubletree. Our room was still not ready at 2 pm, but a different, but still very welcoming and friendly lady, said she would take care of us and 15 minutes later, the room was ready. One bright spot about 2 arrivals was that we received 4 of the delicious cookies-2 from each lady. Our room was a suite. It was nice to have a large room after the Hilton Garden Inn’s small European-like compact space. The king sized bed was just the right firmness and had good pillows. The bathroom had a tub with hand held device also, which is always a great thing to have. Bathroom had sink and toilet and plenty of room so not cramped. The suite provided a large area with sink, microwave, fridge, and safe. Large closet for hanging clothes, as well as drawers in TV stand for less formal clothing, storage, etc. Large screen tv with many channels. Great extended balcony with view towards inland so could see golf course directly ahead with park off to right and mountains in distance. Could see fireworks’ reflection in condo next door but not directly from our room. Room next to elevator bank but never heard elevator. It could be noisy at times with sirens (mostly ambulances) below, but we had no trouble when we were trying to sleep. Bed on far side of room from elevator so no issue with noise while sleeping. Ice machine 10-15 feet away on other side of elevator doors.Breakfast was great (much better in most ways than that at HGI). Omelets and eggs were made to order along with other choices like scrambled eggs, meats, waffles, and more, if desired. I had egg white omelets each day. They made sure we were taken care of as Diamond members. One thing missing was peanut butter for toast. They had several types of breads, fresh fruit, and several choices for juice (the pineapple was from the Dole can so added sugar?). Service was efficient and done as teamwork. The coffee was strong Hawaiian type and was better here than that at the HGI. In conclusion, since we stayed at two Hilton brand properties on this Hawaiian vacation, I am comparing the two as I write my reviews. Overall, the Doubletree won out between the two. We felt cramped at the HGI plus the staff wasn’t as welcoming and friendly but more robotic. The room comparison was a definite winner for the Doubletree. Location has its pluses and minuses for each, but we like to stay part time on each end of Waikiki so that worked out as last time when we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Holiday Inn, both of which have resort fees unlike each of these where we stayed this time although I have read that the Holiday Inn now has them but waives them for status which I have! The Doubletree will probably be our first choice on our next visit for the Ala Moana end of Waikiki. It was convenient to the great restaurants at the Ilikai, close enough for an easy walk to the Ala Moana mall with Long’s Drugs (part of CVS chain) for the best priced souvenirs, and access to the Hilton Hawaiian Village to visit and enjoy without paying their high resort fees! So besides the missing peanut butter at breakfast, I have no complaint with the Doubletree. WE WILL RETURN!","Orlando, Florida","BerlinG-ParisF</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",897,5.0

The cost was about $40.00. The hotel is about 35 minutes from the airport in moderate traffic. Upon arrival to the hotel the bell desk is downstairs and they were waiting to assist. We were only in Waikiki for 3 days and we had booked the Paradise Cove Luau for that evening so we had to hurry up and get changed to go meet the bus to transport us there. The front desk lady was very nice and helpful. As we were honors members she asked if we wanted extra points or if we wanted continental breakfast. We selected the breakfast and had that each morning. It was well worth it! I asked where the Ileki hotel was as that was where we were to meet the bus for the luau and for the two other tours we booked. She said it was about an 8 minute walk from the hotel. We went to our room and changed from our flight clothes into more comfortable shorts and we were off. We started walking from the hotel and reached the corner where we saw the huge Hilton Waikiki Village hotel right on the water. Keep in mind that this Doubletree hotel is not on the water and you will have to walk to reach the water. Also know that even though it is not on the water they are a great hotel and there are way fewer people than at the other hotels on the water. This is a benefit as far as I am concerned. The rooms are also very nice at this hotel. The maid staff was fantastic and there wasn't anything to complain about. We walked to the Ileki hotel each day to the three flag poles where our tours departed from. You could also pick up the pink line which is the trolley at this location as well. It was convenient to most Waikiki activities/tours. Next to the hotel are two restaurants and we ate at the cheeseburger one, the burgers were good. The brewing company next door was very lively and we stopped for a beer one night. There are a lot of little 7-eleven touristy stores around that area for souvenir shopping as well.","Seminole, Florida","FltravelGirl08</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seminole, Florida</strong>",93,5.0

My sister booked this hotel for us, attending a conference and was too slow to book the Hilton Village which i was initially sad about. However, the Doubletree actually turned out to be a much better, clearly superior choice! We had a really smooth check in last night after awful 7 hour flight during which my niece barfed on me... staff were amazing esp the the lady at the front desk who was so nice and personable, also the bellman who brought our luggage. A Plus service all the way. I was super happy with my room! Everything is modern, updated, extremely clean and smells nice. Very efficient air conditioning. The toiletries provided smell lovely- from Crabtree and Evelyn. Very nice bedding and beds are amazing and comfy. There is a mini fridge to keep drinks cool and great location, 7-11 and ABC stores down the street. Wifi is reliable and speedy. If you sign up for HIlton Honors club, the wifi is free! The pool is quite large and very nice. Shaded in later day which is great. Pool area is immaculate and there are super nice chairs on the deck area to hang out and relax. The other really good thing is the resturant - we got a package that included breakfast, and this is the best deal ever! They have loads of hot food selections- eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, cereal and milk, yougart, fresh fruits, even an omlet station! The ham was amazing and so tender... honestly some of the best ham I have ever had at a hotel! Everyone who works at this hotel is great. Full of good suggestions on things to do and see. Housekeeping does a really good job. Super efficient and thorough.I enjoy the attention paid to being environmentally friendly at this hotel. Location is AMAZING. 15 min walk to Ala Moana Mall if you are into shopping.Also quick walk to the HIlton Village down the street. You can use the lagoon if you are staying at this Hilton, however not the pools. Which is fine, cause the pools I did see were absolutely chock-full of screaming children and was terrifying rather than relaxing. The area is very busy and safe. Most of the people staying at the Doubletree look like business travellers or international tourists. Pretty quiet, not a huge number of children. We do have young children in our group and everyone has been super nice. I honestly cannot think of any downsides to this hotel other than a bit of a walk to the beach (if you have very poor mobility then better to stay right on the beach), or if you care about a view - this one consists mostly of other concrete buildings.Overall this is an awesome hotel and I would come back here in a heartbeat!","Halifax, Canada","cake-and-pie-eater</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Halifax, Canada</strong>",238,5.0

It had a coffee maker, microwave and mini fridge.Because of its location, the DoubleTree never gives you a breathtaking view of the ocean. There are buildings around it and it's a few blocks from the beach. The best you can do is a partial ocean view or face mauka. The location isn't too bad...closer to a lot more local haunts than the higher dollar touristy ones.

It’s located about two blocks from Duke Kahanamoku Beach, which is behind the Hilton Hawaiian Village resort. The average Doubletree Waikiki hotel room is relatively small, especially compared to a room at the Hawaiian Village. They feature less attractive views of the surrounding area. The rooms were relatively recently updated, which can especially be seen in the bathrooms; my bath had a large-head shower elevated from the floor by a step, and a shelf for cosmetics and bathroom accessories opposite a sink and a toilet. The lighted vanity mirror provided too little illumination to be of much use. The bed was comfortable, up to mid-range Hilton standards, and the entire room was clean and showed little wear. The room also featured a settee, a desk, a bureau, a small refrigerator, and a safe.Wi-fi was slow and nearly useless. Hotel management needs to address that as a priority. The television had the usual cable channels, including an HBO offering. The channels also included Asian-language selections. One may also avail oneself of pay-per-view movies.The hotel has a convenient restaurant on the lobby level (which is on the second floor, per U.S. standards). There is the usual overpriced $18 buffet at breakfast. One block away is the Wailana Coffee House, which is open 24/7 and provides a Hawaiian take on an IHOP-level-of-quality and price. (If you insist on IHOP, there’s one right next to the Wailana Coffee House.) The rooms offer coffee machines that are clearly little used; much more convenient and better tasting would have been Keurig machines. You’ll have to walk a block-and-a-half to get to a Starbucks at the Hilton Hawaiian Village; three blocks away, northbound on Kalakaua, is a Hawaiian Coffee Experience Center. The hotel is adjacent to the Waikiki Brewing Company--a nice outdoors place to watch a sports game and drink a decent beer. You are a couple of blocks north from the start of shopping on Kalakaua.There’s no self-parking. For about $35 dollars a day you will have to use valet-only parking.Like many visitors to Hawaii, you may just want a place to sleep that isn’t far from the beaches and the shopping. This hotel, then, may work for you. But if you want to be steps from the beach and close to shopping--and don’t mind paying the additional resort fees--then choose one of the beach hotels.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","dc888traveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",44,3.0

Unfortunately I've had no choice but to reduce my rating because of a huge error thanks to Ken at the tours desk who, in essence ruined our holiday. Initially we booked all our tours through hoku and she was excellent, professional and through. Unfortunately on Xmas day, it was ken at the desk, and aside from giving really bad advice about driving around the island, he lost our booking for a 7 seater hire car! we had set aside the day to drive around the island and he put our booking on hold without finalising it!! I went to see him 2 times to be assured the booking was there, only to find on the day That we had nothing! it was a Tuesday so we couldn't go to Hanauma Bay and it was too late to book anything else. We managed to book a 5 seater on our last day, but it was too rushed as we had to combine it with Hanauma Bay and couldn't drive out as long. What was worse is that one of our kids had to stay back, splitting the family up. We have been so upset abt this...it ruined our trip..don't understand how he could be so disorganised and careless.

The hotel met these needs, being about a 10 minute walk back down to Waikiki beach along Kalakaua, and about the same to the shopping centre via Ala Moana Blvd. The Hilton Hawaiian village is just 5 minutes away.Upon arrival at 12.30pm we were delighted to find our room for 9 nights available, although I wasn't afforded my usual Hilton Honors gold benefits (as I had booked via Agoda), so ended up in the standard room on the 7th floor, which stunk of cigarette smoke, so we requested it to be changed and got another standard on the 8th level which was comfortable, spacious, and realively modern in its renovation.

I did not eat at the lobby restaurant, rather went out for my meals. About 2 blocks is the entrance to the Hilton Village, you can charge things to your room at a few places, like the restaurant, however cannot use the facilities (pool, etc.) the beach is gorgeous if you walk the 2 blocks away from the Alana. Just follow the tourist! Water super warm and clean. I bought a towel and book at the ABC store near the hotel and enjoyed the sun for a few hours. You can spot the business peeps a mile away. We all have hotel or Hawaii towels, are alone with a book and about to get sunburned! The Alana does have a small pool located on one of the floors above the lobby, with plenty of chairs to sit and enjoy the warm air, however the hamburger restaurant located nearby will cause you to smell burger cooking, clearly depending on the flow of the wind! And the pool is very small. The rooms have a small fridge and if you walk to the local grocery store about 3 blocks you can buy extra waters or snacks for later.

I travelled across the world to stay at this hotel and that was not a pleasant reception as one should expect from a Hilton hotel. It was past 11pm and I had no place else to stay, because if it was earlier I would go somewhere else.

I'm also an SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) member for several years, have accomulated lots of points and I never had this kind of experience. With them, I always feel a valued and cheriched costumer.

But, this Double Tree is in an excellent location for the business traveler or someone who doesn't have to be on the beach - it is very close to excellent restaurants, the convention center, Ala Moana Mall, etc and so it is much cheaper and less crowded. And, the beaches of Waikiki are a short walk away if you do want the crowds and sand; I prefer to go to the north shore for beaches and waves.It's not new and some furnishings show their age, but overall it is very well kept and the bed and linens were very comfortable. The fitness room is excellent; didn't try the pool but it is the usual small size - nothing fancy or with a good view. The bar is pretty small and plain (it is also the dining room), but good, relatively cheap drinks, and excellent staff, so 2 thumbs up. We had a dinner event in the hotel's large meeting room - excellent hors d'oeuvres, way too expensive drinks, and a rather minimally decorated room - the ambiance was non-existent.

The hotel is in a great location near several restaurants and shops. Here's a breakdown of my experience across the areas:Front Desk Staff and Management: Phenomenal! The staff and management were very professional and courteous throughout my 74 day stay. I had the opportunity to meet almost everyone on the day and night shifts. Elsa, Claire, Marya, Michelle, Jim, Wing as well as many others always greeted us with a smile and those awesome warm cookies! My daughter and I enjoyed the conversations we had after work and school. Everyone definitely made us feel welcome. The staff was also knowledgeable regarding the military and TLA. Valet: The valet staff was awesome! Always very helpful and responsive. Greeted my daughter with a warm hello everyday. They set the tone for the hotel. Can't remember all the names but I do thanks Pedro, Shane and the rest of the crew. Appreciated your assistance moving all the items I accumulated over my stay. Restaurant Staff: Staff was very nice. We enjoyed the breakfast. Great selection of foods. Also had room service several times and the food was timely and good.Check out: The staff was very nice during out checkout. Although we were happy to finally move into our home, we were also sad to leave the wonderful staff that made our initial months on the island pleasant. Housekeeping: The room and hotel were always clean. The housekeeping staff was always pleasant and responsive.Follow up: Claire was nice enough to send a note to check up on my daughter and I after we checked out. I thought that was very thoughtful. Resort Fee: NONE!!!!! No resort fee is charged which is a plus for military members on TLA. Parking: Valet parking is available. The cost is expensive for extended stay. Fortunately, the hotel is conveniently located near the Hale Koa so I purchased a monthly parking pass there. Wifi: As a Hilton Honors Member I had free WiFi.Business Center: Computers available for printing and faxing. Scanning was available at the front desk. Overall, I had a great experience and I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends.

We had come to chill, eat & shop and that's just what we did. I like to stick with the Hilton brand as you tend to know what you're getting and I feel safe with that. The hotel was in a great location for us, inbetween the shopping centre and main eateries of Waikiki. We didn't hire a car, it was convenient enough to walk either way. I wouldn't class this hotel as an ideal family stay as its not really geared up for young children (need to go to the Hilton Hawaiian Village for that) although it has a good pool. It was all that we needed, clean rooms, bedding, helpful & cheerful staff etc. Not much of an atmosphere but wasn't looking for that and enjoyed the fact there was no banging of doors etc in the early/late hours by children. Had a few drinks in the bar during happy hour before heading off out to dinner, but it was quite a sombre affair. We didn't have breakfast either, although it smelt great, we were on an Acai bowl quest, to test and rate as many as possible in the vicinity! The location is on a busy road, but this didn't affect our stay and we felt safe at night walking back, although make sure you know where you are going beforehand, as with all tourist places, they have their homeless etc. This hotel is good value in comparison to some other hotels in Waikiki and I would probably stay here again.

We arrived at the hotel and were greeted warmly by the front desk staff and checked in promptly. We took our luggage up to the room ourselves and we were given the same room I picked out when I checked in early via that Hilton app. Our room was also quite musty. It was also apparent that it wasn't like the other rooms I saw on the website. The bathroom was very small and cramped. There was little room to keep anything in the bathroom and a very small shelf in the shower for any toiletries. The beds were comfortable. We found the small fridge by accident, but it didn't keep anything cold even though it was turned to the highest setting. What was consistently inconsistent was the housekeeping service. One day the room was cleaned, the next day it wasn't. One day we asked a staff member in the hall that was cleaning another room if she would be able to clean our room that day, and she told us her card didn't work in our door so she wouldn't be able to clean it. We offered to open it for her, and again she stated her card didn't work. We again offered to open it for her and she asked if we wanted her to clean the room right then? We offered to wait in the room, and then she said, no, she could clean the room right away. We went downstairs and waited about 45 minutes until my husband went back upstairs to check her progress and she had just finished. The day after that, our room wasn't cleaned. I fully realize this is a very large hotel and by no means was I expecting housekeeping by a certain time, but I didn't understand the service only every other day. We never put out a door sign refusing service or ""do not disturb"" if we left for the day. I also want to note that I spoke to several other conference attendees that were staying at other large hotels, and they also had a musty odor in their rooms. I even noticed it in some restaurants while we were there. Many of the hotels, business, etc. don't have A/C throughout the whole building; Doubletree does not have A/C in the hallways. We did not patronize the restaurant; we went to other places close by as we found them less expensive. We also didn't check out the pool or fitness center. We didn't rent a car, but the bell/concierge desk staff were always very pleasant. and the baggage storage between check-out and our cab ride to the airport later that day was excellent. Overall, we had a nice stay at the Doubletree. At check-out, I did discuss the inconsistent housekeeping with the woman at the front desk. ",,Wlcgrad00,3,4.0

The trip was a combination of business and pleasure. Hilton Properties is the provider of choice for my employer. This was our third stay at this hotel. On arrival, we were told that the AC was down but that they expected it to be up and running in a day or two. Until the AC was back, we were provided a fan to help keep the room cool. Unfortunately, the AC never did get repaired and we used the fan the entire stay. No offer was made to relocate us to another hotel (the Hilton Hawaiian Village is a block away), though there was a big convention/meeting/symposium in town and perhaps there were no other rooms available. Still, the fact that every time I asked, the reply was that they expected to have the AC back up in a day or two. I finally stopped asking!As I indicated, this was our third stay at the Doubletree Alana-Waikiki. The stays were about 1 1/2 to 2 years apart. On the two previous stays, the facility appeared to be well-maintained - no major repairs needed, things kept nice and tidy, etc. This time, however, the facility had an overall 'tired' feel to it. Wall coverings were just a little dingy and a bit frayed here and there, the carpet on our floor was stretched out & wrinkled, woodwork had seen a few too many baggage carts bounced off, the plaster in the room had several cracks in it, the pop-up drain in the bathroom sink didn't work. All-in-all, as I said: Just sort of tired.Now, as Paul Harvey would say, 'the rest of the story: Beyond any shadow of a doubt, the staff was amazing! From front desk to housekeeping (our housekeeper (18th floor)was without a doubt one of the nicest, most outgoing and EFFICIENT I have run across lately...she always had a smile, always talked to my wife, asked if we needed anything, etc...OUTSTANDING), from the restaurant to the parking valets, the staff was among the best I have ever dealt with...courteous, obliging, they followed through, they were always outgoing and pleasant. For that reason alone, we will use the DoubleTree Alana - Waikiki again if we ever get to go back.

For that reason, we went to Target and purchased fans for all 4 of the hotel rooms we were occupying during this stay.

Valet parking only (32$/day) however 50% discount for Kamaaina's.Up a short escalator is the front desk. The front desk was very nice and efficient and check in process was a breeze. The best part about check in was the Warm Chocolate Chip cookies they give you! Such a small gesture but SO Yummy! We had a corner room 7th floor it was an (accessible room) so the shower was a walk in type not a tub. We had a city view and the balcony looked over Ala Moana Bl which was fine, i didn't need an ocean view. Pro's: -Warm Cookies on Arrival-50% Kamaaina discount on valet Parking-Room service is available and there is a small bar/restaurant in the lobby-Location is awesome walking distance to Ala Moana Mall, and other restaurants a few minutes away. (Waikiki Brewing company, Wailana coffee house, buffalo wild wings, Cinnamon's all close by)-Great customer service at the front desk-Room was clean and comfortable, toiletries were good but small size-Bed was Amazing one of the most comfortable that I've slept in at a hotel-Pool and fitness center in the hotel-Coffee maker in room-The have movies on Demand but the New Release ones are 17$ to watch-DID I MENTION Warm Chocolate Chip Cookies at Check in? I might stay again just to get some! Con's:-Although you can walk to the beach its not located directly across the street from the beach if that's what you are looking for.-Noise, I was on the 7th floor and unfortunately could hear ambulance, rubbish trucks, alarms from the room. Since the location is so central you might want a higher floor so that its quieter. -valet parking rate of 32$ is pretty expensive however most rates in Waikiki will be similar. Overall I would stay here again, the location was convenient for me and the bed was very comfortable. I didn't want to get out of bed at all.

The staff was nice and professional and asked us to try another room on the 16th floor. As soon as we opened the door to the room the smell was obviously worse than the first room. We went down and told the front desk we did not want to stay at the hotel. They insisted we try yet another room on the 18th floor.

I stayed on the 14th floor with an ocean view. This property is 1 of 2 ""company approved properties"" for Honolulu, the other being the Holiday Inn Beachcomber in the heart of Waikiki. First the pros:Great location. Away from the madness of Waikiki, but right up the road (maybe a 10 minute walk) from the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Anything you could possibly want is in the village.Very clean rooms and attentive staff. Everyone from the front desk to housekeeping was very friendly. Room refrigerator worked well. TV was fine - but who goes to Hawaii to watch TV?Trees Restaurant was very good. Restaurant staff was very friendly and they took the time to get to know their guests, as most guests are business travelers. The food was actually very good, and not overpriced like other onsite restaurants.Pool area was nice. Granted, most people aren't going to hang around the hotel pool when Waikiki is 2 blocks away, but I used the pool quite often and I enjoyed the peace and quiet.Cons: On-site parking is valet only. $32 per day. However, this is the norm around Waikiki.No on-site laundry facilities. You have 2 options: find a laundromat out in town, or use the hotel provided laundry service. I opted for the latter. Very pricey, but my clothes did come back pressed/neatly folded.2 of the 3 elevators were out of commission for a few days, which led to long wait times. By the time the elevator showed up at your floor (14th for me) it would be packed and you'd have to wait for the elevator to return and hope it wasn't as packed. They finally let us use the freight elevator to help alleviate this problem.Hotel room was extremely humid. Not sure if this is a hotel issue or just a part of life in Hawaii, but everything from the towels to the sheets always felt damp. My papers always had that ""damp paper"" feel as well. The A/C did work, but the humidity in the room was always very high.Wi-fi was down on on my floor for about 5 days. I did get a 50% discount on my parking during my stay, so my company saved a few hundred dollars on parking fees.Coffee maker in the room is your very basic model. Paper cups and generic coffee.Overall, this is a fine hotel. Just be sure to stop at Target to pick up a portable fan and a small coffee pot if you're on an extended stay.

There is a small fridge in the room to chill drinks etc too.The cost of room service was stupidly expensive and was unnecessarily expensive, in my opinion. On top of the cost of the food itself, there is a 22% gratuity charge and then another $5 charge; that made the cost of eggs benedict, for example, almost $28, which is just silly. Therefore, I didn't use room service and would encourage the hotel to review their pricing.The restaurant/bar is only open during peak hours (breakfast and dinner) and room service is therefore only available during these times; the bar was also closed outside of peak times. Plenty bars and restaurants in the local area though- Cheeseburger at the end of the street was a welcome place to go.Would definitely stay here again and would recommend the hotel.

So the assistant manager had the room recleaned. This made a total of four room changes.

I was told on arrival that there were no accessible rooms available. I was given a room with 2 beds. This would have worked out fine but...The space between the beds, doorway, etc. was very tight for a wheelchair. Okay, we could deal with this. The bathroom was tight and hard to get in an out of the shower because of the step up but there was a handrail and we could deal with that.I had to ask for a new room when the wall mounted sink started falling off the wall. I thought something was amiss when I placed the soap on the edge of the sink and it would not stay. Then I noticed how poorly it was mounted to the wall with large amounts of caulking on the back edge. The toilet then overflowed. I went down to discuss these issues with the manager. She said they were full and the next night we could change to an accessible room. We packed up the next day to change rooms. We found the accessible room to be a nice option but had a different issue. We needed a bed for our daughter. The rooms were remodeled and the couches removed. I asked for a rollaway bed and was informed that they had none on property at all. Okay, another room change and we had 2 beds and a bathroom that was at least accessible but with an old style tub. Hilton's promise is that they will make it right. I can say that 2 room changes and 2 nights and they got the room right, finally. I was offered an upgrade if I returned again. I planned to return to Waikiki in 2 weeks but will not choose this hotel again. I really do not expect to struggle this much for a Doubletree level accommodation. The pool area is small and not much fun. The workout room is acceptable. Location is good for beach access if you don't mind walking 3 -4 blocks. The property restaurant is okay. You will likely wait quite awhile for your food. As a Hilton Diamond member I usually get breakfast for free. I did get a continental breakfast for free, but if I wanted cooked eggs then there was an $8 charge. I have stayed at many Doubletree hotels that were far more hospitable and pleasant in far less scenic areas. I expected more from a Doubletree in Hawaii. I would recommend not renting a car.

We booked the partial ocean view and were in level 15. We were very happy with the view, it's not ocean front but it's also not ocean front price. The room had plenty of space, with a very comfortable bed and a new bathroom. Front reception staff are truly the best we have experienced in any Hilton/Doubletree and pretty much from any hotel. Michelle checked us in an out and deserves an award, super friendly and helpful. Really did make you feel welcome. The Valet staff could probably learn a bit from the reception staff, as they kinda ignore you as you walk past, no big deal though. Pool area is perfect, again the hotel is affordable so it's no lagoon pool but you are not paying resort fees. We used it everyday and had it to ourselves mostly. Only real problem we had was on the last two nights a guest checked-in in the adjacent room and they smoked on the balcony (pretty sure it wasn't a legal substance either) and the smell came into our room. That's not really the hotels fault but also they opened and closed their balcony door constantly over those two nights and it was very loud and woke us up several times. Other than this we loved our stay and it was the perfect distance for us to the main centre and beach, gets you away from the crowds but 10 min walk to most main attractions! If you don't like or unable to walk for 10 mins due to illness/age etc then you may need transport or cabs but I would still look at staying here as the service and comfort is great.

If you're looking for a hotel to sleep, a comfortable room, and a staff that seems to genuinely care about your stay there, then this for you. Pros: On the outskirts of Waikiki, so you don't have the traffic and hustle and bustle of Waikiki. Hilton resort is a 5 minute walk, and Waikiki beach is 10 minutesNice facility with comfortable rooms.Hotel went out of their way to accomodate us (father in law had a complaint about locks on bathrooms, and they did what they could to fix it).Cons:Some furniture dated and worn.No locks on bathrooms (this a hawaii thing?)Pool area is a little underwhelming",california,"matthewlau17</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>california</strong>",1,4.0

CONS: We had a city view which was a view of one of your typical, creepier looking Honolulu buildings (so consider upgrading to a view of the mountain if you go with the one bedroom suite). The room, although updated, didn't feel fresh because maybe it hadn't had a complete overhaul or had already seen a lot of traffic. (Maybe it was the color of the sofa, but I just didn't feel the couch cushions were clean feeling.) The two queen beds in the bedroom were packed in pretty tight, so good luck moving comfortably in the room with your check-in luggage. You also get no TV in the bedroom. No complimentary happy hours or entertainment. Finally, if I had paid ($233/night) rather than used points, I would've felt this was way overpriced, so if you can afford a little bit more at a better hotel, I'd do it--especially if you're hoping for a Hawaiian/resort type feel. (We moved on to the Embassy Suites after two days--because we lucked out with a flash sale--and it was a 180 experience.)PROS: Friendly staff, fast valet, 10-15min walking distance from the strip and Waikiki beach (but may be a bit much of a walk for young children, elderly people, or someone in cute heels, so uber is handy if you stay here), and more ""affordable"" than hotels in the heart of the strip. Best thing I could say about this hotel though (besides the yummy cookies!) was BEST SOFA BED MATTRESS EVER!! This mattress was more comfortable than most regular beds--it almost had a memory foam feel. We just kept the mattress open the entire time and lay on it instead of the couch cushions. (I always take pictures of my hotel rooms and didn't do it for this one, so that kind of tells you how not so thrilled I was about the appearance of our room...)","Fountain Valley, California","HappyB414</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fountain Valley, California</strong>",56,3.0

We called management and they informed us the air conditioning would be out for the next four days. So for half of our stay we had temperatures in the room of 78 to 82 deg F.

Purely and simply, The Staff! Each and every one of them...bell staff, valet, front desk, restaurant, housekeeping, maintenance and management. I have always known that if you want your staff to provide excellent service and treat customers well, it has to start at the top. Well, it is evident that it starts at the top here at the Doubletree Alana. Service is impeccable and everyone goes out of their way to greet you and make your stay comfortable. I don't care where you stay on this island, you are not going to find a perfect product, but I can tell you, if you stay at the Doubletree, when and if you run across an issue, it will be addressed quickly, efficiently and with the utmost care. This staff has the best follow through and makes you feel like you are important. When my husband and I checked in for our 9 day stay, I was laughing at my now nearly non existent HHonors status of blue since I have not been traveling this past year and a half; I had previously been a Diamond since 2001. I was remarking how I am nothing now but still happy to be an HHonors member. We are now on our 4th day at this hotel and I have to tell you, this staff has treated us so well, made us feel special. As a matter of fact, in all my previous years of staying at other Hilton properties, I can't remember a time of ever receiving such great personal service. This property is very quiet and only a couple of blocks away from the beach. I like that it is not nestled in with all the chaos of other Waikiki hotels. It is an easy walk from many great restaurants and 2 minutes away from two ABC stores in either direction. A huge bonus is that you are not charged a resort fee to stay at this property. If you stay at any other resort, you will need to add on at least an additional 30.00 per day to your hotel rate. And that does not include parking. There is a nice gym with Precor equipment and a view of the pool as you run off your Happy Hour Mai Tai's from the day before. If you are looking for impersonal service, large crowds, and over rated non service then do not stay here, but if you want personal service, caring and thoughtful staff who jump through hoops for their customers, then the Doubletree Alana is a 'Must Stay'. Hendrick, the Assistant Front Desk Manager, is the epitome of follow through and excellent service. I see a future General Manager in this fine young man. Thanks, Hendrick!

Reservation was for Saturday-Thursday. We had a conference room reserved for a class we would be teaching through the week. We had our teaching supplies shipped to the hotel & were told at check-in to stop by the valet and they would get our boxes out of their hold cage. Sunday afternoon, I went down to pick up our boxes which had nearly $2000 in supplies in them. After nearly 30 minutes, I was told they could not locate them and they would let us know as soon as they found them. We never heard from anyone Sunday evening. Monday, the day our class started, still no boxes. We asked for some highlighters from the front desk, as they were part of the supplies we were missing. They were not very happy at our request, stating that those were the ones THEY used. We did our best with what we had, feeling less professional since we didn't have all of our class materials. Thankfully, our attendees were very understanding. The conference room was very noisy (it's a very busy area) & the lobby music was playing so loudly that people were having trouble concentrating. Tuesday, still NO boxes! They were nice enough to turn the music down since there was a speaker right outside the door (until the next shift came on & then it was cranked back up). I had to go buy calculators, pens, and pencils for the class at a 7-Eleven nearby that morning so we could get through our topics that day. Tuesday evening, we informed the front desk that we would be finished our class ahead of schedule and would be checking out Wednesday. They were going to charge us $100 for the early checkout until one of them noticed we were Hilton Diamond Members,so they waived that fee. Wednesday morning we packed up & dropped our things off with the valet and went to finish our class - still no boxes. I will say that the events manager, Jacob, did search the hotel high & low for our packages. He was in contact with us throughout this situation. The kicker is, this was not the first time this happened at this hotel, but the THIRD! Every trip for the same class, at the same hotel...they lost our supplies! On top of that two of the three elevators were not working most of our stay. And our room, while it had a partial ocean view, was a hefty downgrade from the room we had had previously. The sink was just a bowl mounted to the wall and angled downward so that you couldn't even set your toothbrush on it. We were both shocked that this was what they offered to their Diamond guests. I mention that again for a reason. After all of this, we were offered Hilton Points for our inconvenience. We were dumbfounded! This reservation was in my mother's name & she had over one million points at this time. What kind of compensation is that?! I was told that seemed reasonable since we were on business and must be reimbursed for all of our expenses. Wrong! When you own your own business, you don't get reimbursed for anything - it's all out of pocket! In the end, we were given a nominal amount refunded for our headaches. That amount barely covered one day in the conference room and didn't even touch the cost of our room. We would like to say thank you to sweet Elsa, who was at the front desk through most of this fiasco. She was very nice & as helpful as she could be. We did later find out that the hotel had shipped our packages out on Saturday. There was zero record of this anywhere. They did acknowledge this was a policy that needed to be corrected to prevent this from happening again. We were apologized to time and time again, but it just wasn't enough after a three-peat. We have a couple additional classes out there this year in which we had planned to stay at the Double Tree. We will not be giving them any more of our business.","Marion, Illinois","travel9903</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Marion, Illinois</strong>",3,2.0

I've never been at a DoubleTree that felt so poorly managed and maintained as this hotel. Unfortunately, we booked this hotel for our honeymoon, and to say we were disappointed with our experience would be an understatement. First, a full breakfast is charged as a $8 upgrade for Diamond members-- what?! Since they couldn't provide a room upgrade for our honeymoon, I argued that at the very least they could upgrade our breakfast. I'm not sure why I had to ask for this (it's usually a standard benefit for Diamonds), but I did, and reluctantly, the front desk manager in duty agreed to do it... but not until I asked for it. So that was the start of our honeymoon vacation! Unfortunately, I didn't exactly know what I as asking for... the breakfast gave us diarrhea on 3 of our days. The restaurant was disgustingly dirty, and very poorly managed. Servers wore dirty uniforms and clearly weren't trained on how to offer a clean environment. Seeing how dirty the front of the house was, I can't imagine how disgusting the kitchen was-- but we didn't have to imagine, because we were made sick, which really ruined our honeymoon vacation. I'm reporting the hotel to the health department, because I'm quite sure they are in violation of health code.$30 per day to park your car, and there are no other options. You are required to valet your car. Sorry, but $30 a day is more than I paid for our rental car! That's a disgusting ripoff. Nothing like feeling you were ripped off by your hotel. And by the way, that doesn't include tips for valet staff... At that rate, the gratuity should certainly be included (but it's not). So expect to pay $35-45 per day to park at your hotel.The entire property was dated, dingy and dirty. The furniture in our room had stains. The mini fridge did not work. The replacement fridge showed up with black mold all over the door. The elevators weren't cleaned once (properly) during our weeklong stay-- gross! We just didn't want to touch anything in this hotel, because you could tell it was never cleaned properly.When we reported all of this, the front desk manager did apologize. And she told us they would finally upgrade us to a ""suite"". We got to our ""suite"" later that night only to find that it was in fact a downgrade. They wanted to give us HALF of a suite, with a pull down queen size Murphy bed (read kids bed). No thanks!

And this stay has to rate as the worst one. I booked online with the additional option of upgrading at a discounted rate to their ""Penthouse"" suite. The listing on their website makes it appear grander than what you potentially get. On their website, they show a large room plus state that you get 2 balconies and they also show a private sun deck. And all of this is on their top floor leading one to believe you are getting something worthwhile. What they fail to tell you is that the sundecks are only if you get the rooms at the end of the hallway. So while I did get a Penthouse suite, all it meant was I had a separate bedroom from the living area and located on the 19th floor. In other words, something I would have received at an Embassy Suites or Homewood Suites. And let's not mention that the room smelled of dog. As for their breakfast, I skipped it even though I had a coupon. They have 2 types of breakfast, either continental or full buffet. With my coupon, I could only get the continental or pay $8.00 extra for the buffet. And the staff there is watching you like a hawk. I saw them go stand right next to a guy that was taking his buffet to go and not leave his side until he paid. This was my first stay here and my last.

We own a timeshare with Hilton, and typically stay at one of their Waikiki properties, but none were available on short notice.We chose the DoubleTree as a good alternative, close to the beach, close to shopping and close to the main part of Waikliki Beach.The hotel, while older, was well maintained, and seemed to have been remodeled in recent history. The lobby is a short escalator ride up from the entrance drive, with the restaurant on that level as well. There is an outdoor pool and seating area on the mezzanine level. While we didn't swim in the pool, the area was clean and we sit poolside to relax and read.Our room was medium sized, with a small refrigerator but no microwave oven, something that would have been handy. It was clean, and the housekeepers were conscientious and accommodating, bringing extra shampoo and conditioner for my daughter.As Hilton Hhonors members, we received a free continental breakfast each day. It was typical fare - breads, hot and cold cereal, fruit, yogurt, juices and coffee, with the option to convert to a full breakfast for an additional charge. Quality was good (especially the muffins and croissants), and service was quick.The big drawback for me was the limitation on parking. All parking is valet parking, and the attendants asked each afternoon if we would be going out again that evening, presumably to park vehicles two deep in the parking structure. It made for less spontaneity and longer wait times. That, and the parking charge ($30 per day at the time of our visit) were off-putting.I would definitely stay here again.","Phoenix, Arizona","hate2wait</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",41,4.0

It is centrally located (but not on the beach and you can only glimpse the beach from the balcony if you're above the 10th floor or so.) Yes, it has the requisite cookies, but I'm not a fan of chocolate chip, so not a huge perk for me. Since I'm not a Hilton Diamond member, the hotel had no perks-no free coffee downstairs, no free breakfast, no free water. The hotel has some good points-central location, prompt valet service, and great bartender/servers in the restaurant, but the inconsistent service overall marred my stays. I called down to order room service the day I arrived and although I called several times over an hour, no one ever answered the phone. I decided to walk to ABC and get a salad instead (which was actually very good.) I was willing to give room service another try a few days later by ordering the continental breakfast delivered to my room at a set time-how can you mess that up? Well, you can if the food never arrives. I stopped in at the Front Desk in the afternoon to mention it and the lady simply looked at me--didn't even say I'm sorry-it was kind of odd. I then said I wanted to ensure I wasn't charged for anything and she double-checked and told me I hadn't been-then looked at me again. Very weird-it was like she was programmed not to say I'm sorry for anything. Call me crazy, but I tried again and actually got dinner to go once from the bar (fish and chips that was delicious). I ate in the bar a few times after that when I didn't feel like heading out for dinner and all of the meals were delicious and fast. Buoyed by my success, I decided to try the continental breakfast delivery again, and while it came to my door on time, it contained only coffee and juice. When I told the very nice man I had ordered the complete breakfast, he told me to hang on a few minutes and then brought me back double of everything at no charge and was effusive in his apologies. The valet service was also inconsistent--it was always fast, but not always pleasant. I realize that's not a great job, but a few times the guys at the counter were almost hostile. (It's also $30 per night to park-you have to pay to park anywhere in Waikiki, but this is at the high end of what I've ever paid.) Maid service was also all over the road. I think I had a great maid once, but the rest appeared to do nothing but change the towels and make the bed-some left trash in the trash cans, others didn't refill the used coffee supplies or provide new shampoo bottles, etc. Finally, my room smelled a bit like wet dog, at least that was my first impression. I thought it might've been a room that hadn't been used lately, but one of my coworkers mentioned the funky smell in her room, too. Not sure what it meant, but I got some air freshener that I used liberally and hoped I wasn't breathing in black mold living in the walls or something. All-in-all, I don't plan to stay here again unless I absolutely can't find anything else.","Millersville, Maryland","mommyb523</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Millersville, Maryland</strong>",30,3.0

The lobby/public spaces are utilitarian and clean - but you're not in Hawaii to sit around your hotel lobby or restaurant, right? Rooms have a slight tropical smell - not dirty, just that little bit of mustiness you get in any room in a humid climate where they feel the need to have carpets in the rooms. I had two different rooms because it was a split stay, and both had this - but I got used to it quickly and there really wasn't anything else about the room to remind me of it once I'd adjusted. Comfy bed, decent view (not like breathtaking oceanic splendor, but ocean was visible between hi-rises. Bathrooms were really quite nice - took a sec to figure out how the shower knobs worked, but actually a clever system once you catch on. Glass doors to the shower, no tub. Very clean all the way around. If I go to Honolulu again on business, I'd be glad to stay here again. One warning for those going to Honolulu for the first time: rush hour traffic is nuts. Staying close to downtown so we didn't have to use the freeway at those times was a big plus, but I wouldn't stay here if I were working over by Pearl Harbor - just too far at commuting times.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Rohrbach</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",18,4.0

Of course, you do have free Wifi in your room if you are a HHonors member and book direct. There was also a microwave in the business center that guests can use to heat up dinners or leftovers. The gym was nice and kept clean. There were 2 treadmills, 3 Elipticials and 1 bike as well as a few weights. The pool area was a little small, but the water seemed warm (I did not use it but tested the water). The room was basic but clean. The refrigerator is small and can really only hold a few drinks.

As Hilton diamond members, we had no special treatment, and also had to pay $8 to upgrade our complementary continental breakfast to a full hot breakfast- even when I asked at the front desk. ""That's the policy of this hotel""- but not Hilton policy.

The staff was always friendly and helpful and we had breakfast in the on-site restaurant once, which was decent. The hotel is close to the main walking and dining areas in Waikiki, but you really do need a car to get to decent snorkeling, hiking, etc. We decided to upgrade our room upon arrival and had a partial water view with lots of greenery (I think it was room 1611). Having a balcony was wonderful, as we could enjoy the view and allow our wet swimsuits and towels to dry outside. We also appreciated having a small refrigerator, coffee maker and microwave, but did not use them often. We had very few issues, but we found the walls to be very thin and could hear EVERYTHING in the hallways and nearby rooms. This included doors slamming at all hours, which was pretty jarring in the middle of the night. Additionally, we slept in our first morning after arriving and, as a result, our room did not get cleaned that day. We had to track down the cleaning staff the next day and ensure that our room would not be missed again, as we were desperate for new towels and for our trashcans to be emptied.

Yes, but it wasn't perfect, though it could have been.*Positive: Breakfast - the food is fresh (except the pastries were a bit dry and juice was reconstituted).

B'fast from 6am, including take away if you have an early start or they can prepare a continental for you if you need it before 6am. Well stocked through to 10am (one of our party tested this).Size of room including bathroom - Room (1105) really good size for 2A and 2C (teen & pre teen). Plenty of storage space. Shower okay but would have been nice if a bit wider; plenty of length. Shower head beautiful.Lifts - (We were on the 11th floor) Great until the weekend when things got super busy then slow (obviously).Valet - Oh my, what friendly, beautiful, kind, lovely people. Thank you, thank you!Bar including evening restaurant - Oh, Earl, you are a beautiful person; so friendly and contributed to but never dominated conversation and no tall tales. Just a genuinely lovely person. Restaurant/bar was very handy when some of our party fell ill (totally unrelated to the accommodation/restaurant); healthy people could eat close by to those who stayed in the room due to ill health. Front desk - Helpful and patient except for a charging problem I'll address below.Street access - Easy entry driving and walking though signage for the hotel was set back from the street. We were dropped off by shuttle so this wasn't a problem but if arriving under your own steam, trust the GPS.Bag storage after check out - Yes and easy to collect (deposit and collect through valet).Pool area - spacious and a good sized pool including outdoor seating however, it is outdoors so if using the seating to relax, you'll need to take refuge when the showers come. Plenty of towels, near the gym, for pool use.Housekeeping - friendly and quick. Accommodated my needs due to illness.*Neutral:Bed - Too soft for us but it didn't dip. Feather bedding was lovely to sleep under.Gym - Can't comment as we're not gym users but it was there and there were plenty of towels.Location - Not close to Waikiki central but close enough to eateries, really close to car hire and we didn't have to drive through the horrible Waikiki traffic.View - We had ocean view. It is partial, through the gaps in a few buildings and set back well from the beach but the ocean is there. Outlook is over the main road (Ala Moana Blvd)*Negative: Charging - I had prepaid the room, which included wifi & breakfast. We didn't check in with a car. We were asked for a c/card at check in for ""incidentals"". A $200 hold was applied to the card but I wasn't told this would occur or the value of the hold. I noted this hold a day or 2 later and enquired at reception why so much was held. I was told the reason was not known & I'd need to speak to the staff member who created the transaction, I wasn't told how to contact this staff member so I emailed the Hilton Doubletree directly for an explanation but didn't receive a reply (email sent almost 2 weeks ago at the time of writing).

It was at the Hilton on the beach so we stayed in a really nice suite at the Doubletree for the same rate as the conference rates at the Hilton. We had a room with two double beds that had a sitting room with a pullout couch that was separated by a pocket door and the bathroom had access from either the bedroom area or the sitting room. It was perfect for three adults, one young boy (on the pullout) and our daughter in her crib. Everyone at the hotel was super helpful, our room was clean. We didn't have the best Hawaii view but for us we had a better view. Our room was immediately above the pool so my wife or I could swim with one kid while the other supervised the other napping in the room and we could chat back and forth from the balcony. The wifi was great we had three devices going all the time with no trouble. I had to get a suit dry-cleaned ( I know a suit in Waikiki, I was there for work remember) and they got it back to me next day and perfect. We didn't eat much at the lobby lounge but enjoyed what we did. Romeo was training at the bar and was a hoot.

It's not right on the beach, but I don't mind; it's just a quick walk down the street and through the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Parking is valet and fairly easy in/easy out. The rooms have modern decor, including updated bathrooms. This last time I had a room on the fifth floor right along Ala Moana Blvd. The patio was extended since it was above the pool, but there was increased noise from the nearby intersection. I had stayed on the 11th floor closer to the Ena Rd side during my previous stay and didn't notice any noise. I have noticed the rooms and hallways can get warm and a little humid depending on the day. I've chalked it up to less than ideal air circulation. I wouldn't say it's a problem per se and it obviously hasn't deterred me from coming back! I ate at the hotel restaurant during my first stay here (summer of 2013) and thought the food was good--perfect for getting a quick bite after a long day of flying. Bottom line--I like the ease of staying here. It's less chaotic than the resorts and the staff has always been kind to me.","Madison, Wisconsin","lmmwi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Madison, Wisconsin</strong>",15,4.0

The pool was nice with comfortable sunbeds and parasols. Once we had been checked in we went up to our room on floor 14 which faced the sea. The room was clean and had everything you needed. The hotel is situated on one of the main roads so traffic noise was a bit of a problem.

If you are a hotel near a beach, or if you have a pool, one towel/guest/day is just not sufficient. Chances are someone is going to use the beach or pool and will need to take more than one shower in a day.2. The first day having the ""complimentary"" breakfast was fine - good food choices - the waitress was lovely - no problems with the grand daughter who was below the age of needing a ticket ( which you were given when you checked in).....the next morning our daughter was charged for our granddaughters ""complimentary"" breakfast. Not sure if the rules changed or the fact our granddaughter was 1 day older is what caused the rules to change. And the waitress would not bring anyone out to discuss this change in policy.3. Within a few hours of checking in we recieved a copy of a reciept showing OUR credit card had been used to to pay for a stay in the room the night before - for some woman in Indiana. They had to track down the on duty manager to fix this - which they eventually did - with no explanation of why or how it occcured4. Our daughter had used reward points to book the rooms yet HER credit card was used the next day to pay for OUR room. Again they had to find a manager who eventually fixed it - but again could not explain why or how this occurred.These last two issues made us very wary of what was going on int the hotel and we kept close eyes on our CC bills. Not sure if they did not expect people to pick up these mistakes so quickly of if they were honest mistakes. It was interesting to overhear a discussion that at 5 PM they were having to take mashed potatoes off the menu for the night since the steamer broke and they had no other way to prep the potatoes for mashing. Even the wait staff was taken aback about thisWiFi was spotty - even with all the directions provided could not keep a signal in the roomAlso - it would have been nice if there had been some some of information - in the room or at check in - as to where all the facilities were located. We finally found a map in the lobby which told us where the pool was.....but no information about it at all.

We stayed 4 days with a tour group. The front desk was always attentive and pleasant. It is about a 10 minute walk to the beach and since it is a Hilton entity, you can use the pool at the more expensive Hilton about a 5 minute walk away. The parking was $30.00 a day but you have unlimited in/out valet and they were quick and pleasant each trip. I had a convertible and left the top down without any issue or concern in the covered garage. One evening when it rained they put it up for me ""just in case"" which was nice. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable with a small balcony for two. If possible, while reserving a room I would ask for the view away from the beach and above the 10th floor. There is a nice view of the skyline and mountains from that side. There is not a beach view that I could see on the other side which is where our room was on both stays. We saw the other view from my sister-in-laws room. If you want a beach view this isn't the place. I didn't plan or actually stay in the room much so that wasn't a bother.

Cordial not friend but not cold either. Just right. Breakfast was just right. Actually, I had the best Omelette in a long time here.ROOM DESIGN: Efficient and plenty of room to move around. Cool views from the balcony. ROOM CLEANING: Clean but not SPIC N SPAN. Missing the simple things. So so. Beds were made. Bathroom picked and replenished. But, here are the list of the misses: 1) garbage can not emptied;2) paper left on the floor and counter (yes, I rushed out for a tour but expected better)3) hand towel in shower never removed (thus, most likely hot cleaned)ROOM WELCOME BINDER: Inner materials ... upside down. Like opening a book with the Title one way while the contents placed upside down. Really? Missing on the easy stuff.INTERNET: Speed ok. Good luck on securing support if you have to make a 4AM connection. Figured it out once reboot was completed (upon the local team's recommendation).AFTER HOURS / FRONT DESK: Called the Front Desk a couple of times. Let the phone ring 11 times one of the calls. Since I wasn't getting and response, I phoned the DIAMOND 800#. REMODELING: Be ready. But, you can figure your way around. They did a good job mapping things out to guide you thru.CONCIERGE: Two thumbs up!! The ""really"" young lady was totally BUTTONED UP!!! Loved the Helicopter and my private driver land tour.VIEW: Great city view. Spend some time on the balcony.Would love to give you a higher rating but I am bummed. I actually believe that you have a good location, nice team, and potentially a great product. Tough to pay what I paid then feel good about the lack of attention to details.

It was large enough for this 3-night visit. The aqua blue colors were annoying, but I'm guessing it fits the local flavor. The carpet seemed like the indoor-outdoor type. The bed was comfortable; the bathroom was small; the furniture seemed dated. The room was somewhat cool, but I couldn't get the room to a much cooler temperature that I preferred. If you're not planning to spend a lot of time in the room, it's sufficient. This was not a comfortable or inviting room where you'd want to spend a lot of time. I used it as a pit-stop, i.e., I didn't spend much time in the room during this long weekend visit.Breakfast: The space was cramped; overrun with people; tables not cleared sufficiently; and food was average at best. Don't expect much here.Common areas: I didn't see much of the hotel. The hallways had a musty smell, but I think that had to do with the humidity. The entrance to the hotel was under renovation which made the whole scene chaotic. Overall, the hotel seems like an older property that needs a 21st century update.Location: Good location; everything is walkable.","San Francisco, California","Apollo P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",154,2.0

I do dislike the new doubletree shower amenities the shampoo is crap. Staff was always happy and helpful. Really liked the male bar tender, forgot his name but it was clear he loved his job. I did go back a few time and it was because of his happy service. You can do an easy walk over to the massive Hilton Hawaiian Village for food and shopping and all the people.

The hotel seems older, but they are obviously updating it with the renovation of the front entrance which is barricaded off making it a little difficult if you have a vehicle. First and foremost all of the staff I encountered were incredibly friendly and hospitable. I had a room facing inland. It was clean, comfortable and the sleep quality good. Each room has a small balcony. The bathroom was pretty spacious for a regular room which I really liked. What I did not like was the AC in the room, while cool... did not allow you to go below 68-69. I like it cooler at night so that was a con. The hallways were uber hot, no air flow at all including in the elevators which would not have been an issue had it not been 90 degrees plus. I did order room service one evening, and it was pretty decent food. All and all it was a comfortable stay... nothing more nothing less. While I would probably stay here again if I was able to get such a good rate again, I did find the beachfront properties more enticing. My colleagues were staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for maybe 15 bucks more a night than here and they were given meal/food vouchers and the property was chock full of services.","Tucson, Arizona","betsnow</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tucson, Arizona</strong>",120,3.0

Didn't really know what to expect as this was my fist time here. They sent me a courtesy e-mail letting me know that they had renovations going on and that I'd have to park across the street so that was good to know so that I can plan out my daily activities. I pulled up and the valet and bell men were so welcoming and so eager to be of service, it was GREAT! We walked in and went up the escalators and while I was standing in line my eyes roamed the lobby area. I was very impressed as everything was very organized, clean and smell...my friends very important to me was very nice. It was finally my turn and as I walk up the lady that checked me in was so kind and made it so easy to get me in and up to my room fast. I drove an hour to get here so I really appreciated that. I wanna say it took less than 5 mins.  Get into the elevators and head to our room. It was very easy to find out room(don't you hate when you get into a hotel and have the hardest time finding your room or what tower). My kids enjoyed the smell of the hallways...they said it reminded them of my yummy lip gloss hahahahahaha. It really did smell good though. We walked into our room and was very impressed with the decor and pieces in the room. Everything was very updated and clean. Everything worked so that was great too. Our AC was working very well and with the crazy hurricane heat we've been having it was PERFECT to walk into a cool room and just drop into a down comforter(like a bed of clouds). Beds were very comfy and cozy. We got a city view and the bad was not bad at all. I did sit on my balcony and enjoy the fresh air a few times. The housekeeper that came in the next day was so nice and very patient as we had slept in and we didn't feel rushed at all to start our day. When we got back that morning right after she had cleaned the room I noticed I had a message on my phone...thinking to myself, who would be calling me on the hotel line? I couldn't believe who it was....the Concierge at the Front Desk....are you kidding me??? I just couldn't believe the service. I thought that was an awesome addition to all the attention to details that this hotel had done thus far. I felt so VIP.  I love to go to the gym so of course I checked it out and I was in LOVE!!! You overlook the pool so it was perfect to watch my kids through the glass. My kids are older so they're pretty well behaved and can swim on their own so it was PERFECT! The gym was nice and cool and had more than enough equipment to get a great workout in. Lots of room and I liked that it was so clean and organized. The pool was great of course my kids took full advantage of it and I really enjoyed that it was nice and warm even in the evening. Clean, warm towels were always available near the pool so we were able to stay clean and dry. The view from the pool was gorgeous and it did help that we had Mr.Sun that came out to play this weekend. There were enough chairs for everyone that came to enjoy the pool and even umbrellas for those like me who started to feel the sun was a little too strong at times.  We had the breakfast buffet at the Trees Restaurant and Bar. The spread was HUGE! I'm a pescatarian and there were lots of options for me. My fav had to be the omelette station and the waffles :) But the options were endless! I rarely see my hub looking like a kid in a candy shop...he didn't know where to start and stop hahahaha it was great to see him enjoy it especially since we were there enjoying our Anniversary. Oh and since I'm talking about food....can I say WHAT the COOKIEgasm?? Yeah, I said it LOL The cookies they have here were AMAZING!!! I would go there just for the cookies hahahahahaha no but really the cherry on top to tie in everything.  I have to end with naming a few people that stood out to me and really helped to make my stay so much more special. Clinton Yamashita played such a huge roll in creating such a memorable experience for our first staycation in Waikiki since our honeymoon 10 years ago. It was so good, we have decided to as a couple and family to make sure we come back every so often throughout the year. There was also a Jacob at the Front Desk that helped every time we came in super late (11:45pm and later) with any requests that we had and with a smile. I was thinking to myself...WOW even at the crack of midnight this guy is servicing us as if it was 8am in the morning and he just had a great big cup of coffee LOL I really appreciated that service especially when it was so late and I was so tired. I feel bad that I didn't get all the valet/bell guys but one that I do remember especially on our way out was Jeff. We had our kids towards the end of our stay and he was such a gentleman in making sure he had all our doors open and shut them for us. What service!!!! I tell you SERVICE here ROCKED MY SOCKS!!!

Unfortunately there was a lot of construction going on at the time, so the outside was not very pretty to look at. Also, the elevators were QUITE frustrating. Sometimes, they opened on random floors, and it was always very, VERY slow. I was up on a high floor, and there was no indication on what floor the elevators were at. Also, the elevators themselves were VERY small and cramped as well. I would never want to be caught when there is a rush of people coming in or out, because you would have to wait forever.Be aware that they were very strict about early check-in. It may be a different story if you call ahead to request it (and if you think you need it, I suggest you call to check), but we had to wait until their standard 3pm check-in time before they allowed us into the room as we had arrived a little earlier than expected. There was absolutely no wiggle room. The employees also didn't seem quite as happy. Upon rolling my luggage out of the room and waiting at the elevator, a lady from housekeeping who was cleaning another room, asked quite abrasively what room I was in and if I was checking out. I told her that I was leaving, but another friend had the room still, and she gave me this weird look. It was a bit strange.Parking is valet only (free if validated at the front desk that you stayed at the hotel). They offer some food credit at the restaurant downstairs for not requesting room service for a certain number of days (I believe 3?). I only stayed one day, so I didn't really read into, but it seemed like a good deal at the time. The fridge was nice and spacious, and there was a small single-serve coffee maker (with room for up to two cups to be brewed at once). Ice machines are on every other floor. There was supposedly also a microwave somewhere downstairs in the lobby that you could use to reheat leftovers.There were lots of places within walking distance, including an ABC store, 7-Eleven, lots of restaurants and shopping. I would not recommend driving around Waikiki unless you know there is parking available at your destination.The room was clean, but with construction, slow elevators and the somewhat unfriendly employees who seemed more annoyed than anything that I was there, I would rate this location a 3/5. I would still recommend that if anyone does stay at this location, they might want to consider joining the Hilton HHonors Program for the perks, including free wifi. The proximity to everything was nice, but there are lots of ways to get around Waikiki.","Los Angeles, California","VioletBijou</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",3,3.0

My VerizonWireless gave us enough speed to watch Netflix, which theirs would never do. it's good enough for basic surfing and email though, so if that's what you need, you're good with the basic.And to end it all, it's quite reasonable a price, even with paying $30/day for valet-only parking. Hilton resorts would be double the room rate, at least, and you can walk their, use their beaches, use their Starbucks, etc.We'd come back here again.","Willow Grove, Pennsylvania","Bruce H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Willow Grove, Pennsylvania</strong>",1,4.0

However, having stayed at the Double Tree in New York I had high expectations, this hotel while adequate did not meet my expectations. The staff were helpful and very good at apologising for the various issues, but it did not really help. One issue was the internet speed, I tested the speed and it was Ping 285ms, Down at 0.30Mbps and up at 0.17Mbps so uploading anything was really difficult. This is not a business speed at all. As a HHonors member it was free but it was easier to pay and use my data connection. The Hotel did offer a higher speed at $14 extra but as I was only using it at night to upload my notes and spreadsheets I decided not to pay. If they offer free service it should be a reasonable speed. At about the same price you get a suite in New York so I was expecting something similar but this was just a small room but it was acceptable for just one person. The bathroom was of the most basic I have even seen in this class of hotel, no shelf space near the washbasin at all. I would not stay here again.

I had to go up to the bar and tell them that I wanted coffee and water. Once I finally got my coffee they never came back to my table to fill up my cup. The worst service here is their valet drivers. When they brought me my car one morning I noticed that there was some extensive damage done to it. There were dents and scratches on both front doors, the small panel that is below the doors on the passenger side had a huge gash (an inch or 2 deep and about 2 feet long). This piece was so loose that it was about ready to fall off. There was some damage done to the front bumper as well. They parked my car so close to other cars that you couldn't even open the door to get out. When discussing this with the hotel manager, security guard, and police officer they kept asking me if maybe I hit something without knowing it. They were just trying to cover their own employees butt. They were not going to take any responsibility for the damage that was done to my vehicle. They would not credit me for some of the parking charges either. I sent several emails to one of the hotel managers asking him for reimbursement for some of the parking charges.

A bathtub that small should just be ripped out and made into a shower.I would never stay here again.

Our room was on floor five on the corner and had a wide balcony, where we ate breakfast and most dinners.

If you do, check with hotel about completion dates.We had been in Waikiki/Honolulu before and had a rental car then and paid $30/night for parking. This time we did without a rental car.

During our BANQUET, where you would assume a facility should prepare to have additional staffing, our bar had to close numerous times so that the bartenders could assist with serving food. Of course, we can't be rude and walk around while speakers are presenting, but when you're notified that the bar will close five minutes into the dancing/social portion, that becomes frustrating. On another note, the elevator situation was horrible, bring that they were small and that one was constantly out of service, again, during a very busy and expected event. The high point to this hotel is indeed the friendly staff, who REALLY worked hard to accommodate and make up for the lack of preparation and facility issues.

Our experience at this property was above and beyond my expectations. We were greeted with ""Aloha!"" and received warm cookies at check-in, one for each of us. Every staff member we encountered was very nice and friendly, and service was superb. The hotel was in the middle of renovation when we stayed (the lobby was blocked off in places and the drive-up was inaccessible) so we probably didn't get a great idea of the lobby, but what we saw was nice. The guestrooms appear to have been very recently renovated, and they were beautiful and functional. I especially liked the desk lamp, and the alarm clock has a USB plug in back to charge your phone. A nice. and needed, touch. There's a decorative frosted window between the bathroom and bedroom which is a nice touch, but it does let a lot of light through so it can disturb your roommates if you need the restroom at night. A minor quip, though. My only complaint was that the thermostat in the room was of the motion-sensing type. Ordinarily I think this is an awesome idea (why heat/cool a room so much when no one's in there?), but the thermostat in our room didn't seem to recognize that the room was occupied--it only sensed motion. We'd enter the room and the A/C would kick on, but when we went to bed after a half hour or so it would shut off because there was no movement. I slept a little warmly because of this, though admittedly I like the room very cool. Location of the hotel is great, just a short walk to Waikiki and also to the Hilton Hawaiian Village resort which is a great place to explore. Don't expect great views, though. Our room faced the mountains but there's another building very close to this one that dominates the view. I'm not sure what you can see on the other side of the building, but even a sub-par view in Hawaii is better than most anywhere else! I can't comment on parking since we did not bring a vehicle. Overall, a great stay. If they get better thermostats in there, I'd say a perfect stay!","Elmhurst, United States","Alec W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Elmhurst, United States</strong>",0,5.0

This started from the staff behind the front desk (a very warm thank you to Rebecca) all the way to the cleaning staff and valets. They made the stay truly a wonderful experience. Upon check on, I had encountered issues with my credit card, and Rebecca did her utmost to make sure that our stay would not be hampered by a little banking issue. Upon rectifying the issue, and some of those awesome cookies, our first overseas family holiday went on without incident.The cleaning staff were very accomodating, and when we were not ready to have the room serviced, they would smile, say ""not to worry"" and would return like cleaning angels and have our room done when we were out. The rooms were of a good standard, but carrying the name Hilton, I may have had my standards aimed a little too high? It slept a family of five with relative comfort but space was a little small. Perhaps smaller bathroom to have a larger bedroom? The hotel was close to most amenities including the beach. The pool was heated but on the small side and the gym seemed functional. The restuarant was a little light on menu and the meals where a little underwhelming. A small issue of ongoing construction at the front of the hotel lost that ""front of house"" appeal, but easily negotiated via the valet parking ramp. I am sure that the improvements will help the hotel. But overall the stay was pleasant but the staff were beyond expectation and really made the stay enjoyable and without incident.

The DoubleTree Alana Waikiki is more on a par with a 30-year old Holiday Inn. It makes me wonder what chain owned this property before Hilton took over.The rooms were nothing special. Each room has a small balcony with a pair of chairs and drink table. The desk is okay, the chair comfortable, but lacking enough nearby outlets. I thought the bed was fine, with a choice of pillow firmness, but others weren't as happy. The bathroom is tiny, but with a pretty cool shower. At least there is a wealth of storage space, with an armoire, a settee with drawers, adjacent shelves and cabinets in addition to four drawers below the 40-inch TV. The rooms seemed clean enough, and tastefully appointed, except for the wall repair which had not been painted. This room should not have been sold until that was fixed. My ""City View"" room was more like a dumpster and tenement-view. I checked the, ""Ocean View"" room a co-worker had, and if you leaned far enough and had binoculars, you might see the ocean. I might have been able to get a better room, if I had the Hilton app on my phone, except it is not compatible with my cutting-edge smart phone. Still no word on when Hilton's Apple-fanboy developers will fix this problem for the majority of smart phone users.The public areas were pretty dismal. The doors on my floor, had shoe marks, or were missing paint. On the HHonors floor, the doors were at least covered with 70s-vintage wood grain contact paper. Speaking of the 70s, the hallway carpeting was spot-on for retro night. The lobby was cramped, and under construction, so ingress and egress was only through the garage, which gouged guests to the tune of $30 a night. I never tried the $25 breakfast buffet, so I can't comment on its quality. Another couple of gripes, $9.95 for internet when the rest of the free world now provides complimentary internet, and the hotel-exclusive television service provider has the slowest channel change and channel guide I have experienced anywhere. I finally wrote a list of channels (No AMC? No Fox Sports1? No FX?) so I could change channels directly, though that was problematic as the remote and TV didn't communicate all that well.This hotel really doesn't do much to accommodate its members with status. I talked to a Platinum guy, who was stuck on the same floor with me. At least he had free internet.On the plus side, Waikiki is only about a ten-minute walk away. There are plenty of restaurants within the same distance. The pool area has nice comfy sofas, and is a great place for evening cocktails. The staff was quite willing to help and most were reasonably friendly. Oh yeah, the cookies are still damn fine. In summary, this property appears to be getting a face lift outside, but the surgeon needs to do some major work inside as well. Additionally, this DoubleTree needs to work on a lot of the little things to earn its leaves. I can't expect Hilton to move the hotel to a beachfront location, but it sure can make what they have better.",Kansas City,"KCTiger</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kansas City</strong>",20,3.0

Check-in was easy and while the valet-only parking was a surprise, it's not that big a deal since the garage is so tiny and maneuvering would have been a pain (plus, the valets are FAST). They were kind enough to give us a very large suite on the 17th floor, perhaps to make up for having no ocean-facing rooms, but honestly, the DoubleTree is so far away from the ocean, I'm not sure we would have had much of a view. Room was enormous and the bed very comfortable, and curtains helped block out the sunlight, though unfortunately, not the traffic noise. Double-paned windows and sliders might help cut down some of the ambient traffic because on Oahu, man does traffic start early. We enjoyed drinks in the bar and found both bartenders extremely friendly to us and the other visitors. Clearly the DoubleTree handles a lot of business travelers, because we saw many individuals eating by themselves or in groups. You save money on the DoubleTree by not paying for a lot of resort amenities, but the lap pool and small gym was clearly getting some use. If you're okay with being in full view of the next door apartment building, it should not be a problem, but I can see where this may not be the most desirable of hotels for families looking for extras.

And for another $70 per night you can stay there and have an ocean beach, a quiet room, and access to three swimming pools. One other note: the pool at the double tree is in the wind. It's little with no shelter. It is saltwater which is nice. We went over to the Hilton Hawaiian village and the wind went away. I think the big buildings block the wind at the Hilton.

As it is, I'm paying almost four bills a night (includes thirty/night for parking), so I'm grateful, but not overly, especially when my cancellation date passes and they start advertising my room at under two forty/night. Also, every other Hilton property gives me a full breakfast as a Diamond - here I got continental BF with the option to pay eight dollars for an upgrade to include protein (you can get a full breakfast at four restaurants within 100 yeards for under seven dollars).The location appears great on a map, but it is not as convenient to the beach as any other Hilton property for miles. Also, there is bothersome construction on the street in front of the hotel, a one-way street which adds time (Honolulu traffic is bad enough).The ""partial oceanviews"" are 80% blocked by much taller neighboring buildings - no sunset to be enjoyed from the lanai, only views of neighbors A/C units.OK, it is the holidays are families are to be extpected. But unsupervised kids in the gym and kids playing games on the PCs in the Business Center are not supposed to be allowed, but the hotel staff does not police this.The worst part is the so-called restaurant. Not sure why, but the large restaurant is closed and they atempted to use the bar which seats 48 at tables plus 8 at the counter to serve what I estimate to be 1000 guests in their 317 rooms. After Christmas Day, waits for a table ran up to half an hour even begining at 7:30 AM. I still have leftover coupons which I could not use because they stop serving at 10 AM (and this at a ""resort,"" during holidays).I tried to ask the Concirege to make a reservation for us at the Hilton Hawaiian Village luau but I gave up after waiting 30 minutes for her to finish with the couple ahead of me. (I did call the HHV direcltly, got VM, left a message asking for a call back and never heard from them).The final nail in their coffin came when I asked one person at the front desk if I could trade in some miles for the balance of my stay. She said Yes but I had to go through HIlton reservations, which I did. They confirmed availability for some of my nights but when I got to the desk, they informed me they would have to charge me a hundred dollar penalty - less than the nearly four bills/night I am paying but it became a matter of principal - some way to treat your best customers!We checked out options and plan to stay at the Hilton Waikiki next time and hope for better treatment and ""value.""","Ft Worth, TX","securetraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ft Worth, TX</strong>",15,2.0

With many stays all over the world - this was my least favorable. The hotel needs to start off with a management presence and a staff that is happy to be there.

There really is nowhere in the hotel other than a few chairs in the lobby to hang and chat. Balconies are what they are with cheap furniture and it's very noisy outside.

The walk into the main part of Waikiki gets old fast. You might lose weight staying at this hotel, but you will gain blisters. Wear good shoes. You will be walking a lot if you plan to visit the best shopping areas and restaurants in Waikiki. It's not easy or convenient to drive a car in Waikiki, though it's nice to have a car for some of the excursions to distant sight-seeing locations. The location of this hotel feels a little industrial, though it is not industrial. It is a hotel surrounded by other hotels. There is a park of some type opposite the front entrance, but it is under construction. Your view from most windows will be another hotel or construction. Ours was the rooftop parking for the hotel next door. The valet were quick and friendly, no complaints there and it is the only parking available. There is no public parking at this hotel. I believe the charges were another $30 per day for valet and add your tipping to that. There is no gift shop -- disappointing. Just a thing that I think many people, particularly women, love to visit at the hotels, particularly for last minute items they have forgotten or for late-night snacks. They had a rather useless vending machine on the main lobby floor. They should absolutely incorporate a small gift shop into this hotel. The beach is not in your backyard, nor is it across the street. You're going to walk about 10 minutes to and from the beach. There are far fewer restaurants and shopping areas near this hotel than other hotels you will find further southeast. There is an ABC store fairly close.Not too far from the hotel you will find one restaurant I can recommend. It's the Wailana Coffee House/Cocktail Lounge. This restaurant has the feel of a ""mom and pop"" restaurant, not a lounge vibe at all. It has excellent service, the food is good and the prices are reasonable. Avoid at all costs the in-room Round Table pizza delivery! The hotel advertises for this restaurant delivery. To make a long story short, we ordered our pizza at 6:31 p.m. At 8:12 p.m. I called to see if they had run into a problem. The guy at Round Table told me, ""Well, it's only been 45 minutes since you ordered."" Yet my phone shows me exactly when I called, so I'm laughing at his effort to fool me. He goes on to tell me that we are the next drop off. 15 minutes later he still isn't there, so I called back at 8:30 and I'm told he's coming. He arrived at 8:45 with a stone cold pizza and a nervous look on his face and apologizing all over the place. I should have just cancelled the order but I had already paid for it. They had my money. Worst pizza delivery ever -- stone cold pizza and no microwave in the room! Do not order it!So back to the hotel rooms: Unfortunately the layout of the room makes it difficult for them to position a large TV so that it faces both beds well. There isn't much they can do about this because there isn't a wall space, due to the sliding door between the living room and bedroom. You'll probably be too tired to watch television anyway because the walking is going to make you fall asleep early every night. The bathroom doors are annoying as they are heavy sliding doors. The sliding door provides less privacy as well. The bottom of the door is not on a slider so the bottom would swing out from the door frame itself and bang back onto the frame unless you were sliding it very, very slowly. Not good if you're trying to be quiet. The satellite/cable TV at this facility was not very good. It lost the signal several times while we were there. They don't provide many channels, but movie choices were plentiful. You have a small refrigerator and bar area with a sink just inside the front door. With wind, you can hear whistling off and on coming through the sliding doors to the deck, one in the bedroom, one in the living room. I used a sound machine when sleeping so it blended in and I was able to ignore it. There is a living room with another television and sliding doors, which is nice if someone wants to take a quiet nap in the bedroom. The hotel is very quiet. I could hear guests as they passed our room, but overall it was not a problem. We heard very little noise. The ice machine on our floor was broken the entire time, which was fine with me because our room was next to the machine. The bathroom is decently sized, with average décor. The trash cans in the bathroom annoyed me because they are divided, one side for recycle, one for non-recycle. The problem is the two slots are so small you can barely put anything in them before they are full. Overflowing in no time and we only had two of us in the room. Seems petty but I pay attention to details. There are two vanities, one inside and one outside the restroom. You have two closets, so plenty of closet space. There is a very small deck which, despite the view, was nice to sit on.We did stop by and take a look at the continental breakfast the hotel provided. To get the upgraded continental breakfast, you had to pay more, which was just silly to me. It seems smarter to provide all of your guests with an amazing continental breakfast and up the price of all your rooms just slightly rather than insult them with your ""free"" continental breakfast which was next to nothing. This is the worst ""free"" continental breakfast I have seen in a hotel. Overall, I'm in the middle with this hotel. I see this as a great hotel for people who want to visit Waikiki but are on a tight budget. I would recommend it to people who love walking. I wasn't fully disappointed with the walking for the simple fact that I knew I was burning off some of the meals I ate. I would return to this hotel if I were on a budget, but it is definitely not my first choice. I'd try everything I could to move closer to the action before I'd go back to this hotel. But it provided enough pros that I would recommend it to those on a tight budget who also want a clean hotel with friendly staff. The beds were comfortable as well.",Utah,"Keesym</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Utah</strong>",196,3.0

I am from the island of Kauai and have stayed at your hotel many times in the past. Your staff is always fantastic however this time the care and concern for my situation was incredible. My husband was rushed via a medical plane from Kauai to Oahu and spent 14 days in Straub Hospital. I was frantic to find a hotel room for myself. I called the Doubletree Hotel in tears and I was so happy to hear a friendly voice on the other end of the phone. I told Danny Castillo my situation and he told me not to worry he would take care of it for me and call me back with a confirmation number. I knew there was a large convention in town and I knew it would be difficult to find me a room. In less than one hour Danny called me back and told me he had a room for me.  Now ten days later, my husband had completed his Heparin blood thinners and the Doctors were discharging him but wanted us to stay on Oahu for 5-7 days before we could fly home to Kauai. Again, Danny helped us find the perfect accessible room to allow my husband to recover from such a horrific ordeal. The staff greeted us with a wheelchair and helped me get my husband to our room. Housekeeping has been so accommodating with all my request. We are currently staying in the hotel and don’t know how much longer we will be here.

It has the typical dark wood and modern décor of Doubletree hotels, with touch of Hawaiiana. I'm also a fan of the citrus bath amenities. Love the sleek lobby design. Hallways are a little behind-- a tad stuffy and drab. The front desk is friendly, but some of the staff are more reserved than others. Ask for extra cookies anytime and they will provide without hesitation. Parking is typical of Waikiki: expensive (30.00) and valet only. The bell/valet downstairs were always cheerful with good energy. It makes the price hurt a lot less. In the evening they weren't always present so had to wait around a bit. Not big a deal.Doubletree dining: breakfast and restaurant/room service, across the board seems to be a bit more expensive than other hotels of similar value (if they have dining at all). Because of that I usually prefer to pay a little more and book Embassy Suites and get a bigger room, free breakfast and nightly reception. In the end the price ends up about the same.This is one of the few hotels that offer a resort credit for declining housekeeping service for three (I think) consecutive cleanings. I wish this was something more places offered. Its a great way to help guests save $$ and hotel to save on cleaning costs as well. Most importantly its good for the environment right? Mahalo to the hotel for offering this.Everyone seems to take issue with the view. Myself included, though it doesn't enrage me like others. I've stayed twice in ""City or Mountain View"" category. You might get a high floor city/mountain view, OR a low floor looking over a seedy backstreet. Keep in mind the nicer view is noisier with street and traffic noise. I'm curious what keeps them from re-labeling the room types. The unit itself is great either way, but if you need any sort of view, the extra 20 a night is worth a ""partial ocean"" guarantee (to not look into the alley). Otherwise. This might not be the place for you. When travelling to Hawaii keep in mind that there are thee different ""ocean-something"" room types: partial ocean view, ocean view, ocean front. The latter is outrageous, and about $700-1400 a night, or more, depending on the hotel and season. For the price, the Alana is among the best for actual room accommodations. Many other places in the same range have extremely outdated interiors, basic (or worse: tacky) furnishings, and sometimes musty/antique smelling rooms. I'm partial to the clean crispy feel, dark woods and cool sleek design. I'm also a fan of the upper-tier Aqua hotels or Outrigger hotels. They will be more expensive though. Hard to beat the Doubletree value.Location is good, as long as you're aware that its a mile to central Waikiki, and a mile to Ala Moana shopping center. A leisurely 20 minute stroll in either direction. Its also one of the nearest to Hawaii Convention Center, less than 10 minutes away. If you're here for conference I'd pick this place over the Ala Moana Hotel any day.Lots of good dining in the immediate area. The concierge can reserve tables and book tours or transportation. The closest beach is at the Hilton Hawaiian Village about 5 minutes away. Nice, but crowded. Fort Derussy park across the street is big and beautiful. I'd rather sun myself and relax there, to be honest. Good for morning walks and always quiet. Couldn't speak for the pool or internet access. You're in Hawaii, so unless on business just ditch both and have fun!","Honolulu, Hawaii","DisgracedPuppy7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",26,4.0

If you are expecting the normal Hilton brand experience you will be disappointed. No free breakfast, no free wifi in room, no free parking.

The elevators and hall ways are hot and non-air conditioned, but the elevators are fast. Everyone is friendly, which helps. If the normal Hilton brand items as mentioned above were free it would be 5-star. However, no matter what good deal you get, you can expect to pay at least an additional $40-50 a night for the stuff that is normally complimentary. With all that being said I would probably rate it 3-star, but the food in the Trees restaurant and Earl (the bartender) specifically bumps it to a 4-star. I can't emphasis enough how much Earl does for this place. An attentive bartender that doesn't leave your glass empty, but isn't pushy at the same time. Earl is enough to make you want to stay at this place even if you expect the amenities that other Hilton brand place give you. Ownership should give him a pat on the back.

I read the many reviews on the Marriott and Hilton hotels by many other ""trip advisors"" and went out on a limb and dreaded the outcome.

I must say, it was an excellent choice. The hotel was very nice, clean and in a great location. The beach was very close. The hotel says one block, but you have to go through the Hawaiian Hilton and I count that as a block, but it is a very easy walk. The Waikiki beach is beautiful and believe it or not, it was not very crowded. Back to the hotel. We had a ocean view room and it was very nice. You can see the beach but are far enough away from the beach do not spring for the ocean front. Customer service was very good. You get a free continental breakfast every day, or you can upgrade to a hot cooked breakfast for $7.00. We did that a couple of days. Hopefully you can get Michael as the chef. He made the best omelette I have ever eaten. My only complaints about the hotel was that we did not have a microwave in our room and that you have no option for parking except for valet. I expected to pay for parking, but I hate having to wait to get my car. It just seems easier for me to park my own car and get it whenever I am ready to leave. Other than these two things it was an excellent hotel. Lots of great restaurants and shopping within walking distance.

It’s not in the same class as the big resorts nearby, but it could be a good alternative depending on what you are looking for. I stayed here recently for two nights while in town on business. The hotel is on busy Ala Moana on the western edge of Waikiki. You will have to walk a few blocks to the beaches or most of the shopping and restaurants. There are a few restaurants close by, notably Cheeseburger Waikiki (see my separate review), Todai and Tony Roma’s. The hotel lobby area is up a short escalator (or one story up on the elevator) from the driveway. The lobby area is small. Parking is by valet only ($30 per day at this writing). I got free wireless internet access but this may not be available to everyone. The hotel met the basics for me: although my room was rather small, it was clean, quiet, had a comfortable bed, and the temperature control actually worked. My room also had a balcony and a small fridge (no microwave). The in-room safe stopped working after the first day, a minor inconvenience. There is no complimentary breakfast. I had breakfast at the on-site ‘Trees’ restaurant and it was fine. On a weekday morning during tourist season I had to wait for a table. I did not have the breakfast buffet, but it looked very good with an on-duty chef making omelets and waffles. The breakfast buffet was $23 which by Waikiki standards is cheap.

It was a nice location and walking distance to the beach, which I sadly didn't have time to visit on this trip. Decor, beds, and small things were great.The downside to this place, most Doubletrees charge for breakfast unless you're a gold or diamond member. Not a huge deal. But since my stay was rather short, I never had time to veg out and surf the web. Seemingly this place must live under high pressed order. Most Doubletrees have wifi included it seems or staff are generous to give access. Not so much here. In this day and age, wifi might be a deal breaker for some...ie my Wife.

Housekeeping was adequate but not great. The rooms are nicely appointed and comfortable, but lots of compromises apart from that. Like all Doubletrees, everything but the room itself is a la carte: pay for in room wifi ($10/day), snacks and drinks for purchase in lobby, very small business center (two PC terminals, I think), breakfast for purchase, parking is average price for Waikiki (which is expensive though), pay for early check in or late check out. The weirdest thing was that the lobby and restaurant/bar, gym and other common areas, as well as the rooms are all air conditioned, but for some inexplicable reason the halls between rooms are not climate controlled. That leads to the halls getting damp and musty (very typical in Oahu) that the cleaning staff then tries to cover with some pretty powerful air fresheners. This and the pay to play for everything, on top of the crowded and inadequate common areas really make this a hard sell, even though their prices are competitive and their general staff attitude positive.It is across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village (shops, restaurants and bar, beach access) and at the end of the Waikiki strip closest to the airport (~30 mins away in moderate traffic). The up-side is that there are several small restaurants, ABC stores, convenience stores, and gift shops right on the same block and not nearly as jammed as the ones on the strip in the evenings. The highlight might well be Wailana Coffee House, which is an absolute gem for people that want good, filling food for reasonable prices (average per plate meal ~$13 - which is a steal for Waikiki).","Maryland, United States","CDW70</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maryland, United States</strong>",5,3.0

We arrived to room not ready. When we got in there filthy. Long black hair in bath, stains on everything, lounge looked like a dog lived on it. Curtains hanging off track, blocked sinks x 2 and stained and dirty, urine behind toilet, dirty dirty grout, nasty smell from drains. Our hallway from lift was not vacuumed in the 5 days we were there. I brought all of these issues to the attention of the front desk on two occasions and nothing was ever done, until I commented again on check out and they offered to comp the parking. Would of been nicer if they had cleaned. I didn't ask for any discount. I was just replying to the 'How was your stay question'. Staff seemed overworked and not happy, except for the valet parking guys. Horrible view of down rent flats next door and filthy balconies below and our own was very dirty and dusty.. Rooms have no overhead lighting and so are dark and the ceiling height is very low. Marks on walls and mirrors and even spills we made were never cleaned up off surfaces. One day housekeeping didn't make the beds up, just changed the towels. If you get a budget room rate it is ok for Waikiki where a lot of hotels are old, but if can't stand dirty, don't go. It is not two rooms, just a sliding panel between bedroom and lounge not a wall and there is only one TV which is in lounge with terrible channel offerings, though I didn't really try to find anything much. The sofa bed did have a foam tempur mattress which was comfy, however the fabric on arms of lounge was so dusty and stained it wasn't nice to lay your head on. The beds were small doubles. Easy walk 15 mins to Ala Moana Mall, bus stop is halfway there so you may as well walk. Return bus drops at 8 mins away at Hilton side entrance. Can get to the beach by going across the road and through the Hilton Resort 10 minutes. They let us have towels there, but didn't know of any reciprocal agreement, so maybe check that out. Laundromats nearby and enough restaurants and ABC stores convenient to buy sundries and meals. No smoking anywhere including balconies so all the guests hang on the front wall of the footpath to smoke which is not a good look.",,597joannek,1,1.0

As a family of three two double beds just don't cut it anymore and that's what the vast majority of hotels offer if you want two beds. The location (two blocks from the beach) and beds were fine. The hotel staff was also friendly.The rest was disappointing. We were upgraded to a suite because I'm a Hilton Diamond member. The upgrade added a separate sitting area in our room which was nice to have. However the room is dated and much of it is of poor quality or disrepair. Large paint scratches or discolored repairs (i'm talking 3-4 inches) were on several walls and one door. The bathroom door is a slider and there's was a 1.5 inch gap between the bottom and the floor.The balcony overlooked the tiny pool and the parking lot and building next door. Our room was right next to the elevator and you can definitely hear it during the night. If you have trouble falling asleep this isn't the room for you.The breakfast was adequate and most people including us seemed to have a coupon. I'm not sure what it is about business hotel restaurants but they seem to some of the most inefficient eating establishments on the planet. The wait to be seated, get your check, a glass of water or something as simple as skim milk was ridiculous. What makes it all the more painful is that it's a buffet so it's not like they were busy taking orders. I can't believe how often 2-3 employees were just walking around but not doing anything in particular. Into the kitchen with empty hands and out of the kitchen with a single item. This was a real issue for us by the end of the stay.Overall the place isn't terrible but I seriously doubt we'll be back unless the rates are dirt cheap.

My family of four decided to stay there & give it a whirl due to the Hilton being completely booked. Their attitude set the standard and is what I think all customer service should be like. It all started at the valet with a friendly greeting and off to the front desk with several freshly hot baked chocolate chip cookies which were complimentary from the front desk customer service representative, Melissa who greeted us with a very sweet smile & a super great attitude & excellent customer service skills. Check in was quick and easy. The price alone was more then fair considering how clean everything was in the room. Well from an alright day turned into an awesome night because not only was everything to our satisfaction but we even got comped to the penthouse at no extra charge so it was a totally free upgrade which we gladly took. As we checked out in the morning we completely forgot all of our personal items that we left in the restroom of our room & called the hotel who transferred me to their hotel security Mark, who said he was going to be leaving soon but would kindly pass the message to the next security who was going to be coming on duty and let me know his name was Michael. Mark then said don't worry about it I'm sure Michael will get the message and have no problem holding your items for you & he will have it ready by the time you get back to the hotel. As soon as the next Security Michael clocked in he gave me a courtesy call right away & said to just let him know when we get there & he will gladly bring our items down. As several hours passed by and as we made our way back to the hotel and parked in the loading zone while I quickly got out I asked the front desk for my belongings that I left behind and the security Michael had my belongings right there waiting for me :) He was very awesome and even checked the drawers in the room for us and found a brand new shirt my kids bought for there Dad for father's day & kindly returned it to us. I tried to offer him a tip twice and as he kindly refused and said im just doing my job and after forcing it upon him a couple of times i realized that he was so sweet and generous that when he finally took the money he dropped it right back in my bag when I wasn't looking. So I felt he needed to be acknowledged for that kind gesture. So my family and I would like to just say a huge Mahalo to the staff mentioned above for making our stay the best one we've ever had at any hotel. Also this was our first time staying here & will definitely NOT be our last!!! Thanks again for a very wonderful as well as comfortable and welcoming stay. P.S.

I will caution you that if you expect your Hawai'i stay to include a view of the beach, then you should choose a different hotel. Since I only tend to be in the room after dark, a beach view is not that important to me. The rooms were spacious and economical. I rented a suite for what less than I would have paid for a standard room at other nearby hotels. The hotel staff was professional and courteous, and went out of their way to provide a high level of service. The in-house restaurant provided an awesome breakfast buffet and a good dinner, both at reasonable prices. While the pool and fitness center were a bit small, they were clean and well-maintained.

There were sliding glass doors to a balcony from both the bedroom and living room. Unfortunately even on this high floor there was excessive street noise( sirens blaring, horns honking, car alarms going off and very loud motorcycles) that could be heard throughout the night. It may be that the other side of the hotel's rooms were quieter, but the mountain view side was incredibly noisy, and would certainly be a problem for light sleepers. The staff in this DoubleTree was excellent with the exception of the very apathetic server of our first day's breakfast. She sat us at a dirty table, never asked what we wanted to drink ( I had to get up and ask for coffee and tea), never cleared a single plate during the breakfast buffet, and in general was dedicated to filling sweetener and sugar bowls for a later meal, chatting with other staff and not attending to her tables. The second day's breakfast service was much improved by Hila's cheerful attention to her customers. As Hilton Diamond members we received complimentary breakfast coupons, but unlike every other Hilton property we have ever stayed in, this DoubleTree restricted the coupon's value to a limited item continental buffet. There was an additional $7 charge for access to the full breakfast.The location of this hotel is excellent, about three or four blocks from the ocean and two blocks from the bus stop for bus routes 42 and 20 that go to Pearl Harbor Park. Bus fare is $2.50 per adult and $1 for seniors. The trip takes about an hour. Getting from the airport to the DoubleTree Alana is also very easy by using Speedi Shuttle.

The DoubleTree is the first hotel to be dropped off by Speedi Shuttle and is the last hotel to be picked up for the return to the airport.

Tonight sitting in the lobby, again, I can hear this woman being extremely loud and rude to another Asian customer, almost to the point of shouting. I highly doubt that any of them are going to to go and write a review, but I cannot stand it and dexided to write.As far as the accommodation is concerned, it is at best mediocre, the approach to my room with the open window screens reminded me of a student hostel I would have boarded in years ago. My single King room was spacious enough but cleanliness was obviously not their strong suit. Lovely shower but crud in and around the soap shelf. Glass tumblers had nastiness inside them, and I had to show them to the cleaning lady. I also had to personally ask her to smell the stale towels they kept leaving for me that simply stank, especially when wet. The Internet service was not good and while I could catch their complimentary lobby signal, there was barely any in the room. So I had to use the wired service. They charge for their Internet, so ne aware. There is also a $30 per day parking charge but thay is pretty much standard here in Waikiki hotels. The staff is extremely nice and helpful and the location walking distance from everywhere you want to be on Waikiki. It is the rudeness of Jessica Heath and the general drab decour and cleanliness issues that warrant the not so great rating from me. If someone from upper management had seen or heard her shouting just five minutes ago, she'd be sure ro be standing in the unemployment line tomorow. PS. I do not know this woman personally and I do not have any enmity towards her. This is just my very objective opinion based on my observations.",,Musafir2,1,4.0

I booked my room through Hilton reservations. Although I specifically asked for Waikiki, I was booked on a different island. Immediately after booking five rooms for our work staff we thought of an accommodation issue and learned of the mistake. The other Hilton transferred us to the Double Tree Alana where I would encounter the first of many exceptional people. I spoke to Elsa who right away saw the issue and set out to solve this issue. Despite having many things to check every so often she came back on the phone and told me she was still working on the reservation and apologized profusely for it taking so long. When all was said and done she had fixed our rooms and clarified the issues. Later the hotel General Manager called and wanted to make sure the problem was resolved. I was able to tell him yes in complete confidence. Finally when it came time for us to check in I got to meet Elsa who remembered the reservation and greeted me warmly and sincerely. It was at that time I learned of the issues that she had to overcome in securing our rooms. Unbeknownst to us the NFL pro-bowl was in town and she had kept an eye on our rooms so that there were no issues with our reservations. Our rooms were comfortable and accommodating. During the week that followed I saw Elsa and Rebecca many times and they always had a smile on their faces and no matter what they were doing they always greeted me by name and offered me a fresh warm Double Tree cookie. As a side note I want to thank Josie G. for taking the extra steps in keeping my room clean and her super pleasant demeanor to make sure she was not bothering me. The folks there at the Double Tree, every person at the desk and that I came across made sure to spread Aloha at every chance they had.

The rooms are decent and the beds are plenty comfortable. Parking in all of Honolulu is horrid so if you have a rental car be prepared to pay for valet which I think is $30 a day. The breakfast is just ok. The continental breakfast is your basic fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, pastry, etc.. If you want eggs you will need to pay for the buffet breakfast. It is very tasty but for the limited options and the high price I wouldn't pay for it everyday. The bar/lounge opens at 5pm and the dinner food is some of the best food in the area. I recommend eating at least one night there, besides, the bar staff at night is fantastic. The combo of Earl, Wilfred and Natalia always make sure you are taken care of.

(Bear in mind the stretch of Kalakaua Ave is pretty long, so if the store you want happens to be located at the other end of Kalakaua, then it won't take just 10-15mins. But, you get the idea.)If you prefer not to walk to the main shopping street, there are several tourist trolleys/buses that ply the Ala Moana - Kalakaua route. But these are chargeable. If you walk towards the Hilton Hawaiian village (7-12mins stroll away, going the opposite direction, away from Kalakaua), I believe there is a free shuttle bus service from there that takes you to the DFS Galleria. And that's located smack in the centre of the shopping area - Kalakaua. (This free shuttle makes a loop, that's why you have to walk away from Kalakaua, even though that might be your destination.) Otherwise, most trolley buses charge a free of $2, one-way.The receptionists should have a clearer idea of which buses to take and from where, depending on where you want to go.There is no Concierge services here, so the Receptionists double up as your Concierges.Waikiki beach is again a simple 10-15 stroll away.The hotel itself is pretty modern and updated. Bell services is located on the ground level, facing a sort of military space (I think it's called Fort Derussy.)The main reception is located on level 2. At check-in, I was pleasantly surprised to find the Director of Front Office himself doing the check-ins, along with his subordinates. I used to work in the hotel industry and to have someone from top management doing the actual work alongside the rank and file isn't something that happens often.3 of us stayed in a junior suite and found the room to be of a comfortable size. There was enough space for us to put 2 big suitcases and 3 cabin bags.Bathroom was again, of a nice size.No problems with noise even though our room faced the main street.As far as I know, wifi is chargeable but there is a business centre next to Reception, for use should you need to log onto the internet for a quick booking or checking-in for flights.Staff were all very friendly and in particular, Al from Bell Desk deserves to be mentioned. He was very knowledgeable regarding what buses to take and from where, and even advised me not to go to a particular museum as I might not have enough time to enjoy the museum properly. He then proceeded to suggest what to do with the remainder of my 5 hours of free time.I didn't use the gym or the pool facilities as we were out at the museums or hitting the shops most days. Overall, a really good stay here. Will MOST definitely be back.","Singapore, Singapore","Serene L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",14,4.0

The bathroom needed a bit more lighting but was large enough. We also had a balcony but weren't in the room long enough to use it. My only issue was the service at breakfast. There were often large lines of people waiting for a seat and the staff weren't very attentive. I also think extra tables could be fit into the room at the far end to accommodate more diners. If you are hungry, it's worth paying the extra $7 for the full breakfast where the chef cooks you omelettes how you like them.

I know it's a minor detail in an otherwise acceptable stay, but it really got under my skin. Maybe it's because I was on vacation and trying to relax. Maybe it's because it puts you in an awkward position when you only brought a couple bucks for a tip and now have to go get more money from your room. Maybe it's because this is the first time I have ever seen this (I stay over 100 nights per year with Hilton alone).

We arrived a couple hours early and they allowed us to check-in as a room was ready - however the suite that was assigned was not with the views we paid for. Upon alerting the front desk - they immediately changed our room with a beautiful view. A bonus was that it was near the elevators - a great convenience to my 89 year old grandmother. The beds were super comfortable and the bathrooms were clean. I wanted to also review the PH suite I stayed in the night prior to the wedding. I needed a large enough space for all my bridesmaids to get ready in as well as the hair stylist, photographer and videographer, make-up artist, parents etc. Understandable that real estate in Hawaii is expensive therefore the suite wasn't exceptionally large when comparing it to suite in other locations however it turned out to be perfect for what we needed. Not to mention the VIEW! We received one of the two suites with the balcony and boy, the view was amazing. We ended up taking all of our initial wedding pictures there with that beautiful backdrop of the ocean/sky! There was enough space for everyone walk through and hangout comfortably. Everyone was so great in coordinating our stay - Echo Gu, Director of Catering/Event Services, was so patient & helpful in assisting with setting up our room block. Leimomi Kamiya-Nada, Event Services Manager, was beyond awesome & accommodating in helping sort out any issues during our stay (including booking another room last minute) and helped to ease my stress as a destination bridezilla. I would definitely stay here again - in addition to it's prime location to Ala Moana mall, the shops on Kalakaua and my fave coffee shop, Wailana - it's the overall experience from the valet service to housekeeping and everything in between that really helps me to relax and enjoy my time there.","Torrance, California","sc831</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Torrance, California</strong>",20,5.0

I basically did not sleep on this trip. I was told to state when I got bottle waters etc. I did every time but at the end I was threated with complete disrespect indicating it was my fault for not stating it.

I can only think that if I had taken the time in my many years of work travel to create a Hilton Honors reward acct this wouldn't have happened with the staff able to see how often I stay at a Hilton owned hotel but no way to tell. I found myself in Hawaii for work last week and had previously planned to stay on one of the military bases but when I went to check in I was told there was a mistake with my reservation and I was ""bumped"". I was on military travel and the Army sets our allotted Per Diem rate at a specific dollar amount so if I choose to stay ""off-base"" I'm on the hook for the difference. I brought my son and mother along so figured it well worth the extra cost to stay near the beach versus on base so I looked up the Double Tree and was pleasantly surprised that they had plenty of rooms available (Sunday-Thursday). The hotel itself was beautiful however my 2 bed suite was located literally next door to the elevator. The Honolulu Double Tree is quite large and the elevator ran non-stop, not 5 minutes went by the entire 5 days I was there without the sound of the elevator cables, bells etc! I asked to me moved to another room but was told that was the only room ""My government discount would allow for"". Now I have deployed numerous times so can deal with less than favorable conditions but I was paying darn near the exact same rate as anyone off the street so quite thrown when that was their response. The DT's fix was to give me a single day voucher for the continental breakfast with the stipulation that I could only eat the fruit/cereal bar and not ""aloud"" to partake in the meat/omelet portion of the buffet! With the amount of times I have stayed with a Hilton owned hotel this was very disheartening to say the least. I can guarantee the Hilton group I will not only reconsider staying with any of their hotels during my future work travels (minimum of 10-20 trips a year) but inform any and all soldiers (200+) that work for/with me of my experience and Hilton's opinions of what type of room my ""Military Discount"" makes me deserving of.","Kirkland, WA","lbc007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kirkland, WA</strong>",2,2.0

Nope the WIFI was an extra $10 and then it would not work, weak and sporadic signal. And the continental breakfast is insulting, $16 for yogurt and cold cereal and another $9 for a pot of coffee. Biggest rip off in Hawaii. AC was loud, and I had to leave it off to sleep in the heat. Couldn't leave a window open because of the street noise. The bathrooms are small and no counter space whatsoever in the room I had. And the hotel staff smiled and payed lip service, but not helpful at all (exception was the bellhop).

The very satisfactory continental breakfast (cereal, plenty of fresh fruit. fresh pastries, yogurt and juice) was $16; the hot add-ons (eggs to order, waffles, etc.) took it to $22. There was a restaurant next door (Cheeseburgers) that offered a $6 breakfast, but we did not try it. The suite option worked great for us. You can separate the suite from the main bedroom by closing a sliding door. It's a smallish room containing a loveseat sized couch with a fold out bed, a desk, and a flat screen TV. It gave our teen and us a bit of space from each other. It would also give a business person a bit of extra elbow room. The only downside was the suite was next to the elevators so you could hear them move up and down (noticed it mostly during the busy times of the day). The receptionist said all the suites are next to the elevators - not sure if that is true or not. I watched the Hilton website to get the best deal I could.

Location: Great location but not directly on the beach. A short walk will get you to many excellent beaches, but if you MUST have a room overlooking a beach or water, this is NOT your hotel. Otherwise, very centrally located with plenty to do nearby and an easy stroll to all the best that Waikiki has to offer. (side note: this review is about the hotel, not really about Waikiki but I will say that if you want a non-touristy location on Oahu, you should probably avoid Waikiki)Staff: The staff is extremely nice and very accommodating. You really couldn't ask for a nicer bunch of people. 5 stars to the staff--desk clerks, maintenance, bar, management and housekeeping. They really do a great job. They are a credit to the Hilton chain.Rooms: The rooms are nice and about average size. Nice bathroom, always clean. No complaints whatsoever.Amenities: We never used the pool but we did use the gym. Again, no complaints.Restaurant: We did make it to the bar a few times and had appetizers that were good. The bartenders were all nice and helpful.Considering the price differential between the big beach hotels and the Doubletree, I'd say it was more than worth it to stay here. Again, if you MUST be on the beach, you'll need to look elsewhere as this hotel is a few blocks from the beach. But considering the Hilton will cost you easily twice as much per night then it would all be a matter of what you're willing to pay.If I have to go to Waikiki again, I'll probably stay here.","Atlanta, Georgia","Buttsman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",35,4.0

This is probably one of the few Hilton properties I wouldn't go back to, for two reasons. 1. The air conditioning didn't work consistently. The AC would somehow periodically reset itself to a higher temperature throughout my stay. i.e., I would go to bed with the temp at 68 and awake a few hours later with the room at 74. This meant I kept having to get up in the middle of the night and set the thermostat back to 68. I called the front desk to see if they could fix it. They sent a manager up who did an override to let my thermostat go down to 62; he said it would last for 3 days. During the second night at that setting, however, I woke up with the temperature back in the mid-high 70's and had to reset the temp back to 62. This was really disruptive to my sleep cycle. I travel Hilton for business, and the poor quality of sleep was a definite deal-breaker.2. The hotel restaurant was seriously understaffed. I ate a few breakfasts and dinners here. At one point in time the continental breakfast, which is mostly cereal and fruit, was out of bowls (they told me they were washing them but it would be a 10 minute wait). On another occasion they were out of cereal. The buffet always looked destroyed. The staff was running around trying to keep up, but with so few staff, they could only do so much. The same thing could be said for dinner. I waited over 20 minutes for my waiter to even notice I needed a check because that single waiter was working the whole dinning room.","Salem, Oregon","meghans458</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salem, Oregon</strong>",1,2.0

In my industry - healthcare, high levels of service are to be expected – no tips, no awards, no pat on the back. You and your family’s health and livelihood are vital to us. I travel to Honolulu quite often to work in one of our facilities there. I’m a very loyal Hilton member and will stay at a property up to sometimes 15 miles further, if I have to. If you’re in Honolulu, you don’t have to do that. Most people (including myself at times) will stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, which is a great property. It has everything a vacation traveler would want in a small village atmosphere. But few people know or realize that just 150 yard away is one of Hilton’s best kept secrets in a property – The Doubletree Alana. Whether you’re staying for business or pleasure, this place is great. It’s great first and foremost because of its service offering. Beginning with their welcome team, you’re made to feel very welcomed and secure. From there, the front desk, restaurant and even cleaning personnel are top notch. I’ve been to the island more than 70 times in the past 6 years and The Doubletree Alana is the perfect place for business traveler who require and deserve a higher level of responsiveness, follow through and attention to detail – Starting with getting the type of room you requested (I hate it when hotels screw that up, how simple). I can hit the same shops at the village, run the same running paths and even shop Waikiki faster than when staying at the village. Some don’t remember that Doubletree is now part of Hilton. Some want to stay in a place that reminds them of Disney. Others would like great surrounding with high-touch service and does what they promise they will. If that’s the case, the next time you’re in Honolulu, hit the Doubletree Alana. You won’t be sorry.

Hats off to this hotel and its staff. We never wanted for anything during our stay. This hotel was very clean and had comfortable beds. Everyone had friendly smiles and helped us with anything we needed. Our TV went out during our stay and within minutes, the maintenance crew was in our room installing a brand new tv. Traveling with women only, we felt very safe and secure at this hotel. It is in a great central location in walking distance to anything you may need. I would like to recognize three people that stood out to me and my daughters our entire stay. Theresa and Elsa from the front desk, always friendly smiles, gave us those great cookies every day and was just so kind to us our entire stay. And we definitely could not forget our GREAT bellman, BRETT FORSTER! I personally work in the hospitality business and know what great customer service should be and Brett Forster went over and beyond for me and my girls.... Told us about the best restaurants, shops and places to sightsee while we were in Hawaii. I think we made him laugh everyday with funny things we would do.... Like renting an electric car and was scared he might have to come get us if it didn't start.....Brett is a one of kind person and without him guiding us I don't think our stay would have been as enjoyable....He had a great personality and should be recongnized for his work and all he does at the Doubletree.

There were a few small quirks, but nothing that outweighed a wonderful stay at this location.PROS:- Big, comfortable beds. I had a very restful night's sleep each night. Thank you!- Very clean.- The shower was warm and inviting. I love the remodeled bathrooms!- Stunning views of both the mountains and the ocean (depending on the room you get to stay in).- I love that you can step outside of your room and enjoy the weather outdoors. Wonderful.- Friendly staff that communicated with me before my arrival. I was impressed by this.- I hate a late flight, and I was accommodated -- another impressive surprise.- The ability to get $10 credits per night for use during dinner in the restaurant downstairs if you decline housekeeping services each day. Nice.- Right across the street from the beach. You simply cross over the street and the beach is on the other side of the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It's a perfect location. Many of these reviews say that it is far away from the beach. This is simply not true. It's a safe five minute walk. I walked late at night all the time while I was here and never, ever felt unsafe. There are people everywhere at night, and they are almost all tourists.- The location is wonderful. It was in a perfect spot for me.- Bell and valet staff were super-friendly.CONS:- The charge for parking was ridiculous at $30 per night (when you figure in tip, you're looking at $32 per day for this valet-only feature of the hotel). My car rental, including taxes, was only $37 per night. When the parking is as much as your rental, you know there's a problem. Yes, I understand that many of the other properties in Waikiki charge around the same amount for parking, but just because you CAN charge for something doesn't mean you should.- As a previous reviewer noted, you will here sirens throughout the night. It didn't bother me in the slightest, but if sirens bother you, look elsewhere.- The free breakfast for HHonors Gold and Diamond members is pretty bad. Dry cereal, yogurt, and some bread/pastry items are pretty much all that are available. If you want a hot meal, you have to pay to ""upgrade"" to it. This seems pretty silly when there are two restaurants on either side of the hotel that you can pay less than the ""upgrade"" for and get a much bigger meal. They should rethink this breakfast strategy, especially for their Gold and Diamond members. Why? They aren't making much money off of it (even for the upgrade), and if so many reviews are speaking negatively of it, then it's not really worth continuing (just my thought). I had a free breakfast for four mornings because of my HHonors status, and I only took advantage of it twice.OVERALL IMPRESSION:This is a solid Doubletree location, and I had an outstanding time on Oahu. I will return to this hotel the next time I stay in Waikiki. Thank you to the staff for your consideration and your helpful attitude.","Mount Pleasant, Michigan","travelprofessor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mount Pleasant, Michigan</strong>",139,4.0

The Doubletree was much less expensive than the nearby Hilton Hawaiian Village, so I gave it a try.At check-in I was ""upgraded to a suite"" (room 720), given ""free internet access"" and 2 bottles of water as a Hilton elite Traveler. Interestingly, the was a a suite adapted for disabled customers (e.g., wheelchair accessible, walk in shower with grab bars and bench seating). I did not need or request such accommodations, but appreciated the suite upgrade with on exception. The closet hanger bars were available only at wheelchair height making having of linger garments a challenge.The staff were generally helpful and friendly, but in a laid-back Hawaiian fashion. For example, when I went to check out two of us different customers) waited for the only available clerk as she chatted of the phone for a good 2-3 minutes. In addition I could not get the WiFi internet link to work consistently. After two sets of complaints about that I learned (on the evening of my final day) that my room had poor WiFi reception because it was adjacent to the elevator shaft which somehow compromised the signal. They offered to move me to another room or give me a $10 dinner coupon, but it was 8 pm and I was scheduled to leave the next morning at 6 am. It would have helped more if they'd addressed this issue when i first raised it 48 hours earlier.The room was generally clean, but with a few non-roach insects. They did a planned fumigation on my second day.I was at business meetings all day x3, so I only really used the room to sleep and shower. The desk was nice, but not helpful without the internet access. The bed was comfortable, but the thermostat was in the living room of the suite and would not go below 68, keeping the bedroom at 72-74 most of the time (a bit too warm for my tastes).The maid service was okay but borderline inattentive on detail (e.g., did not refill empty tissue dispenser or empty water from ice bucket).It's a good enough alternative to the flagship Hilton across the street, but does have lestt than stellar attributes.","Boston, Massachusetts","Fontek</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",129,3.0

Firstly there is only valet parking at a $30+ a night. it's not cheap and there is no deal if you stay over 5 nights. They have electric cars to hire by the hour and if I'd have known I would have probably used them. WiFi is free in lobby but pay as you go everywhere else - unless your a ""gold / diamond"" frequent stayer. That's a rip off and this is not the case in other Double Trees. Couple of other small points - no complementary bottled water in room, soap not shower gel - which you notice when you have just stayed 6 nights in another Double Tree in California.

Even after a short shower I had the feeling, its steam bath. The second stay we had a double, as booked. It was refurbished and actually better, than the first suite. Staff was friendly and responsive. Complimentary breakfast was very limited, but that’s a standard in US. I liked the porridge with blueberries. Omelettes or full American breakfast are for additional 10 USD. Hotel offers in house parking – more on that later. This hotel performs on the scale of 10 for me as 4. I had two major problems. First was one of the two TV sets in the suite. Unfortunately the one in the main room did not really work. Usually I do not care much about TV, but we arrived on the night, when new Pope was elected and we were curious, who he is. I alerted the reception and a guy tried to fix it, with limited success. I asked twice more to fix it, and nothing happened. Funny enough, the second set in the other room worked fine – but it was in the other room. We arrived with a rented car. Efficient staff parked my car and it was prepared within seconds, when we need it. We were not informed about the price of this service, however on the coupon was written 3$. I found that cheap, but given the hotel price level somehow nice. The biggest trouble was the bill. First of all, we were charged for pay TV, which we can hardly use, given it did not really work. After me pointing it out, this point was removed. Second, parking fee of 30 $ + taxes appeared on the bill. Its ridiculously high, smaller car rental cost about that! I complained about lack of information about the price, reception offered me 15$ discount. However, when I presented mentioned coupon (issued by DT Hilton staff with handwritten 3 USD), parking fee disappeared totally. I just hope, it was a misunderstanding, not a unsuccessful attempt. We parked elsewhere during our second stay. You can agree on it in some of the restaurants nearby during your dinner there.","Prague, Czech Republic","AdalbertMonticelli</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Prague, Czech Republic</strong>",15,3.0

Biggest plus is the friendly, accommodating staff. Biggest minus is the $30 per day valet parking only. In the area behind the hotel, there is minimal street parking which is metered during the day and free in the evening, if you are so lucky to snag a space. Our 18th floor room with partial ocean view and overlooking Ft. DeRussy was directly across one wall of the adjacent hotel and gave a feeling of privacy. Air conditioning was comfortable and turned off when the balcony door is open to save energy; thermostat control was intuitive and easy to operate. Bathroom fan runs continuously and effectively dries steam, but while it isn't excessively loud, it may still not be okay for guests who need a totally quiet room when sleeping. Easy to charge our many devices (cell phones, Kindle, laptops, camera) as needed with multiple outlets. Bedding consisted of feather pillows and comforter; Because I have allergies, I asked for and promptly got a foam pillow. Room was clean but a little dusty (from the feather bedding, I presume). Especially like Hilton's practice of encasing the comforters in sheets to keep the bedding cleaner. Free continental breakfast buffet as a Gold HHonors perk was nice because it seems pricey to pay $16 for continental and $23 for complete breakfast (waffles, eggs, etc.) when there are more reasonable options within a short walking distance from the hotel. In fact, everything needed was within walking distance - Hawaii Convention Center, the beach, drugstore, 7-11, ABC stores, other shops and restaurants - and it's a fairly easy walk to Ala Moana.",Northern California,"vanishingirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northern California</strong>",0,4.0

My major complaint was the cost of parking a car....$30 per day, NO self park, valet only. We ate breakfast only in the hotel restaurant; buffet or menu. Food was good and reasonably priced with a Hilton Honors coupon, otherwise breakfast was $23.00 per. Continental breakfast is free with a Hilton coupon. Immediately next door is a Cheeseburgers Waikiki that serves a basic breakfast for $5.99. 1 block west is a coffee shop that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. We did not utilize this location, so I cannot comment on the quality. Hotel is close to Hilton Hawaiian Village (5 minute walk), Ala Moana Mall (5 minute drive) and easy walking access to Ft De Russey all of the ""attractions"" on Kalakaua Blvd. We did not use any spa facilities, so I cannot comment.

The location is also good, it's right at the ""beginning"" of the Waikiki strip -- across the street from Fort DeRussy. The hotel also has very nice workout facilities. However, keep in mind that I stayed here as a Hawaii resident, and not as a tourist. You do have to pay for parking (I believe it's $15/ night) and the hotel does not have a hot tub (?!), but does have a heated pool. It's also not right next to the beach and the view is mostly of the strip / roads (and not the beautiful Pacific ocean) -- but you're only a short walk away from the beach. Also, there is no full-length mirror in the room (clearly, they were not thinking about females) -- but there are full length mirrors throughout the hotel. My friends also ate at the restaurant (I did not) and they said the service was not very good, and the food was alright (I had some cold leftovers). Overall, some definite pluses but also some definite minuses. However, I've definitely stayed in worse hotels in Waikiki (with better locations) -- so it's kind of up to you on what you're looking for.

The Doubletree staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and the guys at the bell stand are, as well.

We did experience a lot of city noise, but I think that is common for Waikiki. The rooms were adequate size and clean. I would prefer more bathroom counter space, but not really a problem. Enjoyed sitting on the balcony off of our room. There was a small fridge, but most importantly, lots of shelves for storage. We walked to the WalMart and stocked up on snacks and drinks. In the end, the ABC stores (which are everywhere) had decent prices. The staff was wonderful! We spent the most time talking with and receiving help from the bell staff. Eddie, Edward, and Jeff were great! Housekeepers were very friendly and did a nice job each day. My favorite interaction was with our housekeeper who came to clean our room while we were still there.

It's an average hotel, pretty much like other Doubletrees. Need to tighten up some maintenance and housekeeping standards. We asked for a room with two queen beds, and as Hilton Gold hoped for an upgrade. We got a ""suite-like"" room with two double beds and a sofa-bed, and sliding panels that separated the bedroom from the living area (not a door, hence not sound- or light-proof). Oddly, when checking in, we were assured there were two queen-size beds in the room. Fortunately the sofa-bed was a queen, so there was room for two parents and two teenagers. No upgrade, right next to the elevator, and a very low floor. The bathroom had a frosted glass door to the bedroom, meaning the light disturbed anyone trying to sleep.No bedding for the sofa-bed, but it did arrive within minutes of request. Similarly with minor maintenance issues - burned out light bulb, stopped-up toilet - quickly resolved. The room was spacious and fairly clean, but the sliding glass door to the balcony was covered with greasy fingerprints and never cleaned during our stay. The TV remote battery was dead. The second day we noticed some trouble with the door lock upon return from breakfast - the light would turn green, indicating the key worked (in other words, it had not been deprogrammed due to proximity to a cell phone), but the door wouldn't open. But after two or three ties, it worked so we forgot about it. Went out for the day, to return around 6 pm and find no housekeeping! Told the desk, who called back five minutes later and said, ""The deadbolt was locked."" Excuse me? What part of ""We were out all day"" was not clear? And of course we were blamed for deprogramming the key...which was not the problem. The lock was sticky or malfunctioning in some way. In any case, as with other issues, housekeeping came up quickly to make beds and replace towels - inconveniently of course as we had hoped to relax before dinner. If you want proximity to the beach, or any kind of ambience, I would not recommend it. We wanted only a convenient base of operations for a few days in Honolulu, and the Doubletree provided that.","Waverly, VA","gtd123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waverly, VA</strong>",46,3.0

The location is good with lots of restaurants and amenities nearby. The area is also relatively quiet.2. The staff are friendly and helpful especially the concierge folks3. We had a ""suite"" which is really one room divided by sliding doors. For a few days with two adults and two teenagers it was fine but think twice for a longer stay. 4. We had two problems... the first was a water glass that had medication left in it by the previous occupants and the second was the room was not set up for four people when we arrived. Both problems were quickly rectified but probably should not have happened at all.5. I read the comments on parking...it is $30 per night and is valet only. I knew this in advance and so was prepared. This was added to my bill later and not requested in cash as one person has written previously.We did not use the restaurant or pool.

I'm not kidding about this, I usually can't sleep in strange beds and the mattress and the duck down pillows were heaven after long days walking, walking and walking more through Waikiki. Our parents were upgraded to an Ocean/City corner room when it became available early that afternoon.The staff were incredibly accommodating to all of our requests and they all knew Waikiki very well and were able to give walking/tram/bus directions to all of the spots that we wanted to get to. The valet staff were very courteous and quick to call cabs and shuttles when we needed them. The cleaning staff made sure that our rooms were spotless. I have read some of the reviews about the noise, but we were pleased that when shut completely the glass sliding doors blocked out almost all of street noise - and there were nights that road crews were working - not to mention a marathon outside the hotel.We would visit Hawaii again (we have plans for the other islands) but we would only spend 1 night in Waikiki again (mostly for Waikele!) but we know that we would only stay at the Doubletree again.",,Kailimccoy,5,5.0

The only inconvenience is that we requested a late check out, so that we would be sure to return in time from the marathon, but they couldn't confirm that until after 6am, which is later than the start of the marathon.

It is very rare to encounter a hotel where every staff member from front desk, to bar, to valet, to housekeeping treats guests to the very best of his/her ability. Each question we had was treated with urgency, respect, and knowledge. An especially big rave review for Ace at the front desk. He was always extremely pleasant and helpful. He really went above and beyond on every question we had. When we asked him about buses to Pearl Harbor, he was knowledgeable and went so far as to print off a schedule and dig up some brochures to personally deliver to us in the business center. A true class act. Also our housekeeping woman was always friendly and asking about our stay. This hotel was apparently recently remodeled and was always clean. Showers were a little small, but awesome and very adjustable. They room was laid out in a way that you don't feel like you are in a perhaps somewhat smaller room. We really appreciated the opportunity to skip a few days of room cleaning in exchange for $10 meal coupons. As for location, we really liked it. It was a quick 5 minute walk to the beach, and a fairly easy stroll to the action of downtown. So you aren't really in the middle of the 'party' action, but that makes for a more quiet sleep, imo. We didn't mind the 10 minute walk to the big shops and restaurants, although there are still a good little selection of restaurants right next to the hotel and with a nearby ABC store you have everything you need at an arm's reach.Of course have to end with, as everyone is raving, the cookies are delish!!!!!

When actually able to check in the receptionist seemed friendlier, and the warm chocolate chip cookie is a nice touch. The rooms are reasonable size, and generally of good standard.

I would be remiss not to compliment the property for having Danny as an associate on the front the desk. Danny always endeavors to provide an exceptional level of service. My impression would be that the inclination of whoever assigns rooms at this property, is to wait and see if you press the issue....versus proactively providing Honors members the benefits of the program. Getting back to a business perspective, the hotel has a nice early evening happy hour with reasonably priced appetizers and a great bar staff. If you are fried from a long day the accomodations and service are appreciated. I will continue to book this property as my experiences have been so very positive. When on business that is a valued attribute.","Saint Louis, Missouri","gary c</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",21,4.0

I mean if excellent means the BEST, this isn't that hotel. But this hotel is better than very good and if you don't need the beach view but want a better- than- very good hotel in Waikiki than this is the one. On an average arrival it is less than 5 minutes from curbside to the room. Each step of the way is not only fast but very courteous and warm, including the cookie!. The rooms are all newly renovated so they are up to date and very functional! And, if you want for anything, the first class front desk can handle any request - at least any request that I've ever made.Location wise, you are a five minute walk from dead center waikiki and only a ten minute stroll to Ala Moana Shopping Center. Honestly, if you are in Honolulu on business, this is the place to stay. If you've visited Oahu on vacation before and want great service but don't need to have a beachfront lanai, this is the place to stay. The only problem is that it's not a secret anymore so the prices have edged up as the occupancy has increased over the past year, particularly in the aftermath of the renovation. It is, however, always my first choice when I am in HNL.","Princeville, Hawaii","Thomas B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Princeville, Hawaii</strong>",14,5.0

Don't plan to have breakfast here as it is very expensive. Room view was of a very small pool and not much else.My husband and I traveled to Hawaii for the first time in January 2012. We planned to spend three days touring Oahu before moving on to the island of Hawaii for five more days. We had a wonderful morning touring the eastern part of the island before meeting an acquaintance at a Thai restaurant near the hotel. Several hours after lunch, my husband became ill and by 9 that evening we knew he was dehydrating and needed to go to the hospital where he was diagnosed with food poisoning. The staff at the hotel was wonderful. They contacted an ambulance for us and within a minute or two had a hotel employee, who was a local fireman, at the room to assist us until the ambulance came. The next day, the hotel desk called us to inquire about my husband's condition. We ended up staying in the room for the rest of our stay prior to moving on to a great experience on the big island.We were very unhappy with a local tour company with whom we had arranged a tour of Honolulu and side trip to Pearl Harbor.

With tourists from all over the world and two major military exercises involving over 30 nations in town, occupancy rates approached 100% in the final week of July. When business is good, hoteliers don't care about you, your status with a brand, or anything except making a buck and keeping the rooms full. My observations follow for your consideration:- HHonors status was never especially recognized at anytime during the visit. It didn't get me a larger room, free water, or make me feel handsome and powerful like other Hilton properties I've visited in the past.- Parking is $30--period. That's the way it is on the island; don't say you weren't told. If you're on an expense account, don't complain, because you're not paying for it anyway.- THIS IS A BUSINESS HOTEL THAT TAKES PETS. If you're interested in luxury, the beach, or are allergic to pets, this isn't the place. I was surrounded by pets on the 16th floor and my room, bathroom in-particular, had the residual smell of urine. - The rack rooms are tiny by Western standards. Internet connections good, Newly rennovated rooms with clean air conditioning ducting. . .except. . . that the AC never was able to keep such a small room cool. Housekeepers shut the AC off after daily cleaning so that when you come home from work around 6 or 7, it's a sweaty, tropical mess.- Elevators tiny, slow, and overused. During my visit the service elevators were out of commission, forcing the hotel staff to use the main elevators, making a bad problem worse.- No laundry on premises; staff advises there is a laundry half a block away; pool is tiny, exercise room small also.- Front desk staff are entry level, inexperienced employees; friendly, but don't know the ropes well. Front desk clerk by the name of ""Ace"", a new employee, was working hard to get me a larger room. 10 for the effort.- Dining Room: Staff task-saturated during breakfast. One morning when I came down with only my key, and making it half-way through my meal, I realized I left tip money upstairs--I let my server know I was going up just a moment and to leave my meal on the table, even using the international symbol of covering the glass with a napkin. When I returned, no meal, clean table. . .sorry. . .no tip.After 3 days of a tiny room that smelled of urine, poor air conditioning and the world's slowest elevator, I went to several properties close by, begging for room at the end.I moved to a competitor property that had a cheaper rate, a larger room, an AC that could let your room double as a meat locker, and a balcony big enough to pass for a 2nd bedroom.How bad was it? Bad enough to give up four additional days of triple HHonors points without thinking twice.","San Antonio, Texas","BruceLansing</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Antonio, Texas</strong>",29,2.0

We were a group of four; each of us had complaints (which will be going to Hilton management). First issue was check-in. Three of the four of us were Gold status with Hilton; none of us were given the perks that should come with it when we checked in. I asked about it, and was assured by the clerk that I wasn't Gold. So, I called corporate -- of course I am Gold. Corporate refused to call the hotel to straighten them out, but when I called the desk and asked them to call corporate to check, they said ""Oh yes, we made a mistake."" Mistake times three? Doesn't work that way, sorry. In general, reception was busy and surly. They were not at all useful in recommending restaurants.Then, I got a handicapped room -- not a huge problem, but it would have been nice if they had asked if that was OK. Issues were that the shower, since it was open, flooded the bath, and there was no counter space because of wheel chair allowances. OK, maybe they were short on rooms. The room was adequate, although there was no place to hand wet towels or bathing suits. No microwave, but a coffe maker. Another of my companions asked to switch rooms after his first night -- his had a cockroach invasion -- bathroom, counter and floor, and the coffee area. (They did so and gave him a nice room.)The pool is on the 3rd (or so) floor. I went out one night and was surprised it was empty but soon learned why. The way it was set up strong winds were channeled through the pool area making it cold to swim; there is no spa. Also, the design of the pool stairs made it difficult to swim laps -- there was no real turnaround area at one end.My room had a lovely view of the roof of the downstairs and the next door hotel. Couldn't see anything green unless I went out on the lanai and leaned over to see the park at the end of the street. As I type this, I can't hear my music over the sounds of the road (and possibly construction) that are coming through the (closed) window. I was also unable to bring the temperature of the room below 74 degrees – a bit warm for sleeping. I would have left the door open, but the proximity to the next door balcony, not to mention the street noise, made that an unwelcome option. Not a holiday hotel --- I've done worse in downtown Pittsburg!Being Gold, once it was straightened out, gave me complimentary continental breakfast buffet. OK meal (cereal, toast, bakery), although short on fruit choices. My non-Gold colleague paid for his breakfast; $16 for a bowl of oatmeal and a pot of tea! If you opt for the hot breakfast it is $22!

Internet is free in the lobby but not in your room, but if you want Internet in room it's $10 per night. Frige not even big enough for bottled waters. Getting in was ok but you can only come in from one side of road so prepare to do u-turns or go around the block. Room is semi-clean..no dirt but no real maintenance (my shower door pops really loud because the hinges are corroded-I'm waiting for it to break). The people and staff were nice but the overall greediness of the hotel is outrageous...stay away from doubletree unless you want to spend a ton of money for items that should be free..",,ACSilverdragon,2,2.0

I asked the front desk for a late check out and the lady at the desk was helpful with that, telling me that it might be available but they'd have to check on occupancy the next day. She provided the possibility of paying for an extra half day for a 6pm checkout or a simple late checkout, if either was available. I called the next morning to find out and they said they could let me checkout only an hour later, at 1 pm.

Our room was located in the dull part of the hotel-the 5th floor, near the streets. Walking out of the elevator, our floor looked completely dilapidated. Our room however, was very clean and the bathroom even better. Shower products were by Crabtree and Evelyn and came in mini shampoo, conditioner and body lotion bottles containing citron and cucumber. Our balcony unfortunately did not shine nearly as close as the rest of the room. The view was street side and noisy. Also, our air conditioning was broken. No upgrade offered to us for being members. Also, do know that it is valet only and charged every day.The service was tiresome. On my first night, I requested a toothbrush. The front desk handled my request in a very timely manner. The person that delivered it to me though handed me the toothbrush by holding his hand in front of me, didn't look/acknowledge me and walked away without saying anything-very cold response. We did enjoy the daily newspaper though. On our last day, we printed our boarding passes complimentary at the business center. We were handed a copy of our bill and two cookies, this time warm. My take on it is simple. There is a cold arrival and a more than warmer get the hell out of the hotel already attitude.

So, I cannot really give a fair review in terms of value because, for us, it was a very good value!The Doubletree in Waikiki is your standard business hotel. I believe this to be an older hotel with recently updated rooms as the rooms were smaller than your typical American hotel room these days. The room was well-appointed with your typical Hilton decorations. We had 2 standard beds, a desk and chair, a dresser and flat-screen TV. There was a bench with drawers to provide additional storage. The closet was built into the wall with cabinetry which provided a European feel and was a good use of space in this otherwise smallish room. I think the best thing about Hilton properties are the beds. I find them to be super comfy!The bathroom was small but also efficient. Doubletree provided the standard soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. A hair dryer was available in the room. The towels were thick and fluffy.I do believe there was a safe provided in the room.Overall, our room was very clean and the hotel generally quiet. The front desk staff didn't go out of their way to greet you like at other Hilton properties I've visited, but they were helpful and happy to mail our postcards for us. The valet staff were VERY nice and helpful. They arranged our airport shuttle for us quickly and were happy to flag a cab. This property also participates in the Green Car program where you can rent a hybrid car for $15/hour or $95/day. We didn't take advantage of this service, but I liked the idea, especially in Honolulu where having a car isn't a necessity but it could make your commute to see some of the sights a tad quicker.We felt the hotel was very conveniently located with plenty of restaurants within walking distance and bus stops close by. There is an ABC Store just around the corner...a small pharmacy-type store basically across the street...and an International House of Pancakes within walking distance to grab a cheaper-than-the-hotel breakfast. The walk to the main part of Waikiki is several blocks long, but the weather is so awesome in Hawaii that who wouldn't want to take a stroll? And, the hotel is near Fort Debussy Park which is nice to stroll through and has great beach access.I have two complaints, and these are pretty standard for me with most properties: 1) Eating on-site is EXPENSIVE and the food isn't that special. We ate at the breakfast buffet our first morning in Honolulu and spent $57 for 2 buffets and the tip! The buffet was your standard American and continental breakfast fare, with some local favorites like Portuguese sausage and rice thrown in. Is $57 worth the chef they keep on hand to make an omelet for you? Not in my opinion. 2) We ladies would like to have a magnifying mirror, preferably lighted, in order to take care of our beauty needs. This wouldn't be that hard to provide, nor that expensive. I have found one hotel that provided a magnifying mirror. I was so excited! Come on Hilton! With your nicely appointed, want-to-feel-like-a-boutique-hotel rooms, a magnifying mirror would really add to to your customers' comfort!All in all, there is nothing horribly wrong with this property. Would I recommend it for a romantic honeymoon? No. Would I recommend it for business travel? Yes. Was it worth the Hilton Honors points? Well...that depends. But, given that hotel rooms in Honolulu usually start around $200, it worked for us. Just don't expect anything special...cozy...boutique-y...but you are staying in Waikiki within walking distance of all of the shopping and beaches. You could do much worse!","St. Louis, MO","Lateralbee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Louis, MO</strong>",59,4.0

Had lovely mountain view from 17th floor the first stay. On the 29th we were on 5th floor all we had for a view was the back side of a crappy apt. building and parking lot. They did get us in a room before check in time though so didn't complain. For the most part the room was fine, the corners needed a little better cleaning. The maids didn't dump the ice bucket daily so finally left a note for them to dump the ice bucket daily. Had to leave a note to keep enough towels for our use. Was a hole in sheet which isn't Hiton standards, called and told them about it. Changed it the next day but a few days later had it back on the other bed...figure out how that happened. If you stay here the Coffee House about a block and a half west is and EXCELLENT place to eat. Large selection on menu and get a LOT of food and the prices are reasonable. The front desk people were always very good about giving us information. One day they had the water shut off for maintance said there would be bottled water at front desk. I went to get some water there was three of us and they would only give me one bottle of water. They do let you print your plane tickets for free but charge $9.95 per day for internet service in your room and a $1.00 per call if you local calls from their telephone in the room....think that is a bit much. Elevators are small with wheel chair three of us in the elevator filled it up pretty good. Over all it was a good place to stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Honolulu. Just make sure you get above the apt. view as it isn't a nice view at all. There is a laudramat across the street so that was handy.

Location wise it's 1 block from the Kalia Tower at HHV. Rooms are nice, I understand that it's been recently refurbished, which no doubt makes the rooms a pleasant place to be. Bathroom is a little small, but the walk-in shower is excellent. I wonder if they could have made the bathrooms a little bigger when they refurbished?As a Diamond I got a high floor, free Wi-Fi (which I'm using now - it's fine) and free continental breakfast ... however, given that there's the excellent Wailana Coffee House, an IHOP, a Denny's and other breakfast places very close by I wouldn't pay for breakfast here ($16), or even the $9 uplift for hot breakfast.There's traffic noise when the doors is open or when sitting on the balcony, but I quite like the buzz from the city. Quiet with the door closed though. I can just about see Diamond Head from the balcony (over the top of the Waikiki hotels) ... so called mountain view.Air conditioning is also very good and really quiet.I like this place, I'll be checking the prices here for my next visit.",Warfield,"LordBofW</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Warfield</strong>",84,4.0

I've stayed at this property several times because of its value. I am happy to say that the hotel has finally undergone renovation and the rooms have been significantly updated. If you are a visitor on vacation, I would recommend you stay elsewhere if you want to be close to the beach and the attractions of Kalakaua Avenue. For business, it's great because you can get in and out of Waikiki easily. The staff, particularly the valet parking folks, are efficient and friendly. So, too, the front desk. I was disappointed in two things. First, the hotel charged for Internet use in the Business Center. That didn't seem right, particularly for a Gold member. I also was disappointed that I couldn't take a few things to go from the breakfast buffet before heading off to a meeting. I never had a problem before taking fruit and yogurt, for example, if I don't have the time to sit down and dine. I've been able to do this at other Hilton properties, from Hilton resorts to Hampton Inns), but I was told it couldn't be done at the Alana. Oh, well. I guess every location has its own policies.

Still, I got some good exercise walking back and forth. The rooms were definitely the high point of the stay. Very recently remodeled, immaculately maintained, great shower and air conditioning. I had a lanai with a view of the ocean off in the distance. The service from the employees was friendly and cordial. They have a nice pool but it tended to get rather windy on the pool level. The gym had a great selection of cardio equipment. However there were a few minor bumps in the road that colored my stay. There were repeated elevator issues and one day 2 of the 3 elevators were out of service. This was a huge inconvenience in a very full hotel that was almost 20 stories. The breakfast in the restaurant was always disorganized with stacks of plates on empty tables and buffet trays that had not been replenished. I couldn't really complain because breakfast was free for me but it was obvious they were having some organizational issues.

As a result, I cannot comment on the hotel as a whole but I had a very good experience. The property is on the Ewa boundary of Waikiki and is a comfortable 15-20 minute walk to Ala Moana Shopping Center (where the race started), and the same time to the middle of Waikiki, or to the beach. I booked a king/mt. view room for one hundred thirty five bucks, which was a great price for the time and place. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. At check-in, I was given a (space-available HH Gold) upgrade to a penthouse king suite. The room itself was fantastic and since my stay was so short, I really did not get to take advantage of the space. However, it was very comfortable and was all that should have been expected. I loved having the fresh breezes blow in from the balcony. The view was “okay” and the Wi-Fi was fine, though, I did not stream content. I didn’t use the whirlpool tub but the shower was excellent. Because of the marathon, I requested and was given a late check-out without any second thoughts on the hotel’s part. I had three nasty blisters and asked the nearby housekeeper for a sewing kit. Within a couple of minutes, the kit showed up at my door and staffer refused to take a tip. I didn’t have a car but had a visitor park for two hours at a very small rate. The Sunday paper was complimentary where a number of Hilton properties I have stayed at, any paper delivered is automatically charged to the room unless a request is made to stop delivery. For HH members, the points/money splits could end up being very good values. Not all properties do that. Obviously, because of the upgrade, this stay was a tremendous value. On price alone, it appears that the stay would have been a good value. This property is away from the major crowd crunch. If I need to stay in this area again, I will consider this property.","Klamath Falls, Oregon","IchiroK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Klamath Falls, Oregon</strong>",17,4.0

There are several stores and places to eat within the area, either local or one of the chains – although if you are a Red Lobster fan, be prepared for a wait, I was told the one by the Hotel is the only one in the area.Because it is smaller, it almost has a boutique feel to it, a big plus is that getting to/from the room and out and about was quick and east.Granted the Hotel Building is a little older, but it has had a renovation recently and I was pleased with the room and the public areas. Being in a Suite was definitely a plus, gave us a little more room to move around, so if you have the option I would go for it. As others have mentioned, try and get a higher floor room, but don’t worry about a view, the ocean view is one of those – “Its over there” typesThe Staff was fantastic, warmly greeting us when we arrived after a Very Long and Tiring flight, and remembering us throughout our stay, asking how things were and asking after my Son – who sadly was unwell for one day, which sucks on a vacation!As others have mentioned, the Parking situation isn’t great – but $30 a day is in line with most other hotels in Downtown Honolulu so I guess you cannot fault them for that, a little investigation and if you don’t mind a little walking back/forth there are cheaper options.I didn’t like their business center– we needed to print out tickets for an activity, but to do anything in there – even check email - required $$$ in the slot .I guess it depends what you want – this isn’t a resort hotel , but it doesn’t pretend to be, it isn’t a 5 star Hotel with all the trimmings, but it doesn’t pretend to be that either.

Not too much hassle on the street. However it is about 10 min to the closest beach and is sharing with Hilton village a few minutes away.If you are a honors member, you will be disappointed due to the lack of amenities that other doubletree hotels provide in the mainland. E.g. Are 30 buck overnight parking, no American breakfast buffet, no complimentary upgrade of the room and very slow Internet. Despite which side your room is, the views are the same, so I suggest not paying extra to have a higher floor or a sea view room . The biggest thing is that there is no self parking and we are stuck using services from valet. I think this is quite annoying as every time you pull your car in or ask them to bring your car, a tip is expected ( and I mean not just a couple of bucks) but about 10 dollars. The front desk is ok, I will not rate them as ooh- wow. The breakfast was also sub standard and I don't know why they are charging nine bucks to upgrade from a continental breakfast. The fitness centre also needs renovation.After walking in the nearby shopping district, I saw plenty of other hotels and with cheaper rates plus breakfast options. If I was not a honors member, I would have chosen them over doubletree. In fact I would go ahead and advice all honors members, particularly diamond members to not to stay here - I know your expectations and this hotel cannot fulfill any of those.

Probably true of anyother hotel in Honolulu- Breakfast is available but it's expensive as is the case with everything in Hawaii- Housekeeping comes in at very strange times like 2 or 3 PM. This is not a huge deal but it's a little unexpected- The hotel is about 0.7 Miles from where everything happens on Waikiki i.e. The major shopping strip, beaches - If you are on higher floors (we were on 17) and you page 10 bucks more, you get a view that includes a slice of the ocean somewhere over there. - The pool is tiny. Feels awkward to be in there with anyone else. They really need to fix the pool situation ASAP. No one expects an olympic size pool but come on, that pool is pitiful. - Internet is free only if you have status with Hilton otherwise, it will cost you 10 bucks a day I believe.I like this hotel but if I wasn't a Hilton Honors member that also wanted to save about 40 bucks a night, I would have stayed at hotels that were closer to everything with private beaches. They were cheaper than both the Hiltons on Waikiki. All in all, this hotel will not blow you away but it's all good.

It helps a lot when you open the curtain on the sliding door and let the natural light in. The decor also seems European, a strange dark European look to it. The bathroom is very modern and the walk-in shower is fun and shot out plenty of water. It also had a nice sitting area for... perhaps... the application of make up.I thought the bed was very comfortable and the room was very quiet even though I was right over the street. No noise and I slept like a bear in hibernation. Had a flat-screen TV and an adequate desk. I only wish they had a power outlet up on top of the desk instead of under it on the wall.Anyway, there were two things that stand out that I just love in a good hotel room. First of all, it had a small couch, a loveseat really. I really like to have an alternative place to sit when in a hotel room. The office chair is OK, and sitting on a bed becomes tiring on my back. This loveseat was comfortable and nice.Second, there was a small refrigerator in the credenza. I wish more upscale hotels would just get rid of their mini-bars in favor of an empty refrigerator instead! I like being able to get snacks and sodas from the area convenience stores and keep them cold. This little amenity just makes my stay great.Also, I need to mention how friendly the staff is. Anytime I encountered a staff person, they always said hello and had friendly small talk for me.

The bedroom can be closed off though and it's quiet. The service here is great and they seem to value your patronage. Beware that there is only valet parking and it's $29/day which is typical of Waikiki.

The outrageous charge for valet parking ($28 a night) deterred me from renting a car, so I was relegated to the city bus for the duration of my stay.

The online directions from the airport are easy to follow. It was easy to pull-up and hand my keys over to the valet ($29/day with NO other options...not too atypical for the area). My greeting at the front desk was fantastic and my HHgold got me upgraded from a king room to a penthouse suite. It was FANTASTIC in this instance to have the dining/conference table in my room to spread out and do last minute work. The bed was VERY comfortable and decor was fresh and modern. I had a light meal at the restaurant that night which was perfectly tasty and well priced. To address the negatives written by previous reviewers- the bath: yes, its slightly small and NOT meant for more than one person BUT I am an average height woman and found there to be no issues with sitting comfortably in the tub. In fact, I really appreciated how deep the tub was and enjoyed having a jacuzzi bath in my room. The shower is also very nice and the shower head is on an aesthetically pleasing sliding rod to fit even the tallest people. The tile scheme was very pleasant and everything was CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN!Location- its about a 5 minute walk to the start of all the big shopping in Waikiki, a 5 minute walk to the beach, and I felt completely safe walking as a single woman. Although I enjoyed my upgraded room, I did use a standard room as part of their hospitality suite (so if you have a later flight you can still wash up before heading off) and it was also clean, well decorated and relatively spacious. The negatives- the pool is a simple but functional pool with plenty of chaise chairs...some of the beachfront places have more creative pools (not a big deal to me...). Its pet friendly WHICH I THINK IS GREAT!!! but there was a yappy dog next door to me. I called once to notify the front desk which did not seem to do much to help the situation. Luckily I was exhausted and the bed was REALLY comfortable....once I was asleep, I slept through the night like a baby (i hardly EVER sleep through an entire night!). For allergy sufferers, I saw firsthand the steam-vac type of industrial machine head into the neighboring room the next day and despite being an animal lover, I am allergic and I had NO issues.

The hotel does not have it's own airport shuttle, so you have to either take a taxi for $35-$40 or one of the shuttles for about $9 per person. We opted for a taxi because it was late, then were in terrible Friday night traffic. Upshot is, next time I would stay near the airport. But the Doubletree is a lovely hotel and cheaper than the mega beachfront properties. You can still walk down the block to the beach.

They know our entire family and ask about our day (my children have started school while we're living in the hotel); they are great to the dog; they know what we want for breakfast before we even ask. They truly anticipate our needs.Breakfast is very pricey here ($13 for continental and $6 to add on eggs/bacon/omelette) but if you're a HHonors member, you can get a voucher for a free continental breakfast. The breakfast staff is great and the made-to-order omelettes are worth the extra $6.

Of course, we found out they only had valet parking and it was $27/night, so we decided to get dropped off. When we checked in, the customer service we received was friendly and professional--they also gave us warm chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies and then we went off to our corner room. It faced up the Ala Moana Boulevard toward the shopping center, so the view wasn't that great. There was also construction going on across the street, but they can't control that...My main issue was the fact that our ""ocean view"" included 2 small strips of ocean on the horizon because the hotel is a few blocks from the beach. The room, on the other hand, was recently renovated, so it was pretty nice. It had a contemporary feel to it. By the way, they charge $10/day to use their internet service. We thought about ordering room service, but they didn't have many choices and it was only available for breakfast. In any case, overall, we enjoyed a relaxing night's stay, but I don't think it would be worth it to come here again, even at 1/2 the valued price because you could get a better deal (with a better view) elsewhere.","Kaneohe, Hawaii","iceskater48</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kaneohe, Hawaii</strong>",54,3.0

The facilities were clean, and the hospitality was great. The restaurant food was also superb and the fresh cookies which guests have access to in the lobby, was definitely a bonus. The location is not right on the beach, but about two blocks over, so it wasn’t that bad of a hike.The Cons: Checking into the hotel as a military member on PCS orders using TLA was a complete disaster! Paper work was lost/misplaced by staff, they didn’t delay charges until TLA was reconciled, and even over charged our cards when attempting to make a payment! I would recommend that military personnel, who plan on using advances/TLA to stay, try to get that paperwork done before they check in if possible. The staff practically reinvented the wheel when it came to our stay, but the island is practically %40 military! Also, plan on parking at the Hale Koa lot across the street to save money, or suck up a $27 a day charge to have your car valet parked. There is no self service parking. The internet is only free in the lobby, and must be paid for while in the room. That was another negative.

Room was a little cramped for 4, although it had 2 queen beds and newly remodeled. Bathroom was small, and had no counter space, but there was plenty of storage outside. TV signal quality was pretty bad when we were there. We were told that they're moving to digital HD soon. Room was facing the back of some other slightly run-down residential buildings, and a busy road beyond, but it was fairly quiet (ninth floor). WiFi was not free, but you could get it free in the lobby. Parking was an extra $27 a night, which we didn't take (rented daily from Hertz in the nearby Hilton Hawaian). Didn't use the smallish pool, and beach access is a ten-minute walk via Hilton Hawaian. We had opted for the room rate which included breakfast (for an extra $40 per day for the 4 of us), but this was not a great value. At the restaurant right next door, you get breakfast deal for $5.99 (2 eggs, hashbrown, toast and coffee), which is more than adequate. Location is good if you want to go to Ala Moana center, but a little away from the main Waikiki shopping. There are restaurant choices within minutes of walking, including Thai, and an ABC store and 7-11 are just around the corner. The front courtyard where you arrive is very small, and the bellman service is inadequate. Overall, a functional place to park yourself at a reasonable price (and good savings) in Waikiki. Nothing terrible, and nothing exceptional, this doubletree is a simple decision based on budget - and for the price - it's not disappointing.","Hyderabad, India","BRajagopalan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hyderabad, India</strong>",29,3.0

Most of the Waikiki hotels seem to have either two doubles, or a single king. That's not good when you have teenagers. About the only ones that DID offer dual queens were on the beach and more than double the price. No thank you. Once that was out of the way, we realized how well it would serve our needs. The hotel is within walking distance of everything. The beach is a 5-10 minute stroll, and there are a lot of stores and shops nearby to find those knick-knacks everyone wants you to bring home. The rooms are a bit cramped, but still comfortable - it's not like you're there for more than sleep anyway, though.We didn't try the hotel restaurant, the one morning we tried was our last day and they didn't open until later since it was Saturday. Most of the restaurants are down towards the beach, but there were a couple close by. We ate several times at the 24-hour Wailiana Coffee House which is just a block away and enjoyed it. We tried the Cheeseburger Waikiki next door as well. I wouldn't bother with it again, though. Overpriced tourist chain, in my opinion. The hotel does force you to do valet parking - something I always dislike, but there's no street parking so you have to add an extra $25 per day that you have a car there. We did a lot of roaming throughout the week, so it was mandatory for us. We noticed there were several car and motorcycle rental shops nearby so if you can plan your trip with sightseeing on certain days, this might be the better way to go.The hotel web site says their renovations were complete in early March. We were there late March and early April and there are still some going on. Not on our floor, though, and they kept what little noise there was during waking hours and to a minimum. Water was cut off a couple of times, but we always had notice the day before, so that was helpful.If you are taking bus tours, you will have to be picked up elsewhere, the hotel doesn't have good access for buses to drive up or wait.The biggest gripe I really have about the hotel is that we asked for a mountain view room on a high floor and were given a low floor with an ocean view. Maybe they figured the ocean view was an upgrade, but when there's a lot of buildings between the hotel and the beach, an ""ocean view"" doesn't offer much. By the time we opened the windows to check, though, we had already unpacked everything for the week and we decided it wasn't worth the hassle.We were very pleased with the value we got here. If you just want a place to keep your things while you venture around, this is a great place.","Frisco, Texas","MarkL_from_TX</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Frisco, Texas</strong>",7,4.0

It is located a few blocks from Waikiki beach just outside the main tourist district. We stayed three nights for sightseeing at Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head and other areas and, since we are not beach people and didn’t want to stay at a resort hotel, we found this place perfect for our needs. It is an easy walk to the beach, perhaps a half mile, but if the purpose of your trip is to spend most of your time with sand and surf, you might want a place that is closer to the ocean.The staff was terrific, particularly in helping us with the shuttle buses that run around the island. When we needed help in our room, someone was there within minutes. On our second day, the manager greeted us in the lobby and asked us if we were happy with their facility.The room was spotless as were the public areas. We did not try the restaurant since there were several eateries within a block that suited us just fine. Fresh chocolate chip cookies were available at the front desk each afternoon (yum!).Many of the guests appear to be business people, and we saw some airline flight crews, which meant that it was less likely that we’d have a noisy night, and this turned out to be true.As vacation travelers without a beach agenda, we would definitely stay there should we visit Honolulu again.","Fresno, California","Trains26</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fresno, California</strong>",19,5.0

We LOVE the cookies they give out upon check-in and check-out! So tasty. The room was beautiful, and we had a partial ocean view! The hotel was quiet, the bed HUGE, soft, and comfortable, and the room was as clean as I like to keep my home. Didn't find a speck of dust or stray hair once during our 3 week stay. The pillows were plentiful and comfortable, the sheets soft and plush, and the room temperature was easy to regulate. There were also TONS of towels readily available, and we received a morning newspaper every day of our stay. The gym was great--not huge, but nicely kept, with great equipment. The pool was also really nice--lots of kids and families on vacation! The hotel also has a small business center, which was great when we needed to print out and make copies of lots of PCS paperwork.The hotel itself is in a great location--just minutes from the Waikiki Strip/Kalakaua Ave, and within easy walking distance of Subway, two ABC stores, Ala Moana Shopping Center, Cheeseburger Waikiki, and many other great restaurants and shops. Parking fees seemed a little steep, but as our car hadn't arrived yet, we walked everywhere :) My one complaint was that the in-room internet was $10 per day, but the lobby provides free wi-fi and internet via the business center computers, so it's really not a big complaint.

I read a review or two that said the front desk was not friendly and I had the complete opposite experience. I arrived a little late and they were especially gracious.... I definitely experienced Hawaiian hospitality from everyone to front desk, housekeeping, to bellperson...My room was newly renovated and pristine. The bathrooms are updated and modern however, there is almost no counter space. I was a solo traveler so it was no big deal. Also, 5 stars for housekeeping. They do a great job and were very friendly.All good so far.The down side is I had absolutely no view at all... I had a small balcony but it looked straight at another building. Not the end of the world because I was working and barely at the hotel. The property is walking distance to the beach (a short walk). Also, it is undergoing renovation. This was not a problem for me because I left the hotel every morning by 8 am to go to an office. But I definitely would have been bothered if I were staying here on vacation.Here is what I know from the time I was actually there. The water was turned off intermittently between 10am - 3pm for 2 of the 5 days I was at the hotel. There was also extremely loud, constant drilling / banging the one day that I was free from work. Luckily I had plans to be out of my room in the morning but it was relentless from the time I got back to my room around 11am until I checked out around 1pm. I'm sure it probably went on all day and most likely the days I wasn't there earlier in the week. Again, this wasn't a problem for me because I was working during the day and things were quiet by the time I got back. But vacation travelers should be aware of this renovation and maybe contact the hotel to see if it is going on before they stay here. Definitely not noise you can relax or sleep in to!!!Overall it is a nice place in a very good location - easy access to Waikiki beach, shops and restaurants. My rate was also reasonable. $189 for the weekend night I stayed and $149 the rest of the week.

We would just let them know when we were taking the dogs to the park and they would clean the room while we were out. It could not have been a more perfect arrangement. The valet staff were always smiling and welcoming. The front desk was so helpful in extending our stay multiple times and were quick to offer up those wonderful fresh baked cookies.

There is more to that – the Doubletree Alana hotel Waikiki has the worst front desk staff ever – there was no eye contact with the guests, nobody ever smiled or showed the acclaimed Hawaiian hospitality, I would rather describe their attitude as neglectful, uncaring and rude.

As a business traveler this hotel is nice for avoiding the tourist stuff. Most of the rooms are clean but some showing their age. That said it still much better then most of the dated rooms further down the road. The good news is this hotel is scheduled for remodel this summer. The lobby is done and I was shown the two sample rooms. Both samples look great and bring major upgrades to improve this hotel. I can't wait to return to see the improvements.Fitness room is above average with Precore equipment. Restaurant is OK but there are better options elsewhere. Staff is small but helpful. Bed are better them most of the standard Waikiki fare. Showers, well they'll improve soon.Now what could be improved. Location is challenged but has a great view of the park. Valet parking is too pricey. The room rates are lower but over $24 a day is robbery even for Honolulu. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE put in laundry. I'd pay $10 extra to be able to throw a load. Again we'd pay extra for a washer!!!!If your looking for the total Waikiki experience you should stay elsewhere (recommend Ohana East for budget travelers). This hotel is a bit of a walk to the beaches and many of the food options. If your looking for a better then average Waikiki hotel that is affordable, this hotel is a great buy and perfect for business travel or those that don't mind a little walk off the beaten path.

From the moment we boarded our Hawaiian Airlines flight, we fell in love with Hawaii. We had never been to the Islands, and it is true what people say: one visit will change your priorities. I booked a long weekend at the boutique Doubletree Alana Waikiki at a great package-rate to surprise my husband for Valentine's Day (coincidentally, there was also a corporate business meeting in Honolulu which he could attend while we were there, so he had the chance of visiting with associates as well - bonus!). While the Doubletree hotel is pretty basic in amenities and in need of some updating, it was clean and comfortable, and check-in went smoothly. We had a standard room with no view and the bathroom tub was quite small, but who goes to Hawaii to stay in their hotel room anyway?! The staff is very knowledgeable and excellent at restaurant recommendations, and this hotel has a partnership with the Hilton Hawaiian Village which has many bars, shops, and restaurants conveniently located on the 5 minute walk to... world-famous Waikiki Beach! Even in February, the sun was shining and the water was wonderful! We also rented a car from National - remember, most Waikiki hotels only offer Valet parking, so that is an extra nightly charge to consider (the costs vary). However, it was worth it for the beautiful drive up to the Polynesian Cultural Center on the other side of the Island (excellent luau experience), as well as the Diamond Head crater (gorgeous view from the top of the walking trails!) and Pearl Harbor - all of which are must-sees! Basically, if you are in paradise, I do not recommend spending much time in your hotel room anyway... but if you do happen to stay at the Doubletree Alana (and it does cater well to business travelers), expect basic amenities and friendly service in a FANTASTIC location and you will not be disappointed!","Portland, Oregon","1happycouple</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",15,3.0

This trip would be a business trip where my wife would accomodate me so she can sit on the beach all day as I work. I called for weeks before out trip to see if there would be an upgrade availble when I arrived. I was told over and over that there would be an upgrade. When we arrived, we found out that not only was there no upgrade (even though I am a diamond member) and on top of that we would have to wait 2 hours to check in (even though I requested early check-in). After waiting two hours to check in, we were given a normal room. When we got off the elevator on the 11th floor, we found an entire SWAT team in the hall way with guns drawn. There were guys on the floor being arrested and the SWAT team guys were yelling and telling them to get on the floor. The SWAT team had to escort us to our room and when we walked in we immediately saw a couple cockroaches. I called down to the front desk and told them that I wanted to switch to the Hilton across the street. All of a sudden there was an upgrade available. They told me that I could move to the 9th floor into a suite. I agreed and switched rooms. The room was bigger but still felt old and dirty and looking out the window we could see the dirty area around the hotel. My wife was instantly turned off by this hotel, so we decided to make the switch to the Hilton. I paid almost twice the original price to stay across the street but it was totally worth it. I still wasn't completely impressed with the Hilton either but it was a lot better. Don't waste your time at this hotel! BAD, BAD, BAD!!! P.S.

The rooms were DIRTY. And I don't mean tropical humidity, old building dirty (which I am very aware of as my immediate family has lived in Hawaii for a very long time and I can distinguish the difference), I mean the cleaning crew is not cleaning dirty. Our room had a wetbar with a sink; My husband thinks the uncleaned mess in the sink was from oranges that someone had eaten and I still think it may have been vomit. However, it was there the WHOLE TIME we stayed; We stayed for 3 nights. The room hadn't been dusted for months. There was so much dust build up on everything, from the lamps to the TV to everything. It was a really thick layer. The tub hadn't been cleaned for at least a few months. The floor of the tub had a very thick layer of black, the kind you get from not cleaning your tub. If my tub at home isn't cleaned about every two weeks we begin to get this dirt build up; however, this had been built up for a long time, which means it hadn't been cleaned for a long time. I loved the card in the room that read "" my name is (fill in the blank here), and I have scrubbed, dusted, and polished your room for you"". I can't believe they have the nerve to put something like that out in the rooms! Our ultimate favorite though; the roommate we had. It was a lovely large roach who also hung out the whole time in our room. I do have to say that the beds are very comfortable but I seriously doubt the cleanliness since there does some to be an unkept trend here. We did get a good nights sleep! You have to walk to Waikiki but it definitely is doable and not too long of a walk. We weren't on vacation so it didn't matter to us. I would not stay here again AT ALL.

Upon arriving at the hotel we checked into our room quickly enough which was a junior suite on the 5th floor. The room seemed OK size wise as far as sleeping our 3 young children and us. It had 2 twin beds and a fold a bed couch. View was of the pool and parking area. Bathroom full of mold and mildew. Carpet was in terrible shape and I found all kinds of junk and old food under the beds. The room is very noisy, right next to the elevator and the road noise round the clock was very loud. The second day we were over run with ants small little red ands covering the entire sink and everything around it. They send someone to deal with it and we ony saw a few here and there the rest of the stay. Our 3rd night while on the balcony beer bottles came flying down and into the pool. Called the front desk and they send someone to look and that was the end of it. Noticed a lot of people with dogs and the hallways usually smelled of dog as well. My wife got bit by something on the face as well but not sure what. Parking is $27 a night!!!!!!! Right around the corner is several abandoned buildings and a large concentration of hookers. The last night we caught a roach the size of a silver dollar, and a huge silver fish we found in the process and took it to the front desk. They claimed it was an outdoor roach, but did comp us one night for free. I would not stay here again as the cleanliness level is terrible. The staff seemed friendly enough and the valet parking was always quick. I didn't tip the valet as I shelled out so much for parking in the first place. One tip for you. As you depart the hotel (one way) turn left at the second light and head back to the marina. Huge parking area (FREE) and access to the beach area right next to the Hilton Village lagoon pool and a huge stretch of beach. Head toward the dock as there is less rocks. 60 feet out is a reef for snorkling with lots of fish, eels, and other sea creatures. If you park at the Hilton Hawaiian Village its $28.50 no matter how long you park there. In a nutshell if the cleanliness was better and the insect infestation went away and the parking was cheaper, I'd come again. My kids are still terrified about the roach incident.

Last year it was the exercise room and pool area. This year the lower lobby is getting a face lift and I have been told that next year some of the rooms will start to be renovated. The rooms are not large but certainly adequate for the price paid if not a little tired looking.I was more than a little put off with the amount of dogs (as in canines) staying at the hotel though. I like dogs as much as the next guy but I don't think a good hotel is the place for them. I am not talking little dogs either.

The Doubletree Alana's rate actually costs me more than what I paid at the Hyatt. That may have had an impact on my impression of the hotel. We arrived at the hotel early in the morning and stored our luggage as the room was not ready yet. We waited at the pool while waiting for the room. The place advertises a gym and we laughed out loud when we saw their exercise equipment. There were 2 pieces of equipment by the pool that were rusting away. We laughed more when we saw the showering area to rinse off before/after going in the pool. It was in the corner hidden by make-shift lattice barrier and anyone walking on the street by the hotel looking up can see you rinsing off. We were so disappointed that we were immediately started searching the internet to find another hotel in the area if we could get one at a decent rate knowing that we would loose the prepaid rate we paid at this hotel. But since it was peak holiday season we could not find anything and ended up staying here. We booked an ocean-view room, which again was laughable. You had to lean over the very small balcony very far and you could see a sliver of the ocean far off in the distance. The room itself was decent (standard Hilton room) and room service food was decent as well. We ate at the hotel restaurant and I was in the mood for edamame and ordered a meal on the menu that included edamame. I was surprised when it arrived and no edamame. I asked the waitress about it and she checked with the chef who explained that they were changing the menu. This should have been told to us beforehand, but I did not want to wait for them to cook something else. When we tried to use the television check out service it did not work and had to wait in line to check out. We were not expecting this and were nervous because we had a scheduled ride coming to pick us up to go back to the airport.

Directly across from an open park (great for walking, jogging or pets) the hotel is near Hilton's Hawaiian Village --- a multi-acre paradise of waterfalls, nightly torch-lighting ceremonies, great dining and upscale shopping. Also nearby are Red Lobster, Outback Steakhouse, IHOP and a host of local dining options. Anything you care to see or do is an easy stroll from your room here.We spent five days and four nights here in January 2010 and discovered that the hotel has nearly completed a ground-up renovation. There's a heated pool on a view deck about three stories up; adjoining the pool is a first-class fitness center and workout room. Our continental breakfast featured fresh-squeezed juices, an array of fruits that tasted local and fresh, plus excellent Kona coffee. Every face in the Doubletree is friendly; every ""aloha"" comes with exceptional service and courtesy.This was our second stay at this property: We returned on purpose because of the prime location and the amazing service. The hotel was everything we remembered and more: warm, friendly, walkable, refreshing.","Del Mar, California","DrFrisbie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Del Mar, California</strong>",131,5.0

Rates can vary from $99 and up, and many include continental breakfast making it a good Waikiki value.

Of course, the reason I picked this hotel is I had a free room coming to me from Hilton . . . and was only staying in Waikiki one night (which is about all I can handle . . . too touristy) If you want Hawaii, the real Hawaii, go rent a house, like we did on the Big Island . . . and rest.But anyway, we were greeted promptly. Even arrived early and the room was ready! Actually, we got upgraded to a junior suite . . . I guess being a member of Hilton Honors pays off! We were on the 14th floor. I noticed no mildew smells, the windows in the hallway were closed. The air conditioning in the room worked fine . . . nice large balcony, living room, bedroom. Room was nice and clean. Yes, the hotel's older . . . what building in Waikiki isn't? Most of the high-rises were built in the late 50's, 60's and early 70's.Yes, it is undergoing renovation . . . didn't know about it either. Big deal. It's nice to see a company reinvesting in its properties. Didn't hear any noise from it. Saw the artist's renderings and samples of the furniture . . . will be real nice when it's done. Never heard any garbage trucks. The view from the suite on the 14th floor was absolutely fine . . . could see the ocean, the green tree tops from the park across the street . . . and yes, some high-rise apartment buildings. A rather nice view I would say, but then I like high-rise living and enjoy seeing different styles of architecture.Staff was helpful and friendly, answered our questions, called the taxi service for us . . . taxi was there at the time we requested. The chocolate chip cookies (a Doubletree thing) were delicious as usual.Best of all is this hotel's location! It's a little bit away from the heart of central Waikiki (just fine with me!) But we like to walk . . . so no big deal to walk down to the Royal Hawaiian for Mai Tais! There's a Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurant right next door! Delicious. ABC stores abound . . . and the Hilton Hawaiian Village is an easy walk at just one block away. Fort DeRussy Park with its nice section of beach is also very close.Again, take these reviews with a grain of salt . . . I've noticed there's a lot of fussy travelers out there when there's really nothing wrong with the place at all.

Here are the good points, so as not to come off as a complete downer...1 - The people who worked there were excellent. They really tried to make our stay comfortable. 2 - We got a good deal with the Aloha special - 5 night stay, the 5th night is $50, we also got 2 commemorative Quarters with the state of Hawaii on them, and $50 towards the spa at the Hilton Hawaiian Village or towards the restaurants.3 - We got free continental breakfast each day. If we wanted to upgrade to the Full American Breakfast or have eggs or waffles with the continental, they didn't charge us for the full meal, just he difference in price. So that was a good deal there. The food was good, both at the breakfast and at dinner. No lunch is served because of the renovations.Here are the complaints:1 - They did not inform us that the hotel was under renovation.2 - The first room we were put in smelled like mildew.3 - The hallways had windows open, so as soon as you left the room, you were hit with the heat and humidity of the outside.4 - The hallway was not vacuumed all week.5 - No good views from either side of the hotel. Both overlooked residential apartments. We heard the trash collection from the 15th floor daily as well as the police and fire truck sirens.6 - The spa at the Hilton Hawaiian Village was terrible - had the worst manicure of my life. All the nail polish was old and very little left. No wonder when they charge $40 for a manicure and $60 for pedicure. And it's not like they gave you any special treatment for that money - would have been cheaper to go to the mall for the treatments instead.7 - Not within walking distance of Waikiki. So I'm not really sure this hotel is in Waikiki. It was only close to the Hiltan Hawaiian Village, which is a very impressive hotel. I wish we had stayed there.Anyway, I do not recommend this hotel. We travel a lot with Hilton properties and this is not one to go back to.","Boston, MA","EC-Boston</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, MA</strong>",2,1.0

I booked on the Hilton Website and was surprised as I was searching for a hotel they had a AAA rate called the Spring Special of $ 99.00 plus tax so I jumped on it. I was actually considering using points at either the Hilton or the Marriot but for the $ 99 rate it was not worth it to use the number of points either of those properties wanted.I did not rent a car due to the Stiff valet charges of $26.00 per day for parking. When I arrived at HNL I used Robert’s Hawaii shuttle. The cost is $9 one way or $15 round trip and you can reserve your return pick up in advance via phone. You are allowed two large bags which are placed under the bus for free and your carry-ons may be taken into the bus. You find the stop in the airport and can pay the driver upon boarding. I was offered an requested a “Standby room upgrade” on the web site when my reservation was made to a Suite Supposedly 650 Square feet with kitchenette and Ocean view for an additional $9 per night. Upon check in this was not offered or even mentioned and as a Hilton Diamond member it was kind of disappointing. I had reserved a room with two queen beds which was supposed to be upgraded to an Ocean View but received a room with a city view. Since I saw the property- I did not think you could even see the Ocean from any room as you were surrounded by other tall buildings. I suppose if you were on top floors you could catch a fleeting view of some water. The only perk I was offered as a Diamond member was the same cookie everyone else received and I did choose free internet ($ 10.95/day instead of the free continental breakfast or points). There is no executive or Concierge level thus there are no free drinks or breakfast here for the Gold/Diamond members. Since I had requested a quiet room not facing the busy street I did not complain as my room 801 was quiet even though it was not the upgraded room which was printed on my reservation.As others have commented the room was not very big. It did have a mini fridge and microwave and was the 2 queen kitchenette which I had reserved. I wanted to be able to keep my beverages chilled instead of purchasing from the hotel at the sky high prices Hawaii is famous for.The fitness center was nice and had 4 treadmills. The pool area was also ok for taking a quick dip for those not interested in going to the beach. These are located on the Mezzanine level.The bathroom was also small and the Japanese tub was kind of cramped even for showering as other reviewers have mentioned.Housekeeping was fine and did not bother me when my “Do not disturb” sign was out. I left a small gratuity on the bed daily to assure reasonable service.I requested late check out on my final day as my flight was not until 10 pm. I was given until 2 pm and after that I checked my baggage with the Bellman and went sightseeing. Unfortunately the hotel does not have a hospitality suite to allow guests to shower an change before their flights. Since I had a late one I got my bag from the Bellman and donned a swimsuit, then used the shower in the pool area which is outdoors to wash, and used the pool towels and changed and freshened up in the bathroom by the fitness center. This is the only way around them not having the Hospitality Suite. I have suggested that they get one as most guests do have late flights out.The Doubletree is at the top end of the Waikiki strip so it was the first stop for the shuttle. It is only about 1.5 blocks from the Hilton Hawaiian Village and about a 5 minute walk across Ala Moana Blvd. That is where the beach is if you are interested. Dining options are numerous within walking distance as there are some fast food places like Subway, IHOP, and ABC stores (3 within 2 blocks), There is a a Tony Roma’s across the street. There are also numerous local places (Cheeseburger Waikiki, Kobe Japanese Steak house, and all the eateries in the Hawaiian Village) nearby.I would walk to Waikiki (about 15-20 minutes) for shopping and food and the Convention Center is about 3 blocks. One could also walk or take the bus to either Waikiki or to the Ala Moana Shopping center which is about 4-5 blocks up Ala Moana Blvd. There is a nice Asian style food court there with many choices from Korean BBQ to Lahaina Chicken.I visited the Honolulu Aquarium which is at the far end of Waikiki and was not impressed. For the $ 9 admission it was very small and there is minimal to see. I would not recommend.I also went on the “Haunted Honolulu Ghost Walk”. It cost about $ 30 and was about two hours. It was more for the history and the views then to see any restless spirits. They do have a bus our to some “Haunted places” but I could not make that due to my schedule. They say the bus tour is really scary??Overall I would say that the Doubletree Alana was worth the price I paid but if I was to pay $150 or more (which was what some of the published rates were) I think I could find a place that had a little more to offer such as the Hilton Kuhio or the Waikiki Marriott.I would recommend for those on a budget who are not afraid to walk as I was.

The room was clean but rather small for an American hotel. I bruised my leg when I slipped trying to get into the shower/tub the first day. It's a big step up to get into and very slippery. The shower head was a little low for me, and I can't imagine how awkward it would be for taller men and women - although a hand-held attachment is also available. The toiletries provided are from Neutrogena and include a face moisturizer with a strong SPF. We were able to book a room with a small refrigerator and microwave (not all rooms had a microwave) for a discounted rate. The view from the 7th floor on the ocean side was nothing to write home about, but we didn't spend much time in the room. My colleague's room on the other side (mountain view) on the 8th floor was a little nicer. The fitness center is small but well-equipped. The hotel is a short walk from the convention center, the Hilton resort for beach access, and the restaurants/shops/hotels in Waikiki. I stopped at the ING Cafe across the street each morning for a bagel and coffee (large coffee for $1!!). The air conditioning never seemed to get our room very cool. We found out in the middle of the week that a colleague had a room in the nearby Ilikai Hotel that was twice as big with a complimentary continental breakfast and a large balcony with an ocean view for only $30 more a night.

The staff was friendly and accommodating allowing a family member to check in even though flights delayed our arrival several days. He big shock came when a large security guard and front desk manager pounded on our door within 15 minutes of our days late arrival aggressively alleging we were smoking something funny in our room. Although I appreciate their desire to monitor the activities in the hotel, I did not appreciate the approach. It made for a uncomfortable stay. The GM was less than sincere with his apology and a veil of suspicion hovered over what should be a happy occasion. On the last day of our stay the our room attendant finally noticed there were three guests registered. She left a few extra amenities and a extra packet of coffee without charge (they normally charge you for additional coffee packets.)

We know the property is not on the beach, but an easy walki to the Waikiki beach and shopping areas. We enjoy being away from the crowds and the smell of suntan oil. The employees are terrific, especially Danny who made certain we were pleased with our stay. The rooms are good sized, well maintained, and I believe offer a good value when compared to the other beach properties in the local area. Previous reviewers commented on the dated furnishings and mildew. Guess I don't go looking for this and given that most hotel rooms are used by thousands of guests, some who take care of their surroundings, this hotel has very well maintained rooms and facilities. There was no mildew in the bathrooms or carpeting, both were very clean. The suite we stayed in had a separate bedroom area, a living room area, and a small wet bar area with an in room coffee maker, sink, and small refrig. The room had a combo of tile and carpeting, with an extra wide/long lani. Thick white towels in the bathroom were great. The bedding was excellent, including the pillow topped king bed. There is free internet service in the lobby and for a fee available in the room. The lobby is quiet and was handy when using the internet. We did not come to Hawaii to work so the lobby area was adequate for our daily searches of things to do in Honolulu. The staff was very helpful in providing printed directions to various sites using The Bus, Honolulu's public transportation. The pool area is nice, with chaise lounges and tables provided for guests. Large pool towels are provided for guests in the pool area. But who wants to use the pool when there are miles and miles of beautiful sandy beaches in Hawaii. The fitness center is nicely equiped with gym equipment. While there the hotel had a very large group of high school students staying there. The staff did an amazing job of keeping them on certain floors and from bascially taking over the property. Hats off to them! I will continue to stay at this property for it's value and comfort.

Dinner though - under chef Johan - is over the top. We have eaten at all the eateries on the island - Roy's in Waikiki and Hawaii Kai; Alan Wong's, etc -- and just spent two years eating our way through Italy. We know our food and appreciate quality. The menu at J's is great and each presentation has gourmet touches. The wine list is interesting and we tend to enjoy eating in the Bistro wine bar upstairs where Erin tends the bar on weekends. The atmosphere is dark and intimate -- more often than not, Johan will bring our food to the table himself -- a touch we learned to appreciate in Italy and never thought we would see back in the USA.

On the weekends on either end of the trip, we stayed at the Ilima (see my review of that property) for half the price and a bigger room, so I'd recommend the Ilima over the Doubletree any day. However, the room was nice, if not spacious, and the beds were comfortable. My big complaint was the bathroom, which smelled dank. The smell turned out to be because the just-bigger-than-a-phone-booth sized shower had a curtain which was 3"" too small on each side, so it was impossible to shower without flooding the floor and getting the outer curtain wet, which then smelled. A bathroom exhaust fan would have been a wonderful thing, because our swimsuits and beach towels never dried overnight (adding to the funk), even using the handy retractable clothesline in the shower. The mini-fridge was a nice thing to have. Our daughter thought the fourth-floor outdoor pool was novel, if small, until she realized how very chlorinated it was. She took a long shower afterward trying to get all the chlorine washed off. The valet-only parking just makes the cost-to-value worse. My husband discovered that if he took his laptop down to the lobby, where there was free wireless, then he could continue to get the free wireless in the room for the day. Overall, there are better places to stay, but the property could solve a lot of my issues simply by having shower curtains that actually fit the opening.

I work for the Hilton Hotel system so my review is pretty particular when it comes to cleanliness and the attitudes of the staff. I believe the staff & the cleanliness of the hotel can make or break your stay. Anyway, here's my opinion.... The hotel is slightly above average. I say slightly because the hotel was just a hotel. An average size room, a bathroom, and an older style TV (no LCD screens here). It had a balcony that overlooked the mountains & the city, and the lighting was nice. We had a large closet, a fridge, & a safe in the room. The room was extremely clean, and although we didn't use the housekeeping service the entire stay, the housekeeping workers were always on our floor and always friendly. There are 4 things that weren't satisfactory in our room. The air conditioner couldn't be turned down past 70 degrees. I understand that Hawaii is trying to conserve electricity, but it was definitely hot on the 15th floor when you were trying to sleep. Also, our room faced the mountains & city. It was pretty loud at night because of the main street (kalakua avenue) that people constantly cruise at night. Sometimes it sounded like the police sirens were outside of our window! Another complaint is the ridiculous bathtub/shower. I read all the previous reviews about the ""furo"" asian soaking tub, but I seriously laughed out loud when I saw this thing. To take a bath/soak, you would have to sit Indian Style. It was pretty humorous. We took showers the whole week, but you can forget about 2 people fitting in this tub/shower thing together! haha. The last complaint is the parking. We rented a car, and paid more to park the thing at the hotel than it was to rent it! This hotel is not located in the middle of Waikiki, it's actually on the outskirts, so why is parking so ridiculous? It was 25.00 a day to park, PLUS TAX! I actually work valet & front desk at a Hilton hotel, and wow I have never heard of tax being charged on the parking... oh well. (Hawaii tax is pretty cheap but still). The valets were not very helpful & some of them were pretty rude. They didn't open the doors to help out, they didn't offer directions, and they didn't thank us for staying there. They didn't even put my 2 very large suitcases in the car... my husband had to do it. Please make sure you tip these valets for the service they give you, not because you are supposed to. Anyway, now for the good parts. The check-in was smooth, the front desk people were very helpful & knowledgeable, the cookies they give you at check-in were pretty great! The area is pretty good, to the left of the hotel is a couple restaurants including Tony Roma's & Cheeseburger Waikiki (both very good) around the left of the hotel is a Subway, and an ABC store. The hotel is on Kalakua & Ala Moana (2 main roads in the Waikiki area) and within walking distance of ALOT of fancy stores & great eats! The hotel also has a martini lounge & restaurant.... didn't eat there, but it looked pretty nice. The hotel wasn't fancy, but it was sufficient for what we needed it for. It was about a 10 minute walk to the beach, and many times we just walked over to the Hilton Hawaiian Village and used their beach, lagoon, and pool..... these were VERY nice. I highly recommend you using their facilities. The Doubletree's pool is heated (which is a plus because the ocean is FREEZING!) and it goes up to 6 feet deep. The pool at the hotel was never crowded because many people head over to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The fitness center looked extremely nice here in the hotel though. The concierge wasn't very helpful, we asked about tours and what we should go & eat while we were in town, and he handed us a book of all of the islands, that's all. Didn't recommend anything, just gave us a book. We had a late flight on the day we were due to check out, and the manager allowed us to stay all day for a $40 charge... very nice & helpful. The 12:00 check out time wasn't long enough for us... our plane was due to leave at 10:10pm. We were able to go to the beach all day, then shower before we had to get on the long flight back to Indiana. Overrall, the hotel was a little above average, and they definitely have the room for improvement. I wouldn't pay more than $150 a night for it, but the front desk staff is nice.

The first room I had was ocean view on the 7th floor. Room was nice and I had a small wedge view of the water but because of the overnight noise level of other occupants on the floor, I asked to switch rooms the next day. I had booked a city/mountain view room so I must have lucked out at check in to get the ocean view room. The next afternoon the hotel staff was very accommodating and moved me to the 12th floor to a corner room. This time I was facing the city/mountain side (like I booked) and faced a large apartment building. I think the room was smaller and it was not very clean (dusty) but it was quiet and since I was there for a business trip, much appreciated.The rooms have a small refrigerator but no honor bar.

The extra space definitely helped as I do have friends on the island that I entertain. As the previous reviewer noted, the staff were very friendly and quick to respond to requests with absolutely no attitude whatsoever and i must admit I was really relieved to see that. The high shower stall didn't really bother me because the water pressure (which is really more important) was perfect so I didn't mind my morning 'hurdle jump' into the tub that much, lol! The beds were as comfortable as I could ask for and after 4 nights of partying non-stop (this is the Pro Bowl, remember?), a good nights' sleep is just what the doctor ordered. I love sleeping surrounded by pillows and they definitely give you enough. The location may be a problem for some since it's not exactly 'oceanside' but the beach is about a 5 minute walk so I considered it my morning exercise before relaxing in the beautiful waters of Waikiki (let's get our exercise on people, lol!)My only suggestion to the hotel is maybe upgrading the TV's to Plasmas, after all this is 2008 and the big bulky televisions are old-school!

They also allowed me to leave materials for someone to pick up at a later date. The housekeeping staff also responded quickly and efficiently to several special requests. The staff at the restaurant and bar were equally attentive and the garage attendent had a cab for me in less than 5 minutes.Beds: Quite comfortable with plenty of pillows.A small fridge was also in my room.Bath: Nice towels and ammenities.What was not so nice:View: I had a great view of two apartments from my 14th floor room. Not much else.Noise: Sitting on my lanai was like sitting on the stoop of a row house on a busy street. But, that's Waikiki.Bath: If you are a senior or anyone who has difficulty moving about, stay away from these rooms. The small tubs have very high sides and I'm sure anyone with mobility issues would find it difficult to shower. As someone over 6 feet, I also hate low shower heads.

Next time, I will spring for the Hilton.I was traveling on business, so I don't need anything fancy. Cleanliness, however, is not negotiable. The room seemed okay at first, if you can ignore the noticeable mildew smell and noticeable wear on everything in the room. However, the bathroom and floors were just disgusting. The carpet was filthy and black along the edges of the room, the shower curtain and walls had mildew on them, and the faucets and shower knobs all had soap scum crusted all over them.My companion and I tried to arrange for a late checkout to ease the pain of our red eye flight on departure, and the whole thing was a complete debacle. The front desk staff didn't seem to know what to do with our request and had to refer it to a manager, who then called to confirm but failed to make note of it anywhere. When we stopped by the front desk to check, we talked to the same woman as earlier in the day, who acted like she had no idea of the conversation we had had with her about 4 hours earlier. After all that, there was still confusion on check out and I had the maid repeatedly knocking on my door asking when I was leaving. I didn't eat at the hotel at all, so I can't comment on that. The location is nice because it is within walking distance to both Ala Moana shopping mall and the downtown area, as well as Waikiki. It took a while for taxis to come in the morning, however, so it is probably best to arrange those in advance or just walk out to one of the bigger roads. The views are questionable if you're not a high floor.

Blow dryer, iron and ironing board are provided in the room and you can watch some free channels or order movies and pizza with beer for $12 bucks!! The pool was nice and warm and NEVER crowded. Only a few folks at a time would take a swim, I guess everyone perferred to walk to the beaches. Although they serve dinner and breakfast at the hotel's restaurant, we preferred to eat at the 24 hr coffee place down the block. It's open daily and they serve, breakfast, lunch and dinner. We went there once and the line wasn't long, but if you go and there is a line, it's worth the wait. Other nights, we took a few steps to the Cheeseburger Waikiki restaurant or crossed the street to eat at Tony Roma's or just walked over to Señor Frog's and Altlantis Seafood. My favorite spot was at the Shore Bird Grill about a two blocks down from our hotel and right next to Fort de Russy. We grilled our own shrimp and steak and the ocean view was beautiful. From there, we took a stroll on the beach and walked into any bar hoping from the beach. It was great. BEST OF ALL, since we booked our hotel through their website, we were able to get it at a lower price PLUS since we have AAA, they offered another discount. All in all, we loved the Double Tree Alana Waikiki Hotel. It was wonderful. I highly recommend it and please, if you can walk, do it and enjoy it. Expect for it to be hot, but there is plenty of shade everywhere and you can always walk into any store (ABC especially) and cool off.

As it turns out, the hotel only has two Penthouse suites located on the top floor (19th). It is situated at the end of one side of the building and right outside of the doors, there is your elevators and ice machines (we couldn’t hear the elevators as 1: there wasn't really anyone coming and going on that floor or 2: they insulated the sound very well). As soon as you open the door, you have the bathroom on one side. The bathroom is a decent size, but it was surprisingly small considering it was a suite. (See pictures; the pictures make it look better than it really was). Other reviewers have mentioned that they have spotted molds in the bathroom. I myself did see a few speckles around the toilet (however, armed with a packet of antibacterial wipes I was more than ready to combat them). The bathtub is what they called the “furo” tub so it was very tall. Therefore, one should be extra careful when getting out or you will get hit! There was a shower head and handheld spray situated oddly in the middle of the wall as well. The only discrepancy that really bothered me was the shelf above the sink. While it was handy to stash your own amenities, it covered the faucet and there was barely a 10” gap opening between that and the sink. So bring a cup to brush your teeth or use the one from the hotel. Otherwise you will have a very difficult time. Strangely, the bathroom is shut by a very dated sliding door. Next to the bathroom, you have a vanity area with several quartzs. Basically it was just a marble slab with a bench and two sconces positioned on top of the glass on one side with recessed lighting above.Okay, so here's a quick rundown of the room:The positives:- Free cookie at Check-in (not the greatest cookie, but it was warm)- All the employees we’ve encountered were super friendly- Tons of storage space if you are planning to bring plenty of clothes. There is a big walk in closet with ironing board & iron with wooden hangers (as well as a flashlight). There is also a pullout for laptop on the night stands as well as many drawers.- Very soft and comfortable bed, as they claimed that it was custom made for them by Serta. However, if you are over 6ft tall you might want to sleep diagonally as the bed is short in length.- Two balconies (one large, one small)- View of the Fort DeRussy Park and ocean afar is quite beautiful (see photos) but it’s kind of blocked by many other hotels close by.- Unique art pieces in the room and bathroom (quartz mostly, but feels very dated) - Free HBO - Coffee pot with two packages of free coffee (caffeinated and non caffeinated) and condiments packs- Neutrogena soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion- Hair blow dryer in bathroom, but it seemed like it wasn’t used in ages as there was a lot of dust stuck in-between the flip buttons- Mini refrigerator that’s empty for you to stock up on snacks! The negatives:- Not close to the beach. It is situated at the beginning of Waikiki so you can avoid crowds but it also means long walks. (Set aside at least 20-30 mins if you want to get to get to the end of Waikiki; i.e. the Zoo) - Lobby for check-in is actually on the second floor, which means you have to lug your luggage up the elevator or escalator. But before you can do that, you need to go up several steps of stairs first. - Very tiny elevators. One will possibly fit at most three people with three suit cases.- Local calls are not free, I think they were $1.00 per use plus surcharge for each minute - Newspaper (USA today and The Honolulu Advertiser) delivered to your room is not free. The price is added to the price you are paying for the room, but they say it can be refunded if you tell them ahead of time that you don’t want it.- Rusted bathroom door- Parking: there is only valet parking which is currently at $19 a night not including tips- Glass sliding doors to go out to the balconies/ deck are difficult to open. It needs cleaning/ oiling.- The small balcony looked right into the adjoining suite's balcony and the building across. The chairs were also starting to rust.- No complimentary slippers or robe - Room is small for a “suite”- Buildings all around the hotel block majority of your view- There is only one light in the bathroom and it is right above the sink; making the room seem dimmed- Large red spots on the green carpet by the sitting area- Outdoor deck is connected to the other room’s deck and there is a locked glass door by the elevators adjoining them (where everyone can just look in).- Room was not insulated well from outside noises (we heard a car start its engine from the parking lot below). Overall, the deck is the only thing that made getting the penthouse seems worth it (as the inside of the room is a bit worn out). From the hotel pictures and the fire exit plans in the room, the 19th floor suites seems like they are all of equal size in dimensions. If you don't need the deck, then you are probably better off getting a regular suite. Even though the deck is connected to the deck of the other suite, it is still a nice place to relax and bask in the sun. Just don’t expect total privacy as the hotel is surrounded by so many other buildings towering over it on both sides.",Hawaii,"Placidrain</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hawaii</strong>",58,3.0

I am a frequent business traveler, so my priorities are a lot different than most visitors to Honolulu. I like to stay at the Doubletree for the following reasons: 1. good location at western margin of Waikiki (my office is near the airport), 2. hotel is good value, 3. rooms clean and beds comfortable, 4. in spite of being located on Ala Moana Blvd., hotel is very quiet because windows are nicely soundproofed, 5. quick and easy to get in and out of hotel, 6. good inexpensive restaurants in the vicinity where the locals eat (try the Wailana Coffee House or Eggs n Things for breakfast), 7. staff friendly and helpful, 8. hot gooey chocolate chip cookie upon check-in.I don't recommend the hotel for honeymooners or those that want the hotel itself to be the fun experience. For that, better to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, Marriott, Sheraton or one of the other big hotels with shops, parrots and all the rest. Also, hotel not recommended for those that want to be on the beach (10 minute walk).

I agree with another review that with a family of 5, there are limited choices. We have been very happy with the Alana. I sit here in the suite typing this review with our incredible Hawaiian trip almost finished. The staff here has been wonderful. We had been told before leaving Iowa that we could use the Hilton Hawaiian Village facilites since the Alana is a Hilton property, but the front desk said that was incorrect-you had to be a Hilton club member to do this. Well, I can still say, my family really enjoyed the HHV's pool. The one thing that did bother me a bit was my thinking that the USA Today and Honolulu papers at the door every morning were complimentary-however, the small print shows that you are charged for them unless you tell them not to. Not a deal breaker. It's just a short walk from the Alana to Waikiki. The valet parking is about $20 a night if you decide to rent a car which we did for a couple of days. The pool at the Alana is not bad, small and heated and cozy. But everyone has been so nice here and helpful. Everything you need is within easy walking distance. We are very happy that we are staying at the Alana and would recommend it to anyone. The rooms are clean and the cleaning staff is great too. But you will find yourself not staying in your room for much of your trip I hope. Finally, it is a bit noisy at night on the street, but hey, if you want total quiet, dont stay at a hotel on Ala Moana and close your window. All in all, we love our stay and think you will too.

I a travel agent friend recommended this property but it is definitely sub-par! I have stayed at many Hilton properties and never had a room that was this disappointing.We checked in late on Friday night and when I got to my 16th floor room it smelled horribly like mold/mildew. Although it is a smoking floor, the smell was not smoke. It was like a dirty, moldy bathroom. I called the desk and was offered to move to a room on the 6th floor (at midnight after a 14 hour flight) but they warned me there was some sort of teenager group staying there and it might be noisy! No thanks! Next they brought up a dehumidifier that looked like it was made in the 1960's and hadn't been used since then. When the woman turned it on it blew out big dust bunnies all over the room! I barely slept that night and had to keep the balcony doors open. The next morning I inquired about being moved to a comparable room and was told they were all sold out. Maintenance came and changed the filters in the vents and the AC but it still smelled. I woke up sick 4 days in a row and kept the balcony doors open almost all day and night. (Beware if the little birds who will fly in if given a chance) My colleague informed me that her room did not smell that bad other than the bathroom.Other issues: The noise was horrible, every time someone opened their balcony doors I was woken up. The bath tub was about 3 feet long and 3 feet deep. I guess ""soaking tub' means for soaking legs& feet? i am 5'9"" and could not ever fit in this tub! The shower curtain did not cover the length or width and the floor got soaked every time I showered. The ""fitness center"" consists of 2 treadmills and a bicycle outside next to the pool. After almost $4000 for 2 rooms/ 9 nights they then told me at checkout in the morning that there was no place to take a shower before our 9 pm flight. My friends who stayed at the Hilton were allowed to use a hospitality suite after checking out in the morning.I will say the concierge and the server we had at the restaurant, Tina, were some of the nicest people I met on O'ahu. Also my room was cleaned everyday and the housekeeping staff were very friendly and courteous.After walking around a lot I would strongly recommend staying further down Kalakaua Ave. at the Sheraton, an Outrigger or at the Hilton Village even if it costs a bit more.",travelpro7777,"travelpro7777</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>travelpro7777</strong>",5,1.0

As with a lot of hotels in Waikiki, there is only valet parking available, which is $19 a day. It's about a 5 to 10 minute walk to Waikiki Beach via the Hilton Hawaiian Village, which wasn't really an issue for us because that was not the reason for our trip to Honolulu. The front desk staff were quite nice, and we were given a room that is the closest to having an ocean view. The room (1219) its self was adequate, nothing spectacular and one of the smallest rooms on the floor, with a lanai, comfortable king bed, and desk, but oddly no other table or chairs. The room was behind the elevator shaft which was quite audible, but the real problem was the bathroom. On the hotel's website, and in guidebook reviews, they make a strong note of the Furo style soaking tubs which we were looking forward to. In our room at least, it was a square with no light where there wasn't much room to stand in, much less soak. Perhaps they confused ""soaking"" with deep, for it was extremely difficult to get in and out of, and we're limber 20-somethings. The shower curtain was completely useless.....it wasn't wide enough to cover both ends of the tub, so water would seep out everywhere onto the floor. The taps for the sink were located under a shelf that ran the length of the wall and were very difficult to turn on and off. The spout was under the shelf as well which made it challenging for face washing, teeth brushing, etc. There was also a clear acrylic shelf hung low that was nearly invisible, so invisible that my fiancé cut his head on it.We didn't eat at the hotel, rather we walked to Ala Moana Center's food court or further into Waikiki. We didn't use the pool or fitness center either, but we did use the business center a few times for internet access, which costs $1 for 5 minutes.We were told that the most discounted general rate (the Friends & Family rate can only be booked by a Hilton Family employee) for the time we were there was $169. If you come to Honolulu specifically for Waikiki, stay elsewhere.

Full 180 degree views of the ocean and the city. We even had a great view of Diamond Head. The room was huge with 2 balconies. One was your average hotel size…..the other was larger than my living room at home. It was beautiful with cedar floors, wood patio furniture and a cloth covered roof. The room was very large and spacious as well. There was an area with 2 couches and tables and TV. There was also a bar area. The 2 balconies with sliding glass doors made it feel so open. And waking up in the morning with these amazing views all around you was priceless.The free breakfast bar was good and the $5 upgrade to the full buffet was really great!Our second night there at the end of our trip....the hotel was booked solid. So this time we were only upgraded to the 18th floor. The room was clean and I did not see any mold that others have mentioned. The shower was oddly small, but clean. A nice room, but clearly nothing like our experience in the penthouse.We asked about late check out since our flight did not leave until late the next day. Even with the hotel completely booked, they accomodated us. They called at 7:00 am and told us we could check out at 3pm. Then they held our bags for another couple hours while we had drinks at Cheeseburger in Paradise down the street. In short, we were very pleased with this hotel. Though we did stay here for free. If you can get the penthouse...do! We felt like rockstars with the rooftop gigantic balcony!!",Michigan,"jlefief</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Michigan</strong>",62,5.0

It wasn’t so bad to see it, but to smell it is a different story. It was so gross. We arrived there at Midnight so we didn’t have any other choice but to spend the night.

I was very upset to see the negative reviews, but there are no refunds with Priceline. I called the hotel directly to ask for a QUIET non-smoking room (I told them I didn't care about the view, as long as it was quiet). The person I spoke to was somewhat rude, once she heard I had purchased thorugh Priceline, and told me they could make a note of the no smoking request, but couldn't guarantee any other requests. As I hoping to to relax, and celebrate my birthday, this was not how I wanted my trip to start out. I decided to see what happened and deal with it.I arrived around 9PM in the 40-day downpour that covered Hawaii. I checked into my room, which was clean, a good size and had a lanai, and faced the city/mountain view. The distance from the street was adequate, and traffic noise was not an issue as long as the lanai door was closed. I went to eat in the hotel restaraunt, wich was very small, with a very limited menu. I ended up ordering a small salad, which cost $13. It was not good. I asked how late the hotel bar was open. 10Pm closing. I returned to my room. However, it soon became evident that there were ""Spring-Breakers"" in the rooms around mine (room 406), as they darted in and out of rooms, made lots of noise, and were obviously having parties going on simultaniously. After an 11 hour flight, I needed my sleep. I went to the front desk to complain. To my surpirse, they immedialtely moved me up to the 16th floor, room 1602.This had the same view, but was at the end of the building. The room was clean and quiet, and I was quite satisfied. I stayed a total of 4 nights, one more than I had originally planned, due to the rain. My final night, booked with the front desk, cost $159.In review, I have to say that the Alana exceeded my expectations, and I had a pleasant stay. The bad raps listed here are not justified, based on my experience. The room was clean and well kept. The free WiFi access in the lobby was very useful, and I eventually made use of the in-room wired connection, which was $10 per 24 hours.

We were mostly impressed with the individual staffers, but the managers we encountered seemed in over their heads.The location is OK, but not great. It's a 10-minute walk to the Hilton stretch of Waikiki Beach. If a view is important to you, don't stay here. Our room looked directly into a condo tower that was located across the alley from the Alana.The room was clean and of a decent size. The bathroom was small. The furnishings seemed fresh, but they were starting to show a bit of wear.Because of the very limited climate controls, it was necessary to sleep with our sliding door open. If you can sleep with traffic noise in the background (and the occasional siren, car alarm, backing-up garbage truck, etc.), you'll be OK. It was loud even though we were on the 17th floor. If you need a quiet environment, go somewhere else.Self-parking is not an option. Valet parking was $14 per day with in-and-out priveleges.As Hilton HHonors Gold VIPs, we were not offered an upgraded room, which was very disappointing. We did receive continental breakfast vouchers. Continental breakfast was mediocre, consisting of bread, bagels, small pastries, cold cereal, cottage cheese, hard-boiled eggs and fruit. Without a voucher, the continental breakfast price was $11.95, which we thought was an outrageous price for what was offered.There are two computers with a connected printer available in the business center for those who don't bring laptops. The charge was 20 cents per minute with a $3 minimum. I used it once, but gave up in frustration as a manager and his assistant discussed video surveillance options with a contractor. They were clamoring about where to place the cameras. This is a small room, and it was very uncomfortable. Accomodating guests, you think, would be a priority -- seems like this same exercise could have taken place when no guests were in the business center. And think about it, if the Alana requires video surveillance in this room, which is located directly off the front desk and requires a hotel key to gain access, you might think twice about staying here.We walked by many hotels on Oahu we wished we would have given a chance instead of the Doubletree Alana. Look around -- you can definitely do better than this property.","Edmonds, WA","Mobile10757</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonds, WA</strong>",31,2.0

We also like the pool which other reviewers have complained about. It is not a big pool, but it was heated and warm which is what is important to us. We checked the Hilton pool, and several other more expensive hotels, and all of their pools were ""freezing"" cold.What we didn't like: check-in. We reserved a room with 2 queen beds, but were told at check-in that they only had rooms with 1 king bed. After about 15 minutes of negotiating, they finally found a room with 2 queen beds on a lower level. We also didn't like the fact that the bathroom did not have a fan, and the air in the room became quite humid after morning showers.

This was the official meeting hotel so I didn't have a choice in accomodations. Nonetheless, prior to traveling to HI I of course checked out the comments on Trip Advisor but came away confused as to what to expect. Previous comments really ran the gamut, and as it turned out weren't always accurate, so I thought I'd try and set the record straight here (at least as of August 2005).Location: the hotel has both pros and cons regarding its location. It is less than 1 block away from the sprawling Hilton Hawaiian Village, and a 10-15 minute walk into the heart of Waikiki. (Note that some previous posters mention that you have free use of Hilton facilities, including their pool, but I was told by the Hilton staff that this was not true.) The Doubletree also borders Fort De Russy park which is a nice urban green space. A number of chain restaurants (Planet Hollywood, Hard Rock Cafe, Red Lobster, etc.) are close by, as well as some local places. Also there are several rental car offices close by, for those who want to get out of Honolulu for a day. Unfortunately, because the hotel is relatively small and set well off the beach, there are no views of the ocean from the lanais. Oh, I suppose if you are on the top floor in the correct corner of the hotel, you might be able to see some water. But if you plan to stay here, plan on seeing nothing except urbanization in all directions. The hotel is bordered by Ala Moana Boulevard which can be busy (and noisy) at all hours.Rooms: clean and generally well-kept. You have free use of a small fridge and an in-room safe. However, the rooms are small, especially the bathrooms. Be prepared for a weird half-tub shower thing that's a bit awkward to get in and out of because of the tall sides. Decent selection of TV channels. Wireless Internet throughout the hotel for $10/day or $50/week. As mentioned there are lanais big enough for 2 chairs and a small table, but see above regarding the views.Amenities: here the Doubletree suffers. The pool is really, really small, and the whole pool area is composed of just a few lounges and chairs on a concrete patio with no real view. No hot tub. The ""fitness center"" is actually a couple of treadmills located outside right next to the pool, and I mean about 5 feet from all the kids splashing around. There is a business center, though I didn't use it, and an ATM in the lobby. Service: the hotel staff is friendly and quick to please. The restaurant staff is, however, atrociously slow. Many of my colleagues tried to eat breakfast on the 1st day of our meeting and ended up waiting over an hour for their food. I myself ate there twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner (in the upstairs wine bar), and both times waited 45 minutes after placing my order for the food to arrive - and this was at very non-busy times. Apparently this is a top-notch restaurant in terms of quality, and I admit the food was very good, but the lack of prompt service essentially makes it a non-option for anyone wanting to eat in a timely fashion. Try the Wailana coffee shop a few doors down for tasty, cheap, and quick comfort food instead.Summary: the Doubletree is okay if you don't care about views from the rooms and you don't care about the pool, and if you just want something clean and basic that's convenient to everything else.","Tucson, Arizona","dpb132</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tucson, Arizona</strong>",71,3.0

We preferred the quiet and less crowded swimming pool at the Alana over the noisy pools at the bigger hotels, though. We would definitely stay at the Alana again. Hint....for excellent, inexpensive Vietnamese food (not licensed but you can bring your own wine or beer), go to the small family run restaurant around the corner-near the 7-11 and the laundromat. Approximately $10 p/p, including tip, excluding the wine or beer! It is not at all fancy but it is good and the owner/cook will prepare the dishes any way you want.
