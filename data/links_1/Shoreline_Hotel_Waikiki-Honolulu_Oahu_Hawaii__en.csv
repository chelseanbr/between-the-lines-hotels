Because of this, some services were limited or suspended at the hotel and surrounding establishments.Most importantly I would stay again.My room was comfortable and sitting out on the balcony to eat my meals or just relax after an outing was very nice. You can see the ocean from the roof top pool or the mountains north of the hotel. The hotel was a clean and vibrant colored establishment.The location was great!You're approximately 2 city blocks from the beach and surrounded by food spots and shopping like Ross (literally across the street) to the trendy high end ""i spent it cause i have it"" shops like Jimmy Choo and Coach.Even though things were different than usual, the service I received was solid. Cheyne was my first contact when I valeted my car. He was welcoming and answered all my questions about rates and what to expect while leaving my car with him. April checked me in and was very sweet and soft spoken. I also ate breakfast at the onsite restaurant take out only and was pleasantly pleased.I would suggest the hotel this hotel to others. It was clean. I felt safe. The location was great and service from staff met my standards.","Boston, Massachusetts","Andre_Agile_Wing</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",0,5.0

However, I can't recommend this property. The level of customer service I received was shockingly hostile. If there is a misunderstanding/miscommunication/disagreement, prepare for a steady diet of deny/deflect/accuse. I had an issue at check-out and had documentation, that I pointed to, supporting my interpretation of the information. I was not seeking money. I just wanted some acknowledgement of my position and some form of apology/empathy. Instead I was made to feel like I was trying to rob them. Calls were not returned, emails were ignored and promises of ""I will respond to you tomorrow"" were broken. Even if you have documentation and the names of employees, prepare to be treated poorly. The smirk I got at check out clearly said, ""We have your money and you have an Uber waiting for the airport...buh-bye"".","San Diego, California","Oregonic</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",5,2.0

We would have left the first day and gone somewhere else but we paid in advance and Shoreline would only return 50% of our money so we stayed.Everywhere we went in the hotel it was dirty including the bathrooms in the lobby, the elevators, the carpet in the halls, our room etc. The clean area was the lobby itself. The room itself was small for the price we paid. There was no microwave in the room. You get two free bottles of water everyday but the bottles are only about 4 ounces so they are very small. The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything happening in the other rooms on your floor. The pool is on the roof and you must use the stairs to get to the 15th floor from the 14th. If you have trouble climbing stairs you won't be able to use the dark murky pool that awaits you. Be careful when entering the hotel. The steps leading to the front door are broken and dangerous. Once again if you have trouble with stairs this could be a problem for you. If it has been raining be careful when you make it to the top of those stairs because the pavement at the top is very slippery. Even the cheapest hotels I have stayed in offer some kind of food in the morning but not the Shoreline. The hotel only provides coffee and they had no creamer the last two days. The staff at the front desk couldn't careless about our concerns. Only housekeeping workers seemed friendly at this hotel. The decor was old and nasty.

I had two brand new pairs of sunglasses I had bought in Hawaii stolen from my luggage bag! I had packed them away with all my other purchases and belongings. Did not realise until I arrived home and we couldn’t find them both, not just one, but both pairs stolen from my bag!! Lock your bags when you are not in your room because clearly the staff go through them and take what they think you won’t realise until it’s too late. Absolutely furious and really dampened our trip at the end. Enjoyed our stay here on our honeymoon minus having to have cold showers for two days because of issues with no hot water. But the feeling of someone literally going through our bag to then find both my sunglasses and steal them from me is shocking! I called Shoreline twice after we had returned home and I still have no response from a manager as I was advised - it must be a regular occurrence I would imagine! I was able to pinpoint the two days these would have been stolen from me in our room also, and still no response hence why I have no choice but leave a negative review as clearly I will never see those sunglasses.

It was our second hotel in Waikiki during our honeymoon so we were already familiar with the area and it's right in the thick of it, easy to walk to everything nearby. This did mean we could hear some noise on an evening (we were on the third floor, I'm sure this isn't as much of an issue on higher floors), but this wasn't too much of a problem as our air conditioner pretty much covered that. We had a little bit of trouble with valet parking as we arrived quite late on our check-in day, but we were able to get a slot the next morning. The reception team were really helpful in directing us to a very close alternative car park. The reception is gorgeous, as vibrant and welcoming as it looks in the pictures, and the room is lovely too. Comfy beds, with a nice, big bathroom. The branding is awesome and very consistent. The welcome treats were ace too! We had a brief visit to the pool area and it's small but gorgeous, perfect for a quick dip.

We chose this hotel primarily due to price and proximity to everything we wanted to do - one block to shopping and dining, three blocks to the beach, etc. First off, *only* book through their website directly. Almost all hotels in Waikiki seem to charge ""resort fees"", but with the Shoreline, if you book right through the hotel's website, they waive them, which saves you a lot of cash! They also had a AAA discount (5%, I think), which was great. As for the hotel itself, you can tell it's been recently redone. It's bright, colorful, and clean. That being said, you can certainly also tell it's an older hotel that's been ""freshened"", so it's not going to have the ultra-polished look that new construction properties tend to - regular bathroom tile instead of sleek marble, etc. That was no problem at all for us, since we didn't plan to spend all day in the room anyway! The best parts about this hotel were the little ways they added value to the cost of the stay. Most of them were actually really minor in hindsight - complimentary coffee and fruit-infused water in the lobby, for instance - but they really did add up to make us feel like the hotel cared about the guests and wanted them to walk away feeling good about their stay. They even had a little complimentary basket of snacks in the room when we checked in! I've stayed at plenty of hotels that were multiples of this price that didn't do that. Make sure you check out the rooftop pool, even if you're not going to swim. Beautiful views of the city and the ocean - perfect for instagram!

Our room was on the 12th floor (near the top floor which was all I had made a special request for.) I had noted that we expected it to be less noisy and thereby easier to get a good night's sleep if our room was higher up. Without having to say another word, the receptionist went out of her way already to secure a room away from the elevator. The room itself was a bit better than what you would expect for the price, too. It was clean, complementary water replaced daily, nothing went missing from the room and the AC was both effective and not noisy. One or two of the television stations seemed to have difficulties maintaining signal, but that wasn't a concern. Again, front desk staff were always helpful with answering questions, providing beach towels and assisting us by storing luggage for us until the evening during our last day so we didn't have to carry it around in the heat for the day until our cab in the evening to the airport. There's complimentary flavoured water in the lobby, a lovely restaurant called 'Heavenly' attached to the hotel as well.

If you’re trying to live it up Vegas style on the cheap, this is for you. Otherwise, spend the extra $100 and go up the the street to the Marriott or something. Finally, please please please think twice about bringing your children here.","Scottsdale, Arizona","mynotsohumbleopinion</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scottsdale, Arizona</strong>",3,2.0

The best things about this hotel are the location and Josh at reception. The hotel is situated just off the main strip and a very short walk to the beach, shops and restaurants. The discount store Ross is across from it for a quick shop of some incredible bargains. The shuttle to Waikele premium outlets is steps away near the T Galleria. The best coffee in Waikiki is a 3 minute walk to the Island Vintage company. Try the Acaii bowls and organic pesto chicken sandwich there too. Josh at reception is a star! He’s very helpful and always greets people with a smile. On my first trip last month I needed a late check-out and he very kindly accommodated us. On my second trip, I ducked out for a quick breakfast and when I got back he had finalised my bill and checked us out so I didn’t have to hang around waiting to have it done! That’s efficiency. Thank you Josh. Also really enjoyed the fruit infused water at reception. Thank you too for the welcome pack of Hawaiian snacks in the room. I booked thru Booking.com and was surprised that their rate didn’t include amenities fees etc so my bill was higher than I expected! Next time I will go direct and will hopefully give me a better idea of the costs. The negatives are the colours are too neon! The carpets in the corridor were fire engine red and when I got up at night to use the washroom I thought the hotel was on fire - the strip of light under the room door was glowing brightly red!! Although the hotel has been refurbished it’s still very old and tired. The cleaning too was substandard. I had to ask for my room to be cleaned when I got back one day at 3.30. The cleaners were doing the room across from ours when we left in the morning and must have just forgotten. I also saw a used floss-pick in the room.

It’s in a good location. Very central to all the shopping and restaurants in Waikiki. Just a short walk to the beach.It’s also right next door to a great cafe which you’ll find at the top of most “best breakfast” lists in the area. I can vouch that the food is delicious. The staff were nice. We turned up early and were slightly disappointed that they didn’t have our room ready early. But it was because they were holding us one of the larger rooms and it was still occupied. So, the staff are eager to turn negatives into positives.The hotel is well styled and the rooms are too. You can tell that they’re a little old and they’d benefit from a new lick of paint. But other than that, they’re great.Ammenities are adequate. There’s free coffee and water in the lobby all day. There’s a good lounge area. And there’s a nice roof top pool. Although, there’s no restaurant in the hotel unfortunately and I don’t believe they do room service.My one criticism is regarding the pool. When my partner and I went up there it was full of a family of children who were jumping, splashing and screaming at the top of their lungs. There was no space for anyone else to enjoy the water while they were in there. We thought the parents might calm them and ask them to share since we were up there, but they didn’t. It was pretty disappointing because we’d explicitly booked a smaller hotel outside of the major chains to avoid this exact issue - screaming, splashing children. My advice to the hotel would be to have noise policy for the pool area and enforce it. It was extremely disappointing that we were unable to enjoy the pool, despite paying for the use of it. We noticed one other couple come upstairs to enjoy the pool to but they left quickly after being repeatedly splashed by the children.

I stayed here two nights and wish I spent all 4 of my nights in Hawaii in this hotel. I heart you Shoreline forever. It's only like a 5 minute walk to the beach (you do have to cross a main street and walk through a bit of an outdoor mall area, but they often have live music and hula lessons, etc there so it's actually part of the amazing experience walking there). Once you get past the shopping zone you can sneak through the Sheraton pool area for the beach access, and smell the amazing Sheraton food (can go get some if you want) and it's just such a good little walk and really not very far from hotel to beach.... No dramas at all!In fact, you are really right next to several of the most iconic Waikiki hotels that you can just waltz into and enjoy their restaurants. I drank at the Royal Hawaiian's Mai Tai bar one night and had a lovely 5 min walk back home after listening to some live music and drinking pineapple and rum all night... While I was in the ocean one day I watch a hula show from The Royal Hawaiian's back lawn too. It's really right in the centre of everything. Also, the rooms are super cute and really clean. I also liked the way the lobby looked and they have water with fruit soaking in it to rehydrate with. I grabbed a glass every-time I went back to my room. The air conditioning worked amazingly... My view wasn't great, but I spent more time on the beach and enjoying the city than I did gazing out my window.... Bed was comfy too and no loud neighbours... I never ate at the cafe there because there was so much good food nearby, but it was nice to know it was there. Speaking of food, it's like 1 min walk from the Japanese food court (I do NOT recommend the ramen shop Baikohken in that food court there though. The one with the cherry tree in the middle of the table. Horrible experience there), but so many other amazing food options in that food court. Also, they have valet parking, which I was able to use once. The valet staff were all super friendly and proactive in trying to make sure you were taken care of and happy. It was so nice to have a place to drive up to and pick up your luggage/drop off.... Someone to turn on your air con in your car for you.... Amazing... And if you can't use the valet then you can park across the street in the Ross parking lot overnight. The lady told me that I will need to re-park at 7am, but actually you can stay and it will charge you $3 an hour every half hour up until you've spent a total of $35 for the day and then it will cap there (the cost of overnighting there is $25, so it really is only an extra $10 to park there the rest of the day)... Totally worth it not to have to re-park. They also give you beach towels so it was super easy to head down to the beach whenever I wanted.

The room was compact, but it had all the necessities. I would say that the room and bathroom were dirty, ie lots of scuffs on the wall, dirt in the grout, stains in the carpet, and the hallways and elevators smelled like dried vomit. The roof pool was small and didn’t have any lights at night so that was a no for me. The pros were the beverage selections in the lobby, nice welcome package, really great location, decent price. The bed was pretty comfy, too. I also overheard the staff a lot in the morning, especially in the morning of our departure. I’m pretty sure they were talking about us having the “do not disturb” sign up “again,” but that didn’t matter because they were very loud. They were speaking in another language (which I understood). They weren’t mean per se, just not very thoughtful. Other staff was generally nice, I’d argue the manager was the least friendly, but still okay. I was hoping this would be a good deal (slightly higher than average price with above average amenities) but it ended up being what I paid for - decent/slightly higher price, decent amenities. If I’m ever strapped for cash I’d stay here again, but otherwise I’d rather spend a tad more and stay somewhere else cleaner and a little more comfortable.

It's such a great property - this is horrible and unacceptable- customer service has a long way to go. They are so slow to respond, or just forget altogether, or don't pass the information to the next shift. the service is really not there.

She recommended it based on its low price and awesome location, relaxing vibe, and proximity to the beach. I was surprised at how nice the decor of the lobby was given the reasonable price point. The rooms are small and simple, but quite comfortable for our needs; after all, who is in Hawaii for the room? The rooms come with a small refrigerator; we were also easily able to request a microwave and an electric kettle, both free of charge- excellent. The highlight of our trip was the very impressive front desk agent, Josh. He is absolute dynamite, and made our stay absolutely incredible. I worked in hotel management as an operations director for 8 years, and I can say without a doubt, he is one of the best hotel representatives I've ever seen. He went way beyond what would be expected of him; he served as a concierge, providing us with awesome recommendations and local tips and tricks to make the most of our time. He also went out of his way to take special care of us specifically; we arrived several hours early for checkin; of course, I know the hotel policy of a 3pm checkin, and I didn't have any expectations that we'd be able to get in early. Without even asking for it, he approached us with no prompting whatsoever, and told us that he'd be able to get us a room almost 3 hours early. Absolutely amazing, right off the bat. I don't want to go into too much detail, but on several occasions, he went out of his way to make us feel uniquely welcome in a way I have never experienced as a customer of a hotel. He even wrote us a hand-written note welcoming us, and another one for our farewell. It was exceptionally touching. I feel like we really had a connection with him; he's a wonderful, kind-hearted, and thoughtful person.

I had lowered my expectations as I was aware that it was an old hotel that had been given a very nice modern paint job and for the price we were paying it would still have been a great deal.However they have lost a star from me because I can’t seem to justify their additional resort fee of $25 a night. This hotel is not a resort. On our 2 night stay the pool was closed for cleaning for one of the days (this is fine, pools need to be cleaned, but don’t tell me that the resort fee covers use of the pool and continue to charge me the full fee)If you don’t have a car, like us, then the resort fee isn’t going towards valet parking. Use of beach towels was a nice touch... but not for the price of the resort fee. And as I said I had been following on social media, we never received any of the welcome items that were described both when booking and as shown on their Instagram. I was actually really looking forward to trying the local snacks but they were never there.I understand that if your stay falls on a day where the hotel provides free events for guests this might justify the resort fee better however our 2 nights weren’t on these days.Overall I can gather that for our fee we received the use of beach towels for the pool for one use and a cup of watermelon flavoured water each for the grand price of $50I just want to make other travellers aware of this cost and perhaps the hotel could consider whether it really wants to claim to be a resort.Other issues included that the bed sheets and pillow cases had rips in them and housekeeping only made the bed and didn’t even replace the toilet roll and face tissues (which were already running very low on our arrival)Shoreline hotel have a great social media department, but really need to focus on the basics of what guests need and want from a hotel without the false promises.","London, United Kingdom","Keiraroo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",23,3.0

Staff members Josh and Joseph were excellent to deal with and always had a welcoming smile and friendly greeting. The complimentary drinks and snacks tray provided to each room upon arrival was greatly appreciated. One negative issue is that room air conditioning is not overly efficient and needs to be kept running for long periods to achieve a good comfort level. Rooms are serviced every day (by 4.00 pm at the latest) and we had no complaints.We will continue to stay at Shoreline during our regular visits to Oahu.,"Redhead, Australia","Robert P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redhead, Australia</strong>",7,4.0

I may have finally fallen asleep at 1:30 am. Then, because it's in the middle of Waikiki, there were loud sirens from police, ambulance, and/or fire trucks at 2 am, 3:30 am, and 4 am. Finally trash trucks came, making a ton of noise, starting at 5 am and continuing until about 6 am for all the neighboring buildings. The room had no soundproofing so it was like the ambulances and trash trucks were paying personal visits to your room.I've stayed in quite a few other hotels in Waikiki in the past, and never had any problems with noise.

It's a different ownership than the last visit. Nonetheless, all the same things remain. It's in a great central location close to all retail, restaurants and the beach. Still moderately priced and good value considering it's location. The staff, namely Josh and James, at the Front Desk are super hospitable and the Valet staff were always ready to help us with our car. Kudos to them for driving and parking skills because that driveway and alley way are really skinny! The biggest change for us here was the new decor and branding. Super cute and super 'Gram worthy if that's what you're looking for. So many cute things to take photos of from the lobby, to your hotel room and bathroom, and the rooftop pool. Note: the pool area is not a resort sized pool but great to lounge and lay out and definitely take cute backdrop photos. We spent most of our time at the beach so the pool size wasn't a huge deal. Their #naturemeetsneon hashtag perfectly coins their brand. There were times though that I walked into the lobby at night and had to squint a little and also wondered how the front desk staff could look at that all night because it was a bit too neon at night. But during the day, it's the most colorful lobby you'll find in Waikiki!I love all the amenities and activities they offer their guests. From the welcome snacks in your room, to the paint night, and the shave ice and snacks during the week, they make sure their guests feel the love. Island Vintage Coffee, Starbucks, International Marketplace, and Marukame Udon are a short walk away and Isayume Musubi is next door for quick snacks perfect for beaching. Everything you wanted to shop for is available close by, from high end to Ross which I might add had great souvenirs you can shop for, and has anything you need that you might have forgotten at home. The only reason it's not 5-stars was the dislodged lamp that was floating in the pool. It had a cable and we were concerned about electrocution! My DH called down to report it and it wasn't readily addressed. Also, valet parking is $30/night though that is comparable to other properties in the area. But overall, always a pleasant stay and a great home away from home when in Waikiki.","San Francisco, California","C2284SDannar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",5,4.0

The negatives that bring down the star rating are the lack of shade at the pool, the amenities and the house cleaning. You pay an amenity fee of approx 25 usd per day for amenities however all of the beach amenities are minimal and they all severely need replacing. We were 5 people with 3 rooms and yet every time we asked for a beach umbrella they either had none available or the one time we scored one it was broken and should have been thrown out a very long time ago. The beach chairs were well worn out and there were no eskies either.At the pool there was no shade so it was very rare to see people there during 12-5 and there was no bar at the pool. Also for some reason house cleaning tends to come at 4-5pm so after you’ve been outside for the day and are coming home to shower from the beach and change for dinner is when they want to clean your room!

The room itself was kind of small and kind of needed a paint touch-up, but the bed was nice and the layout was good. The view was of the building across the way which had a lot of garbage on it's balcony, so I didn't spend much time on my balcony, but that was fine as I had not paid for any sort of view. Heavenly is such a great restaurant and it was awesome to get a discount for staying at the hotel. The infused water was a nice touch, and the different things that had going on in the lobby on some days (like shave ice and popcorn) was delightful. The location of this hotel is also ideal because it's by good shopping, great restaurants, and it's not far from the beach. The rooftop pool was usually pretty empty which made it wonderful as it takes up most of the roof and there's not really room for groups, but it's ideal for two people who want to lounge and swim.

Those aren't for us and I didn't go to Hawaii to waste any time on that sort of thing. I told Josh at the front desk, one of the things I liked about the Shoreline was the fact it was not a timeshare hotel! What we got was a nice room and bath that took care of all our needs for the week at a very reasonable cost. As we were constantly on the go all we needed was a place to sleep and clean up and this place was just the ticket. They have a great little pool on the roof, but we never got to use it. We did take advantage of the complimentary drinks in the lobby and one day they were handing out popcorn and flavored shaved ice. Parking was $30 a day which was less than anywhere else in the area and of course it was valet as parking is scarce in Waikiki. I never once had an issue leaving the vehicle or getting it delivered. This hotel had a little cafe next door, but we went around the corner to McDonald's or a block further to IHop a few mornings. And it is only a few blocks from the beach. Several restaurants are within a few blocks like Yard House, Hard Rock and Dukes. And my wife loved going to the International Market Place, a mall less than a 10 minute walk from the hotel.

From the pictures we were picturing a some what modern hotel but for the most part it is quite dated. They updated a few things in the room but the room is still pretty old, especially the bathroom, which I think was not updated at all.We were debating between this hotel and surf jack and opted for this one as it is slightly cheaper.

As locals, we love supporting boutique hotels instead of staying at the bigger resorts. Upon arrival, their valet was full (they only have like 15 stalls in their underground garage). I went to the front desk while my fiance waited in the car. The receptionist told me to park across the street in the Hyatt Centric's parking garage or find street parking elsewhere. Street parking in Waikiki, are you serious?! We ended up parking our car in the Hyatt's parking garage.The valet told my fiance to check back with the front desk later that night to see if/when parking would become available, which is fine for us. Later that night after returning from dinner, a stall opened up and we moved our car and they did not charge us extra for parking that night. Which was appreciated!The pictures on their website are a bit deceiving, it makes the rooms look a lot more spacious and the pool looks a lot bigger, but was a bit of a disappointment in person. The prices suit the size of the rooms. The bathroom is tiny! We were in a King Suite, I don't know if all the bathrooms in the hotel are the same size, but I expected a little bigger since we were in a larger room. Also, we didn't have a balcony.. We were on the 13th floor (2nd from the top) when we looked down, all the floors below us had balconies. We still had sliding doors to let fresh air in, just no balcony. It was a little weird. Amenities like the fresh fruit infused waters, tea and coffee in their lobby was nice. The welcome basket with a 2-night stay is a nice touch (but we didn't get one upon check-in, so I had to mention it the next day to the receptionist on our way out for lunch; they provided one promptly). We invited some family over to swim in the pool with us, and without hesitation the front desk gave us pool towels for everyone. It was nice to have the pool to ourselves. but like I mentioned previously, its pretty small, I can't imagine how cramped it must be with more than 10 people up there. The pool ladder needs to be bolted down better, it was a bit rickety. Also, there wasn't a bathroom or any other amenities up there, so you'd need to head back to your room. Overall, it's a good price if you're not too picky about the size of the room/bathroom. The bed/pillows were comfy, the tv and a/c work, and the walls seemed thick, so we slept soundly. The decor is cute which makes for great pics. The location is good, its nearby a lot of shops/eateries; right across the street from Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center and a block down from International Market Place and not too far from the beach or Ala Moana.","Ewa Beach, Hawaii","savedaprincess</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ewa Beach, Hawaii</strong>",0,3.0

Well, the lobby is really the only good thing about this hotel. The infused water, changing color lights at night, and overall look is very cute. Going from there... everything else was a total bummer. The rooms were tiny and very lackluster compared to what I was expecting, it reminded me of a college dorm room decorated with just a couple items. I was shocked on how plain the rooms were compared to the look of the lobby. The air conditioning worked, that may be my only positive about the room. I didn’t take a shower and the bed was just ok. The lighting was even kind of strange. Hotel was super noisy and the hallways seemed dark and dirty. The carpet outside of the elevator was very stained (red stains). Now, let’s talk view... there is none. Looking outside my room was laughable actually. I looked down onto trash and whatever else spills out from the restaurant next door. The building next to this hotel needs to be demolished honestly. I would have rather had a fake picture of Hawaii instead of a window.  The pool was closed, so never saw that. They suggested a sister locations’ pool, which was advertised as heated and guess what! The heater was broken. At this point I am so not shocked. I paid close to $300 for a nights stay here, I did book day of which may of had something to do with it. I could have booked (much nicer) hotels in the area for much cheaper. If I had paid $150 tops (and that’s even being generous) for this room I wouldn’t be this pissed off. It still makes me cringe thinking about this whole experience.  The staff was nice, but I really didn’t interact with them too much. They do hold your luggage for you before check in. I did like that.  Apparently I was supposed to get a necklace and some snacks upon arrival, but I never got that. I did get a reply on one of my other reviews saying they had plenty of other amenities to offer. Well, I’m maybe blaming the staff for not mentioning any of that? Yeah the water in the lobby and towels for the beach, cool. That should be standard in every “3 star” hotel. So that was a joke.  So all in all I paid double what I should have for a college dorm room I could have decorated better myself. With a closed pool and a broken pool. The only amenities are towels and water/coffee. Oh and I read someone else’s review saying the breakfast was granola bars and muffins. I can go to an ABC store for that.

The only good thing they have is location. We stayed here from the 2nd to the 12th, we had 3 adults and 1 child aged one and a half. The largest room they have is not suitable for families. When I asked if they could do something to help me, I was pretty much told NO as I did not book straight through the hotel. The point of this is to let people know the photos are not what they seem. We could only walk down the middle of the beds not the sides as there is not enough room. My son couldn’t fit in the crib/cot that they have it’s too small. The pool area is tiny and not even a place that you can just go relax. We tried to stay out of our room as much as possible and even found sitting in the lobby some what better. We also found the reception staff not very full of information and often asked other people for help.

Missed ""first impressions"" opportunity? (I have to disclose here that I am an ex-front of house hotel manager, which may render my review bias?)I love the flavoured chilled water station, I used my own bottle, in lieu of the single use plastic cups. (why not provide some of the colourful reusable cups you have in the rooms?) I liked very much the colourful and comfortable lobby chairs, I gladly sat near the oversized fan, and flicked through the Gray Marlin photography book I found on the coffee table.I arrived early and was okay to leave my bag, the male receptionist was pleasant enough, but not overly memorable. I would have liked to have been sent a text to let me know when my room was ready? - a nice service touch? I also was not offered any neighbourhood advice, nor was I told about the hotel's facilities. I would have liked to have changed and gone to the beach, but was unsure if there was a change area close by? I gladly otherwise spent the day exploring the area. Upon my return around 3:00 pm, I was greeted so warmly by Venus. I mention her name, because she was really warm and friendly. The hotel manger needs to know this. Venus even relocated me to a quieter room with no concern. I am such an advocate that a genuine and engaged employee experience definitely makes all the difference in a hotel stay, no matter how comfortable a bed is, how instagrammable the hotel is, or how well priced. The room was delightfully simple, clean, with kitsch colours everywhere. I found everything I needed really easily. My bed was indeed comfortable, and despite being a ""standard"" room - was practical and met my needs. The bathroom was really clean too. Check out was straight forward - Venus was on shift again and gladly helped me mailing a postcard, call me a taxi and sent me off with a warm farewell.","Sydney, Australia","callaneade</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",7,5.0

The noises both inside the hotel and outside the hotel were also very loud and annoying when we were trying to sleep; they should really sound-proof their walls.

There is a rooftop pool but there is very little space to walk around up there between the edges of the pool and the side of the building, which I find to be rather dangerous. The pictures online make it look bigger than it is. There is also no hot tub and the compressors by the pool are very loud and distracting. To access the pool, you need to take the elevator to the 14th floor and then climb the last set of stairs, then there are more stairs once you're the roof. I found the setup very unappealing. The rooms themselves are cute when you're inside and the staff was very friendly, but between the noise and other things I've mentioned I was rather disappointed with my stay here.

The facilities were great, I loved the little welcoming touches of flavoured water & tea in the lobby, to the welcome pack in my room. There were lots of cool, instagram worthy spots especially the foyer and pool area. It was always nice to have a relaxing spot to come back to at the end of the day, with friendly staff always in the lobby to welcome you. The only negative things I would have to say is that the ceiling in my bathroom had dirty marks on it and the noise from the bar down the street was really loud at night, especially since my room faced that way - ear plugs were left in my room for me which worked well, but it's just something to be aware of.

The bright colors and décor were just begging to be photographed.As an almost senior citizen, I felt I should seem younger & cooler just by staying there. However, it lacked too many practicalities to keep the my latent hipster from prevailing over my grouchy old lady. While it certainly was an eye-catching place the photogenic aspects couldn't make up for the lack of practical amenities one expects from a hotel room. For example, other than the small bedside nightstands there were NO DRAWERS in the room, so guests must either stack their clothes on the lone closet shelf or live out of their suitcases for the duration of their stay. The walls are thin and soundproofing poor, so despite being on a high floor, we could hear street noises: shouts of partying vacationers, trucks backing up, garbage cans clanging, etc., throughout the night. Housekeeping starts late in the morning, and the first full day of our stay our room was never even cleaned, despite our being out shopping or at the beach for extended periods during the morning and afternoon.The hotel is conveniently located in central Waikiki. Nice views from the small rooftop pool. The unheated water is refreshing.The front desk people were pleasant, polite, and eager to be of service.We appreciated the infused waters, coffee, and tea available in the lobby. Unfortunately, our stay did not coincide with 'Pau Hana' days so we were unable to sample the treats offered then. However, we did enjoy the tray of goodies in our room as well as the bottles of water, (which saved us a trip down to the lobby when we got thirsty in the middle of the night). We enjoyed the substantial and healthy breakfasts at the Heavenly Café, but hope more items will be offered in the future. I would like to have tried one of the smoothies or acai bowls, but they were not part of the included breakfast. It's also too bad that it cost an extra $5.00 to order coffee in the café as we found out our first morning there. (Who doesn't include coffee with breakfast)? On subsequent mornings we brought coffee from the hotel lobby into the restaurant.In summary, while I'm not so advanced in age that I cannot appreciate the cool, photogenic aspects and amenities of the Shoreline, I'm also pragmatic enough to expect a quiet room with adequate storage that gets cleaned daily.","Alameda, California","marihime</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alameda, California</strong>",8,3.0

The nightstands on each side of the bed both had power outlets--excellent for two people charging phones and devices at beside! The room had a coffeemaker & mini-fridge, and the closet had a hairdryer, iron, and ironing board. Our room had a balcony, which was a nice addition but wasn't very relaxing, as it overlooked a carpark and other hotel rooms.The bathroom had a shower/tub combo that was free of mold--good job, housekeeping! There was ample counter space, which was great for setting out toiletries during a longer stay. The towels were nice and absorbent.

The decor is truly fabulous. HOWEVER, there is no drip coffee maker or microwave in the rooms - just a hot water jug (and you have to hunt to find a plug for it. Mine ended up on the bedside table). And some very stingy tubes of what is euphemisticallly entitled 'freeze dried Kona coffee' - which means INSTANT COFFEE. And it's undrinkable. The lack of microwave meant I couldn't curl up with a good movie and relax if I didn't feel like going out to a restaurant - so I ended up at the local ABC store for store bought sushi two nights in a row. The air conditioning is either freeze or fry. It's cold, turns off, and you have to endure the hot & stuffy atmosphere before it kicks in again. And when it does kick in, it's really noisy. The rooms aren't insulated well from outside city noises - but hey, you're in Waikiki, so that was not unexpected. The lovely presentation of fruit, fruit water and coffee in the lobby was really nice (and appreciated) - though again, the quality of the coffee wasn't great. Sorry to sound like a coffee snob. I'm not. But you could definitely do better in the comfort arena, Shoreline - eg your bed pillows were hard.

My first was in 2013, second in 2017, and now it’s 2018, my third. I see the renovated decoration which is totally different from previous ones and the color is really strong and eye catching. I like the color of the old ones better as they brought sense of calm and peace in my opinion. Second, they do not provide beach umbrellas at the front desk anymore. And interestingly, the GM letter in each room still mentions about beach umbrella, beach chair and beach towels but the documents in key pocket mention only mentions beach chair and towels. It’s not consistent. Third, the service I experienced with the reservation email is “not responding” at all. How cool is that? But apparently it fits the new renovated decoration style - cool! And also the conversation we had with the gentleman in the front desk, no smiling at his face at all, how cool is that! While we asked him about beach unbrella he just told “no we don’t provide that anymore”. I know there has been changed of management in Shoreline but I see only the upgrade and improvement of hardware (decoration and the dressing style of the staffs are colorful). Anyway I am sure the new style with beautiful trendy decoration can still attract a lot of people but sadly it’s not my nor my husband’s choice anymore.

If you have any sort of standard regarding the quality of your living area this place is not for you.We booked this hotel very last minute after we found out about the strike affecting other properties in Honolulu just a day or two before we were to arrive in HNL. Our original hotel (Royal Hawaiian) was part of the strike and the availability surrounding Thanksgiving was sorely limited. There are so many things wrong with this hotel that I think the only way to address the problems in a concise manner is to use bullets. We were also charged a $25/night ""resort fee"" which to the best of knowledge paid for fruity tap water in the lobby and nothing else. This hotel is so far from a resort it is comical they can even legally charge that. it should be fraud.1. The actual hotel and the photos online are shockingly different. a. The lobby is totally renovated but nothing else is as far as I could tell. b. The pool is laughingly small.c. The ""balcony"" they boast for each room is only large enough to fit a single plastic chair.d. There is no ""view"" at this hotel. It is right in the middle of Waikiki and buildings and trash and smells. You can sort of see part of a mountain, if you squint.2. The hotel is not only not remodeled but it is in disrepair. a. The carpet in the rooms was threadbare. b. The bedding was scratchy and dingy.c. The towels were terrible,d. The toiletries were what I think they probably sell in prison commissaries.e. Barely any furnishings in the room.f. Elevator is the slowest thing possible. g. The AC in the hotel and the rooms basically do not work at all to the point that they have large commercial fans in the lobby. Not an ideal situation. I was sticky and cranky the entire time we stayed here. 3. Smells! a. Our room smelled old and moldy except when we dared to open the door and the food smells from the fast food Asian restaurants below overpowered the mold smell. 4. Sounds! a. Absolutely no sound proofing in this hotel. In room you can hear every word being said in the hallway. Every siren and loud motorcycle on the street (even 14 floors up).5. The staff! Whew, they were a real treat... NOTa. No offer of assistance with bagsb. No attempt made to greet guests exiting or returning to the hotelc. No interaction with guests at all unless forced (that I could tell)d. My husband locked his wallet in our room with his key and ID and they refused to open the door to allow him in. He had to call me to return from the shops and wait for half an hour to be allowed in.e. When we were checking out we needed to have them hold our bags for an hour or so. It was a complete and utter clusterf^&*. The gentleman working ignored us for close to 10 minutes. Then just advised we leave the bags sitting in the floor without any confirmation of the hotel taking responsibility for them. When he asked what time we planned to return he advised that was a really inconvenient time for the hotel... so we showed up early and the entire lobby was empty. He was arranging hats on the wall and ignored me again for close to 15 minutes. I have never been treated so poorly. All this is to say if you have any choice at all please do not choose Shoreline Hotel Waikiki.","Dallas, Texas","MrsssHH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",26,1.0

This hotel is terribly understaffed...so you know what that means??? A lot of WAITING. The whole reason I chose to book here was because of the new hip & modern facelift that's been advertised throughout social media.This place may look like a great place to capture pictures, but If you are looking for excellent guest services...look elsewhere! The level of guest service here is extremely terrible. Never have I experienced such poor guest services until I stayed here for my friend's wedding during the weekend of September 7th-9th.When I arrived to the small cramped Valet parking lot, I was not once welcomed or greeted at all. Never once offered any assistance. That is truly NOT a great first impression upon arrival, or a great welcoming to arriving guests. Only ONE person working Valet, and he must've been having a bad day...or clearly HATES doing his job. It's obvious, and shows in the mannerisms and facial expressions he displayed.The front desk agent who checked me in was probably the ONLY excellent service I encountered while staying here. Upon check in, the lobby was crowded, and there was a line of guests waiting. Only 2 agents working at the time. I appreciated the fact that the gentleman who checked me in was able to get me a ready room before the standard check in time.During my second day at the resort, I came down to Valet to get my parked vehicle. This is where everything went downhill. Once again, it seemed the male working at Valet was not having a great day. After handing him my Valet ticket, he handed me my own keys and made me move my own vehicle just so he could move cars blocking mine. When do Valet make a guest move their own vehicle? The parking lot is already extremely tight & small to begin with, and I'm stuck moving own vehicle because this place is understaffed with only ONE person working!? Unbelievable! This resulted in me damaging my own vehicle. Even after my car was damaged, Valet did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to assist.SAFETY at this hotel seems to be the least of their concern here. Safety should be the FIRST priority to guests! Valet parks your car under a tent held down by bricks. Per management Jordan, I was told these bricks are ""safe"" and are used to secure the tent, and are also used for guest activities. Really? Not ONCE throughout my stay did I see any guest activities happening under the tent they park cars under. They don't realize that these bricks can potentially hurt or trip guests, or WORST...damage your vehicle! Besides Valet, the pool area is also dangerous. Don't let the pretty pictures of the floral mural fool you! The metal steps to enter the deep end of the pool is extremely loose, and sounds like it will fall off when you are entering. Communication with management is extremely poor here. They seem to take pride in avoiding & dodging their guests. Nobody knows what to do in tough situations. All the managers I have spoken to (Chris & Jordan) NEVER have a transparent answer for my issues. After the incident that happened to my vehicle, there was no compassion or sympathy from anyone I spoke with. No compensation or even a formal apology was given. Management seems to always be busy & NEVER available when I would reach out to them. They lack following up with you in a timely manner, and only respond via email when it's most convenient for them.. I would ALWAYS be the one to reach out to them for a follow up. NOBODY reached out to me as I requested. As a guest, I felt like all fingers were being pointed at me for their poor guest service. I still have yet to hear from the General Manager Alvida who I requested to speak with. Still no follow up..still WAITING!Overall, may this review be a lesson to those looking to stay here. Will I ever stay here again? Absolutely NOT!","Waianae, Hawaii","nosnorb808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waianae, Hawaii</strong>",0,1.0

Venus (Front Desk) was particularly a standout as she was informative, smiles, is welcoming. Free fruit water (I loved the flavours) and coffee in the lobby. Cool chairs and relaxing area for when you want to sit and plan the day. There aren’t too many rooms so the hallways, lobby and lift is never busy or over crowded. I loved that about my stay.

You can also hear people in the room next to you if they shout or speak loudly but luckily we had great neighbours. Reason I didn’t give a 5:-bed was too soft and pillows too soft that I couldn’t get a decent nights sleep- the white bedsheets (which are changed regularly, so no problems there) were stained in some places- towels smelt like bleach sometimes- smelt a bit like an old hotel (just a tad)",,355nus,3,4.0

After a long day out ( left each morning by just after 9 am and retuned by 2.30 pm at the earliest ) it would be nice to return to a serviced room . Air conditioning not explained , found out day before last when housekeeping left a room corner in the socket. Pool was very disappointing, only a very narrow area around the pool and as it was on roof , it felt rather unsafe . Having looked around Waikiki, we could have found better at a similar price . Lobby will look nice when work is finished .Replies to reviews are all similar, so if we should come back to Waikiki, we would stay somewhere else .",surrey,"notmyname08</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>surrey</strong>",21,2.0

Bathroom, bright and cheerful with pristine white towels, toiletries environmentally friendly. The roof top swimming pool does require you to climb a flight of stairs, a local artist painted the stairs and around the pool and what an amazing job he did it was a joy just experiencing that, the pool was very clean and of good size.The hotel staff Naoki, Chris and Sonny were welcoming, friendly and very helpful when checking in Naoki noticed my partner John would be celebrating his 70th birthday and on the day sent a bottle of wine to our room, how thoughtful and a lovely gesture.

The hotel agreed to hold our luggage till then but then wanted a tip for taking our bags to our room. The air con did not work and when my husband went to reception to ask why he was told to put the room card into the light switch (the lights were already working without the card). When he asked why we had not been told this on check in he was told that the receptionist was new and did not realise. There was coffee in the room but no milk. You got the first cup free then had to pay if you wanted more. Our city view room looked out onto a slum like apartment building which was only a driveway away from our balcony. The bathroom wallpaper was peeling off revealing mildew. The toilet ran water all night. There was no sound proofing of any kind so we heard every sound from the street as well as from every room on our floor. On our first full day in the hotel we returned from an outing only to find our room cards had been deactivated. Not a very pleasant experience at all considering the amount we paid for our room.

We had an early arrival and requested an early check in (for a fee) which can’t be guaranteed until you arrive and see what’s available. We were lucky we had a room available from 11am. In the meantime we were offered beach chairs and towels and our bags were taken care of by reception.The first thing we noted on arrival is access to the lobby is via a set of stairs and there isn’t any porters to assist you when you arrive so don’t expect a grand entry.The hotel is in prime location to everything in the heart of Waikiki. Walk less than 100 metres and you’re on the main strip where there’s lots of restaurants and some shopping - if you’re looking for expensive luxury brands that is!The free breakfast mentioned is just some free packaged snacks more so and only available between 7am - 9am in the lobby. The snacks were the same daily, muffins, waffles, chew bars and muesli bars. Definitely appreciated but as snacks. We tried the flavoured waters and didn’t like any of them - these are also the same daily.We ate breakfast at Island Vintage coffee at the Royal Hawaiian centre daily which is a short walk away.The bed was clean upon check in but I wouldn’t say the room overall was and definitely showed signs of needing some repairs especially to the cupboard doors and fridge area. Bathrooms really do need an upgrade! There was only one single chair on the balcony which was all rusted and didn’t look inviting at all. We found that our room was never made up whilst we were out and house keeping was always late late afternoon around 4pm.The pool is tiny with barely any lounge chairs and it really isn’t inviting... we went there once and there was a newspaper at the bottom of the pool that looked like it was there all day so clearly not a maintained area. Highly recommend taking use of the complimentary chairs and towels and heading down to the beach. The chairs though are very worn! Something to keep in mind.The hotel has no security in terms of swipe access to get to levels or pool. Anyone can walk in and get into the lift and go up to any floor and even use the pool! There’s a lot who have mentioned the outside noise in reviews, honestly the noise we found to be all inside the hotel! House keeping staff noisy, lifts noisy and doors noisy. The most disappointing thing for us was one afternoon we asked a lady working at reception to assist us with booking a tour. We had all the information and explained we needed help with calling etc and she was very uncomfortable and visibly nervous doing this and seemed very incompetent. We ended up having to cross the road and get another hotel to assist us with ease.Overall if you’re looking to save a bit of money especially with waikiki’s high accomodation prices and still want to be in a good location, Shoreline would suffice BUT if you’re used to staying at known, well kept hotels... you will be very disappointed here and highly recommend spending the extra to stay elsewhere.","Melbourne, Australia","H8Flying94</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",10,3.0

The negatives: the room was very small (not sure how other Honolulu hotel rooms compare but this was NYC hotel room small; no dresser to unpack a bit while there), poor maid service (3 days the maid didn't come until after 3:00 PM. We'd go to the beach, or go out for the day, and want to come back mid afternoon to grab a shower but couldn't because there had been no maid service and no fresh towels), run down rooms (electric plug in the bathroom didn't work, mold, peeling wall paper, etc.)There is a small pool on the roof which is fine but who spends time in a pool with Waikiki Beach 2 minutes walk away. There is no gym and no business centre to print boarding passes but if you email to the front desk, they can print them off for you. The location is in a very busy, noisy part of Waikiki bit the noise didn't bother us one little bit. There is a Ross Dress for Less across the street and what looks like an all but abandoned building next door. If you are looking for a budget hotel and don't mind a small room with some issues, then this might be an okay choice. I think if we ever go back, I'll spend the extra money and stay at a better hotel.","Halifax, Canada","tshep42</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Halifax, Canada</strong>",430,2.0

The double glazed window was permanently misty, so was obviously broken, and the little balcony did not look at all appealing. Air conditioning was noisy.

You'll hear garbage trucks and other noises very early in the morning. The space is very small for the price. Not quite I imagined it as seen in the photos.

They knew my name by the 2nd day. The hotel isn't on the beach but about 5 minute walk from anywhere in Waikiki you want to be. Based on the price I was afraid the room wouldn't be clean, but everything in the room from the carpet, bed linens, to the bathroom were spotless each day. I had originally booked 5 days but after the first day I cancelled my ""luxury"" hotel reservation for twice the price and booked another stay at the Shoreline. All the other guests at the wedding were jealous I had found such an affordable yet comfortable hotel to stay in a central location. My only complaint is that the TV system is a little weird to navigate. I like some white noise while I sleep and I ended up finding 50 channels of infomercials.

The rooms looked recently renovated and contemporary and were nicely appointed with a comfy bed and linens. The staff was very attentive and offered some great amenities. We were personally contacted by the concierge via email prior to our stay. My husband replied and mentioned we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. As a result, we not only received a free upgrade to a lovely corner room on the top floor overlooking the city with views of the mountains and the water, but also a complementary bottle of wine complete with wineglasses in our room upon arrival. This hotel was a quick block walk to the beach and centrally located. Our pearl harbor tour (with Polynesian Adventure Tours which we recommend as well) picked us up and returned us right across the street. The Shoreline also offered free use of beach chairs, towels, etc. We wish we could have stayed here longer before hopping to the next island. Since we are not big breakfast eaters, we really appreciated the grab and go breakfast bars, muffins, etc. as well as the wonderfully infused water all day long. Finally we opted for the Diamond Head Luau due to its proximity. It was great to be able to walk to it and not spend an hour or so on a bus in traffic getting to and from the other luaus, most of which are some distance from Waikiki. Diamond Head was about a mile away and a very easy walk along the beautiful waterfront park. We had planned to take a cab back but ended up walking since it was such a nice walk and felt perfectly safe as many people were out and about and stores and restaurants were open along the way, which was very well lit. Try the restaurant next door (actually you can enter it through door from the hotel's lobby. The food was great and they were more than happy to box us up to go lunches to eat at the airport before our flight. While I believe the hotel does offer transportation from the hotel to the airport we opted to take a lyft or uber.

If you are looking for an oceanfront resort, this is not the hotel for you. It is very centrally located, so you can easily access the beach, restaurants, and shopping. For what it lacks in size, it makes up for in amenities. Beach chairs and towels are available for the short walk to the beach. The pool upstairs is cute and not crowded. The staff is so friendly and helpful! They gave me some excellent recommendations for restaurants and were super helpful any time I needed anything. I love the little breakfast bar and snacks.

We stayed for 10 nights and arrived super early, our room was not ready but Matt was kind enough to check us into a room to get our sleep with our 2.5 year old.

Literally 10 steps from Ross, ABC convenience store and all transportation for tours or trolley rides. Great and generous coffee varieties in our room (including French), bountiful options of luxurious pillows to get a good night sleep. Well-cleaned and well-attended room. We felt like no request was out of the question from band aids to scales to universal adaptors-staff are very attentive, friendly and helpful. Leave your beach towels at home as the Hotel offers you a supply at front desk (no charge). Free and HQ wi-fi. All hours of the night and day you have a refreshing supply of detox water and fun fruit flavoured drinks, hot tea and coffee which were great when we were on the go, cute surprises of fairy floss and trail mixes made an appearance on my stay too.

We didn't really know where to park, because we didn't know it was valet only. We managed to pull up and ask someone on the street if self-parking was available. They said it was valet only, so we proceeded up the ramp to valet parking. The valet attendant immediately welcomed us and took our bags. He directed us to the front desk where we were warmly greeted and checked in. We were told to go ahead and head up to our room and our bags would be sent up. As soon as we got to our room, our bags were already right behind us. Great service! Upon initial inspection of the room, we agreed that it was a tad small and the walkout balcony was also smaller than we would have liked. Also, there weren't any dressers to put our clothes in, but there was a closet to hang clothes. We were dismayed, but said we were just going to go with the flow and make the best of our vacation. (By the way, the room was immaculately clean and neat!) As our week progressed, we quickly realized that not only were we right at the heart of everything: shops, restaurants, stores, etc., the hotel staff was amazing! I highly recommend Shoreline Hotel Waikiki and will definitely stay there again next time! One more note: JORDAN CESNEROS, Senior Guest Experience Manager, emailed me before our trip and asked if there was anything he could do to make our stay more enjoyable. I told him it was my wife's birthday on the 22nd and that morning, they wrote a personalized Happy Birthday note on the hotel lobby chalkboard! Can you say brownie points for me????

It was roughly a 5 minute walk to get to the beach and was very close to several shopping centers. The staff was always incredibly friendly and pleasant to deal with.The resort fee presumably covered the beach towels, chairs, and umbrellas on loan, flavored drinks / coffee / tea in the lobby, cotton candy between 3 and 4 pm, and Granola Bars / Muffins in the morning. We grabbed some of the latter for the road on early mornings when we were going out hiking and it really helped us save some $ and time!The room was sufficiently nice with relatively quiet air conditioning and a small baclony. The bathroom could probably use a little updating, but it was totally acceptable for the price. Otherwise the room was nice, but nothing that will blow you away. The pool was nothing remarkable either but who cares when you're that close to such a nice beach. If I were planning the trip again knowing what I know now, I'd definitely be up for staying here again.",,RyanG3748,0,5.0

The hotel does not have a restaurant but has a deal with the adjacent restaurant (Heavenly) where hotel guests can get 10% discount. We used it for breakfast a couple of times and it was excellent. Towels were changed daily (without asking) and bed linen every three days.Despite previous comments about noise we didn't have a problem but would recommend probably trying for a room on one of the upper floors.

When confronted with a complementary WiFi and coffee cards, she stammered something about these being complementary within the 15.71 dollar fee. At that point I wanted my money back. She finally presented a booking (made by my travel agency) that satisfactorily explained it as some Hawaian hotel fee or tax. Maybe the hotel should train their receptionists little better in order not to give lame explanations. Otherwise the hotel is close to Waikiki beach and reasonably priced.",,Jerry N,0,3.0

I absolutely loved our stay! This boutique is so adorable with such chic modern furniture in the lobby. There is complimentary infused water, coffee, tea, an essentials oil bar, and they give you free towels to borrow for the beach. It's not a beach front property, but the beach is very close, a short walk, and its within steps of many restaurants and shopping centers. Its located right next to Waikiki Shopping Plaza, which has a cute Japanese eatery, also right across from Royal Hawaiian Center, which has lots of different shops and eateries as well. Its in the heart of Waikiki, so its surrounded by pretty much everything! The bed was comfortable and the room was cute. Everything was clean and well done. The front desk service was really nice and helpful. The front desk guy gave me some recommendations on food places he liked -- but ask me for mine! :D There is a pool, but I would recommend just going to the beach since its so close by. I didn't find the room to be too small as some of the reviews had mentioned, but honestly when you are in the heart of everything, we spent so much time walking everywhere around Waikiki and enjoying the beach. This is a very cute and comfortable hotel to come back to after a day of exploring at a great price point. Location is perfect here, rooms are comfortable, cute hotel overall!

We have previously stayed right on the beach but wanted somewhere more reasonably priced for our short break. We were on the early flight from OZ and had requested early check-in. When we arrived there were no rooms available so we left our bags and went for a walk. The staff on check-in were very friendly and that continued through-out our stay.We returned a few hours later and were provided a room on the 8th floor. The room was clean with comfy bed, mini fridge and mircrowave. Overall the facilities exceeded my expectations and the WiFi speed were very good.Our view faced the dreaded building that others have complained about, but lets face it, the hotel can't control the neighbours and apart from sleeping in the room, we had't gone there for the view. The location was ideal, right on the door step of ""Ross"" and just around the corner from the upgraded international market and a Nordstrom-rack, a few blocks to the beach and plenty of good restaurants and bars to try near by (the hotel supply great beach towels)The hotel itself does not have its own bar so if you are in a group, there isn't really a place to meet apart from reception. When we go in a group, we normally meet in the hotel bar before venturing out.I'd read reviews about noise from the street and have to say that on one night a car alarm was going off nearby which woke us but apart from that there was no issues at all.We did use the roof top pool on one occasion, not the most salubrious but did the job.Suffice to say, when I go back to Waikiki with just my wife, we will stay here again.",Brisbane,"Paul T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane</strong>",58,4.0

NEED further training. When faced with a challenge that was easily solvable with good / basic customer service during check in - a card not going through for authorisation for 'incidentals' following total and complete payment in full for the room. Instead of allowing the 'customer' to go up to their room to find the appropriate card in their luggage after stressful travelling. The front desk staff refused to allow the 'customer' to have the keys to their room without a card or a $200 cash deposit - despite the room already being paid for in full. They held the 'customer' hostage in the lobby untill a card could be found or a large cash deposit paid - even asking them to unpack their luggage in the lobby to find said card, before they were allowed access to their room. Claiming this was 'policy'. This was hostile, unecessary and showed a huge lack of understanding of the customer experience. Favoring unquestioned 'policy' over keeping the customer feeling happy, positive and their situation understood - when such an easy resolution was within their grasp. No customer recovery was attempted and the 'customer' decided to walk out without checking in. Such a blatant failure to deal with a few very common customer challenges.

The 'bar' is a bar called 'Heavenly' - great name for a bar!! It is attached to the hotel and caters from the street so can get very busy for breakfasts!In essence - great hotel, great value and great staff!!

Bit of a pet peeve about staying in hotels.

The location of this accommodation cannot be beat. It is close to everything. Unfortunately the location was all that impressed us. Firstly the accommodation had decided to impose a $15 a night 'resort' fee which began in July. I always book with booking.com so that I know the total price before booking but there was no information about this. Also in the weeks leading up to our stay the Shoreline didn't contact us to let us know about the fee. They just said we've implement this today and you have to pay. The fee is for wifi, towels, tea, coffee and a 200ml water per guest. All of which I am used to being included for free. My next complaint is that I asked for a quiet room if possible as I am in my third trimester of pregnancy. They put us in a room next to the elevator that could be heard all night. I should of a asked to be moved once we arrived but I thought I might not be able to hear it. I was wrong!! On top of the noise of the elevator the outside noise IS SO LOUD!!! This may just be Honolulu but we really struggled to sleep. Lastly the air con was hopeless. It didn't let out any cold air. We only had a short stay and we had to leave at 4am to fly home so weren't able to make management aware of our disappointments. I suggest if booking this hotel, pack earplugs, make sure the air con works and check what fees you will have to pay on arrival.

When I chose this Hotel, I had read many reviews (which were mostly positive), but still was unsure as I had never been to Hawaii. From the moment I arrived, everyone there was extremely courteous and helpful. In many ways they went above and beyond, often times doing the little things that they don't have to do. For a smaller Hotel, it's in great shape. You are within walking distance from most of Waikiki, as it's only a little over a block from Waikiki Beach! They have NO resort fees, which is very unusual for Waikiki. They do have a charge (like most hotels in Waikiki) for parking (valet only). But I was conveniently billed at the end of my stay. The decor of the room was different, and something I liked. Now the room was fairly small, as was the balcony. But I didn't mind that at all. Although most of their rooms have mini-fridges, if you want one, it's best to ask them (like I did), to help ensure you get a room with one. There is also a rooftop pool, with a great view of the area, and a partial ocean view! Overall, I highly recommend The Shoreline.

Everything is within walking distance e.g. the beach, shops, restaurants. Hotel staff are very helpful and pleasant. The hotel was recently renovated, so the rooms are quite clean and comfortable. There are in-room safes, Keurig coffee makers, plus all the normal amenities you would expect with any hotel these days. The free Wi-Fi is also pretty strong.If you have a car, you can park across the street at a reduced rate (24 USD per day, which is good for the area). Shuttles for the airport or for various tour companies pick up right in front of the hotel.While the hotel does not have room service, it does not really need it as it is connected to a place called Heavenly, which is one of the best restaurants in the city.There is a rooftop pool which is nice, but relatively small. It could be better maintained, but it is a decent feature.The only real downside for this hotel is that if you are on the south-facing side, you'll be looking right at a building that appears to be condemned. This means that you probably won't be sitting on your balcony too often, but it's not really a hardship (especially on the higher floors). I'd suggest asking for a north-facing room, which if on a high enough floor, may give you a bit of a view of the canal.I would happily stay at the Shoreline on future trips.",,BC_NY_Traveler,6,4.0

The pool is a great way to cool and deck chairs are available but the pool and the surrounding area can get easily crowded due to its small size. The room size, facilities and bed are all adequate. Cleaning was not always meticulous as I did notice hairs left in the bath and basin. I did have problems with the card ""key"" which did not allow me to get into my room. It flashed a red button on the door lock and I had to get the receptionist to ""reset"" the key. An easy fix problem though. The other main problem was the intermittent air conditioning. The air conditioning only works with the card entered into the wall slot. However my card was in the slot but it still showed on the air conditioning system as ""unoccupied"". So I called reception to get a repair guy to come and look at it. He did come to the room quickly and adjusted/reset the settings. My mum had a similar issue when we first arrived.

The best thing that can be said about this hotel is its central location with shopping, restaurants, and Waikiki beach easily accessible within walking distance.Other than that, this property doesn't have much going for it. The so called pool at the top of the roof is a joke: it's tiny, there are only a couple of sun chairs, and it's surrounded by noisy air vents making it very unpleasant to be up there. My room was small with very limited storage space. When I wanted to make use of the guest vouchers giving me a discount at a 24 hour Fitness gym a couple of blocks away, I was told they were out of vouchers. Instead, much to my embarrassement, I had to ask the gym to give me the discount without the voucher (which they did, reluctantly). Worst of all was the inconsistent level of customer service. Some front desk staff were just so nonchalant, slow, and unwilling to assist me, a first time Hawaii visitor, with directions and suggestions, that I eventually had to put my foot down and file a complaint. Really unpleasant and unnecessary; had their staff shown more professionalism and courtesy this situation could have been avoided. A bottle of wine was later sent to my room along with an apologetic note (see attached photo). While I appreciate the gesture it didn't alter my view of this hotel nor did it resolve the issues I had in planning excursions etc on the island.In summary: a hotel with a good location but with no restaurant of its own, no proper swimming pool, no fitness room, no proper concierge service, small guest rooms, and uneven customer service. Would I stay here again if I were to return to Honolulu? No. The Shoreline is not cheap, and I expected more and better.","Stockholm, Sweden","Larshie_B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",51,2.0

Stayed 5 nights with most of the time off exploring Oahu so only needed a basic clean convenient place to stay and this fit the bill. Rates were ok (AUD low so it was not going to be a good deal anywhere). Short 10min walk to Waikiki beach with shops to see along the way. 5 min walk to bus stop on Kuhio Ave for the day where we did not have a car. Close to convenience stores, eateries, very close to cheesecake factory, across the road from a Ross store which was open until very late- made for lots of things to do and easy drop off back at hotel.I would recommend Shoreline for those after a balance of shops & beach/ or off most of the time exploring other parts of the island. This end of the beach is closer to the main shops & eateries, market across the road, and offers more to do and see in the evenings. If we had stayed around the center of the strip, it would be quite a long walk every day back and forth to the action.  Room is smallish but tidy and clean and the view was overlooking a back street and another apartment hotel which was acceptable and about what you can expect for non -beachside hotels in Waikiki. There is a coffee maker in room plus a mini fridge which was sufficient to keep a few sushi rolls cool overnight. Did not bother to visit pool.The attached Heavenly Lifestyle Cafe was highly rated in reviews so we ate there twice- dinner & breakfast.

The Valet was the first encounter with the staff of this hotel. That encounter could have been better! Not so very friendly!But the frontdesk made that all beter and we were welcomed very friendly. Checkin was quick and efficient. The roomwas not big, but it was nice, bright, fresh and above all clean! The decor is a bit 1930's, but all new furniture and looks very fresh. From the small balcony we had a great view on the mountains. The room was very quiet so we slept well. Internet was really fast and very stabile. So it is possible! It seemed that every room had its own wifi acces point with fast acces. At first it didn't work, but after some action of the frontdesk we managed to login. Defenitely compliments about that!On our first morning around 7 o'clock the fire alarm went off. No problem offcourse, just follow the instructions and go outside. But outside there was no one to pick us up or inform us on what was going on. When we went in we heard that it was a false alarm. Also no problem, but the communication on that could have been better! Because it was allready warm and humid we wanted to shower, because we were sweaty. But there was no water coming out of the tap or shower. So called the frontdesk and apparently they knew there was no water because of a leak. Als no information from the frontdesk. So all in all its a good hotel in a great location for good value, but when something isn't going exactly right the communication could be improved. I would defenitely come back to this hotel.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","vinceG768</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",63,4.0

Made sure I had very quiet room and always was there to help!Loved water, ice tea, and coffee.Always got help from bell / valet.Great location! Felt safe in area too and not too far from beach.A/c worked well, but had to turn off at night. Very loud!Fridge and microwave great to have for breakfast.

They left ironing board up for 2 days and had to put note to have them put away.Garbage cans too small in room, need to be larger.Overall a good experience for working, clean and reasonably cheap.

Upon checking in, the room was found to be very small and hot. You have to leave your room key in a slot in the wall for the air to work. However, after a long period of time, our room did not seem to cool down. Maintenance was called and responded within about 15 mins. Very courteous. He replaced a part and left. Although the fan power was not that great, it eventually did cool down. I would have liked it cooler though. The room was equipped with a Keurig coffee maker and a small refrigerator. They supply you with 2 regular coffees, a tea and decaf coffee. The first 2 are free, then you must pay $2 for any additional Keurig coffee pods. We stopped and got a 10 pack at the ABC store for about $1 a cup. There is also free coffee in the lobby at all times. Free WiFi, and it seemed to work pretty good, no glitches. After a shower on the first night, we experienced a slow drain in the tub and stood in water. Again, maintenance responded quickly and fixed the problem. The bed was comfortable, housekeeping did a wonderful job. The view is not good with the building next door. Ocean view is a thin slice between larger buildings. Although we did go see the pool, we did not utilize it. The bathtub could use a re glazing as they are old and yellowed - a noticeable contrast to the white walls. I am not sure of the nightly rate we had as we booked air and hotel together at a bulk rate. Place is convenient walking distance to everything in Waikiki. Even with the negatives, I would still stay here again. I would just stay in the larger room (which I have stayed in before as it used to be owned by United Airlines). Can't beat the location.

Why offer something but not ensure it is available? Whenever I went to get a coffee it was all out. Once I went to get a tea instead but there was no hot water!The rooms are on the small side but functional. Has to be the smallest lanai (balcony) I have ever seen. They have a coffee maker in the room with some free pods (and you have to pay after that). I tried one and the taste out of the machine was disgusting. It wasn't the coffee but the taste of stale water and crud. They should clean the machines.The bathroom was OK but a bit dated.

The hotel is in a great location, just a short walk to the beach, restaurants and shopping. Obviously we would have loved to stay at one of the bigger resorts on the beachfront but we were on a budget and got a great rate, and we weren't disappointed at all. All of the reception staff were extremely helpful (in particular PT who recommended amazing places to eat) and we loved the pineapple iced tea in the lobby.","Cairns, Australia","Rach_Toune</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cairns, Australia</strong>",6,5.0

It was showing wear and tear. The bathroom was basic, but good, with a small tub and plenty of room. The Shoreline is a three star hotel at best. It was relatively inexpensive compared to the bigger hotels around. That said, we paid over 150 dollars a night. That's quite a lot, as far as I'm concerned.

There is a self parking garage across the street for $24/day or valet for $30/day. The garage is VERY tight and only takes cash. The rooftop pool is quite small and views of the beach/ocean are quite limited by larger buildings all around. The room cleaning wasn't perfect on all days with the trash can not being emptied one day and a damp towel being left on my night table. Wifi connection was free but kept dropping out. Lobby connection was much more solid. Pretty minor stuff actually. The positive. Rooms were spacious and clean. The location while not on the beach is right in the heart of Honolulu, plenty to do at anytime. Waikiki beach is a 5-10 min walk and the hotel will provide beach towels if you need them. There is coffee, pineapple tea, and cucumber water in the lobby. All of the staff was friendly and helpful.A hotel that won't blow you away with luxury and amenities but won't blow up your wallet either without making you feel dirty for being cheap. A quality hotel at a reasonable price in a wonderful location.","Waldorf, Maryland","Justin D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waldorf, Maryland</strong>",0,4.0

You want the beach you pay for it, this was more than close enough. Most things you want to be near are just walking distance away. 24/24 Coffee and choice of two cold beverages in the foyer.The property is neat and clean.The Bad. The room size was very small. The bathroom was fine but the main room was just too small. Admittedly we were at the end of a 4 week vacation and had two large bags but there was no room to open them. We ended up with one against a wall and the other right in the middle of the room, which meant you had to navigate around it. The 'City View' was the building across the street, but I guess you don't come to Honolulu to look out you hotel window, but it is nice to see some pleasant sight. Strangely the wardrobe storage was adequate. The WiFi was a little ordinary and I could not log onto my room and had to go through a room downstairs.In summary if your looking for a good reasonably priced hotel in a good location this one fits the bill, just be warned don't expect to have too much room to spare.If you stay here make sure you visit 'Ross', which is right across the road.","Wollongong, Australia","Michael_edn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wollongong, Australia</strong>",82,4.0

It was definitely decent overall -- the bed was comfortable and the room size was fine for two people. However, it certainly did not meet my expectations after my research on TripAdvisor and other sites, including the hotel's. The building itself seemed to be very old and it showed from the moment we walked into the lobby to our room and bathroom.The building/lobby -- Hawaii is very warm in the summer and I was expecting to walk into the hotel and immediately feel pretty good. I get it, a lot of hotels in tropical places have an open-air concept, but the lobby was stifling and the valet parking area/entry into the lobby from the parking side smelled terrible for the 3 days we stayed. The folks at the lobby were decently kind, but no one went above and beyond.. the lady behind the front desk hardly broke a smile -ever-, and due to the heat, the entire lobby area seemed rundown. I didn't try the hotel restaurant because it was so hot and it was open air. I didn't enjoy sweating while checking in and getting settled. The room -- In general, the room is fine. The bed was very comfortable, so that was wonderful. We slept very well both nights. However, the room was very plain, raggedy... not at all like the photos. The bathroom slept strongly like chlorine or some cleaning chemical, and it was just old. In order to save energy, the rooms do not have AC on when in between guests, so we walked into a warm, stifling room. Once we turned on the AC, however, it was fine and pleasant. We had a regular room, no special view, just other buildings' rooftops and parking areas.The pool -- We visited the pool one day and were a little shocked. It was a tiny pool with one chair... that was it. There was nothing done to make the area pleasant, nowhere to put your belongings... The small pool is enclosed in a small 'rooftop' that has high walls around the pool so you see only the walls if you choose to go inside the pool. We left after getting over the shock.Parking -- Valet parking is available, which we used, and the valet staff were kind and efficient, prompt.Wifi -- Good!I won't stay here again unless there was no other option. Overall, it is fine, but might as well splurge on nicer hotels if you come all the way to Hawaii. We needed a quick stay and we know the local area well, so we didn't need a nicer hotel, but I would be a little irritated if I had come all the way there for a dream Hawaii vacation to stay in an old place like this.","Arlington, Virginia","dc20202</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arlington, Virginia</strong>",32,2.0

That's the way I feel about the Shoreline. Waikiki is expensive--hotel prices can rival New York--so keep that in mind; I am comparing the Shoreline's price points to others in that range in Waikiki. Here's what I loved--rooms and the airy lobby have extra style for that boutique feeling; there is a small fridge and microwave in the room, and real mugs and glasses--none of that paper stuff that just feels cheap. The location is excellent--and you will save money by not being on the beach. The beach however is one block away, and you are right off a main street that has tons of restaurants and shopping. The hotel is also right next to a very decent restaurant connected to it for breakfasts and the like. My hotel room was higher up, so noise was not a problem at all--the view was not great, but on some sides of the hotel you will be looking at Diamond Head in the distance. Staff was friendly and available. Keep in mind this is not a resort--it's a hotel that gives you want you want (free decent wifi, free coffee and tea in the lobby, valet service, and perhaps removes the things you don't like an in-hotel spa or gym). One piece of advice, I was there alone, so the room sizes which can be on the small side, were very adequate.

Very clean, good quality fittings etc. , free drinks available in lobby which is nice touch. Nice location , easy walk to beach through shopping/mall area and Sheraton. Liked drinks at Rumfire which was recommended by reception. No parking was available at hotel so had to use multi storey opposite which wasn't great and not cheap but think that is par for the course in Waikiki - some lifts at car park were out of use with construction works so check which floor is best to use before you go in. No hotel dining or eating facilities but there is a bar/restaurant attached called 'Heavenly,' however this did not live up to is name for us. Staff out front who were seating customers were rude and unwelcoming, slow service and very lukewarm breakfast which we sent back and had to wait over twenty minutes to be replaced and it was still not hot - real shame because the menu looked good and quality of food seemed high. After that the staff didn't even look at us and did not acknowledge us as we said goodbye.Streets outside hotel have a big mix of people especially at night so just be aware if you are wandering. Market in alley opposite hotel was quite high pressure sales with prices dropping 70% odd as they kept trying to get a sale - beware!!Chinese style diner on corner to left as you leave hotel was very good value for breakfast - food good - not smartest place but worked well for us.Also recommend Hans Hedemann Surf school - they picked up from hotel and we had a fantastic time surfing on Waikiki beach - and it was well away from the madness of the central beach - do it - its great !!","London, United Kingdom","karenlatebooker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",10,4.0

The room was clean but the small wardrobe was poorly fitted as the doors were too big for the space (resulting in a sore hand trying to close it).

The hotel was a great location, just down from the main road Kalakua Avenue (shopping heaven) and minutes from the beach. Short walk to Lewers Street with restaurants galore (try Yard House), Sushi shop down the road (small place but great sushi!), ABC and Ross discount store just across the road. The rooms were clean, spacious and had everything we needed! Free water in fridge, coffee machine, Cable TV. Small balcony. Shower head in bathroom was the best I've come across. Beach towels available at reception. Wifi worked ok, did drop out quite a bit but did it's job. The Pineapple Iced Tea and Cucumber Mint water in the lobby was a welcome treat daily after exploring the Island. The cafe next door is the BOMB! I actually can't explain how good it was to eat some wholesome HEALTHY food at HEAVENLY cafe - try the Acai Bowls, Pittaya Bowls, Loco Moco, Eggs Benedict and Pho soup - really amazing. The smoothies were great too. (This cafe actually saved me from going insane with all the unhealthy American food on offer around the place!!)

Our flight arrived very late evening and we had booked a King with a City View. We were checked into a very dark room on the 2nd floor with no balcony. Given that we were staying 4 days here, we really wanted to change rooms and called the front desk but were told there was no other room available, although we asked if we could move in the morning, we were given a very non-committal answer. Given we had just had a very long flight, we just decided to accept our fate but were not happy. The next morning, we were up early and spoke to Mona at the front desk. She was AMAZING! Unlike the service we received the night prior, she immediately started looking for an alternate room for us. She asked us regarding our plans for the day, and did her utmost to offer us an alternate room before we began our day's activities. She provided us with a few options and we were moved about 1 hour after speaking with her (the previous guests had just checked out and Housekeeping was starting on the room). We were moved to a Partial Ocean View (upgrade) with a Queen bed (small downgrade). Despite the new room only having a queen size bed, it was on a much higher floor (ie brighter!) with a tiny balcony. Location IS great but had it not been for Mona's warm hospitality and service, and the move to the new room, I can say that I would NOT have recommended this hotel. The room we stayed in made all the difference! FYI: the room itself comes with 2 small water bottles (upon initial check-in only). Amenities in the room include a small fridge and microwave. Free wifi. Lobby always has chilled water and pineapple iced tea, coffee / hot water, apples (usually), newspapers and a business centre. The hotel can arrange for an airport shuttle (cost ~$13 per person) on a smaller shuttle = generally fewer stops. The pool is tiny and although it is on the rooftop - only has 4 sun loungers so these were often taken. My recommendation to management would be to also include some chairs (I do recognize it is a small surface area so there is not a lot of terrace room). Traveller tip: make sure you upgrade your room to one that is on a higher floor (so you don't need to see the nasty building next door) and get more of that Hawaiian sunshine you've come for!","Ontario, Canada","Frenchie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ontario, Canada</strong>",76,3.0

I arrived early and my room wasn't ready so I asked to be pointed in the direction of a good bar whilst I waited and it was a good recommend. The location was perfect-being on my own and with no car I needed to be near to everything. The staff were lovely-I think I remember Karin being the one who helped me first and then I think it was Mona who checked me in but they were all really nice and friendly. My room had a view of the building I think has been mentioned on here as an eyesore but I was fascinated by it. I invented little stories about what the rooms were used for (well I am holidaying alone-got to do something to keep me amused!). There is a lift just to the left of the entrance and if you press the button someone will come out and help you with your bags. And the Heavenly restaurant which is attached but not part of was a tad expensive but well worth it-I ate there 3 times during my stay. The pool on the roof is very small but there was only ever max of about 3 people up there when I went. Once it was just me! All in all a good clean friendly hotel. ,,Janey A,4,5.0

The hotel doesn't have a restaurant but has the restaurant ""Heavenly"" is attached next door. Boy there food is great! So convenient, fresh and taste better than a lot of the food in the area.

I stayed here over Christmas in 2014. The positive, the rooms are a decent size, there is a restaurant connected to the hotel, there is a pool on-site, and you are walking distance to multiple restaurants and sites in the area. I had no problem finding my way to the beach, to find food, or go shopping. The negatives, the hotel has a shady policy (maybe only during holiday season) that they will upcharge you at check-in for double beds. It would be one thing if this policy is noted in writing somewhere, but it is not. Even though my travel agent listed a request for a 2 bed room, I was told there would be an additional fee per night for the room. I am well aware that bedding requests are not guaranteed, however if they have the room that was requested at the time of booking available on site they are supposed to give it to and definitely not try to charge you for it. The desk attendant flat out told me that they do this because they can get extra money out of people during the high season. I was very upset by this, luckily my travel agent covered the additional cost but they should not have had to. Aside from this when I finally got into my room it was not as clean as it should have been and they had to come and change the sheets. This is a budget hotel, so I was not expecting the Ritz. If it had not been for the unscrupulous extortion of extra money and the dirty sheets I would not have had anything bad to say about the resort. Overall, I had a decent stay but I would not recommend this place to anyone because you don't know what you're going to get at check in.","Exton, Pennsylvania","D J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Exton, Pennsylvania</strong>",3,3.0

We booked a two double bed room and asked for a quiet room. Our room was not an ocean view room and was on the non seaward side of the hotel and it was quiet. Efficient aircon, comfortable beds, good wifi, clean and refurbished - carpet, paint, framed prints, furniture. Microwave and fridge. Coffee maker. Small balcony. Lobby area bright, airy, and modern while still being personal and comfortable. Desk staff polite, helpful and pleasant. Next door to Heavenly Restaurant which has fresh and organic food but is not cheap but decent food in Waikiki costs, especially with the AUD at the moment. Great service and food! Shoreline had efficient check in and check out and billing. Only cons for me were there is no ramp to wheel suitcases in and out of hotel, stairs only. But I'm sure the staff would organise help if requested. On one day our room wasn't serviced but towels etc promptly delivered when I asked.

It's right in the heart of Waikiki - steps to shops, restaurants, etc. Bear in mind, staying here you will feel like you're staying in the middle of a big city, which you are. You won't feel like you're on a quiet island or in a relaxing Hawaiian resort. You will however be little more than a block from the beach. Service. The kids working the front desk were superb. They really were like tour directors. They took the time to explain how to get places, gave recommendations, and were generally helpful. Would I stay here again? I don't know. Maybe if I were just stopping over on the way to another island. But if you're on a budget and want to be in the heart of everything, this is probably a good option for you. Probably.","La Jolla, California","E4140JIbobb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Jolla, California</strong>",54,3.0

The room is big, clean, nicely furnished, and I was lucky enough to have a partial ocean view, and a view of the pink Royal Hawaiian hotel which is really pretty!

We were staying here for a week. On first sight , lots of stairs leading to reception ! There is a small lift outside but you need to go to reception to use it, so we dragged our three heavy cases up the stairs. Our room wasn't ready on arrival at about 1:30 pm so the staff stored our luggage and we went for a walk around. This hotel is in a great location just 5/10 walk to Waikiki beach, also right in the shopping area , I've never seen so many designer shops in one area! This island is very busy and crowded. Went back to hotel , given room on 14th floor. The room was small, the bed was small and uncomfortable, it has a mattress on a wooden base, every time you get in and out of bed you bang your legs! I lost count of the amount of times we walked into the wooden frame. There is free wifi in all areas, free tea and coffee and iced water , apples in the lobby, tea and coffee making facilities in the room, but you have to pay for it after your first free cup! There is a walk in closet,with a safe and a high shelf for clothes etc, which I couldn't reach! There are no draws for your things other than a small shallow one on the desk and in the one bedside table. There was a balcony but it was small and scarey! It's very windy at night so make sure. You don't leave towels out they will blow away! The small swimming pool was also on this floor there are only four sun beds so first come first served! There is a small restaurant at the side of the hotel but we didn't eat there. I think this hotel has a great location and is ok for a few nights, it didn't really suit us.

This is on top of the apples and newspapers available every day in the same area.The hotel provides free fresh towels for the beach or whatever, right in the lobby. This helps a lot!Hotel doors lock after 11pm and can be accessed with a room key (nice security feature)There is a nice little restaurant attached to the hotel, but you are only a few hundred feet away from Kalakaua ave and Kuhio ave.This includes McDonald's, Starbucks, multiple ABC stores etc etc and a Ross store that is open until 1am every day right across the streetThe rooms are not very large but more than plenty for our family of four. We had a queen bed and brought our own queen blow-up for the kids which the hotel had no issues with (not many rooms have 2 beds at this hotel). This saved us a ton of money.There is a K-cup coffee maker in the room (bring some from home) and a small fridge.AC was quiet and worked well. Elevators were fast and quiet, even though our room was next to them.Rooftop pool was simple, with decent views ( we never used it, why bother with Waikiki beach there?)Parking is $28 a night, but all hotels in Waikiki charge a lot to park. I parked for free every night along the Ala Wai canal, but you have to hunt for a spot and be prepared to walk back some distance (your choice)Everything was clean and we had no issues, will stay here again.ps, Thanks Stella at the front desk, you are very helpful and friendly!","Kelowna, Canada","Frans P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kelowna, Canada</strong>",2,5.0

The people were typically very helpful and friendly, and the cleaning staff were spot on. Any questions I had were answered quickly, and if they didn't have the answer, they went online to find it for me.One of the better aspects of the hotel is the location - right across a one-way street from the Waikiki Trade Center. That might not seem relevent, until you realize that almost all of the tour buses park there. So, if you're going to Germaine's Luau, or the Polynesian Centre, or Pearl Harbor, you can just hang in your room or the lobby until the bus drives up - no standing on the curb waiting for a bus. There is also a city bus stop just around the corner, so that was handy.The only downside to the hotel was two-fold: one, no in-room movies, (which can be a problem when the weather isn't nice for being outdoors; and, two, parking is $27 a day. The movies thing isn't terrible if you have a device that can stream (free wi-fi, of course), but the parking is prohibitive, since most car rentals start at $40-$50 per day already. Get ready to utilize those tour buses and transit!Overall, it was a great place to stay, and the price is very competitive with other hotels in the area. I actually went to look at other hotels that I had seen online, and the minor savings I may have realized by staying in lower-cost hotels were not worth what the condition of those hotels was.","Vancouver, Canada","Kirt777</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",4,4.0

The next morning I requested a room away from the street and was given one towards the rear of the property. The noise situation in no way reflects on the hotel itself but the way that the staff handled it does. They were sympathetic and gave us another room and followed up as to whether the new room was OK.The rooms themselves were a bit on the small side but were very clean and had a ""nice"" feel and a comfy bed. We received small complementary bottles of water on the first day but not on consequent days which I found a little odd.The location is great and there are a number of bars/restaurants and shopping in the surrounding blocks and is only a short walk to the beach.The reception staff were all relatively young but obviously very competent which I found refreshing and fit with the overall feel of the hotel.I would stay here again if I returned to Waikiki.","Newcastle, Australia","MickeyMouse179</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle, Australia</strong>",45,4.0

When booking with Shoreline I'd requested an early room if available but when I raised this with the reception staff she wasn't, unfortunately, very helpful on the matter. I was met with a shrug of the shoulders and a ""we can just see if one comes free"" response. Not a good first impression. Despite leaving a contact number to be sent a SMS if a room became available before the 3pm check-in she didn't bother contacting me. By chance we returned to the hotel around 1pm and spoke with a different member of reception (who was also extremely helpful in advising us of what was available in the area) to find that rooms were free. Hurrah! Our room was a city view on the 3rd floor. Despite a very bleak outlook (keep the curtains closed) the room was very well presented and kudos to the domestic staff on the cleanliness of the place. The beds are so comfortable and rooms are an adequate size for what we paid. The free water was a bonus but it may have been a nice touch to have this replenished daily. Check-out was smooth and straight forward although it would have been nice to be met with a smile. We returned to Shoreline after 3 nights on the north shore and on this occasion there were no problems with checking-in (albeit we arrived at 6pm). We'd also been given rooms on the 12th floor which was a bonus as there was a big difference in noise level (nice and quiet) and the queen size bed was bliss. Early morning check-out was a pain as there was only one staff member rostered on and we had a cab waiting for a good 10 minutes despite getting to reception desk earlier. I'd definitely recommend this place for friends travelling together but just a few tips: - earlier check-in time or at least the availability of a hospitality room - staff were generally helpful but a tip: smiling never hurt anyone - replenish the water daily and the water jug/coffee maker had a terrible taste to it - more staff available for checking-outGreat location though and high standards of cleanliness.","Sydney, Australia","HarperTimes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",39,3.0

This suite contained all amenities we needed including a fridge, iron, hairdryer, free wifi, free beach towel rental etc, however when we were upgraded to the king suite on our return, we found this room did not contain a fridge. Their is no tea & coffee in the rooms, however this is available, along with iced tea in the reception area. This location can be noisy at night, however ceases when you close the sliding glass balcony door. The staff were excellent, attended to all needs immediately. After much research, I found the Shoreline to be the best value for money in a great location, I was not disappointed. This hotel is a real treasure and recommend it to all travelers and can't wait to holiday there again soon.","Tweed Heads, Australia","shazzaAlbury</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tweed Heads, Australia</strong>",15,5.0

If the big resort pools etc is what you are after then the Shoreline is not for you but you need to way up if that is what you are after in a holiday. I knew when we were in Waikiki we had planned to be out and about most days so were rarely at the resort during the day, the money we saved by staying at the Shoreline compared to the beach front resorts could be spent on other pleasures!

I had requested an early check in before travelling to Hawaii and when we arrived at the Shoreline, my request wasn't even acknowledged until I asked about it. It was of course denied so we set off for the day and came back at check in. On check in, we were surprised to learn that we couldn't pay cash at check in (as previously told we could) and the total amount would be pre-authorised on my credit card and we could pay at the end of our stay. I was incredibly upset about learning of this credit card authorisation as we were not aware and had all our holiday money in cash, not on my card. When trying to sort this out with Zhi, another front desk staff named Jerome decided to add his two cents on this situation, reducing me to tears and bullying me over the front desk. ""THIS IS OUR HOTEL POLICY"" he borderline yelled at me - to which I replied, please stop talking off to the side of me you are making me feel very uncomfortable. His response - ""I am not to the side of you, I am right in front of your face. I'm sorry but is this how you make your guests feel welcome? It immediately set a negative tone of this hotel for our stay and I do not appreciate been made to feel like this. It is poor customer service and Jerome shouldn't be speaking to guests like this. I was incredibly upset. We finished our check in process and made our way to our room. Be warned, the photos are a little misleading but the room was satisfactory and was clean and comfortable. One thing I will mention, every afternoon when we came back to our room, big bags of rubbish and old linen from the room attendants cleaning other rooms, was constantly left outside our door - not very nice to come back to every day and started to smell! I sent an email to the hotel manager, explaining my unhappiness at the check in process and was very touched by his kind apology - thank you for the wine and chocolates they were greatly appreciated. Not the worst hotel I'm sure, but lots of room for improvement in todays competitive market.","Sydney, Australia","Amanda S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",75,3.0

The bed was tiny a little less then a queen and we managed to have all three in the bed each night. The room was smaller the a cruise ship room. Very little.

The hotel is clean and the staff is extremely friendly. We booked the queen room which was on the smaller size but we didn't care because we were only in the room to shower and sleep. Each room has a fridge, microwave & Keurig machine which was a nice bonus. The lobby always had fresh water, pineapple iced tea, hot tea & coffee. The front desk staff was the best! - Mona (Jersey!!), Taro, Alex & Zhi were always chatting with us and giving us suggestions on where to eat, drink and swim (there are some great beaches on the north shore). We've stayed at larger hotels in Waikiki but we preferred this hotel. It was nice to have the staff remember where we were from and other small details about us. They made us feel at home which we loved.As for the area - Waikiki beach is only a 5 minute walk and the hotel provides beach towels. All the restaurants and bars are within walking distance as well. Heavenly is a great restaurant for breakfast right next to the hotel - it is a must try! Duke's (in the Outrigger) has a great breakfast buffet. Yard House (on Lewers street) is a great sports bar - over 100 beers on tap. Doraku (in Royal Hawaiian center) is great for sushi. Rum Fire (in the Sheraton hotel) is great for drinks.

The lobby was stylish and offered somewhere to sit if you don't want to go straight back to your room after a day out exploring. And Heavenly, the restaurant attached to the hotel was funky and cute and had lovely food that offered a healthier alternative to most of the offerings in the area. We had a corner room on the third floor, and my advice to anyone staying this low down would be not to sleep with the window open. We did on the first night and were awoken by a lot of street noise, garbage trucks etc. On subsequent nights we kept the window shut and didn't have this problem at all. My only complaint would be that although we booked months prior, and specifically asked for a higher room (both at time of booking and on arrival), the hotel didn't seem at all interested in trying to accommodate this. So we were slightly disappointed to be put on a low floor, with no balcony, and as others have noted, a very drab street view.

As it's the most popular place to stay in Honolulu, the prices are surely higher. Shoreline Hotel surprised me with its very reasonable price (indeed!) in relation to its wonderful location. Kalakaua Ave and Kuhio Ave, two principal streets, with all the possible shops, bars and restaurants you ever need (some of them have ocean view) are literally around the corner. Famous Waikiki beach in 5 minutes walk, the next one (plus 2 minutes) is less crowded Kuhio Beach. If you don't have a car, the bus stops are also right here: 10-15 min ride to Ala Moana, 20 min to the Downtown with its fascinating sights and nice places to eat, 15 min to Diamond Head. Other magnicifent Oahu sights are also reachable directly from here but it's gonna take some time. The location is the thing we really loved.Overall hotel's condition was OK. We liked the hotel's interior decor, it's nice and modern. They even have this nice blackboard with daily surf conditions, Oahu events, things to eat, etc. But the room wasn't so bran-new. Some renovations are needed, it's not critical, just some minor things you would notice. I would also prefer to have some shelves in a wardrobe. Anyway, you're not here to sit in a room. So, we weren't dissapointed. What else.. medium-sized room, rather clean, nice bathroom (also may need to be a little bit renovated), very good WiFi signal. A balcony is a very nice thing. I suppose, most or even all? rooms have balconies. We had the Downtown view. If you're lucky, some of rooms must have the ocean view (just an assumtion based on the building layout).Another nice touch. They provide you with beach towels free-of-charge. Be sure to ask about it in the morning. Once, they ran out of it when we asked for it in the afternoon. What drew my attention is that I'd found out about beach towels thing from some brochures in the room not from the staff (of course, it's not obligatory but would've showed client treat).So, the staff and hospitality in general. I am rather satisfied than not, but it could be better. Just a couple of examples. The first one.They kindly agreed to receive a delivery for us (I had a broken wrist and was waiting to get a special cover for my cast). But it was me who inquired about its status all the time. They told me they would tell me once it's arrived but I had to ask myself. Of course, it's also not obligatory but, once again, would be very nice as the hotel tries to show oneself as client-oriented. The second one. Mustn't be the case for most of the people, but we had mostly cash for our trip due to this crazy ruble rate (you never know how the bank will convert it to dollar the next day). The hotel requires a deposit for incidental charges and for the hotel stay. A gentleman, who checked us in, in the late night hour (24 hours desk is definitely a plus), allowed us to pay in cash for the room and also to provide a cash deposit (though in amount exceeding a card deposit). We were told that it was exceptional and some staff members, possibly, wouldn't checked us in. Yes, it's a very particular and uncommon situation that wouldn't be an issue for 99.9% guests but it would be helpful to clearly describe all the conditions in a reminder email they send.In conclusion, a slight misunderstanding with staff or a room probably lacking of renovation couldn't outshine the beautiful location, the reasonable price and Hawaiian relaxing atmosphere. Next time I'm in Oahu, I would probably go for this place.","Moscow, Russia","R0zaS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Moscow, Russia</strong>",31,4.0

We should have booked the VIVE HOTEL with free breakfast instead.Bad things: The reception is the worst we have ever experienced. The two Asian looking guys are unfriendly and standoffish. They expected a tip after we flew 10hrs and waited almost 5hrs to get into our room. When people would walk past they did not greet or say hello ever, they would just look away and act busy, not the charm you expect from a front reception. In my opinion this is CRUCIAL to a stay, they were not overly helpful, did not provide bus maps or anything unless we probed. It was like we had to force information out of them. We felt apprehensive every time we walked through lobby area as there was certainly no 'Joie de Vivre' whatsoever. We kept saying wouldn't it be great if we had helpful, friendly and outgoing people at reception. There was one girl at the last day who was a breath of fresh air though and was what you would expect. The other guys are severely bringing down the hotel morale and should be replaced if they expect people to have a good experience.The room gets really stuffy, you need aircon on almost all the time, the rooms are small and dingey not like the pictures and they are not well laid out, aircon is loud & blows on you at night.The bathroom toilet flooded once, they did not apologise and just said housekeeping will take a look. It was fixed but didn't seem to work properly. The shower hot water isn't hot either, you wait 5 mins for lukewarm water to come through. LADIES the lighting in the bathroom is one of those seedy fluorescent lights you see in office buildings, I literally looked like a goblin the whole time under this lighting and that was actually really off-putting, unforgiving and totally inappropriate for a hotel bathroom. Fresh sheets were questionable. We had a problem with our hire car booking and had to use the room phone at midday, housekeeping staff were pushy and knocked 4 times in a half hour period to get us out, even though it states its available till 5pm?! We explained what was happening but then reception even called us to ask when we were leaving. This was very rude. The last day our bathmat was missing so had to stand on handtowel. My advice - If you want to maximise your time in paradise stay in a hotel with great front desk service as its paramount to knowing where to go what to do and how to get around but also just makes you feel great while you're there! Try the Vive Hotel or Coconut Waikiki, anything right near this location will be great. Included breakfast would help speed things up.Warning - Don't stay here until its renovated and re-staffed.",Sydney,"Aussies_In_Town</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",8,2.0

It took me about 10 minutes circling around the block to figure out where to park (the answer was you drive up a ramp that says ""Valet Parking"" while you check in. I highly recommend paying for the parking if you have a car and plan to use it to tour the island). I was, however, very impressed right off the bat with the friendly staff. The desk managers were both very knowledgable, courteous and professional. The valet parking attendant doubled as the bellmanand he too was pleasant and helpful, as was his relief on the following day. The desk staff and bellman began to turn around my negative first impression. When I got to the room, I found it small but efficient and very clean. The general location in Waikiki, of which I was a little dubious at the start, proved to be in the middle of everything and quite convenient. A two minute walk around the block provided access to dozens of little shopping stalls with competitively priced merchandise that ranged from Hawaiian skirts and shirts, to all manner of jewelry, quilts, carved goods and signs. There was a wide variety of department stores within a two block walk, an Apple Store and a four story mall with an excellent food court on level 2. At night, the street corners transformed into stages for a variety of musicians, dancers and magicians, some of which were excellent. I especially enjoyed four street dancers who performed with flawless synchronization and individual spot performances of incredible speed and agility. One fellow whirled around on all fours, all in time to the music, and sprang into a one handed hand-stand, from which he bounced, on that one hand, at least half a dozen times. I've never seen anything to equal it. They were very talented. So in summary, the Shoreline is a great value, very neat and clean, with a five-star staff and comfortable accommodations in a central location, near to everything. We would go back if in the area again and will recommend it to our friends.","Virginia Beach, Virginia","jsouth46</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Virginia Beach, Virginia</strong>",2,4.0

Let's go through a few main points.Good things Shoreline has got going for it:1. Great location: From the airport you can take bus 19 or 20 straight to the stop that's 2 min walk from Shoreline. And it's very very easy to find. It is quite centrally located in Waikiki although on on the beach, which is protected by a concrete line of hotels and resorts. But you can easily walk onto the main strip with all the shops within a min. It's got a restaurant pretty much on premise and the famous rice ball shop next door. So you will never go hungry :)2. Reasonable rates: we got this deal through booking.com at a ""genius"" price and compare to the majority of Waikiki lodging options, it offered a rather reasonable rate. So if you are only using your hotel for crashing at night and plan to spend very little time in it, this is a good choice. Otherwise you wouldn't be very comfortable for the following reasons, which are also the Bad and unfortunate aspects about this place:1. Condition: I'd have to say this is one of the more run-down places I've seen in a while, even comparing to many pensions and hostels in less advanced parts of the world. I assure you that it's not what the professional photos look like. The carpet is very old and it just has that ""given up"" look to it. The bathroom tiles, although mopped, are permanently stained with dirt and grime. There are water leakage marks behind the toilet and etc. However everything is functional. 2. AC: I definitely caught a cold here in this hotel as the AC vent is directly facing our bed. It looks like a ceiling vent but on the wall, the direction of airflow cannot be changed. The only thing you can do is turning it off. Due to the humid condition of the room, even at a very high temperature setting, the air gave me a chill. But if you turn it off completely, it will get so stuffy and uncomfortable in the room.3. Noise: The hotel is in the middle of a commercial block so expect a lot of noise, even through the night. The view is abysmal, just other buildings all around it. But if you go up to the top deck where the pool is, you can see a sliver of the sea.4. Our horrible misfortune (I'm sure this is not a normal occurrence, but do consider the quality of service): long story short, on our second night the door lock of my parent's room gave up and this took us 4 trips up and down to the main desk to figure out. After about 30 mins, my parents were offered a temp room to sleep, note that they are without any essentials, and we were flying to Molokai the next day. The room is on a different floor and looked like a staff lounge. Later I asked for toiletries, which we had to fetch ourselves, only they were available as the front desk claimed. So that caused us more time getting stuff from our room and sending them to my parents. By then it was 11:30 pm. Then we get a call from the front desk asking if my parents can go back to their original room as the locksmith who is off site and came in an hour after being called for could not fix the lock and once he's gone, the door would not work again... The front desk took the liberty to wake my parents first without success before calling us to go and get my parents. At this point I just lost it. We found out that the locksmith actually went and knocked on their door after they didn't answer the phone and demanded that they move back. Being exhausted, they didn't. After all, we all got no sleep because basically the lack of facility maintenance became our burden and the locksmith's convenience was placed over that of 4 guests. We are not fussy travelers, we try to make do with what we have and not tolerates a lot of small imperfections. But this was just so sad! We probably spent more than an hour explaining this to the front desk the next morning. In the end, the manager waived the fee for one room for the second night. In my opinion, they didn't deserve anything for the 2nd night because none of the 4 of us got any sleep, plus dealing with the unpleasant and frustrating situation that's not our responsibility at all. Isn't rest and sleep the reasons for our staying in hotels?I try to stay objective in my reviews, otherwise the poor customer service alone would warrant a zero rating. But I understand that this is an uncommon situation and it wouldn't happen to all of the guests staying there. So this is as an indication of the general quality of this establishment.","New York, NY","Kingston D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NY</strong>",73,2.0

Some minor complaints—the AC was inconsistent, first too hot, then too cold—and there were very loud trucks on the street every morning about 530 or 6 am. The people at the desk were very friendly, but sometimes their information seemed questionable. Overall, a nice enough hotel and if you want to be in Waikiki, but can’t afford the resorts or are there for business not beach, this is the place for you.

It was adorable and comfortable. It was well appointed and VERY CLEAN!! The staff was always helpful and friendly. We had a room on the 14th floor and for the most part it was very quiet. You do hear the garbage trucks in the wee hours but I'm not sure there is any getting around that when you're in such an urban setting. The refreshing cold tea and cucumber water in lobby hit the spot when coming in from a day of activities. In the room there was a keurig with two complimentary pods; but you can hit the store and buy more. There wasn't a dresser to unpack for my 6 nite stay but all in all very cormfortable.My only recommendation to the hotel would be to add a few more chairs around the pool. It is a tight area but I think chairs and a little table would be fine as I'm not sure too many recliners would fit. This is a good value and the location can't be beat. Two blocks from the beach and two blocks from the canal if you want to get in a power walk or a run. The Udon Noodle is just a block away- so wonderful and such a good value. We took the city bus to Pearl Harbor- it took about an hour each way but can you beat the $2.50 fare each way; I don't think so!

I can't believe I waited so long to book this place because it's been the best hotel I've been to yet! I arrived from Sydney really early in the morning, and I was lucky enough that there was a room already available to check into. The room was a great size for my friend and I, and the bed was one of the most comfortable ever - 5 pillows EACH! The room amenities were perfect; clean and well maintained. I was happy to see a balcony, because it's rare to have them nowadays. We didn't have ""ocean"" views or anything, which we didn't mind at all as we came to Hawaii to enjoy the outdoors, not to stay in our rooms. In saying that though, we did have one day where we lounged in bed all. day. long... watched TV, ordered room service and made the most of their free in-room WiFi connection.Another plus was having the restaurant 'Heavenly' right next door. It's an absolutely amazing restaurant specialising in organic, healthy meals and drinks. I loved their shakes and every meal on their menu was tasty and refreshing. All members of the Shoreline staff were very polite and accommodating. Daniel and Jerome in particular were genuine and nice from the get-go and helped with any queries we had in a professional and prompt manner.

Short walk to shopping, beach, and restaurants. I have two big complaints. First, the rooms we were given were terrible, low floors, small, view of alley and parking lot. ""Each room has a balcony""; well, ours was more like a small, dirty ledge with one plastic chair. Not a boutique experience. Next, a boutique hotel is all about service. It was hit or miss. Many of the staff were friendly enough, but the main answer to any question was ""no"". I had family arriving after a long flight and wanted to check them in so they could refresh themselves, say noon or one. The answer was ""check in is at 3pm"". Then I asked if our room could be made up so they could rest there until theirs became available. ""Can't promise anything"" was the answer to that one (almost at noon).We were then going to Maui for 4 days, returning to the Shoreline after. I asked if we could store 1 bag until our return, just as I was about to head, in a rush, to the airport. It was items that weren't needed and wanted the added delay and cost of checking a bag and lugging it around. The answer was a lecture on their not wanting to accept liability and their limited storage space. I was offered a cash option to pay an unknown third party a $20 fee plus $5/day to come pick up, store and return the bag. I was stunned, having stored bags many times before, but stressed, with no options, and running out of time, I paid (of course leaving a bag with no receipt, with an unknown third party, no liability there, right?). After we returned, I limited our stay and moved to an excellent hotel that I will review separately. Finally, this might sound petty, but the beds weren 't all that comfortable (too soft), the tv was small and hard to see, the toiletries were 'mix and match' different brands, and the soap was old (dry, almost sandpapery on your skin -noticable and unpleasant). A bit of foolish penny-pinching going on here. In conclusion, a boutique hotel needs more than some hipster furniture in the lobby and some pineapple tea. It needs a service mentality and more helpful staff. Giving someone crappy rooms when they book multiple rooms for multiple stays is a bad idea. Sadly, Waikiki is pretty much like many tourist areas, where its about grabbing as much cash as possible, and don't worry about repeat business (and I have stayed at a number of JDV hotels and had better experiences).",San Fran,"trvlin_man</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Fran</strong>",255,2.0

One of us had to stand by the door so the other person could get around the bed to use the restroom. It was so small it had only one night stand. Pictures on their website show a room with a king bed and it is an average size room. Not as advertised. It looks like they tried to update the room a bit, but nasty water stains on the popcorn ceiling dated the place.

Our favorite is Heavenly, the best breakfast/brunch place in Waikiki, and it is just in the same building with the Shoreline hotel. Also, one minute walking gives you the Blue Marlin, the great restaurants on Kuhio, and many others! The lobby of Shoreline has a very modern design. The front desk staffs are very friendly, warm and helpful. It provides pineapple iced tea, cucumber mint water, hot water, and coffee 24/7-- all for free! We also got a lot of information about the island from them (Thanks, Mona!). There are also desktop computers available for use (first ~0.5 hour is free). Our room is a standard queen-bed room, which is minimal but very cozy. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom is very spacious and clean. Having TV is great, I didn't miss the Christmas games. Oh, free Wi-Fi is available at our room and lobby. For the rate, I would definitely recommend Shoreline Hotel to anyone who would like to stay at the Waikiki area and does not plan to spend too much time in the hotel. Again, I recommend Heavenly which is just 10-second walk away but has great breakfast/brunch selections. Cons:Our room is next to the elevator (just one wall apart), so the noise was annoying at first. Since it was the peak season, it was hard to change to another room for that night. I got a pair of earplugs from the front desk for free, and could not hear any noise at all. They offered to change our room from the second night but we didn't want the hustle. If you are not super sensitive like me, you should be fine. The swimming pool is not impressive (small and no view), but it is better than nothing.","Palo Alto, California","joshm2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palo Alto, California</strong>",1,5.0

The bathroom was spotlessly clean and the complementary shower gel & shampoo was not only good quality, it was very welcome, since it saved me having to unpack my bag. The aircon was a little fierce for my liking, but it adjusted easily enough and the temperature was soon more comfortable. The bed was quite large and very comfortable; the linen was of an unexpectedly high quality.There was free wifi, a large TV, fridge, coffee-maker (although a charge applied for further supplies, if needed) and an in-room safe.

After extensive research, the Shoreline had met all these requirements all within our budget, and so we booked and we were not disappointed. Shoreline is faultless in everyway.

Seaside Avenue is only one way and a little quieter than some of the other main roads but we slept with the balcony door open for fresh air (hate air conditioning) and it was mainly the garbage trucks we heard in the early hours that was noisy.The only problem was there were no set of drawers to unpack clothing into but adequate hanging space and bedside drawer and used my suitcase for storage.Only went up to the rooftop pool the day before we left to check it out and the view was great.The restaurant next door ""Heavenly"" had great food and service.Would definitely stay here again as the price was reasonable compared to the beachfront hotels but only a block away.

We were told our room had been upgraded because we were on honeymoon. It was a lovely big room with (just) a sea view and the most comfortable bed ever! Nice toiletries in the bathroom too! Oh and a fridge and microwave plus a coffee machine. The hotel is located just off the main street in Waikiki where there are (expensive!) shops (think Louis Vuitton) but there's also an H&M on the corner of the street. There are also loads of restaurants but because it's the main area it's not cheap to eat out here. Instead go the other direction out of the hotel and you'll find some better value options. The Seaside Bar & Grill up the road doesn't look much but does fantastic breakfasts. From the hotel it's only a short walk to Waikiki beach (which isn't really all that!) and you can easily catch buses to Pearl Harbor, downtown Honolulu and Diamond Head from a bus stop literally 2 minutes away. There is free coffee and fruit water in the lobby all the time, as well as a bowl of apples each morning. There is also pineapple iced tea during the day which is lovely and refreshing when you've been out all day. Really could not fault this hotel. We'd definitely stay there again if we ever returned to Oahu. The only negative is that the rooftop pool is quite small and the area around it isn't really in keeping with the rest of the hotel. But you've got Waikiki beach on the doorstep so that's not exactly an issue!! Oh and you can get beack towels from reception too.The staff are all really friendly and helpful and the hotel just has a really great relaxed and friendly vibe. Much better than all the monster hotels like Marriott etc. Yeah they front the beach and have gardens and huge pools but who goes all the way to Hawaii to spend all their time in the hotel anyway!

I knew that I would only be using it as a base to explore the island as I had rented a car for the 10 days. I booked hotel for my boyfriend and I as it was fairly cheap in comparison to most hotels in Waikiki. The photos of the lobby on the net are true to form - it is a nice lobby with free drinks (coffee, tea, flavoured water, peach iced tea, etc). The photos of the rooms are a bit misleading - the rooms themselves are a bit tired and dated, but they are clean. Will list the pros and cons:Pros:-price for location - really in the heart of Wakikik, great location for wandering to shops, restaurants and the BEACH!-easy check in process -balcony in most rooms (I believe)-clean -most staff are happy and helpful-free beach towels each daycons:-valet is usually full. this means you have to park across the street at the Waikiki Trade Centre parking lot. It's not that far, but you have to get a ticket each day from the valet to park across the street. The process is a bit cumbersome for a vacation. I would suggest that they just give you a ticket for the whole week if you desire it (nobody wants to deal with this daily on their vacation)-computer in lobby is free wifi, but it requires you to enter a credit card number - sorry this is a bit sketchy, so bring your own device and use the free wifi in the rooms.-one of the main desk people is a bit useless. I asked them about local attractions - I mean local MAIN attractions and they had no useful information to impart. I turned to trip advisor instead- you people save me all the time :) -bathrooms and rooms are a bit dated. The tiles in the bathroom look old and a bit grimy (not dirty grimy, just old and used). They could use an update.-rooms are a bit tight - try and pack light!Overall if you are looking for a crash pad in the city centre, this will defiantly serve your purpose. I would stay again for the price/location.Some other area tips: there is a Ross across the street that is open till 1am (I went one night after my boyfriend went to bed and snuck in some purchases ;), there is a starbucks and a jamba juice across the street in the Waikik Trade Centre concourse - super easy for something in the morning. The restaurant in the hotel - Heavenly, has 'heavenly' eggs benny - highly recommended and they serve it all day in case you want a light dinner. The restaurant next door - Blue Marlin - has tasty food, the black ink risotto, garlic shrimp and crab cakes were all delicious and the service was good all for a reasonable price.

Hotel is boutique and has a nicer feel than a lot of the more dated classics around Waikiki. Location is fantastic. It is close to everything. The beach is a 200m walk. Ross is across the road, H&M on the corner, Victoria Secrets and all the good shops, supermarkets and public transport links are not far away so I think it's hard to find a better location for hotels not on the beachfront! Cheesecake Factory aka Food heaven is pretty much 100m away - location is hard to beat! Check in and check out was smooth, although we had to wait right till 3pm to check in which was a little annoying.. They held our luggage and we could borrow beach towels and use wifi (which is good) etc was cool... The complementary refreshments at reception everyday are a nice touch as is the blackboard next to the elevators with gigs, Island and weather info, cuisine recommendations etc.. We were on the 9th floor. The pictures on the website look very fresh and bright, however, we were a little underwhelmed with how dark he room was. It had, however, a very, very, very comfortable bed and all the features required for a good stay. One gripe I do have is with the Keurig coffee machine in the room. The first coffees were free but after that it was like $2 a pop. I've never liked when hotels do these types of things as they should be replenished every day for free as guests pay per night and for those staying more than one night are not anymore rewarded than someone who stays only one. The water pressure of the shower was pretty weak and our housekeeper (Hong) I think her name was, although she tidied very well came late afternoon most days which after spending the morning out was a bit of a downer returning to a unserviced or currently being serviced room. If you plan on hiring a convertible or jeep wrangler etc there are plenty of rental place near by.. I'd search on Hawaii discount rental cars which had way better rates than the car websites themselves. Parking at the hotel is expensive but no more than other hotels in the area. My advice - hire a car for one day only and save the rip off Waikiki valet fees.. You can see the island in one day. No fitness centre. Rooftop pool is nice and has great views of Waikiki.

She said it was on a higher level, so this might have meant we were slightly upgraded, I can’t be sure. Either way this was hugely appreciated after the long journey! Throughout our stay Monalyn was really friendly (as were the other staff), and always said hi or chatted to us when we passed through the lobby.Free cucumber and mint infused water, and pineapple iced tea was available in the lobby daily. I found the best option was to mix the two. There was also hot tea and coffee available. It’s these small touches that really make a place I think. The room was spacious, clean and had everything we needed (i think it might have been a partial ocean view queen):• Safe• Ironing board and iron• Microwave• Fridge• Wi-fi• Iphone mini-stereo dock• Plenty of hanging closet space (although not many coat hangers)• Coffee maker (but I think the coffee sachets cost money).From our room we got a glimpse of the ocean between two high-rises, which was nice, and were opposite an apartment building (which took some remembering to close the curtains when we got dressed). Location is great! • Lot of restaurants and shops within walking distance• 5-7mins walk to the beach• 5mins walk to food pantry (closest supermarket)• Lots of bus stops around to take you to Pearl Harbour, Diamond and a host of other locations. Note: Given we’re in the centre of Waikiki you can hear the traffic below with or without the door closed, but I didn’t find it to be a major problem when sleeping. Good eats in the area:• For a cheap and tasty meal visit Da Big Kahuna burger 2 mins away• For a healthier meal visit Hide Tide Poke, next door to the hotel.• If you’re looking for musubi or bento box options next door to the hotel (on the other side) is a small place that only accepts cash. I only had a spam musubi from there on my last day but a lot of locals frequented the place. • To save money we bought a lot of microwaveable items and raw foods from the Food Pantry, which is about a 5 minute walk away – this really made for a cheaper stay.• Coco Cove (2mins walk onto Kalakaua) had some great desserts and some decided sushi and salad options if you’re looking for something quick and easy.The only problem with our stay was my allergies. Throughout the stay they settled down (but didn’t go away) as I got more used the environment. I’m not sure what this was due to as the room didn’t smell nor did it appear dirty. I have never had this from any other hotel I’ve stayed at in Waikiki. I mentioned it to the front desk who said they would tell the cleaners to do an extra clean but it didn’t appear to make a difference. My fiancée did not have any problems, so I might just be more sensitive than others.I know they have a pool but we never saw it (too busy elsewhere).","Wellington, New Zealand","ozmericanfran</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",24,4.0

Staff were really nice at the front desk. The pool was really cute (OK so Sheraton pool had the sunset views but who wants that many people to swim with!) and had a cool view. Rarely any people up there as they don't advertise it very much, which was fine by me! The only complaint I had is that they closed the pool for an ENTIRE 24 hours, my last day, for cleaning. I understand pools need cleaning and that's cool, but closing it for a whole day on a Saturday seems like bad timing. It's a roof top pool so surely they could have done it at night to minimise impact. I know it's a not a huge deal but on my last day I really just wanted to chill out and use the hotel facilities. Who knows, someone could have 'soiled' the pool in which case that's fine I understand! I liked this place a lot for convenience, cleanliness and the staff. Would stay here again if they had a good deal, but even though for Waikiki it's 'good' value, they could do a little more for $170/$180 a night. Very little info given at check in for example, and I had read online that breakfast was to be included from September 2014 but heard nothing about it when I checked in so assumed it wasn't. Definitely a good experience but room for a little improvement. Can't beat this place for location to restaurants and shopping. I was also pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was considering the location. I was on the 5th floor and only heard noise when the buses started rolling in at 8am- but I was up by then anyway.

The Ross shop across the road was also very convenient when we needed to buy an extra suitcase for our trip home!We were able to walk to Ala Moana as well as Diamond Head Crater from the hotel, only taking the buses a few times to go further afield (to Waikele Outlets and airport - and to get back from Diamond Head trek!).I chose this hotel because it also had a pool, although I didn't have high expectations for it..so was not too disappointed, and did actually hop into once. It is very basic and kind of odd, climbing up stairs onto the rooftop. Good views of the Royal Hawaiian though!The staff were friendly, and we loved the water/cool drinks in the lobby. The restaurant next door was being renovated while we were there, although did look to be reopening on one of the evenings as there was small party there.We stayed on the 8th floor, and found the room to be quiet although the air conditioning was quite loud. Our room wifi didn't work, so I picked another room number and was able to use that!Probably the biggest disappointment was that we had a small room with two double beds. This trip was to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary, so it was not very romantic! We didn't want to cause any bother so did not ask to be changed, we felt quite lucky to have a balcony and be on a higher floor. But it was a bit of a downer after 3 weeks in the USA with huge beds in the 3 other hotels we stayed in. It was also difficult to find anywhere for all the suitcases since the two beds took up most of the floor space. And they are fixed to the wall board, so you can't push them together in case you are wondering.It did live up to my expectations in other ways too, we really didn't want to stay in one of the big resorts and like to do our own thing, so it was a good base for this, no bellhops or airs and graces, just polite service with a smile.We would stay here again, but probably as a family rather than a romantic getaway.","Christchurch, New Zealand","Flanges</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Christchurch, New Zealand</strong>",12,3.0

The room was not super large (king bed however) but comfortable with a very small balcony that helped make it feel more roomy. The bathroom was small but again adequate for a few days. Most important thing was the room and bathroom were clean! We were fortunate enough to get a microwave and refrigerator in our room ( this was important to us) on the 8th floor. I was concerned that it would be noisy on a lower floor but it was not. We appreciated the complimentary papers , apples and tea/water they provided each day. Valet was a nuisance (we self park usually) and expensive but offset by a great room rate and we never had to wait more than a few minutes for the car. We didn't use the pool - its on top of the building but it is tiny and ok for a quick dip or sun bathing convenient if you don't like the beach. Honestly if we had more time this would have been a problem for me since I like sun bathing and relaxing at a nice pool. This property does not have a fitness center - they will happily point in the right direction to find one but this is very unclear.

And they offered me sheets and extra blanket, but my son would have to sleep on the floor. We ended up buying a inflatable bed from a shopping center. The hotel has a old musky smell to it.

The location of the hotel is great: only a two minute walk to the beach and less to many stores and restaurants in the busy Waikiki area. Close proximity to stops for The Bus, Hawaii's fantastic public transport, is another bonus. Whilst our room was quite small, we weren't fussed as we were basically only in it to sleep or shower. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was stocked with good quality toiletries which were replenished every day. As others have noted, views from the hotel aren't great but we were aware of this when we booked and who cares when a short walk gets you to the beautiful beach anyway! My daughter enjoyed the iced tea and iced mint and cucumber water which was freely available in the lobby everyday and we also utilised the free daily newspaper which was also available. We found the staff very helpful and always courteous and friendly. This hotel is NOT a resort: if you want luxurious lobbies and lush pool areas there are many available in Waikiki but NOT at the very reasonable price we paid.

Friendly staff happy to help you. The hotel has pluses and minuses which may help you decide when booking:- Rooms and bathrooms are small and only a queen bed in standard room. We were on the 10th floor, it had a partial sea view although we only paid for a 'city view' and to be honest you don't stay here for the views as the other tower blocks each side of the hotel aren't great to look at as other reviews suggest. Less pigeon poop viewable on the higher floors it seems... - The reception area is contemporary and clean and while the rest of the hotel is clean it is aging - carpets on the hall ways are going thin and could do with a renovation along with those in the bedrooms. - We were here for 3 nights just to visit Oahu before going onto Maui for a proper beach rest. The Hyatt in Maui at a 4 star made me question whether the Shoreline is even a 3 star...- Pool on roof is very small and ok for a dip as only 6 loungers - you certainly wouldn't want to spend the day up there listening to the hum of the air con and kitchen extractor!+ Free coffee and tea and water in reception 2 computers which allow you to print boarding cards for free is a nice touch. There is also free wifi in the rooms- Cleaner came at 830 one morning rather early for holiday resort, they also undertook routine maintenance on the water system at 915 so my shower went out!+ Reception give you beach towels if you ask+ Close to main strip of the beach and shopping centre also a Starbucks and McDonalds up road, island coffee down road across the Main Street+ Udon noodle bar up the road is well worth the wait as the queue moves fast - see my other review. - My only issue is as it isn't on the beach if you want a lounger you have to pay a heavy price $45-60 to rent 2 beds and an umbrella per day! Check prices of the beach hotels or those with bigger pools as if you are staying more than a few days it may work out cheaper if you can avoid he rental cost of using the beach.

I love the concept of taking older hotels and making them hip, trendy, and cool. They did a great job on the Shoreline and it feels like you are in South Beach Miami versus Waikiki (not a bad thing!). I was only at the hotel for about 12 hours before catching a flight so I don't have a very thorough review but I did enjoy my short time here.Check in was very pleasant and the young woman working the front desk was personable, cool, and fun to talk to. I had parked my car in the incredibly tiny valet area and no one came out. Come to find out that there were no spots left and I would have to park across the street at a pay garage. The nice valet guy backed my car out (it is scary!) for me and I went about my way across the street. It actually worked out very nicely as it was $15 to park as I was out by 6am the next day. Hotel valet is limited and $28 a night.Being a Joy of Life member has its perks as they sent a free bottle of wine to the room! A very nice touch. The room itself was small (queen bed) but for the price it was a good deal in Waikiki. It was very hip and trendy and the furnishings were quite nice. The bed was ""ok"" and comfortable enough. The bathroom was fine although the towels were terrible. They were think, scratchy, and left pieces in my hair. Please get some new towels! There are patios on each room and I was somehow lucky enough to get a HUGE patio on the 13th floor. I didn't get too much of a chance to use it but it was a nice touch. internet is free and they have a pool on the roof but I did not see it.

I definitely have mixed feelings about this place.The location is great, we were super close to Royal Hawaiian Center and Island Vintage Coffee, and it was super convenient for walking the strip (although now that International Marketplace is closed, Waikiki is really not the same). We had a Partial Ocean View King room, and stayed in a corner room on the 13th floor. I'm still used to the taboo against 13th floors in hotel rooms, so that was a little scary (ha). Immediately when we got to the room I looked for the microwave and fridge, which was a necessity to me when I was looking for a hotel. Apparently not all of the rooms in this hotel have them (which to me is ridiculous, why don't you just put them in all the rooms?) and I was told to just hang out in the room for a bit until they figured out a solution. That was a pain, since the last thing we wanted to do was sit around in the hotel room (especially since we wanted to EAT). After waiting for a while and getting antsy cuz we wanted to leave, I followed up on the micro situation and was told they didn't have any other rooms in the category I booked, and if I needed to store something perishable I would be able to use the staff fridge. That's super inconvenient, if I was still a nursing mom and had to store breastmilk, the last thing I'd want to do is trek down to the lobby to store my milk. Thank goodness my son is older now and it wasn't a requirement, but it was definitely an inconvenience, and will surely factor into the decision for a hotel during our next stay.My husband felt like our room was probably converted from a storage room. He didn't like the fact that the bed faced the door. Also, one of our two sliding doors' locks were broken and we had to wait for maintenance to come fix it before I was comfortable enough to leave. We also had a huge patio, but only one chair. The hotel should definitely look into making better use of that huge space. Most of the other rooms have really small lanais that would only fit one chair so it makes sense. But for the two rooms (that I could see) on my floor that have the huge lanais, put more stuff out there so the space can actually be put to use. Stupid thing that I do is check out other rooms when housekeeping is cleaning them. The room across the hall from us had a microwave. Stupid gripe maybe, but since I was specifically wanting a room with one, I was annoyed. Also, the bed wasn't facing the door. If we had gotten that room I would have been happier, but it probably didn't have our partial ocean view.The building directly next door to Shoreline was gross. When standing at the edge of our lanai, and looking over, you see an old decrepit building with bird poop everywhere. We didn't use our lanai much due to lack of furniture and the gross building.There was also construction going on, and the little alley leading to valet parking would be partially blocked a lot. This caused several occasions where super duper car maneuvering was required. It was pretty annoying, but I'm sure it's nothing the hotel can control.Our AC also wasn't working the first day. I had to have front desk folks come in at 11:30 pm to fix it. While my son was sleeping and sweating. Another annoyance.One of the valet guys also rarely ever smiled. Pineapple iced tea in the lobby was great though :).Overall, it was an OK stay. Location was the number one best thing. There aren't any dresser drawers to unpack your stuff, so we were literally living out of suitcases. And having to shove suitcases out of the way when I was done digging clothes out of them. I probably won't stay here again when there are so many other options in Waikiki with all of the things my family needs.","Vallejo, California","mommyreeze</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vallejo, California</strong>",18,3.0

I did not plan to use a rental car, & I did not want a spectacular view of Waikiki, as I planned on being out & about most of the time. I was given a 9th floor room with a view of a rundown building next door, but that was the only downside of the stay. I was out all day, & most evenings, so the view was not my priority. Note: If you are a light sleeper, get a higher floor. This is a city, and yes, if you leave the lanai door open, you will hear a city at night, replete with the evil truck beepers.The room was quite clean, and details like baseboards & doorjambs also showed evidence of frequent cleaning. Bath amenities were by Lather, and I had enough good quality towels. A thoughtful touch was a makeup remover packet. However, I did indulge in buying skincare from Nature Republic, a Korean cosmetics retail store in the Hyatt Regency, so I will not rate the hotel's products. I found the staff surprisingly pleasant, everyone at least acknowledged me in hallways or common areas with a smile or a hello, usually both. Front desk staff was informative, and did not act in an overbearing manner at all. The lobby area was nicely decorated, and had a funky retro vibe that I liked, and the whole hotel seemed rather refreshing after the many typical 'Hawaiian' suites I've stayed in before. The cucumber mint H2O & Plantation pineapple iced tea in the lobby were again a thoughtful touch, and a gentle reminder to hydrate yourself in a tropical environment. Heavenly was a small breakfast & lunch place next door, and the food was nicely health oriented & close by. however, it was rather pricey at $15 per entrée. I found an inexpensive local diner called Seaside a block away and had basic breakfast for $4.95 to $7.95. I was really pleased with the location, I could walk or trolley/da bus/cab to just about anywhere on the strip easily. Royal Hawaiian shopping was at the end of the block, and behind that, the Pink Palace & Sheraton Waikiki, then the beach.However, be adventurous, and look around the mauka side of the Waikiki strip on Kuhio & around Alawai canal. I found Thai Massage at Aisawan for half the price of the spas, I ate Korean BBQ at Hawaii 678 ( oh, pretty Kpop boys serve you, girls!) , Japanese Udon at Marukame, drank $5 maitais at Arnold's, $2 draft beer at the Tiki Bar ( Marriott?), and made an absolute pig of myself chowing plate lunch at the Rainbow Diner for $9.50. There was also a Keurig, a microwave & small refrigerator in the room, which I used for breakfast food and late night snacks. Food Pantry is on Kuhio, 2 blocks East of Seaside ave. Yes, food is pricey compared to mainland, but again, step out of the box & try some local stuff. Why pay $6.95 to a restaurant for a papaya 1/2 with yogurt & granola, when you can just as easily buy the same and eat at least twice? I might mention here that there are several places that are geared to Japanese tourists in the immediate area, but don't be afraid - try them. and most folks were quite interested in talking to me at the local Japanese bars, provided I behaved with good manners and said a few words in Japanese 1st. To sum up, I would certainly stay here again, and I do recommend it, if you know Waikiki already, as I do. No, I am a native at all, I Just have travelled in the islands a lot.

However, we would have been perfectly happy staying at Shoreline! Hilton Waikiki Beach says, ""No resort fees!"" Well, there may not be resort fees, but there are fees for everything else, including internet. But guess what? You get free internet at Shoreline! Shoreline is probably at least $100-$200 less than the Hilton. The rooms are much smaller at Shoreline and I do wish the bathroom was bigger (bathroom at Hilton was pretty incredible), but the air conditioner at Shoreline worked fantastic and so did the little fridge! (We had to have someone override a setting on our AC at the Hilton because no matter what we did, it wouldn't get cool enough, and we also had them bring in an old fridge because, for some reason, they replaced their ""old"" ones with updated ones that barely keep anything cool - we weren't even sure it was working at all!) The guy who brought the fridge in and changed the AC at the Hilton was super nice, but you would think for the price you pay to stay there, that stuff would work great! Plus, he even said when he brought a different fridge to us that the new ones they have don't keep your drinks cold (what's the point, then?). I want anything I put in there to be cold.

Lovely, modern hotel in a great location. Close to all the shops and just a 5-10 minute stroll down to Waikiki Beach. Staff were lovely too - we'd pre-booked a Pearl Harbor tour and got ourselves confused with pick up points and timings but the hotel reception called the company and sorted it all out for us, no problem. We had a late flight on the day of checkout so we were allowed to leave our suitcases in their luggage room, we came back to find my partner had left a pair of shoes in our room (!!) and they were bagged up on our suitcases along with a little note :-) A nice touch in the rooms were magnets with snippets of Hawaiian on them and a 'Hawaiian word of the day' on the chalkboard in the hotel lobby every morning.

Hotel was centrally located to everything on Waikaki. Hotel was clean and inviting as advertised. Room was small, which was expected, but well laid out and appointed. Even though it was small it was not to small for the two of us. Bathroom was clean and provided good supplies, but was the one part of the hotel/room that showed some wear and age around the edges. Though nothing bad. My room also had a small mini fridge which was appreciated. House keeping service was wonderful and friendly. Not pushy like some hotels where they try to make you leave your room when ""they"" are ready to clean. Brenda was nice and said ok, I will come back later, please take your time.Hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. I arrive early since I took the red eye from Fairbanks, AK. It was about 10 am when I arrived and Monalyn at the front desk was gracious and kind to find a room that was ready for us, even though we were very early. Once we got settled in our room Mona also called quickly to check up to make sure we had everything we needed. Mona was exceptionally nice and helpful the whole time we were there. She is def. 5 stars! The bell staff was also good about letting us check our baggage on our last day, as our flight was not until 10pm and were helpful in assisting us with transportation back to the airport.I will stay here again if my travels take me back to Waikaki.

Was informed by Jerome that taking key from room is hotel policy if room key was left in wall as an energy savings. I asked why key wasn't simply left on table or near phone. He then showed me a handful of keys that had been removed from other rooms in the same fashion for the same reason. I was still concerned as have never had such a thing done before. Was told that this is 'policy' and if I didn't like it I could leave hotel.Tried to check out, as Jerome recommended, but was told that now the 3rd party booking agent would have final say in reimbursement (or not).

Many tours stop off anfd pick up opposite the hotel too which is a big plus for getting out and about to see all the sights.The hotel itself is relatively small (compared to most in Waikiki!) which works to its advantage! The staff are amazing and couldn't do enough to help you, adding to the personal touch of the hotel. We originally were put into a room next to the lift which, being a light sleeper at the best of times, was horrendously noisy. I explained my discomfort to the reception staff and immediately they put us in another room - smaller but away from the lifts. As a result I had 3 great nights sleep despite being in the centre of the Waikiki area! Such is the dedication from the staff to ensuring your comfort. In the hotel itself I particularly liked the free amenities such as Wi-fi, the in room coffee machine and cold lemonade and tea/coffee downstairs in the lobby.

The hotel is quite small, meaning that you get the personal touch from the very friendly and helpful staff. We were surprised and pleased to find a welcome gift in the room for our honeymoon – a bottle of rum and mai tai mixer. The rooms are on the small side (although I believe this is common to all Waikiki hotels – much like New York), but reasonably well appointed and we had a superb balcony overlooking the street. Considering how busy Waikiki is, we had no issues with street noise. The WiFi is free and reliable. Coffee and free lemonade in lobby and free beach towels are a nice touch.Although we appreciate that Waikiki is an expensive place to park, we thought that $28 per night is somewhat steep.

The room was very comfortable with a small balcony from where you can catch a glimpse of the sea and the hills, and a good desk where I was able to get some work done.

There was one small drawback in that the air conditioning in the room is directed straight at the bed and I would have preferred having indirect cooling as I am not used to air conditioning.

It's about a 7-10 minute walk to the beach through the Royal Hawaiian Shopping center. This is not a resort hotel, and you won't be choosing between an ocean or a garden view room. Don't let this deter you - you're unlikely to be spending much time in your room anyway - for heaven's sakes, if you're staying here you're in Hawai'i!! I chose this hotel because the reviews said the beds were comfortable and I was in town on business. The beds ARE comfortable. The rooms are small, rather dark, and there is not much special about the property. The hotel is clean and the prices tend to be very competitive for this area of Waikiki. There is a pool on the roof that one of the guests I saw joked was a ""communal bathtub."" But, again, it's Hawaii - you should be at the beach if you want to swim. :)The people at the front desk are very helpful and friendly. I stayed a total of 5 nights and would stay here again. The property is close to everything - bus lines (very easy to get around Honolulu on the buses), wonderful restaurants, world class shopping (including the Ross Dress For Less right across the street)j, and the beach. The front desk staff can hook you up for much of what you'll need in terms of activities, short term car rentals, etc. I do have a number of tips for those considering this hotel. First, if you're a coffee drinker know that there is always coffee in the lobby. There are Keurig's in the room, but after check in they will charge you $2.00 per pod. So, either plan on walking down to the lobby or bring some pods along. Second, be very wary of rooms ending in 28. They are larger than the others, but share an entire wall with the elevators. If you're a light sleeper you're not going to want to listen to the elevator workings when you're in the room. Third, there is often a bowl of apples in the lobby, but no restaurant currently on the property. But, check out the amazing closet sized Bento and Misubi place next door - it's amazing.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Where2GoWhere2go</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",77,4.0

The staff was always very welcoming, helped us find dinner options, transportation suggestions and other general questions. The hotel's location is great. 1 block behind the main Kalakaua Ave, which is where all the restaurants, shopping and way to Waikiki beach is. It was also very good for public transportation, both on Kalakaua Ave and Kuhio Ave, on both ends of the island. We used the Bus system a lot and it was worth it because the roads can be packed with cars and finding parking (and paying for it) can be time and money consuming. We only needed the rental car for 2 days that we spent driving to the far east and north part of Oahu.Back to the Shoreline hotel- the room was always clean and we even received a call that asks us if we would like cleaning anyway in one of the days that we had the ""do not disturb sign"" left on our door. The bed and pillows were one of the most comfortable I had, and I have to note that I suffer from back condition and travel a lot so...We didn't notice any of the construction around, although it was written in a note that waited for us in the room. We came back around 6-7 p.m. every day and I guess they were already done (3rd floor).I know that I'm not the usual leisure traveler to Hawaii, but I really don't see any point paying for those big resort style hotels when I'm out all day and all I need is a good bed and clean shower, and I definitely found that in Shoreline hotel!","Israel, Jerusalem","amiroi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Israel, Jerusalem</strong>",237,5.0

We quickly solved that by not looking out the window anymore. Bed was very comfortable.

There is a timer on the screen, letting you know how long you have been on-line. It cost $4.95 for each additional 20 minutes. Each page you print is 29 cents added to your credit card. ($1 minimum)Every time we travel to Honolulu, we buy the Entertainment Book in advance. We received many of our meals for free or half off. You can print additional coupons on-line using the computer center at the hotel. We left the book with our son and daughter-in-law when we returned home. They live in Honolulu. You can always give it to the staff at Shoreline. They were great and VERY friendly.Another way to cut cost is to join the birthday clubs at different restaurants. They always give you something free for joining. We just list the local restaurant as our favorite location.Shoreline could be the first hotel we return to.

We chose it over a condo because of the reviews which raved about the comfy beds, great showers, courteous staff and cleanliness of the hotel. They're all wrong. My request for a room not facing Seaside Ave. wasn't honored but it was quiet enough, even being on the fifth floor. Most of the renovations were being done in the daytime which didn't disturb our sleep. Unfortunately, it was all downhill after check in. The bathroom wasn't very clean when we arrived to our room. There was a light ring in the tub and a few hairs on the bathroom door. The toilet had some black stuff under the rim Housekeeping came up with a dry towel. He wiped the toilet, then the tub (with the same towel) and said it was 'just stains.' The next day, we got to the room at 3pm and our room still hadn't been cleaned. We were told they had until 5 so we sat on the balcony while they cleaned. Cleaning consists of a light spray of the bathroom, making the bed, changing the towels and emptying the trash. They don't vacuum the sand from the carpet or thoroughly sweep the bathroom. They also don't change the sheets (we marked the inside of the sheet with a pen just as a joke). The cleaning staff also smokes on the balcony. We found an empty pack of cigarettes and butts on there our second day. The customer service was almost as abysmal as the cleaning. When they didn't clean our tub at all one day, the manager Jerome asked 'What do you want me to do about it?' I asked him to send someone to clean it. He didn't until I made a second phone call hours later. He said it was 'mis-communication.' Another day they took our towels and didn't leave any washcloths. The front desk clerk Kristy sent someone up quickly but was very dismissive like I was bothering her. The best thing about this hotel is the location but if you have Gucci and Prada money, you wouldn't stay here. The balcony is large but you may be greeted by a whiff of smoke from the guest next door. As you know, there are no dressers or tables and chairs. There are a few drawers though and our King city view room was larger than I thought. The bed is right next to the bathroom and there's no vent in there. The valet guys were nice as was Aly at the front desk. The lemon water was a welcome touch but I'd rather be greeted with a smile instead of being treated like a burden.

I really was impressed with this property everything from the cleanliness and appearance of common areas and Lobby, to the Staff's knowledge of hotel and facilities in addition to their knowledge of surrounding area. I found the rooms to be on the smaller side but the overall condition of guest room and furnishings more than made up for it. My wife was impressed with the cleanliness of both the room and the bathroom. I found the room to have proper functioning room technologies (television, entertainment, telephone and WIFI). The best part was the comfortable bed. I did not get a chance to use the fitness center so I cannot comment on the facility. For the price you cannot beat this hotel. So what are the cons? The only thing I wish this hotel had was a restaurant and bar. Having said that there were plenty of places to go within walking distance. The beach is close by and my wife enjoyed her stay here. I would recommend this property to family and friends.","Mountain Top, Pennsylvania","Kris M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mountain Top, Pennsylvania</strong>",20,4.0

We chose this place based on our past positive experiences with his hotel chain and it's convenient location.The check-in was smooth. Loved how the lobby always had the 24hr beverage stations as well as apples and newspapers. Shout out to Tyson from Dana Pointe at the front desk who was not only friendly and knowledgeable, but was breaking a sweat from multitasking whenever we saw him.The room we got was a standard. So definitely not much room to move about, but still very modern and hip. I really like how the have energy saver air conditioner using your hotel key. The toiletries are of good quality as usual and you get a real hair dryer to use.Note there is no gym here. There is a pool on the rooftop, but we did not use since the beach was close by.The hotel is very central to all the shopping. No need really to rent a car if you aren't planning to venture far from Waikiki beach. Just steps away from the hotel is a small japanese cafe/convenience store Masubi Cafe.

The hotel and room were clean and modern with more than enough room for us with our travel and plenty of shopping bags! The location is off the main ""strip"" but only by a few shops, and it was nice to be away from the traffic and hustle. The hotel was close to the main bus stops to all the popular island destinations plus fantastic food options and of course right across the road from Ross for Less! (a must for anyone looking for great value shopping!). We requested a higher floor as it was our anniversary and the hotel obliged by putting us on the 10th floor and even surprised us on our first night with a complimentary bottle of wine! The front desk staff were exceptional, providing us numerous maps and hints and tips to get around the island, including organising our early morning check in (after our flight landed well before check in time) and arranging our taxi on departure. Only negative is delivery trucks on the street can be noisy early in the morning, but not controllable by the hotel and suspect noise would be worse on the ""strip"" and in a hotel with a lot more guests on each floor ( we didn't hear our neighbours at all - which was nice).If you are looking for fantastic value, modern clean rooms, great location and friendly staff - this is your place!

We spent our last 2 nights in Hawaii at The Shoreline, and unseasoned travellers as we are, found this a perfect place. On arrival the porter Sonny was helpful and friendly caring well with our luggage. Unfortunately the little outside lift for people with disabilities was not working. However the steps to the hotel were wide and shallow with sturdy handrails so I was able to get up with minimal difficulty and I could use my walking frame from there.  On arrival at the reception the two lovely ladies there made us very welcome and seeing I had a mobility issue changed our room to a disability unit. We had close relatives also staying and the ladies advised us which room they were in - not far from us on the 13th floor. These ladies were on the desk both evenings and were helpful and interested in our activities also providing directions and helpful hints for our sightseeing. The room was spacious and well set out, the bathroom had a 'wet floor' shower with a folding seat attached to the wall, rails where needed and everything was spotlessly clean. The little balcony had beautiful views of the sea and the city and we enjoyed sitting out there just looking at the ever changing scenery. There was a slight ridge (over which I had to step very carefully)where the sliding doors led out to the balcony and only 1 chair, but my walking frame had a seat on it was no problem. Our wakeup call the next morning was on time and courteous. The room was quiet and the air conditioning unit appreciated. The other couple also commented on the spotless state of their room, and although they didn't have a sea view enjoyed their city skyline. The foyer was spacious and welcoming. We did not use the fitness centre or swimming pool, so cannot comment on that. Being a plain tea drinker I did miss my tea bags thought there were plenty of herbal teas available in the foyer.

Last year, also over the Easter Holidays, I stayed at the other Joie de Vivre Hotel in Hawaii – Coconut Waikiki Hotel – and I have no hesitation in saying that while they are both well priced for Waikiki, the Shoreline Hotel Waikiki is the better of the two properties.I booked a “City View Queen” at the amazing price of $98 per night (plus tax). Upon my arrival, I was informed that I had been upgraded to a “City View King” at no extra cost. Although small, room 622 was clean and the King size mattress was firm but very comfortable. Bed linens and towels were adequate, the small bar fridge was a welcome appliance, and electrical plug ins were plentiful. The small flat screen television did not provide high definition programing (almost hard to believe in today’s world of inexpensive large screen, high definition televisions), but the free internet more than made up for the lack of proper television. The room does have a safe, ironing board, iron and hair blow dryer. Spoiler Alert: the Shoreline Hotel Waikiki is not a “high end property”, but it is well situated and provides everything one needs for a budget Waikiki experience. There is a very small rooftop pool, there are three community computers available for patrons to use in the lobby area, and the lobby itself is fairly small, simple, and underutilized. You can walk easily to everything in Waikiki, and you’re just a five minute walk to the famous Waikiki and Kuhio beaches. Restaurants, coffee shops (there is a Starbucks across the street), ABC convenience stores, banks, major transit lines, and retail therapy are all just a few steps away.On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is terrible and 10 is excellent, I rank the Shoreline Hotel Waikiki as a solid 8 and I highly recommend it. There is nothing wrong with spending $500 per night for a beach front hotel experience if that’s your thing. It’s just that most of us like the extra coin in our bank accounts, and the two Joie de Vivre Hotels in Hawaii go a long way towards preserving one’s bank account.","surrey, british columbia","carfaxdave</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>surrey, british columbia</strong>",332,5.0

I have to say that was a great decision. From the moment we arrived a the hotel we were greeted very attentively by all the friendly staff. Love the personal touch when they wrote our names on the chalk board on the day we arrived.We were traveling for the first time with our young infant so we had a number of requests at the time we were booking a room. We had heard about the noise levels if we were on lower floors so requested higher floor, trying to avoid noise from down below. We also needed a microwave and fridge for our baby food prep. Person we spoke to on the phone was very accommodating and we got everything we had asked for. We ended on the 10th floor facing the beach. Unfortunately at that level, we were really facing a car park. At the end of the day it was fine, because it was hard enough to find the right room with all the unique requests we had. We also had no problem with any noise since we were higher and facing away from the main roads. This was key to ensuring our baby slept through the night and she did!Rooms were quite clean and really met our expectations. Location really is great and central to just about everything. Wasn't too hard to make a B-line to our hotel room in case of any baby emergency or just needing a pit stop.Overall we really enjoyed the stay as we were there for 11 days. While the hotel has been renovated and has that boutique feel to it, the staff really made all the difference. They would ask you about your day and just have friendly conversations and even provide helpful advice and tips. Everyone was just so accommodating and willing to help out. I just wanted to specifically thank Christy, Sonny, Tyson, Alex, and Dustin for all their efforts in creating a wonderful vacation experience for us. It obviously left an impression on us.With such great care and attention to the customer experience it's really going to be difficult for me not to return to this hotel the next time I have a chance to go to Waikiki!","Vancouver, Canada","vulture604</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",16,4.0

We received fresh towels every day (even though we didn't actually put our used ones on the floor), and the a/c was quiet.

We have booked three rooms (11th,12th and 13th floor). All rooms were King Rooms, they looked pretty much the same and had similar views. Despite good rating I give, I can't really think of any strong and obvious pros of this hotel besides it's value. We liked a bed which was very comfortable, location and a big TV - thats it. Shoreline Waikiki is a typical medium class US hotel and you just shouldn't expect too much of those. We had a quite clean and spacy room but our balcony was a total mess - a load of dirty concrete with water puddles after rain and a view reminding Hongkong. Advertised partial ocean view is an exaggeration as one can see only a little bit of water between buildings. There are sliding glass doors between the room and the balcony. Unfortunately locks on both were rusty and one didn't even work properly. Considering how close our balcony was to others we decided not to leave valuables inside the room. Bathroom was small and needed renovating not to mention stuck drain in the sink. But one thing I remember the most was air conditioning - complete disaster. The unit was placed exactly next to the bed. After switching on we felt like inside a freezer as cold air blew directly into us. Moreover the temperature was regulated by a long very cold and loud air bursts. They lasted for 10-20 minutes and paused for another 10-20mins. The only way to sleep was to open the sliding door and hope that noone will enter. We had to bare city noise of course having balcony opened. It was not that bad but we don't know how it would have been if we chose a room on lower floor. Shoreline doesn't have any restaurant or bar. It also does not have a parking but one can have his car parked at a parking lot across the street (20$ a day plus valet). Location is rather OK. Waikiki can be reached within 5 minutes by foot. If you drive to Shoreline for the first time get a good look on the map. There is a lot of one way streets and it is easy to get lost. I think this hotel deserves good rating because it has considerably good location compared to the price.","Wroclaw, Poland","pilotnik</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wroclaw, Poland</strong>",15,4.0

Overall experience was excellent. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful everyday. The size of the junior suites was more than adequate. Yes the 13th floor suites do not have lanais except for the end king view rooms that have the only huge lanais on the property. The 13th floor has a 'Juliette' style balcony that was more than adequate for us - being somewhat acrophobic the thought of spending massive amounts of time on a slab of concrete jutting out from the building is not my idea of vacation time. As for the negative comments in other reviews, all I can say is that this was not our experience. If you want a room with a view of something other than another building (which is the norm in Waikiki) then book (and obviously pay for) a room on the higher floors. Our suite was well designed, had a fridge, coffee maker, etc and excellent Wi-Fi. The bathroom was large - and did not have the toilet in the shower. The products supplied by the hotel were very nice.The only negative I might point out is that the rooms do not have any sort of dressers in which to put your clothes. However, the closets are huge. In the suite there were 2 full double closets which had shelving units inside that provided more than adequate space. There was a lack of sufficient hangers in the room but one quick call to the front desk immediately solved that problem. So, overall it was an excellent vacation.

We booked through their website and got us a Partial Ocean View King ADA room which says on the email we received in confirmation:""includes a... balcony/lanai, refrigerator, microwave...""When we got to our room on the 14th floor, we noticed that there was no microwave or fridge. The balcony was only for one person to stand on (why bother having one?) so I went down to the reception to ask if there was another room available that would actually match what we booked. I even brought our print out. There were 2 people at reception and there were both confused at the simple request. The unhelpful lady goes, ""Is this something you think you would require?"". Um, excuse me... I require what I paid for. It's like asking someone who booked into a resort if they require a pool. I was gobsmacked and said yes. She said no rooms were available until about 4 days into our trip. By then what's the point? I told her that she should tell management to change the description of the ADA rooms in their website and take off the fridge/microwave description and she just looked at me with a blank look on her face clearly just having failed Customer Service 101. The room we had was average sized. The king bed was very comfortable which is a plus and so are the pillows. The bathrooms are poorly designed (read: cheap) so that the shower is in the same area as the toilet. I believe another reviewer also commented about this being a poor design and I agree. Everything got wet basically. I sleep with earplugs on so the noise didn't bother me but if you're light-sensitive then please bring an eye mask. With all the lights off in the room, it was still bright. Again, poor design. The bed was facing the door directly and there were large gaps in the bottom and side of the door so the orange flourescent lighting from the hallway seeps into the room casting an orange glow all night. The airconditioning is also very loud. The pool was again another poor design (I'm just thinking the designers/management are lazy overall). It was just a rectangle of water in a rooftop with 4 plastic chairs. No umbrellas or anything to make it usable for anyone. Why bother?Some pros:- location is brilliant. Only a couple of minutes from Waikiki Beach.- the bed is comfortable- we found the free coffee/water helpful some days- there was one guy in reception that was particularly helpful (male with glasses on, morning shift always)Apart from these pros, there were too many cons especially the afternoon reception staff and their attitudes.

Once settled in to our room, we were pleased all around. The rooms are well-appointed, as are the bathrooms. Our deck was great for watching the Waikiki scene. Nice lobby and extremely helpful staff. Note: Lower floor rooms get noisy at night from the street life. ** Upper floor rooms (1327, 1328, 1427 or 1428) are quieter. ** The hotel is only a block away from Waikiki Beach and great shopping.

After a lot of Trip Advisor research, I decided to book the Shoreline Waikiki.....it was the best choice I could have made.This is a delightful boutique hotel just a short walk from just about everything. I'm guessing it has been renovated in the last few years and is now stylish and modern. The room was a good size with everything you would expect - no musty smell that you get in so many of the other older properties. The staff were extremely polite and helpful - and good advise on restaurants, buses etc. Nothing was too much trouble.We loved the iced water, really good coffee and green tea available 24/7 ini the lobby.There is a samll rooftop pool - nothing flash but good for a quick dip and a fabulous view to the Royal Hawaiian and the ocean.All the local buses and trams stopped just a few metres away.Having looked everywhere for clothing and accessories at a great price we realised we had a Ross's Outlet store literally next to the hotel - and open to 11pm! We did some credit card damage in there!Would definitely stay again and would highly recommend to anyone else heading to Waikiki and not wanting to stay in one of the massive resorts.",Auckland,"Annabel L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland</strong>",11,5.0

I think it's biggest plus is the location - even though it is not ON Waikiki Beach.We encountered the biggest negative of our stay when the airport shuttle dropped us curbside. To our dismay, there was no ramp to tow our wheeled bags to the lobby - we had to carry them up a flight of (low) steps. Not fun after a long & tiring flight.Check-in was uneventful & we were allowed to get into our room early. We got our info for free wifi log-in & really appreciated the elevators to our 5th floor. The view was horrible (the backside of some business building) & we didn't really use the single chair on the small balcony. But I was curious about the pool on the 14th floor ...Again, not much of a view except for the tops of other hotels & other buildings around us. In the distance, maybe a hazy glimpse of the ocean. It was a very basic pool for getting wet, not much space for much else.Our room had a very comfortable bed, a mini-fridge, microwave & coffee-maker. We liked that there was a desk-chair and an arm-chair for two of us to sit on besides the bed. The shower was good & strong, but based on the lack of lather, I suspect the water was ""hard"" (normal for Hawaii?). Quite noise-proof too.Thankfully the hotel had a very detailed map of the surrounding area - restaurants, shopping, hotels, etc. Also details on riding the various public buses/trolleys & how to get to the nearby beach.Across the street, one of the ubiquitous ABC Stores (39 in Waikiki alone) where we shopped for 100% Kona coffee macadamia chocolates & souvenirs. Then we discovered Duke's Marketplace one street over, parallel to ours - a bargainer's joy for haggling over jewelry, handicrafts, etc from the numerous stalls & merchants.Kuhio Avenue is at one end of our Seaside Avenue and it is the cheaper, but no less exciting street than the high-end Kalakaua Avenue. Most buses run both ways on Kuhio so tourists can pretty much go anywhere.Next door to the hotel: an ATM and Starbucks (and another across the street). Opposite direction of Kuhio, cross Kalakaua Avenue, are the hotels that we walked through to get to the beach.As I said, great location - once you get your bearings. Unless you plan on staring at or living on the beach, there really is no need to pay the premium bucks to stay in those hotels. If there was a good price, I wouldn't mind staying here again. We got all our breakfast items at the ABC store & ate in our room everyday, using the microwave.","Chico, California","itchfoot</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chico, California</strong>",70,4.0

The only place to put a second suitcase was on the desk, except that it was loaded with a coffee pot, microwave and condiment tray. The hotel does not offer any food or beverages, and when you arrive you are greeted by 12 steps by which you must haul your luggage up just to get into the building. Location aside, I could have stayed at a real 4 star hotel for what I paid to stay here, and had the amenities that go with it. One Note: When we arrived and found no way to get our luggage up the 12 steps I went into the front desk to inquire if I was in the right place. The desk clerk (Peter) said, well; ""most of the cab drivers know to drop you off at the rear service alley where we have a ramp."" I am sorry, but I am not in the habit of being dropped off at the rear service alley of so called 4 star hotels. I think if you are single this might work for you, but otherwise, I would suggest another place with more room and more amenities. By the way, this hotel does have a handicap lift out front, which looks like a trash compactor, is unmarked except for a small faded sign that says ring bell for service. If you are handicapped, you may check in, but unless they have special rooms for you that are larger, you will never get around the bed or into the bathroom, and I doubt the balcony would hold a wheelchair.","Seattle, Washington","charlesodonnell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",165,2.0

Gorgeous lobby area with freshly brewed coffee and iced water available all day/night and daily newspaper.My queen room was on the 9th floor with a city view facing Lauula Street and overlooking the Marine Surf Condos. Although the room was on the small side, it was perfectly adequate and clean. Comfy bed, lots of pillows and extra bedding in the wardrobe. The balcony was tiny with only one chair, however the view of the city lights at night was really pretty. Room was equipped with TV, ironing board, safe, microwave, coffee maker and in the bathroom hairdryer, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. One issue with the bathroom though ..... remember to keep the door closed as the escaping steam caused the fire alarm to go off!The chalk board in the lobby is a fantastic idea, giving infomation on weather, surf conditions, ""Hawaiian word of the day"" (loved that) and nightly entertainment. Was lucky enough to go see Mike Love (Beach Boys) at the Mai Tai Bar and would not have known if not on the chalk boardComing back to the hotel after a day out was like coming home.

Having read the Trip Advisor reviews before we went, it met our expectations. It is very reasonably priced, and the location in the center of Waikiki, along with the big name hotels. The room was clean. The bed was excellent. The shower was powerful and hot. Daily servicing of the room was just right. The desk staff was young, attentive, knowledgeable, and very nice. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for the things that I just described. I would stay at the Shoreline again.Hotel is just a few blocks from Waikiki beach. The hotel provides free beach towels for you to use. The hotel is just a block from the Royal Hawaiian Center, which is a major shopping and restaurant center. The Royal Hawaiian hotel puts on a free, top-notch Hawaiian music and dance show at the Center five nights a week at 6PM. I believe that each of these free shows is of higher quality than any show you could pay to see on the Island. The Shoreline is only two blocks from Lewers St and one block from Kalikaua Ave, which are major shopping streets. There is also a McDonalds less than a block away. It is easy to get from the Shoreline Hotel to the highways that take you to every part of the island. Recommend you use a GPS for guiding your driving. Trip Advisor reviews of the Shoreline do include a number of reviews which indicate issues exist. Some were due to unrealistic expectations. However, when you go to a restaurant or a hotel, you get a feel for how the hotel management views and implements their role. Same is true for the Shoreline. I noticed a few things that I wondered about, so I asked one of the desk staff who owns the hotel? The answer was surprising, and explanatory. It was: ""The owners of this hotel are anonymous. It is managed by the Joie de Vivre company."" I believe that this explains many of the negative reviews. I politely suggested an improvement to a desk clerk, who politely responded ""That is above my pay grade."" In my nine days at the hotel, I never saw anyone who looked like a manager. The parking situation for the hotel is a problem. It has limited parking spaces. You have to check with the hotel every day to see if they have space for your car. If not, you park across the street, where you pay daily, ONLY IN CASH and no bills larger than a $20. Management should settle which option you will use before you arrive, and if you park across the street, you should be able to pay the hotel, who then pays the other parking garage.Once I asked the desk clerk to change a $100 bill for some $20 bills so I could pay the garage. They didn't have enough twenties to change the $100 bill. I was really surprised by this.Another small but easily fixable problem is that the soap dish by the sink in our room was a simple flat bottomed plastic box with no drain holes or raised bars to keep the soap above the water which drains off a used bar of soap. Thus the bar of soap was always a bit soft. I believe that the issues that I have listed here are easily fixable. I have written them here, not as complaints, but as suggestions for improvement. I would recommend the hotel to others, and would stay there again, even if the small issues were not removed or ameliorated.","Burke, Virginia","Mel M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Burke, Virginia</strong>",179,4.0

My friends can be a bit demanding, however, the staff was able to answer our every request with professionalism and a smile! The location of the hotel was convenient as the beach was easily accessed since we planned to utilize our time tanning and relaxing.You can't match the room rates with the amount of satisfaction we received on our trip!

It is located two blocks back from the Royal Hawaiian- centrally located for the beach, restaurants and shopping. And it was rated #10 in Honolulu at price around $200 for a 'partial ocean view king'. TA rated hotels #1-9 ahead of it ranged in price from $250 to nearly $1000. We felt it was worth a try for 3 days, and we did have a good stay, thank you.The house has a number of features beyond location providing, at least for Waikiki, a reasonable value: medium sized room and bath, complementary internet ( thank you), daily newspaper (in the lobby) and a large flat screen TV with many channels. Everything was very clean and well maintained. Our 13th floor room had a 'partial ocean view' overlooking the Royal Hawaiian and had a huge deck ( a table would have been nice along with the two provided chairs.) The linens, towels and amenities were about normal for this level of house. It had a small refrigerator- would have been nice to have a microwave and coffee service ( complementary coffee in the lobby). The bed was comfortable and the room was pleasantly, if sparsely decorated and furnished.This tendency toward a stark look and feel, minimalist if you will, defines this house. We rated the service as average, although it was actually very good- there just was not much of it. The folks at the front desk and the housekeeping staff is about it- and they did well. Ice is only on the first floor of a 14 story building; coffee and newspapers are complementary but you have to come to the lobby. The exterior and interior colors are so muted as to be nearly monochromatic with just some occasional bright pieces of art. The tiny roof top pool and deck can be a nice escape from the Waikiki circus, but they are just barely big enough to actually exist.You can do better than the Shoreline for a lot more money and you can surely do far worse, but we can recommend this hotel with some small reservations.",,AnacoTraveler,119,4.0

The toilet was in the shower! I complained ( the clerk said ""is that problematic for you?"" ... yes, it was!) and was given a different room on the 9th floor. It was tiny and it had no view (an understatement - it overlooked a semi-abandoned apartment building, the street and several rooftops). It was very noisy. Lots of activity in the apt. building next door and the trucks and buses on Seaside beeped all night long.The negatives: A lot of street noise.For the most part the rooms are very small with unattractive tiny balconies.The pool is a joke - unattractive, cold and dirty.The worst thing:We almost got mugged in front of the hotel at 10:30 PM. Followed very closely and harassed by a young street kid ... I fear something terrible might have happened in another 10-20 feet if we had continued down Seaside Ave any further.Conclusions and advice: Don't expect too much.You can do much better in Waikiki. We got a really good Orbitz price on our room and it still wasn't worth the amount we paid. Ask for a very high floor room (non-handicapped accessible). Expect to be disturbed by street noises.Be careful and be wary of your surroundings at night on the side streets.","Boston, Massachusetts","SunsetPelican</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",72,2.0

Hotel is only a couple of blocks from Waikiki, so terrific location - that is, you are close enough to walk down, but also not right in the centre of it! For those looking for a great pool with bar atmosphere, this is not your place. The pool is on the roof, very small and only about 7 lounge chairs with NO bar. For those who want to go to the beach and frequent the bars on the beach (i.e. us!) this is a great place to stay.

Rooms were average size, but clean. Showers were great - good pressure and nice and hot! As always, if you plan to rent a car, parking charge is $26/night. This is definitely a great alternative if you want to be close to the action, not necessarily in it, and don't want to pay extortionate nightly rates… Truth is, you're in Hawaii, so likely not spending that much in the room to warrant the extortionate rates.

We sat there for about 10mins one day.- Other tourists smoking on the balcony's, forces you to close your door- Tiny room, asked about an upgrade, they said it would be $25 a night extra, we decided to rent a car for 2 days instead ($26 for valet parking...) I think the bigger rooms would be totally worth it.- No ventilation in the bathroom - means that your swimsuits, towels, etc will never get dryOverall:I would stay here again, but only in a bigger king sized room, we didn't have much issue with street noise, I think those complaints always come from people who live in the suburbs and then stay in a downtown area hotel. They are doing construction down the street that involved some late night 'beeping' that was mildly annoying. The walk to the beach is not bad at all, just a few blocks, but it is far enough that you wouldn't want to go back and forth.I wouldn't recommend this hotel for families due to the walk to the beach and the pool, but for couples it was perfect.Tips - McDonald's is just behind the hotel, good for a quick breakfast, it was $40 each way for our taxi, take advantage of all the happy hour food/drink deals down in the beachwalk area (Yard House, Cheeseburgerland, PF Changs) will save you some $ and is only a block away.",Vancouver,"wrldtvler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver</strong>",95,4.0

I had a great experience at the Shorebreak hotel in Huntington Beach which is super modern and beautiful, but this hotel is a far cry from that location. As far as most of the reviews of this Shoreline Waikiki go, everything is fairly accurate about the easiness to the beach and shops. I did have an incident which led me to believe that the hotel wasn't being totally honest with me and after all the accolades of ""exceptional service"" and the manager personally responding to so many Tripadvisor reviews, it was a shame to see this happen.Please note that I did ask for something which was considered an ""extra"", although I have found through extensive travels that people are usually willing to help without resistance. My situation was that it happened to be torrentially raining this one day in Waikiki and my ride to get me was a few hours away. I asked for a late check out. I went to the front desk and asked the agent and he looked at my reservation and told me he was sorry, my room had someone coming in and said that 12:30 would have been the latest he could possibly do (regular checkout at Shoreline is 12pm). I felt he was not being honest as it seemed his response was a bit canned, so about 1/2 an hour later, I came back down again and asked a different guy. He too looked at the reservation and said he could do 1pm without hesitation. So it seems where one guy was willing to extend for another hour and another guy was simply lying to my face to kick me out 1/2 an hour early. I feel almost as important as the great rooms is the integrity of the staff that work at hotels. I just hate being lied to after spending good money in choosing the hotel. Waikiki has many great hotels, some right on the beach. I guess I'm picky but because of this incident and the idea that we vote with our dollars to businesses that we'd like to support, I'd be reluctant to stay here again.

The hotel is super clean, modern and up to date. That it is actually an older building is completely invisible unless you look really hard. The front desk staff are all super nice and accomodating.Valet parking is the way to go. $2/day more than finding your own, the cars are kept right at the back door of the lobby, and a valet was always available. Worth every penny.The rooms are compact to be sure, but hey, you're in Hawaii, and you need to be outdoors! The rooms reminded me a lot of a typical cruise ship in square footage and furnishings, which is a compliment. Like a lot of european hotels, the A/C is controlled by your room key which you insert into the light switch next to the door. Took a moment to figure that out, but once we did, it was nice, helped keep us from losing our key, and I appreciated the energy-conserving feature. Yes, there is a truly crappy building that needs to be torn down/blown up or something next to it, but its hardly a dealbreaker. The rooftop pool is nifty, relatively private and appeared to be as well maintained as the rest of the place. The location is pretty darn awesome for not being on 'the strip'. Short walk to pretty much anything, bus stop on the corner, fun/weird/cheap breakfast place also at corner. There is a bar for anyone's taste or interest within a block or two. Lots of shopping from the lowest to highest end within a block or two. Very eclectic.The attached Mexican restaurant was quite good and reasonably priced.Cab drivers have no idea where this hotel is located. 3 tries, 3 cabs, and they all got lost. Either the recent name change or the one-way street the hotel is on threw them off. We found it more funny than annoying as cabs in Honolulu are plentiful, reasonably priced and driven just as horrifically as in any city.","Steamboat Springs, Colorado","KurtS84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Steamboat Springs, Colorado</strong>",14,5.0

We picked this hotel knowing we wanted something more funky in style, smaller than the usual large chain hotels (no waiting for the lifts), but still in a good location and with free wifi. We also decided to book away from the beachfront to ensure a good night's sleep - it worked. This hotel fit the bill, good value-for-money, and we were not disappointed. In fact, we felt right at home.As with any hotel experience, it's often the ""little"" things... We got what we expected from the suite we booked. It was clean, modern and the size was as expected from our booking - so all fine. What we ""really"" valued was the service - from the front desk, particularly Rommel and Tyson. Whatever we asked, they did their best to answer or offer suggestions, maps etc. The lovely asian guy (sorry I've forgotten his name) who helped with our bags was super helpful as well. And there was an older asian cleaning guy who worked an evening shift during our stay. I think we got back around 2am one morning and he helped fill up the water container with ice and water for us. Thank you so much - we sooooo appreciated it! We also loved the free tea/coffee/water near reception. The wi-fi was good (mainly used this in our room). And we did use the computers/printer to print our boarding passes. All these little things make travelling smooth and easy. Location-wise... the hotel is very conveniently located or sandwiched between Kalakaua Avenue and Kuhio Avenue. It's a couple of blocks to the beach (more depending on which part you want to enjoy), shopping, cafes, restaurants etc. We hit Starbucks a few times during our stay as well as numerous eateries and shops on Kuhio, Kalakaua and also at Ala Moana Shopping Mall and Ward Centre.

Their valet lot holds about 4 cars, so it was always full. We were given a voucher to park in the parkade across the street (for $24/day, which I think is more than the hotel's lot), but everyone seemed to have a different story as to what to do with the voucher, when to pay, whether we'd get towed, etc. It ended up working out fine but if you're the valet guy on duty at the hotel you should probably know what the deal is, and the hotel staff should make sure the people who work at the parkade know what the agreement is with the hotel (one lady told us we'd get towed even if we displayed the voucher).

You can see a bit of the ocean and. The room we had (1327) had a huge deck whereas most of the other rooms only have a small balcony. The room is really small but clean. Couple of stains on the carpet. Nice bathroom but no fan in it so we just kept the door open during baths and showers. Staff was very helpful and friendly! Great location, minutes away from Waikiki beach, Starbucks, the shopping strip etc. A cab ride from the airport to the hotel is about $45. The food at the restaurant ""Cha Cha Cha"" downstairs is really good.Car rental/parking:There is an enterprise rent a car up the street. If you want a Mustang, you better try to reserve one before you get here because they always sell out fast! We had to wait for ours for 2 days. In the meantime, we rented a Jeep Wrangler. The Jeep and the Mustang both go for $150 a day at enterprise. I definitely recommend renting a car to get to the really nice beaches. Waikiki is not bad but it's not my favorite. The hotel charges $24 a day for valet parking. A way better option is to park in the underground parking lot of the Marine Surf Waikiki which is right beside Shoreline for $5 a day. Get in there after 5pm and buy a ticket ($5 bill only, no change at machine) which will say it's good until 2am. It is actually good until about 11am. It just needs to be purchased at or after 5pm and not earlier. Very important, park in a stall that says ``Pay parking``, you will get towed from the other ones. We parked there for a week and it worked out great and saved us a lot of money. If you ever forget to buy your ticket, you will get a warning in form of a green sticker first before they tow you the next time.Definitely go to Kailua/Lanikai beach! My favorite beach! Get a map or google where it is. 35 min drive from the hotel. We just used our IPhone map to get around everywhere. You will first hit Kailua beach which is beautiful and if you keep driving for a minute or two, you will get to Lanikai. Both beaches are super nice! Grab lunch or dinner at Buzz's Original Steakhouse right by Kaliua beach, great food!Hanauma Bay is awesome for snorkeling! You can rent fins, masks and snorkels there, $12 for the set for a day. Admission to Hanauma Bay is $7.50 a person. If the parking lot is full, park down the street by the gas station and take a cab up.The North Shore is beautiful too, we went cage diving with sharks with North Shore Shark Adventures which was amazing!!Definitely enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would come back for sure.","Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada","twooutofthree</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada</strong>",14,4.0

It is very close to all the eateries and shops (including the soon-to-be closed International Markets) along Kalakaua Avenue, as well as Waikiki Beach. The staff are very professional and do their best to make your stay enjoyable. We had 3 rooms booked. We received two room upgrades, which was lovely. When we arrived at 12 noon, they got one room ready so that we could store our luggage in it; we really appreciated that. The rooms were a good size and very clean. We were pleased to find a pool on the top floor, as we had not expected a pool from our research on the hotel facilities. There is free wi-fi in the foyer as well as a computer station.

I was very pleased with the location. It was central to everything. The hotel is located on Seaside and is in between Kalakaua and Kuhio (main streets with lots of shopping). Walking up towards Kalakaua takes you right in front of the grounds in front of the Royal Hawaiian.There are lots of places to eat and it is easy to get to public transit from there. I found Tyson and Kristy to be very helpful with printing out maps for me (for when I rented a car) and for setting up shuttles and helping me figure out the bus schedule.

The hotel itself may not be of the standard of the exotic and famous ones in the area but this is good because there is no confusion, no noise and the atmosphere is very relaxing.The staff at the reception were polite and helpful to the extreme.

Right in the middle of Waikiki, walking distance from everything including public transports which are - to use a typical australian expression - "" a bloody beauty"".The room was comfortable, clean and with a nice view from the 12th floor.If anything the wardrobe was a bit small but when you are happy...................who cares!During our stay we had a small hiccup with the safe. The battery was low and it would not open. We notified reception and within the hour the problem was fixed.

The bed was very comfortable, and the room is well-equipped. There was a bottle of red wine awaiting us in our room as well, along with a hand-written note welcoming us to the hotel. The staff was very friendly and responded to every request we had with charm. The valet staff was quick and responsive. (Note that you have to use the valet because street parking in Waikiki is pretty much non-existent; the rates are reasonable for the area.) The hotel also provides a list of TheBus routes to take to various attractions around Honolulu and O'ahu, so it's even possible to eschew a car for a trip. If there's any negative, the access to the swimming pool is not well-signed, and is not accessible via elevator; you have to climb a couple of flights of stairs from the 14th (top) floor to get to it.

It's not a luxury establishment, and so it's a great way to save some money if you are on a budget, but are a long way from backpacking. I loved the cute furniture and decor. The only disappointing thing to me was the lanai, which was super tiny and not at all private, so it wasn't something I used.I also really appreciated the beach towel borrowing system, where you can borrow and then return your beach towel, all from the front desk (which saves dragging in sand and is free!

After spending 2 weeks in a really quiet , remote and large cottage in Kauai we were concerned that this part of the holiday may not be as comfortable or enjoyable but we were wrong. This place was great in its own way. The first thing we noticed was the awesome lobby. It is really trendy and fresh and made a great first impression. Next the staff... So professional! No pretension - just quiet, polite and friendly people - all of them. They checked us in early after we arrived on an early flight from Kauai, which was not expected but appreciated. The room was small but nice, white, spotlessly clean and comfortable. It had a large flat screen TV, not a tiny little one. The bathroom was large, white, modern and also spotless. The bed was super comfy. The hotel has a rooftop pool which was bigger than I expected and also spotlessly clean. Someone else mentioned it could be updated but I liked it as is. I don't think it needs to be any fancier. In the lobby there is complimentary tea, coffee and water, along with an ice machine. There was also a couple of computers with free internet but the wifi in the rooms was super quick so we didn't use them. There was also complimentary newspapers available. This was our third visit to Waikiki and other hotels we have stayed at in the past have been noisy with both street noise and noise from other guests doors . We didn't hear much noise at all from the street, none of those pesky garbage trucks, and rarely heard other guests doors even though the hotel was full. Yes the air conditioner was a little loud at times, but we just turned it off and enjoyed the trade breezes. This hotel is in a great location close to everything. We walked everywhere including Ala Moana, Ward Centre, beaches, Diamond Head, but there is a bus stop close by to get you around if you are not a walker. In all, this place felt like a home away from home and I would definately stay here again.

So glad we ended up choosing this hotel. In Hawaii you don't spend much time in your room as you are always at the beach or doing things. Also, the resort pools, which are generally nicer than the shoreline one, are so packed you would never go in there! The beach is where you want to spend all your time anyway. And while the hotel didn't have a gym, they had a deal with a great gym down the road for $10 that overlooks waikiki beach! Much better than any resort gym! The location was very convenient in the central part of waikiki and walking distance to everything. The rooms had been recently renovated and felt very modern and clean. There is a fairly large airconditioning vent in the room which can be a little noisy, but it was actually one of the things I really liked about the room as they had decorated it with hawaiin sayings which was a nice quirk.

Location: The location was perfect for me, only a block away from Waikiki beach, a 3 to 4 minute walk to the International Market (via taking the back streets, it takes me right to the foodcourt). Most tours pick you up and drop you off across the road from the hotel. Shopping is right in your front door step (practically).. the pink trolley line only about a 2 minute walk from there. Overall, everything is within easy walking distance. Another thing is I felt safe in this hotel and also, walking around on my own at 11pm at night in this area which is important for a female solo traveller.Room: Despite the room being on the small side - the room was very clean and the same with the bathroom.. Cleanliness is important to me and Shoreline definitely delivered that. It is sooo nice to check in to a really nice clean room! The bed was comfortable and loved the ambience and overall decor of this boutique hotel. I was on the 11th floor so quite high up - for that reason - I didn't hear any street noise.. and hardly heard a peep from the other rooms. bonus! The only tiny downside is the air conditioner is right there and got quite loud.. lucky, I didn't really need it as I often had my balcony door open to let the breeze in at night.Service: Overall, I was very satisfied with the service. There was a wrong billing when I used the printer in the lobby but I was refunded promptly. Also, housekeeping at one stage kept forgetting to replace the dirty coffee cup - it sat there for a couple of days until I left a note to request for a new clean cup. Attention to detail would have been good. But overall, as mentioned this hotel is clean :-) The hotel reception, were very helpful - I enquired about public transportation (the receptionist gave me directions to where to go and also told me where the little side streets to take shortcuts to get to the International Market quicker. Another big plus is the free WIFI of up to 5 devices.. Really appreciated this as other hotels will probably charge you an arm and a leg or resort fees.

We also spent all of our time swimming in the ocean so I wasn't disappointed at all.When we arrived there was no room in the valet parking and we were told that we would have to park in the parking garage across the street, but we were also advised to call the front desk in the morning to check and see if there are any openings. It took two days, but we did get the valet parking and it was worth it. The valet staff was super friendly and fast. We were a little worried about the location of the hotel since it sat close to a few sketchy areas off Kuhio, but we were surprised at how quiet it was. It is a straight shot down the road to the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center and not too much further to the beach.

Anytime JDV puts their touch on a hotel, it's always a good thing. They did a nice job incorporating the aloha spirit with their uniquely JDV stamp. When looking to book a hotel in Waikiki, here are the best things to consider about the Shoreline:- Location: it's only one block from Kalakaua so it's quiet and not as loud and boisterous as the other hotels right on K, but it's close enough to all the action. It's centrally located and close to Royal Hawaiian Center and the Beach Walk. The International Marketplace is a quick 5 mins (or less) walk. Waikiki Beach is blocks away. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping areas all right downstairs. - Staff: Everyone here was genuinely helpful and friendly. The front desk staff were even so generous to extend our late check out to accommodate us since our flight was canceled and we needed to travel instead on a redeye. The housekeeping staff were always so pleasant when we would see them in the mornings. Sonny, Dustin, and Alex, the bell men and valet staff, were always prompt with retrieving our car for us. - Cleanliness/Style: the hotel is newly renovated and well appointed. - Rates: Moderately priced and great value for location. Additionally, there is always hot coffee, tea and water and a business center in the lobby available at all times. I would not hesitate to stay here again when in Waikiki. I love boutique hotels and there are so many great reasons to stay here.","San Francisco, California","aricafort27</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",2,5.0

It is ideally located, within walking distance to the beach and many restaurants, stores, and attractions. We did not rent a car, and except for a cab ride to and from the airport, we did not require a car to get to any of our activities. The hotel does not look like much from the outside, but inside is nicely decorated, looks a bit more upscale, and is very clean. There is a pool on the rooftop with a view of the ocean, which we visited a few times and always had to ourselves. The staff was gracious and accommodating, and the beds were comfortable. The rooms are on the small side. There is room to walk around the bed, and that's about it. There is no dresser, so you have to either keep all your clothes in the closet or live out of your suitcase. We did not spend much of our vacation in our room, so the small size was not a concern. My only complaint was that the towels were rough. I definitely felt that I got a great value for the price, and I would consider staying there again.","Alexandria, Virginia, United States","jennylott</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alexandria, Virginia, United States</strong>",2,4.0

The decor is modern, the room was very clean, it's so close to the beach, but the friendly and accommodating staff were definitely the best part.

Some pluses and minusesPlus - Location, clean, updated to modern 60's style, friendly staff, free wifi in room (this is big), comfortable bed, across from Ross store, rooftop pool but all concrete/good view of ocean.Minus - air conditioning directly on the bed/can get cold, no room service (Mexican restaurant next door that is OK), forgot to clean my room once and no towels another day, can't print docs except boarding pass - not really a business center, no green landscape around.So..overall a good stay for the price.

First off this hotel has been recently remodeled and they did a fantastic job! We knew that we were going to be spending more time outside of our hotel then in it and so we looked for one that met our needs. So our room was small, but had a refrigerator, coffee maker, safe for our items that we wanted locked up, wifi(which we needed to download our pics) and a very clean room. It also had a nice balcony as well. We loved the employees as they were extremely helpful on locations to visit, places to eat as well as making sure that we were happy and comfortable. Things to note: We rented our car and had the option of valet parking or for 2 dollars less we could pay 24 dollars a night to park our rental across the street. We picked Valet.

The location is fantastic, right down the street from the best shopping in Waikiki. The building is small and intimate- a lobby with a beautiful high ceiling adorned with bright colored comfortable orange leather sofas and warm inviting lighting in the evenings. The lighting fixtures swayed in the breeze coming through the louvered windows. Upon Arrival on my four day trip, I was given an upgraded room ( so thankful, wish I remembered the desk agents name)- imagine my surprise when I stepped onto the lanai in my room on the 12th floor and saw that I had an amazing ocean view!! There's a chalkboard across from the elevator with pertinent local info. I learned the Hawaiian word for child (Keiki) , was kept abreast of local sunrise/sunset times and was given a tip for the day, which I followed and was quite happy I did. My room was well appointed , with comfortable clean linens, a cute white desk chair, beautiful flat screened tv, an alarm clock that doubled as an iPod/iPhone speaker, and the toiletries were plentiful and nice as well. The outdoor pool is located on the 14th floor rooftop. It's small but sparkling and secluded. I enjoyed the ocean view while sun bathing and swimming in relative solitude. The adjoining restaurant Cha, Cha, Cha has delicious tacos and an impressive selection of tequila. There's a wall of fame for those that have tried every kind on the menu! Front desk agent Jun was more than happy to help me with my questions and my late checkout request and the bell desk stored my belongings after checkout so that I could enjoy my last day in Waikiki until my shuttle picked me up that evening for my red eye flight back home to LA. I didn't wanna leave the Shoreline. I'd live there if I could. Alas, that isn't possible right now, but a girl can dream, can't she? This was the fourth hotel in Waikiki that I have stayed in in the last three years and I enjoyed every moment of it. Thanks again and Mahalo Shoreline Waikiki.

She was absolutely right and our 10 days stay was a very happy and memorable one. The staffs were very knowledgable of the events around town and tremendous in offering advices and directions, and not to forget mentioning their happy SMILES. . Special commendations goes to Vikky, Alex and the filipino girl on the front desk.( Sorry forgot her name). The room service was excellent and front desk is always ready to check to see if we need anything and to send up clean towels if we need any.

I guess it's about a 5 minute walk to the beach, there are restaurants, coffee and shops all very close and it's very centrally located in Waikiki. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the decor is nice, and I liked having a mini fridge, microwave and coffee maker in the room. There's no pool or fitness center but they have $10 passes to 24 hour fitness which is about a half mile away. The staff is very friendly and welcoming but there's no concierge or bellman since it's such a small hotel. I paid extra for the partial ocean view room and as you can see from the picture, it was just ok. I almost wish I had gone with the cheaper room without a view. I usually woke up at 6:30 or 7 everyday when the sun came up, but I noticed a lot of noise in the hallway from 7 to 9 or so; doors slamming, keys jangling, walkie talkies, so if you wanted to sleep in at all, it would've been impossible. Housekeeping did an ok job, but tended to leave at least one thing unchecked each day (not a big deal, but I wasn't going to call the front desk everyday; just not much attention to detail).I would stay here again - the location is good, the staff is friendly, rooms are nice, it's just very basic.
