The location is the only thing going for this 'hotel'.The room was cold. The toilet wouldn't flush. The faucet was leaking.The strangest thing was the blood like splatters I found in the bath tub.I was on the top floor, so the blood could be coming from the roof. I couldn't find where the blood was dripping from. They were soon washed away by the leaking faucet, so I have no proof if they were indeed blood or they ever existed.This is a place I would never return.","Boston, Massachusetts","pacmom04</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",4,1.0

It started even with the first check-in. The manager Erin is very rude and not professional to treat customers. She used threatening language for a small matter of miscommunication. She behaved like this hotel is her and she can do anything she likes. Anyway I was sent to the top floor room. When I opened the door, I found the room is not made: the bed is a mess, the towels are on the floor. There is even a towel in the toilet! I called the front desk about this and ended up moving to another room on the same floor. However, the heating in the room is bad and I did not have much sleep because of the cold and noice. I had a room on the 8th street side and It kept producing noice throughout the night. Next morning when I talked with my friends, founding most of them had no heating either. They all complained about the noice. One friend said his tv is not working (I did not even bother to test mine) and another complained that there is no hot water in his room. The worst things are that when we came back the afternoon, my friend found his room door is wide open and there is nobody around! Fortunately, he did not lost anything. However my other friend is not that fortunate, he found his iphone charger and Apple watch charger are missing from his room! They both reported the incidents to the front desk immediately. My friend was asked to check if his chargers were misplaced anywhere in the room. But the room is so small that it is even difficult to misplace anything! Anyway, If you don't care about the service, the safety and noice, you can at least found the only good thing about this hotel is its location. For me, this is my worst nightmare experience and I will avoiding this kind of hotels.",,674yuanp,0,1.0

The rooms were clean albiet spartan. This is definitely for those just looking for a clean place to go to sleep after a long day. It is not a hotel filled with amenities and spaciousness in rooms. This is clean bare bones living. Downside is that it is centrally heated and my room was warm. I could of opened the window but with NYC noice it was a debate between which one would keep me up worse. Also the hot water is very very hot, so careful as easy to scald oneself if not careful. Otherwise, go in with your eyes open knowing it is bare bones living.

Next to subway about 3/4 blocks down to get to where you want to be. I would totally recommend using subway rather than taxi/Ubers they cost so much and you spend majority of the time just in traffic. Google tells you what subway to use and where to get off easy as that! It costs next to nothing as well. We used airtrain to get to this hotel so took us about 50 mins to get to the hotel from JFK.The hotel itself has everything you need, we was on 4th floor so the sound/noise wasn't as bad as if you were to be on the ground floor I imagine. You are in New York no matter where you stay within walking distance you will have noise.We had a private bathroom, bath/shower was lovely and easy to use. Bed was super comfy. Very clean. If you want maid service you have to put the sign on your door everyday which we did and came back to fresh sheets everyday! The staff are lovely and really helpful. Checking in and out was hassle free. They have breakfast which is bagel and muffins with orange juice and coffee for on the go (added bonus for us because we didn't even realise it was included). You are surrounded by lots of little corner shops, pizza shops, dunkin donuts, taco bell, some bars just literally within steps so when you get back and just want to crash, you won't have to go far for food! We went to rooftop bars one night and walked there and back so everything really is close (when used Google all the time to get from a to b).Only downside is there is no lift. They have some rooms downstairs. For us it was fine but after 4 days of being on your feet all day everyday and have a stupidly heavy suitcase from all the shopping getting down them stairs at check out was hard work lol. Staff would have probably helped if asked as they are really nice.I would definitely recommend.

Maid only made our bed once in a week - sheets were never changed and we had to call down for towels one morning because we weren’t left any. Our key cards stopped working 3 times so had to keep going back to reception. Breakfast was just a muffin or bagel - and only until 9am and not 11am as it was stated in our room. Rooms weren’t really clean and really dated considering the hotel is quite new. The bathroom layout was just odd -toilet right next to the sink and mirror so you couldn’t really get to the mirror at all, towel rail was broke and kept falling out and the light is the bathroom didn’t work properly.

Also there was a sink with a mirror in the room,and a small bathroom. As we had just a 1-night stay,that was a perfect place to have a sleep.

The pictures lie because they didn't show the crap room that we had received like 2 feet of free space, mattress felt like just a boxspring. The sink was outside the bathroom with no room for anything you bring with you. Channels had no local networks. I'm average build and I could barely fit on the toilet there because they crammed it 1 inch from the wall with the toilet paperholder jutting into you. Me and my girlfriend left in 15 minutes of arriving. We set a nonrefundable deposit and we were so upset with the room we didn't even stay the night. Oh and with the door closed I could hear someone at normal volume all the way at the end of the hall as if they were right next to us. The best part was the employee at the front had nothing to say when we talked about the room he just was quiet like he gets this same complaint over and over again. Wouldn't be surprised if he does I'm sorry that he has to deal with so many dissatisfied customers.

In a way it's more like a hostel than a 'hotel'. But personally , I really enjoyed my one night stay here. I was on the first floor, and of course could hear the traffic, but it didn't bother me. The room was tiny, but I like smaller spaces and again, for one night it was perfect. Tiny bathroom sink was kind of adorable. Great water pressure in the shower (I have thick hair so that was a treat). The bed was incredibly comfortable and I got a great sleep that night. I would have definitely stayed longer had circumstances allowed. The staff was incredibly helpful - I have medication that needs to be refrigerated and they stored it in their staff room, and very nice when I had to bug them at midnight for my evening dose. The location is amazing. 100 feet from the best slice of pizza in New York. And close to Penn Station.Had I been staying longer, this would have been a perfect place to stash my bag (I was traveling with only one backpack) and explore the city.So I think it depends on what you're looking for, and who you are.

We made the booking around 11pm, and I understand the dicey nature of things when booking a hotel room later in the night on the day of; however, when I arrived at the hotel they didn't have any rooms available when I had already paid for and booked the room online. It was incredibly disappointing that we not only booked the room online, but also paid at the time of booking as there are discounts offered for doing so. I understand how there can be complications with what third party sites show versus what is actually available at the hotel, but the front desk agent did not attempt to remedy the situation at all. To me, it seems like it would make sense in this type of scenario to express a bit more compassion for a disappointed guest; moreover, I was working and decided at the last minute I needed a room really just needing a place to crash for the night. When a hospitality company makes an error you would think they would go above and beyond to fix their blunder; here, the front desk agent simply ignored me and was completely rude. He displayed an angry temperament as if I was at fault: stating he did not see my reservation, and then simply just pawned the problem off to it being an issue that the booking website needed to be contacted about without any accountability. The fact of the matter was that I chose this place due to there not being much availability on this particular night at my usual hotels in this part of town. Furthermore, this particular place was oversold, and I understand the nature of the problem and their inability to provide me the room as hotels and airlines overbook for no shows. That being said, my interaction with the front desk agent when I got there was incredibly off-putting, and the fact was I had already paid and he never gave me a refund: making it seem as if I didn't even have a reservation when I displayed proof that I did. I personally am knowledgable of how hotels operate, and standard operating procedure when overbooking, as hotels want to provide a premium level of service, is that they 'walk' you to another hotel nearby: they are to provide transportation and pay for a night as well. I had to go into my pockets further to pay for a room elsewhere as it is understandable that there is a processing time on refunding money, but this is the exact reason the concept of 'walking' exists since it is the hotel's fault and not the guest. After showing the agent that I did in fact pay ahead of time on booking.com and had a reservation as well, of which was an error to begin with, he still did not provide a refund and was of no help. I had to work with booking.com to fix the problem thereafter, and still had issues as the hotel itself was antagonistic. I cannot speak to the hotel itself and being a guest here overnight, but I do feel that after my interaction with the staff and with what transpired that I would decide to stay at other hotels that I have had more pleasant experiences with.","New York City, New York","clrinaldi43</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",7,1.0

When I went downstairs to ask about this, the staff went to look for it. They didn't find it and I was told that it had ""probably been thrown in the garbage"". I waited around, spoke to a few different people. The manager came and basically accused me of lying. He said it was ""impossible"" that my laundry could have been lost.

My room was clean, warm, and in satisfactory condition. The shower was hot with thick quality towels. The TV had plenty of channels and there was an ipod speaker, nice. Only thing I could have used was a full body mirror but the room was small and cozy enough for me to get some shut eye. ***A fair warning. This is right by Penn Station, and this room is not sound proof...SUPER busy, so you will hear taxis/angry drivers outside, but after while I acclimated to the sounds. Hey, it's New York!

I work in customer service for a well known airline, and if I treated my customers like that, there would be a lot of complaints coming forward. The hotel has no lift, so 4 flights with cases, but in a small hotel I expected this. The room itself was no larger than a storage cupboard.

They are VERY good about taking your stuff up, so no worries about that. In some ways, it's giving you a real NYC experience - the first apartment I had in NYC was a 4th floor walk up, and this felt VERY similar. The rooms are TINY - mine was barely big enough to fit a twin bed - but again, this is NYC - what did you expect? That said, the rest of the experience is fine. The rooms are clean, the lobby is nice, the location is actually very central - you'll have to walk a few blocks to find good food, but it's right behind Madison Square Garden, and easy walking distance to midtown, the empire state building, etc, etc. If you have the time, walk over the West Side Highway, walk down the river, and then cross back over to the High Line, and walk back to the end.

I would not likely stay at this hotel again.The hotel is is very well-located if you want to spend most of your time in Midtown (at Macy's, Times Square, going to Broadway shows, etc). And it's also close to Penn Station - Since we arrived early on a Friday and left late on a Sunday, we wanted to drop off luggage on both ends of our trip - It was easy to do since the hotel was only a block and a half from Penn Station (we arrived by train).We found the hotel to be clean - the rooms, the hallway, the lobby. Consistently clean. We also found the rates to be very reasonable. Very competitive in the otherwise expensive NYC hotel market. The staff at reception was friendly and pleasant. The rooms were small, and the bathrooms were tinier. The lobby was also tiny (Only had sitting for 2 people.) And we expected that.... What we didn't expect was that the hotel had NO amenities. It didn't have amenities like a gym, room service, or an elevator. And, moreover, everything about the hotel lacked basic convenience and function. For example ....--Our bathroom did not have an electrical outlet (couldn't blow dry hair or shave in the bathroom and thus had to do those things without a mirror).--Our room had a TV but it was fixed on a wall perpendicular to the bed. Bottom line - you could not watch TV from the bed.--There was no bed stand next to the bed, so there was nowhere to put glasses or a book. --One side of the double bed was flush against the wall, so it was difficult to get in and out out of the bed without waking up the other person in the bed.--The walls are thin, and you can hear everything. We could hear our neighbor watching Family Guy one night - we could even hear exactly what Stewie and Brian were saying. And we heard our neighbor's iPhone alarm loud and clear at 6 am one morning.--Our friend (in an adjoining room) said the street noise was very loud and disruptive in her room. In addition, the bathroom was very poorly designed:--You can't stand in front of the sink because the toilet is there (instead, you have to stand to the side of the sink.). --The toilet has no cover, and there is limited space to put toiletries, so you live in constant fear of dropping something in the toilet. --The water from the sink was either scalding or freezing.--You have to stand in the shower to turn it on (b/c of the fixed glass door) so you alternate between being freezing cold and being scalding hot while you work to adjust the fickle and delayed temperature controls. --Our shower had a serious leak - no, a stream of water that ran for days. In fact, so much water was pouring out that it sounded like someone was in the shower. At night, we had to keep the bathroom door closed because it was so loud. Also, there was so much water, it was splashing and ending up on the bathroom floor (slip hazard). We told management several times, but they didn't successfully fix it. At one point, they put a washcloth to try and stop the splattering. But the constant stream of water running continued throughout our entire stay.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","VanNessVoyager</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",92,2.0

Recenthly renovated, nice bed and towels, clean, but in most rooms there are not even closets to put your clothes that makes it impossible to stay for longer than a weekend. The staff is very friendly and helped us with suitcases but didn't seem to know much about the area and ways to move around. However, they were willing to print out quides for the MET and MOMA when asked.","Athens, Greece","Vasilis_Pyr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Athens, Greece</strong>",0,3.0

It is noisy during the night and from dawn onwards but this is NY.First of all, if you are unlucky enough to travel on your own, you will be checked in in a single room which is less than 4sq.m. There is no wardrobe, so unless if you are a guy travelling in your jeans and T, you have a serious problem. There is nowhere to put your suitcase so you have to open it on your bed, get your stuff out and then close it everynight so that it can fit in the room (unless you wanna block the back of your door which I do not recommend in case of an emergency).The bathroom is so small and hot that you do not want to spent one minute there. In addition, its airventilator is so noisy you cant stand it. The sink is so small there is no where to put your toiletries and the same goes for the shower. Even after continuous complaining that I was moved to a bigger room the bathroom was still the same with a mirror that you cannot see yourself because of his strange position. The bed was very nice in this bigger bedroom.Staff of the hotel are ok. Men better that women based on their knowledge, effort and also efficiency. Did I mention that the ""hotel"" has no elevator? Staff will take your luggage upstairs but in case you went downstairs and you have forgotten your phone charger, dont even think of going up those steep steps again! You will start your day tired.The entrance of the hotel is just a small ramp and the reception area has only two chairs available to the public, so if one couple is checking out and you are checking in and you have to queue there is no place for you to sit.",Greece,"myrtia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greece</strong>",11,2.0

We booked the trip very last minute and this was the hotel we found after reading terrible reviews from other hostels and hotels close by. We wanted to stay on Manhattan because it would be closer to everything. The location of this hotel is the perfect place to stay considering that we were going out to party every night. The 24 hour front desk was great. The night shift guy, Yung, was one of the nicest people I have ever met. He lent us a bottle opener, gave us a few maps to some good local nightclubs, and made sure to welcome us back every time with a huge smile. Everyone on staff at the hotel was very kind and friendly. We checked out late due to a minor complication on our parts, and the hotel staff was understanding and did not charge us for any extra fees. There is also a roof that is accessible, which was good for us to hang out before a night on the town.The rooms are small, but modern, and very clean. Of the two beds in our room, one was a single and one was a double - perfect for three people. The double bed's mattress was a bit stiff but my single bed was very comfortable. There was also a flat screen TV in the room with a lot of channels, and wifi (but sometimes the wifi is a bit spotty). There is no fridge in the room though. The room in general is a bit small but we were three people and it was comfortable. Another downside is that there is no hotel parking, and the parking closeby is very expensive (33-39$ a day) with little street parking.We had no issues at all. Our passports, laptops and phones were left in the rooms and nothing went missing. The cleaning staff did an impeccable job without making me feel like they'd gone through out things. There wasn't a safe in the room but I didn't feel that it was necessary. All in all, considering that you go to New York City to be outside and enjoy the sites, food, and nightlife/attractions, I think this is a good place to stay at a decent price. I would recommend this place more for someone on a budget who wants a private room rather than staying in a hostel which can be less safe and less private for your group/couple. I don't think that this would be an ideal place for an older couple or a family because it might be a bit claustrophobic (especially with kids), and there is no elevator in the building (but only 4 floors plus the roof), but for younger travellers, it was perfect.My friends and I had a very good experience here. I would recommend the hotel to my friends, as we were pleasantly surprised with the place and had a great stay. Thank you, Manhattan West Hotel!","Montreal, Canada","Katrina C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",4,4.0

The staff at the front desk are very nice. The only problem is, they did not seem to know a lot about the area. We asked for breakfast recommendations twice, and it was always disapointing, knowing NYC has so many restaurants and things to offer. Whenever we asked any questions, we never felt their answer was helping us. Management should maybe train their staff a little more about attractions and restaurants.The bed is VERY hard, and from our room we could hear everything in the street and the hallway.Again, staff was always smilling and very nice, did their best to help.","Montreal, Canada","Watermelon A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",2,2.0

Our first room was tiny. Then we got an upgrade to a spacious (i.e. normal) room, with a queen and a twin bed. So, check the size of the room first.The staff is very helpful and willing to do things right. The hotel opened in May 2014 so everything is new and clean. The location is great -- close to Penn Station Metro, Madison Square Garden, Macy's and shops in 34th, The High line, etc. If you want to stay out a lot, this is great. If you plan to spend time in your room, this is not for you!","Santiago, Chile","LuchoAbdon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santiago, Chile</strong>",15,3.0
