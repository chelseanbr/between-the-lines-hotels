The lobby area is nice along with nice views from the upper floors. There is also a good number of shopping and eating options in the area, and even within a very easy walk to McD's and Walmart. Parking is available but is a bit of a pain to access as you have to change elevators to access floors 3-9 which is the parking areas. It is also can get quite costly at about $20 a day.Now the bad, the Apt we stayed in was decently clean, had a decent bed, but the rest of the furniture and accommodations were cheap. Even the kitchen utensils, silverware, and cookware were pathetic. Since I have now found out these are condo units and owned by individuals, I guess it makes sense that some are better than others. This room wasn't terrible but it could definitely use some upgrades.This is downtown, so after about 6 pm all the business people are gone and all that is left is the homeless and they are EVERYWHERE. Not the fault of the hotel but Oahu has a serious homeless problem and it shows, in this area, at night.","Huntsville, Alabama","Speedracer61</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Huntsville, Alabama</strong>",120,3.0

My room wasn't ready but front desk found 3608 available so I assigned this one. When I walked in it smelled like cigarettes had been smoked in it but more importantly, I was amazed at the size of this room. I was greeted with a fully kitted out kitchen (except an oven) that could fit three people easily. After this was a huge lounge, great carpet, leather lounge suite, decent size HD 40"" or more TV with cable, and seating for at least five people. Probably more given the space it commanded. A slide door separates it from the master bedroom (that's how I would describe it), including another TV screen, office desk and this room was also huge. It also has a washer and dryer and ample wardrobe space. I think the ensuite needs an upgrade especially the bathtub, the tv in the master room doesn't work, and the internet too. I called front desk and spoke with Niz. We both tried trouble shooting looking at the equipment but that wasn't the problem. Niz called the internet provider and they couldn't find what the problem was. I couldn't log in to internet and I had two university guest lectures to give in: 12-3pm and 6-8pm. It wasn't until 1am in the morning when Niz rescued me and put me in 3805 so I can get an internet connection. Wow! This room was awesome. It was certainly an upgrade. It was immaculate and a step up from 3608. Niz has been at the Aston for a decade or more and an able supervisor. She went all out to make sure my stay was comfortable so I would like to commend Niz.",,mosesf2015,5,4.0

This was a very good option as it was centrally located and the price was right and we knew people who had stayed here and the reviews were pretty good. Edit appears to be a bunch of condos or such that are rented out nightly as hotel rooms. So I think that the furnishings might be a little different. The rooms are outside and in some respects but our room on the 31st floor facing east toward the mountains was very very spacious with a mini kitchen dining table and chairs and a desk and a large fridge The bathroom was adequate and the bedroom side was quite large. My only complaint about the bedroom side was no chair or sofa or any place to sit.

Separate bedroom with TV had glass walls and sliding glass door to living room (possible safety hazard). Living room had no couch or TV. But did have dining table and full kitchen. The parking garage was tight, with 10 levels. We were charged $25.00 for the night - reasonable compared to Waikiki hotels. The ambiance around the pool (open air on 11th floor of connecting building) was excellent with 3 palm trees and other plantings, and rock mini-wall as outside shower.

It is an urban hotel that is really a set of condos. Arriving at 9 pm there were already numerous homeless people on the street in close proximity to front entrance, which is an escalator. Our Uber driver told us not to walk around after dark. The woman at the front desk told us, yes, there were numerous homeless out there, but “if you leave them alone, they won’t bother you.” Not the Aloha welcome we were expecting. So the location, other than being close to pier, is really bad and should be avoided. To make bad matters even worse, the hotel is just a set of condos managed by a management company and is not managed well. I agree with other reviews that their employees don’t care because it’s not their property, a common issue with like properties. They know nothing of the rooms. We upgraded to a water view and I posted a photo of the view. Hardly any water and lots of industrial equipment. The rooms are suites, but there is no curtain on the French doors dividing the bedroom from the living space. So it cannot be used as a suite, as someone cannot sleep while your partner is watching TV or even reading in the living area. The room was sparse with nothing to sit on except a low quality pull out couch that slid when you sat on it. No rugs or carpet, our room looked more like a dressing room in Macy’s than a hotel room. The air travel above hotel is very loud and disturbing, and our room had a steady set of loud thumps that came on a regular basis, also very disturbing. As a added bonus, if you stay on the weekend, the restaurant is closed. Not even a coffee bar in the lobby with muffins. Nothing! Instead they give you a map to venture among the homeless outside to find a nearby Seven Eleven or Starbucks. The TV operation is also incomprehensible to operate with a explanatory card providing numerous sets of codes to just turn it on. It didn’t work the first five times we tried to turn it on. The simple on/off switch on the remote does not work normally. In short, I would avoid this “hotel” as it is not a hotel at all and is not safe at night. Need to take Uber to dock anyway do I would recommend staying at a real hotel in a safe area that has basic amenities that this place lacks.

The staff will greet you each morning if you are engaging with them. They will go out of their way to address any questions or concerns you have about your room, your stay, local destinations and directions to anywhere you want to go. They will even make arrangements for a cab which will pick you up right out front but understand if you want to take Uber or Lyft instead. Now for those who have made comments about the neighborhood...lets say that the neighborhood at night is no different then any large city you have visited and yes there are homeless but they have never approached me during any of my stays like in some big cities (SF, CHI, ATL, NY) I have been to and I feel totally safe. Now for the rooms, yes they may not meet some peoples expectation and the hotel is working on improvements and upgrades. The rooms are clean, large with Flat screen TV in bedroom and sitting room not to mention having all of the amenities a person needs who wants to cook for themselves during their stay. And if you are missing anything the staff will promptly make sure you have what you need or replace what is missing. If your room does not come with a washer dryer the hotel has a laundry room onsite with plenty of washer dryers. Not all rooms look out to the water so make sure when you book mention the type of view you would like and how high up you want. The staff will make every effort to accommodate your requests. For those who are noise sensitive, yes you might hear an occasional siren but where can you go in a downtown setting that you cant. Even in Waikiki you have lots of noise. All I can say is don't be discouraged by the reviews, check it out for yourself. Google Earth the area and see for yourself. I often walk late at night and see many local runners taking advantage of the less congested nights to get in a run. Did I mention there is a 24 hour Fitness just down the block. Did I mention there are three Starbucks within walking distance. And for those with a fast food on your mind a McDonalds and 7-Eleven plus many local eateries like L&L Hawaiian Barbecue for a taste of the island.Oh and don't get me started on the fresh doughnuts just across the street. They open early and the selections is fantastic. No one thought to mentioned that there is a Walmart, Walgreens and Longs drugs within the block radius for those items you left behind.

It wasn’t exactly a “hotel” as we expected, but rather an apartment/condo situation shared with more permanent residents.

We stayed on 14th and 30th floors.Good Stuff: Staff and security are awesome. Very friendly. Housekeeping was consistently great. Views of Honolulu are also fun from the tower. Both rooms clean and comfortable.Not as good: The location is over a bus line resulting in lots of transient traffic just outside. 4 out of 7 nights had long bouts of screaming easily heard 30 stories up. Not the hotels fault, just is-what-it-is in a city.Parking: You will want a car because walking vacation locations are limited. It will cost $25 each night to park it, we were given a spot 7 levels up and against a wall.

My previous stay at this property was decent as the room was nice (beautiful view and nice room) with amenities to match. This particular visit, however, was not up to standards. I'll start with the positives first: customer service was very good; the room was large w/ a kitchenette, dining area, couch and breath-taking views. Negatives: the front escalator is out so I had to wait for a very small elevator which only comes after pressing the button for the front desk (minor complaint). The room was not near as nice as the previous smaller room I had. First off the door to the room was beat to heck. The carpet was stained in numerous areas (picture attached of one area). I turned on the TV and could not get it to work so I called the front desk and they stated I needed to follow the directions that are posted on the night stand. Wow, I've not seen something so complicated, but maybe it was because I had traveled for almost 24 hours to get to Honolulu. Anyway I tried to figure this out for 20 minutes before I gave up and called the front desk again. Maintenance came promptly and after some tinkering around determined that the cable box was unplugged. He plugged it in and turned on the TV. He left and after unpacking I tried to change the channel--no go. I repeated the direction on the nightstand. Nope. I called back and maintenance was sent promptly to my room. He came in and it worked. He left and I worked with the remote and found out that it only worked if I pointed it within 1 foot of the cable box aimed right at it. At least it worked, that day. On day 2, I turned on the tv and after pointing at the cable box and pressing the remote buttons for almost 30 minutes, and moving only 5 stations I left it where it was (on the news). Day 3, I tried over and over to change the channel but it would not work. The tv would come on but was stuck on the Hawaii Info channel. Two last comments about the room: the AC control is as old as I've seen anywhere (see photo). That may explain why I had it on 70 and it was hot as Hades all the time, especially in the middle of the night. Bathroom needs a make-over.The Pool: I didn't bring a towel as I expected for them to have them by the pool as most hotels, but I couldn't find any. The décor of the pool is so drab, it was depressing. I only stayed out for an hour. I think that is enough for now.

We could not get 2 rooms we had to get 2 suites for three of us. The rooms were not next to each other but they were on the same floor. The rooms were good and we were happy with the cleaning. Being downtown we had to catch buses to Waikiki every day. You cannot walk to the beach from this hotel. For a holiday it is much better to be in Waikiki. There are also a lot of homeless people living next to Walgreens across the road which is also the bus stop. The air was stale on our floor but good in the room. The internet speed was fast and we were very happy with this. We were close to all the bus routes so were able to get to most places for a minimal cost. That is $5 US for unlimited bus trips each day. We got good value out of this using Google to suggest bus routes and times. The pool is really good, you can do laps and there are plently of lounge chairs, tables etc. For people who are not familiar with Honolulu, this hotel is in the business district and does not have a resort atmosphere.

Instead of staying in Waikiki, we opted to stay in a mountain-view condo at this modern, full-service hotel. It is in the middle of downtown at the corner of Bishop (aka Pali Highway) and South Hotel. It is easy to get to places by car/foot. The Iolani Palace, King statue and other attractions are just minutes away by foot. No resort fees, and TheBus (Oahu’s public bus) goes to/from Waikiki stops nearby (if you’re 65+, bring your Medicare card for reduced fares). For food and supplies, there’s a Walmart the next block over and two pharmacies, a UPS Store and 7-Eleven are at street level. We cook most of our meals, so it was great being able to walk to the grocery store. We had a full kitchen, nice bathroom, spacious living room, a lovely bedroom with a wonderfully-comfortable bed and views in two directions, very good washer/dryer, and daily maid service. The outside walls of these units are floor-to-ceiling windows! The condos are individually owned, so each is different in furnishings. Our unit came with two rickety barstools (for “dining” at the counter), minimal kitchenware (no cutting board, wine glasses, peeler, measuring cups/spoons, colander, or decent chopping knife!), no dining room furniture or coffee table, and the bedroom smelled like “dog”. Here’s where the exceptional service comes in: the housekeeping staff went “way beyond the call of duty” to make sure we would be comfortable for our 2-week stay: they got rid of the dog smell, lined up requested kitchenware, and convinced the owner that it was about time to get new barstools. Not possible to get a coffee table (because the couch is a pullout bed??), but the ironing board worked well as a coffee/dinner table. The housekeeping manager stayed in touch with us throughout our stay. All staff we met were friendly, very helpful and efficient. Email them to get boarding passes, etc. printed. The hotel is in the midst of upgrading elevators which are a bit slow. They have a lovely pool/spa area. Parking is $20 extra per day.

The staff (especially the lady forgot her name) at the front were very helpful by providing directions, laundry detergent (paid item), colander, can opener, batteries for remote control, lodging and parking statements, responding to complaints which showed relatively quick results. First few week, I had problem with elevators, which had mind of their own. However, that problem had been mitigated after I complained about. They were in the process of updating the system any way. Parking is in a way inconvenient due to it has a separate ten story parking garage building next to it and I paid 20 some dollars for each night. Don't expect drivers stopping at the stop sign while driving up and down the building. Nice thing about this parking garage is there are two ways out. First time I stayed I smelled some awful funky odor in the lobby area and even in the hallway of the floor I stayed but not this time. Thank you. The hotel provides room service once a week. I had a double door refrigerator which I had no problem storing all the food. Enough ice cubes are always in the freezer. I was able to cook some simple dish without any problem. One big TV is in the living room and small one in the bedroom. Enough desk space for doing some study or business. Wi-Fi and wired internet available. Decent bathroom has a bathtub with jet, which I never used. In this room, I still had a nice view of the town but the privacy was an issue. I could see the people working in the offices in the same level across the street. Air conditioning kept me cool during the day and night. Sometime I doubt the air quality in the room looking at the vents. I also heard fan noise or something all the time but I became ignoring it.

Getting from the main street (ground level) to the lobby (floor -1) with 3 suitcases and all other luggage you would expect with a baby took about 15 minutes. First to actually find the elevator, which was hidden quite well in a corner. Secondly, the elevator did not had a button, but only an intercom system through which you must ring the reception to send the elevator to you. Not knowing this, we managed to squeek into the elevator when someone got out, went to the penthouse and back. Luckely the standard stop is -1, so we could get out. A bit nerve wrecking that the elevator is not very patient: its alarm (for wanting to close it doors) already sounds after what only feels like a few seconds (and 1.5 suitcases removed from the elevator). We finally get to our room, a suit. Extraordinary lay out, with a little fairly good equiped kitchen (incl. a bench facing the microwave). The sleeping area is also quite large, which is very nice if you have a lot of suitcases to open and pack.When arriving back from a few hours strolling around staff provided us with a baby bed (without even having requested that). This was very friendly, and I did not expect this in a business hotel. On departure (with the 100+ luggage items we had), the reception gave us a big cart (the ones bell boys normally use) to store our luggage on, which we could hold on for a bit. They really made an effort to make our departure smooth and kept a track of time, which was much appreciated.Very conveniently located: walking distance to major sites, some nice restaurants etc. Not much to do around there at night though.Although not cheap (but nothing touristy is cheap in Hawaii), I was quite happy with this hotel.",EU,"Anmabech</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>EU</strong>",79,4.0

As a result, took advantage of the convenient location near Walgreens, Longs, etc.,etc, to buy several air fresheners. The TV has ""special"" instructions and one has to try (and re-try) a combination of buttons before it works. At least two of the elevators were in disrepair, and ran slow and made strange, loud noises.

I had an entire suite all to myself for what it would cost me to stay in Waikiki (anywhere in Waikiki, whether you're on the beach or not), and I did not miss having to drive in that traffic or be around wall-to-wall tourists AT ALL. I've been going to Hawaii for years for work, and in my opinion, the food is much better near the Aston as well. The Wi-Fi is free, parking is only $20/night (it can run an average of $25-30 and higher in Waikiki), and again, you have an entire SUITE to yourself with fantastic views of the mountains and ocean wharf. Many great restaurants that locals favor are within walking distance, or they're only a short Uber ride away. You have easy access to Nimitz Highway and subsequently H1, and the hotel staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. There is even a drug store, Starbucks, and Aloha salads (if you haven't tried it yet, DO IT) right outside the hotel, so you can easily get necessities, coffee, and a quick fresh meal when you want it.

The hotel said there was no way to ensure the size bed I requested, but they would mark it in their system that I requested anything bigger than a double.

Kitchen was adequate-- lacking on some niceties like a toaster or a cookie sheet (to make toast in the oven), but it's a block to Walmart, so if there's anything you really want, you can pick it up easily and cheaply. One day of a stay had serious issues with the elevator-- one was down for scheduled maintenance and one was ""reserved"" for a resident moving out...it took over 1/2 hour to finally get an elevator. But that was one day and we never had more than 4 minute wait any other day (which I cannot say for the Hilton). Staff was so friendly and eager to be helpful. Nice to be able to easily walk to Iolani and the Capitol (and Honolulu Hale if you're around for City Lights), Chinatown, and the Aloha Tower. No beach to walk to, but can be a nice trade to make if you're not eager to stay in the crush of Waikiki. Wi-fi and wired internet worked great the whole stay and I never taxed the bandwidth even streaming (again, definitely not something I can say for the Hilton even with ""premium"" service I was having trouble accessing even text only mail). There was a slightly musty aroma in the room, but again, it was very obviously cleaned well, so I think that's just a relic of humid environment and windows that don't open. We saw no bugs at all (again, not something I can say about the Hilton). Reserved parking is both nice and a problem-- you just have to call the desk to get a spot in order to even check in (no loading zone in front).

There was a beer bar around the corner and hooters which were both great but the location is questionable unless you have to work there but even then I would personally rather commute from Waikiki which is paradise.

I had asked the front desk for laundry change of $1.50 in quarters earlier in the morning with no problem. When I was putting in my quarters for the dryer, it turned out one of the quarters was a canadian coin, so it wouldn't take the quarter. I was short a quarter, but had 2 dimes and nickel. With my clothes still in the dryer, waiting for the last quarter, I went downstairs to see the front desk person (different person from the one who had given me change before), for change for ONE quarter. First, he was on the phone...he indicated that it may be a few minutes before he can help me. I indicated to him, that all I needed was change for a quarter. He still had me wait...I waited patiently for the few minutes. When I went up again, and told him I was just one quarter short of the laundry machine, and just needed one quarter, he asks me what room # I was in. I told him, for I was staying in the condo section this time. He then proceeded to say that he is not able to give change to non-hotel guests. I told him, all I needed was change for 2 dimes and nickel, for one quarter. He tells me, he is short on quarters, and wouldn't do it. So I went on the other side to the security person, and asked her if she had a quarter. She went into her personal purse to check, but didn't have any, and yet at least checked. I then asked a maintenance person who was vacuuming, and he happened to have one in his pocket, so I could put that last quarter in to dry my clothes. The complaint here is, I was only asking for change for a quarter. The refusal of customer service for a little thing as that, does the opposite of making someone's day. There would have been no skin off his back to show a little aloha. People in the service field, need training in little gestures going a long way. In this case, the lack of it, had an opposite affect.","Island of Hawaii, Hawaii","KuJo924</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Island of Hawaii, Hawaii</strong>",2,3.0

It is a business center / office suite building. If you're looking to do business downtown, this is it. Just a short walk to most places. If you're looking for the nightlife at Waikiki, grab a taxi. Area: the area is in the Hawaii Pacific University. Most maps would show this hotel smack inside the university property. There are a few homeless down the street but they keep to themselves. There are plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, and shops in the immediate area. No need to go elsewhere for food. Within 2-3 blocks is a wealth of dive bars, nice bars, eateries, and fantastic restaurants. Ask the hotel for their long list of restaurants in the area. 5 star food in 2 star space. Use Yelp too.Rooms: ours was huge with a large separate living area with couches and TV, full kitchen, separate large bedroom with TV, bathroom was ok size with tub/shower. The room was a bit dated but the room size and location made up for it. The room was at least 500 sq ft. It even had a separate room and desk at the entry for your secretary. Hotel: Service was quiet and efficient. Very nice employees. The one bad thing is you will never know it was the Aston. There are no signs. Look for ""Executive Center"". Wish I knew that as I drove by 5 times before figuring it out. Hukilau restaurant is on the lobby level. Nice local fare place. Tip: If you are driving, you will need to drive into the Exec Center parking and get a parking pass from the front desk. Just park anywhere for 15 minutes and move your car once you're assigned to a space. There is no front entrance porte cochere. Tip2: Get a room with a new bed. The old ones are small, uneven, and bounce. So, a good place to be for business. Don't come here looking for pool action, sunsets, or the drink on the beach. This is your downtown hotel that caters to the business folks. Having said that, it is a great location for business, great proximity to foodie restaurants, and has large efficient rooms.","San Jose, CA","headkona</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, CA</strong>",17,3.0

What is somewhat unusual is that each room is individually owned by a private owner, and the Aston is the property manager and hotel service. Each owner has the ability to offer their unit to a rental pool (which becomes an available hotel room) when the owner is not personally using the room.This setup, while ideal for an investor, creates a wide range of mixed reviews because each room may have different levels of fit an finish. Some rooms are a little rough around the edges, which is something you would not expect from a higher end chain hotel. Some rooms are nicely appointed. All rooms must meet a minimum standard to qualify for rental through the Aston hotel management. Also a little different is that some owners may bypass the Aston management altogether and rent their rooms through places like VRBO. Those rentals are not part of the service (cleaning, linen and towels, soap, front desk etc.) and control of Aston hotel. My experience was through the Aston hotel management and not with an individual owner. A little background: The Aston company operates a number of hotels in the area, and different hotels can be literally on the next block from each other. In our case, we mistakenly pre-booked a room at one of the less desirable locations. When we found our hotel and got to the room, there was a feeling of ""wow, did me make a mistake or what?"" because we were in Waikiki, in a fairly beat up building loaded with school groups on tour. Cramped parking garage etc. We were in Honolulu on business, not vacation, so the aura of the area reeking of cheesy touristy places was unwanted. The decision was quickly decided to relocate ASAP The Aston staff at both hotels was very helpful and accommodating. I cannot give the staff enough kudos for their customer service, especially the staff at the Executive center. They were so helpful in getting us relocated, we bought them Starbucks cards as a token of our appreciation. The Executive center really is a great location. Yes, some people commented about street people, but if anyone has been in any city environment, there will be strange street people. The level of undesirables was way below places like San Francisco, or even San Diego. What makes it appear worse than it really is, is that a number of city buses stop right outside the building, so there are a lot of people milling around. There are college campus classrooms scattered throughout the area too. There is even a farmers market on some days so, it can get busy looking. For anyone setting up a stay of a week or so, all stores are within a few blocks walking distance. Walmart with full groceries, drug stores, clothing stores, donut shops, the obligatory starbucks and even a 24 hour fitness (can get a day pass at the front desk) on the same block. Literally, there is no store that is not within walking distance for daily/weekly supplies. A nice thing about some of the rooms in the Executive center is a full kitchen. Full size refrigerator to stock up, full size range and oven (think pizza), even in room washer and dryers. If you are on a working trip, going out every meal eats up a lot of time.China town is right down the street, and is the up and coming hip/trendy new restaurant location. Within easy walking distance. Any room over the 15th floor with give you a harbor view, or a mountain view. Lower levels give you a view of another building. That is just a fact of life for high rise living. Parking is included. We had a reserved space with a 24 hour access card. Most hotels in the tourist zone will charge more for parking. I do not believe there was the resort fee, or whatever the disguised term is to add more to the bill. Some complained that they had to take different elevators to get from the car to the room. This is typical for most high rise buildings, so those complaints are those who have never seen a high rise. Nothing strange or even inconvenient here. The Lobby, clad in granite and still attractive, although not cutting edge in style is where you find the front desk for the hotel, elevators and a large restaurant sports bar. There are escalators to take you to and from street level. All in all, a good feeling.","Ramona, California","bryanweaver</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ramona, California</strong>",35,4.0

Much bigger than what you'll get at any hotel in Waikiki. The interior is a bit like a small apartment. My room had a large fridge, stove and oven. The bed was comfortable. Clean and modern decor. The cleaning ladies did a fantastic job every day. Things I found strange were that they only put three pillows on the bed (most hotels have four), and despite having a great kitchen area were not well stocked with pots/pans. No toaster, blender or small pan to cook things such as eggs. Additionally, I didn't use the oven, because there weren't any pans to use in the oven. There is no balcony in these rooms, and it does get a bit stale. As for reviewers who have seen roaches, I did too. During my time here I saw three of them. As someone who has lived in Hawaii, I know it is difficult to control them in high rises. You are at the mercy of your neighbors, and most of the time they have just made their home in the walls/infrastructure. Don't leave dishes in the sink, don't leave food out and you'll reduce your chances of seeing one.AMENITIESUnimpressive. There is a small pool and jacuzzi on the 11th floor, but it is nothing to write home about. Small but adequate laundry room. You are essentially staying in a high rise where others live, so it isn't tailored to someone wanting to vacation. You will not have the full Aloha experience. (Lol). You must self park, and the parking structure is a mess. Someone ran into my rental vehicle (a headache), and people in general just drive way too fast through it. Additionally, there are a lot of blind spots in the structure that they try to fix with the use of mirrors. My biggest complaint was that there was no real lobby/loading area, so when I checked in I had to lug 3 suitcases through the parking structure, down an elevator to the basement level, then up to the 21st floor myself. This was especially frustrating when grocery shopping, and trying to carry cases of water up. LOCATIONBe prepared to see a lot of homeless people, some who keep to themselves and others that are on drugs or suffering from mental problems. Homelessness is a growing problem in Hawaii, and this area is one of the worst. During the day it isn't bad, but I don't recommend venturing out after dark. Some are screaming in the streets, and others are clearly using meth. The area is pleasant during the day with a lot of great lunch options, and a Starbucks right downstairs. This building is located in the mix of a bunch of one way streets that get backed up. I'm not sure it was any faster than driving into Waikiki, but the argument could be made since its closer. SERVICEI encountered a few hospitable employees (mostly cleaning ladies and security guards), but in general it was less than satisfactory. Someone stole my parking card, and tried to use it to get into the structure. Before the camera footage was reviewed, they charged me $50 for a replacement card. The front desk staff made it right by refunding me after they realized it was not lost, but that someone else had taken it. I didn't hate my time at Aston at the Executive Centre Hotel, but it certainly wasn't a positive experience. I travel to Hawaii frequently, and anticipate I will stay elsewhere next trip. I have had much better, and less expensive experiences with some of the extended stay options in Waikiki. With the several problems with staying here, I can't really give it more than a rating of two. There were certainly positives, but they don't outweigh the negatives.","San Antonio, Texas","Amanda M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Antonio, Texas</strong>",43,2.0

Am I rating this against the likes of the Outrigger or Surfrider on the beach of Waikiki? If so, then 3 stars, otherwise can't complain for what it is and its purpose. This is where you want to stay when you have business downtown and want utility. For that, its great. From the outside it looks like a mirrored window office building. No valet and it doesn't standout as a hotel. No balconies. Not much view of the water unless you get something on southeast edge of building but you aren't here for vacation. Plenty of parking in 9 floor? adjoining parking structure. Part of the building is occupied condominiums. The lobby is actually below street level and a small counter. Staff super nice. Because the hotel is in a VERY urban area, you need key to use elevator and you aren't likely walking around the neighborhood alone at night. There's a variety good lunch time places around the hotel and I really loved Lucky Belly a couple blocks down on hotel street for excellent Asian fusion and cocktails. The hotel is also next to a Longs Drugstore and there is a 24 Hour Fitness on the corner where you get a great cheap day pass if you are a guest (I figured that out too late). The pool is large and on the 11th? floor. The rooms themselves have a stove top, microwave, mini fridge and cookware. If you are on island for multiple days, this is good. Rooms are fairly large where it looks like they glassed-in the lanai and made that a bedroom and then there's a table for eating and a desk. WiFi and coffee maker also included. There are basically 2 hotels downtown, the other one by the Ala Moana mall isn't setup for longer term stays. The bathroom had a jetted tub and was updated. You are downtown in a central location , so there is going to be street noise if you don't get high up. The Aston at the Executive Center is like a tool, if you are looking for a place downtown with (usually) one of the most competitive rates, it works. It is also a tiny bit closer to the airport than Waikiki.

I'll start with the positives before going into the nitty gritty details. To paint a picture, I stayed in the suite that sported a spare bedroom in the living room, a kitchenette with a stove and fridge along with utensils, and a bigger bedroom with what appeared to be a king sized bed.Pros: Very accommodating in terms of the living situation i.e. the kitchenette and the beds (my family was supposed to be coming to stay as well). The view was beautiful from the 21st floor and house keeping did a fabulous job in terms of making sure everything was in place and cleaned. Cons: Parking was a huge factor- $20 for parking/day seems a bit steep but then again, this is downtown Hawaii so I cannot really complain too much. My biggest pet peeve though is when I saw a cockroach walking around the floor in the morning across the kitchen. I am not from Hawaii- I am from Oregon where the climate is generally cooler and I don't think I have ever run into a cockroach there so needless to say I screamed rather loudly. After being informed by some friends who are from Hawaii that this is a normal occurrence, I still maintain that Aston at the Executive Centre did a great job to assist me with my move. That cockroach incidence is still burned inside my mind though especially being on the 21st floor...

They just can't seem to get it right: the hotel cards/keys do not work and I was stuck near the top of the 33+ story hotel and could not enter the room.  The paint was peeling off the ceiling in the bathroom, and my receipt was printed in a confusing manner and the promised corrected copy was not emailed to me as promised. The room carpeting is commercial quality, and was lower grade. The desk was chipped and had seen better days.This is not a place for couples or family. It is in and out, and nothing more, so leave dreams of aloha and the beach back in Omaha. Be careful in the room: The rooms are oddly designed with a full, length sliding glass partition between the interior and the bedroom. Be sure to always keep the glass door open, or you could walk right into it, especially in the middle of the night on the way to the bathroom. This could be a big problem. The glass door needs to be marked so visitors can tell if it is closed or open, otherwise you can walk into it and perhaps break your nose.The room was uncomfortable and lacked a couch or sofa for sitting. It is either the three chairs in the main area, you have to sit on the bed. There was no where to sit comfortably and relax in this over priced unit. The personnel at the front desk were not particularly friendly and lacked aloha. Even with totally enclosed, air conditioned rooms, street noise was evident, especially after 6am.

The driver dropped us off on the street and departed. Nothing looked like a hotel. No doorman, no sign, nothing. Eventually, a passer by helped out... it is down the escalator. Not obvious so there is your first tip... down the escalator.Check in was fine, fast, and informative.

Not even an elevator to street level unless they called on for you, you got in and they sent you up. Odd is all. The room had massive floor to ceiling windows so the view was great.

We did not feel safe to go out after dark. There are NO.. none... restaurants to speak of. Yes, the have 20 or so shown but these are all store front, fast food type of places on a dirty street.

I'm from Hawaii and stay here quite often. This place is unique in that the units are Privately owned and the Hotel manages them so the rooms may not all be identical and some may be recently renovated while others not. Part of this place is actually a condo so there are individuals that live here its not 100% a hotel but more of a combination. But regardless I've always had clean and cozy rooms. If you are from the mainland and attending business downtown this is a great place to stay since its right on Bishop Street and walking distance to most of the businesses. For locals I'd recommend staying over Saturday-Sunday because the parking is only 8$/night. There is NO valet service this is all Self Parking. Usually its 20$/night with in/out priviledges. These are both cheaper than Waikiki Parking which runs 25$-35$/night. I love this place because of the convenience to many new food places downtown. You can walk to Lucky Belly, Bar 35, HASR etc..very close and Longs and Ross's is right downstairs. There's also 7-11 and Starbucks downstairs and if you belong to 24 hr Fitness, its downstairs and walking distance. All units have at least a refrigerator/micro so its good to pick up items and store them in the room. There's also a coffee maker and they provide the coffee. The front desk people are very accommodating and friendly. There is a restaurant/sports bar Hukilau downstairs which is really good but they are NOT open on the weekends, but mainly serve lunch/dinner on the weekdays. This is a good place to have a few drinks and watch sports. The pool is pretty big and the jacuzzi is nice. The beds are very comfortable and all of the tubs are those larger types that have jet streams which is perfect with bubble bath.

That is, there are commercial, residential (longer term apartments, furnished or unfurnished, or condos), and hotel spaces. The residents have green cards, as do most of the commercial owners/renters. With 41 floors (the top floor being the management company that handles the higher floor long-term apartments) and its unique shape, the rooms offer an array of views. Please be aware that only certain apartments have the harbor view regardless of floor. For example, the mountain, or mauka (towards the mountains) side will obviously have a view of the mountains. Some hotel spaces will have both the mountains and the harbor, or a pure city view. All the spaces I've seen have been comfortable and spacious, especially compared to what you would find in Waikiki. Parking is in the building at a high rate in a tight garage, but cheaper at the nearby Aloha Tower Marketplace. Park in front of the marketplace for shorter term, or on the side for longer term. (Just follow the signs.) Nearby restaurants that are a must would include Little Village Noodle House or Lucky Belly (limited menu - appetizers and ramen) in Chinatown for the traditional in the group, or Maunakea Marketplace for the more adventurous (don't be scared by the hole in the wall look - the food is amazing). If you want to eat over by the harbor at Aloha Tower Marketplace, I would suggest Gordon Biersch - they have a wide variety of food, not just German, and some great beer. The views are great, and don't forget to peek into the harbor right by the bus stop in front (with the signs describing the fish) - it's supposedly the cleanest harbor on the island, and it shows with the clear water, beautiful tropical fish, and bright coral right over the side. Service is great at the hotel, with friendly folks that would tell you some of the same things. Guests will be given a map of the area, so you can find some of the things I mentioned if you're interested. I would not stay anywhere else if I wanted to scope out Chinatown/downtown or spend the night out (e.g. The Dragon Upstairs - a really cool bar). All in all, stay here!! Oh, and remember one tip - each room will have black bottoms on the windows. You can tip these up with your foot or your hand to allow for air flow in the apartment from outside if you get tired of the central air. This obviously lets in the noise form outside, but sometimes it's nice to have a change. If it doesn't come easily, pull on it a little harder - they're metal, so they're sturdy.","Raleigh, North Carolina","Thedrstwo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Raleigh, North Carolina</strong>",103,5.0

As such it is the obvious choice for many business travelers coming to Oahu and my recent trip was for business as well. However, having stayed both in Waikiki and Downtown now, there might be reasons to consider this hotel for vacationing as well.But first, about the hotel. The Executive Centre is a condominium tower built in 1981. I noticed plenty of apartments that were not equipped with a key-card entry and are thus never rented out to hotel guests, so expect to meet long-term residents when you head up and down the elevator.Given that these are condos they might vary quite a bit in terms of the interior. My room was a little dated, but more importantly it was clean and nothing was too worn out. Although it was a studio layout it was quite spacious with a kitchen area (fridge, microwave and coffee maker -- no stove), couch and working desk when you entered. The comfortable king size bed was at the end of the room by the floor-to-ceiling window that stretched along the entire width of the room.While some may not find this as charming as a view of the beach, I found the sunrise over Honolulu harbor quite enjoyable. I had a room on the 38th floor (of 41 total), so definitely try to get a room on a high floor to enjoy that view.The room was equipped with wireless high speed internet accessible with a code provided by the front desk. The speed was indeed quite impressive, much better than your typical free WiFi at most hotels these days. The flat screen TV was smallish but just fine and why watch a lot of TV anyway when you're in Hawaii?The building itself houses a restaurant and drugstore and since you're in the middle of downtown, nothing is far away -- except for the beach. So if you're a beach bum definitely stay away from here, but otherwise you may enjoy the numerous dining options with plenty new restaurants that are quite exciting compared to most of the established places in Waikiki. It might be wrong to ever refer to Hawaii as 'cheap', but compared to Waikiki, downtown Honolulu is very reasonable priced, especially if you venture into some of the restaurants in the Chinatown area, which is just a few blocks from the Executive Centre.A few favorites from my past trip:Lucky Belly, 50 N. Hotel StreetLittle Village Noodle House, 1113 Smith StThe Pig and the Lady, 83 N. King StAnd if you're looking for a break from Starbucks and the Honolulu Coffee Co., try Downtown Coffee at 900 Fort Street Mall #100.

The halls are narrow and the walls look worn and forlorn. The room was large but the sparse furnishings gave it an odd and sad feel. For business travelers being away from home and staying in a hotel is not a pleasant novelty and thus the lodging should soften rather than exacerbate the stress of being away from home.

There are a few odd features which I think are largely associated with the fact that the building the hotel is in is a mixture of condominiums that people live in and hotel rooms. So each floor is a mix of both and the rooms are configured a little oddly for a hotel room as a result. When you open the door to your room there is a very small galley like kitchen with a cooker, fridge and microwave which is handy, but there's no kettle and no toaster, so you end up boiling water in a saucepan and toasting toast in a fry pan. Coming from a country where tea is drunk as often as coffee, this seemed a little odd, but nothing you couldn't get around. There is then this long room connecting the kitchen area with the bedroom, with a desk in one corner. So other than the desk it's a rather large empty space which you end up not utilsing at all. The bedroom however has floor to ceiling windows and mine had the most amazing views out over the harbour. There's very little noise travel from other rooms, which is a high priority for me, so big ticks there. I didn't use the pool on site, but there is a restaurant/bar on the same floor as the lobby. The other odd thing about the hotel is that you go down a set of escalators to get to the lobby, only to get into the lift and go up to your room. Again, not a big deal, but just a little odd. Staff are friendly and efficient and happy to help. The hotel is close to chinatown so there's lots of small restaurants, take aways, small bars etc close by.

We left the beach in an ambulance and were eventually airlifted to Queens Memorial Hospital in Oahu. After the first night in the hospital it was evident that my husband needed to rest, and that for me to care for him I needed to rest as well. The island was hopping and there were virtually no options for last-minute logging, but thanks to Kathy at Queens Memorial and Collin at the Aston Executive Centre a room was found for two nights, and at an extremely reasonable price at that!When I checked in that afternoon Collin was so compassionate to what I was going through, and rest assured I was a mess trying to hold it together. And it didn't stop there!! My Aston ""Angel Crew"" as I call them would eventually grow to include Darrin, Chris, Neil and Flo...and how can I ever thank them for treating me as Ohana (family) instead of ""just a guest"" and doing just a few of these things:~Telling me the day before I thought I needed to check out (with nowhere to go) that they had cleared a room for me as long as I needed it!~To be waiting with a wheelchair (they went to the storage room and found one for me!) when the taxi brought my husband ""home"" from the hospital.~To not accepting a tip when helping me get all our luggage out of a taxi when we finally got it shipped in from the Big Island because her tip was that my husband was going to be okay (little tiny Flo wrestling those big golf bags and suitcases - she would of made you proud)!~To giving me a hug when I thought I was going to lose it!~And so many other random acts of kindness I can't name them all!!Three weeks later we find ourselves at home and the husband is doing absolutely amazing!! We feel truly blessed to be where we are, even though there is much to work thru in the ensuing weeks. It is truly heartfelt that we wouldn't of gotten this far without the help we received in the beginning from the Aston Angel Crew and I can't say Thank You enough to the fine folks I mentioned in this email.We have been guests at Aston properties numerous times over the years and have always been treated well. When things settle down I am taking my husband back to the island of Maui (no more Big Island action) to finish our vacation and make peace with the ocean.

We selected this hotel because of its close proximity to the cruise ship terminal. We arrived at 1am and left only 10 hours later for our cruise but it was fine for what we needed which was really just a place to sleep for the night between our flight and our cruise. The location is great if you don't want to be in the crazy Waikiki area or if you need something a little closer to the airport but not AT the airport. The room was big and clean but very dated, I think the whole hotel could use a refurb. There was a washcloth hanging over the shower head, I’m not sure if it was there to stop leaks or what but it was at least clean so we just left it. It didn’t affect the water pressure, which was fantastic but I wasn't really pleased with the bed. It was too springy for my taste and I could almost feel the bed move when my husband breathed but beds are very personal. Otherwise, everything was tidy and the suite had a large convection/microwave, stove, fridge/freezer and plenty of dishes, etc, as well as a little dining area and sitting area outside the actual bedroom. There was also a little table and chairs in the bedroom but no balcony. Plenty of room to spread out if you’re staying for more than a day or so. We were there on a Saturday morning so it wasn’t too busy but there wasn’t much in the way of early morning breakfast choices. There is a Starbucks very close as well as a McDonalds and probably more choices during the week and for other meals. It is within walking distance of the water and there’s a Longs Drug Store in the same building block.Since we were only there for a few hours, I can't speak to the amenities, I think there was a pool and there was a restaurant in the lobby but I don't know if it was open at breakfast on a Saturday. This is certainly not what I would call a luxurious hotel but the few staff members we met were friendly enough and if you want or need a place with a kitchen or a place to stay for a stop-over, close to the cruise ships, this is certainly an adequate hotel. One big thing to note, the lobby of the hotel is actually downstairs and not very well marked, especially if you’re arriving in the dark. There’s an escalator right in front of the building, right by the side walk, but it wasn’t at all obvious that we were supposed to take it to the lobby so we wandered in circles a couple of times before we noticed the little sign and went down.","Vancouver, Canada","JnTTravelots</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",36,3.0

Nothing was a problem no matter what we asked them and they were always ready with maps and suggestions at any time of the day.Yes the downtown area does have lots of homeless people at night but we were aware of this beforehand and were very careful - we never felt threatened at any stage though. Transport wasn't a problem into Waikiki as the bus stops literally right outside the hotel. There's buses every 5 minutes and costs $2.50 for the trip. This took between 20 and 30 minutes depending on the time of day.If you want something away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki this place is great. There's plenty of places to eat nearby.

The other advantage of staying at the business centre is that the partying tourists tend to stay at the tourist hotels so it is quieter at the Aston.The disadvantages are: navigation and parking fees. There isn't a convenient place to temporarily park, check in and unload. There are no bellhops to assist you with directions or your luggage. If it wasn't for the help from a Aston employee on break who noticed the lost expression on my face, I would not have figured out how to get to the lobby since the escalator was out of service. Aston's management has a 10 minute teaser 'free' parking rate. There isn't any way you can find a parking space, check in and drop off your luggage in 10 minutes.

The rooms are spacious and views outstanding. The one trip advsior who said the daily continental breakfast was meager was being generous. Pretty pathetic and no protein (unless you count peanut butter packets or cream cheese). Anyway, over the days I figured out what I could eat besides donuts which I cannot eat at all.The biggest downside is that the rooms are really dated. I always avoid places that are described as ""clean"", but these are. The rooms are huge and with just a facelift, they could be easily become outstanding. Over the days of my stay, the place did grow on me. Nice having a kitchen and the place is really quiet. Very little traffic noice from the streets below from higheer floors (downtown shuts down at night). The building is obviously concrete which adds to the quiet living space.For anyone visiting the Queens Medical center, the location is perfect! Easy walking distance. Also, for tourists, only one block to the Iolani Palace and the old Hawaii Theater. The biggest downside for a woman traveling alone is that downtown is NOTwalk-able at night. Some shady people and areas. If you don't want to lock down in your room after dark (which is unfortunately 7:00 pm) - don't stay here. If you are on business and doing work and going to bed - it is fine. I kind of miss the Waikiki shopping and walking after dark. I will have to catch a daylight bus to enjoy that at some time during the trip. Also, due to the no walking after dark - the dining experiences are limited. Waikiki has many more places to walk and eat after dark.So, overall - I would stay here again. It could be a good home base for some tourist trips. But if you want shopping and after dark eating.

After a few more days of exploring we realized that only 3 blocks SOUTH is a Gordon Beirsch and a Hooters. Obviously perfect places to get a burger and a beer.

Now, it's just kinda dated, tired and really not worth the money. This place needs a very serious and expensive renovation from top to bottom. But then again, since everything is so expensive in Honolulu, I'm not sure you're going to get anything much newer at the same price.To start with, this suite-style hotel has popcorn ceilings in the rooms which just look really old, as do the carpets in the rooms, as do the kitchen cabinets and some of the furnishings. Secondly, the carpets in the hallways, the room doors, the halls, you name it...they all seem like they haven't been refreshed, repainted or replaced in many, many years. Quite a few of the carpets outside of the elevator doors have seriously ugly stains. The jacuzzi bath tub in my room didn't work and the cable modem, TV box and wifi box all were sticking out of a wall in the bedroom, in front of everything The card readers in the elevators and doors from the parking garage very often don't work, very frustrating.Parking in the parking garage attached to the hotel is frustrating, they often give you a space in a high floor so you have to drive around and around and around going up or down - plan on 5-8 minutes to get in and out of this garage. Oh and plan on spending $20 per night for parking, yikes.One positive, the views from high floors facing the Pearl Harbor or Waikiki can be nice, but the mountain view rooms are often blocked by next door skyscrapers.Fortunately, the staff are very friendly and helpful, although the could have explained the elevator system to me better. And, the first room they give me, on a high floor as per my request, clearly had a smoker in it before me - even though there were signs everywhere saying ""no smoking."" The rooms were clean enough and the cleaner who came in every day did my dishes for me, which was very nice (I left a nice tip). The breakfast on the 40th floor was very skimpy: donuts, bread, bagels and a couple of pieces of fruit - I've had much better breakfasts in a Holiday Inn for far less money. Last problem, this place is in the middle of downtown (not in Waikiki); there's not much to do here at night and the restaurants are all closed on Sundays and close early every other night except Friday and Saturdays. If you're here on business, fine - but you don't want to stay here for pleasure, believe me.If you can find another hotel that's newer and more close to the action at the same price - go for it.",San Diego,"Gregg W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",39,3.0

My choice was an epic fail.While it is closer to the Naval Base, you also have to deal with bumper to bumper traffic on H1 going downtown. Then downtown is like going through Manhattan. Then there's the parking. In a 12 story parking garage, maybe 10% of the spaces are NOT reserved. Then you have to take the parking elevator all the way down to the lobby and get on another elevator to the 99th floor to your room. Oh and parking is 20 bucks a night.The rooms are large, but unspectacular. There was no view to speak of. Free internet was okay. Kitchenette was big enough. I was thoroughly disappointed with the very soft bed that offered little back support. The biggest disappointment is that downtown Hono. is downright scary. I used all of my street smarts to keep out of the way of groups of people that looked more than happy to separate you from your wallet. Nearly all the restaurants were closed. I walked a pretty long way just to find a so-so pizza joint. The hotel is not worth $280 a night. It should be at Govt. per diem at most. It's not for families. Definitely not for families.

The higher up your floor is, the better. However, what I really like about the hotel is the location. It's right next to China Town and in the middle of the business district. It's a really funky location with a huge selection of restaurants and little alleyways. You will find some homeless people late at night. I did not feel unsafe (I was alone), however, and they never bothered me. I highly recommend this hotel for outer island people visiting someone at Queen's Medical, this hotel is within an easy 10 minute walk.

Bad: poor signage to find the lobby, wifi only on 40th floor--have to direct connect in your room, breakfast of fruit and toast or pastry was very disappointing -- had to go to a restaurant for a real breakfast, room was very dated, 'ocean' view was not worth the surcharge, TV remotes do not work (switched out 2-3 times).

The room where they have the continental breakfast on floor 44 has a spectacular view of the ocean, harbor and mountains. We walked around downtown and saw the sights in the area. Hung over the fence and listened to a concert that was part of a corporate being held at the Iolani Palace--on the mainland security would have thrown us out. We walked in the steps of McGarrett (the old Hawaii 5-O) and Magnum--and saw many of the iconic locations used in the programs.

I stayed here because it was within walking distance to my client. In this property, the suites are individually owned, but the property is managed by the Aston hotel group. As a result, there may not be consistency between rooms (one room may be newer, the next older). If you get an unsatisfactory suite, just ask the front desk for a different one.The suite I stayed in was clean and comfortable. It was on the 22nd floor and had a decent view of the city, some ocean, and some mountains. The bed was comfortable and clean king-size, the TV was flat-screen LCD. Room number was 2204. One negative note: The hallway on floor 22 was consistently smelly, musty. The room was not, however.The property is conveniently located in the center of downtown Honolulu. I would only stay here for business reasons - this is not a hotel that you would want to stay in on vacation - it would require a bus, car, or taxi ride to any tourist location.

STAFF: Excellent. Very polite, ready to assist, and were very welcoming. Due to my long stay, most staff members cheerfully greeted me by my last name each time I passed one of them. There is also 24 hour security and a parking attendant, which made me feel safe. In all, the staff and management are extremely accomodating to whatever needs you may have.BUSINESS OFFICE: Just make sure you grab computer paper from the front desk as they never seem to stock up the printer nor do they leave extra paper for refills.BREAKFAST: Just simple pastries and drinks. Don't expect a Marriott Hotel breakfast spread....nowhere near it!ROOMS: I stayed in 2 different rooms. The first was not one of the newly renovated ones. Since each unit is either privately owned or owned by the hotel chain, each room is different in decor. My initial room was not great. The walls were peeling, bathtub/sink counter was old, kitchen was old with old appliances, and the washer/dryer was extremely old. In fact, the washer worked correctly sometimes and when it did, boy did it rattle. So much so that I had to hold the thing down so it wouldn't rattle itself out of the closet! Everything in the room including the paint and color of certain fixtures did not match. The room was not great and I wish I could remember the unit number. On the plus side, no insects and no smoke odors.My second room, which I stayed in for the last 2 months of my trip was much better. Up-to-date kitchen and appliances, bathroom was a lot cleaner and renovated to include a brand new bathtub. Washer/dryer was almost brand new and made little to no noise during operation. The only downfall was that someone on this floor smokes. This is a non-smoking facility which needs to be better monitored. Due to the smoker on this floor, floor 28, I was unable to use my AC in the unit as the smoke odor would fill my unit which made breathing unpleasant. Since there are no windows you can open, this made matters even worse, especially on hot days. The staff graciously set up a portable AC which I used for the duration of my stay. Still, I can smell the smoke when entering the floor or entering the room since housekeeping left the AC on throughout the day.So in all, request for an updated room. The view is always key however, the cleanliness of the unit is more important.BEDS: Please get new beds for all units!!!! It was like sleeping on cardboard. VERY firm beds. Too firm which caused back aches.POOL: Not great. Just a simple, small pool you would see at a typical apartment complex.INTERNET: Hard connection available however, they lack wireless internet. Hopefully, they upgrade their services regarding this issue.LOCATION: Perfect for the business person. Starbucks within 3 minutes, plenty of food choices, Aloha Tower just down the way, and Chinatown just a few blocks up....all within short walking distance. A major plus was the Longs Drugs store, Ross, and Macy's that are literally 1-2 mins from exiting the hotel. The bad part is that these places close at the lastest 6pm if not earlier.Great stay if you're looking to avoid the Waikiki traffic. Not on the beach or near a beach however, the panoramic view from the rooms are amazing.

Donuts, pastries, bread (for toasting), juice, and coffee are provided. Also, some bananas and apples as well.Hotel self-parking is fairly straightforward: enter the parking garage (the entrance is on Bishop -- which is a one-way street running north-to-south -- just past the hotel entrance). Pull in, grab a ticket from the machine, search for any open parking space that does not have its own individual ""reserved"" sign, and park. When you check-in, the front desk clerk will give you a plastic (RFID) card with unlimited in/out privileges. Return that card to the front desk at final check-out for a final ""pass"" to exit the parking garage/tower. No problems with parking at all.They have a ""business center"" up on the 40th floor as well. However, it consists of a single computer with a single printer. That's all. It is sufficient for printing your boarding pass, but not much more than that -- find a local copy shop if you need to produce any high-volume items.The restaurant/bar in the hotel lobby had a good menu and a nice local beer selection. It was fine for the one meal that I enjoyed there and had a decent ""happy hour"" scene.While my personal preference would have been to have stayed in a beachside hotel, business needs dictated that I stay downtown.

If you can get past this - you're fine.- The restaurant downstairs isn't open on weekends (downtown shuts down)- The downtown area turns into a virtual ghost-town after 6 (BUT - the nearby Aloha Towers shopping center has a brewery and Hooters, and several restaurants are open).- The complimentary breakfast is fairly plain and carb heavy (coffee/juice, variety of patries, bagels/toast, fruit, granola bar/rice krispie bar) but is restocked about every 30 minutes and the Kona coffee is tasty- Wired internet in rooms but not wireless (only in breakfast area)- You HAVE to contact them before arriving if driving to figure out your assigned parking spot to prevent a painful check in (no streetside lobby)- Elevators for main tower then transfer to different elevator for parking garage - makes last minute ""i forgot..."" a little painful- No real ""business center"" but they happily print off documents at the front desk when neededPROS:- Everything else.- They were ready for my arrival, efficient and friendly check-in- I was VERY impressed with my room upon arriving - clean, bright, SPACIOUS, well-equipped kitchen, flat screen TVs, (couch vs love seat would have been nice..but minor), big bedroom, and well-equipped room (full kitchen w/ full fridge and stove, desk, living room, washer/dryer, safe, ironing board/iron, safe, tvs)- Ocean (and breakfast room) view overlooks the harbor and towards HNL. Not Waikiki scenic, but still a great view of the ocean, downtown, and to the north (ewa beach and pearl city)- Quiet rooms (I know I had neighbors but NEVER heard them)- VERY comfortable beds- Weekly maid service (I don't like daily - no need for it) and available trash dumps on each floor - Friendly staff that were always smiling and ready to help- Convienent for working out (24 hr fitness around the corner, and easy to run along Nimitz Hwy towards Waikiki for a no-traffic and scenic run)- Awesome location for downtown shopping/eating/coffee houses etc- You can exit the H-1 after the Airport at Nimitz Hwy and take that to the hotel instead of sitting in the HEAVY traffic at the H-1/H-201 mergeI'm missing a million things after a 2+ month stay, but I couldn't have been happier. Staying here gave me all the conviences of an apartment allowing me to buy groceries and stretch my budget - allowing me to enjoy my stay in Honolulu and freeing up money for fun.

Rooms were spacious with small kitchenette, dining table, and separate bedroom. Now comes the bad news: the unit I stayed was the ""older"" units. It had roaches in the bathroom and its window rattled each time wind blew. I'm not sure if the windows weren't properly sealed, but I couldn't sleep well with all the howling wind and windows rattling each time. And seeing a roach in the bathroom first thing in the morning, especially after not such good night sleep, surely is not a way to start a day. I was told the place had full occupancy and could not give me a renovated unit.

My company usually sticks me at the Executive Centre and from my past experiences, I have to say that this is my favorite hotel to stay at. The rooms are all very nice and clean, wonderful view no matter which part of the hotel you end up at-one whole side of the room is all glass so you get that spectacular view. Very roomy and not small like most other hotels-you get your own bedroom-its more like a condo than a hotel, convenient, covered parking (not open like some other hotels so you can stay dry if its raining), free internet, nice big flat screen tv's (one in your bedroom and another in the living room), nice long bar, full kitchen, dishwasher, washer/dryer, jacuzzi in the bathroom as well, very nice facilities, elegant lobby, big pool and jacuzzi, and the location is just perfect. Work is just a 3 min walk across the street. And, there's a Longs, Ross's, Price Busters at the bottom of the hotel so you don't even need a cab if you need to buy anything. Also many good eateries near by-all within walking distance. There's even a bar/restuarant downstairs which has pretty good food. Aloha Tower is just a 10 minute walk away. If you do need to get around, the bus stop is also at the base of the hotel, so you can save money instead of catching a cab. Takes about a 20 min bus ride to Waikiki and 30 min bus ride to Pearl Ridge (Although doesn't seem all that long). The staff is just awesome. Super friendly and goes that extra mile for me every single time I stay there. In fact, I was so impressed I decided to bring them a small gift from the Big Island - Big Island Candies. Even on personal trips I don't even think for a second about where I should stay, I already know that my choice will be the Executive Centre. You pay a little more, but I think it is definitely worth the price. As I said, I really feel like ""THE MAN"" when I stay here.

We also stayed 3 nights each at the Hawaii Prince Waikiki and the Maui Coast Hotel.Our stay at the Hawaii Prince was so enjoyable that we almost tried to stay there for our last 3 nights rather than at the Executive Centre. In retrospect, I'm glad we tried both hotels. Our situation is different from many visitors because our son is a college student and lives several blocks from the Executive Centre.Our suite was on the 37th floor, and we did have mountain views as advertised. We also enjoyed the port views from the 40th floor breakfast room each morning. The suite was clean and comfortable, although the bathroom was a bit outdated and the shower could have used a massage head. We appreciated the free internet access, continental breakfast, and easy parking. Continental breakfast did lack cereal, but there were many types of pastries and fresh fruit available every day.I have not read every review posted here, but we went to three places that are favorites of my son and his friends. Murphy's Bar & Grill and O'Toole's Irish Pub are on opposite corners of Nuuanu Avenue and Merchant Street. JJ Dolan's is another bar that has excellent pizza. Murphy's is great for steaks and other foods, and O'Toole's has entertainment on Saturday nights.Some reviews mention unfriendly customer service at the desk. My experience is the complete opposite. I did something stupid when checking out - I left my wallet at the front desk. I had removed my parking pass and room key and then turned to my wife to get her key. Somehow I did not put my wallet back in my pocket. We then went to the garage and where loading our carryon bags when the desk clerk came running after me with my wallet. I really appreciated this.In summary, the Executive Centre is not a Waikiki resort hotel, but it deserves consideration by anyone who wants to stay in the downtown area.","Coupeville, Washington","RichVolk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coupeville, Washington</strong>",21,4.0

It is a great location, perfect actually. It is convenient and the service is great. However, staying here last month I noticed COCKROACHES. I cannot stand cockroaches. I despise them like most people, hence why I only gave a three star rating. I ran into a few people on the elevator, who were residents, and I asked them about the cockroaches. They said they have noticed them a lot more lately. In their apartments and outside, mainly in their kitchens. This made me realize that this is not the hotel or the housekeepers fault (necessarily). I really would HIGHLY recommend that the building management/crew/staff take control of this problem. One resident told me they vacuum and clean daily, have roach traps throughout the kitchen, spray, and STILL see some around the kitchen area. Thats not a good thing. I apologize for my rant about cockroaches but this hotel is so perfect (other than this) and the cockroaches are so nasty its just hard not to rant.

I had looked into Oakwood and all of their properties, but was turned off by their requirement that I sign a 30 day lease. When I balked, they told me that the only extended-stay place I would find that would be like an apartment, but rent for less than 30 days would be a condo-tel. I started my search for what a condo-tel was, and found the Executive Center. I then came to this site to get the real deal on this hotel . I was alarmed by the extreme polarization in the reviews. I didn't know if to believe the good reviews, wondering if they were planted by hotel staff, or the bad reviews which might be people who had an agenda. Whatever your reason for coming here to research this hotel, you're looking to have your expectation set.First thing you should understand (and this should help put some of the other reviews in perspective) is that the building is a mixed use building. This means that there are offices, apartments, and hotel rooms all in the same building. Also known by industry folks as a ""condo-tel"" Some people buy a unit, and use it for their office. Some people buy condos and live in them, and some bought condos that they turned over to the hotel (Resort Quest) to manage. Remember - each room (unit) is owned by an individual owner, whereas all rooms in a regular hotel are owned by the same owner! This explains why some rooms are good, some are great and others are spectacular. It's up to each owner to decide how much to invest in their unit. RQ sets the standards, and if the owner doesn't comply, their unit gets dropped from the roster, but it's still up to the owner.That said - I've had 3 stays over 3 months. Some highlights, and lowlights:- The hotel is downtown, and downtown dries up after 6pm. All of the folks downtown seem to be pretty much in government, banking, or students are one of the numerous schools downtown, so they disappear early.- There is a Longs Drugstore next door to the hotel entrance. Huge selection that almost doubles it as a mini grocery store. It does close early (6pm) as another person stated.- Subway, McDonalds directly across the street, and Jack In The Box 1 block away. All close fairly early though (I think 6ish also)- Safeway grocery store, and 24 hour Longs Drugs are 4 blocks away. Easy walk.- Aloha Tower and Marketplace are also 4 blocks away. There, you'll find a Gordon Biersch Brewery, a Hooters, and a few other restaurants. Decent eats, I was there alot!- The Bus (the local transit system) stops at the entrance to the hotel. Just about every route that goes anywhere you'll think to go stops there, and can get you just about anywhere you're headed in 20'ish minutes. I did get bad instructions from folks at the front desk on 2 occasions about which bus to take, though. Easy enough to double check with the bus driver when in doubt.- Continental breakfast on the 40th floor is nice. Someone else said that they run out of food and don't replenesh. I didn't experience that in my 3 months there. I went late every morning to avoid the crowd, and there was always still food left. Juice and coffee are plentiful. Good views, and computer with internet access is up there also.- Each time I went home (for between 4 and 11 days) I was able to leave my luggage with them so that I wouldn't have to pay bag fees to the airlines to take my bags home. It was nice to be able to travel light for my trips home.- Parking - yes, it is in the parking garage next door to the hotel. There is no valet, but you do get in and out privs. Parking is assigned, so to avoid having to go back to move your car after checking in, call the hotel on your way from the airport, and have them give you your space number.Bellman - Nope - no bellman. Remember - this is an office building with some ""managed"" condos! If you park your car, and go check in, they have a luggage cart so you can haul your stuff in - quite easy! Or, if you call the desk on your arrival, they'll come out and help you, but no one is stationed outside full time.Apartment. All of the furniture in the units I was in were current, up to date. Decent beds. Clean! Kitchens and baths are like others said - some are dated. Tile countertops instead of granite. Dated cabinets. Tile and tub colors are dated. Desk was nice. High speed internet was speedy. Washer and dryer in the unit also nice. Has a full size fridge, stove, and microwave. Someone said that the microwave was on a cart. Remember what I said about individual owners! To each owner, his own! My unit did not have a cart. And come one - really - you're not buying the unit, you're just there to have somewhere to put your stuff and sleep!Bugs - someone mentioned that there are supersized roaches in Hawaii. They weren't lying! I saw a 6"" centipede at one of my customer's offices! Literally! Good part - no bugs IN the hotel - not in 3 months I was there!Restaurant - yes, there is one in the hotel. The usual sports-bar type food and drinks. Pretty good, actually! Burgers are awesome.Chinatown - 4 block walk. And definately an experience.Waikiki - it's not. If you want the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, you should stay down there. I was here to work, and I don't like crowds. Perfect for me! None of the Waikiki traffic, endless thumping music from cars, nightclubs and bars, and still nice views of the water and mountains. You can get there on the bus in 20 mins though! Don't drive down there if you can help it. If you want the action of Waikiki, stay here, go to the action, then come back here for some peace!Airport - close. And way closer than Waikiki - cheaper cab ride if you don’t rent a car.Management - cares. The GM of the hotel addresses each and every post on here. Since he posted his name and email address, I took the time to call him and ask him about all of the negative feedback on here before my first stay, and he took the time to set my expectation as I'm doing here for you. Once my expectation was set, everything was smooth sailing. How many hotel GM's do that!?!?!?! I asked him to back up his claims, and he emailed me pictures of the room I was booked in, and guaranteed in writing that if the room was unacceptable when i checked in, that I could cancel my reservation and check back out and get a full refund. I'll bet he'll do it for you too.Sketchy - I saw someone said that about the neighborhood. I'm from Atlanta. All downtowns get ""sketchy"" after the people leave. If you mean that it gets very quiet, and there's noone around, then you're right. But I never felt unsafe, and I walked to Safeway every night to pick up frozen dinners.Room jacuzzi - dated color, but the hotel's jacuzzi on the 11th floor is much bigger, more powerful, and gives views of the open sky.All in all, an excellent experience. I’ll be staying there again on my next project with the same customer next month.",Atlanta,"Binlurkin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta</strong>",15,5.0

The good points: Location, location, location. This is the only choice for downtown. You are walking distance to the Aloha Tower Marketplace, and essentially in Chinatown. There are lots of restaurants nearby, though it can be a challenge to find the good ones as there are also a lot of cheap (though also often good) small eateries. The heart of Chinatown has several markets with a great selection of fruit. But no beach. None. Nada. Zip.If I only need to work in Honolulu for one day, or maybe two, I will stay in Waikiki and take a taxi in to town. But if I need to be there for extended business, I will stay at the Executive Center.The rooms are generally apartels, with kitchenettes. Some have a full kitchen and a washer and dryer. If you will be there for an extended stay and your unit does not have a washer and dryer, you can ask to be moved. While the hotel has differing levels of room, I have found that it does not matter what you select, you can end up in any one of a wide variety of rooms, though I always spring for the ocean view.As far as a gym, on the same block is a 24 hour fitness. The hotel sells daily passes, but I usually just sign up for a week or month with the club.For local dining, it is about a 4 block walk, but make sure you go to Duc’s Bistro.

I live on Kauai but travel to Oahu on business from time to time. The first time I had a high room... just below the top floor. The most recent time I stayed on floor 29.First off, the location will appeal to business travelers only, since it is in downtown Honolulu. Tourists should not stay here. There are few tourist attractions in the area, and there are so many other better places for a tourist to stay on the island.This hotel is wedged somewhere between ""past its prime"" and ""not very nice."" It has probably been like this for years though. The building is nice enough... a modern looking high rise with a nice clean lobby. The rooms have seen better days. The two rooms I stayed in were laid out the same, but the furnishings were completely different. In both cases, everything was dated by at least a couple decades. The tile, cabinets, tub, everything. Also, you'll notice evidence of reconfigurations... by this I mean air vents that have been relocated, drywall patched, fixtures have been added, removed, etc. Ordinarily after a hard day at work I'd love to relax in a jacuzzi tub, but something about an old tub from the 70's doesn't really appeal to me. There is a kitchenette, and in my most recent case, the microwave was oddly on a microwave cart in the living area, well outside the kitchenette space.To sum it up, the rooms are out of date, but they are at least clean which is really the most important part to me. And while out of date, nothing is totally trashed. For example, the bedding clearly isn't from the 70's. The one odd thing from my last trip was that all my towels smelled funny. They were clean (I think), but the detergent must have been some odd industrial grade bleach or something.Travelers should be aware that most of the businesses near by close early. For example, the Longs drug store downstairs closes at an unbelievable 6PM. Aloha Tower Marketplace has plenty of dining and shopping though, and it is a reasonable walk of a few blocks.A lot of people stay in Waikiki for business. Depending on where you are working, Waikiki is often less convenient. But, it is a tradeoff, because at executive center you'll feel like you are staying at any old hotel on the mainland... not much of an Aloha theme.","St. Petersburg, Florida","Brian Y</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Petersburg, Florida</strong>",70,2.0

The Executive Centre Hotel is all business and no aloha. The rooms are fine- the same as any other business hotel, though ours had a spectacular view of the harbour. No windows open, which I HATE, but the canned air didn't smell bad or anything. There is a full sized fridge and a small cook space and a real kitchen sink. It had a tiny washer and dryer, with ""international symbol"" instructions that I needed help interpreting. I called the front desk for help, who directed me to the housekeeping department (why?). The housekeeping guy spoke such poor English that he had to send someone up to demonstrate. (My question, for the record, was ""does the soap go in the right, left, or center compartment?"") There is chain-store shopping right at the bottom of the building, including Longs and Ross Dress for Less (which has a huge selection of Hawaiian shirts and dresses for $10-$20, instead of $30+ you'll pay at the tourist shops.) The neighborhood has zero personality and they're working hard to keep it that way. The staff is brusque and business-like. (Someone told me that they were trying to undo the surfeit of personality it had had 10 years before when it was a red light district.) The people who came to clean the room were very nice, though didn't speak English well. What convinced me to never stay there again was the young security guard who told me and an old woman that we couldn't sit on the granite front ledge while we waited for our taxis. ""Don't you see the sign? You can't sit here."" (Sure enough, there was a discreet sign fastened to the side of the building where we were sitting.) After staying a week on the Big Island it was truly shocking to see a young Hawaiian treat an older woman so disrespectfully. I am young and healthy, and standing for 20 minutes wasn't a terrible hardship, but what was the old woman supposed to do? There were no benches. There was no place else to sit. It was clear that the poor guy was was only enforcing hotel policy; the hotel should be ashamed of itself for having such a policy in the first place. Nevermind the inconvenience to me, one of its guests; by chasing off old ladies they are showing Hawaii to be ungracious and lacking in basic courtesy. For the record, this is the only occasion on my entire 10 day stay in Hawaii that I experienced anything like this.","Oakland,CA","November000</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland,CA</strong>",1,2.0

THERE IS NO ONE OUT FRONT TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR BAGS. The bathroom was clean, but the cabinet, flooring and wallpaper are the absolutely cheeapest you could buy anywhere, and are old. The toilet seat was one of those horribly cheap, thin plastic ones. There was NO exhaust fan in it so the steam from my shower went everywhere. Despite having pushed my thermostat all the way down and the a/c fan on HIGH it was never below 77 in my room. The mattress was very soft and gave me back trouble. Its been YEARS since I stayed in a hotel without a good mattress and didn't think they existed anymore. The continental ""breakfast"" is a joke - they put out a bag of whole wheat bread next to a toaster, a bag of bagels, a few muffins and something that looked like pound cake. VEry little fruit - just a few bananas and cheapo red delicious apples. There were machines with what appeared to be orange juice and some other thing but upon tasting it was clear these ""juices"" (""juice drinks?"") were from metal cans. Skip it and go half a block down Bishop St. to Starbucks where you can buy a cup of chopped fresh fruit and excellent juices. There is a Long's drugstore next door and it opens at 6:30 A.M. so you don't need to drag shampoo, conditioner, etc with you when you fly out to Honoloulu, just get it when you arrive. The staff at the front desk did their best for me, but this hotel is just a dump that desperately needs new mattresses, all new bathrooms, new room a/c systems and a lot of other things.

We were staying on the top floor of the hotel, and could hear very loud industrial fans on the roof of the building. Very annoying and disturbed our sleep. The neighborhood of the hotel is kind of sketchy, lots of drugged up and mentally ill homeless, just steps away from the hotel. Its fine during the day, but can get rather sketchy at night, and especially on the weekends, when downtown business crowd disappears.

We waited until the last minitute and was leary of staying at a place that did not show pictures of the facility on line. I read the reviews of other trip advisor members and they were mixed, some good some bad. We (my husband, myself, teenager son and another couple). decided to stay only 2 nights, even though we had a government discount rate. From the outside of the building, I thought the worst and was glad we were only staying 2 out of 5 nights. We stayed on the 38th floor. When the elevator door opened the hallway was really narrow and smelled a little mildew and again I thought, ""it's only 2 nights."" When we opened the door to our spacious 1 bedroom suite I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were large, the carpet appeared new, the king bed room had a great view of the mountains and the bed itself was really comfortable and inviting. The living room had a small sofa, but large enough to accomodate a cot for our growing teenager. The other 3 nights were stayed at a well known updcale popular hotel on Waikiki Beach. Other than the location on the beach, we wished we had stayed at the resortquest. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to other family and friends. The only mishap was the water stopped running the day we were checking out. The staff and manager got right on it and reimburst us $150 for the inconvience.

I was there for business reasons, and normally I would not care so much considering I did not pay for my stay, but I feel compelled to warn others. I won't go into details - I'll just give you highlights (lowlights?):Positives: Relatively inexpensive for Oahu, nice views of the city, very spacious room.Negatives: Oh where to begin ...1. The rooms are outdated and have a funky smell to them. The carpeting looked like it hadn't been vaccumed in years. TVs were small and very old. Outlets in bathroom did not work. Lightbulbs in bedroom were burned out. Bed was small and very uncomfortable. Kitchette was flat-out disgusting - I would have rather eaten off the street.2. The parking garage is unorganized and safety hazards abound. When emerging from and entering the garage, it is very difficult to see oncoming cars and pedestrians. My husband met me on the last day of my stay here before we moved to the Hilton Hawaiian Village (stay there - it's worth any extra $$$) and I was assured by the front desk that he'd be charged $12 for parking there as a non-hotel guest. He was charged $38 for parking less than 12 hours.3. Check-in is difficult as there is no place to park your car and you must go down an escalator from the street and then back-up the escalator to your (double-parked) car, up to the parking garage, down the elevator to the lobby, and then finally up a different elevator to your room. If you've stayed there, you know what I mean. It's a mess.4. Finally - and most upsetting - was the fact that a co-worker and I were stuck in the elevator for over an hour. It was extremely scary as the elevator was jerking and bucking for several minutes. The front desk worker contacted Security, who we had many conversations with through the little speaker in there, and did their best to get a technician to us ASAP. However, when the elevator doors finally opened, no one was there. I guess that wasn't a big deal, but when we walked over to the front desk to let them know that we were out and safe, the man did not even look up. We asked if we needed to do anything, and all he did was shake his head. NO ONE from the hotel EVER apologized or asked if we were OK. If that doesn't speak volumes to their customer service, I don't know what would. Bottom line: Do NOT stay here. Pay an extra $20-30 and stay some where nice.

Not the kind of thing you expect to see in an upscale ocean view suite. From what I understand, many of the rooms at this hotel are privately owned and Resort Quest only manages them.

This hotel is located in downtown, not far away from the Aloha Tower. It was a quiet location and perfect for our 1-night stay. We went in to Waikiki, but appreciated the quiet location downtown. We had a beautiful view of the harbor. Our room was very large and well-equipped. It had an entry foyer, a kitchen, living room, separate bedroom and full bath with jacuzzi tub. The juices available for purchase in the full refridgerator were only $1.50 per can! After a long flight, our party of 3 arrived at the hotel to find that the roll-away bed that we requested was not available. We were not advised that the roll-away bed was a request only and that one was not guaranteed to be available. (One may ask, why would the hotel think the customer would ask for a roll-away bed, if they don't really need one?) The hotel initially attempted to accommodate us by offering a room with double beds. This would not work for us, because 2 people in our party were over 6 feet tall. Darrin at the front desk was sympathetic to our dilemna and booked us an additional room on the same floor at no additional charge!!! Now that's customer service! NOTICE: The bedding options for the rooms are: 1 king or queen or 2 doubles. There are no sleeper sofas. If you REALLY need a roll-away bed (you have a third person or 2 of your party won't fit well in a double bed because they are over 6 feet tall), one may not be available. You should either book 2 rooms (expensive) or book someplace else. The continental breakfast is ok if you just need a quick bite to eat. There is also a McDonald's on the corner. I tried the he Hawaiian breakfast at McDonald's for fun (2 huge scoops of rice, Spam, porteguese sausage, and one other item that I can't remember.) Large!!! I would stay again.

When my supervisor told me I was going to Hawaii, I had planned/wanted to stay in Waikiki. Yet to stay within budget, my plans got redirected to the Aston Hotel Downtown Honolulu. After my stay however, I will always have a place in my heart for the Aston Hotel in Honolulu. I was sent to Hawaii for a 2 month long business trip and had the pleasure of staying at this hotel. This hotel is wonderful for those working in the downtown area. It is not in Waikiki (about a 10 min. bus ride) so if you are looking for a place with all the Waikiki happenings you should stay there. During the first two weeks of my stay I was in a suite with a beautiful mountain view. The smoke from a neighboring apartment became too much for me and I lucked out and was placed in an ocean view room. Both rooms were suites with a washer/dryer, kitchen, separate living room and a nice sized bedroom. I had modern furnishings in both suites with flat screen televisions in the living room and bedroom and dark brown wood furniture throughout the apartment. There are floor to ceiling windows which are great for seeing the mountains or the ocean on either side. It was beautiful going to bed and falling asleep with a view of the ocean or coming back to my room and watching the sunsets. It was fantastic!As far as the surrounding area, I found Chinatown to be interesting and a great place to buy a random selection of things. Aloha Tower is within walking distance and has several nice restaurants as well as a food court. There is a plaza by the hotel that has shops and restaurants and further down is a Safeway if you feel like cooking in the kitchen. The Bus stops right outside the hotel where you will be able to ride to Waikiki or Ala Moana Beach/Shopping Center. Other bus lines are within walking distance for making trips to Aloha Stadium and Pearl Harbor. There are also museums and other historical points of interest within walking distance as well. I made out well without a car but you must be a little adventurous. If you are a traveler who is unaccustomed to walking much or driving/riding the bus this place isn't for you and Waikiki may be a better bet. Personally, I enjoyed the location removed from the craziness of Waikiki and actually liked this hotel.","alexandria, va","chariega</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>alexandria, va</strong>",10,4.0

The accommodations weren't what I expect from an ""all-suite"" hotel -- no ""living room"" or seating area outside the bedroom to watch TV. Rooms are spacious but minimally furnished; standard room has a large kitchen dining area with only a small dining table. The bedroom, separated from the dining area by a doorless wall, has a bed, the TV and chair. The kitchen has a fridge and trash compactor; microwave available on request for a fee, and even the in-room coffee has a fee. The public area was beneath street-level, windowless and rather dreary. The check-in desk occupies a corner of the office building lobby, which was usually deserted during the weekend I stayed there. Use of the fitness center, accessible from the office building floors, required a special key from the front desk, although the info on it in the guest guide fails to mention this. The swimming pool is also accessible via the office building. Wouldn't be comfortable using them on the weekend, at least, since the office building floors were deserted.Maybe if you're conducting business downtown during the week, this would be an OK choice. But ANY dining on the weekends -- and these options are limited -- requires a walk of several blocks or a drive to pay parking. The hotel restaurant is only open for breakfast and lunch on weekdays, although the hotel lounge offers a free continental breakfast -- fruit, juice, bread and pastry, coffee - that sufficed.This place is a considerable distance from Waikiki, where the beaches, shopping, hotels, restaurants, etc. of Honolulu are located. It took me about an hour to drive through the traffic to get to Waikiki early Saturday night. There's no concierge service to speak of; in response to an inquiry at the check-in desk, I was simply handed one of the standard local guide magazines.Finally, and this is what led me to check out early and move to a hotel in Waikiki, I was not happy with security. My first night I was awakened in the middle of the night by a knock at the door, purported to be the delivery of pizza, that I hadn't ordered. The hotel elevator required a swipe of the keycard to access my floor, so the next morning I inquired at the check-in desk about how someone had gained access. I was told that they just card delivery people up since ""they can't know who ordered something"". Maybe call the room?Bottom line - the out of the way location, modest accommodations, and unease about security caused me to check out early in favor of more appealing accommodations for my business trip.","Tucson, Arizona","EatLikeABird</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tucson, Arizona</strong>",22,2.0

From this room, we had wonderful views of Honolulu Harbour and surrounding streets which, at night, were stunning. The suite was very comfortable and spacious and the kitchenette allowed us the flexibility of doing some ""home cooking"" and stocking up on supplies from Longs Drugs and Safeway Supermarket, both handy to the hotel. Chinatown was just down the road and Waikiki was a short trip away on ""The Bus"" which we used with a pass available from ABC Stores conveniently located on almost every corner in Waikiki. This bus service, right at the hotel, was convenient to trip around the island, to the North Shore and to Pearl Harbour.

The Aston is located in downtown Honolulu on Bishop Street, a few blocks from the Aloha Tower. I usually stay in the Waikki area when traveling to Hawai'i on business, but most of these hotels were booked due to a large convention in Honolulu during my stay.On the plus side, the room was clean and spacious and included a refrigerator, microwave oven, and dinnerware. The Honolulu paper was delivered each day. The Aston assigned me a parking space in the adjoining parking garage, eliminating any problem finding an available space in a busy garage. The staff were very friendly, professional and helpful during my stay.On the minus side, there was no restaurant in the hotel. A continental breakfast was served in a common room on the 40th floor, and it consisted of coffee, juice, breads and rolls. In-room Internet access was available via DSL modem for $10-11 additional per day. Wireless Internet access was also available in the common room on the 40th floor, and this room was locked after hours. You can get a room key (good for one day) at the front desk, and another guest explained the process to me.In short, a decent place to stay, but it lacks the amenities that a first-rate lodging for business travelers should provide.

The staff were great and the continental breakfast was okay, the view was great and the breakfast room had free wireless internet access so we could check our email on our laptap - always a bonus.

There is also a supermarket underneath the hotel.We were there for Mardi Gras and watched the parades in Chinatown and the Aloha centre - great fun. We also went on a whale watching trip in the Navatek which leaves from a pier near the Aloha centre (I suggest booking).
