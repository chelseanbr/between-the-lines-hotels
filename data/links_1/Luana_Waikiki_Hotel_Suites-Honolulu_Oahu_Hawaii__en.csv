So, when it came time to share it with the man in my life, he too said he found it to have an authentic Hawaiian feel. He also liked the view of the park from our lanai. It was his first time on Oahu, and it made the right impression (thank you).

Terrible crisis response from hotel upper management. Historically unexpected virus crisis, yes... but do not coldly strip away guest amenities without replacing it with kindness and aloha. This is not “sharing our concern.” Zero communication to guests. We calmly reported all matters to professional front desk staff and Aqua Aston reservations phone number yet no response or notice from on-site Luana manager. In time of need, hotels should step up hospitality not coldly rip it away from guests. Hand sanitizer (as mentioned by other review) not visible at lobby water station or anywhere near any elevators. One bottle behind front desk and 1 wet wipe can. Water stations missing from pool and lobby; at least put out free bottled water, the hotel is 90% vacant, it’s a crisis and guests are in need of supplies, support & resources. Cleaning staff drastically reduced, at least keep the cleaning staff onboard during a virus pandemic. No updates on the many local Waikiki closures or shelter-in-place declarations. Free shuttle hours 10:30am posted by management erroneously it’s still 8:30am. And no guest help from the hotel manager to get to supplies or food during this crisis. Free wine and cheese event can be substituted with room delivery to those that enjoy the hospitality. Just a nice Luana care package with practical emergency supplies would have been awesome. Basically if something goes down, you’re on your own folks. Glad to be home in the mainland, felt like a contestant on Survivor. Luana in the early 2000’s was top notch hospitality, I’ve stayed 3 times previous, but since new manager stepped in it hasn’t stepped up.","Vancouver, Canada","Petlov3r514</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",0,2.0

CAN I START OFF BY SAYING MAHALO TO ALL STAFF OF THIS HOTEL!! My husband & I just got married & we are celebrating our honeymoon here in Hawaii before moving to Japan. I am from the Philippines & so this is my first ever time here in the United States. What a great idea was it to not only come to Hawaii for our honeymoon. But staying in this hotel by far has been absolutely amazing! Everything from cleanliness, professionalism & customer service. I wish we never left!!!! I felt guilty because there was a guest behind me waiting to be served by your wonderful front desk staff. But their customer service was so great that they actually listened to my husband’s terrible dad jokes..... which I think they laughed a little too hard about because he’s really not that funny. But thank you Alexis, Kim & Martha for taking one for me and listening to him talk up a storm. The restaurant they have on property on the lobby level was as locals say “broke da mouth laddat” which I think means very delicious. So delicious in fact that I nearly had a “kanak attack” - I think means food coma because even if I was already so full, it was so good I ate it all.

My friends and I had a wedding to attend and because of the out of town guests, we decided to spend some time together in Waikiki. We chose the Luana because of the Location and also the affordable rates they had to offer. From the time we booked our reservations, to the day of check-in, and check-out, our expectations of their customer service were definitely exceeded! A special thank you to the Front Desk agents- Kim, Alexis, and Martha who helped us with our reservations from day one. They went above and beyond to help accommodate our large group and made sure we were taken cared of upon our arrival. We had two rooms, which were spacious and clean. They even accommodated an early check in and check out that we had requested, which we were informed was not guaranteed but based upon availability of the day of.

I moved to Oahu last Fall and stayed at Luana Waikiki over 2 months before I moved to my new house. I had plenty of hotel options in Waikiki and around the island but Luana won me. It is conveniently located in Waikiki and close to the beach, Ala Moana, and lots of restaurants. And most importantly the rates were reasonable and affordable. The rooms are individually owned but they do a great job maintaining them. There's Hook Cafe that offers some quality food...if you go there you must try the egg shooter..so yummy! The front desk staff was friendly and always willing to help. Martha at the reception always had a smile while greeting guests, and made you feel welcomed and acknowledged. If I had a hospitality or customer service business, I'd want people like Martha to be the face of my business. Very professional, gives one full attention, and always took the time to make sure my questions were answered. The hotel does a wine Wednesday where hotel guests get to drink wine and socialize. They have bbq grills and they offer fresh lime/cucumber water every morning. Overall I enjoyed my stay here and I've already recommended a few people to the hotel.

It was far enough away to be quite but close enough to go out and about. We had 2 kids 4 & 7 and they found the walk fine and very safe. We walked back late most nights and always felt safe and we didn’t see any homeless around the motel.The park is lovely and green and great to wake up to every morning. The walk to duke statue was a bit long if that’s where you wanted to swim but to go straight through the park wasn’t long to the beach. Plenty of shops to look at while walking to your destination and there is plenty of walking to be done if not in central Waikiki. Also being positioned where it is was great for the Waikiki Trolley. And it was also easy to walk down around Discovery bay which is a bit slower than The main area of Waikiki. I took a bike one morning which was great to get out and see the town a different way. Staff were all nice when we were coming and going. They have chairs and umbrellas which is part of the ammenities fee. The room was nice. It was very clean and comfortable, loved the bed. We had a 1 bedroom and we had 3 adults and 2 children and found it to have plenty of room. Asked for a few things during the stay and they were brought up really fast. Remember most of Hawaii keeps the traditional feel so things seem old but they aren’t and if they are old they are well looked after.We would stay here again for the price as it was cheaper than central Waikiki places but it definitely lived up to our high expectations.

I have older girls, so the couch was not the greatest, but the VIEW we had was worth it!! This hotel was our 2nd choice, but I am glad we ended up here! We did opt for the full kitchen suite. If we go again, I would say a kitchenette would suffice, as we only cooked breakfast one time. We were out exploring the island most of the days we were there. Even though we had to valet park each time, the valet attendants were all nice and helpful, shout out to Mr. James & Jesse! My daughter wanted me to mention alll of the employees and staff were very courteous, saying hello to us, asking if we needed anything on our way out. The Fish Hook Cafe was okay for grabbing quick pastries or lunch, but pricey. The food we did order all was tasty! The credit vouchers we received from the resort fee along with the promo we had received during booking allotted us enough credit for the cafe to grab a few meals/snacks for our days out on the island. Biggest downside to the Cafe was the limited hours, only open from 7a-2pm.Amenities: their pool area is a little small, but we never used it since the beach was only a 10 minute walk through the park. They did have a nice gym, but again, our exercise was out on the island lol. We did take advantage of the beach chairs, beach towels, and umbrella use for one of our excursions which is included in their resort fee. Traffic in this area was heavy for the most, but we were in a great spot. ","Chandler, Arizona","CaligurlNAz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chandler, Arizona</strong>",9,5.0

Huge kitchen, 2 bedrooms and a washer and dryer were so convenient. We booked an ocean view room and was upgraded to a bigger 2 bedrooms instead of 1 but t no ocean view. The only person who was complaining about it was my mom. She wanted an ocean view room. She also always prefers newer hotels so she wouldn’t stop complaining about how old it was. I mean old windows, old AC, old washer and dryer . Z everything was old. But again spacious. We had maintenance workers come in few times while we were in the room to gain an access to our lanai where there was a hanging gondola thing was at - we didn’t mind it but it would definitely be a disturbance to some people... and it might concern some parents because it’s just hanging right above your head in the lanai. I didn’t let my toddler go to lanai.Tiny pool but our toddler loved it.It’s about 15 min walk to pretty much every popular spots like shopping centers and beaches. We were with seniors and a toddler so we Ubered a lot. The best thing about this hotel is that Fish Hook cafe downstairs. We got four vouchers for $40 off to use at the restaurant and their food was a bomb. I repeat - for the space and price we paid I think it was good but definitely an old hotel that needs serious upgrade. One of the hair dryers made a really loud sound I hesitated using it at night.

Positive aspects about our stay:--The room came with a kitchenette, which came quite in handy. It included a fridge that was larger than most hotel room mini-fridges I am used to seeing in high-end hotel rooms. It also came with cupboards stocked with some kitchen supplies, such as coffee cups, mugs, and some other dishes, and a sink. Note, the fridge had an upper shelf that seemed to be meant to function as a freezer, but it didn't really succeed at getting anything to frozen state. Also, we didn't find any silverware. --The room came with a safe, which worked as it should. It was somewhat hard to use at times, though. An error message would come up when it's supposed to open, occasionally. We found that it opens ok when we press hard on the door. Not really an issue.--There's one outdoor swimming pool area for the hotel. Clean, nice, with deck lounge chairs and a couple of covered areas. Not huge or fancy like the kind one might find at an all-inclusive resort, but good enough for a regular hotel. My youngest child insists that every lodging have a pool and will not be satisfied with any vacation that does not include enjoyment of the pool at some point. Fortunately, we managed to fit in a quick stop at the pool for her on the last day before checkout.--This hotel offers loaner beach chairs and beach umbrellas, available from the bell desk, free of charge. This came in handy. Love this feature! --Beach towels are available from front desk. There's no check-in/sign-in book, but instead you need to leave your beach towel card, which is provided upon check-in with the room key card, as collateral.--Valet parking, for a fee per day. This is pretty much par for the course to lodge in Waikiki or any large, dense city where public parking is a challenge. With In-and-out privileges, this arrangement is preferable to choosing alternate parking, at some commercial lot without in-out privileges, for example. Note, street parking is extremely difficult in Waikiki and probably not the way to go. It was nice to have parking available here. However, each time we needed to stop by the hotel for just a few minutes to grab something from the room, valet required us to leave the car key with him. This is not always the requirement at every hotel, in my experience, but I understand that not every hotel in every city has a valet receiving area of such a tight outdoor area that is situated close to the sidewalk of a well-traveled avenue. --within walking distance to the beach and quite a few shops and restaurants. 7 to 9 minute walk to Kahanamoku Beach at Hilton Village. About 15 - 20 mins walk to Waikiki (Royal Moana) Beach. About 5 mins to an ABC store. The main drag, at which this hotel is situated, has a lot of brand-name stores heading downtown. Quite a few shopping centers / malls in that direction as well. There a lot of Uber cars around.--The front desk, bell hop, house keeping, and valet personnel were all very nice. --After we checked out, we asked to leave our luggage with bell desk because we weren't ready to go to the airport yet and had more to do in Waikiki, for a few more hours or so. They were very accommodating about it and the gentleman on bell duty was pleasant and charming. (Not every hotel / lodging at comparable price point accommodates this). --During the day, there are dispensers of ice water in the lobby, one with lemon slices and one with orange slices. There is also a dispenser of ice water with orange slices near the First Floor elevator, at the pool towel cubby area before the swimming pool deck. Some other observations:--The layout of the hotel building was somewhat confusing. It took a while to figure out how the stairs worked. There's no direct staircase from the ""first"" floor, which is where we had our room, to the lobby floor. One has to take a flight of stairs to the mezzanine, and then go across the mezzanine to another staircase that is not clearly visible from the mezzanine elevator or the lobby because it's tucked around a bend (at left front corner when facing the street). I think the only other stairway leading from first floor to lobby level leads outdoors to the side of the building, but I didn't check. --There was a minor snafu about bathroom towels/supplies replenishment. They only left enough for three guests, somehow forgetting we had a fourth in our room. --We grudgingly called front desk to request one bath towel that was missing, as mentioned above. When a staff member came to drop it off, I thanked him with a smile and handed him a tip, and he thanked me before leaving. Before the door closed all the way, however, I caught a glimpse of some kind of expression on his face, from the side as he was walking away. I don't think he meant for me to see it, and it was probably not standard protocol for hotel staff. It gave me a strange feeling that I'm not accustomed to having during a hotel stay, even at a lower price point. It wasn't a big deal enough to complain to management or anything like that.Overall, but for a few minor hiccups, our stay went smoothly and comfortably. I would be open to coming back upon another visit to Waikiki.","Watchung, New Jersey","Michael L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Watchung, New Jersey</strong>",116,4.0

The only downside that became a nuisance was the lack of privacy & 2nd hand smoke from the divider on the balconies (new but poorly designed).

Short walk to the beach. ABC store across the hotel. Free beach towels just use your towel card. Free cold water at the lobby. Plus is the fish hook cafe which is located right down at the hotel.Booked thru costco travels. Got $100 dining credit plus $10 each person credit from Luana which totalled $150 which we used for Fish Hook Cafe.Stayed in a studio with kitchenette. Basic things needed are there. You may cook simple foods if you want to. Features are old though, faucet in the kitchen is leaking, bathroom handle wobbly, but otherwise everything else worked good. We had one bed and one pull out bed. Would have been better if we had 2 double beds but they said they only have pull out beds. Room was cleaned daily which is really great, new towels everyday, clean room everyday. Kudos to the housekeeping staff who work hard everyday. There is a shuttle going to Ala Moana mall fr the hotel too.Walking distance to the beach, international market, marukame udon, abc stores. We had the street view but still a good view bec we were at the 10th floor.They said you can see the Hilton fireworks fr the pool area but do not watch fr there bec you will only see half of the fireworks, not a good place to see the fireworks if you want to enjoy it.

The lobby and mezzanine have been recently renovated and they are starting on the floors with guest rooms now. There is a lovely wine and cheese reception on the mazzanine floor on certain evenings, free yoga classes, and free beach towels/chairs/boogie boards. The hotel is close to bus stops, is a short to moderate walk to shopping, restaurants and my favorite...the beach. They even have pet Betta fish that you can adopt for the day! The hotel gives you $10 vouchers to use at the Fish Hook Cafe on the 1st floor of the hotel, fantastic! There are comfortable cushioned rocking chairs and benches curbside for you to wait for your excursion shuttle pickup. All the hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. My only 2 complaints are 1) I was in a non-smoking room but the person in the room next door was smoking on their patio. This smoke was being drawn in through our room air conditioner at 2:30 a.m. I complained later that morning and was told that management would place a letter under the smoker's door. I don't know if they ever received it, because the next morning the guest was smoking in the patio again. When I mentioned this to the front desk, I was given an e-mail to correspond to. I submitted an e-mail including photos of the offending cigarette packs. Nobody ever responded to my e-mail or offered to move us to a different room. 2) Although we had a room refrigerator and coffee maker, it would have been nice to have a small, simple microwave.","Santa Clarita, California","Y5494OHheidik</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Clarita, California</strong>",2,3.0

Easy reservation and check in process. The staff here makes it one of the better experiences I've had in an extended-stay situation. I had a rental car shared between my coworkers, and they never gave us a hard time for leaving a key at the front desk in case one of us wasn't in the hotel and needed the car for later. We used the valet for the first two days and then switched to the Hale Koa parking for the long term rates. The workers at the front desk even recommended it, which shows that they care more about folks having a great experience than charging for their valet. They're never too busy to listen to concerns or make recommendations. Most of my interactions have been with the afternoon staff. Martha and Alexis have been particularly excited to hear about what adventures I have planned for the few days off I get. When my trip got extended, the thought of going to a condo crossed my mind, but this workforce has been so great and accomodating, it wasn't worth the risk to have more space, but less service. They really have made this hotel feel like a home away from home.The studio kitchenette had an ocean view facing Diamond Head. You can also see the main road the hotel is on. On the weekends you can get a great view of all the catamarans. It doesn't have a direct view of Friday night fireworks, but I could see them from the stairs on the ocean side of the hotel just fine. July 4th was great! Didn't have to leave the hotel and fight the tourists. I had a two-stove burger and a mini-fridge that made it easy to store leftovers and small frozen desserts (think pint-sized ice cream carton). I asked for a queen sized bed and sofa pull-out. The mattress is definitely on the firmer side of a box spring, but I'm usually exhausted by the end of the day. Some of my coworkers have found them uncomfortable . I remedied any discomfort by bringing my own body pillow and standard pillow. I don't expect everyone to want to do this on their vacation, but since I was staying long-term, it was the easiest for me to just drive to walmart and spend a few dollars. Never had a problem with housekeeping. Even if I didn't want my room cleaned, I could always count on my Auntie to ask if I'd like fresh towels, coffee or tea when she'd spot me in the hallway, even at the end of her shift. Any cleaniless issues were solved within 12 hours.I chose a hotel rate without amenities, but can comment on what my coworkers who were paying for amenities had too. Without amenities, you're still able to get free beach towels that you can return when you're done at the front desk. There's also dvd rental and a PS3 in the room (I didn't use these as I brought my own gaming system with streaming services). Ice machine was on the first floor. The laundry room is on the first floor (coin-operated, but I think it has a drop-off service that I haven't used), along with a gym and pool. As most of the shorter-staying folks are also roomed on that floor, it can get a little crowded, so it's best to try and do laundry when most families are out of the hotel. With the amenities fee, my coworkers received a $10/day coupon for the Fish Hook Cafe, with I opted not to. The hours are from 7a-2p, but I could really only go on Sundays due to my schedule. The hotel also has a shuttle that goes to the other hotels in Aqua Aston chain and to the mall, which is great for those trying to grab food or shop without a vehicle.As mentioned before, if you're bringing a car, the Hale Koa parking garage is the closest public parking to the hotel. You get a better rate if you're a government / DOD employee. Access to the beach is great and walkable in about five minutes or less. The lagoon behind the Hilton and the part of Waikiki Beach are very tourist-friendly. If you're into military history, there's a lot of statues at Fort DeRussey park and also an Army Museum nearby. Since I've been here, the hotel has been promoting that our room key can be used for free admission to the Bishop Museum and discounts at other local attractions. There's also an Expedia agent on site for those who don't want to hassle with the vendors on the street selling excursions. I booked round trip transportation with my one-day adventure tour at Kualoa, and the pickup point was within a 10-minute walk from this hotel. The Waikiki Trolley, The Bus, Biki bikes, and Hui car shares are close by. Uber and UberEats have been great transportation and food delivery options. The Ala Moana mall is about a 20-30 minute walk depending on your pace. The area is very pedestrian friendly. The greatest hazard are tourists with biki bikes riding on the sidewalks and trying to weave in and out of walkers.",,kryst252,2,5.0

It can do that by creating a culture where everyone in the staff believes in that mission. Three people I encountered made me question wether or not I mattered as a guest—that’s not a good experience. Getting out of a taxi on a rainy day, I was carrying a sleeping 18 month old, umbrella, bag and stroller. A young man sweeping was near and I asked him to please get the porter so they could send my bag and stroller to my room. He said go to the front desk and he kept sweeping. Then I got locked out of my room and with all 3 kids I approached  asked the house keeping lady for help, she said go to the front desk. And at the front desk, going to pick up the adopted beta fish, a young lady seemed to ignore me standing there in the small and quiet lobby for an awkward moment until I asked her if she was open. Finally, the young man taking out the garbage in my suite, sent me to ask the front desk because he didn’t know, when I asked if the Royal Hawaiian was on this same street. A simple smile, a simple may I help you, are inexpensive and 100% about corporate culture. I truly believe you can do better with your people—this is the easy part for most properties. And other small properties succeed in giving a 5 star quality service. The good stuff is the breakfast credit is good, the towel card is overkill for your tiny pool, the permanent puddle in front of your property is a plumbing issue -fix it. The TV in my suite was tiny in an old cabinet -fix it. The A/C needs some attention—clean the filter. My toilet had to be serviced twice because of a loud whistling noise (to your point each time we called maintenance was there in under 5 minutes). We reserved a double queen, you failed and gave me a cot. Get AC in hallway...it’s hot and humid—fix it. The bathroom needs an extractor—the bathroom odors lingering —fix it! And make sure the mattress fits the bed—very easy fix. Jessica, Tyler and James and (the other porter with ponytail) were helpful.

The convention center is a short 7-10 minute walk along with world class shopping at Ala Moana. Be sure to say hi to my cousin who manages #Local Motion on the third floor.

I read a recent review that states that the ""curtains didn't even cover the window"". I'm not sure what happened in their room but the curtains are wonderful and black out the entire window.

However, the Luana did a very nice job.Helps that we visited this location during off season. Prices were reasonable. The room is beautiful and very modern. Easy to tell this is probably a 1970's hotel but has recently been redone. Tile floors, flat screens, HUGE rooms. Nice pool.VERY nice staff. Always happy to help and be friendly.The hotel is NOT water front. But no fear. The beach is 2 blocks away.Breakfast is very limited for the $19 fee. Not worth it. A cost to watch for. Car parking. You have only one choice, valet. And this is $35 a night. Highly unreasonably expensive in my opinion. But this seems to be a trend in the area.Another cost, this seems to be a sort of tax. The Amenities Fee. It is $25 for this hotel. This covers the pool, towels, wifi, etc. For some reason it was waived during my stay.To conclude. Did I like my stay. Absolutely YES. Would I stay again at this hotel. Absolutely YES.","Santa Rosa, California","JTeruelJax</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Rosa, California</strong>",24,5.0

Stayed for 9 nights. Party of 4.Food: not much food options at this hotel. There is the morning Buffett (Fish Bowl) 7-11am and the Fish Hook Cafe 7am-2pm. Outside of these hours, you are on your own. The buffet food was average and got boring after 4-5 days. It was pretty much the same items everyday... selection of fruit, yogurt, cereals, granola, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fried rice, pastries and toast/bagels. Potatoes and pancakes rotated every 2nd day. Juice and coffee included. Coffee was good (a Kona blend). The price for Buffett was $18.95 adult and $12.95 for kids.Our Costco package includes a buffet for 2, certainly saved us money... we had a breakfast and coffee each morning and we often felt satisfied until early afternoon. So often we would have the Buffett, light lunch or snacks and then go to dinner (often a happy hour) in evening. So for breakfast (for 3) it cost us $3 plus a tip. We would use the $10 dining voucher/credit that is included in resort fee.One thing to know is the area for the Buffett is very small and can only accommodate 3 groups comfortably at a time. There are options to eat outside or bring the food to the Fishhook. Weboth... they will service you (for drinks, plates, etc) at all 3 locations. Service was great!Other than a sandwich we never really ate at the Fishhook, but the food looked good!You are close walking distance to cafes, ABC store and plenty of restaurants.Resort Fee: I think this is standard for hotels in the area and varies. It was not included in our package. With the $10 credit, it is like paying only $15 resort fee. We have stayed in 4 hotels in Oahu and this one actually provides a lot of things/services that you can actually use!We took advantage of using beach chairs, umbrellas and boogie boards when hitting the beach. We used their shuttle service to go to Ala Moana shopping mall. Rented a few movies and attended one of their managers receptions.Manager Reception: this free event is 5-6 on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. There’s live entertainment, wine, local craft beer and some cheeses, cracker, pretzels). We enjoyed the hour one evening had a couple drinks on our way out to dinner! Car Rental: we rented a car 4 times from the dollar location directly across the street. This was our third time to Waikiki, so we didn’t want a car the full time. In the past, we would rent for the full duration of trip and pay parking fees of $40/night. We saved quite a bit of money by pre booking the car from Dollar for individual days and returning by 8:00pm that evening. Gas station is adjacent to hotel too... so super easy!Location: you are a small 15min stroll to beach through a nice walking trail and park. You are pretty close to all the restaurants and happenings of Waikiki... just depends on where you are going. For example, in 15-20 minutes you can be at the Duke statue. We have stayed at Sheraton and Hilton Hawaiian Village so we were a little concerned about location off of beach... but it was fine as we knew it all in advance.Room: I’d get a high level room with a partial ocean view. Our room was average and had 2 queen beds and a nicer than expected view! Lots of cabinetry to store food and there is a kitchen sink and small fridge. We don’t cook much on vacations, so we picked this room instead of one with kitchen facility.Used the small gym a couple times, but not the pool. The pool and pool deck area are small and don’t get sun until later in afternoon.Plan on staying hear again!","Mount Pearl, Canada","birdadventures</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mount Pearl, Canada</strong>",3,4.0

Malia always had great information for us on our day's adventures.

The hotel is situation on the quieter end of Kalakaua Ave the main drag in Waikiki so it's slightly removed from the major hustle and bustle. We had a two room two bath suite with a huge lanai and washer/dryer on 7th floor. It was perfect for the 2 kids and allowed us to pack lighter. The lanai was so big that all seven of us ate pizza outside and enjoyed the Hawaiian breeze and view of stars. We also had a one bedroom one bath suite with and ocean view on the 9th floor over looking Kuroda Field. Both rooms were quiet with no noticeable street noise. What makes this an ideal location is that it borders Fort DeRussy so it's not surrounded by other large concrete high rises blocking out the view or the sun. The hotel provides free beach towels and beach chairs which we used almost everyday. We even rented a car and went to Bellows Beach on the windward side of the island and were able to take towels and chairs. Again the location is ideal and made for easy walking to every lunch and dinner meal and car rental office. Plus we walked to our outrigger ride and Fort DeRussy and Waikiki Beaches. Gas station next to hotel was our go to for a few things. Apples were available at the front desk each morning which made for a healthy snack for the kids. We have stayed at other hotels in Waikiki and this one was by far the most accommodating price, location and staff wise. We would rate it a 5 if the room furnishings were updated and the pool had more lounge chairs. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it.","Trophy Club, Tx","Kim F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Trophy Club, Tx</strong>",53,4.0

This is a great location as it is near the beach and restaurants. As someone who likes to work out that would be my only real complaint as the fitness room needs some serious updating. The front desk and concierge were extremely helpful from holding our luggage to calling us a mini van taxi cab to recommending restaurants.

My room was 1104.The staff were fantastic, friendly and efficient. The location is great as you are not in the middle of the shopping precinct, but only 5 minutes walk away.On three nights, the Luana provided Drinks, Nibbllies and local Entertainment which is a great thing for Guests.The Rooms are reasonably spacious and very comfortable. The Bathroom has a large vanity for storage of all the necessary items. The only thing I found was the balcony door was very hard to open and close.Some very minor issues that i encountered and if fixed would make it a 5/5 Hotel were;The property was replacing the Room Doors and the electronic locking system so initially I could not gain access to the Pool, Gym and Mezzanine toilets. Reception provided an additional card for access which solved this problem.The Buffet Breakfast is not worth the US$19++. The vouchers provided are better used in the Fish Hook Cafe. Great food and service, however not many tables and on occasion had to wait.Housekeeping was a bit sloppy initially with no bath mat or tea towel provided.Staff use the guest lifts and not the Service lift which can be annoying at peak times.The lifts also do not park spread out when not in use. For instance all lifts can be on the top floor and you have to wait for one to get down which may also stop on the way down. For instance, in off-peak times the lifts should park say one at the Lobby, one on the top floor and the third in the middle. This would then reduce the wait time.The Lift annunciators on each level only sound and light up when the lift doors open. It would be good for this to occur a couple of seconds before the lift arrival, so when struggling with luggage you can be prepared to move towards the arriving lift.All in all this is a great Hotel and would definitely stay there again.","Sydney, Australia","Travelheaps2209</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",79,4.0

You have to get there early if you want to get a seat. Our package included the breakfast buffet so we ate there but otherwise I would skip it. It was great to have a refrigerator in the room so we were able to buy milk for our daughter. I do wish the room had a microwave so we can microwave our leftovers.I wish they would have some sort of warning about the pool. It is an oddly shaped pool. The dangerous part was that where the stairs are, the pool splits into 2 parts: the right side of the stairs is the shallow end and the left side of the stairs goes from 4 feet to 6 feet in like one step. In normal pools, where the stairs are, that is the shallow end. As you walk further, the deeper end comes on. NOT in this pool!!. When I was there, I saw a Japanese lady carrying baby (less than a year old) into the pool. I was standing near the right side of the steps with my 3 year old daughter. She went to the left side of the pool with the baby. I watched her walk down and before I could say anything to her, she went down under the water. She was struggling to put the baby to the side of the pool. I shouted at my husband to get the baby from her because I couldn't leave my daughter. He swam over picked up the baby and swam with the baby to the stairs while mom swam back. It was a very scary situation. I can't imagine what would've happened if we weren't in the pool that day.","Los Angeles, California","swingonastar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",33,4.0

My ""highlights"" were......1. Very old decor everywhere2. Rooms had a strange musty smell like they hadn't been properly cleaned for ages3. The air-conditioners were unbelievably noisy. I'm a pretty deep sleeper though the old style air-cons kept waking me up4. The balcony was useless as there was no privacy. From our balcony I could easily see partly onto at least onto 6 other balconies, with one literally ~ 3 m away with no screening at all5. The beds were poor. For some bizarre reason the under-sheets were too small for the beds and so kept riding high during the night. As for house-keeping, one day I found they had simply pulled up the top sheets, as the under-sheet was still pulled up high from the night before...lazy housekeeping effort there6. The ""buffet breakfast"" was a joke- easily the worst I have seen in 30 years of travelling. The ""restaurant"" was a tiny room with enough space for only 4 tables- for the whole hotel!. There was an extraordinarily small range of food offered and it was of very average quality. 7. The front desk staff seemed to not care about their customers. One was blatantly rude to us. On other days I saw two separate parties arguing with front-desk staff over some issue. One staff member did smile at us several times, though the others seemed happy to just stand around and ignore guests.8. The Hotel location is at the wrong end of Waikiki and right next to a very noisy petrol station. Street noise was very noticeable.9. The pool is tiny 10. Ridiculously expensive daily resort fee for the all the ""services"" offered (yes I know what they are- they're just really poor all-around). To call itself a ""resort"" is a joke. So if it was a youth hostel or was advertised as a 2 star hotel, then The Luana would be acceptable. However I found it to be extraordinarily over-priced for the very poor quality and services offered.

Would not stay here again. We arrived at 8.30am and were told there were rooms we could check into immediately, but not the type we needed (two twins - we had two teenage children with us and they could not provide interconnecting rooms, so we had to have one parent stay with each child ie two twin rooms). Alternatively if we waited to check in til 3pm, we would have the two twins, so we chose to do that. Walked around Waikiki for 7 hrs, with no opportunity to swim or change clothes (as we couldn't unpack) and then arrived back to be given two double rooms ie a queen bed in each, not even adjacent rooms. When we went to raise this with the staff, they had the attitude that ""there's nothing we can do about it"" and shrugged their shoulders. We asked for the Manager, and she was the same, and even got quite narky in the way she was speaking to us. We then were told we could speak to the General Manager, Clem, and while he was more empathetic, he would not believe our telling of the situation and took no responsibility for the clear error someone on his staff had made. We were then put into adjacent rooms with a queen bed and a pull-out sofa in each - better, but still not ideal as the sofa bed in both rooms had a dip in the middle and both my husband and my son had a sore back the next day from sleeping on these. We re finally moved to suitable rooms on Day two of our visit - only then could we actually unpack and access things to go to the beach etc, so properly start our holiday. The breakfast buffet room has barely enough seating for 10-12 people, and was a very minimal menu, so even if you could get a seat (which was difficult - we waited for 20 mins two days in a row, then decided to breakfast elsewhere in future), the food was poor. The resort fee is supposed to account for this - you get vouchers back to use for breakfast - but what is the point if you can't use them? A resort fee should be to pay for things the resort provides on top of the standard inclusions a hotel would normally give: I don't call towels or chairs for the beach ""resort extra's"" when you are staying at a beach hotel! So on check out we paid around US$600 resort fee for our 8 day stay for essentially nothing.","Mt Eliza, Australia","Suzanne S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mt Eliza, Australia</strong>",3,2.0

I was disappointed at first. Our flight got here at 8:30. Great welcome from rep at airport with flower lei and good ride to Hotel. Had called earlier and was told would honour waiving of resort fee for govt workers. At desk was told no because booked through Costco. Was given breakfast vouchers - no assistance with the bags at all and no additional information or recommendations from John. The room was small and just average. I thought with the comment from John I must have gotten an awesome deal with Costco. Apparently not. Nothing in the fridge. No microwave. Coffee burnt on the coffee maker. And tiny bathroom. Started off on the wrong foot but I have to say the rest of the staff are good. Breakfast was decent and it was convenient to have this available on site. Its not open all day so no lunch or dinner options on site. Open for Dinner only on Friday and Saturday. The parking fee is $35 per night. If Hawaii's primary industry is hospitality, this place falls short. We weren't even told the extra vouchers could be used to to get water for the fridge which would have been nice. I am disappointed with Costco and the Luana. They need to make better arrangements for late arrivers and some kind of info or orientation time regarding the amenities. Maybe I have just gotten used to A class service from Costco so expected similar from Costco travel and the Luana if they have partnered.

It has everything one can hope for. Classic Hawaiian style lobby and mezzanine. Rates are very competitive (probably some of the best you'll find in Waikiki). Location is very nice, right next to Fort Derussy and its beautiful beach (much wider than the central Waikiki beach). It's right at the edge of the Kalakaua strip, so not as busy as the other hotels right in the middle of it. Check-in was professionally handled by Chastity, who, at our request, arranged for a room with a better view for a nominal daily fee. We ended with a ""partial ocean view"" room on the 16th floor (the highest one). In reality, we had a very good view of the ocean along with a wonderful view of Waikiki and the Diamond head. Rooms are spacious and clean, with a balcony. Our room had a granite counter with a large sink and small fridge, but no microwave or hot plate (which are found only if you book a studio kitchenette). Granite counter also in the bathroom. Mattresses were firm and particularly comfortable. There is a safe in each room. AC worked well. The pool was only slightly heated and we found lots of hair in it (filtering issue?). Of note, there are two large, very nice natural gas Weber BBQs available; we used them on two occasions when we didn't feel like going out to restaurant. Laundry facilities were modern and functioning properly. Three times a week, there is a ""manager's reception"" on the mezzanine, where they offer wine, local beer, cheese and crackers at no cost. We found the wines to be actually quite decent. Bikes are also available for free (see the bell boy). Buses pass at the front door should you wish to go to places like the Diamond Head or Hanauma Bay (where parking is tricky). Staff were friendly and helpful at all times. All in all, I'm not sure what else someone could ask for. Having said this, I am knocking off one star in my overall rating because of the so-called ""amenity fees"" of $25 charged on daily basis. This is basically a surcharge for such things as pool towels and beach chairs which should be part of the basic accommodation charges. Nothing we saw justified that surcharge. Most Waikiki hotels charge it but that doesn't make it acceptable. It really comes across as a scam, a gimmick, a money-grab.

Apartment nice and functional, you don't get a ""Wow"" moment when you open the door, but kitchen was functional (no oven, but electric hob and microwave, along with toaster, kettle etc). Probably could do with some decorative updates/modernisation, but I would recommend and I would stay here again. Whilst some of the other bigger hotels in Waikiki look appealing from the outside, they are much larger, busier and more expensive, so the Luana I believe provides good value for money.

The front entrance can get a bit busy especially if multiple guests arrive at the same time. The valet was friendly and assisted my group, although several of us were not using the valet but only dropping off luggage. I opted to use the Hale Koa parking lot behind Luana, as I am DoD and can get a pretty good rate. The parking lot is about a two minute walk around the hotel, nothing that isn’t manageable.Once my team started checking-in, Melanie (believe she was the manager on duty) questioned our group rate and was actually able to get us a better rate for our extended stay. I am so thankful she was there, paying attention and went the extra mile to get us a better rate. She definitely could have let us check-in and pay the higher rate, but she knew we qualified for the lower rate and made a phone call and got it authorized. That’s what I call customer service. The rest of the check-in was great and AlJohn was extremely friendly and helpful. The room was clean as was the rest of hotel. After the day we had at the last hotel (personal items covered in mold) this was a refreshing arrival. Room is quite roomy with a kitchenette. I am here for over 30 days on busy and the ability to make some in-rooms meals was needed. The bathroom is a bit on the smaller side, but it will work and I personally would rather have the kitchenette than a large bathroom, but that’s my personal preference. Also, I wasn’t paying attention when I checked-in and noticed when I got to my room that it was two queen beds vice a queen and a sofa. I called the front desk and they said they would move me with no problem but would call me back after she looked up the rooms. She did call back but they did not have any rooms available until 2 days later. Although she said originally that they would move me, she immediately called me back and gave me a thorough explanation and was extremely courteous and friendly. I was very pleased to know that she tried multiple times to accommodate my request and although I have to wait a couple days, I am able to change to the room wanted.So far, Day 1, this hotel gets a 5-Star rating for service, cleanliness, accommodations, and location.

Hotel staff for the most part were very friendly and helpful, unfortunately with the exception of a few. I am a smoker, this was a smoke free property, which I do not have a problem with. I would walk off the property for my cigarette. Our 4th day into our 7 day vacation, I had a guest staying at the hotel inform me that they did have a more private smoking area at the back of the resort. That would have been nice to know so I didn't feel like a bum standing out on the street.The pool at the resort is very small, and the sun does not reach it until late in the afternoon, which leaves the water quite cool and very cool once you get out. The bar, a bit of a joke, as it is only open Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and only between 5pm and 6pm. Not really anyones idea of a bar.The restaurant, again kind of a joke. Breakfast buffet every morning from 7am to 11am. Very small buffet, had scrambled eggs, bacon, potato or rice and sausage. It did have a bit of fruit and some yogurt which is fine, but at $18.99 per person, so not worth it. That being said, the restaurant is only open daily from 7am until 2pm, so if you want an evening meal you need to once again leave the property. We checked out of the resort on March 10th, check out was at 12pm, our shuttle did not pick us up until 8pm. We had spoken to a girl at the front desk the day prior, she explained that we would get a key for the pool, washrooms and would be able to use all amenities that were with our original booking. However, the girl that checked us out did not offer us that and I had to go back and ask for it. Minor yes, but not consistent service. We did have an amazing vacation, and Hawaii is beautiful.

Since this was a family vacation with 5 individuals (including grandpa and 2 older grandkids), we said the suite would not work and was unacceptable. The first option given of 2 separate rooms on different floors was also unacceptable. We asked to speak to a manager and Guest Services Supervisor Kanani Merseburgh listened to our issue. Rather than dismissing it, she was not only sympathetic but said she would work with us to find another solution. Since there wasn't another available suite large enough to accommodate us, she asked Melissa on her staff to find another option. With Melissa's tireless assistance (she worked with us for at least 30 minutes while suggesting alternatives), she was eventually able to find 2 individual rooms across from each other on the same floor (1 with a kitchen). We took this option and while not perfect for grandpa, it did end up working for us (give Melissa a raise).Kanani also assured us this type of mixup would not happen when we returned to the Luana 3 weeks later and she lived up to her word.

We had a partial ocean view kitchenette and couldn’t have been happier. The room looks over the park to the ocean and is beautiful. Overall this is a great little hotel and the Fish Hook restaurant on property is fabulous but only open for breakfast and lunch 7-2. Increble food and staff there too. A 10 on the hotel and the food.

Black out curtains were great but my only negative would be the light coming in at night around the door frame from the hallway lights. This lit up the room like a lighthouse beacon! Sofa cushions across the door helped to alleviate this.Luana is a 10 min walk (past some great shopping) to Waikiki Beach and a 20 min walk to Ala Moana Mall (or an 8 min bike ride). There are plenty of good food options within a 2-8 min walk. The gas station right next door offers convertible rental car options as well as the best fried chicken in HNL apparently (tried and tested by one of our group)!

At this price at peak season, I thought it was excellent value for money.I was initially disappointed at check-in to discover that we were on the 1st floor as I was hoping for a room with a view. On getting to the room though I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the rooms on that floor had huge balconies (16sqm+) - enough space for a couple of deck loungers, table and chairs etc. There was a significant amount of road noise, but this was largely drowned out by the air conditioner.The room was dated, but clean and comfortable. The kitchenette had plates, cutlery, a toaster, coffee machine. The $10 per day vouchers were an awesome bonus, allowing us to eat breakfast on site twice. We happily paid on another day to eat here too as discovered it good value for money ($14.95 for adults, $8.95 kids) Breakfast consisted of:fresh fruit (blueberries/strawberries/pineapple), yoghurt, granola. 4 hot dishes (fried rice, pancakes, bacon/sausages, eggs) and bagels/bread/muffins & spreads. There was also plentiful tea, decent coffee and juice. The male staff here were exceptionally efficient, friendly and happy despite being rushed off their feet. The wine and cheese nights were fun. Decent beer, wine, pretzels, cheese, crackers, nuts and grapes on offer and replenished frequently. Live entertainment was provided. Was really relaxing. The pool area was immaculately clean, although the bulk on the pool area is in the shade until afternoon. The gym was clean and well-equipped. There is a DVD machine in the lobby to rent DVDs for the in-room play-station. One per day is covered in the resort fee. Location-wise it was excellent. Plenty of places to eat nearby (Subway 5mins walk) ABC Store & coffee/bagel cafe across street + more.

I think that means you will pay too much. The lobby is beautiful and modern looking. The young lady who checked us in was unfriendly and did not acknowledge my presence until I asked her if I should see someone else to check in. For a daily $20 fee, she gave me a list of amenities. I thought amenities were included?? Maybe not. Overall, the hotel is very clean.Upstairs, the carpet is from the early 1980's as was the room decor. The kitchenette had nice dishes and silverware. Kitchenettes are most useful with pots and pans to cook in. We had a small skillet and a 5 quart Dutch oven as cookware. No additional cookware was available. First time I ever cooked a can of green beans in a small skillet. I guess yp u learn to improvise.The pool area is small, but nice. The barbecue grills came in handy, but you have to use the Dutch oven to bring your meat down and back up and then to cook anything to go with the meat. T.V. is clear across the room (also outdated) above the air conditioner. We had to raise the volume to hear it over the air conditioner. $35 per day for valet parking was a surprise, too. No self parking. So on top of the daily room rate, add $55 for resort fee and valet parking PER DAY! We did take advantage of the ""free"" bicycles since parking in that area as you visit the beach and/or the zoo is quite hard to find.Our trip was great, but the hotel room was disappointing considering how much it costs.","Zachary, Louisiana","Robs6010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Zachary, Louisiana</strong>",9,2.0

I stayed there 15 nights with my friend and staff were pleasant. The doormen especially, always friendly and wanting a chat or making us laugh with their jokes. 5 star service. However If you want to go to the beach this hotel is not recommended since it's 15 minutes away on foot. The hotel is a little on the tired side...very 1980's decor so was a bit depressing....Upon checkin I gave my Japanese credit card which was charged and we went about enjoying our Hawaii trip which we had planned for 7 years. Upon checkout I was the Only one left, as my friend had left on a different flight. I went to checkout and pay the car parking and was told my card hadn't charged and I needed to pay around $2600. As I'd been in Hawaii 16 days, neither of my cards would charge and I was lectured by staff about how I should have had money on the card (I had for the car parking, and had paid the room stay upon checkin so WTF?) I was at the counter for almost an hour. Staff charged my card another $1500. I was actually confused as to why there was apparently no money on the card since there is a $7000 limit and I'd hardly used the card.... I continually told staff I was running late for my flight but they said I couldn't leave without paying. In the meantime other guests were coming and going and listening to the staff lecture me which was quite humiliating.,. I couldn't believe I was in that position..... Finally after speaking and explaining the situation with the manager I was allowed to leave and rushed to the airport. I made the checkin within two minutes of the counter closing! Upon returning to Japan I got my card statement and to my shock, I'd been charged not only the $2600 for the room stay but also the $1500! So I was overcharged $1500! I immediately called the hotel but they claim to have not received the money.  I then called booking.com where I booked and told them what happened. They sent me an email saying I'd run away from the hotel without paying! WTF!! After sending emails to at least 4 different people at booking.com, plus speaking with several useless staff at Luana the money was still not returned.  I contacted my credit card company who are now looking into this issue. It's been 3 months since I checked out, Luana are still sending me emails claiming I owe them (they claim to have received the $1500 but not the$2600, despite me sending photocopies of my bank statement)  I even received an email from booking.com a couple of days ago saying not to worry about paying the balance of the hotel charge...WTF? I'm owed $1500! All the meantime this money is accruing interest and Luana or booking.com couldn't give a damn!  I travel 5 times a year overseas and this is honestly the worst experience I've ever had,,.,it's not something I'd expect in a place like Hawaii... The management of this hotel should be fired....I'm looking into getting the hotel owners name and sending them this message too. This problem should not happen in a big hotel like this. If you're planning on staying there, DO NOT use your credit card....you could end up like me over 3 months later and not getting your overcharged money back...","Osaka, Japan","Samantha A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Osaka, Japan</strong>",17,1.0

It's close to the beach, Waikiki and Downtown. If you can get an ocean view room do, because it's situated next to a park, so the view is worth it. When you check in you are given a voucher to use either for the breakfast buffet or for lunch-though it doesn't pay for the whole meal, so bring cash or card.. It's also per room-not per person. We didn't do the lunch, but the breakfast buffet was good. There are several breakfast places near by that are cheaper and just as good. I liked the fact that we were given a free towel to take to the beach along with a beach chair-nice perk! The staff was very accommodating. it's valet parking-which you pay per day. The valet staff was super friendly and very knowledgable about the island. The room was basic but clean, but as I said the view is what made it.

That being said, the hotel was amazing. This was mostly due to the people who work there. Their hard work to keep the hotel clean and welcoming was top notch. I usually travel on a budget, but they made me feel like I paid a fortune for the attention they gave me... Always acknowledging me as I come and go, and quick to help if I needed anything at all. The pool was a nice option to relax if you didn't want to walk the 5 mins to the beach. The buffet and Fish Hook cafe are both amazing and the staff there are just as amazing as the others.The only downside of this hotel experience is the AC unit. It seems confused. Lol. It will turn on and off multiple times without actual cooling anything, and a rush of water. We spent most of the time sleeping with the patio door open, which was nice, but could be noisy at night.Overall it was a great experience, and if I ever go back to Waikiki I'll definitely stay here again.

We arrived at 7am in the morning and had previously requested an early check in. They said they would try but could not guarantee it. When we did arrive they said the room is all ready which was much appreciated after a long flight and we had a good rest before heading out.We had a one bedroom apartment which was not huge but was big enough. Upon arrival everything was pretty clean and tidy. There were a few little things we needed to call guest services about and each time they dealt with things promptly and were accommodating.Like others have said the air con units are a bit noisy. The balcony is small but big enough to take in the view which is great looking at the park and beach beyond. Do take note that if you have small children like us you need to be extremely careful with them on the balcony as the bars on the railing are wide enough for kids to fall through.The hotel is in a handy location - easy stroll to the main part of Waikiki and short walk through the park to the beach. This beach is more family orientated and it is nice to have a park adjacent to the beach. If you want it busier with more action I would head to that part of the beach near the main shopping part of Waikiki.The shuttle to Ala Moana is good although big tip - the shuttle does a loop and the hotel is at the start so you will be on a 45 minute trip before getting to Ala Moana. This may be ok to do once to take in the scenery. However you can bypass the big loop by walking over the street to the Holiday Inn as the shuttle loops around to that hotel and from there it is only 10 minutes or so to Ala Moana.Pool was clean and big enough.

Our 5th floor room was excellent, comfortable twin double beds, lots of storage space, air conditioned (perhaps a tad noisy) and a great bathroom. Staff were very friendly and efficient. Breakfast was not included but the hotel provides $10 vouchers daily against the cost of the buffet breakfast at the small Fish Bowl in the lobby or a limited ala cart breakfast at the Fish Hook near the hotel entrance. Other food options are close by and there are two convenience stores just across the road. The hotel has a nice pool area, and other amenities such as ice dispenser, vending machine and self-serve laundry service. The hotel charges an $18 a day resort fee, the value of which I'm unsure! The room has a non-stocked bar fridge and coffee and tea making facilities but only supplies a percolator. An electric jug or kettle would have served us better!

They seem to be an older hotel trying to modernize itself. ROOMS are comfortable BUT lacks in good air conditioning. There's a rather loud AC unit under the window, no AC in the hallways, elevators or fitness room. FITNESS ROOM is well equipped but has 3 walls of all windows without AC, a fan or shading. It's like workout out in a sauna. ELEVATORS are being worked on and are REALLY SLOW in transporting people up and down 16 floors. DINING includes one small restaurant (4 tables) for a buffet breakfast and 1 small cafe (1 table + window bar seating) for breakfast and lunch. Reasonable cost wise. They provide a $10 per person voucher for the restaurants.A FREE SHUTTLE is provided which makes a full circle along Waikiki to their sister hotels between Diamond Head to Ala Moana shopping center. They also provide on a first come first serve basis beach chairs, boogie boards and umbrellas at no cost (nice). THE BEACH is 1038 steps from the hotel (we counted them). It's a small but not over crowded beach.We rented a room with a KITCHENETTE and was able to walk to the Food Pantry that's only 10 minutes away for our food. The kitchen was adequately stocked although the knives were not very sharp. In addition, there's a barbecue available by the TINY POOL area. The CUSTOMER SERVICE was excellent. They were always very responsive to anything we asked for. The front desk and valet parking offered great tips. They charge a daily resort fee and valet parking fee but that's par for Waikiki. There's always dispensers of fruit infused water in the lobby that was very refreshing.For the price I think it's a pretty value in the Waikiki area and would consider staying here again, especially if they offer more and better AC.","Burlingame, California","Lily Q</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Burlingame, California</strong>",37,4.0

Several of the original staff remembered us from our previous visits which was really good considering the number of people they must see. Arrived early morning so not able to check in straight away (check in is at 3pm which we knew), so stored our luggage and went for breakfast. Returned later and completed check in with no issues, new staff friendly and helpful. They still offer free tea, coffee and water in the lobby which is a great touch. The cheese and wine which is offered three times a week is a great way to meet other guests. The location of the hotel is ideal - turn right and luxury row, turn left and head to Ala Moana shopping center. Lots of bars / restaurants nearby and as it is at the start of Kalakaua Ave it is quieter in my opinion. Others have complained about noise, I would imagine it would be worse down in the middle of Kalakaua....we don't even notice the road noise.The elevators are still being upgraded and there was a slight delay sometimes, but nothing like the waits others have complained about....it really isn't a big issue.Mahalo to bell boys, Ryan and Jayce, and concierge Tyler - your friendliness and help was greatly appreciated. To the ladies on the front desk - keep up the good workI am sure there are better hotels in Waikiki but we will never find out as we will always stay at Luana due to the staff, I hope management appreciate how lucky they are to have these people.Some complain about the resort fee which is added to the room rate - this appears to be standard at nearly every hotel now and in a lot of instances it is a lot higher. Personally I would prefer it was just added onto the room rates rather than being a separate item, but hey it's the norm.We took Tim Tams from Australia which seemed to go down well with the staff (will bring more next time).Thank-you once again Luana for a wonderful 16 night stay.

The kitchenette had everything we needed to make simple meals in our room. -The service was very, very good. Everyone from the front desk to the maintenance folks were always extremely nice and helpful (we haven't yet taken advantage of the concierge, but other guests seemed pleased). -The services offered (included in the resort fee) were a nice addition: manager's reception with free beer/wine/cheese three times a week; morning yoga four times a week; folding bikes; new movie/DVDs; beach chairs and umbrellas; gym; pool; BBQ area; laundry. -The hotel is a very short, easy walk to the beach and Waikiki restaurants.

The room was still nice, but could use some serious updates.-The restaurant was closed, although they did offer free coffee every morning in the lobby. -As others have mentioned, the elevators are being updated. Two are complete, and the third should be complete soon. There is some noise associated with the updates to the elevator, but will be resolved when the construction is complete. -A/C is a window unit that can be a bit loud. *Update: we moved rooms toward the end of our stay and the A/C was much nicer in the second room. Depends on the room. -The biggest issue that we've had is with our vehicle. We parked with the valet for our entire stay and by the third week we had a roach problem in our car. We bought roach bait, but each time we took the car our we saw additional bugs. I have brought this up with management, and hope that they will address this issue. **for clarification: we have seen no bugs inside the hotel; our car has been parked in the parking garage. Overall the pros outweigh the few cons. It seems like the Luana is being updated slowly. It is in a great location, and with the additional services, is a great place to stay for the price. It is an excellent hotel for military on TLA. I would recommend purely based on the service, the location, and the view!","Honolulu, Hawaii","Jax H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",0,4.0

Our partial ocean view room was on the 14th floor and had a lovely view overlooking Fort DeRussy Beach Park, the ocean and a city view of Waikiki. We had a kitchenette, which was very convenient as there is no restaurant in the hotel. There is a grocery store nearby and an ABC store across the street, as well as many restaurants close by. It is a short walk to the beach and the hotel provided beach chairs, mats and towels. We did have a couple of rainy days and they seemed to have plenty umbrellas on hand. There is infused water in the lobby and near the pool /fitness centre and daily newspapers available. We also made use of the shuttle service, which went through Waikiki and to Ala Moana Mall. One of our favourite things was the wine and cheese nights. It was a great way to meet other guests and we appreciated the free wine, beer, snacks and entertainment. We also barbequed our dinner one night on the outdoor grill on the sundeck. It was fun and again a great way to meet some of the other guests. The pool is small, but had comfortable loungers and it wasn't overly crowded. They also offer yoga classes, free DVD's and have bicycles available, but we didn't make use of these. We knew about the elevators from reading previous reviews so we were prepared for that and most people made light of it. One of the quirky things in our room is that it only had sheers and not a full drape. It wasn't a problem for us, but it could be if you need total darkness to sleep. I only have one minor complaint and that is that I didn't think the housekeeping was as thorough as it could have been The bed was always made, but on some days the floor wasn't swept and not all the surfaces were wiped down. It was especially noticeable because we were cooking and eating some meals in our room. We did the best we could, but there was no broom or cleaning supplies provided. Since we booked through the hotel, and not as a vacation rental, we expected a bit more. The cleanliness of the common areas was very good. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We stayed for fourteen nights and enjoyed it very much! It's not a luxury hotel, but it was comfortable and friendly.","British Columbia, Canada","segonthego</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>British Columbia, Canada</strong>",9,4.0

We had a clear view of the ocean and could see the waves, sailboats and surfers as we sipped mai tais on our balcony. It had a bedroom, living room, and full kitchen, yet was paid 1500 less than actually staying at one of the other hotels on the beach. That is great value and you pay half the resort fee because you are not on the beach. The full kitchen allows you to make meals and save on restaurant costs. We saw numerous families with young children. The only minor inconvenience was that one of the elevators was recently installed and required an inspection before it was put in service. The staff are super friendly (although everyone one is in Hawaii) and helped us many times. It has a great location, close to the beach. You just need to walk across the road to access any of the tours or trolleys available. This is important because there are so many one way streets that you have to walk a ways to get on a public vehicle from some hotels. They have a regular wine an cheese that was great.

The location was excellent, make no mistake about it. The Waikiki beach is within walking distance and when we were in town so was the Spam Jam! The view from our room was also beautiful and we did not find it to be noisy, as other reviewers have mentioned, even though we were on the 7th floor. Additionally, they offered some amenities like umbrellas you could borrow, which was a plus in our book especially since it was a bit rainy during our stay. However, that's about where the positives end. As someone else mentioned, there are only 2 functioning elevators as the 3rd is undergoing renovations...and boy are they slow! If you ever had to make it up to your room you should easily plan for 10-20 minutes waiting for the elevator depending on the time of day. Also, with my husband being in a wheelchair taking the stairs was never an option. The bed and pillows in the room were AWFUL - so much so, in fact, that after getting no sleep the first night I ended up making a cot out of blankets we brought for the flights and slept on that instead. I also used a travel pillow instead of theirs and finally got a better night's sleep. Finally, and what bothered us the most, is that the Luana Waikiki offered us a wheelchair accessible room which was NOT accessible at all. Sure, my husband could get in and onto the bed/balcony but the most important part, which is the restroom was a true nightmare and, frankly, quite dangerous. It took multiple transfers for my husband to get from his chair to the toilet and then to his shower chair and he needed assistance every step of the way. You might think that's normal if you've never been around someone with paralysis but let me assure you: it isn't. My husband is a young, independent wheelchair athlete so this was anything but the norm. Overall, while the view and location were excellent the amenities did not warrant the nightly fees and the uncomfortable bed and inaccessible bathroom all but sealed the deal. We will not be back nor can we, in good conscience, recommend this place to anyone else.","Columbus, Ohio","Valerie P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>",18,2.0

When making the booking in 2016 I was aware of the elevator upgrade and thought it would be near completation for my stay in April 2017 but unfortunately that was not the case and the wait time for lifts was ridiculous and it would stop on almost every floor making it a long journey. Another issue we had on our visit was the noise - we had spent two weeks in Waikiki and the other islands and this was our last hotel stay where we was hoping for a good night sleep as we had to catch an early international flight, but we had a very restless night with street noise, sirens, car radios and all this was heard from the 9th floor room was not very sound proof.

We stayed at 2 different hotels in Waikiki, before and after a stay on the Big Island. At the first one we got a one-bedroom suite for less than the cost of the studio at Luana. I guess the difference is that the Luana was located at the posher upper end of Waikiki, where there is an up-scale shopping district. On the positive side, we did find it fun to browse through the shops and shopping centers. The beach at that upper part of Waikiki is also nicer. My son enjoyed taking out the complementary DVDs and video games. Be warned if taking the free shuttle to Ala Moana because it heads first in completely the wrong direction, making a long circuit to pick up other passenger from other hotels before it backtracks back up towards Ala Moana.

I did this when I traveled to Florida several years ago, and the property was beautiful. I expected the same here, but my expectations were not met. After staying here, I can honestly say that I am disappointed that Costco even offered this hotel as an option for several reasons. First, all that noise, noise, noise (Yes, I sound like the Grinch!) Seriously, it was like sleeping under a freeway overpass. I had asked for a quiet room, but my room was very close to a five lane intersection with a busy gas station right below my window. I heard sirens, honking, and trucks backing up (beep, beep, beep). There was even a wreck right below my window. (It looked like a moped hit a telephone pole.) All this was very audible from the 12th floor. I simply couldn't tolerate it, and I complained to the front desk. They said that they would move me to the other side the next day. Well, that room (1014) was indeed better, but still very loud, since the other side faces a three lane busy road. I still heard sirens, car alarms, traffic, etc. On top of that, the rooms are not well sound-proofed, so I heard talking, coughing, scratching noises, water running, etc, so I had to wear ear plugs every night. Second, the elevator situation is an abomination. Seriously, sometimes, it would take 10 minutes or more just for the elevator to come. Then, it would stop on almost every floor, and about half the floors didn't even have people entering. Now, this would have been tolerable for me if the stair situation was acceptable, but there was no easy way to go from my hotel room to the lobby or mezzanine using the stairs. The third thing I didn't like was the fact it was not at all a resort. This hotel charges an additional $18.00 a day called a resort fee. I had to pay this separate from the Costco booking, and it made me think that the property was resort-like since I have only encountered such fees at nicer properties. Well, this place is no resort. There is no spa, no hot tub, no onsite restaurant that was open - not even anywhere to buy food. The only way you could get a snack is by crossing 5 lanes of traffic. Fourth, the overall room situation was less than idea. The bedding was extremely uncomfortable. The mattress looked like it was about 20 years ago, and the pillows were like cardboard. On top of that, on my paperwork, it said I was getting 2 beds, but we didn't. We got one queen bed and one hide-a-bed. When I complained about this along with the fact that I also asked for a quiet room - both of which were noted in the paperwork - I was told that there was no guarantee that ""special"" requests such as two actual beds could be accommodated. Furthermore, the housekeeping staff wasn't great. My coffeemaker wasn't washed for days, and no one even took the time to wash the couple cups in the sink, even after I complained to the front desk. Now, there are two reasons that I am not giving this property one star. One highlight was the concierge, Tyler. He was excellent, He was friendly, knowledgeable, and patient, and he worked with us to book some fun adventures during our time there. Second, the front desk claimed that they gave me a 'free' upgrade when they moved my room to the ocean-side, which I did appreciate. While the partial ocean view is somewhat of a joke since as I noted, this room is much closer to a three lane road than the ocean, it was less noisy than the first room I had. However, I wish the hotel would have noted, when booking, the side you choose makes a difference in terms of the noise. I didn't know that. I don't spend much time in hotel rooms when on vacation, and didn't initially book the upgrade because I thought it was just a matter of the view. Lastly, if you do stay here, be prepared for some inconveniences and if you don't want extreme noise, book a room with a partial ocean view. Better yet, spent a little more and stay at the hotel right behind this one called Hale Koa, which is absolutely beautiful. To be honest, I would have left this hotel the first night if it had just been me, but we had other family members staying at the hotel as well, so I tried to make the best of it.","Phoenix, Arizona","DrBrightside2010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",13,2.0

We had spent 10 days in Maui, and wanted to visit Pearl Harbor and spend a couple of days in Oahu. We didn't know anything about Waikiki, and booked the Luana based upon the Costco recommendation. Aside from being overwhelmed about how crowded Waikiki is, this hotel was very nice. We did not utilize all of the amenities, although the pool looked really inviting with nice chairs and a spacious deck area. The hotel will provide towels and beach chairs, but we were not in Waikiki long enough to spend a day at the beach. The hotel also offers a yoga class one morning and a wine and cheese hour one evening. We didn't do either, but there were several people that did. The hotel is walking distance to several shops and restaurants, and we took advantage of that. They charge $35/night for valet parking (you really have no choice) and the valet guys were very friendly and helpful. The hotel also charges an $18/night hospitality fee. I suppose if you use all of the amenities, it is worth it. We had an ocean view suite, and it was well equipped with comfy beds and plenty of space. The concierge was very helpful giving us ideas of where to stop along the North Shore and had good suggestions for eating out. The gals at the front desk were also very nice and helpful.

Unfortunately beyond that you shouldn't expect too much- the staff are friendly and helpful but much of the time can't answer your questions as there are several different teams of people operating in the hotel. There is no food available and you have to take a short walk anytime you want anything to eat or drink. The elevators as you will read in many reviews are ridiculous and cause many headaches. The room configuration we asked for we didn't exactly get and we were simply told that it's not a guarantee that you get particular configurations when you book- just a possibility.

There is also a DVD/ps3 game rental machine in the lobby. Didn't really get a chance to use it, but I think those are complimentary too. We had an awesome ""3d TV"" from our balcony! The pool area has a large, open deck for tanning, BBQ grills, and large gazebos to relax under while listening to Hawaiian music playing in the background. One of the elevators had been fully renovated, (the front desk person was really excited about it) it was fast and a very smooth ride. Definitely a good addition!

The hotel is clean, the staff friendly and helpful and the little added extras (free bike hire, video hire and yoga) are a really nice bonus - what you would expect from a four star stay - however that's about where it ends for the rating. Now don't get me wrong, the rooms are clean; reasonably well maintained and the WIFI is adequate but the hotel it self is very dated - very. There is no restaurant nor room service (apart from other venues delivering) and no bar for a quiet get togeather. But probably my biggesy complaint would be the work being done on the elevators; only two work (one of those stops only at random floors I think it decides on impulse); of those two one also 'on apparent impulse' decides to not open the doors; or close them........ I understand they are ""working"" on them for upgrade but I feel a decent thing would have been to let prospective clients know of the problems BEFORE they made a booking. It was that bad that people were waiting up to 10 min for one to arrive and then getting in, even if it is going in the wrong direction, just so they don't have to wait anymore! To add insult to injury on TWO separate occasions when the lift did stop we were advised by the room cleaners we couldn't get in because it was full with them and their trollies!! Overall PRO's, clean, well maintained and friendly. CON's, lifts, nil food/bar, poor sleep due main road frontage and price for what you get.

The rooms are clean, the staff are friendly / helpful and the location is superb.Main notes to share:* Elevators - have been going through upgrades / modernization. We were reading reviews of some folks saying it took a long time and they were very slow. Over our 10 day stay, there were 3 instances that the elevators did take a long time to arrive (more than 5 minutes), but for the most part, they showed up in under 2 minutes. This may be unacceptable for some people, but if you know and are prepared for them to be slow, it's not so bad. On the day of our departure, a couple families were complaining loudly about how ridiculous it was and how unhappy they were about it. I suspect they didn't know about the situation beforehand, and if you're used to very fast elevators...yes, it can be frustrating. It didn't ruin our experience. Random: For the impatient, we were on the 14th floor and I took the stairs to see how long that would take. Approximately 3 1/2 minutes, but the faster you go, the dizzier you get.* AC / sound from the street - we don't have an AC unit at home, where we come from, so I don't know how loud or quiet these things are supposed to be. Some reviews complain of them being too loud or rattling, and at times, I suppose it can be annoying (I was just happy to be cooled off!). We opted to keep our balcony door open for the breeze at times, although at night, if the noise from the street is too much, then the AC unit works in a pinch. Earplugs, for light sleepers, perhaps.* Happy Hour - so fun! Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 5- 6pm. Very generous pours and so great to mingle with others staying at the hotel and sharing their experiences. We made a couple new Kiwi friends that we ended up going out for beers and dinner with, another night. They had entertainment (singer, uke and dancer) to keep the energy up. My favourite part, haha! They served the Kona brewery blonde and amber ale, 2 whites (pino and chardonnay), 2 reds (merlot and cab) and crackers + cheese.* Movie rentals - just for fun, free DVD rentals with pretty updated options. Great for the kids. I think they had some video games available as well. The room console only had one controller for the PS3, so no multiplayer. You might have to ask the desk if they would loan out another one.* Outdoor Yoga - Tues, Thurs, Sat and Sunday at 8am (it says to meet in the lobby at 7:45am). They provide the mats and the yoga teacher might saunter in at 8, 8:01...it's Island Time. I experienced two instructors and two different group sizes (3 people and 12 people). It's pretty random but a good experience and really nice to have this service.* Gym - small, clean and decently equipped for a total body workout. They have two treadmills, one elliptical, one bike. Rack of free weight / dumbbells (up to 50lbs) and a bench. A few machines (Leg press, leg extension, prone leg curl, row, lat pulldown, pec dec, seated bench press,roman chair, back extension). AC was on - thank god haha.* Parking - $35 per night","Vancouver, Canada","Maverick_Cat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",9,4.0

The hotel is one the main road in Waikiki and about a 5 minute walk from the beach at Ft Debussy park. The rooms were clean and the lotion great ( I'm a sucker for good smelling hotel lotion) and cleaned well each day. The pool was small but lovely with soft padded chairs. Take advantage of the available cruiser bikes and beach chairs to explore the beach and surrounding area as well as the DVD now ( like Redbox but included in hotel stay) for free movies and games so you can brush up on your Jurassic World or Aloha before seeing the sites. The rooms have two queen beds which is good for our family of two adults and two teens. Definitely get a room with a kitchenette as you don't want to each out all the time. There is a small convenience store with great sushi and good sandwiches right across the street (Whalers) and a reasonable grocery store for more items and better prices about .6 miles down Kuhio called Food Palace which is worth a walk to.

Our room was just above the lobby entrance (busy street), the AC unit's (an antiquated window unit that was mounted on the floor...no central air???) front plate was falling off and rattled but had to be used to drown out the street noise, hair dryer smelled like electrical burning, coffee maker tripped the GFI, exterior security door was left open, hallway carpeting was filthy, bathroom door knob falling apart, lanai (glorified balcony) door was left unlocked and curtains opened when we returned...who the heck would have been accessing our room when we only we ""allowed"" maid service one day??? Only two working elevators for 18 (I think) floors so the first floor wouldn't have been a bad deal in an emergency.

The rooms were reasonably priced and we honestly stayed in them both nights for less than 12 hours due to flights and excursions. With it being short overnight stays, the location and view of the ocean wasn't a big issue. Both nights we had trouble getting rooms with two queen beds we requested which made some sleeping arrangements a little uncomfortable (had to sleep in same bed with people they don't live with). For the most part the staff tried there best though some were more interested in problem solving than others. Jessica was great. They accommodated our need to store our luggage post cruise (10 am) and took it to one of the rooms when it was ready. We didn't get back to the rooms until 10:45 pm later that day so it was very helpful. Valet parking was $35 - a little high but the valets were fast, efficient and friendly.

Within walking distance to Waikiki beach, high end shopping and tons of restaurants. Thrifty car rental location within one block. Beach towels and chairs are available free of charge. ABC store right across the street. Gas station next door for soda, beer, snacks etc. hotel has no restaurant or breakfast. Elevators were a problem as there were long waits due to maintenance.

We bundled our packages to get a cheaper flight and better hotel. I did research on the hotel beforehand and it looked to be pretty neat looking. We got a kitchenette with partial ocean view. From the pictures that we saw online it showed the partial ocean view to be more open and not dead center in city view. We were able to see a small little area of the ocean, very tiny part while having to go out on balcony. From the pictures it looks like we should be able to see the ocean from just opening up our blinds but that was not the case. The room was much much smaller than we had thought, and the kitchenette was equipped with very few items and mismatched sets, older looking. The toilet was extremely screeching when you flush it, and when the housekeeping was cleaning out tub next room over all the grime and nasty stuff came up through our tub! It was gross! But with us being on our honeymoon we just wanted to enjoy the excursions and tours and spend little time in room anyways. However that became a problem when a hotel with 3 elevators was only able to service one elevator per 14 floors!!! We had to wait there sometimes 20 minutes, which then made us almost running late for excursions! Not happy, but being on the 7th floor we just did the stairs up and down many many times because it seemed to be faster! They in no way offered us any compensation, and when we asked to check out later on the day we leaving, they said we couldn't do it, but then gave us an hour, which barely worked out due to our excursion. The service was not that friendly and the cleaning was not thorough at all! The great thing that we did love about this place was our Expedia guy Tyler!

The room we booked had a waikiki beach view, which was nice to have, but being in the narrow balcony felt a bit weird. It also has a TV, Playstation (that you can use to play movies), a safe lock, fridge, coffee makers, and various utensils like plates, forks, spoons, mugs, etc.The only thing we didn't really like was that the room we booked did not have carpet.

Located just 5 minutes from the beach. Kalukawa ave is where most of the shopping is done so you are right there. There's a gas station next door with wine, beer, soda and fried chicken around the clock. So, you won't starve. The only thing I found annoying are the elevators. There was a consistent issue with them. They have only 2 as they are upgrading their elevators and one is down for the upgrade. This hotel has 16 floors so it gets crowded especially during the tourist season. The people who work here are more than nice. Never a problem. The cleaning personnel are all good. Some will even wash your dishes. I thought that was awesome. There may be better hotels, but this one would suit me anytime. I was here from the middle of May to the middle of August so I got to see it a lot. The rooms are nice. They are fairly small. If you get a room, check the A/C. Some are very noisy but they are upgrading those too. My first room sounded like a train coming through all night. When I moved due to upgrading, my next room was extremely quiet. They aren't letting things go, they are upgrading. If it weren't for the elevators, I'd of given it a 5. That because one night I had to trudge up 15 floors on the fire escape to get to my room.

It’s very reasonably priced for Waikiki, has some fantastic amenities including a decent pool and gym, and offers numerous free extras including yoga classes, speedy free wifi, beach towels and chairs, coffee & tea reception, wine & cheese evenings, and more.Our studio room was lovely, with a well-equipped kitchenette and a lanai with amazing partial views of the Pacific and Diamond Head. It’s a little rough around the edges; the shower was fairly ineffective, housekeeping was inconsistent (one day removing every single towel from the room), and the door to our lanai didn’t close all that well, allowing in a surprising amount of noise even on the 15th floor. The parking situation is annoying but pretty standard for Waikiki; it’s valet only at the hotel at $35 a day (plus tips), but we did find a large parking lot a 15-minute walk away at the marina on Holomoana St for only $1 per hour. Overall for this price and within walking distance from Waikiki Beach, we were very, very happy with Luana.So far, so 4*, and it would have remained as such were it not for the customer service we received one evening. Having picked up an injury during a half marathon earlier in the day which left me largely unable to walk, I had to cancel our dinner plans for the evening, so we tried to rescue the evening and have a nice night in instead with some takeout, alcohol, and a movie from the lobby’s DVD rental machine for our in-room PS3. The first problem came when we tried to turn the PS3 on, only to find that the HDMI cable was completely and very obviously chewed up. My wife took the console down to the lobby to try and get a new one, and we were told that someone would be right up. Having heard nothing in 45 minutes, she then phoned the lobby and was told that someone was on their way right now. Another 40 long, infuriating minutes later the maintenance guy actually turned up, and he had absolutely no idea what he was there for. To be fair to him he brought a new cable within 5 minutes, and we finally settled down and popped the disc in. Only to see a message on-screen stating that the disc couldn’t be viewed because the console’s encryption key was out of date and needed updating – which we couldn’t do, because the hotel have prevented the consoles going online – leaving the movie literally unwatchable and the entire evening completely wasted. This incident completely ruined an already bad day and really shouldn’t have happened – why bother having this technology in the rooms if no-one’s ever going to check that they work, and why say that someone’s on their way up to the room when they’re obviously not?Honestly I still feel uncomfortable about giving Luana just 3*; there was a lot about it I absolutely loved. But the reality is that this is one of the only times I’ve ever received bad service from an American hotel, and even as a fairly easy going traveller who will happily put up with a lot without ever complaining, that whole evening of poor service and outright lying is enough to ensure that I would never stay there again. However if all you’re looking for is a relatively cheap base hotel then you could do a lot worse than Luana.","Chester, United Kingdom","Scruff_UK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chester, United Kingdom</strong>",138,3.0

It takes just 5 minutes to walk to the beach, or 15 minutes to be on the famous Waikiki Beach. The hotel lobby is beautiful, and staff give a friendly holiday atmosphere. The managers offer free drinks and canapes to guests 3 times a week, a nice touch to show they are passionate hosts. I have stayed in 2 rooms now, both had full kitchen facilities, which was great to be able to prepare food and not have to eat every meal out.

It was such a relief, after a short sleep on a long flight. We had a studio apartment on a city-view, high floor for two nights before joining a cruise. It was very good in all respects, apart from one aspect - the old-fashioned air-conditioner was far too noisy for modern days. (it was one of those units inside the room). We went to the tManager's reception 5-6pm for ordinary wine and local entertainment - one ukelele and a hula dancer.The kitchenette set up was not put to any real test as we ate salads, cooked meats, fruit and breakfast foods from the ABC store right across the street (slimming down for a week of cruise-ship food!) It worked well for what we demanded of it.Luana has a novel and easy-to-use DVD loan system. There's a self-serve cabinet on the mezzanine floor which dispenses disks using the guest card.

Cars are parked by valet, there's fruited water in the lobby, free newspapers, free DVDs, very helpful desk agents. There's a rather amazing free guest reception Friday nights, with wine and an assortment of pupus. When you check out, they give you free cookies. The rooms are squeaky clean, large enough, have balconies and nice amenities. The decor was a little on the cold, clinical side for me with the tile floors and spare approach, but most would probably not mind it. Why only three starts, then? Because the bottom line in any hotel experience is how well did you sleep, and in our case, the answer at the Luana was hardly at all. First of all, the pillows were hard as rocks. I was shocked, actually, that they weren't even medium firmness. No, they were more like what the ancient Egyptians must have used on their stone beds. Then there was the fact that the door to the room didn't fit the frame well, so that huge amounts of light streamed in from the hallway all night. I tried stuffing rolled towels in the gap between the floor and the door, but there were gaps on top and the sides so it didn't work. The poor doorframe fit also meant we could hear guests in the hallway as if they were in our room. Also, an alarm went off at 4:45 and we thought it was in our room, but it wasn't, meaning we could hear through the walls.I wouldn't stay here again, and that's sad because so much was so right here, but again, if it doesn't work for sleeping, it's not a good bet.","Hendersonville, North Carolina","Eleuthera10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hendersonville, North Carolina</strong>",14,3.0

I frantically searched the internet for another hotel to book last minute in Waikiki and stumbled upon the Luana Waikiki. I called the Luana and spoke to Allan at the front desk and explained our situation, He was able to secure us a room with a kitchenette for a great rate for the six nights we were to be in Honolulu. Upon arriving at the hotel, Allan re-checked the rates and was able to get us an even better rate than he originally quoted. Allan must have felt sorry for us for the rotten experience we had just been through, because he made sure our room was located on the 15th floor with a fantastic view of the ocean and Diamond Head. Our room also overlooked a beautiful park. Thanks Allan - you really saved the day for us!The location of this hotel was great as it was close to everything - beach, shopping, food. All areas were clean and inviting. The staff was friendly and accommodating - from the concierge, who booked our tickets at the Polynesian Cultural Centre, to the valet's who parked our car. Another perk is that this hotel is very close to where you can view the firework show offered every Friday over Waikiki Beach. It was a 10 minute walk to the beach from the Luana for optimal viewing. However, if you have a room on the west side of the Luana you could probably witness the fireworks from your balcony.There is a $35/day parking fee which is a little on the high end but well worth it. Most reputable hotels here charge a fee for parking - it is just something you have to expect in Waikiki. If you cheap out to avoid this, you will end up with an experience like we initially did. My advice if travelling to Honolulu is to do your research or, better yet, just book at the Luana Waikiki for a guaranteed great vacation!",Edmonton,"Moester3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton</strong>",11,5.0

This hotel is at the quieter end of Waikiki and perfectly placed for easy access to the Fort DeRussey beach which is much less crowded than the main section of Waikiki beach (a mere 7 minute walk). There is an ABC store just across the road and Hard Rock Cafe about 5 minutes away, with the main hub of the shops/restaurants of Lewers St just a couple of minutes further. A great location for a very nice hotel. The check-in staff were prompt and friendly. Whenever we had a question or required anything, they were very quick to respond and happy to help. The decor is traditional Hawaiian and in good condition. Coffee and bathroom amenities were well provided and replenished. The Manager's wine and cheese reception is a lovely idea and a good way to mingle with other guests. I had every intention to make it to a free yoga class, but at 7.45am, it just didn't happen! Our bed was probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in while on holiday, which was a bonus. The amenity fee is well worth it and we watched quite a few DVDs during our stay.

The reception staff couldn't have been nicer. Our friends booked this hotel in January through Costco, requesting adjoining rooms. But, when we checked in, the reception staffer, Mike, told us they never look at these written requests, so we couldn't be accommodated and was placing us on separate floors. But, Mike finally gave us 2 rooms on the 3rd floor, with a wall separating us! We overlooked the air conditioning units below but could see the ocean from our balcony. However, I was very surprised that the following basic features were missing: no in hotel restaurant or bar, no staff to help with luggage, no microwave oven, no hooks on the back of the bathroom door to hang wet towels, no safety grab bars in the shower, housekeeping didn't replace the plastic cups in the bathroom, nor wash the barware or tabletops, and no plastic liner in the ice bucket. The room did provide cutlery/plates, a refrigerator and safe for valuables. The pluses were a wine and cheese reception on Mon/Wed/Fri. Between 5-6p, which was part of the mandatory $15/day/room amenities fee, which also covered free trolley service around Waikiki. One major convenience was meeting Elton, a reception desk staffer, who showed us how to access our boarding passes for the next day, and ended up printing them for us. Elton, and Mike, should both be recognized for their professionalism and friendly manner. After partaking of the island meals, we did enjoy dipping in the outdoor pool and using the scale in the gym!

The hotel is located at the beginning of the strip so it will be a good walk to Waikiki (maybe around 15 mins?). It's still very convenient though and we even walked to Ala moana centre (around 15 mins walk) so everything is pretty much walking distance. If you don't want to walk to Ala Moana, the hotel provides free shuttle that leaves every 30 mins or so. It might be worth mentioning that the hotel doesn't provide pick up from the airport so you need to book shuttle from Speedy shuttle. We used A8 Shuttle because it charge a flat $35 for taxi shuttle from the airport to the hotel so it works out better if there are more than 2 of you travelling. It's also worth mentioning that A8 doesn't charge extra even if you need to leave for airport at the crack of dawn.

It was a 1st floor room, facing an alley. The best part is that I emailed the hotel 1 day later and never got a call until I completed a generic guest survey that was sent a few days later. I got a call from Destiny, who only kept apologizing, as though it was her first day on the job. She offered a future room at the same AAA discount we got! How very generous. The hotel has potential, but service is lacking.","Palm Springs, California","ManOnTheMove</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palm Springs, California</strong>",57,2.0

It does not get any better for a budget hotel. The rates are very reasonable for the area. The hotel is located on the main drag in Waikiki so it is perfect for walking to shopping or dining. Directly beside and behind the hotel is Ft. Derussy park so the short walk to the beach is thru the park and not along busy streets. The hotel staff and concierge were very helpful and friendly. Our room (512) was typical hotel size, and included a small kitchenette (small refrigerator, microwave, sink, dishes etc.). Coffee and tea in the lobby in the mornings. Managers reception Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays with free wine, beer, cheese and live music. They supply beach towels and offer a free movie rental each day. Our room even had a live orchid. Cons: The street below can get a bit noisy at times but nothing unbearable. The walls are thin so you can hear people walking by the room and next door. Also, some parts of the hotel and rooms could use a bit of updating and renovating. But how much time do you spend in the room?

James, out the front, in particular was always helpful with advice, booking taxis, how to catch buses etc. Wherever we went in the hotel staff were friendly, smiling and helpful. They were the true highlight of our stay. The Luana is in a great location. It is a 5 minute walk to the beach ( Fort DeRussy Beach) or the center of Waikiki. 7/11 type shops, restaurants, coffee shops are all within a few minutes walk. A Food Pantry supermarket is 10 minutes away if you need to stock up on groceries ( a bit cheaper than 7/11 stores and a lot more variety).Tea and coffee are provided in the lobby every morning and there is a cheese and wine hour 3 times a week, all enjoyable. Dancing and music was a bit cheesy but its a nice way to meet other guests.The pool area is small but very pleasant. Free DVD's handy. Tour desk for advice. The gym looked modern with lots of equipment. ATM in lobby ( fee for usage is higher than other places we tried though) We had a 1 bedroom ocean view suite, which whilst clean and quite comfortable was in desperate need of updating. The furniture is very dated,old TV but the worst is the A/C units, old fashioned,not particularly efficient and very noisy,especially when one is 3 feet from where you are trying to sleep. We opted to turn them off and leave the door open instead, though this let in traffic noise.There was a lovely large kitchen with good appliances, handy if you were staying with children or wanted to save a few $$ by not buying every meal but some better utensils would have made this more useful. A microwave with no microwavable dishes? an oven with nothing you can cook with in it? a set of saucepans and a couple of metal bowls are all that is provided for actual cooking. A good range of cutlery and crockery, coffee maker and a rice maker are provided.We wanted to do laundry but the machines were in constant use ( there were quite a number but its a large hotel) then finally the laundry was closed for renovations and we had to lug washing down the street to a launderette and pay a lot more than the hotel charged for machine usage. It was advertised by signage in the lifts but it was still annoying as part of the reason for booking this hotel was the kitchen and laundry facilities.We enjoyed our stay but feel this hotel could be so much better. The A/C is something that really needs urgent attention.","Tuggeranong, Australia","GeorgetteCanberra</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tuggeranong, Australia</strong>",180,3.0

Although I didn't use them, the pool and exercise facilities looked really nice. Also, every Wednesday and Friday evening they have a wine tasting.

We stayed at this hotel based on the overall high rating for five nights and our first night was in a suite with ocean view and unfortunately we have to say our room was a disaster, the two window mounted air conditioners were extremely noisy and our bed was as hard as a rock. This was the first bed we have ever slept on where we were both stiff and sore the next morning. The positive was the staff are exceptional and we were moved to another room the next day which was equipped without window mounted air conditioners, had a ceiling fan in living room and a comfortable bed. The downside was the patio doors in the bedroom are not soundproof and you can hear road noise and sirens all night long. I can only rate the two rooms we stayed in and our expectation for what we paid for the room and what we received unfortunately did not match. Another positive is the location is fantastic and close to restaurants and the beach.","Regina, Canada","PatMcKenzie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Regina, Canada</strong>",39,3.0

Its a condo/hotel so the owners/management should strongly consider upgrading.The positive thing about this hotel was the friendly service we received from all staff. They were all very efficient and helpful. Reception staff and bellmen were all great. We had the 2 bedroom suite booked, along with a few other regular rooms, as we were a group of 9. This hotel is useful to help manage costs, as its affordable for Waikiki. Location is good for walking to the beach through a nice park (10 min) and its at one end of Kalakaua, so easy to walk to the shops. If you are booking, be aware of a few things:- City view rooms are very noisy from being on the main street and lack of proper sound proof windows. Pay a bit more for the partial ocean view room and you'll sleep better- Air conditioning units are very noisy, no central air, so these clunky units are in each room- the 2BR has a large lanai, but we couldn't use it, as the noise from the HVAC and lack of comfortable furniture made it impossible to use- A complete overhaul is needed to upgrade the bathroom fixtures, furniture, floor tiles, etc, as the rooms all had cracks in the floor, sinks with drainage problems and taps that are difficult - There is a $15 resort fee added to your bill at the end of the stay. Many hotels are now using this scheme, which is bothersome. This hotel is not a resort, so it bothered me that I had to pay a resort fee.- There is no bar or restaurant, so be aware of this if you are looking for the services you would get in most hotels from food and beverages. I would like to end on a positive. - The rooms are well equipped with kitchen facilities, which is great for families and fills the need if you aren't looking to eat or drink at your resort. The 2BR has a washer/dryer, which came in handy- Free coffee in the reception area in the morning was appreciated- The manager hosts a free wine and cheese event 3x per week. We attended one night, but couldn't tell who the manager was, didn't see anyone from their staff roaming around meeting guests. Not sure this is needed. Overall, this hotel is fine for families and people on a budget. If you are more particular with the quality of the hotel facilities you like to stay at, then this hotel is not for you. Unfortunately, due to the overall conditions, I would not stay there again.","Toronto, Canada","159SharonR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",35,3.0

Maybe a suggestion of soft drinks or a juice may be worth thinking about.

Our safe did not work. Reception was always friendly and happy to help with any inquiries. Did not use the free shuttle as it was faster to catch the Waikiki Shuttle Pink Line and pay $2 each. It is less than a 5 minute walk away and comes every 10 minutes and doesn't take the 40 minutes the shuttle does. I would recommend if you are going to Ala Moana to use this shuttle but when you get off, get off at the Trump International Hotel stop otherwise you will have to do a big loop to get back to your original get on spot. Recommend you to get a City view room. You will most likely have the A/C on which cancels any potential city noise. The ocean view is more expensive and isn't that great of a view anyways.

I called this property every month, approx every 4 weeks from initial booking until arrival to ensure that nothing happened to our room as we have several A.D.A. people in our party. We are all seasoned travellers and have stayed all over the world in a variety of different lodging to Cruise Ship state rooms etc. Nothing prepared us for initial check in. Upon receipt of our keys and room (1604) we arrived to a top floor corner with a lovely view of Fort Derussy Park and the Beach beyond. This would normally have placated just about anyone, but as I mentioned there were 3 of us in our party. Two of us are large strapping men, who most certainly did not want to share a single King Bed. Yes, that's right, we were given a suite with a single king bed. I called down to the front desk immediately, and was told 'didn't I know there was a sofa bed?'... yes of course there is, for a toddler! Not for either one of us over 6 feet and 200 plus pounds! Never mind I specified a room type of 2 Queen beds and felt the one in our party under 6 feet wasn't worried about the size of the sofa bed, but it was a single person bed. At this point the front desk clerk informs us 'we don't guarantee room types', then why on earth would anyone book a king size or a double queen set of beds when they book? How crazy is this? Obviously I call back and try to get a hold of the manager. I am informed 'there is no manager, they might be in tomorrow'... CLICK, and get hung up on. As if this isn't bad enough, our door doesn't close right and barely latches, it appeared to have been kicked open. The front desk is now refusing to answer the phone repeatedly for over 20 minutes; obviously I return to the lobby. At this point there is no one that will help me and the clerk at the front desk sneers in our faces that that's the way it is! $3000 plus dollars and frequent month calls plus initial booking... and that's the way it is? BE WARNED!After negotiating again for 10-15 minutes we finally secure a promise of the maintenance man coming to fix our door so that it will at least close and lock; which Luana's maintenance team happily does. The friendly joking service guy apologised while fixing our door. It is now well after 5 and we are still waiting for the last of our party to arrive, the final 6 foot plus guy. In this time I return to the lobby and speak to another front desk clerk who graciously offers a child size hide away cot for our under 6 foot to use while the other 6 foot plus we are waiting for arrives. Did I mention all of the over 6 feet are ADA and need 'real' beds? We weren't asking for special treatment, just what we had booked and paid over $3000 for! Again, with a promise the manager would 'call us first thing in the morning' we retreated to our very unsatisfactory room. We now had the short term bedding situation sorted, but the air conditioner kept rattling in the main living room, so we pressed on the control panel, sure enough the front of the a/c housing and unit fell off... as if that wasn't enough we tried to close the patio door and it appeared the moth mafia had taken a hit out on the living room draperies as they were covered in 1920's style machine gun bullet hole holes... bizarre. Once our final party arrived we agreed to speak to the manager the following day, and just rest from the lengthy travelling we had all done. This was Tuesday the 19th of January, 2016. Wednesday the 20th arrived, no manager calls, no manager on site, nothing but front desk staff that could care less, but the good news is we were in Waikiki and it was warm, we left our hotel by taxi for brunch. After a short hop around the avenue malls and shops we returned before 3pm to enquire, yet again as we had on the way out, if there were any new rooms with double queens available as sleeping was extremely uncomfortable and we didn't pay over $3000 to sleep on cots. Again, 'the manager isn't in we'll look into it for you'... another fake platitude.At this point we arranged for a rental car the following day on the 21st, Thursday. In the mean time we headed to the swimming pool, I'd say it was down several gallons of Chlorox,as everyone exiting complained about burning sinuses, throat from inhaling the air, and red eyes.We returned to the front desk where a senior staff member, I can only guess this because he took the time to actually look in the computer for a room, and found guests checking out on the 22nd of January. Great, one more sleepless night for our party. We all agreed to try and pack up early so we could take our stuff into the rental car early the following morning and head out for our circle island drive. Pretty safe to do when you haven't slept because there were springs in your back from the sofa bed all night... It really feels like a $30 sleep not three thousand!The next morning we checkout of 1604 and get into our rental car, heading out to Hanauma Bay for a day at the beach relaxing. I highly recommend you see this natural bay, we arrived around noon after the morning rush had died down and found parking near the entrance to the pavilion. After a day at the beach we returned in the rental car and checked it in to the Luana Waikiki valet, you can not self park and they are entrusted with your vehicle. As I handed over the keys to our new 2015 Nissan Altima, I had no idea what was to happen the next day.Upon check-in to the front desk at 3:30pm in the afternoon on January 21st (2 days after initial arrival) we received the keys to room 606, a bright airy room overlooking the swimming pool and the park. This room is slightly noisier than 1604 as the avenue branches off below into the main part here (Kalakaua Ave) and the side avenue Kuhio Ave. This creates a lot of traffic noise on this side of the building, and the 24 hour gas bar below.We finally feel that we are in the right room that we paid for, requested, and deserved after so much negotiating and unnecessary awkwardness; then the shoe drops. We open the door to the TV set and it's an old style tube TV, with VHS player... I know we are in Hawaii, but for these prices, this was hysterically funny. Worse than that, we discover this is a 3 person 1 bug arrangement. We end up sharing our bathroom with a giant cockroach. Every time one of us 3 turns on the bathroom light, we get a visit from our little friend scurrying around. We can only ascertain he has more personality than Luana management.On the morning of January 22nd, we arrive to the Luana Waikiki Valet and attempt to pick up our rental Nissan. It is at this time that we notice an extreme amount of damage to the vehicle. The drivers side mirror has been impacted and nearly taken off, I am left to try and push it back on so it doesn't finish falling off. There are dents and scratches all over the entire vehcile including the hood and roof and it appears that it was backed into something as well as rammed forward. The valet immediately, with hands at his side, states 'oh it was like that when I got it'... VERY much not at all! I immediately demand to have Honolulu police contacted who arrive on scene and make a record and case note about the damage. After almost 2 hours of documentation and the Valet 'ADAM' swearing up and down that he did nothing wrong, the police give me my card with file number and send us on our way. We narrowly averted disaster on our arrival time for the Polynesian Cultural Centre because we were detained by Luana's damage to our vehicle. At least the entire day wasn't ruined. I recommend this point of interest as well, the Polynesian Cultural Centre is a wonderful group of experiences and a fun drive to the North Side of Oahu.Upon returning to the hotel, and with assurances by the NEW 'not Adam' valet person we agreed to park our rental in their care. Which as you will note was a continuing disaster from the get go.Saturday we continued to explore more of Waikiki, and the Hawaiian Prince dinner buffet etc. Recommend the Sushi highly in Hakone!Sunday Morning we again pickup our rental car and note that not only the previous damage that was done to it, but the right rear passenger side has been scraped up against something and FURTHER damage was done. At this time I demand to speak to the police, and ADAM is now the valet on site, smiling and grinning while laughing hysterically. This is obviously a joke and fun for Luana's VIP staff, destroying rental cars is no big deal because well it's fun and a victimless crime right? How Narcissistic and Sociopathic do you have to be to enjoy damaging property in this way? Apparently Adam is without explanation as three Honolulu Police Officers respond to the scene! Suddenly Adam isn't smiling any more, in fact he's white and shaking nervously as the police ask him to fill out a statement for them and insist on contacting his managers because there ARE camera's in their parking garage. Funny how their demeanor changes when authority arrives? At this point I complete a second police statement, receive a second police file number, and pack up my party and head off this disgusting property. By the way, the manager at this time of both the hotel and the valet show up. The hotel manager immediately jumps to luggage must have damaged my rental car. Yes ladies and gentleman luggage took the side mirror off my rental car and dented the fenders, pushed in the front bumper, and and luggage again scraped up the side of the car. The Valet manager refused to comment or make any statement, but was handily taking pictures of our car while dodging questions.Our day was spent driving to Turtle Bay and the rest of the North Shore. I highly recommend staying out here, it's not a pretty hotel, but the views are stunning and as I've been here on previous occasions; they won't demolish your rental car.After returning to Honolulu in the evening and contacting the rental car assistance centre AGAIN, I make the decision to cut our rental short and return the car, Sunday evening as we can simply not trust Luana Waikiki at all. This trust has been broken in so many levels it's appalling that anyone could run a hotel this way.After we drop the rental car off at Honolulu airport, pay for our own taxi van back to this dreadful property we find that the maid service has simply pulled the blankets over the pillows left in our bed and refused to clean our room. There are dishes in the sink I do myself and garbage I empty into a bag and leave in the hallway as I don't want it in our room. Obviously the maid staff have been given orders by their hotel manager not to serve us at all. After cleaning our room, we all collapse into our beds and try to forget this nightmare. Ahh Monday, the 25th of January, I proceed to do laundry in the morning. The one amenity of this hotel that is lovely; self serve laundry. I shudder to imagine if Luana had a laundry service, you're clothes might come out like our rental car.We walk over to our now favorite Oasis in Waikiki Eggs N Things... they recognise us instantly. My favorite meal is the grilled Ahi Tuna steak and eggs with Wasabi sauce. This is highly recommended as well. We head back to the hotel for an afternoon nap and rest. It is this point where I decide to catch our little cockroach friend. I sneak into the bathroom and have one of my friends turn the bathroom light on. Success, I catch it in an old pill bottle. Ugh! Well that's almost as exciting as the Monday Wednesday Friday wine and cheese party on the Mezzanine Level bar. Ahh, Tuesday, thank goodness, time to check out and get out of this dump. Which by the way has advertisements all over for it's annual condominium HOA board meetings. You see, this isn't a hotel, NO no... Luana is a Condominium that uses it's slum hotel to subsidise the tenants living there. Be warned!At 11:50am we check out, I request a zero balance print out and am told they don't do that. What hotel doesn't do this? I demand that a screen capture or some other receipt be issued to show that we have in fact paid our balance. Grudgingly the clerk agrees and prints off the screen capture I ask for. I am then asking what about my $100 deposit on my credit card, and assured it will be removed in a few days time. As of this writing on February 9th 2016, Luana has chosen to NOT credit back my hotel deposit. I have made several calls to the management, and as you guessed - haven't been returned.The best part of Tuesday the 26th of January 2016 was leaving. I have never felt this disappointed, drained, and frankly appalled by a hotel in a VERY long time. I urge anyone thinking of staying here to remember that because the pictures look good - it doesn't have to be! If anyone gives a good review, they are either paid by Luana or blind... and if you're blind, I'm sorry you had to endure this property.Further the restaurant in this hotel is nonexistent and under reno's - permanently - a fancy way of saying run down beyond belief and closed by the health board. Like everything Luana, it was a complete hell hole.By the way, at no time did the Luana Hotel manager or Valet manager ever offer to compensate us, nor did they offer to pay for my renters insurance they most certainly made us of. No one did anything other than deny any responsibility and continue to ensure our stay was even worse than before.I urge you to look at my pictures, and ask yourself if this is how you want to spend your hard earned money and be treated.","Edmonton, Canada","KLMcNabb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",31,1.0

Please wash the floors (scrubbing with soap), it is essential that the accumulation of dirt over decades be gone!!!I chose a hotel without carpets because I expected it to be cleaner, but I was very disappointed…. The common areas were better kept, specially the lobby and pool areas.Second: OLD, nothing has been renovated in decades! Furniture is poor because it takes a lot of space and offers little storage space. Everything is too dark, counters and floors, furniture, please make it lighter, it looks like a cave!AC is too noisy, we turned it off (was not necessary) and never turned it on again!Cooking is possible but keep in mind that there is the bare minimum! Internet??? A great joke, works one min and not the next, intermittent should I say?Nonetheless, most staff was professional and helpful, the ""manager reception"" (3 days per week) and yoga classes (4 days per week) were a reasonable highlight.Over the last 25 years I've stayed in various hotels in Honolulu during Xmas peak season, so I believe that relative to more highly priced hotels (Sheraton Waikiki, Hilton Hawaiian village, Hyatt Waikiki, etc) this is an economic choice for families.Finally, I confess that I was greatly dissatisfied with reviews I read in ""tripadvisor"" that evaluated this hotel much higher than it deserves!

Both times I tried to use the DVD player to watch a movie (there's a free Redbox-type rental station in the lobby) I had to have someone from maintenance come in to make the AV equipment work. At least two of the three elevators had service outages during the four days I was there, too. The tile floors in the rooms get swept every other day, which is a problem if you track sand in from the beach, which anyone staying here is bound to do. The window a/c unit was old and very noisy.The whole property has an air of neglect, as if the owner is preoccupied with his other enterprises, and with his large collection of very expensive classic cars, one of which is parked in a prominent place near the front door every day.

I resorted to the concierge several times to get some tips on visiting other parts of the island and again, they were very attentive. The room and amenities were adequate for us- fitness room, a small pool, a kitchenette area in the room. A few small downsides for us were the shower which didn't seem to work properly all the time and the fact that there is no restaurant or breakfast offered.

The reasons ... Location, Outstanding Hospitality, and, above all, Staff Conviviality.Situated at the edge of Fort DeRusssy Park, the quieter end of Waikiki, it affords one a very short walk through the Park to the beach. To savour the hustle and bustle of the shops, restaurants, bars and night life of Waikiki, these are a mere two blocks along Kalakauha Avenue towards Diamond Head. In the opposite direction, the ever-evolving and increasingly ""upscale"" Ala Moana Shopping Centre awaits!We have always arranged for a room with kitchenette on the highest floor possible on the Diamond Head side. It faces the Park and has a fine partial ocean view. The vistas are excellent as no high-rises are immediately in front. The same can be said for the opposite side towards the lush mountains.Daily room house-keeping is thorough and the staff are efficient and very friendly. Public spaces are immaculate, the pool deck is extremely comfortable, the two barbecues are great for those wishing whip-up ""your inner-chef"" dinner bills of fare, and should you be at the hotel on a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., the Manager's wine and cheese reception is excellent. Music with a graceful Hula dancer bring a lovely ambience whilst you chat with guests from far and wide.The daily Resort Fee lists many items to make you stay memorable. This past visit we took advantage of the touring bicycles and did a very early Sunday morning cycle out past the Diamond Head Lighthouse and beyond to the Waialae Golf and Country Club in the Kalaha District of the Island. Also available are beach chairs, floats, tubes, and other sun-worshipping paraphernalia. Current DVDs are free from the kiosk on the mezzanine floor.Kudos go to the very affable manager Rudy Fao and all the staff with whom we dealt. Jacqueline and Sunny at guest services, Elton and Jess at the front desk, Trace who manned the luggage and signed out the beach items, Destiny who manages and oversees Housekeeping, and Mark and all the greeters and servers who make the Manager's Wine and Cheese so enjoyable. The valet staff stationed outside at the driveway's edge always offer welcoming pleasantries as you enter or leave the hotel.","Vancouver, Canada","Snowridge_10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",9,5.0

We were celebrating a couple of special occasions and the hotel provided us with a lovely bottle of wine shortly after arrival. The Luana has everything we need for a comfortable stay; the kitchenette units are sufficient, we loved the BBQ patio, and the on site laundry facilities are very convenient. We very much enjoyed the ""Happy Hour"" festivities which take place 3 times per week, a very nice touch! We find the location ideal, just far enough away from the ""craziness"" of Waikiki but still close enough to walk everywhere.

The elevators will annoy you, as they are terribly slow. The staff were friendly except for James who is a bellman who is a bit abrasive. He felt the need to lecture us every time we rented bikes about how we need to take care of them and that they are new, etc. You would think after the 3rd time we rented and returned them in perfect condition, he would let up.

Our 1 bedroom apartment had an extremely spacious bedroom with a king bed and a compact living room with a sofa bed and en-suite sized bathroom. Everything was immaculately clean and cleaned and serviced every day. The staff on reception and housekeeping were very helpful and courteous. The concierge was really knowledgeable ,friendly and helpful too. The only downsides were that the air conditioning units were extremely noisy ( too noisy to leave on at night ) and there are no insect screens so it was quite hot at times. There was a noisy party above us on the final night but after a complaint to reception it was shut down quite quickly.

On driving to the hotel, we passed a building site next door and Gas station, right next to the hotel so first impressions weren't great. I asked when checking in that we didn't have a view of either of these but we did and couldn't change rooms. However, we had a room on the 9th floor and my initial worries disappeared. The view of Waikiki was great with the ocean peaking though. The balcony is very small and not good if you don't like heights. The room was good, not plush and a little dated maybe in the bathroom but it suited us fine for a base in Waikiki. The location is perfect, 8-10 minutes walk (depending on how slow you are) to Waikiki beach. All the top shops are within spitting distance from the hotel, Tiffanys, Chanel, Gucci etc and out favourite bar, Arnold's was 2 minutes walk. We never had a problem with the elevators.

I want a room that is nice and clean and comfortable. I booked this room based on all the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. I wanted to love it.I am sitting in my room as I write this.Pros: love the location. Quick walk to anything you need as well as the beaches. Our room (909) has a beautiful view of the Ocean and its comfortable and spacious. We have a kitchenette and its great. The people who work here are super friendly and helpful. Gym is good. Wine and cheese nice. Cons: Our room has not been made up until at least 2 pm every day. Today we came in from the rain after being out from 7 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and our room was not done. We didn't have fresh towels and we wanted to shower again due to being soaked from the rain. When they finally came (she knocked once and walked in - I was in my bra and underwear!) we asked for a few minutes (to dress) and then vacated the room. But the housekeeper was gone but her cart was there. So we went back in the room, cleaned it up, tossed our towels in a heap, emptied our pails (which didn't get emptied every day by the way) and we took clean towels off the cart and trash can liners to put in the pails. When she got back (15 minutes later) we told her to forget it. We did it ourselves. She was very sweet and smiling and thanking us. But really?The tub is slippery....really dangerous. I can't believe they don't put a rubber mat down.The beach chairs, while ""free"", which is nice, are very uncomfortable. Get there early if you want beach umbrellas. One day my husband went down to get an beach umbrella at 7:00 in the morning and we were told there were none left...at 7:00 a.m.?? There is a Playstation (not a DVD player) in the room. Ours didn't work and they sent someone to fix it but who clearly didn't know what he was doing. They then tried replacing it with another one that didn't work. Eventually someone figured it out (thanks Michelle!) But not until we realized that the PS3 was actually ruining the DVDs (which we brought from home). They were nice about it though and very apologetic, offering to waive the daily $15 a day fee.The elevators are bizarre as well as slow as can be. You push the button and wait thinking that the elevator is on its way. When you look again, the button is no longer lit. They were working on one while we were here and I think the service elevator may be broken so sometimes you are riding the elevator with the housekeeping staff and dirty linens. Plus the hallways are not air conditioned, so you are waiting in the heat.Again, the people are very nice and courteous. But I really don't think I'd choose to stay here again.","West Isli, United States","520markc520</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Isli, United States</strong>",10,3.0

The reviews sounded perfect, and I was congratulating myself on another TripAdvisor win when we pulled up late at night last week. The lobby is in good shape, and the initial greeting and setup were quick and professional. However, our room (420, in case anyone cares) was in very shabby condition. The draft excluder at the front door of the room was cracked and broken, making a loud dragging sound. The dresser was worn, the wardrobe was missing a knob, and was covered in plastic shreds and dust. The shower was funky, with a rusty head and tricky controls, making a cool shower a near-impossibility. The door to the lanai was a fire door, not sliding and had dirty broken stucco. My four year old easily stuck his head between the rails on the lanai, which seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen, and meant the door stayed shut most of the time (but not locked, as the lock opened from the inside automatically). The AC was hugely loud, as previously mentioned in other reviews.You got a sense they focused their efforts on the common areas in terms of updating and cleaning, but I also noticed the employee door right by the concierge desk was very dirty and needed a paint job. The staff were friendly and efficient, although the concierge looked like he wished he was anywhere else but there most of the time. The wine and cheese reception was awesome, the beach towels, the pool, all other amenities were in good shape.My only other sour note was that the beaches were closed in Waikiki due to sewage the morning of our first day. Not the hotel's fault AT ALL, obviously, but the only reason I knew about it was because I happened to look at the front page of a newspaper in the lobby. The staff checked me out the towels without a word, and it was only when I went back and asked them that they acknowledged the situation. Eventually, someone in charge put up a notice, but it took a full day after the incident.Maybe there are other rooms that are better, and we got the crappiest room (which we paid full advertised price, so it wasn't a cheapo deal or anything). Maybe Aqua taking over meant the budget for maintenance was cut, I don't know...but overall I was disappointed.","Vancouver, BC","drbecca</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, BC</strong>",19,3.0

The staff are definitely friendly and mostly helpful, but this is a very basic hotel at a busy intersection, with a few minor frills. The rooms are small, and the beautiful vintage furniture is somehow lost next to the more recent upgrades in the kitchenette and bathroom areas, incongruous with the gorgeous lobby areas. Even though we supposedly had a special rate, we had friends who stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki for only $25 more per night (also a special rate), with full blown resort amenities.There were no bellhops, no restaurant, and the elevators were slow. We couldn't get on the internet at first. The receptionist said it was my browser, which I knew wasn't true. When the ""technical support"" came, she was just a regular maintenance worker who didn't know anything more than the front desk. I finally called Time-Warner Cable, and they found that our internet access point was saturated with too many users, probably long gone. Since it isn't password protected, it might have been freeloaders outside the hotel. After it was working, the internet was still slow at times.When we asked for a cab reservation for the next morning, the receptionist said the cab could be called on the spot. We asked for a reservation anyway. The next morning, we found that no reservation had been made. Also, the cab company they use has cabbies who barely speak English. They don't understand what you need and end up wasting your time and charging you more.We stayed for 2 weeks, and our first room overlooked a gas station and the lanai door let in all the busy street and construction noise. When we asked for another room, they were able to change it, but only a few days later. The new room was much better, but we had to do a ridiculous rigamarole of getting ALL our stuff out of the first room, checking out, and only then putting stuff into the new room -- even though the new room was already made up! An incredible hassle, esp without any bellhops and one person moving two people's stuff. No other hotel ever made me do that. On the positive side, the reception did manage our complicated billing arrangements efficiently and cheerfully.The kitchenette area was a nice surprise, and when we asked about a microwave, to our shock, they sent one up. So that does add value. The maids are really friendly, and the hula at the wine reception was lovely.Overall though, this place is seriously overrated and shouldn't have a Tripadvisor Certificate of Excellence, unless you're really paying a discount rate. But to their credit, when I said so in my customer survey, I was pleasantly surprised by a quick response refunding our hospitality fees, so they really do try to make you happy. Luana has a lot of potential, but it just wasn't the relaxing time I'd expected.","New York City, New York","Andri07</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",63,3.0

It is probably close to 900 sq ft, finished with terra cotta floor tiles and what looked like real Koa wood doors, trim, and cabinets. The kitchen had everything except an oven.Huge fridge, dishwasher, two commercial hot plates, and all the utensils and plates,etc, you would need for 4. The one bedroom had a queen bed that actually was comfortable for my back. The living room had a queen size Murphy fold down, plus a long sofa that dropped into sleeping bed as well. The bathroom is huge, with walk in shower and ample room for storage for long term stays. This must have been the manager's private residence at one time. You can hear some sidewalk and street noise in the early morning and evening, but Waikiki is pretty quiet all night long and it was not a problem at all. The Pool and BBQ area are 1 floor up and in the back of the hotel, overlooking Ft. DeRussey park and the ocean in the back ground. No other hotels or buildings in between.

The only exclusion is the $15 per day resort fee which covers wifi (each room had their own wifi account), yoga classes at 7:45 am on certain mornings, wine/cheese gatherings on the Mezzanine level 3 times a week, dvd/PS game rentals, shuttle down Kalakaua Ave and to Ala Moana Center, beach chairs and bikes. Tried twice to borrow the bikes but a big family beat us to it. Attended the wine and cheese gathering twice - the musician/ukulele player/singer and the hula dancer were very good. The shuttle to Ala Moana takes 45 minutes so we took the bus instead which takes 5 minutes plus a 5 minute walk ($2.50 per person, exact change only, buses do not give out change).

I appreciate this location, as you can easily walk to the beach, shopping or many restaurants. There is an ABC Store (convenience store) across the street, and a gas station right next door. I drive a lot when I'm in Hawaii, and Waikiki is notorious for its traffic. This is at the end of the strip, making getting in and out of the hotel and back on the H-1 pretty easy. Valet is $35/night. This is standard for Waikiki, so no complaints. If you are DoD/military and need to save money, you can look into parking at Fort Derussy behind the hotel, which should be about half the cost and a reasonable walking distance. ROOMThe rooms at Luana Waikiki are a bit dated, but very clean. They have Hawaiian decor. This didn't bother me, even though I am used to staying in more modern business hotels. Wifi functioned great, except on my Kindle (Amazon problem, not Luana), which ended up being fine as Starbucks was a hop skip jump away. No problems with A/C. Great housekeeping. They don't wash your dishes for you in the kitchenette as others have mentioned, but I would agree with this. It is time consuming for housekeeping staff, and as adults.. we can wash our own dishes we dirty. Comfy bed. Good water pressure. Can you really ask for more?AMENITIESYoga, pool, fitness center, wine reception, yada yada. I didn't use any of these, as I was there on business, but the activities seemed nice. Activities desk staff seemed helpful to guests that were looking to get off property. STAFFAs others have said.. Adam from valet was phenomenal! He remembered my name and vehicle every day, and we enjoyed a lot of good conversation. He brightened up my days, which I needed as a single business traveler. Ebony was sweet, and went above and beyond to help me get a letter drafted to my employer explaining that valet is the only parking option (so that it wouldn't be viewed as excessive). The friendly staff make this good hotel great.Next time I'm in Hawaii I won't hesitate to return. I spent 20 nights here, so I have a good feeling for the hotel. Good for long term stays (request kitchenette), and families. You could make breakfast and lunch every morning, and would be a good budget option if you've got a lot of mouths to feed.

We checked in early, so our room wasn't ready, which was expected since check in is at 3pm. We had requested for two beds way back in April when we booked the trip, but they didn't have any available, so they gave us a roll-away bed for free, which was nice. However, our studio was small, so with the queen bed, the pull-out sofa bed, and the roll-away, it was very tight. We had to make sure to stand the roll-away bed up so that we could maneuver around the room. Breakfast was served across the street at another hotel. We had buffet vouchers from Costco, so that was nice. The $15/night resort fee was fine since it covered Wi-Fi, the manager's reception, which included wine, cheese, and crackers, and DVD rentals. On our second to the last night, the water went out on the whole property. They got someone there right away, but apparently they also needed to get an electrician. My friends and I went out to dinner hoping that the water would be back on by the time we came back. It wasn't. Anyway, the water didn't come back on until either the middle of the night or very early in the morning. We know because we kept checking up until 11 pm, and then one of us went to the bathroom past midnight, and the water still wasn't working. Although this situation was beyond the hotel's control, I feel that they should have removed at least one night's resort fee. They did not do anything to compensate for the lack of water. No one could shower or anything from at least 7 pm on that evening. The way a few people at the front desk handled it was quite blasé, like it was no big deal. It was.Another thing, the elevators here are the slowest I've ever experienced. It was always hot in the hallways (maybe to save electricity), but sometimes it was uncomfortable. Enough people probably complained for them to get maintenance to take a look at the elevators. After that, they were much more efficient, though still slow (especially compared to the next hotel we stayed in). I did like the fact that there was a laundry facility in the premises. I hated that the pool closed so early.","Montrose, California","wanderingtrtl11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montrose, California</strong>",25,3.0

The room was on the first floor facing the main street, therefore the noise was a little louder than I would like, especially when trying to sleep. The air conditioning was a little dated and loud, therefore I only used it to cool the room down and turned it off at night. Furthermore the furniture was also a little dated but functional.

Coming in on an early flight from Tokyo, we sincerely appreciated the hotel allowing us a very early check-in. Initially, we had reserved a ""kitchenette studio"" but it was too small for our party of three, which included a very active two year old who needed space to play in the room.We immediately asked to be upgraded to a one bedroom for the remainder of the stay, and Sunny Chen and the front desk staff were able to move us to a one-bedroom for an extra fee. The one-bedroom was definitely worth the extra cost, particularly since it was nice to have carpeting in the bedroom, but I will say that depending on the room, the quality of the sofa bed varied considerably. The big beds were fine in all of the rooms. Due to the season, the staff had to move us around a bit, staying in the studio for two or three nights, then a one-bedroom on the 2nd (?) floor for a week, then back to the 9th floor studio for two days, and finally to an *amazing* one-bedroom with an enormous and luxurious balcony on the 14th floor for the last few nights. It was so nice that we wanted to stay in the room and not go out.Moving from room to room during the stay was inconvenient since we had to check out and in each time-- and wait for the next room to become available-- but the front desk staff were accommodating and unfailingly polite each time we requested an item that we had used in the previous room but was not available in the next room, such as dishwashing soap, a colander, a small broom, etc. Traveling with a toddler, I appreciated the little touches that made the hotel more family friendly, such as toys for guests to borrow from the front desk, small fish that guests could ""adopt"" for a night, and especially the coffee service in the mornings. Though the hotel was friendly to families, most of the families we saw had older children, and we did not see all that many babies or toddlers. Excepting a loud party in a nearby room one night, which the staff addressed, the hotel was pretty quiet, and neither the street noise nor the air conditioner noise was as loud as other reviewers had mentioned.The location next to Fort DeRussy park was also fantastic, since we could go to the beach in the mornings and play in the park in the early evenings. We frequented the cafe outside the lobby, but it sounds like the cafe is no longer there as of this writing. That is a shame, since it was a nice little cafe and great for breakfast before heading out to the beach!All in all, despite housekeeping issues that were quickly resolved by the front desk staff, we had a great stay. Many thanks to Elton, Ona, and Ebony, especially.","Tokyo, Japan","toritsudaigaku</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",4,4.0

Mostly bad. Stayed here for 4 nights it was packaged into our trip from the Costco Trip package. We stayed in room 914.So let's get the good out of the way:+ Decent location. The beach is nearby and maybe a 5 minute walk. It's also close to the shops near the Royal Hawaiian.+ Free shuttle. The shuttle is trackable online and can be a way to travel around the city for free. E.g. from one Aqua hotel to the next aqua hotel.+ Happy hour on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 5-6pm. This means free wine and cheese on those days on the Mezzonine.+ They offer free DVD rentals. The DVD collection is pretty good. They had recent titles like focus. They had a playstation that would let you play DVD's+ They offer two Weber grills to grill from on the patio on the first floor.+ Full Kitchen and kitchen appliances: Small fridge, toaster, + Partial Ocean view is as advertised. Had a decent view of the city and the ocean.+ Bed / Pillow was comfortable and cleanSo the bad parts:- This place is dirty. They rarely ever cleaned the floors when i was there. I was a slob and ate coconut chips and accidentally dropped them on the floor the first night. They were there the whole time. If they're going to have tile floors they should sweep them. As if they had carpet, normally they should vacuum it. A/C units should be cleaned. I didn't want to check out the filter. It already had dust on the outside of the vents of the AC unit. The green sofa had a stain on it. It was brown.- The curtains were rusty as well and dusty. I didn't want to touch them. There's rust near the top of it.- The complimentary breakfast package includes breakfast across the street at the gateway hotel. The breakfast buffet at the gateway hotel was at a dive karaoke bar. They served the same food everyday. It was rather dingy and should have just remained a karaoke bar and not a breakfast buffet. Read the reviews for the gateway hotel. It's pretty nasty there.- The elevators were always usually dirty as well. I've seen sand and trash on the floor most of the day.- The AC is nice and didn't bother me. It's just annoying because the hallways, fitness and main areas were never cooled with AC. The fitness center did have two AC units; but they would cool it certain times of the day. - The microwave is rather difficult to use. It's the worst microwave i've ever used- The most frustrating part is they offer beach towel rental. They gave us two key cards seperate from the room cards. So what happens is you give them two cards like monopoly money and they give you two towels. This should mean one should know how many towels to keep on hand. However, this isn't the case. Frequently at times, they would run out of towels. When we did get said towels 30-40 minutes later they were the short bath towels you get in the room. What's the point of waiting for that? Beach towels should be longer than three feet. I have a large bottom. I need the towel so that sand doesn't go everywhere where the sun doesn't shine. You're a hotel by the Beach. You should make it a priority to get beach towels. - They offer yoga classes. We woke up early for them and the instructor didn't show up.- The shower head sprayed everywhere. It need to be cleaned and properly maintained. - Pool was really small and was hot.- Wifi was spotty- $15 resort fee per day was not worth it for free wine and cheese, missing towels, and movies.Some ok observations+/- The travel guy at the desk was busy watching youtube videos of videogames. +/- Front desk would disappear behind the office. Regardless, sometimes helpful and sometimes not. Sometimes wouldn't answer the phone after the 6th or 7th ring.+/- Lack of dining choices nearby. +/- Offer gym; gym lacked space, was hotOverall, it's ok but not some place i'd want to stay again. I'd rather save up money and stay at it's nearby competitors. The other reviewers are encouraged to write reviews by the hotel staff. Wouldn't trust them because they lack concrete details.","Plano, Texas","Chris L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Plano, Texas</strong>",7,1.0

So...fresh from the oven. Hotel location is excellent. Walking distance to the beach and prime shopping on Kalakaua Ave; and right across from an ABC store!! Check-in staff was courteous and helpful. The Expedia concierge at the lobby is helpful as well. You get to borrow beach towels, beach chairs and boards for free. Nice!!Now for the bad part : I am in a room with a kitchen. The house keeping does Not clean the kitchen!! Forget about the dishes, they don't even clean the kitchen counter or clear trash. Makes no sense. And their maintenance staff lack basic training in terms of courtesy. They walk in into an elevator with trash and cleaning carts when there are guests in the elevator. Has happened three times during my stay. These carts and trash stink and they don't understand that it is not a good practice to do that. And pls avoid the Pool and BBQ area at all costs. It's DIRTY like hell. And now for the Microwave. Pls enroll yourself into a PhD program at Berkeley or Stanford. You will need that to figure out how to work the microwave.

There was no courtesy call saying they ran out of roll away due to high occupancy. We had to call the Front Desk and they informed us that they ran out and there was nothing they could do.

She was so helpful, kind, and genuine. She always recognized us and did everything she could to make our stay comfortable and pleasant. Ryan made us feel right at home and put a smile on our faces with his hospitality and humor. The room was very clean, and we really enjoyed the small kitchenette. Our only suggestion would be to add a toaster. Our partial ocean view was beautiful. As we were on the 15th floor, we had a great view of the city, as well. The town is extremely congested and the traffic, at times, overwhelming; so the bikes (provided by the hotel) were extremely appreciated. My husband and I enjoyed many days and evenings riding the bikes around town and the beaches. Here's the catch and the only real disappointment we had were the high cost of parking and amenities fees. You'll pay an extra $50 each day of your stay to park and be able to use the Wi-Fi and bikes. There are also Yoga classes and a wine and cheese reception offered on certain days, free DVDs and Video Game Rentals, Ala Moana Shuttle, and a 10% discount at the Cafe Italia which serves breakfast in the hotel. There is access to the pool, fitness center, and BBQ grills on the 1st floor where you can also view the fireworks on Friday nights, which we weren't able to take advantage of, unfortunately. Breakdown: $35 parking and $15 amenities per day.I left a note for room service to leave extra coffee, creamer, and wash clothes each day, however, that never happened.

The kitchen was adequate for preparing meals, but the pans were well worn. We did find a dirty fork in the drawer upon arrival, but the rest looked very clean (I prewashed everything we used--no policy posted about hotel cleaning of dishes). Dish soap and new sponge provided along with dish rack, towels and potholder. I did have to request that the floor be swept and it was done the same day. The bed was very comfortable!! Shower head needed replacing but worked well enough to get by. Breakfast was good in the cafe next to the lobby. Just a little slow taking our order. Beach towels and chairs were provided at front desk. Nice pool area. Shopping and restaurants within easy walking distance. Parking is expensive. Consider using local transportation and shuttles for getting around. Concierge was very helpful scheduling tours. Construction is being done on one side close to hotel which may cause a slightly longer walk depending on where you are going. Seems like Waikiki is always under construction!!

We had a third floor room overlooking the King Kalakaua Plaza. The two queen size beds were comfortable with plenty of pillows and the room was well equiped and well maintained. Kalakaua Avenue is a busy street, so there was some street noise, particularly early in the morning when the garbage bins were emptied. If you're noise sensitive you might want to ask for a higher floor or a room on the ocean side but the noise was really not a major problem for us. We stayed a week so the laundry room on the main floor was handy to have, as was the ABC store just across the street and the convenience store in the gas station next door.The pool is small but with Waikiki beach so close it also doesn't seem to get used a lot. The sun deck is quiet and kept immaculate as is the lobby and lounge area on the mezzanine where the manager hosts a wine and cheese reception on Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings (both the Merlot and the Chardonnay were very nice).Ours was not one of the kitchenette units but it did have a sizable counter space, kitchen sink, mini fridge and coffee maker.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We had a one-bedroom suite with a kitchenette. Our balcony overlooked the nearby park and the beach just beyond. Although the hotel is located on a busy thoroughfare and this could make it a little noisy on the balcony, it's located far enough away from other tall buildings so you can get nice views of the surrounding area instead of just views of buildings next door. We were just a few minutes' walk from Fort DeRussy beach which we found to be wider and less crowded than other beaches in the area. The hotel offers a shuttle that can take you to other parts of Waikiki. We availed of that service on a couple of occasions. It's a great way to become more familiar with the area and the drivers, like the hotel staff, were helpful and friendly. Our room was very comfortable. We had loads of closet space and the kitchenette was well equipped and allowed us to cook several of our own meals instead of having to rely too much on restaurant food.We enjoyed the pool deck and availed of the BBQs, which were always very clean. They offer yoga on the pool deck a few mornings a week so I took advantage of that on one occasion and enjoyed that as well.The only issues we had during our stay was that some items were not always replenished every day. We used our coffee maker daily but had to go down to the lobby in search for sugar a couple of times because the housekeeping staff had not left any. We also came very close to running short of toilet paper and tissues one day. It was just a matter of going out to the hall and asking the obliging housekeeping staff to provide some, but we shouldn't have to track down essentials like that. As mentioned above, the noise from the street was a bit much at times, but it wouldn't keep me from going back to the hotel because the location is great. There was supposed to be WiFi in the room. I couldn't get it to work (may have been a problem with me and not the WiFi) but that was not a big deal either because there was internet access in the lobby and I availed of that from time to time.

Also the pool on the 1st floor of the hotel approx. 300 metres away was noisy when revellers were in the pool.

It definitely wasn't bad, but there are areas for improvement. It was purchased as a Hotwire Secret Hotel deal, so I didn't know what it was before I booked it. The not so good things... the balcony in my room was filthy. Clearly it doesn't get cleaned very often, it was covered in cigarette butts and bird poo. The sunshade didn't secure properly either. The room itself was clean enough, but the rooms look a bit dated and the furnishings a bit tacky. There is a resort fee of $15 a day... I suspect they charge this because everyone else does in Waikiki. Albeit, it does come with some benefits but they are negligible. For example, the ""managers reception"" (with cheese and wine), the yoga and DVD rental.. I'd rather just pay for that if I wanted it, and have a reduced ""resort fee"". The wifi is also included in the resort fee... it was rather patchy at times and didn't always work. If you're going to charge for it, at least make sure it's reliable. Also included in the fee is the ""in room coffee"" and access to the gym... come on, most hotels have that for free!The staff were all friendly and polite, so that was a good thing. Would I return?

The balcony had a table and two chairs, perfect for breakfast outside!I liked that the hotel was set back from the beach a little bit with the park in between. The rooms were nicely decorated, and the kitchenette came in handy.I didn't take advantage of many resort items except for the wine receptions (friendly service!), water in the lobby, beach towels, and the fitness room. The fitness room had an elliptical machine, two treadmills, an exercise bike, and a bunch of weight machines. The wireless internet took a little bit of fiddling to get working on my phone, but it was functional enough once that was fixed.The front desk was always helpful with everything I asked, and the valet was prompt and courteous. There is an ABC Store across the street with any minor groceries you need. The main shopping areas are a few blocks away, but it's a nice walk if you can do it.The only complaint I would have was that the elevators were unusually slow and seemed to be following a very strange algorithm.

The hotel does a wine & cheese reception three nights a week on the mezzanine level. Awesome!As the hotel is right in the middle of Waikiki, parking is an issue.

We were able to rent a new Volvo from the hotel for $127/day. This price covered everything, including insurance and parking. The front desk staff handles the rentals so it is charged to your room. This is a good deal when compared to the prices at other car rental agencies in Waikiki.Café Italia is a new restaurant at the hotel and is located right outside of the lobby.

I was in town primarily because of the Hapalua Half Marathon and I wanted a hotel that was relatively affordable and reasonably close to the start line of the race on Waikiki Beach. I also was looking for a hotel with a kitchenette as I wanted the option of making some of my meals. The Luana met those needs. I would give it a 3.5 stars if Trip Advisor had the option.Pros:--Rooms with kitchenette and a separate dining/seating area--Eight to 10 minute walk to Waikiki Beach--Reasonable value for money in what is an expensive cityCons:--Air conditioner unit in the room is noisy (we had to switch rooms to another room to get a newer, quieter unit(--Mandatory resort fee of $15/day--Hotel is not directly on the beach so if you are planning to go to the beach frequently, keep this in mindThe staff were helpful when we needed anything though I would not say they were overly hospitable (i.e. nobody asked us how our stay was at check out etc).The biggest warning I have is that if you were expecting an ocean front location then this is not the place to consider as you do have to walk about 10 minutes to access the beach.

This hotel is nice. We had a partial ocean view, which was great - across Fort DeRussy Park to the beach. We also had a view onto Kalakaua Avenue, which was nice at night. The room itself was a decent size. We asked for two queen beds and received those. The room also had a mini-fridge and a microwave, plus plates, silverware and glasses, all of which we used during our stay.The Luana is in a decent location. The walk to the beach takes only a few minutes, and a short walk down Kalakaua will get you to any number of shopping and dining locations. It's also a pretty short drive to the Ala Moana mall, and fairly easy to get onto the H1. Service was great - everyone was really friendly, helpful and attentive. There is a resort fee per night, but we used the amenities (towels and chairs for the beach, DVD and game rentals) and I found it reasonable.My only real complaints are minor. First, if you park here, the only option is valet, even though the parking garage is located on property. I resented not being able to park my own car and being charged one of the highest nightly rates in the city for the privilege of having someone else do it. Second, there isn't a restaurant at this hotel. As I mentioned, there are a number of restaurants within walking distance, but sometimes you just want to order room service for convenience and that wasn't possible. Third, the air conditioning was really loud. We ended up opening the lanai doors in the mornings and evenings as much as possible and used it only in the afternoons or at night if the room got hot. It was annoyingly loud while trying to get to sleep, but we did sleep soundly once we managed to fall asleep.Overall, though, my family enjoyed its stay at the Luana Waikiki and we would consider staying here again.",chicago,"Jadedmind</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>chicago</strong>",36,4.0

Many thanks to Elton who assisted us greatly after we realised at the airport that we had left our keys in the safe!My only gripe is with the resort fee which a lot of hotels in Waikiki seem to be charging now. Firstly it's a hotel not a resort and there is a difference. Secondly many of the items "" included"" in the fee are standard inclusions in most hotels I've ever stayed in and the other items are things I would never use. It seems as though hotels advertise a cheaper rate and then sneak in a resort fee to make up the difference. Some hotels in Waikiki charge a resort fee, some don't so whilst I really liked the Luana next time I'd choose the hotel that doesn't.

The key thing that can be improved is the parking which is valet only. I would prefer self-park with a faster in and out. I also had a lower floor room fronting the busy Kalakaua street. There was no escape from the loud bike muffler noise lasting into late hours. We managed to counter it with white noise by turning up the AC fan. For light sleepers, get the ocean view rooms or at least requesting higher floors.The hotel is located on the north end of the Waikiki and a bit more farther away from the beach or the center of Waikiki frenzy.

They even offered yoga and bike rentals. The staff was terrific, and went out of their way to make us feel so welcome and at home. Matthew, at the activity desk, he helped me bring 3 coffees to my room, I was not sure how to get all 3 cups up, and he found quick solution with a smile.The day we were going snorkelling at Hanama Bay, he offered us snorkel gear(helped save rental costs).The lovely lady( sorry did not get your name), who invited us to the wine and cheese party, we just came from the beach. She served us our wine , thank you. Then both Mathew and Tyler convinced me to try zip lining at Koaloa Ranch. Tyler arranged for my mom to come for the ride to the ranch, again with a smile. It was one of the best afternoons and most fun you can have while in Honolulu(try a burger afterwards at the restaurant). The hotel,was clean, our rooms spacious. Great location, easy walk to the beach and lovely park where you can start your day, with a complimentary coffee served daily in the lobby. You can catch local buses and tour buses right across the street, very convenient. I don't often write reviews, but really had to write how impressed I was with your hotel and great staff. Finally a big thank you to the gentleman that helped us get our taxi on 26th feb, back to the airport.

We took a one day Staycation (vacation spent at home) because it is Prom season and our son had their Prom at the nearby Hale Koa Hotel. Because of traffic and parking in Waikiki we did not want to have to fight either on the night of the big dance, so we decided to book a stay at the Luana. What an experience! I called the hotel the morning of our arrival and asked if we were able to check-in early. Jordan answered and stated that it was fine to come early as we could spend time in the pool and our bags could be held in the bellhop room until our bags were ready. It was a beautiful day and our daughters were eager to get into the pool, which is heated and perfectly sized for their swimming needs. Adam was the valet that took our car and insured us that we had in/out privileges any time of day and full access to our car throughout the day. The whole staff was very helpful and friendly no matter time of day. We were able to get into the pool while we were waiting for our room. Another plus was the fact that the fitness center is located next to the pool so that my wife and I were able to exercise and keep an eye on our kids at the same time as they frolicked in the pool.Time to check-in and I went to the front desk to request that our room had two queens rather than a single king in the category I booked... one bedroom suite with kitchen. I was informed that everything was taken care of and instead of the the one bedroom suite, we were upgraded to the two bedroom suite with two full baths and kitchen. What a surprise and impression that was made for my entire family. My son and his girlfriend were able to prep for their Prom in the spacious room, We were able to take amazing pictures of everyone on the private balcony. The beds were very clean and comfortable. The resort fee offered many extras that was an added value to our stay... unlimited free DVD and game rental, free daily paper, free shuttle, and others.Overall, an amazing staycation with perfect weather. Even though we only stayed one night, I can guarantee that we will be back! Thank you for an opportunity to make lasting memories with my Ohana....family.Mahalo!

The hotel is right on the main drag. This means that no matter the floor, bottom or top, you are going to deal with some serious road noise. If you're unlucky enough to be on the actual highway side, bring earplugs and gird yourself for the constant traffic noise. The rooms themselves are just fine. That's the best I can really offer. Think 1980s chic. Tile floors, older linens, older everything. While all of that is manageable, what was the deal sealer for us was the AC unit. It's one of those through-the-wall types that cuts on and off LOUDLY all night. The AC noise might cover the road noise but only until the clunk-clunk compressor goes off, then you're back to road noise (and being awake).We stayed just one night of our 14 night stay there and then transferred to the Aqua Iliki, a sister hotel just down the road. Same price, and much much much nicer. Things to know:1. Kitchenettes: Some rooms have them. 2. One King or two Queens: Unfortunately sometimes the second queen is a fold out and you can't get the preferred room types with a kitchenette.3. The hotel is also a condo, which means lots of little kids running up and down the halls.4. Loud doors: The old-fashioned kind that close/slam loudly. 5. Hotel lobby: Nicely furnished with nice folks, but it's loud too. Feels more like a Holiday Inn Express than a nicer hotel. Final Word: If you are going without kids or value silence, go elsewhere.

Our room was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for cooking our own meals, which is a big plus if you have a big family and want to save some bread. Comfortable beds all the way around, including the sleeper sofa, two full bathrooms and enough room for our family to unwind and not feel cramped.

The hotel is now an Aqua property (on my previous visit it was an Outrigger).This hotel is in a fabulous and unique location - it is worth consulting a map before staying here. The address is on Kalakaua Ave, yet the hotel is surrounded by Fort Derussy Park, making for a peaceful and scenic stroll to the beach. An early morning walk is a vacation mainstay for us, so it was great to start our daily walks surrounded by greenery versus the concrete jungle of Waikiki.The hotel was built in 1971 but underwent a major facelift about 10 years ago. The design choices were classic, so the property doesn't seem dated. The lobby is cozy and inviting. We loved the fresh water station, which also includes coffee/tea in the morning. The hotel has a pleasant pool area a couple of floors above the street, facing the back of the property. There is a small gym in that area, as well as a couple of barbecues with tables overlooking the park. While I envisioned ourselves grilling some fresh fish and eating dinner there, with all of the great restaurant options in the area, that didn't materialize.We had a partial ocean view studio, facing East. From our lanai we had an expansive view of Waikiki, the park and the ocean. Based on disappointing past stays in hotels that face busy streets in Waikiki, I would personally only go for a partial or ocean view unit at this hotel. There was some noise when sitting on the lanai (to be expected in the heart of the city), but when the door was closed the room was whisper quiet and we always slept well. The little kitchenette was perfect for our needs, as the only meal we tend to eat in when in Waikiki is breakfast (yogurt, granola, tropical fruit). The staff at the hotel stood out. They were always polite and accommodating. The hotel hosts a weekly wine and cheese reception on Friday afternoons. Attending that event gave us the opportunity to meet the hotel manager and other staff members, who were friendly and professional.On a couple of occasions we signed out hotel bicycles, once to ride around Waikiki on beach cruiser bicycles, and a second time to ride in a quieter area of the island (on this day we took the folding bicycles in our rental car). Lots of fun. This hotel does not offer room service, which was fine by us. There is a small cafe just off the lobby, and plenty of other eating options within walking distance.Note that parking is expensive, and is only valet, as is typical for many Waikiki hotels. We opted to park at an off-site location.In summary, we loved our stay and wouldn't hesitate to come here again. It offers good value, a great location, and plenty of ""aloha"" spirit.","North Vancouver, Canada","kayteeYVR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Vancouver, Canada</strong>",274,5.0

You can bring down whatever you need to warm up at front desk though (a little inconvenient if you needed to warm up milk for the little ones) but not a big deal. Plenty of coffee shops around. Luana is located at the beginning of the strip, I prefer to be in the middle. I was travelling with my family, (kids 3&4) this hotel is great for couples, or if you're traveling alone.

The location makes it easy to walk to the beach and most of the attractions of downtown Waikiki. There is a shuttle to the Ala Moana Mall. With Fort De Russey park in the back, there is an excellent green space to make the location even more inviting. The main street is a very busy street but the noise level is not too annoying.Staff here are excellent and very customer service oriented. Almost all were very helpful and courteous. Jackie at the front desk went above and beyond in giving us a late checkout to our room. James in valet is also excellent. We do not rent a vehicle when we stay here but we do use the beach amenities provided by the hotel (beach chairs, bikes). James is excellent in providing those. House keeping is very good and those providing the services are extremely friendly and courteous.The rooms are nice, seem roomy and well appointed. We have always stayed in a studio which comes with a large granite topped counter, sink, full compliment of dishes/utensils, etc. A microwave oven can be obtained from the front desk at no additional charge. Bathroom has a combination tub/shower and is okay. The hotel has a laundry room with about 5 washers and 6 dryers. Very convenient. The pool area is not large, but is very well maintained and a wonderful place to go when wanting to relax. A BBQ area with 2 very nice grills and 3 high topped tables is adjacent to the pool and is great for an occasional home cooked steak dinner!We often stay here for an extended time, 3-4 weeks, and this hotel almost seems like home away from home. A GREAT place to stay! OH, they had a wine and cheese party for guests from 4-5 pm on each Friday on our recent stay. It was EXCELLENT! Great cheese, some good wine, and a chance to socialize and meet some of the hotel guests. It was a much better experience than expected!

I was expecting at least a counter clean off and vacuum as well. Other negatives include annoying elevators, internet goes in and out, and smallish pool.

The beds are queen sized, not double, and the sheets are spotless and comfortable. The beds are extremely comfortable. Plenty of pillows, plus extras in the cupboard. Our room overlooks the park between the hotel and the beach. It's just beautiful. Can't think of a thing to whinge about!! While the $15 a day amenity charge was not booked to our room, we paid it because you get a free shuttle service, and free rental movies. Haven't used the gym yet, but the machines are good quality. Pool is clean. Would definately recommend, and yes would definately stay here again. Just a block from the beach, and big shopping plaza a block to the right.

Picked the Luana Waikiki. Decent hotel about 2 blocks from the beach. Parking is valet only and is $35 a day. A queen bed and a fold out couch with a kitchenette. Just right for a long weekend. The hotel staff was very courteous, knowledgeable, and helpful. We had a few problems with the room: a roof safe that wouldn't lock, the deadbolt on the glass patio door was broken, and the AC didn't work the last night we were there. The hotel staff said they could send someone right up, but we were leaving for the day and they didn't want maintenance in our room if the safe was broken. They didn't provide dish soap or dish towels for the kitchen. They have a very small pool, but we didn't plan on using it anyway since we had plans that took up the whole weekend. Honolulu traffic is the worst so having a good GPS to get us to the Hotel and around town was a must.

I am a person who puts in loads of hours researching hotels, reading reviews on every booking website, comparing prices, street viewing the area because i seriously believe that where you stay can help make or horribly break a vacation...the Luana Hotel, its facilities and staff helped MAKE our vacation.Room tips: Try get a high floor above 5th floor - my parents were on the 9th floor, my brother and his wife on the 10th, my wife and I on the 12th (we stayed seperate floors by choice hotel staff asked us if we wanted to stay near eachother but we declined) aside from the odd Harley motorcycle and random fire engine or ambulance that youd hear no matter where you stayed in Waikiki there wasnt much steet noise! Although Cityview rooms are facing the street so i suspect it would be something to be wary if on lower levelsAircon can be noisy if you dont like noise but nice and cool.One thing id suggest to be very wary of is donot have small children on the balconies the gaps in the upright rails were big enough for my 2yo daughter to slip through *shudder* we kept the door closed- i have informed the hotel of my concern.The room we stayed in was 1215 Partial ocean view which was outstanding (go for this room) awesome views!",Wollongong,"Stoksie30</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wollongong</strong>",5,5.0

Upon opening the door to our room, the spacious surprise behind the door lured me inside to explore.  The large radiate tile floors expanded the entire room. The granite countertop and cabinets, extended for miles.  The room had a nice comfortable mattress, couch and chairs!  The sliding glass door, opened to reveal a lanai which held two chairs and a small table. It was the perfect spot to unwind and watch all of Waikiki unfold day and night.  No ocean or major mountain views.  We had the city (with lights at night!) and peek-a-boo mountain views.  Our lanai overlooked where Kuhio and Kalakaua Avenue fork, with lots of traffic, sirens and the occasional loud moped. However, at the fork in the streets, sat a small park with sidewalks, resembling a labyrinth, which ended at a water feature. Watching humanity below was entertaining.   Every day you could indulge for a cool refreshing, exotic beverage of H20 after walking around and melting in the warm Waikiki sun, provided by the hotel in the lobby area.  The detoxing water options were lemon & basil or lemon & cucumber.  Personally, the lemon and basil was perfect! The workout room is equally nice as it looks out onto the pool deck and pool. Easy walking distance to many shops and restaurants and the beach! While waiting on my partner to settle the room charges & daily parking with Saori (who was very nice, professional, helpful and courteous), at the front desk, I noticed a small fish bowl sitting on the reception desk counter.  The sign next to the glass bowl read, “Adopt Mumu & Lulu for the day!”  This hotel offers the comfort of home, even adopting a pet fish for the day.","Kihei, Hawaii","sail4778</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kihei, Hawaii</strong>",6,5.0

We could easily walk to shops and restaurants. It's next to Fort DeRussey Park and paved walkways through the park take you to the beach in 10 minutes. Our primary purpose in Honolulu was to visit the Pearl Harbor Memorial. From the Luana, we walked to the bus stop on Saratoga Ave (5 minutes) and caught bus 42 which has a stop right at the memorial (so does bus 20). It took about an hour to get there with all the stops, but it was easy - and affordable at $2.50 per person.

I have read some negative reviews but thus far can only agree with a couple of them.Yes the hotel is aging a little, however, I like it. It is clean and comfortable and above all the staff are amazing. Yes the lifts can be a little irritating as they are slow. The airconditioners are noisier than I'm used to but I didn't find it an issue at all.What does it lack - I would have liked a bar in the hotel for evening drinks, but you cross the road and there you are - a bar.The staff cannot do enough for you - just ask and they go out of their way to assist, even the night security guards go above and beyond.Ryan the 'bell boy' is the most amazing, friendly person you could meet - he even took the time to tune our Ukelele and I never saw him without a smile on his face. Matteo also is happy to help you with anything you want. Matthew and Tyler the concierge staff will help you with anything and always with a smile. All the reception staff are polite and smiling and the most helpful people you could wish for. One in particular - Elton went out of his way to assist us when we wanted pizza delivered and had a great sense of humour, displayed when we gave him ""Aussie grief"".Any negatives you can find about this hotel are put aside due to the attitude and pleasantness of the staff.Would I stay here again.....Heck yes.","Melbourne, Australia","POM1272</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",25,5.0

We arrived at the hotel around 9:30 in the morning fully expecting that we would have to store our luggage and kill time until our check-in time of 4:00 pm. We were delighted to be informed that our room was available immediately. It started our stay on a very positive note.We had chosen a partial ocean view studio with a kitchenette. The room was lovely and the view was amazing! Our room was located on the 11th floor and overlooked Fort DeRussey Park and the ocean. We appreciated the vintage Hawaii decor and found the room included everything we needed to be comfortable. It was extremely clean and very well equipped.The location is at the gateway into Waikiki and within walking distance to the beach as well as all of the shops and restaurants in Waikiki. There is also great access to public transportation and shuttles. A car is not really necessary unless you plan to travel outside of the Waikiki area. The hotel itself is a real gem! We have been travelling to Waikiki almost every year since our honeymoon in 1978. We have stayed at several different large hotel properties and also rented private condominiums for longer stays. I have to say that this is one of the most pleasant properties we have stayed at.If you can look past the slighted dated facade, you will find a lovely little hotel that is reminiscent of the Hawaii of days past. Rather than trying to modernize the decor, they have embraced the vintage Hawaii feel and the result is a warm and inviting home away from home. The lobby area is very comfortable and nicely decorated.They have included special touches such as cold water dispensers with cucumbers and mint flavouring to welcome you when you come in out of the heat. It is so refreshing and we took advantage of it each time we returned to the hotel. They also had a sunscreen dispenser mounted on a wall by the pool. I have never seen this before, even in a high end resort. What a wonderful idea! We were also very pleased to be offered ice pops out by the pool one afternoon to cool us off. Little touches like these make moments memorable and leave a lasting impression.The staff members were all so friendly and eager to please! We were always greeted with a smile and friendly word when we approached any of them. They worked diligently every day keeping the hotel immaculate for their guests. A wine and cheese social is held every Friday afternoon from 4:00 to 5:00 pm and it is a wonderful way to meet and visit with other hotel guests.It is difficult to find anything negative to say about this property. The only thing I could suggest is that they look at replacing the air conditioning units in the rooms as we did find ours to be quite noisy. It did the job to keep the room cool though. We also had the patio doors open most of the time anyway so it was only an issue when we turned the air conditioning on.We will definitely stay at this hotel again, and if you are looking to visit Waikiki in the near future, you may want to consider it for your stay. I am sure you will not be disappointed!","Edmonton, Canada","BrendaSch2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",8,5.0

The pool and workout facility are good and the service exceptional! The valet parking was convenient but a bit on the expensive side $35 a night but they are available for in and out privileges 24 hours!

They were very clean and comfortable, well equipped with lovely furnishings, and a great view across the park to the ocean. We found the housekeeping staff very pleasant and thorough.Front desk staff were always willing to offer travel, direction and local restaurant tips, and the complimentary beach towel service was a bonus. A big thank you to the concierge Tyler, who assisted us in local info, and booking tours.We thought the location was excellent.. just far enough out of the central Waikiki commotion, yet close enough to enjoy all that Waikiki has to offer. We enjoyed the 5-10 min walk to both the beach (through the park), and the main shopping precinct ( A good way to work off excess food and cocktail calories :)). And there's always the trusty ABC shop across the road.The cafe downstairs is open for breakfast and lunch, and offers tasty fare at a good price.It was very hot while we were there (even by Hawaiian standards), so we loved being able to walk into the front lobby and have complimentary icy lemon/mint water on tap. Also used the lobby complimentary tea/coffee service in the mornings.The only problems we had during our stay, were, the pool was closed for a couple of days due to a water quality issue, and the airconditioner stopped working one night.. Both were rectified quickly and caused us little inconvenience.As you can see by my review, loved, loved our stay there and would head back tomorrow!Many thanks to all the staff :)",,jelise2014,4,5.0

Check in took 30 mins because all the guests were upset they couldn't get the room that they reserved. Also the front desk was unable to tell the guests if their room was ready because they said housecleaning has not communicated with them all day. The air conditioner is louder than the tv and barely provided any coolness to the room. When we tried playing dvds, the movies would oftem just stop or skip.

The room was 16th and 14th floor and had a view of the park and ocean.Very very nice.I would recommend to book a room with at least partial ocean view and request a higher floor.With that kind of view in Waikiki, I think price of the room is a big bargain.The bed was very comfortable,even the hotel room has small kitchenette and basic plates and utensils.They don't have a formal restaurant but there is a small cafe open from 0700-1400, which we went twice.We didn't have time to wait in the long lineup at Eggs'things( which is very close from hotel) and we were all happy to have breakfast crepe and acai bowl at this small cafe.Don' t expect 5 star facility (no room service,pool was broken at the time,elevator takes time) but you can expect 5 star service.Front lady called ABC store for us to find out if they carry what we were looking for, she was very friendly and had a good smile at 11pm.Asked for an extra towel for house keeping(it was an answering machine maybe because late at night) Towel never arrived so talked to the front desk and she send someone right away, and he was a security guy.I talked to him earlier in elevator he was a very nice guy with smile.I gave him a tip for the towel but he declined with smile.

The changeover seems to have been seamless, and our week's stay was just as enjoyable as the previous visit.The courteous and friendly staff enhance the holiday experience, and the location, overlooking the park and the ocean, and at the quieter end of the Waikiki strip is a winner. The view from a partial ocean view room is far more rewarding than what's on offer from nearby prestigious hotels at double the price.The pool area is pleasant and wind-protected, with plenty of sun lounges and shade if required, and a perfect place to watch the Friday Night Fireworks. Nice change for a hotel pool not to be bombarded with chlorine, but maintained at a comfortable level. The complementary local newspaper and free morning tea/coffee in the lobby provide a very relaxing atmosphere to start each day, and the proximity to many restaurants and public transport makes eating and local travel a breeze. Just a 5-minute walk to the centre of the Waikiki strip, and maybe 20 minutes to Ala Moana if you prefer a walk to a bus ride ($2.50). Further afield, the bus can get you very cheaply to the Aloha Stadium, Pearl Harbour, Waikele Factory Outlets, and Pearlridge Shopping Mall - all $2.50 unless you break the journey. The bus is a lot slower than your own transport, but many times cheaper than the shuttle tours you will be subjected to from the moment you arrive.I am often puzzled by some of the petty or nit-picking observations in reviews such as these, but we really couldn't fault anything about our stay, which offered value, location and friendly staff. All of these enabled our objective of a week's relaxation to be easily accomplished, and easily determined our choice for a return visit.If I had to pick out a negative, I'd have to mention that $35 a day for parking is a bit steep, and certainly over the odds for hotels in the area, but the valet staff were pleasant, knowledgable and super quick. Leave yourself some time to sit and people-watch in the comfortable rocking chairs at the front of the hotel","Melbourne, Australia","robtup</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",17,5.0

We have stayed in the middle of the action in Waikiki many times but I enjoyed the quiet location of Luana better. Check in was a breeze. Though not easily seen, there is a ramp on the other side of the driveway for dragging up heavy bags which takes you right into the lobby. We were greeted by a young man with a beautiful smile and check in was quick and easy. Our room had a queen bed and sofa bed (which was actually comfortable) and fully equipped kitchen complete with plates, cups, glasses, flatware, pots, pans, utensils, toaster, coffee maker, microwave, 2 burner cooktop and small refrigerator. There was plenty of storage for clothing with 4 deep under bed drawers and a large armoire. There was a nice deep safe inside the armoire. Though small, the bathroom was adequate, however, the design of the door was a bit odd. A pocket door would have worked much better. We discovered we had an odd plumbing issue when we noticed water on the bathroom floor. A trip the the front desk for extra towels and a service request was quickly handled. Within minutes, a friendly maintenance man was fixing the issue with the pipe under the sink. Housekeeping was very good and kept our room very clean. The air conditioning was a bit loud but we got used to it and it kept the room comfortable. Although we didn't have a car, the valets would always greet us and talk to us when we were coming or going. The beach was a nice leisurely walk through beautiful Ft Derussy Park and it was nice to have beach chairs, umbrellas, rafts, water noodles, other beach toys free to take with us supplied by the bell desk. We did use the pool area one morning and it is a very tranquil setting with very nice padded towel draped lounge chairs. Though we did not use it, the gym was by the pool and a bar-b-q area was also available pool side. Again we did not use this, but there were laundry facilities available. The location of Luana Waikiki makes it easy to walk to Ala Moana mall, The Beachwalk, the Royal Hawaiian shopping center and restaurants popular in the area. There is a bus stop next to the post office which is a block away. But the quiet location of the Luana made it nice to come back to after the hustle and bustle of the more popular touristy areas along Waikiki Beach. Protea Cafe, on property, had the best muffins and fruit bowls for breakfast and delicious sandwiches and savory crepes. There were other items on the menu we would have tried but did not. The staff at Protea is very friendly and it was fun talking to them. Their prices are low for Honolulu so a very good value. All in all, the Luana Waikiki is a great location with friendly staff and comfortable rooms. I would not hesitate to stay here again in the future.",san antonio,"fijisunsets</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>san antonio</strong>",30,5.0

Only drawback was that the only bathroom was in the bedroom, other than that found the room (606 or 607…can't remember) to be spotlessly clean and well stocked w/ a full kitchen…great for keeping dinner leftovers to reheat for breakfast the next morning! Nice, quiet location overlooking Fort De Russy w/ views of the ocean a few blocks away, quick 10 minute walk or drive to waikiki beaches and shopping, the zoo, honolulu museum of art & Ala Moana shopping. Gas station right next door for filling up on the way to return the rental car. Small cafe downstairs right off the lobby for grabbing breakfast to go and coffee was just fine and reasonably priced w/ friendly staff. My son appreciated the lender toys & even pet fish to borrow for the stay. Every staff member we interacted with from valet to front desk to housekeeping was exceedingly friendly & genuine. We did not use the pool but it appeared clean and well maintained. The property is an Aqua property, meaning it's decor has a nice fusion of hawaiiana (including a genuine old Woody out in the parking lot) & contemporary...look for Kamaaina rates if traveling from your home island, other discounts were available as well.

The hotel is very well maintained, and clean. We had a studio kitchenette partial ocean view. You are far enough away from the ocean that I would not spend the extra dollars for the full ocean view. I actually like to cook while I am on vacation. I specifically like making breakfast so there is no rush to the morning. The kitchenette had everything we needed. I cooked every morning and then a few night when we were exhausted from touring all day. They provide you with coffee for the coffee pot every day. Dish washing liquid, salt and pepper which is very nice. Having the grilling area is a real plus as well if you want to cook. The fitness center was excellent with lots of different equipment. Maybe because we were in Hawaii, but I was never in competition for any of the equipment. The pool was pretty small, but the beach was within a 5 minute walk, so it didn't seem to be a problem. The hotel as has chairs, beach towels, snorkel equipment and other beach items that you can borrow for the day. All you have to do is give them your room number. This was very helpful.There is also a laundry it you are there long enough and need to wash clothes. The beds were comfortable, however, we did not have a King bed, which we normally prefer. However, we both slept very well. The room also darkened very nicely, which is a big issue for me if it doesn't. The elevators were slow and in the mornings you could not get to the pool to just sit out side to read until 9a. We came from the east coast of the USA and being on Eastern time, it would have been nice to be able to get out by the pool even if I couldn't get in. You do have to pay for parking. It is Valet and there are no other options. I would have preferred to have parked my own car. There is a $15.00 per day Hospitality Fee. I assume covers all the use of beach equipment, chairs, towels, etc. Every person we encountered was extremely nice and very helpful. This hotel is in a very nice area, lots of shopping, restaurants, park and close to the beach. I would definitely stay here again.","King, North Carolina","Robin V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>King, North Carolina</strong>",51,4.0

Ryan is an authentic looking Hawaiian dude, with a wide grin and a very hospitable personality with very helpful advice. Gavin was the other bellhop,had quite disposition but with a warm smile. My favorite was the valet Abraham, he had a surfer dude air about him, but he had the uncanny ability to make you feel special. IF he did this for ordinary me I am sure this was just who he is. All the staff was personable, if you were on the elevator with the hotel staff you were greeted warmly. The facility amenities included beach chairs which beat renting any day, wish they had umbrellas too. The refreshing water in the lobby is something I looked forward to after my daily island explorations. The pool was a little small but the water was fabulous,they didn't overdue the chemicals. The grill is wonderful feature, however, there were lines to get to that bad boy, if you want to take advantage of this amenity start early. The room was nice overlooking the park.

The one-bedroom set-up was exactly what we needed with new-looking appliances including two TV's, a full refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, and range. There were plenty of plates, silverware, glasses and such for our daily use. The king bed was very comfortable and while the sofabed probably wouldn't have worked for the adults, it was fine for a 12-year old.The hotel staff were very friendly and attentive. The housekeeping was wonderful and patient with all the sand we tracked into the room and tub!! The pool was small but very clean and beautiful...it was a good option when we didn't want to go to the nearby beach. The deck was attractive and they have BBQ grills available. The lobby and mezzanine are relaxing and nice. They even have bikes, beach chairs, and a fishbowl you can borrow! The place is family friendly and the staff were warm toward our kids.The location was great for us--fairly close to the beach through the beautiful park and close to convenience stores, shopping, the Waikiki Beach area, food, and the shuttle stop across the street. When it was hot, it was a bit of a drag to walk to the beach but we actually were quite happy not to have stayed in the busiest part of Waikiki. The views were beautiful from our room and the park is lovely to look at and stroll through. We could even see fireworks from our room two separate nights.The newly opened cafe (Protea Cafe) is small but the staff are welcoming and generous with the portions. They greeted us warmly every day and the food was tasty. They even made a custom grilled cheese for our preschooler. They could skimp on the food portions and make more money! We wish them success with the cafe.One down side is that the concierge service is out-sourced to Expedia and so we didn't find the same kind of attentiveness or care you can get with hotel concierges. Because they are there to sell timeshares, you wonder whether they really are trying to give you the best deal or the best travel advice.

The lobby was clean and inviting, with complimentary coffee in the mornings. The room however, not too clean. Though the kitchenette was very spacious with tons of storage (but no microwave?), the bathroom and shower space were very tight. There was still old food inside the small refrigerator.. ick. The beds were ok comfy though not the best thread count for sheets. There was no closet, but an old fashioned wardrobe that was 8"" too short for the length of my maxi dresses (and I'm 5'3""). It was a little dusty on the inside so I minded my dresses dragging on the bottom. Additionally, there was only a dented mini ironing board to try to iron the wrinkles out. At the end of the week, my clothes smelled like the old wardrobe. There was a small table for dining, no desk/work area. Walls are thin so when there are kids running and screaming in the late night, you hear it. The bathroom has no ventilation and becomes easily heated with the door closed. The rooms need an update to match their lobby and pool area. The construction next door (drilling cement) wasn't the greatest to listen to at 10:00pm on a weekday. Went to the Protea cafe- we weren't greeted, the food was too salty, the service was awful. We had to get their attention first each time and then ask for everything- utensils, napkins, another cup of coffee, the check. Tried out the Cheeseburger in Paradise around the corner- this is the place to go for a great breakfast with great service at a great price! The Luana is a three star hotel, value was ok for being mid summer, parking though is outrageous at $35 day.

It's very new, very clean, and the staff is very friendly. Our room had a mini-fridge, a sink and some dining wear (plates, bowls, cups) but nothing to heat the food with. We called the front desk and they brought us a microwave, which came in really useful since we stayed for slightly more than a week. We barely used the pool and didn't use the fitness center so I can't comment on that. However, they do provide beach towels and chair which is super-helpful (I don't know if that's an industry practice in Hawai'i, but it's nice). They do have cars for rent onsite, but they are more expensive than renting at the airport (even including the $35/day parking charge), but less expensive than renting from the agencies in-town. We rented a car for a couple of days from the airport and paid for parking at the hotel.

The staff at the check in desk were very friendly and welcoming at check in and throughout the stay. We had an ocean view one bedroom suite and the view was stunning. The exquisite beach and sea during the day and then the vibrant Waikiki skyline at night.The room itself was large and equipped with a full kitchen which included everything you could want or need during your stay. It was cleaned daily and the standards were excellent throughout the hotel.One of the great benefits of the hotel is its location. It is 5 minutes walk to the back and to the main strip on Waikiki however it is far enough away from the shops and restaurants (which can be quite loud at night) to ensure that you get a peaceful stay and a quiet nights sleep.We were also really impressed with the valet service. While this was subject to a daily charge (the same as most hotels in this area), the valet staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout. Offering an efficient service as well as directions when needed.While the hotel isn't as modern as some you will find, it felt welcoming and homely and the furnishings and additional touches in the room made it feel very much Hawaiian.We would definitely look to stay here again if/when we come back and we would also recommend it to friends who were travelling to Waikiki.James","Stockport, United Kingdom","James N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockport, United Kingdom</strong>",6,5.0

The rate was very good in comparison to other hotels I had looked at, the 10% discount was a clincher. Booking process was easy and the hotel staff were prompt in replying to my questions and arranging pre-payment of the account. Unfortunately my flight was cancelled and I did not arrive at the hotel until the following day (day after the expected check in), the receptionist was lovely and I was surprised to discover that the hotel gave me a refund for the night I did not use (due to the flight cancellation). This was most unexpected and certainly made my stay all the more enjoyable. The room was large with plenty of space for my friend and I spread ourselves out.The decor is older and outdated, but this does not detract as the size compensates for the lack of modern interior design. Didn't use the pool as the weather wasn't so great, but looked clean and inviting. There is a fitness centre onsite and the free tea, coffee, newspapers, crackers in the day and sweets in the evening are nice touches.

We wanted something close to the Hale Koa so that we could eat at the restaurants and enjoy the grounds there, and the Luana is just a 5-minute walk through Fort DeRussy Park from the Hale Koa and beach. Our stay with the Luana was memorable and very good. The lobby is pleasant, with bits of Hawaiiana for décor. In the morning there is fresh complimentary coffee on a lobby sideboard, and in both the morning and afternoons there is fruited ice water in the same spot. At the reception desk you will at times find fresh organic fruit, and other times delicious frosted rice cookies, or sometimes small puzzles like Rubix cubes and other games.We were booked into a room on the first floor, which was a good room. There will be no views to speak of on the first floor, but please remember that every hotel has rooms that are not equal, and we had paid an economy price for our room. It had a very large lanai because it was on the first floor. The downside to this was that halfway through our stay, a guest above us had used our lanai to dump their cans, cigarette butts, etc. This is in NO way the fault of the hotel. Sunday morning I went downstairs and let the front desk know, and Saori was very eager to ensure we had a pleasant stay, so she offered us a free upgrade to the 12th floor, which _did_ have a remarkable view of Fort DeRussy and the ocean. Our room on the 12th floor was essentially the same room. The differences: A microwave, a different closet, and because it was higher up, the glass door let in more light. The beds in both rooms were perfectly comfortable.Housekeeping was reliable, good, daily, and when we did encounter our housekeeper, she had a smile ready for us. The staff in the lobby (Tyler was one, Matteo from valet was another) were always smiling and saying hello or good evening.Parking is $35 a night, which is comparable to other parking in Waikiki, but it does allow you in and out parking, and it is valet. Tip: If you are military or a dependent with military ID, the parking at the Hale Koa is a short walk away, and you can by a monthly pass for $100, which is the best deal in Waikiki. Be prepared to show your military ID at the Hale Koa parking garage office.The Luana's best secret? The pool. It is on the first floor and is a little slice of heaven. There are a few cabanas that are free (be prepared to rent cabanas at other hotels). The pool, though small, is beautiful and immaculate, and there is a lush little garden lining the pool and cabana area to give a feeling of seclusion. There are also grills around the corner, if you're interested in barbecuing. Also available are free yoga classes in Wednesday and Sunday morning.We had a lovely time at the Luana, enjoyed the fact that it is a boutique hotel, and would heartily recommend it to anyone.

It was the Outrigger Luana before, and is now owned by Aqua. We choose to stay here due to the location, the quality/value of the rooms, and the staff. This time we sprung for an ocean view 1 bedroom suite. We were put into the top floor, room 1607. We previously had been on floor 6, floor 3, floor 7, floor 2, & other floors, but not a suite room or the top floor. It had a full kitchen, a separate living room and bedroom. The king size bed in this room was very comfortable. My husband & I slept well very night. Everything was great! We felt especially pampered this trip! The room was spectacular. It was well maintained, spacious had a flat panel tv in living room and the bedroom, and had the best view of the ocean with 2 outside patio doors. The hotel is close to the ocean, but not with ocean front hotel room prices. Like the fact you are looking over Ft. DeRussy Park for views to the ocean; it was very scenic. Housekeeping did a good job cleaning the room. We did not experience any sand or dirty floors as mentioned by other reviewers. One of the best things we like about the Luana is the location. On the edge of Waikiki, it is fast way to get in and out of town, with minimal traffic. The wifi my husband said only connected thru room 1609, which made it a little weaker. Love the water & coffee in the lobby. One con is the valet price: $35/day seems a little high when I compared it to the other hotels in the Waikiki area. A big, big shout out to our favorite valet, Abe! Thanks for all the great service through the last few years! Good to see a staff member from the Outrigger days!!

It was a one bedroom ocean view kitchenette . We enjoyed this stay.The bedroom was huge with a king bed, two large bedside tables, a chair, a desk and a television unit . The only issue was the air conditioner blows on one of the sides of the bed . Th louvers on the unit can be adjusted so that this is minimized but it still was a small issue. The bathroom was small but adequate . The only issue with the bathroom is that there was no anti-slip mat on either the marble floor or in the bathtub which resulted in some scary moments . In the master bedroom there is a very large utility closet which could store several months of food and a decent size walk-in closet with about 10 hangers ( there should be more ) and a very useful safe. One small touch that was appreciated was that there were two suitcase stands of the more typical one. This proves very helpful in living out of a suitcase. The bedroom has wall-to-wall carpeting which is old and tired and in need of a good deep cleaning with many stains .The living room had a relatively comfortable couch and a sitting chair as well as two lamps on two side tables. It also had some nice chairs for the kitchen bar . We spent a lot of time staring out of the huge picture window which gave us a beautiful view onto the park and to the ocean beyond. The room was relatively quiet with the exception of the traffic noise around Kalakala and sirens occasionally. This wasn't an issue with the air conditioner running, but I can imagine if one wanted to leave the windows open and not run the air conditioner that this would be an issue even on the 14th floor . The kitchen was more than adequate with a nice flat glass range, a very nice high end dishwashing machine, a very large refrigerator complete with ice maker , a toaster, a full set of knives, a coffee maker and even an Aroma rice maker . We primarily cooked breakfast although one could certainly cook almost any meal here. Dual chrome sinks were also a nice touch. The kitchen could do with a few more mugs for coffee and a few more glasses as well . A larger family might have issues with the number of items . The floors in the bathroom and living room are marble so be careful with wet feet as it's very easy to slip . Another thing that would've been nice is a real bathmat in the bathroom to prevent slippage something with the rubber bottom . A nice touch was in the lobby there were two large water dispensers with fruit-infused water. We loved drinking it every time we passed through the lobby. Lest I sound too picky overall we thought this was an excellent value and we enjoyed staying here . There are lots of electrical outlets which makes using electronic devices using easy . The location down at this end of Kalakua was excellent . It's a little bit less frenetic down here and yet it was only a couple blocks to many good restaurants . In fact , we found that if we went several blocks down to Beachwalk and turned right there were numerous terrific restaurants on that street alone. We enjoyed Bills of Sidney for breakfast and dinner, as well as the Hawaiiana for sushi which is funky but fun. Overall this is an excellent hotel and the staff was very nice. Ebony was particularly helpful. We did find the bed to be too hard but many people would like it just fine. It is definitely on the firm side . We ended up requesting an extra comforter and taking our comforter and the extra comforter and laying it below the top sheet to soften up the bed with a homemade topper. This helped a lot .Would we stay here again? Yes , in a heartbeat. The value is clearly excellent. We paid about $204 per night plus tax plus $35 in and out parking fee . In another hotel we would've had only the one bedroom and no living room and certainly no kitchen. The trade-off is really that there is a little bit of tiredness about this hotel , but I'd rather have a slightly tired decor and a few spots on the rug but have all the extra space and the kitchen and the refrigerator and the excellent location, and nice people in the hotel .","San Jose, California","androidle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",33,5.0

He flew in from Seattle and I flew in from Atlanta. His best friend and her husband both joined us. They flew in from Atlanta as well. Our stay at Luana Waikiki was superb. When we stepped out of the cab we were greeted with open arms and tight hugs from the hotel staff. For a second I thought we were on candid camera, lol. We immediately felt welcomed!!The concierge professionally demanded that we did not touch our luggage and he handled it with extreme care. Such a nice guy! The front desk staff were professional, patient and friendly. We stood in a one bedroom suite and I must say that the bed was very comfortable and the pillows were fluffed. We had a beautiful balcony view as well. The Protea Cafe service was perfect and the breakfast was awesome and reasonable. The hotel was extremely quite and clean and it is walking distance to the beach and shopping. Housekeeping was timely available for our needs. The pool area was relaxing and we had access to the gym. Although we toured the spa, we didn't get the opportunity to get a massage but we will during our next visit. We enjoyed our stay and I will most definitely come back!!!!

We booked on a hotel website, and for what we paid it was a good value. We were put on the 4th floor facing the city and park. It was just an okay view, but we could see a sliver of the ocean as well from out deck so on a higher floor it would have been a good spot. The room was clean but a bit dated, the bathroom was outdated but clean as well. We had a very comfortable bed, and our kids shared the pull out couch and seemed to sleep well. We enjoyed the use of the fridge, and dishes in the room.  We had no smoke detector, which we didn't realize until the last day, it had been removed and the wires were sticking out, but by the time we saw this we were checking out. The staff was amazing at this hotel, however and we especially want to thank Adam! He was very friendly and helpful. We were loaned boogie boards and sand toys and the kids loved this! The valet was awesome, the staff was smiling and helpful all the time and quick to get you what you needed. We liked the free coffee as well in the lobby and grabbed a cup on our way out daily. We stayed here for 3 days and had a rental car to tour the island, and for this purpose it was good. No resort fees and since we were not there during the day we didn't mind that there was smaller pool and it was a 10 minute walk to the beach.I would stay again for a night or two if i was in Waikiki to do business or tour the island but would not spend an entire week here or stay if i was celebrating a honeymoon or something as it was not as modern as I usually like. With that said, maybe other higher rooms or newly renovated might be better. There was some traffic noise at night, but it was quiet by 10 pm or so aside from the odd horn or siren.

I chose this hotel instead of Ala Moana hotel because I wanted to be a little closer to Waikiki, but not too far from the convention center.The rooms are big enough for two people. The refrigerator is nice to keep those tubs of poke you buy :)The bus stops right in front were very convenient. I had expected to walk to the con center but it was too hot so I opted for the 4 min bus ride. It was worth the $2.50.The staff were very friendly and helpful. The towel rental system is great. We also borrowed the chairs one day to relax at the beach. The only con is that the gas station is right by your window if you go with the city view. Motorcycle noises during the day, trucks peeping at night. Even with the windows and doors closed. But we were both the kind where noise doesn't bother our sleep, so it was cool. The air conditioner was pretty loud too, but we didn't need it at night staying in early April.I also got to see half of the fireworks for...Hilton? on Friday. I wish the staff told us about it when we checked in on Thursday. I would have gone to a place where I can actually see it...

But we knew that, and our other low expectations for a condo/hotel were not borne out. Our budget was not in the 5-star range so this allowed us to stay longer in Hawaii and save $ to rent a care.

Comfy beds. We slept so well every night2. Great showers: Water pressure was fantastic3. Location: Close to the beach (nice walk through a park to get there), close to the mall, but further away from Waikiki which we liked since we were away from the crowds but close enough to walk there4. Laundry facilities: You could do your laundry at the hotel which was great.5. The hotel provides beach towels and beach chairs at no extra charge6. The staff were friendly and provided good service7. There was also a gym with equipment enough to get a good workoutThose are generally the most important things for us. As long as we sleep well and the rooms are clean and in a good location - we're happy!But just a few things to keep in mind in case you're looking for more than that:Cons:1. PARKING. DO NOT PARK HERE. $35/night is a total rip off. There's a public parking lot if you drive past the hotel and turn left at Kalaimoku street (beside Tiffany's). The parking lot is on the left (0.2mi away from the hotel) and costs $20 for the night. 2. Elevators: these were really slow and sometimes annoying3. No room service/hotel bars/restaurants. There's a small restaurant called Protea but that's only open from 7am-2pm. If you're feeling hungry past then, you won't find it at the hotel although they provided some very good restaurant recommendations that were within walking distance or a quick cab rideAll in all, a great stay.

The word ""Luana"" means - joyous, happy, contented, and relaxed, in Hawaiian, and this is definitely the most appropriate name for this very comfortable hotel.After staying in some of the bigger, more expensive, resort-style hotels, we realized how much we missed the cozy, homey atmosphere we always feel at Luana. This little gem is the certainly the best deal when you consider the price, location, convenience, and amenities.We love the location because it's just a short walk to all of the activity, dining, beaches, and shopping, but just far enough to be away from all of the hubbub and action in the center of Waikiki. It's also an easy walk (or trolley) to Ala Moana shopping center.Even though we are not right on the beach (which for the great prices of the rooms is a small trade-off), it's only a short walk through the park to the beautiful beaches of Waikiki. Whenever we feel like taking a dip in the ocean, talking a sunset stroll or spending the day lazing on the white sand, it's all just a few minutes away.Some of the features we've always loved about the Luana are; - Clean, comfortable rooms, with lanais (balconies).- Many of the rooms have kitchens - which is rare for most hotels and is a great convenience. - A refreshing, heated pool with plenty of nice lounge chairs for relaxing and soaking up some rays with some cool, shaded areas as well. - Nice gas BBQs not far from the pool for guest use (great for steaks, shrimp, burgers, fish or veggies!).- A beautiful view of peaceful Fort DeRussy Park from the pool area (and also from many of the rooms).- Two different car rental locations are only a few minute walk away (next door and across the street). There's a 24 hour convenience store next door as well.- ""Ville de Coco"" day-spa, massage and nail salon - on the mezzanine level. My wife loves the relaxing massages here. - The large and comfortable lounge on the mezzanine has many areas to sit, relax, read, have a business meeting, study, or just watch the big screen TV.- Free Wi-Fi in every room and throughout the building and pool area.- The laundry room is clean and very convenient. It save us from having to bring too much luggage when we stay for more than a few days.- Proteus, the peaceful little cafe at the lobby entrance, has great breakfasts, lunches, smoothies, cocktails, and pizza! The Luana has recently changed from an Outrigger hotel to an Aqua managed hotel, which made me wonder if the quality of my family's vacation would change at all. I was so delightfully surprised that we actually like it better now and were not in any way disappointed.The new staff is just as pleasant and accommodating as the previous staff so, as usual, we always felt comfortable and at home.The new management has considered and added many nice new amenities which we really appreciated!Just to name a few; - They now have new, free bicycles to lend to guests (a great deal considering the high cost of bike rentals in Waikiki).- There is free, delicious fresh brewed Kona coffee and a variety of nice teas waiting in the lobby every morning.- Plenty of new beach towels, mats and even beach chairs for the asking.- Free morning yoga in the park nearby .- The free wifi throughout the building has been upgraded for speed and ease of use.There are several staff members that I would like to take the time to mention by name and thank for their help, great attitude and big smiles everyday. Rudy, the new general manager is a sweetheart and he's doing an excellent job of keeping the Luana a great place for our family to relax and enjoy our time in Waikiki.Mark, the new Guest Services Supervisor was a pleasure to deal with. Matt, the concierge is one of my best friends whenever we're in Waikiki. Not only does Matt have extensive knowledge about just about anything you might want to do while in Hawaii, but he is always quick to make a dinner reservation (or recommendation), book a sightseeing tour and generally just be super sweet and helpful about any information or assistance you might ever need. He's also fluent in Japanese, which is a nice bonus when we have friends from Japan come stay with us. (there are also several other staff members who speak Japanese)Alli, Abe, and Ryan, the parking valets, always provide us with big smile and a welcome feeling (with or without having a car). Ken and Mathias, the bellmen, also always make us feel happy to return.A big ""Mahalo"" to the Luana and all the staff for making our stay wonderful (again)!In conclusion - although there are a multitude of hotel choices and options available in Waikiki, in my opinion, the Luana is by far THE BEST!.

We were on a lower floor this time (9th instead of 15th), but the view of the ocean was still beautiful. (We could see just the very top of Diamond Head from the 9th floor.)The hotel lobby is quite attractive, and they serve complimentary ice water flavored with fresh lemon and regular and decaf coffee daily. The rooms are very clean, and everything in the room (refrigerator, TV, AC, lights) worked. The AC was a little noisy but kep the room comfortable for us. The bed and pillows were satisfactory.The location of the hotel is very convenient to shopping, restaurants, and the beach. I actually prefer to stay on this end of Kalakaua Ave because it is quieter at night. (The larger hotels located in the midst of the shopping district are more likely to have traffic noise.) The hotel itself (including the other guests) was very quiet throughout our stay, which I really appreciate.I do not know the actual price of the room so it is difficult to comment on value, but I would venture to say that we were able to take advantage of one of the best deals available on a Hawaii vacation.

I had a price point in mind and had a difficult time finding a hotel. I came across the Luana. I could not believe the rates were lower than my price point so I wasn't expecting a lot. The property exceeded my expectations. The rooms are spacious and clean. The beds/pillows are comfortable. The partial ocean view rooms are more like an ocean view room--our room had a beautiful view on the park and the ocean. The refrig was decent size and nice to have for our own beverages and sandwiches. The pool area was clean and had comfortable lounge chairs and provided nice beach towels. Also provided suntan lotion by dispenser if you had forgotten yours. Complimentary coffee and infused water was nice. Complimentary boogie boards and floaties to take to beach as well as bikes to check out. I regret not taking advantage of the bikes...maybe next time. Protea café is right outside front doors. They serve an excellent breakfast and large portions. Hotel is very accommodating for people with flights in the evening. They will hold your luggage for the day and will provide a room at half rate if you need a late check out. Location is excellent if you don't need to be right on the beach. It is a 10 min walk to the beach but we felt like it was worth the walk for the excellent price of the room. A little exercise never hurts anyone! The beaches are very crowed in Waikiki, however, this end of the beach is nicer, wider, and less crowded. The main strip of Waikiki is very noisy and congested with traffic, the hotel is located in an area that is a little less hectic. At minimum would recommend the rooms with partial ocean view..it's well worth the extra money.","Bozeman, Montana","luv2trvlondal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bozeman, Montana</strong>",8,5.0

I enjoy planning our vacations and plan most of our activities, restaurants and car rental based on where we were staying so when we were told this after a 6 hour flight from Arizona we were completely shocked and disappointed. We booked our stay at the Aqua Aloha Surf almost 5 months before and are both very seasoned travelers who have fortunately never encountered this before. We were told by the front desk at the Aqua Aloha Surf that the Luana was nicer and would enjoy our stay there. So, they gave us a box of chocolates and paid for our cab to the Luana. Upon arriving at the Luana, it seems they were not informed completely about our stay. We the displaced travelers now had to finish the job of the staff at the Aqua Aloha Surf and go over our rates & the parking fees (as they were less at the Aqua Aloha Surf). We had to take time out of our vacation to advise people of what they should have known. This to me is not ok and poor customer service. Not to mention that the girl at the front desk of the Luana was quite condescending when I mentioned how dissatisfied I was with my husband and I having to spend our vacation time discussing all of this with her. It was our vacation that we planned for well in advance and we should not have had to been aggravated with all of this. Our room was not ready upon our arrival so we went to lunch and when we came back we were able to go into our room. The room was fine, simple but comfortable. We stayed in a deluxe room. We had a partial kitchenette, sink, refrigerator, cutlery, cups, plates, coffee maker, no microwave. The bathroom is very simple, they do provide soap, body wash, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. There is a tub/shower and the towels are of a decent quality. The bed was comfortable as were the linens. We had a small table in our room, which worked well on the days we left early and picked up something for breakfast from the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf across the street. We had a city view and a small balcony that had 2 chairs and a small table. Our view was of Kalakaua, the gas station below and a side view of the pool. It was not loud every night but there were some times that were louder than others. There is a ton of drawer space and a decent amount of hangers (if there are 2 or more people, I would recommend bringing some extras or ask for more). The room also has a small ironing board and an iron. Wifi in the room is not great and only one person can access it at a time on their device. The room overall could use some upkeep, as we noticed some wear on the walls and on the amoire. The hallways look like they too are ready for some renovations, we noticed stains on the carpets but overall they were not horrible. There are 3 elevators and they are fairly quick, although we did have to wait a little longer on occasion. The lobby is pleasant and they offer free coffee and tea in the morning as well as water with cucumbers or oranges in the afternoon. There is a bar upstairs that we did not see being used as well as a nice sitting area and shell collection. There is a small café just outside the lobby and they offer breakfast and lunch with limited hours. There is a valet and you can park your car for $35 a day. The location is very convenient and ended up being fine for most things we had planned(a bit of a walk for some of the things we planned and we even had to cancel a few things based on how far things were from the Aqua Aloha Surf). There is an ABC store and another ABC type store right across the street, a gas station next door, as I mentioned earlier the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is across the way and is great for a quick breakfast or cup of coffee or tea. Kalakaua has a ton of upscale shopping and some restaurants to choose from. The #23 bus is on Kalakaua and Saratoga should you want to take it to Diamond Head-you will want to pick it up on the same side of the street where EggsNThings is located. If you wish to take the bus to Downtown Honolulu you can catch the #2 bus right in front of the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. We feel the overbooking at the Aqua Aloha Surf is understandable but we do not feel we were properly accommodated. The Luana is fine but is it that much better than the Aqua Aloha Surf? Possibly if they comped us a night or upgraded our room we would have felt better about our stay, but neither of those things happened. Being displaced is not a good way to start a vacation and it followed us throughout our stay since we had to change plans due to the distance from things we originally scheduled. Overall, our hotel was not the main reason for our visit to Honolulu and we did not spend a ton of time there, but the hotel itself was pleasant enough.","Atlanta, Georgia","love2traveltogether</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",505,3.0

The A/C was a bit noisy, but it worked like white noise. We booked a partial ocean view and we had that with the water being about a quarter of the mile away. A large park adjoined our side, unlike the gas station and/or busy street on other sides. This made the area seem very welcoming for someone coming from a snow bound home. You are at one end of the Waikiki strip and this enabled us to walk out and back as much as we wanted.

The hotel is located on the more north end of Waikiki, and I thought the location was great. It was a short walk to the Convention Center, and it was also easy to walk to the shops, restaurants, and beaches of Waikiki or to the Ala Moana Center. Our room was on the 3rd floor facing east, so we didn't have too much of a view, but we did have a sliding glass door to a small balcony. For the most part, the room wasn't too loud, except sometimes in the morning traffic could be a little noisy. The room itself included a small kitchen area with countertops, a refrigerator, a coffee maker, dishes, and utensils (no microwave). There are also 2 gas grills available to use down at the pool area. The room was clean and spacious, but the decor was a little dated. It seems like this is an older hotel that is slowly being upgraded. The hotel includes a small pool and a small gym (but I didn't use either). There are also washers and dryers available to use for about $1 each. The restaurant downstairs (Protea) had really good breakfast (it's a little pricey but so is everything in Waikiki). Some downsides to the hotel: the elevators were really slow and inconsistent, parking is $35 per day. The hotel staff were great, particularly the valet staff and the concierge. The hotel is on the small side (15 floors), which is kind of nice because there's less noise and people coming and going. Also, for the price point, I think the amenities and location are excellent. I would definitely consider staying here again if traveling to Waikiki. The only deterrent for me might be the parking rate.","Falmouth, Massachusetts","shannon9585</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Falmouth, Massachusetts</strong>",7,4.0

If you are unaware how Hotwire works, I chose my star category and location and, once I paid for the reservation, then I got to find out where I am staying. I chose 3.5 star thinking I was getting a nicer hotel. This was far from 3.5 star.The room I was assigned had to be the worst room in the building (maybe saved for Hotwire guests who tried to get a good deal!), it was on the 2nd floor with a city view. The view was really of the gas station right next door. This property is right on Kalakaua Avenue which is super busy. The road noise was unbelievable. The door to go to the balcony was literally a wooden (swing open type) door, not a sliding balcony door like most other hotels. 3.5 stars? I had to change rooms after one night (so that I could get sleep). I had to pay an extra $30/night for a partial ocean view and at a higher floor. I'll admit it was a little better, (I got a sliding glass door this time!). Still a little noisy when the door is open, but that comes with Waikiki.Parking was $35/night which I find pretty ridiculous. I have stayed in Waikiki several times and most places are $25/night.Also, don't be fooled by the pictures. I thought the pictures made the hotel seem really nice and updated. The hotel seems to have been renovated at some point by adding granite countertops. I believe this must have been the extent of the renovation. I'll admit the countertops were nice but rest of the room was a little dated. Wicker chairs, old looking bedding, etc.On a more serious note, I traveled with my family including an 18 month old. The balcony railings were not safe for her. I doubt this is a Luana Waikiki issue, and rather a code issue, but my child could have easily fallen through the rails. I don't say this to bring the property down, I say this as a parent who looked over at his child playing on the balcony and freaked out realizing what could happen. I'm sure Luana Waikiki is up to code (or at least I hope they are) but I have no doubt my child could easily fit through spacing of the railing bars. See my attached picture and judge for yourself. Needless to say, the balcony door remained shut.I don't have a vendetta against the property nor Hotwire. I will use Hotwire again. But just be aware that things are not always what they seem (3.5 star?? Maybe 2) and you get what you pay for (I got a great price on the room before I paid to change rooms).","Anchorage, Alaska","Kevin M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anchorage, Alaska</strong>",5,2.0

Front desk was hugely helpful, got us into the room at 11am which was awesome. Pool is lovely with a view of Derussey Park and plenty of chairs. The Luana is right on Derussey park so walking to the beach is very pleasant and you can easily access the beach from the park or through the Hilton Hawaiian Village.

They offer free yoga and bike rentals which we didn't end up using, but it's nice to know it's there. The only complaint we had was that the daily housekeeping was mediocre, they were in the room early (as in if you weren't out of the room by 8-make sure you have the do not disturb sign up) but sometimes things only seemed half done, the floors never seemed fully swept and they would just leave unopened toilet paper rolls and tissue boxes in the washroom even when not needed, they didn't take out garbage unless it was placed in the small garbage can so as a result we had empty bottles and pizza boxes on the counter. All in all I would recommend the hotel if you're going to Waikiki to see the sights (as we were) as it is one of the simpler hotels on the strips and not a resort experience-which is what we were looking for.Quick tips-avoid the coffee in the lobby and rooms, it's very weak and the pot in the lobby always had a funny taste to it.

We were so pleased with our choice - the staff were so very friendly and accommodating, especially Jackie on the front desk and Marco (?) the bellman. They were so gentle, calm and helpful. The room was clean, bright and cheerfully furnished with tropical prints and furniture. The bed was very comfortable! The kitchenette was extremely well equipped, clean and modern. Having some cooking and food storage facilities is a BIG money saver and makes it feel more like a home away from home rather than an impersonal hotel. We had a partial oceanview studio kitchenette on the 9th flor. It had a small lanai, and the view was fabulous - overlooking Waikiki to the east, peek a boo view of Diamond head, gorgeous full view of Fort DeRussy park, and of course, the ocean in the near distance. We saw whales several days from our lanai & the sound of birds in the park each morning was so nice. We did hear a fair bit of traffic noise from Kalakaua Ave., but it is to be expected given the excellent location of the hotel. As we always do anywhere we travel, we used earplugs and that cut most of the traffic and air conditioner noise.The pool, though on the smaller side, is much bigger in reality than what shows on the hotel website - and what a beautiful warm temperature!!! Very clean as well. Even on cloudy, rainy days, the pool was heavenly. The pool deck is very peaceful as it is on the park side of the hotel. Very comfortable loungers, greenery, cabanas for shade. We also used the exercise room, which was small but well equipped, bright and clean. We used the guest laundry which was very convenient and reasonably priced. Again, a nice ""home away from home"" feature, especially for long stays.Ft. DeRussy beach is just a short peaceful walk through the park from the hotel; super nice mellow beach. The hotel provides complimentary beach towels, beach chairs and other items to guests, which we made use of. The hotel even offers the loan of folding bicycles to guests; we didn't get a chance to use them, but the general manager showed us how they worked and they seem ideal for touring around Waikiki. All the action of Waikiki is a short walk from the hotel, most of the main public bus routes have stops very near the hotel, Dollar/Thrifty car rental is just across the street & lots of restaurants nearby (including the very good little Protea Cafe in the hotel lobby - great gluten-free pizza!). The closest grocery store is a 10 minute easy walk west, on Hobron Lane (Food Pantry).A couple of notes: this is an older building (early 70's) that has been well-kept. However, the patio doors are very thin (single pane and not sealed) and let a lot of noise in. Also, at least in our room, although the air conditioner worked well, it had a very loud fan noise and vibration. We requested that maintenance look at it, but it didn't seem to resolve the noise. We used earplugs at night and that helped. All in all, however, highly recommended, especially for longer stays. Try to get a room as high as possible, and definitely go for a partial oceanview and as far towards the south side of the building as possible to avoid traffic noise.","Vancouver, Canada","monavan12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",3,5.0

It's not in the main Waikiki area but you can easily walk everywhere. We had lunch in the park almost everyday and close to the beach for sunsets and dinner. The only draw back for us was we like to leave our lanai door open for that lovely breeze but being on the main road it was noisy.( all night you can hear sirens). Our room was larger than most others so we had plenty of space. Full kitchen, nice bathroom, great service . Pool area was small and well kept up but we didn't use it much. A small restaurant in front of property was very good but usually full. Lots of places to eat in the area and down on the beach area. Front desk very nice to work with and concierge for outings.

The room was quite spacious but basic. The air-con was very noisy & kept on clicking on & off during the night so it was noisy. We were on the 15th floor but the traffic noise was still very obvious & the sirens were relentless. The staff were courteous but not overly warm or engaging. It really is more 3.5 stars than 4 stars. Also had a massage at the spa there at the Ville de coco. The therapist was very competent but I thought the 30 min massage was really expensive.

The room setup is nice with a small refrigerator, large kitchen type counter, dishes, knives, etc. The air conditioner worked great. The hotel is close to two ABC stores and several places to eat. There is a pool, work out room, and laundry that I did not get a chance to use. The second day front dest staff was more friendly than those on duty the first day. I asked for a room upgrade the second day to a higher floor and got one on the 15th floor for only 10 dollars more. Each room appears to have a small balcony with two chairs and a small table. A travel and booking service is also represented in the lobby and I found the lady there most helpful and friendly.

We booked a city/park view room, rather than a partial ocean view room, on the consideration that the beach is a couple of blocks away and we wouldn't be able to see it anyway. When we arrived, we were shown to a room on the second floor overlooking a gas station!!! No ""park view"" at all. The gruff, large man at the desk told us that we had booked the cheapest accommodation and this was all that was available. He said the hotel was full and he could not upgrade us even if we paid for it. I put my foot down...this was my first trip to Hawaii in many years and I did not want to spend it looking at a gas station...a very run-down one at that. Fortunately, a nice clerk in the back came to the desk and found a better room for us...this one on the third floor, and overlooking the triangular park in the middle of Kalakaua Avenue. This was much better, even though there was a bit of traffic noise from the busy street. Another odd thing about the room is that there was a huge kitchen, with cupboards, plates, utensils, refrigerator and a big sink, but nothing to cook with! Not even a microwave. Our theory is that this hotel is also a condominium, so I guess people renting the rooms as condos are supplied with a microwave. In view of the size of the kitchen, it seems as though the hotel could spend a couple of dollars adding microwaves, making the rooms truly useable. Many inexpensive accommodations provide microwaves these days. Parking was expensive at $25 for the one night we had a rented car. And they even wanted to charge 99 cents to make local calls....so bring your cell phone. Did not try the wifi supposedly provided as I could rely on the fast 4G service in this area for smartphone use. On the plus side, the walk through the park to the hotel was pleasant, and the crazy/busy part of Waikiki was about 10 minutes away on foot. Had breakfast one morning in the Protea cafe and that was good. The other mornings we picked up picnic breakfast food at the Whaler's grocery across the street and took it to the beach!!","Port Townsend, Washington","azzure</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Port Townsend, Washington</strong>",131,3.0

They moved us to another room, up a few higher levels which was lovely and had a view of the ocean.

The lady at the front desk said that they only one room with two double beds in the entire hotel.The room is clean & size is ok. The cleaning staff does not sweep or mop the floor in the room daily so it's really dusty. Waikiki is very dusty so that makes it worse. There are ants in the kitchenette so you need to watch where you store your food. The hotel is old & the cleaning staff does an ok job keeping it clean. The carpet in the hotel hallway on the 16th floor is old & smelly.The staff is friendly & helpful. It's probably the best feature of this hotel.Originally, we booked with P.G. Plover to go to the Waikele Outlet Mall. However, the shuttle bus (operated by Roberts Hawaii) only has a few pickups locations thoroughout Waikiki. The bell desk attendant told us the hotel uses a third party company to drive customers to the mall for the same price, $15 round trip, but they pick up customers at their hotels. We cancelled pur reservation with P.G. Plover & went with that recommended company, Ali' Trans & Tours. What a mistake!!!! The bus was dirty, smelly & the seats are stained with god know what. There was no seatbells (unlike Discover Hawaii Tours shuttle bus) & no a/c. The driver was crude & drove like a maniac. He barked at customers rudely. I told the lady at the front desk they should not use that company as that brings bad reputation to their hotel.","Edmonton, Canada","suziecute91</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",29,3.0

Some even remember us from prior years' visits. Rooms are functional and modern with comfortable beds. The pool is rather small but we mostly spent our time on the beach anyways, which was a short 5-minute walk thru Fort DeRussy park.

I was traveling on my own to attend a friend's wedding and didn't spend much time in my room, so I wanted a hotel that was priced reasonably and also not too far from Waikiki. The Outrigger is only about a 5-10 minute walk from the beach, and there are also fast food restaurants, nearby ABC Stores, and tons of shopping down the street (Kalakaua Ave). I had a city-view room with a small balcony and although the street noise did bug me the first night, I really didn't even notice it after that. My only complaint about the rooms would have to be the loud air conditioning. The hotel concierge, Matt, was very helpful whenever I had questions about bus routes or setting up a car rental, and made sure I always had everything I needed.Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel for those traveling solo or looking for a hotel slightly cheaper than the beach fronts.

It may not be on the actual beach front, but may as well be. We would have preferred a slightly wider/ deeper balcony. If you have issues with heights, then this small balcony is not going to help you with feeling grounded at all. But you do not need to sit on the balcony to get this great view of the sea and Diamond Head (Which rises above the other hotels).The bus routes outside the Luana gave us easy access to everything we wanted to do (From going to Diamond Head, to Ala Moana Shopping Centre).We used the kitchen in our room for making many of our meals, and managed to get pretty much everything that we wanted from the local shops. Just like being at home in Australia regarding food.The staff at the hotel were all very professional and appeared to be naturally happy (Not your usual pasted on false smile that we are used to in many hotels).The Luana is very neat and clean. Our room was cleaned thoroughly each day. And if we got back to our room before midday for lunch, we were fortunate each day to find that our room had already been finished, so we would not be disturbed.We did not try the cafe on the ground floor, as each time we passed by it was fairly full.There is a pool which was fairly small, but as we are a couple of minute’s walk from the beautiful beach, you may never use this yourself. We used it once, and prefer the sea ourselves (Even if a German tourist had just had their arm bitten off by a shark the day before).Food shopping wise:There is a small convenience store on the opposite side of the road (Called ABC store), in fact, the ABC stores are everywhere you go here. They carry everything from bread, milk and cheese, to tourist T shirts and fridge magnets.We found the supermarket shopping to be much cheaper and better selection at the Foodland supermarket at the nearby Ala Moana shopping centre (Catch the bus or walk there, if you are OK with walking, it is not that far, and you get to see more of the place into the bargain. We did find that although the bus system is cheap to use, it was hard to get a seat each time, as it is used by a lot of people, and when you are stuck in long traffic jams there and back, it doesn't save you much more time than getting some exercise with the walk anyway).Next time we travel from Aus to the USA we will be stopping off at Hawaii again, and would not look any further than this hotel ourselves.Clean, Convenient location and great staff 10/10 for us.Mark & AndreaPerthWestern Australia","Perth, Australia","Mark-Andrea-Perth</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",34,5.0

One big plus for us this time, is that we were able to have a great view of the Friday night fireworks from the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The Luana location is within a 15 minute walk to the Ala Moana Shopping centre as well as downtown waikiki. Luana is also located on the edge of Waikiki and is much quieter than the centre of Waikiki. The beach is just a short walk across the Fort deRussy Park. The city bus transportation is directly across the street where Kuhio and Kalakaua meet. I exteremly recommend this mode of transportation as it will , take you wherever you want to go.

Lovely view from the lanai over the park to the ocean, and certainly a lot quieter than further along the Waikiki strip. Only a few minutes walk along Kalakaua gets you to the activity of Waikiki. The front desk staff were obliging, helpful and friendly, as were the valet guys. The parking fee was probably a bit steep, but I don't think there is cheaper parking available at any of the major Waikiki hotels, and the valet efficiency and good humour went a long way to justifying it.Lots of traffic noise is hardly a surprise given the location, but a room on a higher floor and overlooking the park certainly minimises the distraction.Free wifi was excellent, with a strong signal and no need for constant sign-ins. The view of the Friday fireworks from the Hilton Hawaiian Village was indeed a classic Hawaiian experience from our lanai, and the echos against the hotel buildings of Waikiki were spectacular. We intended to eat at the Protea Café, but without any air conditioning (only ceiling fans) it was just too warm in there for comfort, so a visit to Vit's across the road provided an excellent meal at a reasonable price. Also great value is the 24-hr. Wailana Coffee House, just a short walk across the park.Outrigger Luana is close to everything you need in Waikiki - shopping, dining, transport, ABC stores everywhere, pleasant staff, and comfortable accommodation. Shopping nearby at Ala Moana is a bit hit-and-miss during their renovations, but it's worth making your way out of town a little bit to Kahala Mall, Pearl Ridge Shopping Centre or Waikele Factory Outlets for more relaxed shopping. Also Windward Mall at Kaneohe on the North Shore is good value. These are all easy drives, but a $2.50 bus will get you to any of them.A very enjoyable stay at Outrigger Luana, and we will certainly return.","Melbourne, Australia","robtup</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",17,5.0

Tiled floors and swamp-cooler A/C make the room unattractive; let's just say you wouldn't post a photo of your room to share with your friends.

This hotel is on a major street that leads to the beach so its busy . Our room had a king size bed with a full kitchenette.

My unit was set up like a studio apartment. The furnishings and full kitchen were wonderful. I LOVED the honed Travertine floors! But I disagree with what was reported by other reviewers. This hotel is not conveniently located. It is not walking distance from the main part Waikiki, nor the beach. There are very few restaurants in the area. I found it necessary to take a taxi practically everywhere I wanted to go. This really added to the cost of staying here.The Ville de Coco Spa was terrific. I had a massage, manicure and pedicure during my stay. They were all first rate, and the prices were what you might expect. The Protea restaurant is not as advertised. It was built as a coffee bar, but had a few tables added and a kitchen. There are four two seater, high top tables and one large table where family seating takes place. They close each day at two in the afternoon. While the food is quite good, the place is noisy, stuffy and cannot really qualify as a cafe, let alone a restaurant. Although this hotel is not what I expected from the advertising, I believe it would function well for the business traveller or perhaps families planning to stay for an extended period (the kitchen, gym and laundry are a convenience). A car is a must, but be prepared to pay $25/night for parking (pretty standard on the islands). If staying in Honolulu in the future, I will probably stay nearer the action, nearer the beach, where everything I want is within walking distance.","Kapolei, Hawaii","lagunalady27</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kapolei, Hawaii</strong>",4,3.0

Perhaps a highlight is the little restaurant just outside the foyer the Protea Cafe...very nice breakfast and lunch food....it isnt open for dinners but I am sure they could do tapas and cocktails.Concierges were really good organising activities, very efficient ....but not imaginative.

This was a major plus for our military family. Our hotel room had a kitchenette and was a partial ocean view room with a balcony. The balcony view was awesome, especially at night! The hotel is very near shopping, the beach and other touristy Waikiki stuff. We also parked our rental car here and were charged $15.00 a day for valet (military rate) the civilian rate is $25.00 a day, unlimited access in and out of the garage. For Waikiki, this is a pretty good rate. The valet parking attendants were also very nice and offered any information or directions that we wanted. The gym is pretty adequate and offers your normal work out machines and equipment. The pool area is nice and has gazebos if you would like to take a break from the sun.

I can't complain about the cleanliness, or the amenities provided by the place. We stayed in a studio style condo, and we had everything we needed. We didn't cook at all, but there were pots, pans, silverware etc if you are so inclined. The place was cleaned daily, towels replaced and all the works so it made the stay comfortable. We were on the 4th floor and we had a tiny view of the beach, I would imagine the people up higher than us had a great view!! By the way they did have a nice little patio with a couple chairs and a table so you could sit outside and enjoy the awesome Hawaii weather. Overall it was definitely 4 out of 5 stars. I would stay there again, although I think I would prefer a place a little closer to the beach. The walk to get to Waikiki beach is about 15 minutes I would say, but it is very close to all of the shopping right along the main drag if that is more your thing. The only thing I really didn't like very much was that they charge $25 a day for valet parking.

I chose it because of the price, good reviews and location. We were only in Waikiki for 2 nights before moving up to the North Shore for the remainder of our stay. We live in a large urban area and like to get away from the crowds on vacation. So while we wanted to experience Waikiki we didn't want to be in the middle of all that chaos. The Luana was a good choice. I booked our room - a partial ocean view- through American Express when it was on sale. The day before we flew out I called and requested to be as high as possible while still with an ocean view. Upon arrival they gave us a small upgrade to a kitchenette, partial ocean view - #914. The room was nice, but not especially large. Probably about 250 -300 sq ft. It had a 2 burner stove top, microwave/convection oven, small refrigerator/freezer and a sink. There were also a couple of plates, glassware, mugs, and silverware - along with a 2 cup coffee pot. There was a Queen bed and a small futon type sofa, round table and tv. The bathroom was small, but did supply a hair dryer. We had a small step-out balcony with 2 chairs and a small round table. We had a nice view of Waikiki, Fort DeRussey Park, the ocean and a roof down below. :)It was fine with us and we loved not having a high rise building next to us! We had a pleasant stroll through the park one morning and the beach down at that end is great - very wide, things to eat/drink are available along with chairs and umbrellas. The center of Waikiki is only 10 minutes or less away and gave us a chance to burn off some of those calories we ate! We had a great time and felt very safe the entire time regardless of the time of night or day.On Friday night we were able to see from our balcony the fireworks the Hilton Hawaiian Village sets off at dark - about 7:45 pm. Another great feature because we were high up, was to hear the fireworks echoing off the skyscrapers in the area. Very cool!The staff at the Luana were very friendly and courteous. Our car was available within minutes of asking for it. And I loved the flavored fruit water that was available in the lobby when we returned from our walks. We never had any problems with noise.

Having a bath tub was a real and much appreciated bonus.There was a bit of noise in the room when the door to the balcony was open but it was minimal. I am sure it would be much noisier in the centre of Waikiki. Bring ear plugs if you are very noise sensitive, although my husband didn't use his.There is a laundry which I used several times. I used it in the morning and never had to wait for a machine as there are several.There is also a small gym with most of the basic equipment.The pool looked inviting and appeared to be well used.Free wifi is available in the room and it worked extremely well.All the staff we encountered were friendly and polite.Finally - the location. This hotel is in a brilliant position. Just out of the mad hustle and bustle of Waikiki but close enough to walk to most things you would need. The centre of Waikiki was a very pleasant 10 minute walk, Ala Moana was about 25 minutes in the other direction. We also walked to the Aquarium and Zoo.This hotel ticks all the boxes, is great value and we would definitely stay there again.","Melbourne, Australia.","Swansforever</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia.</strong>",62,5.0

First let me state that I consider the ""Outrigger"" brand to be the best in Hawai'i. Every Outrigger, I have stayed at, has exemplified Hawaiian sense of place and aloha spirit. The Luana is a boutique cond/hotel located about five minutes from what I consider to be the best beach along the Waikiki strip To get to the beach you simply walk through beautiful Fort DuRusy park to beach access between the Outrigger Reef and the Waikiki Shore hotels. The beach itself is wider and less crowded then the iconic section that fronts the Moana andRoyal Hawaiian, There are concession stands that rent every conceivable kind of water equipment; surf and paddle boards, buggie boards, kayaks, and paddle wheelers. The waves break far out so this spot lends itself to swimming. But what about the hotel itself? The standard rooms are about 300 sq feet, not including their generous balconies. Renovated about 2004, the furniture is beginning to show its age, but the style is Tropical Retro and the weathered appearance just ads to the vibe. Each single has either a small kitchen or kitchenette with microwave. There is flat screen televion and Internet access In every room. The rooms themselves are immaculately clean and the mattresses are very comfortable with douvet style bedding. At the Luana it's all about room location. The best rooms are on the Diamond Head side closest to the park. These rooms afford excellent views of the park and ocean and rival those of the much more expensive Trump Towers. the pool is small but maintained at a comfortable temperature. it looks out over the green belt and I have never had to wait for a deck lounge. For me, the best part of the Luana experience is the staff. They couldn't be nicer or more helpful. This current stay I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite and I never want to leave. Yes you can spend a lot more money to be right on the beach but you won't be treated any better for any price. The Luana is adjacent to Beach Walk and luxury row. it is located on the less crowded West end of Waikiki. Mahalo Luana for making my stays with you so pleasant. it goes without saying that I will be returning again on my next.visit.",California,"hot4hawaii</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",14,5.0

The Concergie Stacey was excellent & helpful, offering guidance & advice on shows to attend, like the luau & the Big Island by plane. Breakfast was tasty & staff was polite & very helpful. We used the laundry on the 1st floor to catch up on washing. It had a kitchenette & we asked for a kettle for tea making. Close to the beach & other hotels for restaurants.

Great views of the city and with a kitchenette it was perfect to spend several days in prior to our cruise. Our check-in did not go smoothly at all! It was almost as if they did not want to give us the early-bird special that was booked weeks in advance. I had confirmation numbers and a print out and tried to show it to front desk personnel but they did not even look at it, saying that the reservation was booked under something else. It eventually got straightened out but after traveling for more than 12 hours it was annoying. Valet parking is $25 a day in and out all day. That was OK – a little over priced but at least there was parking.The restaurant in the hotel was very nice and the food was good and for Hawaii was reasonably priced. The staff there was very nice and so was the valet parking staff. I could only get internet very early in morning after that it was VERY slow and frustrating. That included my phone and laptop. The Concierge is EXTREMELY helpful and Stacey really helped us out one day. She made phone calls and arrangements for us and took a lot of stress and pressure off of us. She was the best! Loved the water with fresh fruit in it in the lobby. So refreshing after walking up and down Kalakaua Ave. The room was definitely spacious and the beds were comfy. The kitchenette was an added plus and was stocked with dishes and other items we needed. It’s a small frig but that was all we needed. The bathroom was a nice size and updated.One of the days we were there our room ended up not being cleaned. We had been gone all day and came back around 3pm to relax before going to dinner – room was the way we left it that morning, thank goodness we are very neat. We called down to get some fresh towels which they brought up right away and asked if we wanted our room cleaned right then?! We found out that they clean rooms late or so we were told. I wasn’t sure what to make of that, it didn’t happen again.Overall I would stay there again if I am ever in Hawaii again.","Orlando, Florida","Trea1s</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",45,4.0

I'll take it. We arrived at the hotel at about 4pm and we were checked in right away. It was a really smooth process. The staff members were very welcoming, everyone from the bellman, to the valet attendant, to the front desk, to the concierge. Every time we came back to the hotel we were greeted at the entrance and that was a nice touch. The room itself was a standard room with a mini fridge and a sort of kitchen counter area with a sink and dishes. I was actually surprised at how spacious the room was. The room even had a pull-out couch. So for the price we paid, we were very happy. The room was clean and housekeeping did a great job of ensuring that the room was always tidy pretty much right after we left for the day (I know this because we went for breakfast once, came back, and the room was immaculate).The hotel is located on Kalakaua Ave. which is pretty much the main strip near Waikiki beach. It is literally a 10-minute walk from everything you need. There were tons of restaurants, shops, convenience stores...so many things to see and do. The International Marketplace was also really close, which was great. One thing that I liked a lot about the location of the hotel was the fact that it wasn't too far into the strip because we ended up walking to the Ala Moana centre area, which was in the opposite direction of the beach, but the distance was just right. It is also located near the Bus stops (GREAT way to get around the island!).I did want to compliment the service of the concierge and the bellmen at this hotel. I used to work at a very large hotel in downtown Toronto, so I do look out for the quality of these two services whenever I happen to travel. Matthew at the concierge desk was awesome. We booked a trip to the Polynesian Cultural Center with him and he got us some amazing seats at their evening show. He also gave us some good advice when it came to other excursions that we saw in the coupon books that you find everywhere. Another girl who was working with him suggested one of the best hole-in-the-wall restaurants in the area for real Italian pizza (V-lounge near Ala Moana) so that made us happy as well. Matthew referred us to the bellmen when we needed transportation to the airport because they were able to get us a better deal on shuttle prices, which was great because we had to make a few trips to the airport (inter-island day trips). One of the bellmen, I think his name was Devin, arranged a shuttle for us which arrived promptly at the scheduled time. He made some small talk with us while we were waiting and made us feel right at home. A+ for the staff here!The Outrigger Luana Waikiki is probably the median in terms of pricing when it comes to the Outrigger hotels in Waikiki, but it was perfect for us. Great quality and great service, that's what matters.","Toronto, Canada","Kim P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",5,5.0

Nice bath amenities for those of you who need to pack lite and not bring your own. Relatively quiet within the building and other than some hallway sounds the walls were not paper thin and didn't here much noise from other tenants. THE ONLY MINUS (and it can be a big one) is the street noise being located on busy Kalakaua Avenue. We were on the eleventh story and still heard it quite well (particularly on weekend) however the ac/fan is loud enough to drown out the noise (which can be another minus if you don't like a/c noise - we just had it on fan which was quieter but did the trick - I got used to the fan sound after second night!) SO TIP WHEN BOOKING ROOM: Book at least a partial ocean view which is higher off of ground and request a room on the park side as opposed to the street side if possible and you'll get much less street noise.Not fancy but very nice hotel for a moderate budget. Conviently located next to everything you need for a comfy stay including a Thrifty/Dollar car rental right down street and convenience stores across street (we liked ""Whalers"" ). Nice little gift shop in lobby and Protea cafe was very good. Hotel staff very proffessional and friendly. LOVED THE FRUIT FLAVORED WATER they have in lobby - very nice touch and popular! They put all kinds of fresh fruit and even cucumbers in the water cooler and it makes for a delicious, refreshing drink! Booked a partial ocean view hotel room for two and was just what we needed - had a comfortable queen bed with a pull out sofa/sitting area as well. Room was spacious and came with an in-roomsafe and closet, big tv and table area, kitchen sink and counter, cabinets and utensils, coffee,sugar,cream packets (first packet of coffee free - one dollar per packet after that.) Could have used a microwave but unless you book a room with a kitchenette you won't get one. Nice balcony area with chairs and small table.

We opted to rent a car, and use the valet parking, and we never waited more than a few minutes to drop off or pick up. It's not a bad walk to the beach through Fort Debussy Park, but if you want to be right ""on the beach"" this hotel is not for you. For the space, you cannot beat the price!

It's at the start of the strip and next to a park so it's a little quieter which we liked at night. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to the heart of the strip. And the beach is a 5 mins walk south of the hotel through the park. The staff were all nice and friendly and we liked the fruity water in the lobby every day. This part of the beach wasn't as crowded as the main part of the beach with all the big hotels and resorts. We liked having a kitchen which helped to save on time looking for something to eat and on food cost which is expensive in Hawaii. Our room had a two burner stove, coffee maker, toaster, microwave oven which also doubled as a convection oven, mini fridge along with the pots, pans, cooking utensils, plates, cutlery etc. The bus stop was right across the street along with an ABC store and a general store. A little further walk about 5-10 mins is the Food Pantry grocery store which is where we bought our meat and stuff to cook our meals. At the front of the Food Pantry store is some food vendors for take away. Right across the street from the hotel is also the Thrifty car rental and next door is a gas station. So, everything is close by and the advantage of being at the start of the strip is that you avoid all the traffic when you head out to see the rest of the island. We would stay here again.

The hotel staff were welcoming and helpful. We did not have need to use the small hotel restaurant since we made breakfast in the room and sampled some of the first rate restaurants nearby.

We really enjoyed it and would happily stay here again in the future.We booked a one bedroom deluxe ocean view room with a full kitchen. The kitchen was great, very well appointed with an enormous fridge, microwave, stove and oven and dishwasher. There was enough crockery and cutlery and cooking implements. We were able to cook full dinners here for us and the kids.The living room had a fold out couch which the kids slept in while we had the king sized bed in the bedroom (which was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in!). The living room had a small balcony with a view over Fort De Russy park and the bedroom had the same size balcony with street views. Each balcony was big enough for 2 chairs and a small table. There was only 1 bathroom which was off the bedroom, which meant the kids had to come into the bedroom overnight to use it. Each room had it's own TV which was great for the kids first thing in the morning.Being set back from the beach we had water views between the beach front hotels, but not sand views. The view was lovely though with the park land in front of us. We also had a ringside view of the Friday night fireworks at the Hilton.While this hotel is not in the main block, it is a very good location, a short walk from the beach, a short walk (3 blocks) from the convention centre (I had a conference to attend) and a nice walk around the park to the Hilton Hawaiian Village if you want to take advantage of those facilities (the lagoon is brilliant for the kids.) It is better located for the Waikiki shops, International Market Place than the Hilton, etc. It is a short bus ride or about 15-20 mins walk to Ala Moana shopping centre. It is surrounded by restaurants, so if you want to eat out it's easy to find something.The hotel looks like it was last decorated when the Brady Bunch were here but it is clean and the staff are wonderful, nothing is too much trouble (we had an air conditioner problem and within 20 mins maintainence was there to fix it;) , they remembered our names when we walked through the lobby. The kids received a backpack activity pack on arrival. This hotel is much smaller than the main ones, but this means that it feels like you are a person and not a number. The lobby has a small shop but it has irregular opening hours. There is a small cafe attached to it, but it is tiny and only open for breakfast and lunch (great food). It has a spa, a nice pool with banana lounges, and an activities desk.Overall, we were very happy with this hotel and would choose to stay here anytime in the future happily.","Melbourne, Victoria","skyecoote</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Victoria</strong>",124,5.0

We were very pleased on checking in to be upgraded to a two-bedroom unit, room 718. While it 'only' had a city view, the size and convenience more than made up for not having the teeny view of the ocean between the Trump tower and Hilton tower. Two spacious bedrooms, washer/dryer, full kitchen, two lanais and a huge open area that can't even be called a lanai made this a perfect long-duration stay. I've heard some complaints from previous travellers here about street noise - we live in a rural area and are used to sleeping in complete silence, but city noise doesn't bother us - it's part of the whole experience - if you want to escape it, stay high up on a beachfront condo - that's the only way you will. We loved the short walk through Fort DeRussy park to the widest part of the beach - barely 10 min - towels from the hotel if we needed, and yes, the fruit water in the lobby - my oldest son would fill up his water bottle with it before setting out each day. If you are a family/couple who has travelled a lot and are 'relaxed' travellers, this is the perfect place. The staff are all friendly and accommodating, rooms were always clean and comfortable, and if you're every grumpy about something, step outside - it's Hawai'i! Yes, valet parking is $25 a day, but that's standard everywhere in Honolulu, and given the cheap price of rentals if you book ahead, it balances out compared to other cities. Every evening we enjoyed the walk down Kalakaua Ave., and the Outrigger Luana is just the right distance away from the truly busy part of this great strip. Never ate in the restaurant as we ate breakfast in the room and usually would eat a late lunch/early dinner out, but it looked more than fine.

Each Outrigger is different, yet all three have the same lovely and calm atmosphere. Everything is nicely decorated and is kept clean and is very inviting. We would definitely go back to all three.  Location: The Outrigger Luana’s location is perfect. It is just a few walking blocks from Waikiki Beach, the Beach Walk with all its lovely shops and restaurants, the US Post Office, and is on the main street, Kalakaua Avenue. There are shops and restaurants right outside the Luana. Local buses run frequently on this street and you can take them everywhere, including to such places as the Bishop Museum and Iolani Palace. Yet, it is not a noisy street. There is a small park across the street, and of course, it is next to the beautiful Fort DeRussy Park. Staff: As you arrive, you are greeted and assisted by Luana staff, who is always on duty outside. Each time we entered or departed from the building, we were always cheerfully greeted and welcomed back. As you walk up the stairs from the street entrance, there is a lovely restaurant open 7:00 am – 2:00 pm. Then you walk into a charming lobby with just one small, yet cute shop, with a helpful shop keeper. The entire staff did its very best to make the stay a extremely pleasant stay. Room: We chose a room with a city view and it was perfect. Located on the first floor, the room is nicely decorated, and it had more than ample storage. As we walked into the room, the bathroom was on the right. On the left was a kitchen area with a sink and small refrigerator with a long counter top with cabinets above and several large drawers below. In addition, there was closet with cabinet space below, a lovely TV, a nice-sized desk, coffee table, couch and a king-size bed. Outside the room was a large, closed off concrete area with a view of the night city lights that is just breathtaking. You can, of course, close the curtains. The floors above have balconies. Facilities: Located on the first floor, we were near the laundry room, which was very clean and had several washers and dryers.

Considering the size of the Outrigger chain, they should have at least one coffee bean grinder on hand. Hawaiian coffee is highly advertised.The room was very large and comfortable.

They paid for the cab and sent us to the ghetto, there was a homeless man sleeping at the door of the new hotel. I was not happy, alongside our room was not even ready. Two hours later we made it back to the Luana, they upgraded us from a studio to a one bedroom partial ocean for the trouble. That was nice. The room was very nice and the beds super comfy, I slept on the pull out sofa bed and surprisingly it was comfy as well. They also have free wifi in the rooms and a free inroom safe that ended up being used more than I thought. The rooms are very spacious and provided a lot of room. Complaints: I am under 5ft tall and the shower head hit me in the chest, it was so short and not adjustable. They give you one coffee bag per day which is enough for one cup of coffee and they charge you for extra. Also, our sliding glass door to the lanai was extremely hard to open and didnt lock.All in all, I would probably stay here again, it is very conveniently located, you are in the middle of waikiki so you can walk easily to the mall, beach, fort derussy, pink trolley, etc. Also, they have the most delicious water in the lobby all day long with fresh fruits inside and they have a snack around 2pm.

As we had a 12 day stay, and also having had a night in a Honolulu airport hotel and 7 nights on Maui, we needed an economical place to stay, and this fitted the bill admirably.We chose a studio apartment so we could self cater and to cut costs, a city view room. We received a seniors' rate (50+), so were extremely happy with the cost. The view was not so good (the garage), but luckily we were on Floor 10, so had more of an outlook. The lanai was quite small, so we didn't use it. We had enough space in the room and more than enough equipment to self cater. We did discover that the extractor fan needed to be used even when making toast, and although small, we managed to fit in what we needed in the fridge.The pool area and the pool itself were both small, but chairs were always available and the water was warm. For shade, which my husband needs, you could either sit in one of the cabanas or drag a chair into a shady spot. My husband used the bike in the gym and was happy with that.I was a bit concerned about the position of the hotel, imagining it being miles from anywhere, but found this not to be the case. We walked to and from Ala Moana Mall, which took about 25 minutes, but is flat so not taxing (except when lugging home groceries and shopping). As for Waikiki itself, it's close to everything, and it's not far to the beach either. We only caught a bus once, to and from the Ward Centre, and the bus stop is close to the hotel.The front desk staff were always polite and helpful, and we organised 2 trips through Matt, the concierge, both of which were good. Our rooms were always cleaned well, but we did do our own dishes and disposed of a lot of our rubbish ourselves. I was surprised that towels were changed daily which, although nice, is not so common in hotels nowadays. As an environmental issue, I think they should actually change this and use the system that other hotels have to indicate when you'd like a towel change. Toiletries were of good quality and replenished when necessary.We had breakfast in our room most mornings, a few lunches and most dinners. We do like our food, but would rather save our money for shopping, which, along with some R&R, was the purpose of tnis trip. We actually got most of our groceries at Foodland, at Ala Moana, a much cheaper option with much greater variety than the ABC stores.I would recommend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a comfortable, economic option of Waikiki accommodation.","Kingsgrove, Australia","dragonlady2411</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kingsgrove, Australia</strong>",125,5.0

We had booked the room with Expedia several weeks in advance and felt that we had gotten excellent value for what we had paid. It was a walk to the beach, but you walk right along Kalakaua Ave. which has tons of shops and restaurants along it (so many of these restaurants are fantastic) and the walk wasn't far at all. Mind you, I did have to walk to the Sheraton Waikiki in heels for the wedding and I honestly didn't think that it was too far. Even my toes agree. :-)We had two queen beds, a small desk, TV, nightstand in the room as well as a kitchen sink which was great when two of us were trying to get ready for the wedding. Tile floors throughout made it easy for housekeeping to keep things clean. We didn't have a great view from our porch, but we had no loud noise and the porch was still really nice when we hung out there at the end of the day.There was $25/day valet parking that we needed to use that was pricey but seemed to be par for the course in the area. The attendants were really cool and attentive and always brought the car to us quickly. The front desk attendants were also great and gave us beach towels upon request. We only ate at the cafe at the hotel once, but the food was reasonably priced and tasty - it was also prepared super quickly and this was really important because we were running late for the wedding when we grabbed our lunch here.One small touch that I really loved was the complimentary water that they had in the lobby; there's a table to the side with ice water sitting there that has tons of tropical fruit in it to give it flavor. It really was a treat and was a great way to start a day of exploring; I'd grab a glass of it whenever I'd leave the hotel.","Washington, D.C.","SadLawGrad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, D.C.</strong>",16,5.0

Easily rivaled the 5 star hotels I've stayed at. The front desk staff made check in fast and smooth. The porter who carried our luggage to our room was friendly and talkative. The concierge was able to direct us to some amazing restaurants in the area. The room was cleaned to perfection on a daily basis, despite the fact we kept dragging in sand. Honestly, there isn't anything negative I could say.The location is prime, close to restaurants, shops and the beach. The restaurant attached has great breakfast, you should definitely try the crab cakes eggs benedict. They provide beach towels, which are always available at the front desk. And bonus: they had laundry facilities on the second floor, open 24 hours. Which was great, as I was going to Japan afterwards for 12 days and really needed to do some laundry.They set up airport transportion for me when I left, which was only $12 (compared to the $35 spent on a cab on the way in).

All of the staff was friendly. We were upgraded to a room with a kitchenette which included stove, fridge, microwave, toaster, coffee maker with coffee, tea, sugar and cream and all of the necessary kitchen utensils and plates and cutlery. The bathroom has hairdryer (not very strong) soap, lotion, shampoo,and conditioner. I loved the the soaps and shampoo and conditioner it smelled soooo good it has a pikake flower fragrance but its not overwhelming. The room was clean it had 1 bed and a pullout couch. The tv was flatscreen. The lanai overlooked the Kalakaua statue and the waikiki strip. There is a small cafe downstairs, Protea. open 7am to 2pm and they offer happy hour 11-2 we I ordered breakfast and took it back to the room. They also have a bbq area, gym and pool. (we didn't use any) The hotel is a close walk to everything. The furthest we walked was to Waikiki Walls, the beach near Kapiolani Park, with no problem because we were there to enjoy everything we took our time and didn't rush. Ft Derussy Beach is also right across the street from the hotel too if you don't feel like walking that far to the beach. There are lots of restaurants from pricey to budget nearby. The Royal Hawaiian shopping center has a food court inside. On Lewers street there's everything from Ruth Cris, Yard House, Giovanni Pastrami, and Subway plus more. We had a late lunch at Hard Rock Cafe on Beachwalk super close to the hotel. They have happy hour almost all day till 7pm and also a live band (check the schedule I don't think its every night) we sat at the bar and the bartender Patrick is super cool! Lots of shopping but ala moana shopping is nearby too but I wouldn't walk there. If you have a long stay. There's also Sam's Club and Wal-mart nearby you can get some goods from there and not pay ""waikiki"" prices. There's also a small bar right across the street from the hotel called Bambooze. We only discovered it as we were walking back to our hotel late one night. They have a pool table, and darts also drink specials there too. The only gripe I(we) had was there's road construction going on (not the hotels fault )and there were steel plates on the street so EVERY car that passed over it we could hear the loud ""Ka-Donk Ka-Donk"" even though the lanai door was shut. I had the A/C on full blast to drown the noise (but I like the A/C on full blast anyway). A few shots of whiskey also helps drown the noise, so says my husband. Other than that noise everything was pretty quiet. It won't last forever so don't let that discourage you.

It is a quick 5 minute walk to the main shopping strip in Waikiki, making it a little quieter; without the throngs of people milling about outside the entrance.It is also a short walk (7-10 minutes) to the beach near the Kale Hoa Hotel. This beach is quieter than Waikiki beach, I imagine in part because it is not a sandy entry into the water, it is a little more rocky.If you want shopping there are two terrific choices: 1. The main strip on Kalakaua Avenue which offers various ABC Stores, touristy, souvenir boutiques and other higher end stores like Tiffany's, Hermes etc.2. you can choose to go to the Ala Moana Shopping Center (15-20 minute walk), a rather large, outdoor center which offers a vast array of shopping choices, as well as dining.Directly behind the hotel is an open air park, Fort DeRussy, which provides a nice area for strolling.A nice touch that the hotel provided in the lobby was self-serve Spa Water. It was available from the morning throughout until supper time. It was flavored with pineapple, strawberries, cucumbers. It was very refreshing and we looked forward to it daily after our long walks, exploring the immediate area.THE DREADFUL CONCIERGE:My one, and only, dealing with this service.At 8:30 am one morning I stood behind a woman who was asking directions to Diamond Head. She was given very thorough instructions as to where to catch the bus and was offered other various unsolicited information. That made me quite pleased as I was hoping to be equally informed about my destination.I was going to Pearl Harbor and asked about the bus system. She said it would take me about 1.5 hours and she did not offer any other information. When I then asked if a shuttle was available she said there was one and pointed outside saying that I needed to talk with the valet to arrange that. Once again, no other information was being offered. I proceeded to ask if there was an advantage to taking the shuttle over the bus...she reiterated that the bus would take much longer than the shuttle and that I'd be better off taking the shuttle. She basically brushed me off.The total shuttle cost $16 per person, return, (we were two) and was quite flexible for pick-up times.Upon arriving at Pearl Harbor (9:30 am) I learned three things:1. If you don't arrive by 8 am or don't purchase your tickets online, you'll likely not get tickets to the Arizona as they are sold out.2. You are not allowed to bring a bag (back-pack, purse, etc.) into the venue.3. It costs $3 to check your bag into the manned storage facility.My utter disappointment with the concierge was that she should have, at the very least, told me the 3 issues listed above. I learned from my very helpful shuttle driver upon return that the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet, Hawaii's largest open air flea market, open on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, had been a mere 5 minute walk from Pearl Harbor. That would have been helpful to know from the concierge as well.She was an utter disappointment and the hotel's complete lack of desire to rectify a situation that, in my opinion, reflected on their hotel was a let down. They dropped the ball in that respect.","Colorado Springs, Colorado","ExPat_from_Canada</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colorado Springs, Colorado</strong>",59,2.0

When traveling, you have to be realistic and if you are a reasonable, normal human being, you realize this hotel goes above and beyond. After searching the internet and reading all of the reviews for hotels in Waikiki, I booked a week vacation at the Outrigger Luana. I was hesitant due to the price being so much less than a lot of the other hotels in the same vicinity, but all of the reviews for this place were so positive. After getting there and the warm welcome we received from the staff, I felt very good about my decision. My best friend was traveling with me and he is a little more picky about places than I am, but he kept telling me what a good job I did choosing the hotel. He is very travel savvy and always wants a good deal. The rooms are not lavish, but very comfortable. We had a fantastic partial ocean view from the 14th floor and could see all the lights from the city at night. I had requested partial ocean view when booking and the view did not disappoint. The entire staff was so accomodating and friendly. They really try very hard to fill all requests and that cannot be easy to please a bunch of traveling tourists. The parking situation may not be ideal for some travelers who are not used to such a lack of parking in a city, but Ifeel that the valet only system the hotel has in place is very secure and convenient for guests. The $25 a day is well worth it for piece of mind and ease of use. (We met other people who had been towed when trying to self park at other hotels) They always have a smiling, friendly valet out front to get your car very quickly. With our flight leaving late at night the last day, I was able to go to the beach after checking out and come back to the hotel to change clothes, shower, and get ready to leave. They have bathrooms with showers in the pool area and the bell hops keep your luggage locked up for you so you can enjoy your last day there. They never seemed irritated, even though I kept getting my bags out and then having them put them back up. I will definitely go back to this hotel next time I am in Honolulu!

Ryan told us they were booked solid & did not do late check outs & as they were booked up could not do a half day rental. We also asked for a quiet room as I suffer from migraines & if I happened to get one, we needed a quiet space. BUT as they were booked solid we had to take what they had, room 109....what a terrible room. It is right by the elevator & near the laundry room so you clearly hear all the comings & goings & the pop machine, which every time, when started up sounded like a jet engine, great when you are trying to sleep. The air conditioner was awful as well, again like a jet engine taking off. House keeping was hard to come by. We had to call up to have our room cleaned. They also didn't seem to like to leave soaps etc each time. There was a yellow stain on the bathroom wall....never cleaned off... We were kept up one night by very loud partying, thank-fully that was only one night. Regarding parking, we parked for one day. We told the front staff that we no longer had a car & what needs to be done. We were advised, nothing. Upon check out they tried to charge us for 4 days & then the gentleman which whom we spoke to, it seemed tried to blame us...On our last day we decided to ask a different front staff about the late check outs, seems that yes, they do have them AND do half day rentals. I searched the internet & it seemed that Ryan was full of.....they had lots of rooms for rent. We would have paid to upgraded to a better floor/room when we checked in but were told wrong info.

But there are so many places close buy, 3 to 5 minute walk from this hotel, specially on Lewers Street (lots places to eat on either side,north or south, of Kalakaua Ave.) I know some people complained about street noise, I didn't find that a problem and I am a light sleeper. Also the rooms have a small balcony with two chairs & a little table. Nice to have a cup coffee in the morning and a drink in the evening. I also found the staff to be very helpfull and pleasant. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Also wanted to mention that there are lots of bus stops close by, and a really reasonable car rental place across the street from this hotel (I think it is called Thrifty rentals).

The room is pretty big. It's bigger than the one I had at Hyatt Regency. The location is great. it's on the quieter side of Kalakaua. But only mins away from the shopping district and restaurants. If you are going to surf don't choose this hotel. it's very far away from the beach. So you don't want to carry your huge surf board and walk half hour back to the hotel.The bad things, the internet is extremely slow and unstable. when it works it's fast enough to browse but when it's acting up, it's annoying. the hotel is right next to a gas station which can be very noisy with all the sport cars and motorcycles showing off especially if your room was right next to it.

However, considering its location about 10 minutes to the beach and 5 minutes to high-end shopping and restaurants, the price makes the Luana a good value. The rooms and the hotel were clean, the staff friendly and helpful, and our room had a kitchenette with a small fridge, and plates, cups, and utensils, but no stove or microwave. We originally selected this hotel based on perceived value and though there is no direct beach access, or sweeping views from your room, the location is right at the edge of the action giving us what we wanted: access to the action, but just far enough to not get swept up in it. For value minded travelers, I would recommend this hotel.",California,"bchotpotato</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",49,3.0

The staff was friendly and accommodating the activities desk is very helpful and knowledgeable about things to do. The pool is very small, but who needs the pool when you have the beach right behind you. I only went to the pool to lay out and tan one day when I was too lazy to take the 5 minute walk to the beach. The fitness center is also decent.

There is also a reception area on the 2nd floor which has different events-wine tastings... Also it is a 10 minute walk to Waikiki beach and right along the main strip close to lots of great shopping and restaurants! I went for nightly walks and discovered so many great places [Cheescake Factory, Ala Moana Center [the largest open air mall in the world] , Keos thai restaurant, and my favourite Italian restaurant Arancino- lobster to die for! Very high energy!! I walked through all the hotels around the city. Gorgeous gardens in the Hilton Hawiian Village with flamingoes, turtles, parrots, koi fish, penguins! Great prices for what you get! The front desk is very helpful and if you plan on extra activities its cheaper to book through this hotel. we did the North Shore shark cage diving as well as the dolphin/snorkelling catamaran tour. Both were amazing and picked us up in a shuttle and drove us back for an xtra fee.

The fridge was a great size, even though we didn't need to use it. The coffee and tea selections were adequate; a few herbal tea options would have been a nice touch. The size of shampoo and conditioner provided were generous.Front counter staff were all pleasant. Could have done with a few more smiles, but we managed to elicit a few after the initial greeting.All in all, a good value experience.

The views from this hotel are really great in that it overlooks Fort Derussy Park; some rooms would include an ocean view. The bed was the most comfortable one we've experienced in our travels. While we hadn't requested a suite with full kitchen, we were pleased to be provided with a fridge, toaster, dishes, cuttlery and coffee maker but no cooking facility. The kitchen and bath areas had granite countertops and marble surrounds. TV was a flat screen model. The lanai was rather small and there was a bit of a problem aligning the locks on the lanai door. There is a guest laundry area. The pool lounges had comfy mattresses on them. Now for the negatives: the pool is too cool, which is becoming an annoying complaint of visitors to Hawaii. The other concern is bus service could be more conveniently located. All in all, I'd recommend the Outrigger Luana based primarily on the hotel itself and it's picturesque location in Waikiki.","Chilliwack, BC","BCChilly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chilliwack, BC</strong>",41,4.0

The good: big fridge, LCD tv, iPod dock and an OK view. The bad:a double bed mattress seemed very old as we both felt like we were sinking into the bed and no we are not obese. We had uncomfortable sleepless nights and the streets were noisy we lost count how many times you could hear police sirens going off? The gym is fairly average air-con keeps going off so you had to keep to turning it on and the equipment is pretty average. The front desk staff are pretty dull and not as friendly as you expect them to be. The bell men at front are very nice and chatty though :) always saying hello they make up for bad service at front. Only one shop that's overpriced inside. 2 computers to share amongst all guest :(. In the bathroom you can't bloody turn the taps you will see what I mean if you go to luana.

For those people wondering if this is the place for you, it is if you want a nice place (but not 4 or 5 star luxury - think holiday Inn Express without breakfast) close (but not in) to all the real bustle. Hotel is on the main street for action in Waikiki about a 5 minute walk to the start of all the fancy shops (Coach, Juicy, Apple etc, etc - warning guys, there is lots and lots of shopping). the area is not scary and the only (well dressed) hookers we saw were right near the International Village. By the way, if anyone thinks Waikiki is second rate or that Oahu isnt a desirable destination let me help you out. Its awesome. Fab beaches, lovely people, good prices, terrific sites. Its clean (almost no litter) safe and did i mention those beaches?Ok back to the review. Room we had was nice - tile floor, queen bed, roomy kitchenette with bar fridge/freezer (very roomy - we found out why - these places are individually owned and then rented out under mgmt contract) with a small but servicable balcony and much needed a/c. the street is noisy at night but with the door closed and the ac on, it didnt matter.Pool area is smaller but certainly in scale with the hotel and with a nice sunning lounging area but we never used it. I mean have you seen Waikiki beach? Its awesome and only a 10 minite walk through the park. Didnt try the restaurant but others did and said it was fine. There was a coupon for 15% off in the little book we got at check in.Ok so if you are a value traveller with taste (and you know who you are, dont you?) go ahead and book this place. If we had bought this on priceline or hotwire it would be in the 3 to 3.5 star category.Money saving tips. the parking is high - 25 bucks per day and its valet so you gotta tip. Dont bother searching for options (like i did). If you have a car you will be parking it here. So, what to do? If you are on a really tight budget, get a bus or cab here and get around the town and island by bus. Or rent a car a day at a time for say two days of your visit. There is a rental place (Dollar) across the street and just rent it for the day and return it back that night. Do that for a couple days to tour the island and you are good as gold.Happy hours are great and oh so cheap. We had drinks/dinner at the Shereton Rumfire a couple nights. Its great and right on the water with free (and good) music. You should go! Dukes at the outrigger was also terrific and we went to the Kona brewery pub and the beer and natchos were top drawer. Its out of town a bit so you would need to drive. Also, you will want to put a few cold ones and some fruit and snacks in that handy kitchen. you could go to one of the many, many ABC stores and pay a lot - but does that sound like us? Nope, we found a local grocery store (a real one - safeway size) called the food pantry right in the thick of Waikiki and walked over there each day or so for supplies. its about a 10-15 minute walk away through interesting and non-scary streets. Its open until 1 am and the address is 2370 Kuhio Avenue which is on a road that starts across the street from the hotel. You must buy some pinappple - its out of this world.Also, sign up for Groupons and living social deals for Honolulu a couple months before your trip. We did and got some good deals on outings in particular a 90 minute catameran harbour sail for 10 bucks each. It was fun and the drinks were only 3 bucks each and left for in front of the Shereton.We walked up Diamond Head, drove to the North shore and Leeward coast and toured the Royal Palace free music Friday from the Royal orchastra. All terrific. Driving is fine, by the way. Drivers are courtious and the speeds are moderate. Get a decent map and you will be fine. Much better/nicer driving than any big mainland US city. There is a 700 booth swap meet at Aloha stadium a couple days each week and free fireworks friday night on the beach at 7.30 in front of the shereton. So, in summary, a great value hotel in a good location in a fantastic place. there are many places fancier but we will come back here. As for Wakiki and Oahu, youve made a great choice.

The parking staff is very helpful, and though there is a daily charge it is no higher than the standard fee, and you have in and out privileges. The cafe on the front of the hotel serves a nice breakfast and lunch and is like the rest of the hotel friendly and clean.

Room: We had a studio with kitchen on the 6th floor. The room was very clean, the bathroom spotless, the king-size bed comfortable, and there was a flat screen cable TV. The kitchen had a small fridge, microwave oven and electric burners, a toaster and coffee maker, so we were able to cook some meals. There was a fee to use the internet in the room, although there is free wireless in the lobby and in the pool area. The daily local newspaper was free for the taking.The room had a balcony, which looked out on the small triangle park at the Kalakaua/Kuhio split (King David Kalakaua statue), and has a (somewhat obscured by other hotels) view of the mountains and the city. I watched the MLK parade from the balcony. The drawback of this room location is the street noise, so we could not sleep with an open balcony door and had to resort to using A/C. With the door closed, it was very quiet, but the A/C was loud. Next time I will request a room on the backside of the hotel. Amenities:The outdoor pool is on the first floor and was never crowded when I was there. There is no jacuzzi, but a nice sundeck with a BBQ pit that guests can use. There is also a nice fitness center by the pool.Service: Everyone at the Luana was very helpful and friendly, from the desk clerks and valet parking to the housekeeping personnel. I can't say enough about this, as this is not always the case in Waikiki hotels.Location: As other posters have already mentioned, the hotel is not smack dab in the middle of the bustling Waikiki tourist strip but a few minutes' walk from it. It is also not by the beach, which is a 5-10 minute walk (depending on one's pace) through the Fort de Russy park right behind the Luana. My husband had an easy 10 minute walk to his conference at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It is also less than a mile from the Ala Moana shopping mall, also an easy walk. The Bus stop is across from the hotel on Kuhio St, and route # 2 takes you not only to Ala Moana mall but to some of the tourist attractions like the Iolani Palace and Kamehameha statue.

The hotel is not a new property, but was very clean and well kept. We liked the style. The staff were always friendly and helpful. The location was at one end of the Waikiki strip, which was nice, as slightly less touristy than many other Waikiki locations, and only about 3-4 blocks from the beach.The 2-person room was large enough to not be cramped, and the bed was better than 90+% of the hundreds of hotel beds I have slept in. The rooftop pool/patio area (about 2 floors above street level) were nice, clean, and well kept; they were also kid friendly. We enjoyed the use of the (free) barbecue grill. We bought food several times at the Food Pantry market about 7 blocks from the hotel, and were able to eat well and (relative to eating out) cheaply. Note - bring food from home - Hawaii caused sticker shock for us small-town US midwesterners. If we come again, we'll bring less clothes and more food! The in-room refridgerator was large enough to be really useful. We were able to save on breakfast by using hot water from the coffee maker to make instant oatmeal. The staff were helpful and used their microwave for us on a couple of occasions.One negative I found - the hotel was rather noisy in the early morning a few days, which made sleeping after 7 am a challenge.Bottom line - we found the Outrigger Luana to be a pretty nice spot and a great value.

This time I was on my own nickel and looking for a hotel with the best balance of quality, convenience, and (relatively) low price. I read a lot of reviews before choosing the Outrigger Luana. The mostly very good reviews have proved accurate. The recent reference to ""underrated gem"" is a good one IMO. If you're looking for a big, flashy, new hotel, go elsewhere. From its small lobby to modest rooms, it won't wow you. But if you want to save a few bucks while staying in perfectly nice accomodations in a good location, choose Luana. Trying to picture the location before I got here, I was pleasantly surprised how close it really is to the stores and restaurants --the high-end Kalakaua strip begins just 1 1/2 blocks away. On the other hand, while you are on the ocean side of Kalakaua and do not have to cross a street to get to the beach, it is a good though pleasant 10 minute walk thru Fort DeRussey Park to get there. Even though I am in a corner room on the first floor (which is 2 floors above the ground) and facing the street I have not been bothered by noise. An unexpected benefit of what might seem a bad room selection is that the first floor rooms have larger, more private balconies. The handy kitchenettes in the room make for very convenient sun-bathing - just pop in and grab something to eat or drink.","Wilmington, Delaware","MidAtlanticSteve</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wilmington, Delaware</strong>",20,5.0

I read the reviews on Tripadvisor and spoke with our travel agent, and she also recommended the Ourtrigger Luana Waikiki as it many of the features that we were looking for, such as a kitchen to prepare some quick meals, close enough to the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, but far enough away that we wouldn't be kept up all night long due to noise, and the price was more than affordable.Upon arrival, we were greeted by the friendly bell hop/valet. We weren't sure if we were going to be able to check in early, as we had arrived about 4 hours prior to check-in time, but were very pleased when we immediately were given our room keys. Our 8th floor, studio partial-ocean view condo was very nice and clean. The view overlooking Fort DeRussy Beach Park towards the Pacific Ocean was absolutely beautiful. Our only small complaint of our room was that the air conditioning unit was a little loud, but I wouldn't have traded it for the world as it kept the room cool, even in the 38°C heat (corrected for humidity).We visited the concierge, Angela, who was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in giving us advice for places to eat and booking us on some amazing tours. We were even able to book a few tours through her for our following week on Maui, as she was originally from the island, so she had a vast amount of knowledge on what to do and see there.The restaurant, Protea Cafe, located just outside the lobby entrance, was excellent for a quick breakfast. They are only open for breakfast and lunch (7am to 2pm). There is not a lot of seating, but it was nice to be able to sit and chat with likewise travellers at the over-sized common table, or at one of the handful of other tables.

Although not a resort in any way, I found the Waikiki location (the end of luxury row) to be truly ideal. Luana is situated on a quiet but extremely safe block of the main thoroughfare Kalakaua Avenue, adjacent to the very well kept and lovely Fort DeRussy Park. It is important to note that one of Waikiki""s dirty secrets is the sheer number of prostitutes lining the main streets beginning at 9pm nightly. This is particularly odd as the high end shopping (Cartier, etc) is open until about 11 pm. So it is quite conceivable that you will come strolling out of a luxury boutique with your signifigant other and happen upon an unsavory transaction. While more luxe than the humble Luana, the Moana Surfrider and Grand Hyatt suffer from a problem of agressive streetwalkers hovering about their entrance.. The Luana doesn't have this problem, so that is a plus, and sadly a rarity in Waikiki. Now onto the rooms themselves, I personally enjoy the signature Outrigger aesthetic, full of islands theme lamps etc, after all, I want to feel like I'm in Hawaii. What I did not enjoy about the rooms were the small bathrooms and bathtubs. Also I found it bizarre that there was a fully equipped kitchenette, with no microwave or burner. The beds were quite comfortable, and housekeeping was thorough.Lastly, I must talk about the customer service. Moat of the front desk staff were helpful (particularly John who works late night). However the worst service that I received during my entire stay in all of Hawaii was from Lily Tran, the gratuitously nasty front desk manager. Once, she brutally scolded me when I asked for directions, shocking both me and my fiance, and on my last day she was again rude and unhelpful. I suppose I am not alone, as ive noticed that several other recent TripAdvisor reviews have been unimpressed with Luana management. I personally hope that company promotes the gentle John while retraining the sarcastic and mean Ms.Tran in the art of customer service (or at least common manners ).Summing up, one rude employee would not turn me off from staying here. Although if money is no issue, then I also recommend the Kahala for the finest that Honolulu has to offer.",,nycpanther,11,5.0

We can also see the ocean, only 5 mins or less walking distance.. The hotel has a little pool and gym area. Free wifi is really a big bonus since some hotels charge you.

Altho yeh, I hear garbage trucks and buses starting to pass by earlier than my waking hours but hey it's Hawaii, wake up early and enjoy the morning sun and clear water! So I didn't let it bother me. During the last day, our trip coming home was still at 8:30pm so they were nice enough to inform us that if we get tired before then, we can stay at their mezzanine and relax in their comfy chairs watching shows in their big screen tv, which we did and I even doze a little bit :-) our luggage was left in their concierge so we don't have to carry them while waiting for the time. And yes, they also told us if ever we need to take a bath during those times after check out, we can always use their bathroom by the pool.. Very accommodating indeed! It seems that they know that there are really people who's return flights are even later than their check out, so they came up with this option :-) We took a taxi going to the airport, costing $33 and we just gave tip as well. We rented a car overnight, and since the hotel charges $25 for parking, and because one of the helpful reviews here said there's a $5 place for overnight parking in a post office near this hotel, we looked for it and to our great surprise it's just almost behind the hotel , which is like 2 mins walk :-) all in all, I'll come back to this hotel if given a chance and yes, I'd recommend it to others as long as the good service I got will not change and if not, even better :-)",las vegas,"lyks2travel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>las vegas</strong>",22,4.0

It is several blocks out of the mainstream, which can be a blessing in terms of much less street noise. If you have to be in the middle of everything right outside the door, this is out of the way. Leo's Asian restaurant is right across the street and the Luana now has a little restaurant right outside the lobby instead of a coffee stand. Opens for breakfast at 6:00. Hotel has a nicely done workout room and pool area. The hotel facade not have a fancy facade so you might not notice it but it is a gem. The staff are universally pleasant and helpful. I have stayed here for business but I would choose this for a family vacation. This is not a big, bustling place just a smallish oasis near but not in the chaos of Waikiki.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Nancy33208</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",47,5.0

The service was excellent mainly because the valet folks were so helpful and nice. Each time a valet attendant brought your car from the garage, the attendant would ask if you need help with directions or need recommendations on places to eat or hang out. The attendant would always give you a smile unlike some other hotels where they just wait for you to get out of your car. What really needed improvement was the house cleaning. On the first day, we had received nice bottles of lotion, shampoo, body wash, and actual kleenex. After the first night, the house cleaning staff refilled with generic bottles. Instead of kleenex, housekeeping gave us a roll of toilet paper in its place. I wish there was more consistency instead of downgraded goods. The beds were neatly made, but I would have to make the extra effort to ask for the same goods or else I would be downgraded on goods. The location is nice. A good 10 - 15 minute walking time to the International Marketplace. The beach is not far. It is also a 10 - 15 minute walk.

I booked it based in part on them and I was thoroughly disappointed.The room looked and felt dirty. During my one week stay, there were pillow stains almost everyday - including dried blood. A cockroach was found in the bathroom in addition to at least two other unidentifiable bugs. Stains were also on the sofa, chairs, and window curtains. Although the room has a ""kitchenette"", it didn't even have a microwave. The air conditioning unit did its job well but it was also loud which made it hard to sleep. It did, however, drown out the loud traffic noise coming from outside.Service at the hotel was appropriate but at times it was cold and certainly nothing special like others have raved about. I was told parking is by valet only and it's expensive. You're better off parking somewhere else and then walking back to the hotel. The location isn't bad as it's on the cusp of Waikiki but there's no direct beach access.My advice? Do yourself a favour, pay a little more, and get a better hotel somewhere farther down Kalakaua Avenue inside Waikiki proper. I left Hawaii feeling cheated.

This was my first experience with an Outrigger property and I was not impressed. I called about 4 times to confirm the availability of a room with 2 double beds and a pull out couch because I was travelling with friends. On all 4 calls, they said this was a room type, but could not guarantee that we would be assigned this. When we got there I was at first pleased that we were assigned to a room with 2 double beds. Later I found out that we were assigned to a room with 2 double beds, but the couch did not pull out into a bed. After my multiple calls, I was so disappointed that they did not inform me that this was an option too. I had researched hotels for days before selecting one and multiple hotels had 2 double beds. It was the pull out couch (=3 beds) that made this hotel unique and made my decision. So, I asked at the front desk if it would be possible to provide a roll-away bed to make up for the ""one room in the hotel that has 2 double beds, but no pull-out couch"". Not only were they not willing to do this without cost, they were rude about how they handled it repeatedly asking- ""i could give you a room with a king size bed and a pull out couch. Would you like me to do that?"" threatening as if the whole point was lost on them. Although I knew the room type was not guaranteed, I was misinformed because I had called to check on the types of rooms multiple times. The customer CARE just wasn't there.Also, beware of the attached restaurant, one of my travel companions saw multiple bugs near the creamer/sugar while going to get coffee one morning.","Royal Oak, Michigan","Bluemouth8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Royal Oak, Michigan</strong>",7,1.0

(First time was our honeymoon, 22 years ago.) We were really pleased with our choice to stay at Outrigger Luana. It is a smaller hotel which gives it a more personal feel. Now, after being home for nearly a month, we often think about the friendly staff who always seemed genuinely happy to see us coming and going on our daily outings. They were kind hearted, helpful, & interested in our adventures but very respectful of our privacy. In all our travels we have never felt so at home as we did at the Outrigger Luana.During our 14 night stay, we were able to experience 3 different rooms, all with kitchenettes. The first night we were facing the main street which was a nice view but a little bit noisy and no view of the ocean. On the second night we moved to a room facing Honolulu. From our balcony we could see the pool and a little of the park and ocean. This room was somewhat quieter and we really had no complaints. Being the curious travellers that we are, we wondered what the rooms across the hall were like and asked if we could be moved to one if one came available. Well, that was the best room of all! We now had a beautiful view of Waikiki, Diamond Head, Fort DeRussy Park and the ocean! In the morning, we watched the sun come up and we would have our coffee and breakfast on the Lanai while listening to the birds and watching the people do Tai Chi in the park. The free newspaper was always just outside the door by the elevator. The free in-room internet was an added bonus. We were able to look up information on places to see, things to do, where to eat etc.On the first floor, above the lobby and mezzanine, there is the pool, gym, outdoor BBQ area, laundry and ice. The gym is fantastic and surprisingly, has more than just the basics. Also, it has a nice view looking out to the pool area.On the main floor (lobby) there is a business area with two Apple computers and a printer (no extra charge). A small gift shop is also available. The mezzanine has a spa where guests can go for luxurious pampering. Hotel guests get special rates on most services. There are also several sitting areas and a large flatscreen TV. At the hotel entrance is the Protea restaurant which is a great place to have breakfast, lunch or grab a quick snack.Clean beach towels are provided daily at the front desk. Free coffee is provided only on the first day of stay, after which you can purchase more for $1 ea. at the front desk. Kitchenette came with microwave/convection oven, counter-top stove, small fridge, cookware and eating utensils. Frying pans & spatulas were all well-used in the rooms we were in. Beds were very comfortable and extra pillows are provided. Every room has a safe. Flat-screen TV, tile floor and granite counters throughout.Great location, 5-10 minute walk through beautiful park to beach. One mile walk to Ala Moana Shopping Center (Walmart & Ross just behind). ABC convenience store across the street from hotel. Eggs & Things restaurant on Saratogo across from post office offers beautiful omelettes, and amazing pancakes! LOVE the coconut syrup! At the nearby Fort DeRussy Beach, the Hale Koa Hotel (military) has excellent Mai Tai's for $3.50 during happy hour. Sit back, watch the sunset and listen to live music while doing some people watching. On Friday nights, there are spectacular fireworks. Awesome! Also the nearby Outrigger Reef Hotel's Shorebird Restaurant has a Sunset Special 4-5:30pm. It is a 1/2 pound choice sirloin with all you can eat salad bar for $14.95. After 9:30 pm there is Karaoke and drink specials. The only complaint we had was the $25 a day valet parking fee. It cost us just as much to park out car as it did to rent it. Don't rent from across the street or anywhere in Waikiki. Rent ahead of time with hotwire.com. $20 a day versus $90. Overnight parking is available at the nearby post office for $5 until 6 am. Nearby Fort DeRussy also has parking available at a reduced rate for longer usage.

The hotel is essentially in the middle of a park, and we had a nice view up toward Fort DeRussy. The pool area is small but immaculately well maintained and -- in early May, anyway -- never overcrowded.The staff in the lobby could not have been nicer, and the whole place just feels like a condo, without a lot of people passing through.

We chose this hotel based on the price and location. We didn’t need to be “on the beach” because we were cruising for the next 2 weeks.The positives: The price. Good for Waikiki.Nice big room with a little tableWe requested an upper floor and received the 14th. Happy to be above the noise of the “strip” because our partial oceanview actually looked right over the busy street. The location was great…a pleasant walk through Ft. DeRussy Park to Waikiki Beach and picnic tables where we ate breakfast (fruit from Henry’s Place). The valets were fantastic. Personable, efficient and friendly and gave great advice on where to go. We loved them. Happy guys enjoying their job. The only employess that treated us like guests.The negative: The front desk staff and manager (with the exception of John) were condescending to the point of being rude. Since parking had gone from $10 to $25/day when we made our reservations, we were perturbed and they did negotiate a compromise, but VERY reluctantly and after that they treated us with indifference and disdain. And then when we inquired as to why we had to buy those little coffee packets (1st one is complimentary the 1st day only) the 2nd and 3rd days for $1.00 ea., they were indignant. “That is how we keep our prices down!” But housekeeping continued to give us new towels despite us hanging them up to say we would use them again. Doesn’t add up…for $1.00 come on…We had a partial oceanview room that looked over the “strip” but we could see some water. Would’ve liked to have seen more park and less traffic.It is no smoking but someone chain-smoked on their balcony so our balcony use was very limited.It would have been nice to have a microwave in the room (did not reserve a kitchenette which we should have) and a coffee maker that doesn’t require those little packets. We brought good coffee along but had to buy those little packets of sub-par coffee..We would recommend this only if the facts are known as to what to expect.","Chicago, Illinois","catsforkids</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",237,3.0

Our room faced the strip, but was quiet, as it was near the Fort Russy end of the building. Our lanai was large, but the walls were high so we had a hard time seeing out if we were sitting. Someone from a floor above us kept spitting out their gum which landed on our lanai, a little annoying. The room was great, large, clean, and nicely appointed. The cleaning staff are fabulous. All staff great. The laundry, and ice machine were across from us, thought it would be noisy, but it was quiet and handy to have there. The pool was on our floor, along with the excerise room. We didn't rent a car because of the great bus service. We knew about the expense of parking.There is a restaurant on he looby floor and is pretty good and priced right.

The room was very clean and modern. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The housekeeping staff were great. I think we had the most positive experience with the valets. These guys were fantastic with advice anywhere from places to swim (or not) to places to eat and everything in between. The hotel sits on the edge of Fort Derussy in Honolulu. It's a few minutes pleasant walk to Waikiki beach and it's right on the main avenue that runs parallel with the beach so if you want to find lots of shops and restaurants then you are only minutes away from that as well. Now the Cons - Our car rental for ten days was $220 US. To park the car at the hotel for 10 days was $250. Also...their website says $20/day for parking as of 10 seconds ago yet we were charged $25/day. We forgot to talk to them about that when we paid up. I will try and resolve that from home. Wish me luck. We wanted a kitchenette and by mistake my wife did not book that type of room. She phoned back when she realized her mistake and the person she spoke with said no problem just upgrade when you get here. When we arrived in Honolulu the hotel was booked and we had no upgrade possible. The air conditioner was a little on the noisy side but then I find that with most hotel AC units.

We found this hotel to be quite nice as we had a kitchenette; microwave, fridge and 2 burner stove. It was a bit noisy having our room overlooking the main roadway, probably would have been better on the park side.However, it was close to buses, shops, 2 blocks to beach through the Fort DeRussey Park, which is beautiful.To get around by city bus is very easy. The hotel gave us a map and on the reverse side was attractions to go to by bus. Follow the bus #'s and no problem at all. The bus drivers are also very helpful. You just ask which bus to take to get to say, the Dole Plantation and they advise you the best route to take.We walked from this hotel to the Diamond Head Crater, which is quite a walk I might say, but if you are not in a hurry, nice way to see a lots of things. When you get to the crater, it is $1 for admission; take lots of water, good walking shoes and a hat. The terrain is uneven and the stairs are steep, but when at the top the view is breathtaking.The Dole Plantation is also very nice. Free to get in to the gift shop where you can get the Dole Whip, (cannot miss that). There is a train to take you around the plantation, maze and garden (at a cost). Pearl Harbour: get there early. We left at 6AM by City Bus (check the schedule on the back of the map given to you by the hotel) and we got to Pearl Harbour around 8AM. They give out times for the theatre and then you take a boat over to the Arizona Memorial. This is free. If you want to go on the Bowfin sub there is a cost. Well worth the trip to Pearl Harbour. From there you can take the City Bus up to the Dole Plantation which is only about another 20 mins.Bus passes are $25 for 4 days and if you are doing a lot of sightseeing, well worth it as you don't have to make sure you have the correct change.There is also the Circle Island Bus where you can take it all the way around the Island, or stop off at the North Shore beaches. We stopped at the Waimea Valley Audobon (cost to get in) $13 for adults and $6 for seniors over 60+. The waterfall there is nice and if there is a lifeguard on duty you can swim in the lagoon.Also, went to Chinatown and if you like seafood and are cooking in your room, seafood is very inexpensive. We bought a 1/2 bag of shrimp for $9.Also, on Thurs nights beside the hotel is a small market. There you can get small lobster tails, produce, etc. On Tues, Thurs, Sat, Sun down Kalakua Ave. by the big Banyan tree (about 6 blocks towards Diamond Head) at 6:30-7:30 there is a free hula show.Overall, I would recommend this hotel as it is close to the beach, transportation and eateries.

But what truely inpressed me was the staff. Everyone was great, but especially the bell boy Jacob. We were not even off the shuttle bus and he was waiting for us. I had the opportunity to see him in action the next day while waiting for my shuttle and I have never seen someone go so above and beong for customers.

Our room was only on the second floor and it overlooked the back end of the gas station next door. Having said this it is the only hotel on the park grounds and is a short way (a few blocks) from Central Waikiki. I think the location is great as its not so noisy and its the only hotel on the park property. As long as the sliding doors are kept closed the noise is very limited from the outside and as we were located close to the back side of the hotel we didn't get too much of the main street traffic.The lobby is beautiful and we thought the staff, both in and out, were very pleasant.The elevators could be a problem as we had some lengthy waits for them and unfortunately we couldn't find stairs to get to the second floor so we had to use the elevator. There must be stairs down from the first floor to the lobby but we could only find stairs down to the first floor from the second. These stairs also take you to the pool area, laundromat and BBQ area.The rooms were spacious with comfortable beds, fridge and a table where you could eat if you didn't want to go out.Internet in the room is free which is rare in Honolulu.There is no need for a car as everything is in walking distance of the hotel and if you want to see something else on the island you can always take a tour or city bus which go all around the island as well.

The older air conditioners in the whole building are loud, they sound like fridge compressors that are about to go. We asked to be moved from 10th floor facing street to anywhere quieter. They agreed on our last (4th) night and moved us to 16th floor facing east, which has side ocean views over Fort Debussy Park. (higher floors have higher price but they didn't charge us) No road noise this side but air conditioner was the same. Fine if you are accustomed to such a noise anyway, not if you come from a frozen country which doesn't need air conditioners. There are no ceiling fans as alternatives. Their interior updates are good, almost 4-star with marble floors & shower surrounds, granite countertops. Weber BBQ's beside pool area. This section of beach in front of Fort DeBussy Park is the best in Waikiki. This hotel is close to shops. The front desk refused to give us a roll-away cot, saying it doesn't fit into the room, but the manager said he could supply an air mattress for $20/night from his on-the-side-business!??

The kitchen was a dream and came with a microwave, sink, mini refrigerator, stove, coffee maker, and all the utensils, pans, pots, etc. that you need. The free internet was awesome! Not the fastest out there but fast enough so you can look for directions to get around the city and what not. What I also loved about this hotel was its location! It's literally in the middle of everything you want to do. Shops and downtown are just a walk away... and the beach too! A 5 minute walk takes you to sandy shores where you can go paddle boarding, kayaking, etc. Parking is $25 (around) a day for your car, and they valet it for you every time - which is a nice touch.

We booked direct with Outrigger for $119/night for a Park/City View room. Upon check-in, we were told that as of January 1 self-park for $18 was no longer available (as it had been when I booked the room in November), and that we had to pay $25 for valet parking.The room was clean and average, nothing special. The view from our lanai was overlooking a gas station—very disappointing. There was a nice kitchenette with everything you need, unless you want hot food (no microwave, stove/oven or toaster). You get one packet of coffee, and then if you want more, you have to pay $1 a day. The bathroom was tiny, with only enough space for one person. On our second night, the AC went out. Someone from the front desk came up to look at it right away. Turns out the breaker tripped, so it was reset. About 10 minutes later, it went out again. We asked to move to another room, which was a hassle to pack up everything and move (from room 104 to 103). We were given no apologies or compensation for this inconvenience.The small pool area was nice, with cushioned lounge chairs and tables with umbrellas. We liked the location being near Fort DeRussy Park, and a five-minute walk to the beach, and close to restaurants. During the first part of our trip to Honolulu, we stayed at the Lotus at Diamond Head.

We walked to the Ala Moana shopping center in 12 minutes and all the way down Kalakaua Ave. to the end of Kuhio Beach in Waikiki in about 25 minutes. The deluxe shopping district is just outside the hotel door and across the street on kalakaua- Chanel, D&G, Tiffany, Dior etc. The Bus stop on Kuhio is just 2 minutes away for traveling further afield. the Hilton Hawaiian Village is a pleasant stroll through Ft DeRussy Park and has a fireworks display every Friday night. Waikiki Beach is about 7 minutes from the hotel.Dining opportunites: Protea Cafe attached to the lobby with healthy, tasty food at good prices and takeout available to pickup and carry to the pool or your room.

Due to this being a condo hotel with studio and 1 BR units with kitchens you will experience cooking smells in halls on some floors depending on guest food preferences. We had no problem on 15 but our 7th floor room was affected on some days.Staff: Friendly and attentive. Provided us with good information and even lent us 4 boogie boards for free when we drove up to Waimea for 2 days. If you need any beach equipment just ask and they'll provide it if they have it. Free beach / pool towels available at front deskKey info: Kalakaua is a busy street with traffic until late evening and early morning. Upper floor rooms are quieter but still not soundproof. You will hear sirens and car horns. Request park view if possible. Rooms ending in 1-6 are facing the south park and Avenue and are in shade all day. Rooms ending in 10 - 16 are facing the main park and beach and get the sun all day. After a few days we were glad to have the shady side which meant we could get away with no air conditioning while sleeping. The AC units are noisy.Summary: Staff were great. Fitness center was hardly used and quite adequate. Pool area gets afternoon sun, not heated. We all felt quite at home and would definitely stay here again. We preferred not being in the heart of Waikiki and felt the location was ideal for beach access, dining and shopping excursions either by foot or by bus.

We purchased a rental car and drove from Honolulu Intl to downtown Waikiki. If you are not familiar with the island, you can always take a taxi. H1 is the major highway that runs the majority of the island from the airport all the way to downtown Honolulu/Waikiki. It is the ONLY main artery to get you to and from so be prepared for heavy traffic especially in the mornings and mid-afternoon/ evenings.When I visited, Outrigger had 3 other locations so be sure if you take a taxi to specify the Luana. If you rent a car, there is private parking available under the hotel for $15/day if you park yourself, $18/day to have it valet parked. The hotel is located on the main strip into downtown, Kapiolani Blvd, so it is easily accessible to many tourists attractions. Check-in at the Luana was timely and conveniently located within the building. The front desk staff was very informative in regards to local activities. The majority of the Luana rooms/suites are actually condos/timeshares and are set up accordingly. Even the basic rooms had a small kitchenette in them (no stove) equipped with a mini-fridge, kitchen sink, and microwave. The appointments in the rooms were tropical mahogany woods and granite countertops. Depending on the location of the room, you either had a downtown or ocean view. The larger suites were fully equipped with a standard size fridge, oven/stove, micro, etc. The larger suites had a separate bedroom from the living area which included a couch, chairs, dinette table, and breakfast bar connected to the kitchen area. They also generally had two different views/balcony’s: a downtown view as well as an ocean one. (Mine was a corner unit so you had both directions). The rooms were very clean and well kept. There was a pool on the 5th floor (I believe) but it was not very large… however I never noticed it full or all of the chairs taken. There was a gym on the same level of the pool which offered various upgraded work-out equipment. The hotel also offered a grill area for guests to cook out and enjoy their food. The hotel itself was located approximately 2-3 blocks north of the beach (depending on which way you went, a 5 to 10 minute walk). Adjacent to the hotel was a large green space called Ainahau Triangle where I ran every morning. There were always groups of people out doing yoga or tai chi in the morning. Also close by is Fort Derussy Beach Park. If you exit the front of the hotel and turn right, straight up Kapiolani Blvd is all of the high-end designer stores, shopping, eating, and activities you can imagine! There are various other resorts right on the beach which have sea-side dining. They offer (especially at sunset) magnificent views of the ocean as well as Diamond Head- but be prepared to wait. Some take reservations, however some do not. So in conclusion, if you are looking for a first-class, on the ocean, resort- this is NOT that type of hotel. As previously stated, it is more catered toward longer stays vacationers and families who may eat out here and there but have to option to grocery shop and cook from their room as well. It is an optimal location for various activities and is priced very well for the amenities it offers.

My wife and I were on our honeymoon when we visited this hotel. As we were traveling on a budget but yet wanted something better (i.e. no less than the $100 price range), we found what we thought is a bargain. Unfortunately, the experience turned out to be much less than what we had paid for. When we checked in, the staff at the front desk was not very friendly and neither was he helpful. When I asked him if there is anywhere interesting to visit around the area, he just told me ""No, there is nothing interesting"". And when I asked him for suggestion for restaurants that serve local food, he pointed me to ""L&L Hawaiian Barbecue""! If I wanted L&L, I could have just visited the branch located in the city where I live in. Regarding the room, it is clean but is very noisy. My wife and I cannot really fall asleep the first night because the street noise together with the A/C noise just kept us awake. To make things worse, the bathtub was clogged, the shower head was broken (shooting water in the wrong direction) and the shower curtain has mildew. :( It's is nice enough that after we complained about it, they have the shower head and the clog fixed the next day. All in all, since we were on our honeymoon, we tried not to let this ruin our happy spirit and just let it slide. Looking for that little bright side of our stay, we did have a very good experience with the very friendly and helpful bell/valet person.

We do not actually use the rooms on our vacation for much more than sleeping. The price was very reasonable for Waikiki. Being airline employees, we fly stand by and the hotel was willing to work with us on late check in and possible cancellations due to unavailability of flights. We appreciated that and it was worth it.we arrived in HNL late on a thursday night and took the Waikiki Shuttle. It was a good value, but in hind site we would take a taxi next time. We were the first ones on the shuttle, waited a 1/2 hour for all other passengers and then were about the last ones off the shuttle. It took 1.5 hours to get to hotel. On way back we took the city bus. It is only $2.50 per person and stops near the Luana. It only took 35 - 45 minutes to get to airport.On our last day we took a tour of the island and had to leave at 7:30 am. The hotel staff stored our luggage for us and when we arrived back at 7:00 pm, they gave us towels and keys and allowed us to use the showers and changing rooms in the exercise area to freshen up prior to our trip to the airport.Thanks to all at the Luana.","Steamboat Springs, Colorado","skitown2354</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Steamboat Springs, Colorado</strong>",0,4.0

I was traveling with my wife, 1 and half year old son, and mother in law. We got a 1-bedroom ocean view condo for the three of us and a studio for my mother in law, who was helping watch the baby. The hotel staff was great, and they got us rooms on the same floor which made things convenient (7th floor). My wife was there for a conference for a couple days, but everything else was leisure.We paid $199 for the 1-bedroom ocean view and $99 for the studio (they upgraded us to the studio from a standard room at no cost to have us on the same floor).The rooms are clean, although the cleaning staff did skip us on two days. On one of the days they called in the late afternoon to see if we wanted it cleaned, but I declined as we were feeding the baby dinner and getting him ready for bed. They don't do dishes at any rate, just standard hotel cleaning services like towels.The water pressure is excellent.They provided us with a nice, metal folding crib.The bedroom was very specious, and really the whole apartment had plenty of room. We even had people over one night for a small party. The kitchen is great-- high quality appliances, well stocked with dishes, etc.This place is right next to a park which is actually quite nice if you have a kid. You have to cross a busy street which runs right through the middle of the park to reach the beach. I recommend you turn LEFT after leaving the hotel lobby and follow the path that starts right past the gas station. This will let you cross at a light and lead you towards the Hilton beach which is great for families. The park also has a par course which I did a few times.The drinks at the little store in the lobby are exactly twice the price as the same drinks right next door at the gas station (bottled water, etc). There's a well stocked general store across the street.The view from our condo was nice, looking out on the park, with a peek at the ocean past the beachfront hotels. It was perfect for viewing the fireworks that the Hilton sets off every Friday.The gym is quite nice, with good quality equipment.They have a nice BBQ area with high quality gas grills, which we used.We did not use the pool. It's quite small and seems to be a magnet for elderly people. We were much more attracted by the beach, which is a 10 minute walk.The condo is VERY QUIET. Other than the air conditioners, we never heard a thing. No street noise, no noise from the neighbors. Did we even have neighbors? Maybe not.My biggest disappointment is the only way to reach the bathroom is through the master bedroom. This is awkward if you've got a baby napping in the room, or you have guests who have to traipse through the bedroom (or someone staying on the sofa bed in the living room). Why they thought this was a good design is beyond me. Having the bathroom access from the common area makes so much more sense.Three free wifi internet works great.Parking is expensive - $18 a day. I don't think we really needed the rental car we got.All in all, I would recommend the place. Would we stay here again? Maybe... but the Hilton looked awfully nice.","Los Angeles, CA","tj90025</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong>",3,4.0

I guess the opinion depends on the person staying there. It is located at the end of the Kalakaua strip so it isnt pushed up against all the other hotels but still walking distance to everything. Conveniently, there is a rental car service (dollar/thrifty) right across the street. The staff waived our parking fee since we were only keeping our rental there one night. We stayed here six nights and enjoyed every bit of it. The rooms are nice and clean and have just about everything you need, flat screen t.v.'s, kitchenettes, hide-a-bed sofas, etc. The rooms are of great size and the beds I found to be incredibly comfortable. Room service did an awesome job at replenishing necessities. We booked this hotel not expecting much out of it since we werent planning on spending any time in the hotel but, I have to say that the Luana exceeded our expectations! I am extremely particular about where I stay...the room has to feel clean in order for me to enjoy my stay and this hotel was right on the money. If you plan to sit in your room all day then you should consider one of the $200+a-night hotels located right across from the beach. But if your looking for a good night's rest, a place to keep your belongings while you enjoy the island, and a great staff, I would definitely recommend the Luana.","Alameda, California","iSlandLove032</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alameda, California</strong>",1,5.0

A bit stingy if you ask me, as most people would like coffee daily. They do have free coffee and pastries in the lobby until 10am. The second complaint was the housekeeper didn't change our sheets, ewe.This is a hotel, not our home. The hotel is a short walk (5-10 min) through a park (with banana trees) to the beach. I wanted to be a bit away from the strip because of all the noise other reviewers mentioned and am glad I did. There were sirens going all evening long, but mostly in the distance. The Front Desk was very informative when asked an assortment of questions from where a place was to how to hook up the internet in room. They offer a free trolley service that circles around the local shopping areas, a map included. The Bell Hop and Valet guys were so friendly and we didn't even use their services!

The hotel had a really nice pool area and sunbeds which got the sun from late morning until sunset. Next door was a very functional gym with free weights, weight machines, a running machine, two bikes and a cross trainer.

They called it a partial ocean view but once you stepped out on the balcony you got a full sweeping view of both the city of Honolulu towards Waikik and also a full view of the ocean across Fort Derussy Park. Nice large room though the shower nozzle really needed cleaning and the bathroom was a bit small.Large flat screen tv with approx 70 cable channels. Free internet connection as well and lots of storage space. Also a free inroom safe though when we arrived it wasnt working and we phoned down to advise the front desk. Within 10 minutes a maintenance guy came up and fixed it, so very prompt service.They have a small pool area though the pool is nicely looked after. Good quality poolside furniture with 12 sun beds plus 4 cabana's with tables and chairs.Free beach/pool towels area available from the front desk.In the morning there was coffee and pastries down in the main lobby and in the afternoon there was always a pitcher of cool citrus infused water with a bowl of maui style chips. A very nice touch especially if you are coming back from walking in the sun.There is a spa in the hotel that we didn't use and also a fitness centre that you have to sign a waiver for.They have just recently introduced valet parking at $18 a day. When I booked the hotel it was self parking at $10 a day and they honoured that rate which was appreciated. The valet guys always greeted when you left the hotel or when you arrived. Customer service seems to be a high priority at the hotel.If you are thinking of renting a car then instead of the hotel possibly consider the Dollar car rental which is kitty corner to the hotel on Kalakaua avenue. Very handy as its a 1 minute walk but make sure you arrive at least an hour of your scheduled pick up time as the line gets long as they bring in people from other hotels and cruise ships, plus its also doubles as a Thrifty car rental agency.The Luana is about a 5 minute walk from where Waikiki really begins. So about 5 minutes if that to Beachwalk street. Lots of restaurant options within easy walking distance including Cheesecake Factory [10 minutes], Tony Roma's [2 minutes] plus there is the Royal Hawaiian 3 level mall with lots of low end to high end stores including a large Apple outlet and food court on the second level in the middle building.The only downside if you can call it that is that they need to clean the showerheads in the rooms! A bit of CLR [see those tv ads managment] would clear up the problem in a couple of minutes. The shower spray was powerful but it was very narrow. For a big guy like me I had to run around in the shower a bit to get wet!!All in all though this is a good choice for a hotel without having to pay the fortunes that other hotels ask for a small view of the beach or to be right on the beach. You care a very short walk to Waikiki beach itself though we found it so crowded we were more than happy to use the pool facilities at the hotel.

The room is supposed to only allow 3 ppl but the GM relunctantly allow us to have the extra person. It worked out fine and slept comfortably but I do not recommend asking for this as it really is against their policy. We just weren't prepared to pay the extra for the larger room and they were very gracious to accomodate us. No frills services - morning coffee & pastries provided but no onsite restaurant was open (looked like they had space for it but was closed)Recommend using ABC and Whaler stores for everyday needs and found these stores prices to be very reasonable. Also found lots of good beach & souvenier items there. Pros: Kitchenette for extended stays.location away from busiest part of Waikiki but easy walk to it. We had a rental car and it was only $10 day to park which was best rate i saw since most hotels charged alot more. Was nice to be able to get in and out as we pleased. Also, great beach park within short walk thru park that isn't the busiest part of Waikiki with $40 day for 2 chairs & umbrella if you don't want to be a french fry. Take time to walk down beach to Hilton Resort on that beach. Also, recommend shopping in gift shop in this hotel because the prices were discounted from other stores and they had some nice things. Cons: no onsite restaurant or food services other than outside delivery.Pool is small if that matters to you but could be a plus cause it is very intimate and great for after beach dip.Overall, good experience for 7 nite stay.","Houston, Texas","laura b</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",6,4.0

The kitchen was updated with newer appliances, granite countetops, and tile backsplash. The kitchenette only comes with a queen (king not avail). The bed is platform type so there is no box spring and the mattress slides quite a bit. Not that comfortable to me. There's a 2-person dining table along with a sofa and coffee table. The common hallways were hot and muggy.The A/C unit is basically a window unit and mine was loud. Much quieter if you run the fan only but then it gets hot. I had a mountain/city view looking at Kapakaua Ave. The hotel is next to a gas station so it's always busy and the ambulance runs all night. The room does have a flat screen TV with lots of channels. Internet is free but wired. The ironing board is mini - half the size of a regular one and it sits on 6-inch legs if that. I guess you're supposed to put it on a table but it didn't work for me having to iron pants and shirts for work.Parking is only $10/day and you prepay for that. They will credit your card if you leave early (I checked out after 3 days). Parking is in the basement but only one elevator goes to basement. Sometimes you have to go the lobby first, then get on the elevator that goes to the basement. And parking is limited and it's tight parking. Fitness equipment was fairly new but pool was really small. I counted only 12 lounge chairs at the pool. There is only one ice machine in the hotel and it's on the 1st floor along with the pool, laundromat, and gym.I checking out on my 3rd day of a 15-day trip because it wasn't that comfortable to me as a business traveler.

Somehow renovations just don;t make a place look ""new"". I have no other hotels to compare it to, so maybe it was great compared to them. The ""partial ocean view"" was over the roof of the closed retaurant below. Hardly picturesque.The good thing was that you were not looking out right at another hotel.

On our first week we stayed at Waikiki Gateway because we wanted somewhere basic to stay. I'm 26 and my brother is 20 so we don't care too much for what kind of hotel we stay in. So I paid twice as much as this hotel compared to Waikiki Gateway and the service here was terrible. There were hardly any greetings from the reception staff and the valet car parking service was terrible. When I was at Waikiki Gateway we were tipping between $5 and $10 per request, but with these guys I was only tipping $1 and $2! It was almost like they didn't want to get me my car. The hotel manager was even worse. I kindly asked him for a pool towel, he looks at me, grabs a towel and dumps it on the counter and doesn't even acknowledge me. On our first day we left a $10 tip of each of our beds for the cleaners (to make our beds) and all they did was pull the blankets up over the bed. I COULD'VE DONE THIS MYSELF AND SPARED MYSELF $10!

And here's the warning if you are driving yourself - the hotel has no visible signage on the outside of the building (except right above the front entrance of the hotel but you don't see this until you drive past), no sandwich boads or flags to alert you to the hotel entrance. There is a set of traffic lights just as you reach the hotel, a gas station immediately next door to the hotel, but you don't realise you have arrived at the hotel until you drive right past it. Managed to miss it a couple of times even after we'd checked in!Anyway, after a loop around the block we eventually found the driveway and found our way to reception and then waited, probably for 10 minutes or so before anyone showed up at the front desk. And when the receptionist did arrive, there were no apologies for keeping us waiting, I almost felt like I was intruding..... Certainly no warm Aloha welcome for us!I then headed to the room with the porter, who by this stage had worked out it was probably quite a good idea to help to get our luggage out of the car. Hubby parked the car in the hotel garage (can't remember the daily charge but I don't think it was too expensive). On arriving at the room, neither of the key cards would open the door, so the porter used his and then returned to reception to acquire new cards. This became an ongoing issue the entire stay with the key cards, we probably had them replaced every day, sometimes more than once. Really annoying....We were on 14th floor facing the street. Quite a nice outlook over the city but a little noisy at night. It was nice though to have a reasonable sized balcony to sit out on. The room wasn't huge, the bed I believe was only a double and it was on a divan type base. The mattress was comfortable enough, but everytime one of us moved, there was a terrible creaking and groaning from the wooden base. Certainly didn't encourage too much activity for fear of the bed breaking!! Pillow points on this occasion rate a very poor 3! The bedside tables were really inadequate too, simply because they had these really large bedside lamps on them - really quirky wooden lamps - Hawaiian hula dancer on one side and an Hawaiian surfer with surfboard on the other, but they were so big, they took up most of the bedside table. And along with the telephone on one side and the radio (with Ipod station!!!) on the other, there was little room for any personal items. And only one small drawer.The lighting in the room was really poor too. Well done for using eco friendly light bulbs, but they are useless to read by, and they kind of defeat the purpose when you have to have every light in the room on, just to be able to read the map for the next day's activities.My other moan was there was nowhere to put our luggage. No luggage stand, so one case on the pull out sofa bed. ( Not sure what you would do if you had a third person in the room), and the other case on the floor. Another irritation was that the coffee was never replaced. We asked for more but were told to purchase it from the front desk. But on the positive side, a great location. A walk through the park gets you to the beach. It's just a couple of blocks from the main shopping area, and a great Thai restaurant straight across the road.","Auckland, New Zealand","z1bby</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",56,3.0

If you are doing your own catering it is a bit of a walk to the nearest proper grocery store but there are a couple of convenience stores just over the road for essentials.

We had a ""partial ocean view room"" on the seventh floor for $129/night base rate, plus $10/night to park our rental car in the small underground garage (which would not be charged if you didn't have a car), plus $16.72/night tax, which is $155.72 per night total. A room without any ""ocean view"" is less expensive and that's what I'd probably get if I visited again assuming I could be on an upper floor. The hotel is about four city blocks from the ocean, and you really can't see enough of it from the hotel to make a difference. There is no restaurant or bar, but, although unadvertized, they had some juice, bread and coffee in the lobby in the morning. We opted for a full breakfast at Vit's Steakhouse which is no more than two blocks away, an excellent recommendation by the hotel. The hotel also has a free business center for internet access, rare in our experience in Hawaii, which we used, and a pool, which we did not use. The room was clean, comfortable and reasonably up-to-date. The mattress was firm, which we like. All staff members we dealt with were friendly and helpful. When we first went to our room the sliding glass door to our balcony did not work properly, but when notified the hotel sent someone up right away to fix it. We had a TV and small refrigerator and bar sink in the room, along with some cups and glasses (the housekeepers did not clean the cups and glasses for us day to day, however). The hotel is located on a city street at the west end of the Waikiki beach area. It is an easy walk, about four-city blocks I'd guess, from the hotel directly across Fort DeRussy, which is actually a very nice park, to the Waikiki beach and the hotel is otherwise convenient to all of the Waikiki beach resort hotels and shopping. All in all, it is a great place to stay, if this is what you are looking for.","Charlotte, North Carolina","Roycal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charlotte, North Carolina</strong>",98,5.0

WOW~ was I surprised! Right off the main area of Waikiki, within easy walking distance to the beach, the shopping, and the restaurants, we found a hidden gem! The hotel was beautiful from the outside, and the staff was super friendly! Everyone was always smiling and extremely helpful...even after an extremely grumpy customer was at the desk loudly complaining of something (I never figured out what it was...she was pretty loud, though), the desk clerk still turned to me and answered my questions with a huge smile and very friendly attitude.The rooms were spacious and VERY CLEAN. Surprised to find a small lanai outside, didn't expect it and I loved spending my mornings watching the sun come up and hearing the birds. Actually spent more time there than in the room! Coffee was only provided the first morning, but was available in the lobby every day. We did not have a microwave...would have been nice, but there were plates, glasses, and utensils when we ordered in. Parking was onsite for $10 a day...not too bad when compared to elsewhere in the area, and I had expected it before, so was prepared. The pool was small and chilly, but the deck was great and the lounges were comfortable and plentiful.There were even grills available to use...pretty cool if I'd wanted to actually stick around and cook! :-)Walking to the beach was a pleasure. My husband HATES to walk anywhere, but he even enjoyed the walk :-) and all you had to do was step out the front door and head to the right to enjoy great shopping, dining, and street entertainers (ok, maybe some of those could have used a little practice... but some were pretty good! lol).Overall, we would DEFINITELY stay there again and recommend to our friends... and guess what?

I was expecting more. Yes, the rooms are updated. The furnishings are somewhat outdated. There was rust on the bathroom floor. We booked at kitchette studio and were upgraded to a partial ocean view kitchenette studio - it was more like a park/ocean view - very nice view. But, the room was very small. Only 2 chairs/2 towels, etc. even though we have a 7 yo son (total 3). It was almost too small to want to cook/prepare/eat meals in the room. The lanai is very small. One day 2 of arrival, I woke up to my face directly on a MATTRESS. They do not use fitted sheets. RANK. Health issue. Disgusting. I complained. The mgr wasn't very supportive. They got a king sheet (for a queen bed) and tucked it deep under the mattress to rectify it - that worked. Also, enough dust under the TV for us to write our name in - also disgusting. The toaster was broken. They came up immediately and switched out one that worked fine. We had a microwave that worked fine. They make the beds daily but left dirty dishes in the sink. The internet connection was good - it is not ""wireless"" as you do need to plug it into a phone cord. Can't google on the Lanai - no reach. They have free donuts/coffee in the morning - my kiddo loved the donuts. In the afternoon, they had Hawaiian chips + iced-lemon water.

We stayed in a one bedroom suite with a partial ocean view at the Outrigger Luana in Waikiki. We really researched in to many hotels and condos before deciding on this one. We loved the layout of the whole room with a large wrap around kitchen and TWO private lanais. I think this was the best feature because we could choose where we wanted to have our breakfast-overlooking the ocean or on the bedroom lanai looking at the wonderful city line. The bathroom had extra large counter space which was perfect for all of my extra stuff...and there were two tvs that both came equipped with dvd players. The staff were very friendly and willing to help. Beware that this condo is a bit far from the actual beach and even though you can see it from your window, it lines up with the Fort DeRussy beach which is not accessible to ""common"" folk. Still, walking to the beach is not an issue when you go from the main Waikiki strip...it is a pleasure to wander around and see the sights. An important tip for those wanting to go to the Waikele Premium Outlet mall, right across the street from the Luana is the Ambassador hotel, just outside from there you can catch the shuttle out to Waikele for only $5.00 both ways...if you are lucky enough, the driver will drop you right off at the condo on the way back but it is a very short 2 minute walk.We enjoyed our stay and liked that it was rather quiet in our area. The pool was quite nice although we did miss having an actual restaurant in the building, there were several nearby. If you want a nice quiet space that is very large and private for honeymooners, the Outrigger Luana is perfect. We didn't need to rent a car because it was still close to the shops and the price was extremely reasonable...oh and a big thing..their wireless internet access is perfect...not too slow or terrible like we found at our resort in Maui!","Calgary, Canada","Lisadarlene</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",19,4.0

Beautiful lobby - Hawaiian decor, clean, friendly desk staff, always an elevator waiting for you. The room itself was lovely - just like the pictures.

Balcony had 2 wicker chairs and end table. The carved wooden Hawaiian lamps in the room are great - one is a man the other a woman both in hula poses. There was no toaster or microwave though but for $8 we picked a toaster up at WalMart and saved on breakfasts and lunches by having them in our room - not to mention the pounds we avoided gaining by not eating large meals 3 times a day. The pool was crystal clear, cleaned daily, had lots of pool chairs - towels at the front desk. They also have a very nice gym c/w 2 treadmills, eliptical, 2 exercise bikes, free weights and several weight machines. Overall, only 2 minor complaints. The shower could use a new shower head.

Upsides included cleanliness, full kitchen, good value; downsides (aside from no honeymoon code) included lots of street noise for the city or mountain view room we had and the parking isn't free.

I was on the seventh floor, with a view overlooking the main strip (ala moana blvd) and had a great partial view of the ocean and Waikiki from the balcony. Two queen size beds, which if I dig deep, would be my only complaint; I found the bed to be too soft. BUT this is minor! Room was very clean, with sink and seperate bathroom with sink as well. It had a small refridgerator and service was sublime! John the night clerk recommended a most excellent pub when I arrived late in the evening (The Yard House, 130 beers on tap!) Tired and a little razzzeled from Honolulu's slightly confusing maze of streets, John knew the look and instantly recommended the place. Outstanding! Service was well maintained on all levels! The hotel front is located right on the Ala Moana and within easy reach of everything you want...shopping during the day, nightlife, and Waikiki is but a couple blocks. Not directly on the beach, but who cares...outstanding facility!Another person who attended the class had a slightly different room on the 6th floor, with king bed, and overlooking the park (no ocean view). He did however have a two burner stove and microwave in the room, which mine did not. But I did not care, I enjoyed some fabulous food at other places.Parking is available; however I am not sure if they charge for this or not. As I said, company paid the bill. I had G2 parking with my own slot assigned. My companion had G1 parking and did not have a specific spot assigned. He did try to park within G2 one night, but received a notice not to park there again, only on G1. So G2 may cost more to park.And if you like Ribs, Tony Roma's is a block up the street on the opposite side and a good Thai Restaurant, Keos is located directly across.

For the first two days of our vacation, we stayed at a sister property - The Outrigger on the Beach and were very satisfied. I arrived at the Luana with high expectations. I knew that the rate was $70 less per night than I had paid at the Outrigger on the Beach but felt that I had previously paid a premium for staying at an oceanfront hotel. When I arrived at the Luana, I was a bit taken aback by the unimpressive lobby. It is very, very small. The staff was very friendly. I arrived very early as we had just disembarked from a cruise and I was immediately given a room. I went upstairs to my room and noticed that the halls were very warm. I entered my room and it was OK - on par with a Quality Inn or Best Western. The walls had no wallpaper but were covered in a textured paint as was the ceiling.I had tons of kitchen cabinets - most of them empty and a fridge. No microwave or stove so I have no idea why anyone would need so many cabinets. Didn't really matter as I hadn't planned on eating in anyway. The bedcovers were clean as was the room but looked like they had been washed more than a few times. The remote for the television was actually cracked and the lid to the battery compartment kept falling off. The bathroom was very small and when I looked in the tub there was some sort of small spider. Later, when I went to shower, the water was rust colored and I had to let it run a while. My air conditioner was very noisy. Turned on and off constantly and loudly. The location was nice during the day - a 10 -15 minute to the beach. I went to the beach near the Hilton Hawaiin Village. Since chairs by the Hilton were expensive to rent, I walked a few blocks down the beach and was able to rent beach chairs for considerably less. There is a nice coffee shop on Ala Moana Blvd across from the Hilton. Very crowded for breakfast. At night, I felt the area was less crowded than by the International Market Place and I was nervous about walking about.

The tile floors offered a clean feel. We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel room, but its central location made it great if you don't plan on renting a car. We found that for a short stay (3 nights) a car isn't necessary - especially if you plan on doing tours that will pick you up at your hotel.

I have to say that we were pleasantly surprised. We had a one bedroom condo for 3 adults and 2 small children. They were very accommodating and did not require us to book a 2 bedroom due to the fact that we had 5 people total. They took the fact that we had a 2 and 5 year old into consideration and said it was no problem. This was a problem with other condos. Check in was quick and pleasant. Bell man was very friendly and gave us directions to the nearest grocery store. The condo was very clean and modern. Kitchen was wonderful with granite countertops, fairly new appliances, plenty of dishes, pots and pans, glass ware, etc. The bedroom was large enough to fit a rollaway without being too constricting. There was a large walk-in closet with a safe. The bathroom was big enough and clean. The couch bed was fine, my father had no complaints. We did use the laundry facility with was sufficient. Overall we were very pleased. We had been to Waikiki in 07 and stayed at another hotel where the room was tiny, the bathroom floor was old and stunk, and the staff could care less. At the Outrigger Luana it couldn’t be better. The price is great, staff is very friendly, and the condo was fantastic. As for the location we didn’t have a problem at all. We were able to walk all the way to the Ala Moana Mall and in the opposite direction to the International Market Place with no problem. It took us a day to figure out a good beach for the kids that was within walking distance. We found if you walk out of the hotel and head towards the gas station, turn left at the park (immediately after you pass the gas station), head towards the ocean, cross the street at the light and turn right. The first side street you come to turn left. Walk all the way down and you will be in front of the Hilton Hawaiian Village which has a really nice beach and the waves are fairly calm for little kids. It sounds far but my 5 year old walked it twice everyday with no problem. There is also a nice patio restaurant there that serves burgers and sandwiches.

The walk to the ocean is very pleasant, especially when there are a lot of flowers in bloom (pretty much always in Hawaii).This time around, I found that they have added a free internet in every room (which might be a good or a bad thing, considering how many things you can see here if you don't waste too many hours browsing around).

There were also tables and chairs by the BBQ area to eat there as well. There are coin Laundry facilities and a very nice fitness center. We absolutely loved our room, from the lanai we could see the fireworks that the HIlton puts on every friday and the view was to die for, how sad to come home and look out the window at our boring view of the neighbours back yard!

We had some trouble finding the hotel - drove by it a couple times before realizing the correct entrance. The location of the hotel is great - it's right by several good restaurants and shopping. The staff was very friendly - checking-in and out wasn't a problem.We were not very happy with the room we were given - first floor, right on top of the road. The room was missing an element of ""luxury"" that other hotels in the area have. In fact, later in our trip we stayed at another hotel in Waikiki for $25 more per night and were much happier. The Outrigger isn't a bad hotel - the room was clean, TV worked fine, bathroom was comfortable. But once we compared it to another hotel in a similar price-range, we were convinced we'll stay in the other hotel next time.","Indianapolis, IN","Type-A_Planner</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Indianapolis, IN</strong>",31,3.0

We are a young couple in our mid 20's who enjoy traveling alot and are not difficult people to deal with. However, this one is truly a hotel experience to remember forever. I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Outrigger Luana and booked it through Travelocity, which I will also never do again. So before booking this hotel, we read great reviews about it on Trip Advisor and searched for the lowest rate. It turned out that Travelocity had the best rate because the site clearly stated that there was ""Free Parking"" at the hotel. Since most hotels in the Waikiki area charge $15 to $25 a night for parking, we decided to book it with Travelocity. To ensure that Free Parking was a guarantee, we even called the Customer Service number and was confirmed by one of the staffs that Parking was included for free.When we got there, the hotel manager told us that parking was $18/day even tho we had the confirmation printed out with a print screen saying that Free Parking was included as one of the amenities. She told us that they never had free parking even tho it stated on our reservation. So she called Travelocity on the spot when we tried checking in and they said that they don't have free parking stated on their site. Turns out that Travelocity updated their site since we booked it 2 months ago and deleted the free parking. The manager then insisted that she would try to figure out how the Free Parking even got there in the first place. At one point, they were even trying to accuse us of modifying the confirmation even tho we had a print out of it! Can you believe that? First of all, why the would you ever put your guests in this situation where you have doubts on how the confirmation turned out. I thought that was extremely unprofessional of them and was highly disappointed. We also felt so uncomfortable staying there because all the staff knew that we were the ones who had the ""parking issue"" and was not too friendly to us. Anyhow, they really ruined the reputation for the Outrigger chain hotel. If I were them, I would just easily have taken care of the $90 parking especially when we had the confirmation printed out and was so upset over it. I thought overall it was so unfair and that it was a false advertisement. Bottom line is regardless if it's Travelocity's fault or not, they should just cover it and somehow try to get reimbursement with Travelocity and not inconvenient the guests by making us call and contact Travelocity directly. This was our vacation! We did not have to even deal with this! If it wasn't for the parking mess, I might stay here again. But because of it, I rather stay somewhere else where it's closer to the beach and provide me with better customer service. Enough said, just never again at this hotel!

I just returned from a five-night stay at the Outrigger Luana and I'm happy to say I made the right choice! For $135/night, I got a ""park view"" studio room, which faces Fort DeRussy R&R Park and the ocean, which was very nice! I found the queen bed and furnishings extremely comfortable and nice to look at. There's an ""eSafe"" in the armoire closet for your laptop and other valuables. There's a good-sized TV and an Ethernet cable connected to the Internet! Granted, it's not wireless, but it's cable Internet (Oceanic Cable) and it's FREE. No dial-up here.While I didn't have a kitchen room, my studio room had a nice granite countertop, sink and mini-fridge, which kept my leftover dinners fresh. (Just go downstairs to the friendly Front Desk folks and have them microwave your meals.) I bought fresh fruits, veggies, bagels and cream cheese, and guava juice. Having the fridge saved me money. There are kitchen amenities like utensils, plates and glasses too.I had a handicapped bathroom without a tub, which was fine; the shower was great. Some reviewers mentioned there's a lack of space for personal toiletries, which is true. So I kept them on the granite countertop outside.I exercised at the small Fitness Center, mostly for weight training (machines and free weights). There are two treadmills and a bike, which is just right for this small condo hotel.The Luana staff are extremely friendly and helpful; they greet you when you leave and greet you when you return. Check-in and check-out was extremely fast and efficient. Security is always a concern for someone traveling alone and I felt very safe; it's very comforting to see hotel security walking the property. The Bell Staff and Housekeeping are also friendly and helpful too.I didn't bother getting a car since I'm from Honolulu and know my way around by bus (TheBus) and by foot. The Luana is so close to everything, just get a good map (ask the Front Desk for one), buy a multi-day bus pass and explore on your own. The Luana is centrally-located and close to shopping and transportation. I'm a runner so I ran all over Waikiki and Honolulu with a runner's backpack, water and food. You might see runners training for December's Honolulu Marathon (they run in packs).Something fun you might want to try is going on the Outrigger Reef Hotel's catamaran, which is within walking distance of the Luana. Supposedly, it's the fastest catamaran ride in Waikiki.

The Luana is a very good value and just about as close to the beach as you can get without being on the beach. Even though I booked an ""Ocean View"" room, I was still told on checking that I was upgraded to an ocean view room. Weird, but I didn't really care that much. The room on first glace was very modern and clean. The kitchenette was furnished with kitchen maid appliances and was spotless and the rest of the room was just as nice. The bathroom was very small and seemed clean, but I noticed later that there was quite a bit of rust around the tub. It appears that the only part of the room that wasn't refurbished was the tub and shower. Housekeeping failed twice to replace the remote that had been broken (the tile floor must have done a number on the remote). I'm not sure if they were ignoring me, or that they just didn't have any extra remotes for the 27"" Sony TV. The view was nice across the park and I could look right now to most of Waikiki and Diamond Head.I felt that I did get my money from the hotel, but the room was a little disappointed given the glowing reviews on this site. I can only guess that maybe my bathroom wasn't completely redone. I probably wouldn't stay there again, but families looking to save some money but still have an ocean view will probably be pleased. Not really a business hotel, but I'm guessing that isn't its target market.","Tempe, Arizona","tempejim</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tempe, Arizona</strong>",22,3.0

The hotel was great - the staff was friendly and courteous, and I didn't notice any insects anywhere. Besides - in Hawaii, cockroaches will show up even in the nicest 5-star hotels - that's what you get for being in the tropics. Anyways - the room they gave us was pretty nice - a studio with two queen beds, a kitchenette, and a lanai with a city view. The kitchenette didn't have a microwave - which would've been a great amenity - but otherwise, everything was clean and in good condition. Since the floors were marble - it would've helped if housekeeping had swept the floors during their daily cleaning - as the sand you accumulate at the beach starts to accumulate. The pool was nice, there was a big patio area to relax and sunbathe on - with some shaded areas for those who preferred to stay out of the sun. It was a small pool, but clean - and refreshing. The location was good too, not far from the beaches - but close to other attractions as well. There were lots of places for food around - a short walk to the other hotels in Waikiki - and there was an ABC store right across the street (which anyone who's been to Hawaii knows - you're in there numerous times over the course of your stay). I'd definitely stay here again, and recommend it to other people who are looking to travel to Hawaii.

When we got back from our day out, the rice and crumbs had not been swept up, AND I found a dead roach right in the middle of the kitchen floor.

This is what we had expected all along.The location of the place is really good. A 5 minute walk to the beach, right on Ft Derussy park, lots of shopping and dining very close. But the bug thing really creeped me out. But the nail in the coffin was the courtesy room. I have stayed at many Outrigger places in the past and have always used a courtesy room. It is usually the worst hotel room that they let you use for 30 minutes to take a shower on the day you check out. They list this as a feature on the internet and we even asked about it when we checked out. They said no problem just ask. So we put our suntan lotion on and went out all day. We had an 11pm flight and wanted to shower up for a late dinner and a long flight home. When we asked at the front desk they told us the courtesy room was the two outdoor bathrooms by the pool. We were told to lock the doors so no one would walk in on us. The men’s bathroom had 2 sinks, a toilet stall at the back and a small shower right across from the urinal. The floor was soaked with urine and I wouldn’t take my shoes off, let alone take a shower. The women’s bathroom was right across from 2 outdoor gas grills, and my wife said there were so many ants crawling around she was afraid they would crawl into her suitcase if she opened it up. Needless to say, neither of us showered and went home dirty and uncomfortable. When we turned the key and pool towels in the front desk person was so ashamed of what he did he wouldn’t look at us or ask if things were ok. He knew what he did. I really am sorry to say I can’t recommend this place to anyone. I love the location and the remodeled rooms. The parking increase was unpleasant, the roach infestation was totally unacceptable, and the courtesy room sealed the deal. Most people were very helpful at the front desk and the bellman was great, but there are way too many other new places opening up on Lewers Street to try rather than stay here. Beware.","Orland Park, IL","edboogie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orland Park, IL</strong>",152,1.0

Our studio room (515) had a nice and recently renovated kitchenette with a decent supply of dishes for 4, tableware, and cooking accessories. We had a bit of a view of the ocean from the small balcony which surprised me since we were to have only a city view. The air conditioner worked very nicely. My husband liked the exercise facilities. The pool is small but nicely kept. The pool deck is on the smaller side but equipped with comfortable chairs and tents to shield from the sun. Other than that, the positives mostly end and the negatives begin. To start, (and this is a big one for me,) there is no fan in the bathroom...puhlease!! We tried to call the main lobby when we couldn't access our phone messages and couldn't dial through. When my husband went to the lobby, he was told that our phone ""buttons"" hadn't been set up yet. What on earth kind of excuse is that? There were cockroaches in the room (I hope we didn't bring them home with us in our luggage.) There was no information book in the room to explain where the pool, laundry facilities, ice machine, etc., are located or to give information on restaurants, boutique hours, check-in, etc., or any of the usual information found in a book in hotel rooms. When I asked the front desk about one, I was told there isn't one. The queen bed was more of a large double. I sincerely doubt that was a queen bed. There was a small baby ironing board...the kind that sits on 2 inch legs on a table and moves all over the place while you're trying to iron. The coffee for the coffeemaker had to be bought at the front desk. The first night is supplied in the room, but after that, the supply is not refreshed...which is fine, I guess. It was poor quality coffee. The bathroom door squeaked loudly and had to be pushed with your weight against the door to close it. The bathroom is supplied with two rough towels, two washcloths, two hand towels, nothing extra. The toilet was the cheap plastic seat type with a rough surface as if something had gotten stuck to the lid and never completely removed. The floor was only swept by housekeeping when I left a tip and a note to request it. The housekeeping staff, however, were very nice and left the room neat. The sheets were barely large enough to go 6 inches down the side of the bed and there wasn't much on top to fold over the bedspread. They do not do dishes. You need to wash your own dishes. The furniture had many worn spots in the wood stain. You pay separately for parking and internet access (which is only accessible in the lobby). I would not stay there again. This hotel was not what I had expected for $200 a night and the many positive reviews I read. Granted, staying in Waikiki is not inexpensive, but when I have it to do again, I'll pay the extra money to stay at a better hotel where the amenities are included in the price, the sheets fit the bed, and the other negatives are hopefully minimized.",Oregon,"LadyLo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oregon</strong>",29,2.0

We traveled with a small group, and we rented six rooms at the Luana. We were pleasantly suprised by our stay! The Luana staff was very helpful, the rooms larger than expected, and at a very convienent location! Everyone in our group had a great experience. We quickly found out that the walk to the beach is only about three blocks, and there are many restaurants located within walking distance of the hotel.The expedia desk in the lobby provided great, and accurate information to anywhere we were interested in going in Hawaii. This is the place to stay if you want a hotel room located close to Waikiki, but not directly in the middle of all the major hotels. We had friends stay at the Reef on the Beach, and they enjoyed time at our hotel as it wasn't as busy, and the rooms were larger.

We are not big on sunning or surfing, although we like ocean view, and the Luana was perfect. You can see the sunset every evening out the balcony. The rooms are quaint, clean, and the customer service was great. We were put in a room above the exhaust fans from the neighboring restaurant, and while it was noisy, it's not like we expected for it to be peace and quiet. It's Waikiki! There are horns blowing, and traffic noise anyway. If you don't like noise, don't stay in Waikiki. I am not a big fan of it, but the location of the hotel was appealing to us because it was close to everything and we wouldn't have to have a car all week. Most activities provide transportation to and from Waikiki hotels, free of charge. It's right on Kalakaua Street, which has tons of restaurants, shops, etc. within walking distance. We prettty much walked everywhere we needed to go in Waikiki, and took TheBus to places that were a bit farther away. We went to Wailana coffee house (which was a short walk away) nearly every morning because it was the closest place open. I couldn't wait to try it, after reading all of the reviews on here. I was dissapointed with it...it's just like any other breakfast diner with the exception of the guava juice, fresh pineapple (which is served with nearly every meal in Hawaii), and coconut syrup. The pool for the hotel is dissapointing if you are planning on spending a lot of time at the pool. There is no direct sunlight until afternoon, either. I tried laying out there for a short while but became impatient waiting for the sun, and walked to the beach. We had a partial ocean view and a kitchenette, although we didn't even use the kitchen. It has a two-burner stove, a microwave (which is difficult to use I think), a small fridge, and a sink. It's supplied with forks, knives, plates, and bowls. There is a TGI Fridays right across the street, which is convenient for lunch. I would also recommend Todai, which is a short walk away - they have a great sushi and seafood buffet. I think it was $30/person, but it was completely worth it.The activities desk in the lobby is also helpful, as you can just call them, and they will do all of the homework for you and set up basically any activity you want. So in conclusion, great place to stay! Affordable and great location!","Blacksburg, VA","Kelly D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Blacksburg, VA</strong>",8,4.0

For the first night I was there I was in park view studio for a very nice rate and I came back to the Outrigger for my last three nights and I have no complaints the resturant fans did not bother us and we did have the sliding glass door open. I also stayed in the Turtle Bay Resort and the Outrigger in my opinion was better the Outrigger did not have fees and other unrelated charges.

Right by the park, and easy walk from the strip, and in close proximity to the outstanding ""Todai"" buffet where we went three evenings. The rooms were clean and we saw none of the insects mentioned. The one bedroom with kitchen was perfect for the two of us providing us with a great breakfast and pinapple cutting area. The staff was absolutely as helpful as can be for a non-full-service hotel. Be aware that the concierge at the hotel is from Expedia so you may not always get completely objective advise at that desk.

Unfortunately, we encountered huge problems which spoiled the beginning of our trip. First, the kitchen flooded and my 3 year old slipped and fell. Apparently the piping wasn’t connected properly behind the dishwasher. Then came the cockroaches! Lots of them! In the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and living room. Total infestation! At midnight, we had to move all of our stuff and our 4 sleeping children into a different room. The hotel manager did very little to compensate us for our inconvenience. Overall, I’d have to say that I can’t recommend this hotel…unless of course they fix the pest problem.

After carefully reading reviews on TripAdvisor, I booked through the resort directly and requested a room on a high floor, away from the restaurant. We wound up on the 10th floor with a park view (I was told the ocean views are all close to the nearby restaurant which several TripAdvisor reviewers said was very noisy) and we really enjoyed the view of the park and the high rise buildings of Waikiki. No complaints about restaurant noise though Waikiki is a busy city so there was noise (lots of ambulances) throughout the night but as long as we kept the windows closed, it was fine.The room was tastefully decorated with an island theme but I do have one complaint: It's hard to call these rooms condos. They are basically one hotel room with a kitchen decked out with everything you would need for a one-week stay in Waikiki. The rooms are a bit small when you factor in the kitchen but we did book a standard room so perhaps the property offers other options (at a higher price). The beds were comfortable, the TV large, a nice amount of drawer space, the shower was OK (some problems with hot water), the service at the front desk was excellent (kudos to Malia at the Travel Desk - very friendly and helpful) and maid service was fair though our tile floor was never vacuumed and we had tracked in quite a bit of sand. We loved the postcards and free postage we were given upon check-in the and hotel gift shop offers a decent selection of souvenirs.Parking is an issue everywhere in Waikiki so, if you are planning on spending most of the time in the city, I would forgo the rental car. We did rent a car to explore the island and learned that the hotel does not have enough parking spaces for all of their guests. We had to park across the street and about a block away (near Nike Town) - not a bad walk. Whether you park at the hotel or the overflow lot, you will pay $15 per day so you really can save some money by relying on public transportation (the hotel is located within walking distance of great shopping and restaurants so bring some comfortable shoes).Other tips: Nick's Fishmarket right across the street is very unassuming from the exterior but was our favorite meal of the trip. Keo's, also located across the street, has excellent breakfast options at reasonable prices. Outrigger Luana is located very close to the Hilton Hawaiian Village - only a 10-minute walk - and the beautiful beaches in front of the Hilton are open to anyone so check those out (great swimming and views of Diamond Head).","Boston, Massachusetts","Erika F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",33,4.0

We wished we could have been here longer. Excellent value. We paid $145 per night; we originally reserved a studio with kitchen, partial ocean view. When we arrived, we were upgraded to a one bedroom with kitchen, partial ocean view for free. The room is clean and modern, with granite counters, a full kitchen with all the dishes you would need to prepare any meal, clean bathroom, lots of storage space and a great view of the ocean and park. There is a pool and laundry area for guests. We wished there was internet access, but there is a kiosk with a few computers in the second floor lobby ($5 for 30 minutes). Since we work in consulting, we need to be able to check messages! The resort is near a beautiful park with views of the ocean, and it is only about three blocks from the luxury shops of Waikiki. It is about a 10 minute walk to Waikiki beach, and you pass many luxury shops as well as at least three or four large shopping malls and many restaurants from nice chain restaurants like Cheesecake Factory to more upscale dinining in the luxury hotels. Some of the reviews mention fan noise from the restaurant next door. Yes, it is true there is noise, but we were not bothered by it. We wanted to have the air on anyway, and did not hear the fan in our room when we had the doors closed. Don't worry about the fans when you stay here, it is not a bother unless you like to keep your windows open all night. But, it is just white noise. This is definitely worth the value.

We booked a one bedroom suite (city/park view).The exterior of the hotel was not overly impressive...but this was quickly forgotten when we checked in & were told we'd been upgraded to a two bedroom suite for free (they must have over-booked the one bedroom suites). They told us the two bedroom suite they were putting us in had been recently renovated.We were thrilled with our suite! It was MUCH nicer than we expected, & it was HUGE! We had 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, washer/dryer, tons of closet space, a full kitchen, 2 small lanais off of the bedrooms, plus a HUGE patio off of the living room that looked out over the park & the city.The bed was not the most comfortable that I've ever slept in, but was typical of hotel beds. Parking in the garage below the hotel was VERY limited, although we were lucky enough to find spaces every night. Other than that, everything was terrific. The staff was friendly & helpful the few times we approached them, our suite was well-appointed & clean, maid service was reliable, it was quiet at night, high-speed Internet access on the mezzanine level, free newspapers, etc. There are several restaurants nearby, as well as stores where you can buy food to prepare back in your room/suite. It's about a 10 min. walk to the beach, but it's a nice walk by/through the park, & it feels safe, even at night.NOTE - this is a condo hotel, & from what I understand, the units are privately-owned.

Check-in was a breeze and we managed to get a room on the 15th floor. Let me tell you, the view was absolutely amazing! You are situated right next to beautiful Ft DeRussy Park and it's just such a serene sight. When you head outside the hotel you can walk through the park (or down to the next block which leads you to the Outriffer Reef) and you're only about 5-10 minutes from the beach. The great thing about the Luana is that it is right at the start of the Kalakaua strip. It's not as busy and as hectic as some of the other ""bigger"" hotels. Right across the street from the Luana is a nice statue of King Kalakaua and there is an ABC store right there (one of about 100 on the strip!). Also I would recommend Keos restaurant across the street, absolutely great Thai food!The room itself was cozy, if not a little dark as some others had mentioned. Only other weird thing was that there was an armoire in front of the bed where the TV should have been. Minor complaint since when you're in Waikiki the TV is the last concern, but still. The kitchenette came in handy when you're storing drinks and microwaving leftovers from the great restaurants.The only real complaints outside of the room are the lack of restaurants in the hotel and the noise. As I mentioned before, the noise isn't really that bad. It's only a hinderance if you want to have a picnic on the balcony or something like that. With the patio door closed it's really not noticeable. The lack of restaurants was my only legit qualm, but thats the price you pay to stay at a nice condo without the fuss of all the bigger resorts.I would highly recommend the Luana to anyone. Absolutely a great bargain for what you get. If you're looking for world class amenities then you'll want to look more central strip on the oceanfront.
