Unlike most of other hotels in Tokyo, the room is fairly big for the 3 of us and for 3 big luggages. It’s clean and comfortable. The location is also good, just 1 stop from the Tokyo Station. Surrounding is more quiet compared to the other busiest hotels in Tokyo which we normally stayed before. Hence, we liked it very much, not crowded like in other places. Nearby this hotel, we can find many restaurants and convenient stores. Front Desk people are very friendly and helpful. Overall, we had a very good stay in this hotel and will definitely come back to stay here whenever we have another opportunities to visit Tokyo.","Jakarta, Indonesia","Ria900</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jakarta, Indonesia</strong>",32,4.0

Probably the key thing I'd say is that they've thought of everything. Microwaves and vending machines (including a booze vending machine!) and ice mean that if you want to get dinner from 7-11 (this is very much 'a thing' in Japan, and is perfectly tasty) and eat in, you can. Being British, we valued having a fridge so we could make tea, too. And they've got whole racks of toiletries available, in addition to what's in the room. The hotel provides you with pretty much everything you could want.it's also a spacious place. We stayed in a standard double room and it was really very spacious, with plenty of room to set up laptop and suitcases. They provide dimensions for the rooms online, which is helpful (again, this is a thing in Japan).But do note: the double bed really is a double, and not a queen/king. Hotel Sardonyx is about a 15-20 minute walk from Tokyo station, but it is across the road from Hatchobori station, from which you can access the underground network and get anywhere. It's also about 15-20 minutes from the Tokyo airport limousine bus - which is well worth the extra 500 yen compared to the cost of taking trains. Breakfast included western and non-western options, which I really liked. Pickled veg is tough work in the morning, but who knew dim sum and fried noodles for breakfast would be so tasty?!Book with confidence.

Since we like the close vicinity to Ginza, Tokyo station and Tsukiji and away from the noisy area, we chose this hotel. As it turned out, this was one of the best mid-scale hotels in Tokyo we’ve stayed so far. The previous reviews on TripAdvisor assured their accuracy.LocationThe hotel is located right by the subway station of Hachobori. Across from the hotel is a 24-hour convenience store and next to it is a drug store. On the ground floor there is a kind of American style diner with a menu full of pictures. It is also a 15-min walking distance to Tokyo station. A few subway stops away from Ginza. Taxis are easy to catch on every street corner. We stayed on the 2nd floor right above the street, but we did not hear any noise from the street. Since there are mainly offices in Hachobori, it’s quiet all day and on the weekend you hardly see people. There are a lot of good and cheap eateries targeting businessmen for lunch and dinner nearby.Front staffI was impressed by the language skill of the front staff. There was no miscommunication, which can happen a lot in Japan, and the staff was always friendly and attentive to our small demands. Once we asked for children’s PJ, and they really had a set and they even came with cute slippers! Another day, I complained that the washlet in the toilet was not working. 1 hour later it was already fixed. Since it was a Halloween season, there was a game for children to collect Halloween items hidden in the lobby. My child was thrilled about the game and happy when the front desk staff gave a bag of cute Japanese snacks as a gift. The hotel makes an effort to please even the smallest guests. We also appreciated that we could leave our luggages before check in and while we were away for the weekend trip without extra charge. RoomThe room is smaller than the photo but is practically designed. The amenities are minimum, but there is a shelf in the lobby with all sorts of giveaway amenities like bath salt, makeup remover or cotton pad. One thing we missed in the room was the storage space for our big suitcases. WiFi was not as fast as back at home. Since we mostly spent time outside the hotel sightseeing, we did not mind the small room size.We will definitely come back here on our future trip to Japan and recommend this hotel to other travelers as well.","Zurich, Switzerland","1Springsummer1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Zurich, Switzerland</strong>",65,5.0

We scored a night at Hotel Sardonyx on the cheap side through Agoda and were pleasantly suprised when we checked-in.We were greeted with a smile by some friendly staff who allowed us to check-in to our room a couple of hours early. They also held our bags after check-out while we got our last few hours to wander around Tokyo.The room was the biggest surprise. After nights in small, compact apartments, we expected another cramped space. This was not the case though. We had opened the door to an incredibly spacious and tidy room - we hit the jackpot with this deal. It had a great sized bed, couch, table and wall mounted TV with ample space to still move around comfortably. The bathroom was also very generous with a nice sized bath. Everything was clean and well maintained.Hotel Sardonyx Tokyo is about a 15 minute walk from Tokyo station, however you can catch the Keiyo Line or Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line to Hatchobori station and take an exit that is literally a minute walk to the hotel. We found the Hibiya Line convenient to get to places like Akihabara or to transfer to other lines to get to the busier places like Shinjuku and Shibuya, all of which were about a 15-20 minute ride. The area in which the hotel is located seems to be more of a business district so it was relatively quiet on the Sunday we stayed with not much happening at night.

If weather is good and you don't have too much luggage it is very convenient. Hatchobori station is just a minute away. It is also just a few metro stops to Disney. Convenience stores Lawsons and Family mart are just outside. A supermarket is also nearby.Room - thoroughly cleaned, spacious and comfortable.Amenities - very convenient to get some ice cubes, buy drinks at vending machines and do your laundry at selected floors. Washing your clothes needs at least 200yen and drying 100 yen.Front desk - very helpful and friendly. I mistakenly booked a smoking room and was not able to get a new room since they were fully booked. Once a non-smoking room was available two days later, they called and asked if I wanted to change which of course I did. Restaurants - there are a few restaurants outside. For simple Japanese food, we were happy with the food from Denny's and Jonathan's. They offer western food as well. If you want sushi or yakiniku, ask the front desk. They have a list of restaurants nearby.ConsBreakfast - the food is the same every day. So if you are staying for more than two days, skip breakfast here and go to Jonathan's or Denny's. Or buy something simple at Lawsons. TipsBath salts, male and female toiletries, masks, and few items are available for free at the lobby. Imperial Garden where the Palace is located is at least 15 minute walk from hotel. Walk straight to Tokyo station and find the Manchouri Line exit. Taking the metro from Hatchobori will take you almost the same time since you need to transfer lines.

The Japanese convenience stores are numerous in this area and are the perfect stop for all your needs, some of my favorite meals in Japan are the sandwiches and bento boxes which are so fresh they are restocked twice a day, and if you want your bento heated up they'll do that too. If you are into shopping, a short distance away is the Ginza with everything you could ever dream of.

We were greeted by polite staff upon our arrival. I was concerned if the room would not be as big as shown on the booking site, for it was stated as 'Small double room', but, it turned out that the room was spacious and comfortable! Not only it has a double bed, it could accomodate an L-shaped writing table and a long couch by the window. We asked for a higher floor room facing the river and we were given it. The room was also very clean.Besides complimentary toiletries in the room, the hotel also stocked up a shelf full of complimentary skin care products, and tea sachets at the lobby.There were also complimentary newspapers in English and Japanese near the lift lobby. There is a cafe at first floor that has a cosy setting. It starts its business as early as 6.30am, but we did not give it a try due to our short stay.There is no airport transfer service for this hotel, despite being given the option on the 3rd party booking website. However, the hotel staff was helpful in giving us direction. A 5min taxi ride (cost merely 570¥) brought us to the limousine bus terminal to both Narita and Haneda airports. If you hold a foreign passport, you can get bus tickets at 1900¥ instead of 3000¥. Bus leaves every 15minutes, and takes about an hour to reach Narita airport.If you prefer a hotel located at the quieter side of the city, near to a train station, plus spacious room with reasonable price, this is it. We will choose this hotel again.","Singapore, Singapore","AdelG5</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",34,5.0

The hotel is modern, clean, near Tokyo station, and has very large rooms, especially for Japan. Our semidouble room had a double bed, as well as a sitting area with couch and coffee table, giving us a ton of room to unpack our bags and relax. The bed is a bit firm but on par with most Japanese hotels, making it comfortable enough.  It’s in a quiet business area east of Tokyo station, not much of a sightseeing neighbourhood. However it’s an easy walk to Tokyo station, the Tsukiji fish market, and Ginza. It’s a great place to stay when you first arrive in Tokyo as your jet lag will likely have you up early making it the perfect time to head to the Tsukiji fish market.  To get to Tokyo station it’s about a 15 minute walk or a 5 minute subway ride. We found the walk very reasonable, though it may not be ideal for those who don’t like to walk as much.  Overall this is an excellent place to stay, I would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Tokyo as long as they don’t need the busy city right at their door.","Alberta, Canada","jessba</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alberta, Canada</strong>",27,5.0

Do you feel that the guest's room rate should get such a dirty room? Don't you worry that your hotel affects foreigners' good impression of Japan as a whole?1.the first day of staying at hotels, not even slippers in the room.2.See the hotel is outdated, some parts have been damaged, such as table feet, curtains, cloakroom, tissue box ... also did not get timely repair,It is important that even old is acceptable, but dirty is should never happen.3. The dust in the room is very big, turn on the lights to see the piles of dust in the light back and forth fluttering, open the curtains to see a pile of dust flying in front of curtain.the fingers touch with many parts are thick on the dust, the sofa, the fridge, the windowsill, the table, the bed's head, the toilet, the phone, the alarm clock, and even the air purifier is all thick dust, with your fingers touched, are thick a layer, simply can not imagine, in the streets of Japan, with seats, handrails, car tires ... are very clean, but in the room of Sardonyx Tokyo there are so many dust.I did not even big mouth breathing, because of fear of inhaling too much dust.4. The wallpaper, the cabinet, bedspread, faucet behind... There are a lot of stains, can also be blood.5. The dust in the air purifier outlet is very big, so use air purifier make the room air worse instead.6. Air conditioning and ventilation fans sound great, and the vent is full of dust.7. The microwave oven which is in the public part is also very dirty, a lot of stains, grease.8. Hotel information that for security, the windows have been locked, can not open, can not be ventilated, but we have seen some other room windows are open, very strange.9.Hotel downstairs is a bridge, in the bridge and the road on the ground connection, whenever the vehicle through, will be issued a loud noise, but the hotel has a large window of the gap, not sealed, no sound insulation, We live in the 8th floor can be very clear to hear the sound, it is difficult to imagine how the downstairs guests can sleep.10.During our stay, the refrigerator suddenly leaked a lot of water one day, and I chose to dry it by myself.11.Pajamas provided, did not consider the guests body size,are all small size pajamas.  More information and details, I have uploaded photos.  On the third day after the stay, finally unbearable, we contacted the front desk staff, we would like to ask her to come to our room to see the situation and face to face communication, but she can not personally come to our room,she only sent a cleaning staff who could only speak Japanese and could not communicate with us by language come to our room, and we have to use body language to tell the cleaning staff the room was very dirty, the cleaner kept nodding, but after we returned to my room at night, we found that only a few parts has been cleaned up, most other parts Is still very dirty.Because we don't understand Japanese, English is also general, and the daily energy spent on tourism, So we do not have sufficient capacity, and full time and energy to continue to communicate with the hotel.  we have returned home for 7 days, but that The room is full of dust and stains scene has been in my eyes flashed, one by one question emerge in my heart,you did not do your job well, is your dereliction of duty.

The staff at the hotel were lovely. We were greeted upon arrival and were checked into our room quickly and without any fuss. I've stayed at 5 star hotels in Asia in the past and have had to wait much longer to be checked-in upon being served. We stayed on the sixth floor. The hotel is small so each floor has different amenities. Our floor had vending machines which stocked a selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and an ice machine. Other floors had microwaves and laundry facilities. We never used those so I can't say what they were like unfortunately. There are no fitness or gym facilities at this hotel. Our room was small but comfortable with a low double bed, writing desk, sofa and luggage compartment. There is a very small closet with room for six pieces of clothing. Under the bedside table is a programmable safe. The room has reverse-cycle air conditioning as well. Other room amenities included free wifi, a TV (only Japanese language stations), a kettle, tea and coffee, cups and glasses, shoe shining/cleaning equipment, fabric deodoriser, robes and slippers. There was a small bathroom attached with a bath/shower combo and a toilet (including the obligatory space-age Japanese toilet seat). Bathroom amenities included a hairdryer, razors, toothbrush/toothpaste, hair brush, disposable face cloth and cotton tips. The shower was small but had good water pressure. Shower gel, shampoo and conditioner were also provided. Importantly the bathroom was very clean and the cleaning staff do a great job. During our stay we requested extra pillows and they were delivered promptly and at no extra cost. The hotel is an easy 15 minute stroll from Tokyo Station and is within easy walking distance from three different metro lines. Hatchobori Station is a minute away while Nihombashi, Takaracho and Kyobashi stations are no more than 10 minutes walk away. There are a variety of convenience stores located nearby (Lawsons and Family Mart are both across the road). Our room rate included breakfast which is served in a Royal Host restaurant next to the lobby. It is open to the public and seemed to be a common place for local business people to meet. Despite that we never had trouble getting a seat regardless of the time we started breakfast. Breakfast was a buffet and included a small selection of Japanese, Chinese and Western cuisines. All in all we enjoyed our stay at the hotel Sardonyx and would definitely stay again. The only negative that we experienced was the occasional noise. It can sometimes be busy on weekday mornings and evenings and the noise filters into the rooms.

The building and the the decor is modern without being cold. The location is great: 15 min walk to Tokyo Station (where Shinkanzen and all JR trains stop), 4 minutes from the nearest metro. There is a family mart across the street and we also found a great restaurant just around the corner (Kyushu style).

This means that if you do not bring your own Wireless router (and most sane travels dont) your foreign ipad will be useless. 2. I would not recommend the breakfast add-on option given at the front desk. You prepay for these services and after day 1 you will want to give this breakfast a miss. 3. There is no Gym in the facility or nearby. If a fitness center is extremely important to your travels you will want to stay somewhere else. So, if you have an expectation of ""No Frills"" and need a place close to transit this is a great spot and would recommend to any passer-through.

If you get lost (as we did), you should be able to find a person who can direct you to Coredo Nihonbashi, as it's a very large building -- part offices and part restaurants.The room was large (by Tokyo standards!) with a wooden entryway. They gave us an excellent room (maybe because we told them it was our honeymoon?) -- we were on the top floor, and woke up to discover our room overlooked a very beautiful canal. The bedding was very comfortable, and the bathroom, while somewhat small, was fully packed with amenities (toliet with bidet and seat warmer, shower with self-heating tub) and freebies (toothbrushes, toothpaste, wash cloths, razors, travel brushes, bath salts, slippers). They also provided very comfy pajamas to wear.The staff was very friendly and bid us good morning or good evening every time we were in the lobby. We felt extremely welcome and comfortable at the hotel, and there were a few other English-speaking foreigners staying there as well that we got to talk with. We can't wait to visit Tokyo again, and we'll definitely be staying at the Hotel Sardonyx again when we do!","Birmingham, Alabama","katmcgo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, Alabama</strong>",4,5.0
