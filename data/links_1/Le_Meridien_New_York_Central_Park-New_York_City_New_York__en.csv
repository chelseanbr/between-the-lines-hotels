The front desk welcome, the doorman, the housekeeper, and overall tone of the people in the property was uniquely positive and made the stay feel like home. I haven't seen that with many NY hotels I've used in the past few years. The concierge was especially helpful when I needed to leave early and was unable to return to NYC. He helped pack up my things and ship my luggage to my home, since I wasn't able to return to the city. Chris Carrow was very willing to help in an unusual way, it would have been easy to say ""NO"". He went the extra mile to help me out. This is my first trip adviser review, but it's also the first time that I've had service that deserves a public positive note.",,I2522OWtoml,0,5.0

To top off our great stay, they brought up two free beers. Don't forget about the traveler appreciation happy hour from 5-7 where they will have free glasses of wine and beer. I've seen a few comments about the furnishings, and while they are a little dated, they are classic mid-century pieces that are solid, clean pieces. They may have a little wear from over the years, but nothing was in disrepair. The bathroom was fully modern and upgraded, and the bed was new, comfortable, and fresh.

I travel all the time and am a Marriott titanium elite member - not that this hotel cares. First off, thought I had booked Le Parker Méridien but it appears that in 2019 that it was bought by Hyatt and the le meridian moved next door into a hole in the wall building. There is basically no lobby, no lobby ba, no nothing. The staff isn’t rude but they are insanely clueless and inattentive. I booked a one bedroom suite. The size of the room is the only nice thing I can say about this place. You can hear people showering when you are in the nasty hallway. The windows are so sold that it was like sleeping outdoors it was so cold. They gave me two Rinky dinky towels for the entire suite. Had nothing to dry off with in the morning. Most annoying thing was when I took the time to go through the room service menu to order breakfast and called down to order, they told me that menu doesn’t exist anymore and I had a selection of a muffin or a muffin. They told me it was because the restaurant is beiMy renovated. So I went downstairs and the restaurant is fully open. I asked if I could get breakfast to go for my room and they said no, it was 35 dollar buffet. No thanks. Went across street to get breakfast sandwich at a deli. Normally the front desk always asks how your stay was when you check out but I can see why this front desk didn’t ask.","Atlanta, Georgia","Traveltoomuch22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",4,1.0

As it stands in January 2020, the property is definitely not at Le Méridien’s standards. However, I will absolutely return to this property when I am in New York.What makes this property incredible: The PeopleEvery interaction that I had, from check-in, to getting acquainted, lobby staff interactions, bar / restaurant staff - the people are incredible. I felt like a valuable family member the entire time I was there, and that is the top memory that I carry from my first stay at this property.The estheticsKnowing that the complete renovation is imminent, my opinions are very lenient on this point. The hard product is very worn, dark, and not at all what you expect from a Le Méridien property. This will change, so give it a chance. Right now, the rooms feel awkward, dark, but still everything is very comfortable and I will stay here again even before renovations. Remember, this is New York City, spaces can be cramped so don’t expect a bathroom the size of one that you might find in Atlanta or Miami for example. The lobby has already been renovated so it is very warm and comfortable when you arrive, especially on those chilly and brisk New York winter days. Two elevators serve the 29 floors so waiting for a lift is very quick.If you’re staying here before the renovation - yes the rooms feel dark, the surfaces feel worn and old, but this will change soon.Food & BeverageThis was the biggest weakness for the Le Méridien brand. Please note - I did not experience room service (maybe I should have, perhaps next time).The restaurant off the lobby on the ground floor is called Kingside. As of January 2019 this restaurant is only available for breakfast. So I have not had a chance to try this space. Even being in the middle of Midtown New York, we need a full service restaurant at this property.On the 29th floor, there is a very charming bar called Rooftop, and part of it is indoors and outdoors (during my stay the outdoor section was covered, and had heat lamps). This is where I had my worst, most non-Le Méridien experience.Again I say, the people at Rooftop are incredible, very accommodating and warm. I learned my first night that the food & beverage management company had just recently changed, and here is the new menu. Two nights later, nothing on that menu is available. Instead, a very limited selection of food is offered (eg., olives, cheese & crackers, French fries, salmon toast), all which are very expensive. I ordered the cheese & crackers and the French fries which were completely unacceptable. The fries were soggy and limp, the cheese was served walk-in cold and just not good. I did have a very positive conversation with Juan, who rectified my invoice, and was very open to my feedback. I hope that the next time, there is an improvement.Overall : B-Room: BFood & Bev: D+",Atlanta,"Bradley D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta</strong>",4,3.0

During our visit, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Definitely beyond what I usually get at a NYC hotel. For example, the concierge happily printed my theater tickets when I realized I couldn't use a mobile option. The location was great - easy walking distance to Central Park, 5th Avenue, Times Square. Rooms were clean and comfortable, with just the right Art Deco touches. After we left, my daughter realized she left a small bag with medicine in her hotel room. When I called, the staff said they would contact security for me. I didn't hold out much hope - it had been two days. But they called back to tell me that they located the bag and would send it to me.

We were disappointed. The pros are few: friendly staff and great location. The cons were the hotel itself and the breakfast. The hotel is outdated, dark, rundown, and needs renovation badly. See the photos. It is like someone’s den from the 70’s with old furniture and outdated lighting that is not bright at all and makes the room feel cave-like. There is ugly brown carpet and stained wood furniture (I attached just one photo of the stained/marked furniture, but took more than that). The desk is literally bolted to the floor. The light fixtures are awful and provide little light. The hallways are dark and dreary and look like a cheap hotel. I have stayed in hotels in lower categories and had much nicer rooms and decor. It is worth mentioning that the photos on the Marriott website, where I booked, made the rooms look light and bright. They are not.We booked a 1 bedroom suite with Central Park view. Not sure what room Marriott took the central park view picture from, but we were on the 22nd floor and had the view in the photo attached. There are 27 floors and I don’t see how going up five floors higher or to the left or right gets the unobstructed view shown in Marriott’s photo on their website. (it was very foggy the day I took the photo, so not the best shot, but you can see that the view is buildings with Central Park visible beyond.) We are Marriott members so had a special rate that included breakfast. I would not recommend spending extra for the breakfast. The cost of it is $35 per person and $15 for a child. It is a buffet, so chafing dishes of scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, and sausage. Also cold cereals, bagels, bread to toast, fruit, and yogurt with granola. Juice and coffee included. Does it sound almost exactly like a free breakfast at a Residence Inn? It is almost the same in selection and quality, but $35 per person. Our rate to have breakfast included was $40 or $50 more versus a room rate without breakfast (can’t recall exactly), so we weren’t actually paying the $35 per person, but the breakfast was not worth the extra money. Really disappointing considering we could have gone to a restaurant and had much better breakfast for less than what we paid. In sum, we would not stay here again and would t recommend to friends. Marriott really needs to spend some money here!","Philadelphia, PA","lookingforhome</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, PA</strong>",101,2.0

The interior design is charming with wrought-iron mirrors, messing rain-shower, nice tiling. Charming little Illy coffee machine with complimentary coffee capsules. As our neighbour was very noisy and clearly very drunk, shouting aggressively, we did not get a lot of sleep the first night, but the staff reacted to this promptly and adequately by sending someone up to deal with the matter.

And while that part of town is charming around the holidays, the surge pricing of hotels rooms is anything but... In the past years I've stayed at The London NYC, but since its being renovated, I was looking for something similar, in the same price range: homey, not corporate, charming and high-end. From the website, Le Meridian seemed comparable, so I booked a room there for this year's trip and was totally disappointed. Knowing we'd be arriving after midnight, I made sure there was a note in our reservation to hold our room and called twice beforehand to ensure it would be. Of course, when we arrived at 1:30AM, our room had been given away and the only room available was the last one in the hotel - room 203 - which is unfit for guests. It has two double beds (not queens) with ill-fitting sheets, no furniture, no alarm clock, no remote and hadn't been cleaned. Ugh. Just to add insult to injury, the people at the desk tried to convince me that this room was actually an upgrade (!!!) and charged $799 for the night ($200 more than the king room we had booked). They knew they were putting lipstick on a pig. We were moved to a king on a higher floor the next day. And while that room was fine, it was tiny and the compressor for the heater kept having to be reset, so it was freezing. The staff is friendly. The lobby is lovely. The Roof was closed for private parties every night we were there (second week of December, so understandable). It's very convenient to where I have to be for work meetings. The Art Deco vibe is charming in the common areas and maybe in the larger guest rooms, but the rooms we stayed in were old and dinky.

It was never received, which is fine, but I don’t think hotel staff should make claims and not follow through. I also had SEVERAL issues with bell services.

We opted not to stay with family at their 8th Ave and 14th St property, but instead made reservations at Le Meridien 57th St Central Park South. I've been a Marriott brand property loyalist for the past 5 years. As a consultant I spend approximately 72% of my time on travel in hotels, and I've come to expect quality service and impeccable accommodations from Marriott. The Le Meridien New York, Central Park property was amazing. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by professional staff eager to welcome us to the property. Check-in was swift and efficient. I've ambassador elite status, and was excited to have received a suite upgrade. I had no idea what was in store for us. As we entered the 27th floor suite, the massive glass windows filled the suite with brilliant sweeping Central Park Autumn foliage views. Setting our bags down, we walked through the rooms to make note of the accommodations. The suite was impressive. The enlarged bedroom also offered panoramic views of Central Park. The bedroom had a wall-mounted television, firm and comfortable mattress, as well as vintage designed features and fixtures. As we walked through the pocket doors into the bathroom foyer, dual sinks recessed into granite countertops finished with charming brass fixtures were to our left, walled off separate walk-in closet and toilet were to our front, and a massive open glass walled shower to our right. The enormous bathroom space was filled with natural light from a raised porthole window. The space allocated to the bathroom area by no means compromised any of the suite's vast living space. Back in the main living space were vintage designed sofa and chairs, stools, tables, and lighting fixtures. The space also featured a workspace, elevated buffet table, and a tailored minibar with complimentary and for purchase-items. The kitchenette featured an enlarged bar sink, Illy coffee maker, and glass door mini-fridge. The mini-fridge was stocked with non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages for purchase. Every detail of the suite was carefully designed to give an eclectic feel but with modern amenities. Taking it all in, we realized we weren't in a hotel, but rather an apartment tailored to provide a fashioned vintage experience. I would be remiss if I didn't comment about ""The Roof"". It's the Le Meridien's New York City rooftop lounge. It too was impressive with sweeping views of Central Park and the surrounding skyline. It featured outdoor (covered) and indoor lounge areas, comfortable seating, ambience, and was serviced by professional staff and populated with polite patrons. In my opinion and experience staying at Marriott properties, I'd say the Le Meridien 57th St Central Park is my favorite. It is not a cookie cutter property to house guests, but instead offered us an unparalleled quality of life and comfortable experience. I would encourage anyone looking to feel at home in New York City to stay at the Le Meridien 57th St Central Park. My wife and I will return.","Atlanta, Georgia","casasmt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",9,5.0

When we arrived and found a new hotel brand name on the door I joked to my wife, “I assume they transferred the reservation...”. I shouldn’t have joked. When Melissa at the front desk furrowed her brow at her screen, I knew what was coming: “It appears your reservation was canceled out of the system.” After first declining to be squeezed into a double-double, I pressed for two rooms to make up for the error. Thankfully, Melissa and the hotel were able to accommodate me, and they honored the original price. Melissa was calm and helpful, and the manager stepped in to ensure everything was copacetic. The hotel staff went out of their way to make sure the many marathoners on property felt encouraged and welcomed, which was nice. The only downside we found during our two night stay was the buffet breakfast at Kingside, the onsite restaurant. It was anemic: a couple of trays of pastries and bagels, a picked-over bowl of fruit (with those little fruit gnats buzzing around it) and a near empty at 8am chafing dish with standard eggs, potatoes, sausage, and bacon. Nothing fancy or special - and entirely adequate for a reasonable price. $30 per person is not a reasonable price for scrambled eggs and potatoes, even in NYC. Until they up the breakfast game, pick one of the several restaurants in easy walking distance.

I picked it for a couple of reasons but mostly because of the decor and fantastic views of Central Park. When the property was bought out by the Marriott and became the Le Meridien, they transitioned everything over seamlessly and honored our reservations, as well as the hotel block and group rate. When I had toured the property as the Viceroy, I was shown the rooftop bar and deck which has amazing views of Central Park. I really wanted photos on our wedding day from here capturing the city. I later found out that the rooftop is separately owned/operated and I received a little bit of a hard time gaining access for photos. The staff at the Le Meridien still made sure my request was taken care of and organized roof access for me to have photos taken up there (Thank you Tyler!). The front desk employees were incredibly nice, friendly, helpful and accommodating. Overall, everyone at the hotel really did everything to make sure I was taken care of on our special day. We also ate at the Kingside restaurant in the lobby. We were pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was. I stayed in the penthouse suite which was insanely gorgeous. Probably the nicest hotel room I have ever been in. I did have family and friends in king and double rooms, which were also nice for a standard room. Yes the rooms are on the smaller side, but welcome to New York. Everything in New York is on the smaller side.

Come to find out, a few years ago the hotel was divided in the middle of the two blocks, with the 57th street part of it becoming Le Meridien, a Marriott hotel, and the 56th St part of it becoming the Parker Hotel, a Hyatt property. Must be that all the good rooms ended in the Parker Hotel, because from our own experience (and the other reviews posted on Tripadvorr) I would venture that there are no good rooms on the Le Meridien side of the former Parker Meridien. Now we paid using Marriott points, but when I checked the price on the web for Saturday,Oct 12, it was a little over $600, and if I had paid that for this little enclosure with poor water pressure, I might have ended up jail. Next time we'll try the Parker, so check back for my posts in a few months for a comparison.

Room was tiny but functional and well appointed. Checked out the rooftop bar. Was palatable early in the evening but descended into DJ din for the mostly Millennial clientele as the night wore on. Nice park views. Even though I scored an outstanding AAA rate of $205/night, I can’t give the property five stars. The connecting doors between rooms presented challenges for sleeping late or turning in early. Small children’s voices and their parents’ cackles could be heard from the suite next door. Almost called the front desk when a guest in the same suite decided to kick the connecting door for no reason. The sink and shower stall did not drain properly. The interior corridors were dark and depressing. The HVAC system cycled on and off so frequently that I had to completely turn it off.

But there were little flying bugs in the washroom (which sometimes flew into the main room). When taking a shower, I found myself in increasingly high standing water: the drain in the shower did not work. How did the cleaning staff miss that (didn’t they clean the shower)? Some of the things could have easily been caught by hotel staff (smoke smell, clogged shower drain). I’m surprised that a hotel of this caliber came up short on so many things.

The room was ""cozy"" as booked, clean with new carpet, full of slightly worn but interesting art Deco wood furnishings and tiled bathroom, both of which add character and I hope are to be refreshed but not replaced.

Reception (VJ especially)was friendly, helpful, and extended our check out an hour to have breakfast.
