Rented this studio condo as part of an add-on after reserving the flight. Said it could fit four... it was quite a tight fix but acceptable. The bed seemed to be a double as it was quite small for 2 people. The couch opened up so two additional people could fit. There were adequate kitchen utensils, cups and plates. Also enough blankets, pillows and towels provided. It was all very clean and well kept. Parking was also included in the price.The location was terrific, lots of places to eat and shop right downstairs and in the many blocks around us. It was about 3 blocks to the beach.The only negative was the live bands playing at a bar on the street one over from the hotel. We had a room on the 17th floor in back. The continuous AC blocked most of the music.Would consider staying there again, with fewer people.

And twice every morning all of the dumpsters in the area were slammed around up and down the street directly below our room. and to make it worse, there were un-sealed, wooden louvers instead of window pane for one of the windows, letting in every sound outside.

And it left a sour taste in my mouth, indeed. Not that I get the impression most people in management (anywhere in Oahu) actually care. It was 5:30 in the morning and the parking garage was virtually empty - 9 open spaces - next to the McDonalds where I was hoping to run into so I could bring my elderly mother some orange juice as a reward for getting up for an early flight. I was in McDonalds a total of 6 minutes. And I assure you, with 9 open parking spaces at 5:30 in the morning, not a human being on Earth was remotely disturbed by my action. But it didn't stop Haole from literally screaming at me and telling me to move my car. So I moved it to the street and picked up my orange juice to go - and left. But I left scarred by his unnecessary behavior. Where I live, if it is 5:30 AM and someone wants to use one of 9 open parking spaces to pick up their to-go order and are in the space for fewer than 6 minutes, I would gladly tell them I'd watch their car to make sure it all went smoothly. That's what's called being human. I get that during busy times, what I was doing at the Marine Surf parking space might have presented an issue - and I would not have tried. But at 5:30 AM? Get REAL. And try and find some of that spirit that the islands insist are part of their unique culture. This fellow belongs in a prison setting - not hospitality.

Sadly we have stayed in this building before and it was very nice but it has deteriorated into oblivion. The sad thing is there are many owners of condos in this building however many if not all of the rooms are connected with air vents that run through the units. These are infested with cockroaches that move throughout the building. In the past they must have treated the building but we spoke to many different people who were renting units and they all said it was infested. If you turned the lights on at night suddenly, there were dozens of roaches on the counter tops, all over the refrigerator, microwave, walls above the bed, and in the bathrooms. We went out and purchased supplies to counter the infestation but we could never stay ahead of them. The entire building is infested. We have been to the islands over 20 times and now were not sure where we will stay next time. In the last few years prices have doubled and tripled and paying that much for a slum condo is not acceptable. The older reviews will be pretty accurate but lately it really has been awful. Best of luck to you all and be careful.

The studio was clean, the owner even left us a little gift of aloha, pancake mix. Very thoughtful. There were some bugs in the kitchen, and we rinsed off all the cups before using it to make tea but nothing that ruined our stay. Bathrooms were very clean, no shampoos but that's ok because we brought our own. The bed was extremely lumpy and uncomfortable, and the linens were rough and scratchy... but serviceable.

It was to be our dream vacation to celebrate some important milestones in our lives, our retirements, our 30th wedding anniversary and my weight loss of over 60 lbs. The weather was INCREDIBLE, 15 minutes of drizzle while in Waikiki. This of course was a big plus coming from snow banks in Canada.Our vacation was comprised of two components. From March 6 to March 25th inclusive we stayed in a condo (Ali’i), unit 1907 at the Marine Surf Waikiki, Seaside Avenue, Honolulu which we found through the HomeAway website. The owner of the condo, a true gentlemen by the name of Tom Merrick provided excellent customer service. From the first exchange of email we felt confident that we had made a good choice in choosing to stay in one of his condos. We are new to travelling so I had many questions about staying in a condo for almost three weeks. He was very patient and he would quickly reply to all of my questions. The photos that are on the website are indeed exactly what the condo looks like. The condo was clean and laundry was available directly outside our unit. We had sufficient room in our studio and felt at home. Being provided with free Wifi and free calls to Canada was a big plus as it allowed us to be in touch daily with our family.It is important to note that the remainder of my review is NOT related to our stay in the Marine Surf Waikiki. There are a few issues that I wanted to address. The building has a small pool which I found out closed at 7:00 p.m. I have never stayed anywhere that a pool closes at 7:00 p.m. It was one of my criteria when choosing where to stay for health reasons. I guess it is a question I will ask when vacationing. When you enter the Marine Surf Waikiki there is a seafood restaurant, the Crackin' Kitchen which is packed each and every night. The food must be good however the smell of seafood is an issue should you not like seafood. Fish is a big part of our diet so normally I would tolerate this, but when you enter and exit the lobby each and every day, it gets to be a bit much. You will however not smell it in your room, well at least we didn’t as we were on the 19th floor. Another factor we would definitely pay attention to in the future is NOISE. As it was our first trip to Waikiki/Hawaii we did not know what to expect. True to the information on the website, the Marine Surf Waikiki is but a block from the main ""strip"" where the action happens from morning to night on Kalakaua Avenue. On our previous travels, we had not experienced nor expected being in a location where it is difficult to walk on a street because of the crowds. You are dodging people from 6:00 a.m. till the wee hours of the morning. Both sides of the street are filled with shopping, restaurants, bars and of course the beautiful Waikiki beach. Actually the first week or so it was somewhat exciting to be in the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. But eventually the novelty wore off, we just wanted some peace and quiet, afterall our vacation was also to get some rest which we found difficult. Our sleep was disrupted as you could hear laughter, loud talking, sirens etc. from both Kalakaua and Khulio Avenue. You’re in a great location if you do not mind noise, if you want rest in the evening, you will have difficulty unless you’re a sound sleeper. During our stay there there was also construction directly across the unit so I spent very little time just sitting on the balcony with my morning coffee as it was just too noisy.Yet, overall I would still return to stay at the Waikiki Marine Surf on Seaside Avenue but for a much shorter stay. Everything in Waikiki is overly expensive especially groceries. I almost went into shock when we needed to stock the condo for our stay. Honestly we could not imagine how a family could make ends meet. This trip has taught us that we will not stay in one location for such a long period of time. We rented a car for two days which was too short but at least we saw other parts of Oahu and honestly those two days were the best of our trip. We were able to spend some time on other beautiful beaches, eat incredible shrimp from Giovanni’s shrimp truck, hike two inactive volcanoes etc.","Gatineau, Canada","grandkids20102014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gatineau, Canada</strong>",5,5.0

We always stay at the Miramar at Waikiki hotel, but unfortunately it has been torn down and being replaced by the Saks Fifth Avenue/International Market Place Rejuvenation Project. With the Miramar gone, we had to find a new place to stay. I did a lot of research and came across Marine Surf Waikiki. There are a number of condos that are available as vacation rentals in this building by agencies and private owners. We had to go by availability and I found condo unit #1008.The unit was very efficient and clean and had everything we needed. Having the full fridge and stove was nice especially since we were there for a month. Included with the condo was an assigned parking spot which saved us a lot of money and because it was a designated spot, I liked that we didn't have to hunt for parking like some of the other condo buildings. Also included was wifi and free long distance to Canada and United States...another great convenience. The bed was comfy and the shower had plenty of hot water and great water pressure. I used the pullout sofa bed a couple of nights because my husband wasn't feeling well and I was surprised at how comfortable it was...it has a memory foam mattress instead of the usual spring mattress that sofa beds come with...it was super comfy! Every floor has washer and dryer which you pay for, but I'm glad I didn't have to drag my clothes to the coin laundromat. The only complaint I have is the view wasn't the greatest, but hey...your in Waikiki and your not going to spend all your time in the room right! However, it was perfect for watching the fireworks display that Hilton Hawaiian Village put on every Friday night. One other thing unfortunately was the noise...street noise. We got used to it after a few days and it did quiet down through the night. I'm sure the noise level would be a bit better higher up. The location of the building is right in the center of Waikiki, so you don't have to walk far to the beach (1 block away) and you're in the hub of all the popular restaurants and shops. Oh ya, I also liked that the elevators in the building (2) were very quick. The security at the Marine Surf is great as well. All in all, I found this condo unit and the Marine Surf building to be an excellent choice and I would recommend it to my friends. This vacation rental made our stay in Honolulu a great one!","Oakville, Canada","Linda C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakville, Canada</strong>",19,5.0

We really enjoyed our stay and liked being located in the heart of Waikiki and were in walking distance to many eateries .. Including "" the cheesecake factory"", Starbucks , IHOP,and many places at the mall several blocks away.( also within walking distance), . It was nice to have a clean condo with a microwave , stove/oven, and full sized refrigerator , as we got groceries on the other side of the island in Kailua so we could spare a little expense. Waikiki has pretty expensive prices for even the IHOP or McDonald's ( something that would normally be $3-$4 in the mainland , would cost twice the price in Waikiki. Food prices got a little better as you moved out to Kaneohe and Kailua area . The shower had an upgraded waterfall type shower head and a seperate area with a vanity for getting ready. We found the space to be quite adequate for myself and my husband and I think it would fit a family of 4 comfortably. There is a pay laundry $1.50 to wash and $1.50 to dry) just a few feet away from condo #1907, which was super convenient for us. We also loved that parking was free .. As opposed to most of the hotels in the area that charge $20-$30 a day for parking . All in all , the value for the money was excellent . The owners, Tom , was very nice and was available by phone or text whenever we had questions. The only cons that we had about our stay was that even though we were on the 19 th floor, on Friday and Saturday nights in particular, you could here whooping and hollering from the Tsunami night club directly diagonal from our condo. It went on from about 11 pm to 2 am. There are actually 2 night clubs next to each other. I'm sure every hotel guest within the 2 block radius could hear the music and people yelling. This is not at all the owner's fault, just something to be aware of and maybe bring your iPad and earplugs for the weekend stays. Another thing is that the bed is REALLY firm and super close to the sliding glass door , which , for the person on that side by the window,beware of knocking your ankle against the end of the bedpost ... Not a huge deal.. But something to know before you go. From the balcony, you can see a view of the streets surrounding and several nice high rises . You can also get a view of the beach from afar from the private balcony and if you walk to the end of the 19 th floor, you get a really pretty view of water. I was really happy with the location. The parking garage is a little bit tricky to find .. But we figured it out after a couple of times of driving the route . Make sure you pass Lewers street and then there will be a sign for a condo on your right that says "" 2201"". .. (Can't rememeber the street name )Directly after that , you will turn right and the right into the parking garage. It kind of blends in and is tricky to find . Overall, we highly recommend this rental. It was modern, convenient to local attractions and not far at all from the beach. I would say the walk to the beach is maybe 3/4 of a mile. We spent most of our time exploring the island and checking out a variety of cool places such as The North shore, the dole pineapple plantation, the Byodu-in temple ( a beautiful surprise), hiking diamond head , and snorkeling shark's cove. See my other reviews doe ratings and advice. We felt really safe in our rental, as you had to have a special electronic key fob to ride the elevator and pick your floor. It felt really homey and less crowded than staying in a hotel. Some hints- traffic is crazy from about 5 am - 8:30 am on weekdays and gets crazy also after about 2-3 pm , so we kept this in mind as we ventured out and about.

Best part was it came with it's own parking stall so we were able to rent a car the whole time and use this as our base to visit other places like Diamond Head, Koko Crater, the North Shore, etc. Given that I've experienced commute times of 90 minutes one way, I found that getting almost anywhere on the island easy and not having to worry about parking or the expense if it was great. Contrary to the previous negative review of this same room, we found the room to be clean (not perfect, but clean), the appliances very convenient and the owner Thomas to be very friendly and helpful. The ceiling was standard height so not sure how someone can complain that it's too low. The picture we saw of the room was representative of what it actually was: a room that was about 450-500 sq.ft. in size, a king-size bed, a sofa-bed that we didn't use, a small balcony with a small view of water between buildings, and useful appliances. The ice maker in the fridge/freezer was very helpful as were the other things we could use like coolers, beach towels and beach chairs.

It's just over 10 minutes to the beach and has restaurants, shopping and amenities all around it. The condo was very clean and came with a kitchenette which we used for breakfast only since there were so many dining options nearby. An electronic key opened the main door, elevators, and parking area. This made the room and building very safe and there was also a 24 hour security man supervising the building. We had free parking and excellent free Wi-fi. A nice balcony for coffee and drinks with a great view of Waikiki was used often. The only drawback is it is a bit loud at times since your right in the center of the action. It's not a high end hotel but if you want an affordable option and a very clean, safe, comfortable room in an amazing location, then this could be your place!","Edmonton, Canada","Dan M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",105,4.0

We booked last minute and on a budget. This was the least expensive rental home we found with a kitchenette and decided to go for it. We had a good experience dealing with the Hawaiian Condo Rental staff and they easily accommodated our late arrival/check in. We liked that parking was included in the rental. The location was fantastic - yes a busy street (mostly pedestrians), but what do you expect in Honolulu/Waikiki! It was about a 10-15 minute walk to the beach and surrounded by shops, restaurants, nightlife etc. I did hear early morning garbage/delivery trucks.We ran the air conditioner at night and blocked out the street noise.The unit itself was definitely not luxurious and could use some renos and serious cleaning! It was a decent size for the two of us and for the amount we were there it was ok. However, one morning my husband dropped something and went to wipe it and the cloth turned black. Obviously the floors had not been cleaned well, if at all. He saw one cockroach. (And there was signage while we were there indicating that pest control was there on a certain day if required) The bed was old, but comfortable enough. The balcony was small and our view was not great. We had a table and chairs, but no other seating. The closet was full of stuff so we only hung a couple of sweaters. The unit had basic TV but no internet. Also had towels, and very basic dishes. Bring your own shampoo etc.The lobby of the condo/hotel has been renovated very nicely. We didn't use, or look at the pool. The need for keyfob to use the elevators made me feel this was a secure building. I probably wouldn't choose this unit/location again renting from Hawaii Condo Rentals, however I'm not turned off of Marine Surf or Hawaii Condo Rentals.

We stayed in #1602 and its an extremely old building that use to be a hotel so the rooms are tiny. It looked great online...the pictures were very well done but after you're in the room with old fashion low ceilings you feel trapped. We could have accepted the room size if it were not for all the ROACHES crawling everywhere..kitchen..bathroom..living in the bottom of the coffee pot!!!! So gross and disgusting. After making coffee and pouring it for my new husband, there was a baby roach floating on top! This is definitely a health issue as well. The bed was horribly uncomfortable and there were stains on the sheets! There was not enough room for luggage...tiny closet. The balcony railing was not to code...the rails were more than 4 inches apart making this very dangerous if anyone had small children. The website also said partial ocean view...joke! You could barely see a sliver at a great distance. The noise levels in the condo with all the traffic, buses and the air conditioning unit were very annoying! I would NOT recommend this condo.

All the condos in the building are privately owned, so the furnishings, etc will vary from unit to unit. We found ours on VRBO.com through Tom at Waikiki Place. I highly recommend renting through Tom - he has 3 units in the building. He was pleasant and easy to deal with. He has done a nice job remodeling the unit we stayed in (and I believe from looking at the website, all the units are very similiar). Ours had a Palm Tree theme - so it was nicely decorated with palms and palm tree pictures and decorations. The unit is a studio and a tab small, but great for 2 persons. There is a nice balcony that had a table and two chairs - with a peek a boo view of the ocean and great city views - especially at night when everything was all lit up. There is a queen bed, that while not the most comfortable - it was fine and my back wasn't bothered by it at all.There is a nice sofa (sleeper I believe) with decorative pillows and coffee table, flat screen tv mounted on the wall, lots of storage place - a double dresser near the bed and another dresser and closet near the bathroom. There is an ipod docking station and stereo which was great! The kitchen has a fridge, oven and stop top, microwave, granite counter tops, had enough plates, dishes, wine glasses, coffee cups for 4 persons, plus toaster, coffee maker, blender, pots and pans. It was great for the little cooking we did - we love have breakfast in the condo or pre-dinner pupus and having a nice fridge to store everything is wonderful. There is also a small round glass top table and 2 chairs in the condo for dining.The bathroom has a shower/tub combo with a rainhead shower head, great water pressure, tile around the shower and on the floor, really nice and newly renovated. Nice towels and linens were provided.Parking spot was included - what a nice change from the expensive hotel parking! There is also free wifi. No washer dryer in the unit - but there is one on top floor. We were on the 17th floor - looking towards Royal Hawaiian Ave - it is also an end unit. Never had a problem with noise. WE did run the fan at night, but never had any problems sleeping or noise from the street. During the day, you have to remember Waikiki is a large city - so expect to hear some noise from the vehicles below - trucks, etc. Never a problem for us.Location - is GREAT! Right on Seaside Ave and Kuhio Street. Easy walk to everywhere and really right in the middle of everything. You walk any which way and there are restaurants, bars and shopping. Nice!!!Pool - this part was just OK. It is on the 4th floor - size was OK. But we didn't see any spa nor any BBQs - which would have been a nice plus. However, you are very very close to the beach and the condo did have beach towels, a cooler, chairs and umbrella - everything you needed for a day at the beach. Safety - we never felt unsafe. You enter with a key fob and use it in the elevator to get to your floor. I would think a safe in the unit would be a nice addition - but we didn't have any problems. No real big negatives that I can think of about this place - the realy negative is that we had to leave it!

However the building is extremely clean and well maintained. There is a modicum of security however entry is via a huge sliding glass door opened via electronic key. When the door opens as someone enters or leaves, there's enough time and capacity for a busload of other folks to enter the building. Nevertheless, I didn't experience any security issues there. Even on the 12th floor, however, the building is NOISY. The gay bars aren't the issue; it's the straight clubs catering to a rough crowd that result in lots of folks shouting their heads off late into the night. Once things finallly quiet down around 4AM, there's an hour or so of peace until the trash trucks arrive and empty the dumpsters at the nearby bars and restaurants. When these trucks back up, the beep beep signal is so loud you could easily mistake it for your alarm clock, even on a high floor with the window shut and A/C on!

They use bait and switch tactics when it comes to actual room location and withheld a part of my damage deposit to clean a stain that was there when i arrived. That having been said, for the price i paid, the room was perfectly adequate. The location of the property is ideal for everything and every room comes with parking, which can make a huge difference. Room internet access was provided for a very nominal charge.

It takes valuable time away from your holiday when you have to spend time on the phone making arrangements and then sitting around waiting for them to arrive.I was informed when booking that this was a 'recently renovated' unit and it was anything but with cracked tiles, damaged floors and bedding that did not fit the mattress properly. I understand that there are some fairly decent units in the Marine Surf but I wouldn't book with Hawaiian Condo Resorts again as you cannot trust what they tell you when you can't check things out beforehand.The best thing about the place is its proximity to just about everywhere in Waikiki you'd want to go.

Things I would suggest you take along if renting a private unit is a paring knife, dish and hand soap, dishcloth and teatowel, salt/pepper, cling film/tin foil, laundry soap/dryer sheets and toilet paper and it's expensive here. I guess it depends on the length of your stay.

The location was great, in the middle of Waikiki, just up Seaside Avenue from the Royal Hawaiian shopping center. Beach access was convenient, just east of the Royal Hawaiian and the Cheesecake Factory.

I have stayed here a couple of times and have never been disappointed. The finish of your room will depend on from whom you rent. The quietest rooms will be “Ewa” on a higher floor. Some units are privately owned rentals, while others are in a “hotel pool.” Basically hotel rooms with kitchenettes, I actually prefer the privately owned units. Past visitors tend to leave conveniences such as suntan lotions, salt/pepper, sodas, etc. In turn, I also leave my “leftovers” for the next guest.The building is not a high-service hotel (who needs it). It is not on the beach (5 min walk). It is not glamorous or particularly romantic (nor is Waikiki for that matter). And it can be quite noisy outside (Waikiki is urban). But! if you want an affordable, clean, safe place to stay, I find this building to be a good value. Most recently I paid $80/nt for a last minute booking with direct negotiating. Go to ---.com for pictures/info, then search the net for better rates. As always; I travel to Waikiki several times a year, I can advise that Waikiki is a nice tropical urban adventure. The city comes with the negatives of a big city, along with the overwhelming benefits of a beautiful beachfront resort. Generally, everything in Waikiki is “a little tired” although there have been continuous improvements in the last few years. If you are traveling solo, take Roberts Hawaii from the airport for $10 (no rsvr rqd). Two or more people, take a taxi from the airport to the hotel (should be under $30). In Waikiki, nearly everything is walking distance or a short shuttle/bus away. If you need a car for the day, you can rent one in Waikiki.","Seattle, Washington","mjgriffy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",101,4.0

If you have travelled to Waikiki in the past few years you will know that staying in Waikiki is a very expensive proposition. While all the fluff of a Sheraton or Hilton can be nice - really, how much time do you spend in the room, in Hawaii? I would hope not too much!! As a traveller who has been to Oahu 8 times, I assure you this is a great value and has all that you need. As for the lack of desk clerk beyond 7PM that so many seem to mention, they are just next door and will come at the drop of a hat (or call) - hotel management run several hotels/condo complexes in Waikiki - and besides the savings can be passed along to the cusomer! Save your money...spend it where it counts....and remember rooms in the tropics will not be the same as back home - very humid - these rooms are kept very clean.

While it's not on the beach, it is centrally located in Waikiki which makes everything you do just a short walk away. The rooms are large and you have great mountain views from the lani on the higher floors. My complaints are that the beds are on the small size as is the pool (but who cares with all that beach for sunning and sleeping). One thing to keep in mind is that there is so much entertainment to engage you that you spend little time in your room. Save your money for the fun things Ohau has to offer and book your room here.

We arrived at around 9:00pm, and the front desk was closed, with no staff around whatsoever. It took us a while to check in.Once we got up to the room, we were shocked to find that it wasn't quite the 'spacious studio loft' that they had advertised it as. In fact, it was quite the contrary. With just two double beds, a table, two chairs, and a dresser (and the ""ensuite kitchen"" - which was actually just a counter with a sink, a fridge, and a stove), it was cramped and barely big enough to fit all four of us and all of our luggage. We also discovered that the dresser, which stood about 2 1/2 feet tall, only had 2 drawers. That meant that two of us had to live out of our suitcases for the 2 weeks we were there. Not a good start to our 'family vacation'.I have to mention - you need a key to operate the elevators, which we didn't know when we got there because nobody at the front desk expained this to us. Also, only one of the two elevators was in full working service. That made things quite aggravating, especially if there were a lot of people waiting. It also didn't help that it was a particularly slow elevator.The pool was salt water - yes, SALT WATER! What kind of hotel uses salt water in their swimming pool? Needless to say, the kids weren't too thrilled about that. Also, the pool was no more than 6 x 12 feet, which has to be one of THE smallest pools we've ever seen. It was pathetic. Plus, the positioning of the pool meant that it only got maximum 5 hours of sunlight a day, because it disappeared behind the adjourning buildings at 2:30 everyday.A couple times during our stay, the second elevator broke down, leaving us with no choice but to take the stairs - TO THE 21st FLOOR. We were less than pleased.Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a quality vacation. Although the staff was friendly, the beds were comfy, and the rooms were clean, we expected much better. Don't let the ads fool you, it isn't all that it's made out to be.","Guelph, Canada","KobayashiVacationers</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Guelph, Canada</strong>",31,2.0

It was our 25th anniversary so this was a special trip and had a great time, both in Waikiki and crusing the rest of the Islands. Hawaii is very beautiful, but a bit expesive for the Canadian dollar!! Location of the hotel was perfect to everything, bus, excursions (which can be booked in the lobby) malls, shops, resturants/bars, Internet Cafe, a bit of a walk to the ocean, but a plesant walk and you can cut through the Royal Hawaiian Hotel (can't miss it , it's PINK!! Hotel views were amasing (17th floor) and had 2 balconies, one city and one ocean view. Flaws: 1. Front desk was closed after 7 p.m. and we arrived at 10 p.m. Security had to call the manager and after a very long flight and a very hot (and humid) night wasn't a great start to our vacation. 2. Had to call for a hairdryer and it was taken away when the maid came in next morning. 3. No microwave, which made cooking in the room more awkward as we had to buy food that had to be either cooked on the stove or oven and despite air-conditioning made the room slighly warm. Groceries are also more expensive and not being able to buy microwave foods made it even more expensive. Ate ""in"" 2 nights and eating out is the same as in. depending on your taste. We found out upon check-out we could have rented a microwave for $10. (US), but we had been told there would be one in the room?????????? 4. No resturant in hotel other than an Italian resturant off the lobby, but very expensive. Since it was our anniversary trip, we went and despite the cost (again for us Canadians, was double) the place, the service and the food was excellent!! In all, the hotel was good and knowing the ""flaws"" would stay there again. Final note....It's a bit out-dated in decor and bathrooms need some work and have someone on the desk at night, as not all flights arrive before 7p.m.!!","St. Albert, Alberta Canada","Culture36750</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Albert, Alberta Canada</strong>",20,3.0
