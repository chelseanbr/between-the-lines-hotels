The prices in Waikiki are ridiculous pretty much across the board, but in my research this hotel had the best price for the simple accommodations we needed. It is a small hotel, very simple, no breakfast, no 24 hr lobby, no pool, no closet, & no daily housekeeping. (Not listing cons, just information) I do not like daily housekeeping personally, since I always sanitize our hotel rooms upon entry & prefer things be left alone until needed. Our particular room did have 2 beds, good A/C, thick drapes over large patio window, small balcony with chairs & side table, tv, a room cellphone instead of a land line, microwave, mini fridge, sink with little dish soap bottle & countertop, coffee maker & 1 pack of coffee, silverware & basic plate ware, safe, little table with little stools, a clothes hanging rack next to dresser, shampoo & conditioner, and entry to the elevator is by key card. The small elevator opens directly into the open sidewalk next to the street & office door. The front desk has some grass mats & beach towels you can borrow to take to the beach which was handy. The only negative things about our stay were that both of our beds had a little issue with the sheets that was fixed quickly upon calling the front desk for new ones. There was a bad odor that was pretty much always around the front of the hotel, didn’t smell it inside or anywhere else. And there are small windows next to the front room door that are frosted for privacy, but have nothing to block the very bright sunlight coming through shining directly onto our pillows that didn’t help us get our much needed rest. Our stay was pretty positive overall. Other than the sheet issue that was taken care of, the room was one of the cleanest I’ve encountered in a good while, even the carpet looked to be in great shape. The location was not scenic, but an easy walk to the beach & main thoroughfare for shops & restaurants. The Waikiki area is swarming with LOTS of noisy tourists & foot traffic, but since this hotel is just a short distance from this the tourist noise was very minimal thankfully. There is some traffic noise, so I recommend ear plugs or a noise maker app like we used. I would recommend this hotel!!

We were right near the beach; there was parking for a fee. There we were, just 2 blocks from the ocean front where the wealthy do their shopping.

The rooms are small but well laid out and quite functional. Overall reminds me of a European hotel room. The price is good. Overall this is a bargain. So what was the problem?There is no 24 hour lobby and apparently the manager is not always available. This can be a big problem.We had an issue with our key card just after 8pm on a Saturday night and could not get into the building or our room. There is an intercom for the Resident Manager so we tried that. No answer. There was a telephone number for the Resident Managers phone we picked up from the intercom message - tried that. No answer. We tried texting. No answer. Some guests gave us access to the building when we explained. We went to the Resident Managers apartment and knocked. No answer.By this time we had been working the problem for 40 minutes without result so we called AirBnB that we had booked with. Forty-five minutes on the phone with them and no result. We wound up sitting on the cement walkway outside our room while we tried to work out what to do next. The 'resident manager' arrived right about 10, so two hours into the adventure. He got our key-card squared away but seemed really put out. ""Look,"" he said, ""I am not the Resident Manager, I am just a guy who works here. I am tired and I really don't want to talk about it.""So either they do not have a ""Resident Manager"" even though all the postings in the Hotel say so, or the have a ""Resident Manager"" who doesn't want to be one and will be unavailable when it is inconvenient for him. Either situation is troublesome.So, in the balance, great location, small quiet rooms, good price but if there are problems after hours. . . you may be on your own.You decide","Hilo, Hawaii","jm2hilo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hilo, Hawaii</strong>",72,2.0

The room itself was surprisingly nice-spacious, clean, and with new looking amenities. Clean bedding, towels, and the usual soap, shampoo, conditioner samples. A balcony offered marginal views of the city, not beachside as I'd been hoping, but for a total price of 132.00 for one night, one can't beat it.The front desk clerk was really friendly and warm. She greeted us with a big smile and was really well-informed. We arrived very early after disembarking from cruise so the hotel accommodated us and allowed us to store our bags until the 3pm check in time, which was really a relief. The location around WCH is a little bit dicey. At one point I looked down off the balcony and saw a small pile of garbage across the street that featured, of all things, an ironing board. My first thought was, did someone try to use that for surfing? Very strange. There was a cute restaurant adjacent to the hotel that seemed pretty lively but from 5 floors above you couldn't really hear a sound. Overall, a clean and very nice hotel to end our stay in HI. My only problems with WCH were the fact that the front desk closes promptly at 8pm and reopens at 8am. Any problems in between are dealt with by an onsite manager. By day 10, if you're anything like me, you'd probably be ""peopled out"" by then. Dealing with one more person for things like ice, change, directions, etc seemed exhausting.The other problem was the security, or lack thereof. A single female would probably feel a little bit unsafe here, as the hotel's elevator is street level and accessible only with your room key. Once you swipe your key you can enter the elevator to your floor. Sixth floor is only reachable via stairs, though. In any case, I was nervous about getting into the elevator alone. It would have been fairly easy to swipe your card key and let someone on with you, and into the hotel itself, who was not a guest. There is an onsite laundry (washer/dryer). I recommend getting change in advance of 8pm if you don't want to go home with suitcases packed with funky clothes, like us. Meh.Internet access was very touch and go. I'd say I was able to secure WIFI on the iPad for about 30 minutes total and virtually not at all on the phone. There were no clear exit/emergency signs or instructions posted where they would usually be located (behind the room door). Other than these issues, I'd recommend this hotel if you are looking for accommodations that are reasonably priced, clean, comfortable, and within walking distance of area beaches, restaurants, shops, etc. Just be aware of your surroundings and you should be fine. And bring quarters!Cheers.","Fanwood, New Jersey","maribel v</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fanwood, New Jersey</strong>",21,4.0
