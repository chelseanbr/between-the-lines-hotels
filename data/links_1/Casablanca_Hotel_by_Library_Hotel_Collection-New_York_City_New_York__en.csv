Excellent staff, clean, nicely appointed room/bathroom, comfortable bed, and Rick's Cafe, which had snacks and refreshments available at all times. We stayed in a Premium King and while not a huge room (but large by NYC standards), it was very comfortable for the two of us. We were on the fifth floor just down the hall and around the corner from the elevator and it was very quiet. There was ample closet space, a bistro table and chairs, large, comfortable bed, and the bathroom was bigger than I expected with a full tub/shower combo with pretty tiling. There was even a lighted makeup mirror in the room, which I greatly appreciated, since most hotel bathrooms have terrible lighting for applying makeup. The channel selection on the tv wasn't extensive, but we weren't in the city to watch tv, so that didn't matter much to us. Rick's Cafe was a treat--a very nice, comfortable space to hang out at any time of day, The staff, particularly Jeffrey, were all very friendly, kind and helpful. One minor inconvenience was that the room didn't have an adjustable thermostat. The room was overly warm when we arrived, and although a staff member adjusted the valve on the radiator, it didn't help much and we had to leave the bathroom window open to cool the room down. Otherwise, the accommodation was perfect in just about every way.

It is kind of old-fashioned, in a nice way. The staff goes above and beyond to make you feel at home. Every person who works there is so nice and helpful and pleasant.The room was nice. A little small, maybe. But the furnishings were lovely, especially the spacious tiled bathroom. The room was also surprisingly quiet, especially given the location of the hotel. The breakfast was great. The food was really good and there were a lot of choices. Away the room is set up, you end up talking to other guests (if you want to) and that is really fun. In the dining room, the staff was extremely helpful. For example, they went out back to find me a plain yogurt and then to heat up my oatmeal and bring it to me even though I think technically I was supposed to do it myself. They were just really nice.I had a little issue with the New York Sports Club —access to it is one of the amenities that you get for your $25 resort fee —and I thought I should let other guests know about it. And overly aggressive member, who was sharing the lane with me, kicked my foot so hard that he literally broke my toe. I had to go the clinic and an X -ray confirmed this. Although I told the manager, Michele, in a phone conversation and a letter and sent her pictures, she never returned my phone calls nor indicated that she had addressed the situation. So I’m writing this in order to warn other people to be careful if they go to the health club. I do not think it is well-managed. And how it is managed stands in such stark contrast to the graciousness of the hotel that it is shocking. I do recommend that people stay at this lovely hotel.

Unlike large chain hotels, this hotel chain is friendly and personable with the staff wanting to share places to see, visit and some tricks of the city. The hotel room we had was spacious and contained all that you would need on a 3/4 day city break.The 5pm-7pm cheese and wine evening time was very welcome, after a day of walking the city, allowing you to relax and chill. The breakfast did not have a cooked option, but there was enough choice for many diets. The location was very good, just off Time Square. After reading a few reviews on Trip Advisor, we plugged for this hotel. But I would re-emphasise that you are staying in a city, with all the noises that a major city creates, police sirens, fire engines and honking of horns, even at 3am in the morning! The double glazed windows can only shut out so much noise! This is not a criticism, just something to be aware of when booking the hotel. The trade off is being able to walk pretty much everywhere in Mid-Town New York City! Being a special birthday for one of the party, the hotel provided a complimentary bottle of wine in the room, which was a lovely treat.

Bed was comfortable & Room was clean - but, it was located right on the street side of the hotel (43rd St.) - first 2 nights had quite a bit of noise (trucks & traffic from the street) but, we shrugged our shoulders and chalked this up to staying in the ""City that Never Sleeps"" - the 3rd night, however, they were doing some type of street (or sidewalk) construction and there was a jack-hammer pounding & pounding & pounding until right around 2:00AM - theyre must not be any insulation in the walls because it sounded like the guy with the jack-hammer was standing right next to the bed. Getting ANY sleep at all was, quite honestly, an impossibility. I spoke to a Manager in the morning after getting approx 4 to 4-1/2 hrs of rest and expressed my disappointment. He told me that he ""had no control"" over what the city had going-on outside in the way of construction, etc. I told him that I certainly DID understand this. However, when I booked this stay and pre-paid at the rate of a 5-star Hotel, I expected that (at a minimum) I would be able to get a decent night's sleep. I suggested that they should either ""Comp"" the 3rd night or at least discount it by 50% because it is ridiculous to have a jack-hammer going until 2AM right outside the bedroom window. He told me that he checked with the GM and they (in so many words) were ""sorry"" but simply ""unwilling"" to do anything to alleviate the problem. This is NOT a large Hotel - the location is quite good - BUT at least 1/3 (maybe even 1/2) of the rooms are right on the 43rd Street side of the building and they do NOT appear to have taken any steps to try to Quiet the Noise - if you want to a Hotel where you can get a decent night's sleep.

Tony’s restaurant is adjacent to the hotel, accessible by a door from reception, a great authentic New York restaurant and bar, the food and atmosphere was just incredible, you really need to try it at least once, you do need to book well in advance.

The best is the italian coffee maker, as the American coffee is not my taste. Every afternoon they offer wine and cheese reception with crakers, fruits, cheese, wine and prosecco.

But it was a truly terrible experience and since then we've tried hard to solve the mystery of why there are so many great reviews of the place. The hotel is old, the lift rickety, the rooms tired, and the window attached air conditioning phenomenally loud. None of this is uncommon, I know, with the old generation of NY hotels - though not the new generation of NY hotels, many of which are near to this one. But what makes this experience unforgettable - in a bad way - is that they are still renting out rooms on the front of the hotel very close to construction work that carries on through the night. A good night's sleep just wasn't possible - at least for us. And the trouble with the rooms at the back is that they overlook a dark, dank and narrow inner courtyard. The only explanation we could come up with for the positive reviews is that the average age of the clientele while we were there must have been over 50, maybe over 60, and many in this age range clearly appreciate the friendliness of the staff and the convivial atmosphere of 'Rick's Bar' with the wine and cheese evenings. Unlike many NY hotels you don't feel anonymous here, and for many in this age group I guess that's important. But on it's own physical terms it's impossible to recommend this hotel. At least until it's refurbished and the construction stops. When we raised the problems with the hotel they did their best to deal with them and to try and make us happier, but ultimately they can't fix the fundamental issues - the construction noise and the tired nature of the hotel.",,travellingglobalman,3,1.0

The location is great right by Times Square but this is also a bit of a drawback as the road outside is nearly always clogged with traffic making getting to and from a bit difficult. It is also a narrow road so the front facing rooms are a bit gloomy due to being dwarfed by the surrounding buildings. The room itself, we had a mini suite, was spacious and comfortable. I noted previous review concerns about the construction work but that only affected us for the first night. There is also a white noise machine which worked well to drown out the traffic noise. The included continentaly breakfast was good by US standards and the three hour wine and cheese + in the evening also good. The problem for both was that there was just not quite enough table room so it always felt a little crowded. The staff were excellent and went out of their way to anticipate and satisfy our needs.

When we were planning our second trip, we knew there was no place better to stay, so we decided to book here again. This time we were meeting friends in the City, so we suggested they stay here too. The hotel is in a perfect location for getting to all the places you want to go when visiting Manhattan. There are multiple subway stations all within a block of the hotel which makes using public transportation a breeze. Times Square is a spectacle like nothing you’ve ever seen, but the minute you walk in the hotel you’d never know that chaos is a block away. Loved that the Police Station is right at the end of the block—for safety as well as a landmark when navigating back to the hotel from Times Square. Rick’s cafe on the second floor is a comfortable, relaxing atmosphere to recharge your battery after being out all day, or to kick off a day in the city. My only negative comment would be about the construction going on across the street. The construction goes on all night long and is VERY loud—jackhammer, trucks backing up, concrete being thrown into the back of a metal truck, etc.....The first night we were there our room had a window overlooking 43rd Ave, which is where the construction is. The hotel has no control over the construction, but we got no sleep the first night because of the all-night noise. I’ve never experienced anything like it. We went down first thing the next morning and asked to change rooms, which they graciously and apologetically did. The rest of our stay was perfect. While the hotel can’t control the construction, they do know it is going on, and I feel those rooms overlooking 43rd should be discounted. We paid over $400 to be kept up all night our first night in town. There is no comparison of those rooms to an interior room.

On this front, the Casablanca delivers in spades.The staff are really great and make this hotel a hidden oasis: they are so helpful and are genuinely happy to chat with you about what you've done during the day. I got wet through, when I went to Ellis Island, and it felt like I 'popped home' to get changed before having a late lunch.  As many reviewers have said, the breakfast, the cheese and wine and the lounge are all great features and I really appeal/ give a lovely sense of inclusion. I think that NY can be a tough city, if you stay in the wrong place, and I really enjoyed it here.Whilst I have given 5 stars (because it's great and I loved it), I would echo some of the previous comments about some of the décor being a little tired (and bathroom, when I first arrived, did smell a bit of drains - it passed). This is all forgivable as it's an old building, with a certain style, and when you stay here you are not looking for a shiny chrome experience, you are looking (and will find) a very special boutique hotel. Overall it's quiet as a hotel and the beds etc are very comfortable.

Beautifully decorated in Moroccan style and all day tea, coffee, crakes etc. Our room happened to overlook W43rd so as we were there during Labor Day celebrations ( being Brits we hadn’t realised) was rather noisy. We expected a certain level of noise being near Times Square and we travel with ear plugs so we were fine. If you aren’t expecting Times Square noise at night it may be worth asking for a room in a quieter spot in the hotel.The toiletries provided are beautiful and everything is so tastefully presented. All the staff were lovely from toasting bagels for us at breakfast to on our last day organising a car to take us to the airport for a set price including tolls and tips and we could pay by card. We believe it was excellent value as it took 90 minutes to JFK and we suspect a yellow cab would have been more expensive.The lounge is really comfortable. Wine is provided every afternoon from 5pm but if there was a bar available even one you pay for, it would take the place up a notch even more. I am certainly not complaining about the lack of a bar but we like the hotel so much that to be able to get a lunch time beer there rather than go to another bar would be the icing on the cake!As you can see there is nothing to dislike about this hotel in my view; and my comments are really only about personal preferences.If we get back to Manhattan ( which we love) this will always be our “ go to” hotel.","St Austell, United Kingdom","299cathyd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St Austell, United Kingdom</strong>",119,4.0

I'd requested an inner room rather than be at the front of the hotel. Therefore, there wasn't loads of natural light, but this really didn't bother us. The beds and the pillows were really comfortable too. I've actually taken the details of the company that the pillows come from as I want some for home!! Maid service was superb and a little weather report card and chocolates placed on your bed each evening was lovely.Ricks cafe was a haven of a wonderful breakfast each morning and retreat throughout the day and evening.

We’ve been to the Library Hotel — part of the Library Collection — which we very much liked, so decided to try another of the collection, the Casablanca, in part because it received even better reviews. For the life of me, I don’t understand how this could be so.Let me start with the positives: 1. The staff was very nice and responded quickly to my requests for another towel and, in general very responsive to my needs. 2. The bed was comfortable. 3. The bathroom seemed to have been recently renovated and, although small, was very adequate.The negatives, however, left a far greater impression. The “theme” as the name of the hotel suggests was only vaguely apparent — some tiles in the bathroom, in the elevator and in the lobby along with some poor art work of Casa Blanca constituted the full extent of Morocco. The elevator — only one was working — was extremely slow to arrive and was jerky in stopping, leaving me grateful I arrived. The best way for me to describe the room Is “sorry”! It was dark with one small window in the corner that was mostly filled with an air conditioning unit and looked out onto a “courtyard” but reminded my of a tenement building looking into another hotel room. The room, although clean, seemed dark and dingy. Everything was “decorated” in shades of brown. The air conditioner was extremely noisy and, although it cooled the room, it did not take the humidity out. On another note, the continental breakfasts, which were included in the price, were extremely minimal and uninspired.I was extremely disappointed in this hotel. As I previously stated, it received better views than the Library Hotel and was slightly more expensive. I will never go there again.","Boston, Massachusetts","parbez</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",49,2.0

During the happy hour we had the pleasure of meeting some wonderful folks like Margaret who went above and beyond to make you feel like family. She and the other young gals hosting the happy hour and breakfast in the morning take pride in their jobs and it definitely shows in their positive and caring attitudes towards all the guests enjoying this wonderful hotel. Of course, one of the best parts of staying at the Casablanca was the fact that you are only a few steps from Time Square and all the wonderful activities it has to share.

If you want or need to be right in the thick of things in Times Square, yet have a peaceful place to relax and recharge, the boutique Casablanca Hotel is it! My deluxe Queen room was small but not cramped so I recommend the ""deluxe"" designation for any room you get. I had one of the interior rooms with a view facing a wall and windows of other rooms to the side across the way. That was okay since it's not like I spent a lot of time in the room staring out the window. The a/c is noisy but that didn't bother me since I didn't need it that much so I didn't have to blast the TV to hear over it. But if I had to, I could have slept with it on all night b/c I'm not a light sleeper. The bathroom was smallish but I expected that. However, there should be a bar to hold on to as you get in and out of the tub/shower and more ""non-skid"" protection in the bathtub. I wear shower shoes because of foot issues so I was okay and held onto the sink getting in and out. The elevators jerk a little when stopping at different floors but I got used to it since I arrived safely each time!The hotel is expensive for the size of and the quality of decor and amenities but New York (Manhattan in particular) is very expensive in general. If you want Ritz-Carlton style, you will surely pay $1000 or more a night in this town. Plus, at Times Square you're in tourist central of New York City. I'm sure all those businesses have to pay high rent to be there so they have to charge you what they do. I was happy with my room.The nightly wine and cheese in Rick's Cafe was delightful and you can get coffee, little pastries, cookies and fruit from there all day. Didn't get a chance to try the continental breakfast during my stay because my conference workshops at the Marquis Marriott 3 blocks away (too expensive for me!) started early and I would just eat fruit I'd taken from the Cafe the night before. All of the staff were very pleasant and helpful. Times Square was crazy crowded but as soon as you turn the corner onto 43rd Street and walk a few paces to Casablanca's entrance, it was like entering another world. I loved it!

The rooms are bug enough, particularly grid sized bathrooms with effective A/C which was needed! It is quite dated in style but that just adds to the charm of the place!

The location of the hotel is amazing, right on Times Square and walking distance to lots of major attractions and subway. If you are going to New York and would prefer to be somewhere quieter then I would suggest choosing a different location.The room we had was cosy and clean and had excellent facilities that most hotels would not offer as standard. The bed was extremely comfortable. My only criticism about the room would be the air conditioning unit could only be used when the window was open. This did not affect us too much as there is also a ceiling fan which we used so we could not hear the street below by shutting the window. Our towels were replenished twice a day which was a really nice surprise and the lady who cleaned our room for us did an excellent job, the room was always spotless when we returned for the day. On arrival we were given a bottle of red wine and a bottle of prosecco from the hotel as a gift for being newlyweds which was not expected and really thoughtful. We also got two bottles of water in our room everyday. The hotel offer cheese and wine everyday between 5 and 8pm in the lounge area which is free. We only managed to do this one day during our trip due to other plans. The wine was of good quality and it was a really nice spread of different cheeses and biscuits and fresh fruit and olives etc. Everything is great about this hotel but its biggest asset is its staff. We were greeted with a very warm welcome on arrival by Chris who was staffing the front desk. During our visit we met several other members of staff who were also extremely friendly and always made the effort to greet us as we arrived at the hotel and chatted to us about our day. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York, we had a wonderful stay.","Ashford, United Kingdom","tim2485</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ashford, United Kingdom</strong>",3,5.0

Delightful staff will approach and offer you endless refills.Room is turned down each evening and a card with weather forecast for following day is placed in room with a few chocolates - a lovely touch.Upon our (reluctant) return home we received a message from Casablanca Hotel saying, ""Welcome to the family - you are now part of it!""

The Casablanca Hotel seemed to fit the bill and the reviews were fantastic so I booked it!From the minute I walked into the hotel, I was impressed. The staff couldn't have been more gracious and welcoming. In fact, not even 5 minutes after I checked in, there was a knock on my door from the Housekeeping Manager ensuring my room was to my liking and handing me some chocolates as well as a card with the next day's weather. It was a much appreciated little detail! The bellman brought my luggage up shortly after that and it was obvious that he didn't expect a tip (although I did try to give him one). The hotel is one block away from the hustle and bustle of Time Square and the Theater District while still quiet and quaint. The rooms seem to be very sound-proof which I appreciated and they were well appointed.I also loved the cocktail hour with complementary wine, cheese, and fruit which could be enjoyed in your room or in the dining area adjacent to their library. One thing to note - this is an older hotel so the elevators are slow and a little rickety. In addition, the room I stayed in had a window air conditioner which did not do much to take the humidity out of the room but did cool it down considerably. All-in-all, I couldn't have loved this hotel more and just wish my stay could have been longer!",Seattle,"Chellucille</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle</strong>",0,5.0

This was our first time staying at the Casablanca and we both agreed, this is where we will stay for return visits. The entire staff, no matter their position or responsibility, went above and beyond to make sure our stay was enjoyable. When booking the room, we let them know we'd be in town for a birthday celebration and attending a Yankees game. They so graciously had a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and red wine in our room, accompanied by happy birthday wishes! We also requested a mini fridge for our room. It was installed and ready to go upon our arrival. You know how some hotels have bottled water in your room for $5 or more a bottle? Not here. Those were also complimentary and replenished each day, as well as chocolates left in our room each evening. We weren't certain of the best way to get to Yankee stadium - they gave explicit instructions on the use of the subway, which Metro card to purchase, directions to the closest stop and the most direct route to and from the game (it couldn't have been easier). The complimentary Continental breakfast each morning was delicious, including juices, cereal, yogurt, pastries and bagels, fresh fruit and eye-opening coffee (the ""breakfast ladies"" were so gracious and accommodating each morning). Sadly, we were only able to enjoy a quick glass of wine one evening, but all the accoutrements looked so yummy, we'll be sure to make time for this next visit. After reading other reviews, we were a bit leery of using the parking garage next door, but again, there were no issues and the hotel staff made sure we received the discount for hotel guests. A special shout out to Victor (best doorman ever) - he made sure we had everything we needed, no request was too big or too small and his quick bite recommendations were spot on.","Winchester, Virginia","Becky P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winchester, Virginia</strong>",21,5.0

He also allowed us to select from a variety of services, such as arranged transportation, refrigerator in the room, foam toppers and foam pillows for the bed, makeup mirror and so much more! He knew that I wanted this to be a special trip....and when we opened the door to our suite, a bottle of wine and glasses treated us. After we had unloaded our luggage, we went back to the desk and throughout our entire trip, had excellent assistance from Johan at the desk. He helped us set up the Big Bus Tour, made recommendations on where to eat, showed us maps of how to get there and more. He was truly exceptional as well! It was a delight to see him at the front desk each of the five nights that we were there. We took advantage of the morning breakfast, which was light, but everything was neatly arranged and served with such kindness. We even used this second floor dining area to bring back food and sat at the tables available to have a nice lunch. And our room, we had booked a suite room, which was nice to have the extra size. We had one room with two double beds, another room like a living room and then the bathroom. Was perfect to meet our needs.

A few minutes later we got a call from Asim the front desk manager who apologised and said he would move us to a superior room for 4nights and we would move to another room the last night even though the hotel was fully booked. This room was much bigger and brighter, he also sent up a bottle of wine and champagne to celebrate our anniversary which was a lovely touch. On our second day Asim met us as we came into the reception area and introduced us to John the hotel manager who asked us if everything was okay and said he would send up an ice cream cake which was beautiful On our last day we changed rooms which was a few doors away and they only difference was it didn't have a street view We had a great time in New York in the Casablanca hotel and would definitely go back, the hotel is close to Times square and all the attractions Our trip was made special by all the staff from Victor at the door to Ashley and the girls at breakfast to John the manager and especially Asim who made our stay so memorable ",dublin,"golfer081</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>dublin</strong>",23,5.0

The Casablanca is a beautifully stylish hotel with all the charms of the past. The hotel was spotlessly clean from the small reception area up to the comfortable and relaxing rooms.The guys on the front desk were exceptionally friendly and helpful as was the doorman. Ricks Cafe on the second floor was conveniently positioned with a continental style breakfast available every morning, coffee tea and snacks throughout the day and wine cheese and snacks available in the evening, all complimentary.The room on the 5th floor overlooking 93rd Street was spacious and clean with a good sized bathroom. Ironing facilities and a decent hair dryer which my wife tells me is essential on any trip, are available along with daily complimentary bottles of water and a safe deposit box.The thing I like about this hotel was its proximity to the busy Times Square being only 50 yards away but turn into 93rd street and the hustle and bustle just disappears.To eat - Tony’s right next door is a busy reasonable priced Italian and HB Burgers just up the street is also reasonably priced by New York standards.It was a bit noisy at night hence a 4 and not a 5 star review. This was due not to the hoards of people on Times Square but to the NYPD vehicles parked outside the hotel on 93rd.

We had high expectations due to the reviews and it didn’t disappoint. For us, it had the ideal location - right next to the madness of Times Square and within minutes of a subway station. Maybe the hotel was quite low on numbers when we were there as we only ever came across a handful of other guests throughout our stay. We are early risers and the 7am start to breakfast suited us very well and we had no trouble with finding a table. We popped back to the hotel a few times on our days out and it was quite handy to pop into Rick’s to get a tea/coffee. The ladies serving in there were always friendly and we found the Continental breakfast varied enough for us, with the staff offering to toast bagels or bread, if required.The hotel is a bit dark and dingy in places and our room on the 6th floor was particularly so - with no natural light as such. However, the hotel was amazingly quiet, particularly considering it’s proximity to Times Square and as a light sleeper, I was grateful for this. Also, there was very little noise from doors closing and guests walking up and down the corridors.We took advantage of the DVD library and although the majority of the films were fairly old, we chose three classics (in our opinion) set in New York. The doormen were always courteous and were very helpful when it came to storing our bags on our final day. The hotel even allows you to use Rick’s after you have checked out.To us, this hotel has a family-run feel to it and we would have no problem in recommending this as a place to stay.","Huntingdon, United Kingdom","TheTravellingWilsons</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Huntingdon, United Kingdom</strong>",55,4.0

We arrived at 6 am from a red eye flight. Ground level entry is a small room with front desk, and the attendant said he would expedite turnover of our room for check-in. We were directed to the 2nd floor to hang out in the lounge (Rick's Cafe) which is open 24/7. The lounge is moderately comfortable with water, coffee, cookies available at all times. Continental breakfast (pastries, bagels, cereal, fruit) started at 7 am. We continued to wait for our room hopefully; the staff was very attentive, and twice during the morning went down to the front desk to check on our room. At 2 pm our room still wasn't ready, and we gave up and headed out so as not to waste the whole day; this was the only disappointment of our stay, hard to believe housekeeping could not have our room ready sooner (to be fair, check-in is at 3, but given checkout is noon...). The hotel is literally steps from Times Square, perfect Midtown location. And Tony's di Napoli, which we always enjoy, is adjacent. After finally checking in late afternoon, our luggage was brought up promptly. We had a premium king room, which was fairly large (even by NY standards). The room faced a small interior space, so there was no view, but also no noise; due to the proximity of other rooms across, we kept the shade closed; as there is only one window, and with the interior room location, there was not much sunlight, so some may not like the dark atmosphere of the room. A dorm-style fridge was very convenient; complimentary bottled water was replenished every day. The small bathroom did not feel cramped. The shower head was nice, and there was instant hot water.

Unfortunately, my wonderful review did not go unnoticed, and others like it so much that they have raised their prices. Still worth it though. My wife asked during our stay, why is this a four star hotel? It's not been recently renovated, and the rooms aren't that special? My answer was that although it's not all new and shiny, everything worked, the beds were good, nothing is ""worn out"" but it's really the service. From the door men to the concierge to the housekeeping and the young ladies that serve continental breakfast and pour the wine in the afternoon, everyone is nice, professional and extremely helpful. A five star hotel would be all that and maybe a bit more up-to-date, but you'll also pay twice the price.On top of that, you are literally steps away from Times Square and a block or two from Hell's Kitchen. The rooms are quiet - I never heard any neighbors, and they have improved the A/C since last time so that they don't make a racket. If I had to pick something to complain about, I'd mention the very small, very slow and probably very old elevators. Our first trip there was in a standard room, which is typically NYC small and cramped. This time I splurged on a suite, and it (for me) was worth the extra money. The bathroom was either extremely well maintained or recently redone. The furniture, although not new, is all in excellent condition. The beds were neither extremely firm nor soft, but we both slept very well.

You know those little niggling things that occur in hotels such as a lack of organisation or cleanliness or thoughtfulness? Well, relax when you enter this haven of hospitality. The team are one step ahead of you. They have anticipated your needs and are there to serve. With sincerity and smiles.Whoever owns this hotel must have a policy of hiring only kind people and wanting the guests to be happy, I don’t think I have ever felt this way with any other hotel. I love it here and am so grateful for their business acumen. It doesn’t feel like money is the most important thing; guests are. We know there are three other hotels owned by the same company and we are curious to try them. Undoubtedly they are excellent as well but the Casablanca instils such loyalty in us that it is hard to book even at another Library Hotel. (But next time we might try. Maybe).","Ottawa, Canada","Elle226</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",4,5.0

The only time we used Lyft was to the Met Museum and to the Manhattan Cruise Port.The staff at the hotel were just as good as others had said in their reviews. They made us feel comfortable and valued.Our only one small quibble was that the bagels at Rick's Cafe were a bit stale. I made the mistake of not having mine toasted the first morning. Otherwise, there were good choices and the items were tasty. I especially appreciated the fresh fruit.One of the mornings we went next door to the Brooklyn Diner. It was just OK for the money. The other 2 mornings we happily enjoyed breakfast in Rick's Cafe.Our room with king bed overlooked the courtyard and was very quiet.We will gladly stay at Casablanca again if we make another trip to New York.","Salt Lake City, Utah","jedvik</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salt Lake City, Utah</strong>",7,5.0

We used the hotel's outsourced limo service for airport pickup and return. The total cost (including tolls and tips) for both rides was $216. We had used a shuttle service on our previous NYC trips, but a cost comparison showed the shuttle would have cost just under $200, so the difference of less than $20 was well worth the personal and private service. We were delivered to the hotel before 9 a.m. and the staff went out of its way to find us a vacant room so that we could rest after a 10-hour flight. Shortly after entering our room, a maid delivered a welcome back gift of wine -- totally unexpected and appreciated. We noticed the radiator was not working, so I called the front desk and within minutes someone came to adjust it. He told us that if we wanted more heat, they would provide a space heater, which we later requested. Each day, the maid left us two bottles of water, chocolates and a note about tomorrow's weather report. The mattress was very comfortable and we had a choice of pillows. The free breakfast was basic -- breads, cold and hot cereal, pastries, yogurt, juice, coffee, tea, hot chocolate. No waffles or omelets, but we were satisfied with the food and service. This is a small hotel, so the breakfast room was rarely crowded. If the tables were occupied, people were considerate and quickly left after finishing, and the staff quickly cleaned up. The hotel is centrally located within walking distance of Time Square, theaters, shops, eateries, attractions, and a major subway stop. A police station is nearby, and police cars were usually parked within feet of the hotel's entrance, which made the Casablanca one of the safest spots in the neighborhood. Our room was small, but we appreciated the closet had many hangers and a safe. Bathroom towels were clean and in good shape. Water was hot and pressure was excellent. The facility is a quiet oasis in a high energy city, but the best part of the Casablanca is the people. Always friendly, always thoughtful, always looking out for your comfort.

The hotel rooms are neither large nor new, but they are clean and equipped with everything you need to make your stay comfortable.

I love to see how they differ in ambience, style and service. I also like to see the little extras they offer their guests. Some hotels only excel in their service, others only in food or in their quality of room features and little toiletries but the Casblanca Hotel excels in all categories and exceeds your expectations.On a first appearance the hotel is pleasant and you dont expect much more than average hotel service. I was very impressed from the moment I stepped inside. I was greeted immediately by all staff members and by the time I had checked in the concierge had already tagged our luggage with our room number. I loved being greeted by my name as I passed front desk on my way in and out by every staff member. I especially loved that I could ask any staff member a question and they either had the answer or always assisted me in finding an answer but never left me to figure it out on my own or just passed me on to someone else. The hotel has little extra's that give it the ""WOW"" factor. During our stay every morning was a complimentary continental breakfast with a wonderful variety for every guest. The afternoon was filled with a complimentary wine and cheese spread and every evening we had chocolates on our table and the weather report for the next day left in our room. On New Years Eve we had champagne and gifts left for us. It is rare these days to experience good customer service with a smile let alone excellent customer service with the extra mile. So to experience such a high level of service was surprising and very impressive. We stayed here because Casablanca was listed as one of the top hotels with the best view of the ball drop in Times Square. The New Years Eve celebrations did not disappoint either. All guests have an uninterrupted view on the rooftop. The highlight of the evening was watching the hotel staff join in the celebrations with us. They make you feel like family. In fact, as we checked out the hotel manager came to say goodbye and gave us a hug.The Casablanca is efficiently run and very well coordinated. The location is excellent, the food is excellent, the service is excellent, the staff are always happy and work very well together as a team which creates the perfect atmosphere. You really cannot complain about the Casablanca and even if you are a very fussy person they are willing to make you feel as comfortable as they possibly can, all you have to do is ask. I highly, highly recommend the Casablanca Hotel especially for New Years Eve. When I come back to New York I will always stay with the Casablanca.

Everyone, no matter what their job, had a great personality. All were amazingly helpful, friendly and totally professional - and the reception team helped to save my life.When I was taken ill on day one of our five day holiday, their insistence on calling for an ambulance, rather than our intention of getting a cab to the hospital, gained me the valuable few minutes which mattered when my condition suddenly worsened and became life threatening.I was admitted for surgery and a two week stay in hospital. During that time, the hotel management and staff moved heaven and earth to extend our booking so my wife didn’t have the additional worry of where to stay.They were there to support her, lift her spirit and became her friend - doing everything they could to ease the burden, provide the help, and all while showing genuine concern for both her and my welfare. The hotel is a fascinating building and has protected status, so retains many original features from when it was the Hotel Metropole - notorious for its links to ‘The Mob’ and site of an infamous murder! Nothing so dangerous these days as you sit in the Library eating a good choice of breakfast treats - pastries, coffee and biscuits throughout the day - or, in the evening, cheese, biscuits, wine and nibbles perhaps as a pre-theatre treat. All are included in the cost of the stay.Everywhere is clean and the bedrooms are comfortable, with all the facilities expected, including choice of pillows and mattress topper as just two of the extras to make your stay perfect.Located just 1 minute from Times Square, it is surprisingly quiet, yet is the perfect base for all of Manhatten’s tourist sites. There are several restaurants close by - Brooklyn Diner has great burgers, John’s Pizzaria (in a converted church) is interesting and the food good, and the burger and lobster restaurant across from the hotel serves great lobster salads and lobster ‘burgers’.The stars of the show are not on Broadway, however, but are the staff of The Casablanca - each and every one - and I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Words cannot express our gratitude for what they did in the month we were there, and we will always be in their debt.",London,"Tumbaparrot</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",36,5.0

Our King bedroom was perfect - ample space, nicely decorated, nice bathroom, clean, great pillows and best of all, dead quiet. We really couldn't have asked for anything better. I also liked that you were able to open the windows for a little cool air when it got too warm. In addition to our lovely room, Rick's Cafe, where a continental breakfast was available each morning, a wine and cheese reception each evening, and coffee, tea, and snacks were available 24/7, really made the hotel feel more like a home. The front desk staff were always professional, helpful and friendly, housekeeping was also pleasant and did a great job keeping our room clean, and the ladies at breakfast were pleasant and welcoming. My only complaint is one young lady working at the evening reception who seemed annoyed and cold, but she was the one exception to an otherwise very attentive and personable staff, and we didn't let her stop us from enjoying ourselves.

Again, told the temperature was standard. The reservation manager gave me his card and told me to contact him the next time I was in NYC since there was nothing he could do on a pre-pay.

The concierge (we cant recall his name-sorry) actually asked a staff member to assist us. Dimitri was so very helpful, he took our bags through the crowds and guided us to the meeting point, all with a smile on his face. All of the staff are a credit to the hotel. Our suite actually lived up to the expectations of the photographs on the website. The bed was great, room was spacious and housekeeping was first class. The free breakfast was excellent.

Friday night wine and cheese includes a piano player.The 24 hour access to coffee and biscuits and pastries in the beautifully appointed second floor cafe was also a luxurious and sincere touch.

We stayed in a suite which was immaculate and very spacious. Housekeeping did a first class job each day of maintaining the room to a high standard throughout our stay. Upon arrival, the hotel had kindly left a bottle of complimentary wine to mark my birthday which was very thoughtful and much appreciated. Buffet breakfast was plentiful and a good choice of fresh produce each morning. Complimentary tea/coffee and cookies are served throughout the day. Cheese and wine which is served each evening between 5-8pm is fab. What’s not to like about sitting down in beautiful surroundings with a nice glass of wine, a plate of cheese and biscuits whilst listening to the resident pianist. Upon leaving the hotel, turn right, take a few steps and you will find yourself in the hustle and bustle of Times Square.

After reading reviews about this hotel, I booked it far in advance. It was amazing in every way. We arrived to a bottle of wine in our room to celebrate our anniversary. We especially loved the breakfast every morning which more than met our needs. The wine and cheese in the afternoon was also wonderful and we found it tided us over until we had a later dinner. The room was great and came with everything you would need including the toiletries which were lovely. The A/C is very noisy and we didn't use it at night - I think it would have kept us up but there was a ceiling fan in the room which was great to have as a backup. We really felt that this hotel was an oasis. After very full days of tours and exhibits, we looked forward to coming back to a quiet place - and it really was. This hotel is quiet and very clean. We did the City Pass which was a great way to see the city. We also did some Broadway shows - The Lion King, Come from Away and The Play That Goes Wrong - all excellent! But the best part of our hotel stay, were the staff. When we first got to our hotel, we had to get down to Battery Park to pick up some passes and Christian offered to show us how to use the subway since he was on his way to take one himself. We felt quite overwhelmed with the craziness of NYC (which you get used to!) and he was such welcome help! He walked us through buying a metro card (a must if you plan on using the subway/transit and you should - it's cheaper and easier than a cab), what train to take, etc. He was also a great help in giving advice for various different questions we had. So a shout out to Christian but also to Victor, Dmitri and James as well as the breakfast staff who were also super friendly and always knew what we wanted for breakfast!

I have so much praise for the management and staff at the Casablanca I'm hard pressed to put it into such a limited space. For starters, during our 4 day stay, every time we entered the lobby after a full day of the sights and sounds of NYC my wife and I did feel like we'd just come home to the Casablanca's quiet tranquility. My wife and I met two wonderful couples, one from Australia and the other from Bethpage Long Island on an Alaska cruise 2 years ago.The folks from down under took a cruise that ended in NYC so my wife and I went for a mini-reunion with them and our friends from Long Island.From my first contacts with the Casablanca's General Manager, JohnTaboada and the Reservation Manager Brian Castro, our reservation was handled with ease and no request went unfulfilled. From the minute we entered the lobby to check-in, the staff treated us like old friends and I never saw them without a smile or an offer to help make our stay memorable.The complementary breakfast and the evening wine and cheese served in Rick's Cafe were mouth watering and a perfect way to start and end a full NYC day. The staff at Risk's Cafe, Paola, Jafia, Houda, Maria, Arabel, Jernely and Margareth were pleasant and helped to make our entire experience enjoyable. The front desk staff always offered their help with any question or request we presented them. The professionalism and sincere desire to assist us definitely puts the customer first and foremost in the sometimes forgotten concept of customer service, Jeffery, James, Christian and Dimitri, to name a few are all worthy of our admiration and praise for their exemplary service. My wife and I made a lot of new friends at the Casablanca who we hope to see again the next time we visit NYC. If I could give the Casablanca a ten star rating I would. You can't go wrong at this hotel for many reasons. In addition to its location a few steps from Times Square and the closeness to the theater district , the Casablanca management and staff deliver on the promise of making you feel right at home.

Coffee throughout the day if you're in the hotel and then wine and cheese of an evening. Excellent!

The food is continually replenished and there is a wait staff there making sure you have everything you need! It honestly looks like a hole in the wall as you drive up, but it is anything but. There are always numerous staff waiting to hold the door or assist you in any way. It is literally 20 steps from Times Square where the ball drops, and everything is right there outside the hotel door. The rooms were comfortable and immaculate; the house keeping does a turn down service in the evening with chocolates and a personalized weather forecast for the next day. When we checked out after our 4 day stay, we left to go on a Cruise...so, when we got back, we had some time before we had to head to the airport, so we called the hotel and explained that we had checked out 4 days prior and would they be willing to hold our luggage for us---they did not even hesitate to say yes immediately---and we were so appreciative. As soon as we arrived back to drop off our luggage they also invited us to complimentary refreshments again (delicious chocolate croissants!).

Unfortunately, my graduation (from grad school) took place at Lincoln Center, and I knew I needed to be close, particularly as family was staying in the area as well. I found a great single room (Ladyfriend couldn't join, unfortunately) at the Casablanca, and was really pleased with every aspect of my stay. The room was small, but not by European or even NYC standards, given the price (it was notably larger than my first ""dorm"" room in NYC, some 20 years ago...). The breakfast wasn't lavish -- there was no hot food option -- but it hit all the marks otherwise, including having great coffee. I didn't get to spend much time here, except for to sleep, and for breakfast after my morning runs in Central Park. But what really made the stay memorable was the staff; everyone was friendly to a fault, and seemed interested -- in a way that I have very much come to associate with New York -- in actually chatting. The doorman one night was an undergraduate student at the school where I did my Ph.D. One of the desk clerks was from the Philippines, and as I live in Hong Kong, we had a lot to talk about on that score. I bring it up only because I feel that there is a very human element that Casablanca gets right that not many places do, and for that reason alone I recommend it unreservedly.Because I had family staying at another hotel in the area, I was never able to avail myself of the wine and cheese, but I can attest to the fact that the rooms are comfortable and quiet, and the location is great, if you want to be in Times Square. I would happily stay here again.","Baltimore, Maryland","paginesparse</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Baltimore, Maryland</strong>",102,5.0

We reserved direct with hotel a king mini suite. The two kids slept in a double sofa bed in the living area which had sliding wooden doors separating the bedroom. We were allocated room 502 which faced the street. It was a little noisy but didn’t bother us too much as we are early risers. I’d noticed a little speaker that could produce white noise or comforting sounds to distract us from the street noise. The air conditioning was very efficient since outdoor temperatures were over 30oC. There was also a ceiling fan in both areas which we used too. The king bed was so comfortable. As I have back problems I requested a memory foam mattress topper which was amazing. Pillows were delightful. The other requests were already fulfilled on check in. Check in was fast and efficient and we were shown right up to our suite. I had alerted the hotel my youngest daughter has a nut allergy. We found a basket with some Oreos and fig rolls left for her. How thoughtful! Breakfast was from 7am and was a plentiful continental selection. The ladies would toast bagels / bread and make porridge oats for us if requested. They were all so pleasant and efficient!During day, Rick’s cafe on level 2 ( where breakfast is served ) you can also help yourselves to biscuits and hot drinks. At 5pm until 8pm there’s a complimentary cheese and wine there too. We enjoyed a glass of prosecco or two! Kids loved the Apple cider and popcorn and pretzel fish! In the corner of the cafe is a computer and printer which I used to check in and print the boarding passes. Everyday the rooms were cleaned to a high standard. In the evening a small card telling us the next days weather was left along with some lovely chocolates. Location steps away from heart of the action and just round the corner from sun way station. Perfect!On check out day a slightly later check out of 1pm was granted which was much appreciated as our flight was in the evening. We asked on check out if they could help us get a taxi to jfk airport. The lovely young man ( chris? ) was hunting high and low for at least 15 minutes on the street to hail a yellow cab!

I travelled with family celebrating a big birthday for my mum and upon arrival the staff ensured we had a bottle of Prosecco in our room. We had a suite which was lovely, the rooms smell like incense and have a really warm homey feel to them. On the 2nd floor the hotel offers complementary wine and nibbles. After a long day walking round the city it is much appreciated!! I have to admit I expected the wine to taste like pee but it was gorgeous! Thank you Arabell for your excellent service! The staff at the hotel were so friendly and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble for them! We can't thank the staff at the front dest enough for getting us to the airport on time for our flight, they really went above and beyond to help us after our original driver had a crash! Tony's next door is a must!!! Never had italian food quite like it! Wish I could go back tomorrow.

This being our fourth visit to NYC, my wife insisted that we book someplace close to the Lyric Theatre on 43rd Street. A little web exploring found Casablanca Hotel a short walk away from the theatre. The price was a bit higher than what I paid for other hotels in previous visits to the city, but then those trips were not during the peak summer season, so I went ahead and booked four nights. Nevertheless, I was pleased that the hotel provided free breakfast, 24-hour coffee and snacks, and location location location.The Casablanca's helpful website provided a preview of our room, so we knew to expect it would be small, with a single three-drawer dresser, a closet, and a simple bathroom.When SuperShuttle delivered us at 10 a.m., a friendly hotel doorman greeted us and took command of our two carry-on luggage. Check-in was quick and efficient. Unfortunately, no room was available at that time of the morning, but they put our luggage in storage and said they would call when our room was ready. We were invited to go to the second floor for breakfast.My wife and I are not big breakfast eaters, so it was adequate for us. We ate yogurt, fresh fruit and pastries. She drank decaf coffee and I had hot chocolate. Other choices included cereal, hard boiled eggs, and assorted breads and bagels, which the staff offered to toast for us.Our daughter and her boyfriend live in Manhattan, so we met up for brunch. My wife and I then attended two shows that first day: a matinee performance of Frozen and an evening performance of Jersey Boys.After seeing Frozen, we returned to the hotel and learned our room (No. 408) was ready. The room was as expected, but the closet was much larger than anticipated. And it had a good number of hangers! The dresser drawers were large enough for all our clothes! And the in-room safe was large enough to hold the souvenirs we bought later! The window a/c unit was on and set at a comfortable setting. The ceiling fan kept the room from feeling stuffy.The maid service was excellent. Each day the maid left two bottles of water, two pieces of 72% cocoa chocolate, and the weather forecast for the next day. Very helpful and much appreciated. The hotel does provide free wi-fi, but it was slow so after our first attempt, we turned it off and used our cellular data. There are two small elevators, but as the hotel itself is small, the elevators were never crowded. It was also easy for us to use the stairway to get from our fourth-floor room to the second-floor dining room.The bed and pillows were very comfortable, so no complaints there. The towels and free toiletries were very good. The shower had excellent water pressure and hot water. The wash basin was small and the drainage was somewhat slow, but acceptable.On our second morning, our daughter arrived to take us to Brooklyn to meet her friends for lunch. Just as we left our room, my daughter texted for us to come quick because the staff was giving her a hard time. When we got to the lobby, she was seated in the lobby but said nothing further about it. I took the incident as an example of the hotel's security in action, so I appreciated that they challenged my daughter before allowing her to enter.Speaking of security, Times Square is a short walk away. Police security there is amazing. It seemed on every corner we saw tactical officers wearing bulletproof vests and carrying automatic rifles. Better safe than sorry.During our short stay, we attended performances of Camelot and The Boys in the Band, in addition to the two parts of Harry Potter, and went to the Museum of Modern Art. My iPhone showed I walked an average of 5 miles each day, so my wife and I looked forward to getting back to our hotel each evening. We always went to the second floor to relax with decaf coffee (her) and hot chocolate (me) before going to our room for a good night's sleep.On the morning of check-out, we got up at 4 a.m. for final packing. We took the elevator to the second floor and spent about 30 minutes relaxing with decaf coffee and hot chocolate. I also read a free copy of the NY Times and used the hotel's computer and printer to check in for our flight and print boarding passes. We finally went to the lobby at 6 a.m. to check out prior to our SuperShuttle pick up.Looking back, the Casablanca was the perfect place for our short stay. It offered everything we needed in a home away from home. No problems, no worries, so we could enjoy our time in the Big Apple.We would definitely return.","Honolulu, Hawaii","fhsgov66</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",5,5.0

The staff made a reservation for us at Burger and Lobster which is almost across the street from the hotel.

We arrived early around 1.30pm, check in is from 3.00pm, while our room was not ready, we did the check in formalities which includes a credit card hold for incidentals (we have no issue with this as it is common in most hotels). The hotel held our luggage and invited us to wait in the 2nd floor ""Ricks Cafe"" where coffee, tea and pastries are available 24/7.When our room was ready, we had a Premium King room (#501) - good size room to the inner courtyard with a small window over the AC unit and one in the bathroom.The bed was comfortable, room well laid out and bathroom a good size with an over bath shower. Not great was the lack of ventilation in the bathroom which filled with steam pretty quickly when showering, an extract fan would be an advantage although we opened the window and the fresh air seemed to vent the bathroom pretty quickly - may be more of an issue with extreme weather, i.e. cold or hot.In room safe in cupboard and plenty of hanging space. Complimentary in room water bottle each day and chocolate each night were nice touches.Ricks cafe as mentioned has coffee and pastries 24/7 and there is a continental breakfast provided with cereals, pastries, breads and bagels, fruit and preserves all included and wine, cheese and fruit every night from 5 - 8.00pm which again was a great touch. All staff without exception were excellent.Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would stay here again when in NYC. A nice parting touch while we were waiting for our airport transfer was a brief chat with John Taboada (Hotel GM) who also put our bags into the transfer shuttle, thanks for a great stay with you.","Brisbane, Australia","Jim_bris</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",82,5.0

My wife and I had a king size bed in one of their standard rooms and our son’s family had a two room mini-suite. Our room was not large in size, but it did have a good size bathroom with one sink, storage shelving and a great adjustable rain head shower and bathtub. Our son’s mini suite was spacious by New York standards and had two queen size beds in the bedroom and a sitting room with a separate TV in the entry area. Rooms were well appointed and extremely quiet. We were actually glad that their rooms were interior facing, as a blocked out the ever present street noise.The hotel was extremely well located, just adjacent to Times Square and all of the Broadway attractions. The parking lot was just adjacent to the hotel and with the hotel’s ticket validation, it provides a 50% discount rates. Nice parking lot with good access and accessibility.Hotel is small by any standards, but on Thursday personalized level of attention. Small lobby area that is tight and had 2 somewhat dated elevators that according to our granddaughter felt like a trampoline. The rooms, hallways and all areas were immaculate.The highlight of the hotel was the second floor café area that serves a very nice continental breakfast and wine and cheese from 5 to 8 PM every day. It was quiet, a nice size, and always provided enough space for six people in our group to spread out at a table and enjoy some quiet relaxing time with the family. The area was also well staffed. The very personal staff assisted in dealing with any food related issues, cleaned up areas, toasted bagels, made oatmeal, and handled any and all questions. The area was a serene oasis from the hustle bustle of the city.The hotel was close by to the Saint James Theater where we saw “Frozen” We took advantage of the close proximity to a number of Times Square attractions. We collectively thought this was a wonderful location and venue, especially to enjoy some quiet times in the second floor of the hotel as a family in a serene environment we had never experienced in the hotels in and around the Theater District.

Most everyone staying here the few times I have stayed are what I would equate to retirees. I don't know if I would bring my family to this hotel because of that. I saw a lady and her child for breakfast and you could clearly see most the guests getting annoyed while the child was speaking loudly and just being a kid in my opinion.

Thank him and his staff regarding our stay. Excellent stay and staff:- Dear Asim,Front Office ManagerCasablanca HotelJust thought I would write to thank you again regarding our stay in your Casablanca Hotel in NYC.We have stayed a few times in New York in other Hotels, so we know what to expect with this great, but mad city!I would like to personally thank you and your staff for a lovely stay. We had a great stay. We went to some shows. Done some repeat trips as well as new trips around the city.As I told you while at the Hotel, I understand the concept, the boutique style of the Hotel and really liked the Hotel. As you know we had a minor maintenance issue, over a day or so but it was quickly rectified by Carlos the maintenance guy. Who was very professional For your information. This did not affect our stay in any aspect. But that’s the character of your Hotel. It's an old building, in a Location that cant be beat. The room was always clean.You lead professionally. You are approachable, professional, understanding a really friendly guy, you offered us a new room regarding the issue, but we confirmed we were fine and happy with our room. Your staff are a credit to you and John, the General Manager.Even the guy (cant remember his name but originally from Ecuador) who came to fix the coffee machine, prior to the cheese and wine evenings, we had a joke with him. I loved your Hotel, and I would consider the Library Collection again when back in NYC, fully understand the concept, the decor, loved it.But the best part of your Hotel are your staff, they are a credit to you and you have selected/recruited wisely. All the staff we came into contact with, are a credit to you and the Casablanca HotelThey were all professional, always trying to help, to assist and ask if there was anything they could do. Ie staff at reception, breakfast, evening staff, some staff I cant recall their names.But the staff I do recall their names, I would like you to thank for both of us - to Margareth (birthday girl). Margareth was lovely, funny, we also got some of her birthday cake via yourself. But then realised and said to Margareth, she may have wanted to take some pictures of it or take it home instead of sharing a piece With and me and my other half. Ha HaHer quick reply, we are ""special friends"" and we can share her cake!! Lovely lady.Arabella, Kimberley who served cheese and evening drinks ( with Margareth). They were also excellent, friendly, professional and all had a good sense of humour. We had a joke and laugh with them all.Breakfast staff - Maria and two other female staff (one I think was called Miriam, the other lady I don't know her name). Again, all friendly, professional and they got used to what we wanted for breakfast. Maria was very personable.We met Frank in the lift, and we chatted, it was only the next day I realised he was a staff member on the Front Reception! (I thought he was a guest, he was coming on duty that day in the lift). Again, Frank was very pleasant, professional. As well as Dimitri who we came across, but he failed to help me beat the wife on a computer crossword puzzle game! When he was doing his rounds.Carlos, who fixed our maintenance problem. He is a great guy, friendly, professional and due to the leak I had to use the towels to clean up. He stated he would ensure with the cleaners we got fresh new towels and he sorted the leak out/blockage. We bumped into Carlos a few times and had friendly chats.To be honest all the staff we came across were excellent, professional, customer focussed. They showed you and the owners in a good light.I loved our stay, it went too fast. The location, the staff, character of the hotel were excellent. Faultless.But the staff made it for us. Including yourself in that aspect.We are well travelled, like to relax, wear comfy clothes instead of uniforms, suits for work. It's our down time and wear comfy relaxed clothes. Don’t dress to impress Ha Ha.Your Hotel is professional, small boutique hotel, but not full of airs and graces. It is, like a home from home. That appealed to us. Not pompous, stuffy. We liked that and the staff interaction.I would just point out, that the staff would only interact with guests, if guests wanted them to. We wanted them to! I am very observant. They were professional, customer focussed to other guests in the breakfast room/piano bar or around the Hotel. Some guests were a bit ""sharp"" sometimes, a bit rude ie "" No Please or Thank You"" from the guests, but your staff dealt with them admirably as I watched on.It was lovely to meet you.",UK,"Passenger802811</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>UK</strong>",400,5.0

They made our trip and will definitely chose Casablanca hotel the next time I come to NYC.","Sagamore Hills, Ohio","SpaGirlOH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sagamore Hills, Ohio</strong>",3,5.0
