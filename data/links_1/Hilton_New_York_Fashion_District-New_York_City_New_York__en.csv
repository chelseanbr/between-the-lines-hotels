The room was very clean and good size for New York. The location is quite good , 1 mile to Times Square and Maddison Square Garden is just 2 minutes walk. However if you are a Diamond member please avoid this hotel. I think they don’t even know what Diamond member means . No upgrade, no drink vouchers, there is no lounge and you get nothing at all as a Diamond member. Why being a diamond??? Aa their restaurant is closed they gave me breakfast voucher for 12,50 to use in a convenience shop / deli cafe. For 12,50 in new york you get a coffee and a bagel and thats it. Really poor. disappointed as they charge you much more for their breakfast (when the restaurant was open) than 12,50. One evening I called and asked for a dental kit and the girl at reception told me I have to come down to collect it as there is not enough staff. This is really bad when guests are paying a fair amount of money and also I am a diamond member . I will never ever use this hotel again.

These ""city view"" rooms also cost extra to book, and the rooms and hotel itself are rather worn and dated. Rooms are also small and the hotel had relatively few amenities. If all Manhattan hotels were this noisy, I'd give a higher rating, but I've stayed at plenty that, despite the street noise outside, have relatively quiet and comfortable rooms. Apparently the rooms on the backside of the hotel are quieter (and sometimes cheaper), which would have been nice to know when booking, not when checking out.

The plus side of the location was it’s proximity to many popular places including the Flatiron, The Empire State Building and Macy’s which were all around a 10 minute walk. The downside of the location is that there’s not a great deal immediately outside the hotel or on the nearby streets other than fast food outlets.We booked the hotel back in January 2019 as we got a good deal and the hotel website boasted a rooftop bar and on site restaurant. When we checked in we were told the rooftop bar was closed for refurbishment and that the restaurant went out of business 3 months ago. This meant there was nowhere on site to get food or drink which we were very disappointed by. The reception desk gave us a sheet of food options to order in but we didn’t take up this option.The room itself was a decent size but very basic and not what I’d expect from a Hilton. Our view was onto other buildings so we couldn’t see outside properly. There was a bug on the bed and a bug catcher under the radiator which was a bit concerning! However we never saw any other bugs so we chose not to make an issue out of this. The bed itself was comfortable but the duvet didn’t have a proper cover, it was 2 sheets folded round the duvet itself, which became unfolded during the night which was really irritating, and not very pleasant seeing marks on the duvet.The room was made up daily but sometimes quite late in the day. There were a couple of occasions where we returned to our room around 4pm for a rest before going out again and had to wait for the maid to finish the room. We had to ask for additional drinks one day where they hadn’t been replenished and our final day they had run out of bath towels and we only had hand towels. We always tipped the maid as we appreciate the busy job they have and the time pressures, however it was disappointing that we didn’t always have the items in our room that we should have had.The reception team were all very helpful and stored our luggage on our last day when we checked out and arranged us a private cab back to the airport that afternoon.On the whole the location of the hotel was handy, the price we paid was reasonable and the reception staff were courteous, we were just disappointed that the hotel room appeared more of a low budget hotel than we were expecting. We were also unhappy at the lack of food options available at the hotel and felt that because this change had happened since we placed our booking over 10 months previously, we should have been advised prior to our stay either by Expedia or the hotel themselves.We definitely plan to return to New York again in future however we will be paying more for a more upmarket hotel.","Colchester, United Kingdom","EJCGray</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colchester, United Kingdom</strong>",1,3.0

Can I use the cooler?” “No.” I walked away because honestly I hate confrontation, and it felt like this person just wanted to be petty over one thing or another.

You don’t do that in the hotel/hospitality industry. You accept the mistake/challenge and use it as an opportunity to grow and correct the issue and create the outcome for the guest to have a reason to believe why they should be spending money at the property. They gave two vouchers for breakfast and 2k in points and a refresh of the room. Unfortunately, the room was never refreshed the next day and never was offered a different room. Will not be staying at this hotel again.I emailed pictures the Asst Front Desk Manager for follow up. She copied 5 different individuals on the reply.

I had issues throughout my entire stay.The first thing that happened is my room's door could not close all the way and I had to put in a lot of extra work just to close it. I called the front-desk to fix it and to move me to a new room because I did not want to deal with it.When I changed my rooms I could not use the digital key in the Honors App. I tried calling and asking the front-desk for help and they kept saying they were trying but they clearly weren't and did not care one bit especially the front-desk manager who was rude to me when I checked out. That same manager then told me to call the Honors IT Support and when I did they couldn't help me because only employees can call the number and ask for help. They never were able to fix it at any point when I was there. The front-desk person who was useless also never apologized for her garbage actions and was arrogant and kept saying she was the highest up when she clearly wasn't.As for the room, it's quite small. You don't get a couch chair like you do in other hotels. You only get some super tiny ottoman. The bathrooms are pretty good especially the water pressure. But it's overall a tiny room that doesn't have much. You won't like it if you spend a lot of time in your room. It's doable and adequate if you are out all day and night.The sad thing is that this isn't even the worst hotel in NY but nonetheless this is vastly below Hilton average/standards.

I'm hearing from friends that the digital key, while convenient needs some improvement because Hilton has many issues with it. I have used it in the past and it worked fine so this is my first time having a problem. The room was medium sized and good for no more than 2 people I would say. I stayed alone. The bathroom was a decent size. The room was clean overall. The only downside to my room was the refrigerator. It was full of beverages for PURCHASE only. No room for storing food you may bring from outside. Since this hotel is in midtown area there's very few parking options. You can pay for self-park or valet. The parking is NOT cheap. self-parking cost me $40(more for an SUV) and you CANNOT go in/out. Each time you leave you pay the full price again. If you choose valet parking you pay the flat rate $40 plus $10 each time you go in/out. The property is close to public transportation, Uber and cabs are everywhere, or if you like to walk there's some nice things to see close by such as times square(40th/42nd street areas). The staff was very friendly but were limited in granting me a late check-out because they said the hotel was sold out that next day, I was granted and extra half hour but because I utilize the Hilton Honors app I was checked out at the regular check out time.

The food at Rare (house restaurant) is marginal at best. Pay close attention to the times they consider breakfast. Get this in writing. 3. Do not allow them to place you on the 22nd floor.

We live within driving distance but planned on having a few drinks during a show and didn't want to worry about the drive home or missing the last train back. I booked this hotel because there is a year-round roof-top bar and I thought it would be perfect to attend the show and then catch the roof top bar once we arrived back at the hotel. I had never been on a roof-top bar in the city before. It turned out that the roof-top bar was closed, and closes much, much earlier than other bars, like 11pm. When I mentioned to the hotel person that I had booked the hotel because it had a roof top bar and I was surprised it was already closed this early on a Saturday night, she just answered, ""There are lots of other bars."" Great. But I spent $199 so I could be at YOUR bar, lady, not some other bar. There should be a warning that it closes early if they use that bar in their marketing to attract bookings. I could have had a hotel literally across the street from our show but the rooftop bar was the deciding factor for me even though it was 2.5 miles from the show.Because the bar was closed, we looked in the hall for ice. There is no ice in the hall at this hotel. We went down to the counter and asked for ice and they said, ""Sure, no problem!"" but no ice ever showed up. We waited and waited and finally I cracked open a warm beer I had packed with me from home.Checkout is nice and late, 12 noon, so we didn't have to rush getting out. We did end up waiting 40 minutes for the hotel to bring our vehicle. We were supposed to get warned to call ahead for our car, but no warning was given upon check-in. There is no coffee in the lobby and we had already made the Keurig from in the room- one small cup of coffee each with fake creamer. So when they warned us the car would take a while, I said, ""How long, because I'd love to run to the corner and grab a cup of coffee to wait with."" The valet said, ""No need, wait right here, it'll be 5 minutes."" Well, it was 40min and I could have run to that corner coffee shop 10 times. It was annoying.

Having recently traveled to New York and stayed on the lower east side at a Mariott, I decided to change up my hotel (Hilton) and location. Based off reviews, I was confident this would be a good selection. I imagined myself having a drink and snacks on the rooftop bar or grabbing a bite to eat in the swanky burger restaurant, but boy was I was wrong. My flight from California was delayed 5 hours, putting me in New York around 11pm. Needless to say, by the time I got to the hotel, I was exhausted, hungry and excited to shower and get ready for bed. As I got to the hotel, there was no one in sight to help me with my bags, or even to hold the door open. I walked to the check in desk and when I inquired about room service or hotel restaurant, I was told that they were all closed and I would have to go out to get food. It was then that they told me all the water had been shut off as well. The front desk kindly passed me a few bottles of water and said the hotel wouldn't have water until the morning. I then went out into the snow to find food. Unfortunately, all kitchens in the open bars were closed. I went back to the hotel starving, and kindly asked the front desk again about showering. I said I had a horribly long day and wanted to see if there was any way I could shower. The man at the front desk held 2 water bottles over his head and went, ""you can pour these all over you"". You could imagine how frustrating that would be to a customer. I had traveled all day to show up to a hotel that had no food and no water, not to mention a very unapologetic staff. There was no compensation for guests for this inconvenience - not even a batch of complementary coffee. I was very upset about the experience, so much so that I went to pack my things up and leave but I was just too tired. As I went to bed that night, I couldn't help but think, ""I didn't pay a decent amount of money and fly all the way to NYC to camp"".

With the tennis in action, hotel prices in the city were very high. As a first impression, this hotel is fine. Open and compact lobby, and I was welcomed as a Diamond member after a long-haul flight. NYC was especially humid that week so the a/c was welcoming. Up the lift, which took a while to arrive, and I arrived on a high floor to a soulless corridor. Along I went, to a plain door, and entered the bedroom. My first impression was the damp/fusty smell that was faint in the corridor but noticeable in the bedroom. Second was the tiny size of the room - I know it's New York, but even still. Not impressed. Then I saw the bathroom from the 90s, and remembered that the room still smelled bad. On the upside, the wifi was good and the a/c kept pumping the cold air, though it was likely the source of the smell too. Come morning breakfast in the attached restaurant was fine, though some natural light would be nice when adjusting time zone. Location is a subjective thing in the city, this hotel was fine for meetings I had on the West side of Manhattan. All in all I wouldn't stay here again - I'm surprised at the state of the property given the amazing competition in New York.","London, United Kingdom","andreww912</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",79,3.0

We last stayed at this hotel in July of 2013; see our review titled “Good Location for Midtown Sightseeing”. We booked our stay online using the Hilton website; although we are Hilton HHonors members, we did not receive an upgrade upon arrival (not even to a higher floor); however, we were able to check in online the day prior to our stay and choose our room number. The Hilton Fashion District is located in Midtown in the Garment District bordering Chelsea, not far from Madison Square Garden/Penn Station. It provides a convenient location for Times Square sightseeing and access to various subway lines, bars, restaurants, and souvenir shops. A Whole Foods grocery store and the Sunac Market are located within one block of the hotel, in case you need to purchase food, drinks, or forgotten items. The Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) and its museum are a half-block away.The lobby area itself is not large, but still offers a few places for guests to sit and chat. The decor fits the theme of a Fashion District hotel, with spools of thread composing an interesting art piece behind the front desk and mannequins with interesting costumes in the front windows. A tiny concierge/tour desk is located adjacent to the front door, although it is not staffed. RARE Bar and Grill is located at one end of the lobby, where breakfast is served (complimentary for HHonors Gold and Diamond members). The hotel also features the RARE rooftop bar and lounge, where we joined some friends for drinks one evening. At night, one elevator is dedicated to whisking patrons from the lobby to the 23rd floor rooftop. Two additional elevators access guestrooms on the 2nd to 22nd floors. The hotel has valet and self-parking for an additional fee, and the garage is located just a few yards from the hotel entrance. Taxi cabs were plentiful in front of the hotel, and Uber provides an additional transportation option. We had a corner room on the 9th floor, which regrettably did not give us a view of the Empire State Building because of an adjacent building. (On our last visit, our corner room on the 22nd floor had a great view.) The room was average size for New York City (about 300 square feet), with a king-size bed abutted by two nightstands, a desk/dresser/bureau combination, a small ottoman/seat that could be moved around, and a shelving unit that housed the glass-fronted weighted minibar (do not move anything or you will be charged) and coffee-making supplies, and a small closet that contained an electronic safe, iron, and ironing board. The room decor was modern and appealing, and the fashion theme (or sewing theme) carried through on some of the artwork. The bathroom was a decent size, with a combination tub/shower unit and large countertop vanity with a single sink. Complimentary toiletries include soap, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion. Three sets of towels were provided, despite the fact that the room could really only sleep two guests. The hotel does not offer turndown service, nor does it have vending or ice machines; however, you can call down to the front desk to request ice delivery.We enjoyed our second stay at the Hilton Fashion District, and we had fun at the RARE rooftop bar.",Pennsylvania,"fluffnfold</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pennsylvania</strong>",920,4.0

The room was worn with dinged baseboards and pealing wallpaper. The a/c wall unit was noisy, with a musty, mildew odor. The bathroom had Crabtree and Evelyn bath products, an old wall heater at floor level, that got hot when turned on, a definite hazard for small children, especially if they poked their finger into the coils. There were three elevators for the twenty-two floors, however when the rooftop bar opened, one elevator was dedicated to transport guests directly up the entire night, so was out of commission during that long time period, resulting in long wait time for elevator.

First the good:-the staff is very friendly, welcoming, and personable.-the location is excellent although the block on West 26th is a little rough.-bed was comfortable.-shower was a stall…more hygienic than a tub.-window actually opensThe not so good:-as a Diamond member I was told the room assigned me was an upgrade; it was not. In my mind it was a downgrade. Very small, no view, right beside the elevator, noisy…from the up and down of the elevator, plus there was a screeching at times (like metal on metal). Not the way to treat your most loyal customers.-walls are thin; noise from the halls.-condition of the hotel in general is more Hampton than Hilton. -construction of a water tower on the roof of a building across the alley occurred at 8 AM on a Sunday. That made enjoying a leisurely Sunday morning in the hotel room impossible.-no ice machines; refrigerator in the room is one of those contraptions that charge you when you open the door. They will bring up ice but then you get into this tipping game,-noted to front desk my displeasure about the room and the noise from the elevator. The latter was a real nuisance that forced me to run the (loud) heating/AC unit to block out the noise. Asked me what could they do to make it right? Offered to change my room but this was not a solution at that point in my stay. I replied, comp me one night. Final bill…no comp for one night; no response; no feedback. Hollow promise.Rooms in the back of the hotel, some of which may be a little larger, either are adjacent to the elevators or have no view at all except for maybe the top three floors. Rooms in the front are smaller but at least face the street and are more removed from the buildings on the other side.Bottomline, a big disappointment. For the price paid, or a few dollars more, I believe that I could have done much better.

We arrived prior to check in time and had already selected a room on the 21st floor using the HH app. (By the way all double beds city view rooms face south, we were hoping for North facing Empire State Building for our young girls to enjoy. I did find this out when trying to select room for check in on the app). Having arrived before check in time we asked to store our luggage while going to get lunch, and the kind lady checking us in offered a room on the 19th floor that was already available. Our two girls were also greeted with crayons and activity pads by the front desk staff, which after a long day of traveling brought smiles back to their faces. We were thanked for being Hilton silver members and given a bag with waters. We were told about the rooftop bar, which my husband was able to go up one night and enjoy drinks and the views. Kids were not allowed up, but the front desk did say if we came down to the desk early they would take us up with our girls so they could enjoy the view prior to the bar opening. We tried at 4:30 on Saturday after getting back from a broadway show, but they said the bar would be opening soon & to come back down the next morning. It was storming the next morning, so I never made it up there with my girls. Maybe next time.The hotel room had a view of water towers not much else; I would definitely recommend the higher floors. A positive, with the room facing south, it was very quiet as far as no street noise. The doors to rooms are extremely loud when closing though, so we could hear those during the middle of the night at times. The room was spotless (which is huge for me, especially traveling with little ones who are all over the place) beds were comfortable & room was cleaned & refreshed daily. The Keurig was a huge plus! Also requested a mini fridge & a couple foam pillows which were brought up. Loved the cotton balls in the bathroom for removing makeup, I would order those myself if I knew where Hilton ordered them from. Small, dense & soft :) the little things do make a big difference. The location is great. We walked to Google to meet a family member for lunch & a tour, walked the highline, walked to Chelsea piers so the kids could play, walked to Madison square park, & plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. There’s a great coffee shop just around the corner & a Whole Foods a couple blocks away.

This could have become a big problem if it had occurred more frequently, but fortunately it only happened one time. (Note to maintenance - there was a noticeable air gap at the edge of the door which probably lets sound travel quite easily.) The hotel's location turned out to be very convenient in several ways. We enjoyed the on-site restaurant for breakfast, where we opted to eat twice. We ordered from the menu. Everything was tasty, and there was a nice selection. We also visited the ale house directly across the street in the evenings, which was a very convenient location. The subway station was only a short walk from the hotel.

No noise coming from the street as we had an office building as our view. Downside : shower in our room was bizarre. You had to reach in to turn it on and a glass wall was blocking the faucet which made it really hard to adjust the temperature before getting in. I'm not sure why most hotels have not switched to handheld showerheads to avoid these problems. The room was quite dark and even with all the lights on you cannot get proper lighting.

I had always preferred to stay in Hilton in my travels but will likely think otherwise after this.First of all, the lifts were slow/congested and I have to wait 10mins to get down from 12 floor. Secondly, when I checked out on 26 December, I was late for 2 hours and I was informed that I will be imposed a late charge ($75?) even though the check in time for others was 3pm. Anyway, I was running late for my flight and can't be bothered to argue with the service staff and just need my key to be operational again. After I bring down my luggage and returned the keys, there was no mentioned about the late charge nor was I offered a receipt which in my mind was terrible service. At the very least, I should be offered the receipt or for it to be sent electronically.This is the first time I was imposed a late charge by Hilton for running late and never had that experience when I stayed Hilton in Asia. I am a HHonours Member who should have some slight discretion on the late charge when that is one of the benefits of the membership.The only good thing about this hotel is that it is a stone throw from Madison Square Garden if you are catching an event which I did on Christmas day on the NBA match between New York Knicks and the Sixers.

Situated a short walk (10mins) from Macy’s, Empire State Building and Maddison Square Gardens (basketball etc). A bit longer walk to Times Square, but still walkable (20 minutes). 20 minute walk to Chelsea Market & 10 minutes Walk to the High Line. For Battery Park, Central Park, Wall Street and 9/11 Memorial, subway is recommended. Nearest one is one block away, a 5 minute walk. Within walking distance there are shops, cafes, fast food places and places for breakfast. The area is fine and well placed for walking to attractions, but very busy. Our room facing the road (16th floor) was a little noisy during the busy hours outside. Ask for inside facing room if don’t like noise. The views are poor anyway, so you won’t be missing much. I think if you are looking for an area that’s a little less busy, more classy and you don’t mind a 10 minute subway ride in to mid town, then Central Park area is where we would recommend.The hotel is about an hour’s drive from JFK airport. Use the yellow cabs at the taxi rank. Fixed fee of $52, + tolls (I think it was $6.50 for the tunnel) and then any tip you wish to give. Now the hotel is fairly business like. It’s situated very close to 7th Avenue. The lobby is small, but due to the glass front, allows lots of light in. But what more do you need in a lobby then a check in desk and lifts. There is also a restaurant (fairly large) within the hotel if you want to eat there. Rooftop bar, which we didn’t experience. Appears out of the 3 lifts in the hotel, one is dedicated to the rooftop bar when it opens. If wish to us it, have to return to lobby to get lift back up, no matter what floor your room is on. Breakfast wasn’t included in our room rate and is an extra. Free (basic) WiFi. Free maps of the city. Luggage storage after check out.The rooms were fine. Clean, comfortable and all we needed for our 5 night stay. Large bed & comfy. Safe to use for valuables. Desk with chair. TV. Mini bar (charges to your account when remove items), free bottled water on our first day, iron & ironing board, coffee making facilities (no tea), wardrobe, chest of drawers and bedside drawers / lights. Bathroom was fine too. Clean. Fresh towels daily. No bath, but walk in shower. Hairdryer provided. The rooms are quite small, but seems to be standard for NYC. Was still large enough for the two of us and large suitcases, but not spacious. We found the interior lighting very poor. Was fine during daylight hours, but during hours of darkness, the lighting in the room was rubbish. The heating unit was also quite loud when it started up. Staff were good. Mostly helpful, friendly and happy. Provided good service. One fault with the staff, is the cleaner that decided to start hovering outside our room at 6am. Not cool! Allowed us an extra hour in the room after our check out time (1pm) on request. I would recommend avoiding the hotel’s own airport transfer service. We got ripped off. Wish we took a yellow cab now. The sign on the desk states fixed rate of $73 from hotel to JFK. I was told by staff this includes tip and tolls. This is more than a yellow cab (fixed airport price of $52), but when you add toll and tip, it seemed acceptable so i didn’t have to faff about hailing a yellow cab. Staff told me a yellow cab would be between $60 and $70, depending on the taxi meter, which is a lie, as it’s a fixed price to the airports, as set by the local government. Clearly wanted me to use the hotel airport transfer service. Firstly, the driver spent the whole journey on his phone. Secondly he took a detour around the tunnel, to avoid the toll (which was paid for in our fee) increasing our journey time to around 90 minutes. Thirdly he was nipping in and out of traffic, coming on and off the main roads to kangaroo jump traffic queues, fourthly he charged me $80 when I paid, claiming ‘tax’. He was quite insistent I paid cash, but I didn’t have any so this wasn’t an option. I challenged the fare, but he was adamant $80 was the price. Not wanting to get in an argument over $7, I paid this. This complaint is currently being managed by the hotel reception manager, but not yet resolved. ***avoid the hotel airport transfer service***Overall, this hotel was great for what we needed. Clean, comfortable, safe and a good location. Very pricey (£200 a night) and definetely not value for money, but it was xmas time and all hotels were expensive.

Reception did provide a couple of bottles of water and whilst it was an inconvenience, these things happen. They had resolved the issue within a few hours and things remained ok for the rest of our stay. Above and BeyondI have to say that where the hotel really excelled was the additional service they provided. I had been in touch with them prior to our arrival to let them know that we arrived on my fathers birthday and that the next day I planned to propose to my girlfriend, so could they give me a price on a bottle of champagne on each day to mark the occasion. We arrived to champagne to celebrate my fathers birthday and the next day following my proposal we came back to our room to flowers, balloons and wine to celebrate our engagement. It was an incredible gesture and one that made our stay all the more brilliant.

The staff was friendly and the lobby was nice. The room seemed clean. I had no issues. That said, for the price, you can find a nicer hotel. The walls and windows are VERY thin. I could hear my neighbor's tv as if I was in their room. And I could hear every sound on the street (and it's a side street). Sound doesn't bother me at all - I even sleep with the tv on. But it would definitely bother someone more sensitive than me. I'm not a large person, and the shower was very narrow. Just washing my hair, my arms banged the sides of the shower. Again, this is nothing to complain about. But there are other options with larger bathrooms.Overall, it was a good location when doing business in the garment district. It's certainly not cheap, though, and for the money, you can stay at a newer/larger hotel. I'd stay here again if I needed to. ",,madysonb888,23,3.0

I had never stayed in this neighborhood before. I chose the hotel because they seemed to be the only of the big chains that didn't jack the room rates to the sky during the week.  It was about 1/3 the cost to stay at this hotel compared to Times Square or the Financial District. The rooms are small, but no smaller than any other Manhattan hotel. It's in a great location, a short walk to 2 subway stations and Penn Station. It's also a short walk to the High Line. The hotel is on a lightly traveled side street so getting a taxi can be a chore, you're better off walking out to 6th or 7th avenues. The bellman has access to a car service so getting to the airport is easy and the rates are competitive with cab fare to LaGuardia. Dining options in the immediate neighborhood are little limited. The front desk staff was very friendly and always helpful. We had a problem with the water pressure in our sink and they sent an engineer up right away.A couple of things that need improvement. Hilton has a Digital Key system where you can check in before you get to the hotel and use the Hilton Honors smartphone application as a room key. But if you don't select that option before checking in at the desk, it can't be added. Additionally, the hotel charged my credit card for an extra $50 per day for incidentals. That wasn't disclosed in any of the reservation information. I expected a hold when I checked in but the charge was put through the night before I arrived. Despite the hold, charges from the restaurant and bar were also put through on my card over the course of the week. It all settled correctly at the end, but if you're close to your limit, you might have a problem.Much is made about their rooftop bar. Despite staying on the 22nd floor, right below the bar, we had to go all the way down to the lobby to get on the dedicated elevator to the bar. When we got to the bar, the open areas on both ends were reserved for private parties, the only area available to hotel guests was in the middle of the bar, which is under a roof and not open like the ends are. If the hotel is going to advertise the bar as a hotel amenity, it should be more accessible to guests than it is.","Raleigh, North Carolina","ncatrione</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Raleigh, North Carolina</strong>",6,4.0

Whatever it was, they were clearly a happy team. Then, I saw them in the hall. There was lots of laughter, but they took the time to include me by offering me water.The rooftop bar is not to be missed. GREAT views and again...warm, friendly, efficient staff.It's not the most convenient for walking to Broadway shows, but I purposefully chose it to stay away from the craziness of the theater district but still have easy access.The gym is very small, but you can get a workout done if you know what you are doing. Lots of smart choices were made by the designers in terms of space usage.The rooms are NYC size (small), but it's well-decorated and in good shape and are clean.","Atlanta, Georgia","Dale D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",3,5.0

This hotel was clean and the staff was nice. The location was a little farther walking from our activities than I realized (5th ave area shopping, 30 Rock, etc), but once we started to learn our way around, it didn't feel quite as far as it had at first. The restaurant breakfast was lacking, as the menu was verbal and limited (3 or 4 items) and didn't open until 7:30 or 8:00. Further compounding this, there was no hospitality in the form of immediate access to coffee or tea in the lobby (I don't care for Keurig coffee - there was a Keurig machine in our room). On the other hand, the beds were very comfortable! The mattresses felt newer and the pillows were great. I'm not typically someone who sleeps well, and I slept well both nights. I'd say my overall suggestion to this hotel is to start providing coffee or tea, around the clock, somewhere in this hotel! I think the lack of this, or a coffee shop across the street, tends to add to the feeling that this location isn't as convenient as a tourist would want.

It is opened to everyone as it is by Rare Restaurant. Rooftop bar experience was great. Beautiful view of the city and good house wine. Breakfast was great actually. Huge portions and lots of choices on offer served by Rare. Service here at the hotel and restaurant were all quite nice and friendly. The room was fine and the bed was comfortable. Loved the amount of towels and pillows they provided. I appreciate that and even the set up was elegant. Although, the maid did not clean up some soap residue in the shower area, but the room was clean and good besides that. Loved the Keurig coffee machine and so easy to use and the instructions and reminders were a neat touch. I learned how to use Nespresso, now, but this machine was much easier to use and in a way it a bit more high-tech. I do wish they had an executive lounge for their gold and diamond members. Also, I do wish they were more proactive and accommodating to allow complimentary late check out for its gold and diamond members even if it is by an hour or two. A little gesture can go a long way.

I've staying in this particular hotel twice now this year, and possibly even reviewed it on here. I am a Diamond HHonors member.I took the option to pay extra for a ""high floor"". This is a 22 floor hotel, so given I was paying extra was expecting floors 19+. I got 16 (room 1611 to be precise).I have 2 reasons for wanting a high floor - in NYC the higher you are, the quieter it is. You also have some chance of not looking straight across into someone else's room. This was singularly the noisiest hotel room I have ever had the misfortune of staying in. I arrived on a Saturday and the noise from the street below was extraordinary. From groups of people in the early hours (most likely spilling out of the hotel's rooftop bar) to the garbage truck every morning between 2 and 4am the amount of noise coming in the obviously cheap and not-soundproof glass was extraordinary.On top of that 1611 seems to be opposite some sort of linen closet where the staff felt the need to slam the door every 20 minutes all night. In the course of a 4 night stay I estimate I slept no more than 2 to 3 hours each night.To add to this the toilet obviously had an issue with a valve as water ran through that all night - this was mostly drowned out by the AC but on top of everything else it didn't help.The next issue was breakfast. In all my experiences in HHonors hotels the Gold/Diamond members get access to the full breakfast buffet. This was also the case in my previous visit earlier this year, but by this visit it had changed. We are now offered a very limited option of 4 or 5 a-la carte options and not allowed access to the buffet. The options are poor. On the first morning I had a croissant with bacon/cheese - it was terrible and took 45 minutes to be delivered. One of the reasons I like the hhonors hotels is because I can get a quick buffet breakfast before going to meetings. I don't have time for an hour round trip (due to elevators - see below) from my room for a greasy croissant. Downgrading the breakfast like this is cheap. I was paying $400+ a night for this stay, don't save yourself $2. I gave up going for breakfast an instead picked up something on my way to the office. My wife went for breakfast one more time to give it a try and see if it improved - it was a hot morning and she was refused any cold drinks - only tea and coffee were offered. Simply abysmal way to treat customers.The next issue was the elevators (or lack of). This is a general issue in NYC but normally a hotel like this with 3 elevators can be relatively efficient. This isn't the case when one of the elevators is blocked from guest use so it can be exclusively used to ferry non-guests to the rooftop bar. This confirmed the elevator was working, but still during the day it was locked off from guest use leading to some VERY long waits. This was exacerbated on my final evening when they had delared this elevator broken, and decided to still reserve one of the elevators for non-guests to get to the rooftop bar. This meant a single elevator served the entire hotel. I waited 25+ minutes to get down to street level. For over $400 bucks a night, you must be joking!A very bad experience - I did somewhat raise some of these issues with the staff, but after my attempt at explaining why the breakfast was no good I didn't see the point pushing it further, I will just remove my custom from the group instead. I see you value your rooftop bar customers higher than hhonors guests.","Hamilton, United Kingdom","DaOrange</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamilton, United Kingdom</strong>",22,1.0

No response, the lady was already heads down sorting through receipts. She didn't care. Breakfast was also poor. It took 20 minutes for my check to arrive after I asked for it. I even reminded 2 waiters. The place was not even busy (7:20am). And I'd love to see the box that the ""fresh squeezed orange juice"" is poured from. The granola I paid $8 for was almost certainly made from Honey Crunch granola bars being broken apart - I even had a corner piece on my plate. And it's true that the elevators can take a long time.

The staff joked about the elevator not working, that they frequently break, and that they should have installed a better brand of elevator. It took over 2 days for the elevator to be fixed!

When I first walked into the boutique-style hotel and went into the room, my first thought was ""I should have booked at the Conrad""... however, that thought quickly went away.Yes, the rooms are small, but for New York standards, they were actually pretty sizable. I stayed in a two double bed room with plenty of room for me and my best friend. Great sized television, bathroom with hot running water at all times (these days, sometimes that's not a given, even at high brand hotels!), decent sized bathroom and great sized shower.Pros: internet speed was fast and reliable, and loved that I did not have to sign in every night. Also, as mentioned, room size was a pro (although, warning for non-new yorkers, rooms are very small compared to, say, a Hilton or even a Hampton in the west and around Texas... think of room sizes similar to London). Plenty of lifts and never had to wait for more than a minute or two. Easy access to taxis and Ubers always showed up within 3 minutes. And the beds! Probably one of the most comfortable beds I've had in a while in a hotel. Also, air conditioning works great!Cons: in the 14th floor and little to no mobile phone service (but thankfully, wifi was reliable and T-Mobile as free wifi calling which worked great! However, this may be an issue for other travelers). Also, it can get very loud in the lobby area at night due to rowdy parties, but thankfully it's quiet in the rooms! My room didn't have a great view (a brick wall), but this was not a big issue for me, but may be for others. Still plenty of light coming inside. Rooms can be a bit darker, even with all lights on, but nothing too terrible.Overall, a pleasant stay. For the location, the size of the rooms and the price can't be beat! Hilton diamond member and had great service from the staffPlease be advised: diamonds, there is no lounge at this hotel.

I paid for a upgraded ""high floor"" view. They put me on the 22nd floor, which they said was their highest. The room had a beautiful view of the empire state building, but the noise ... They told me beforehand that the room was right below their rooftop bar and that I might hear ""a little"" noise. Little was an understatement. Listen, I love to have fun and don't mind a little noise - I don't book hotels in NYC Memorial Day weekend for a ""quiet stay"" but the constant thud of base from above from about 12 pm to 1 am Friday, Saturday, and Sunday was just a bit much. I really couldn't stay in my room during the day just to chill and relax - you have to turn up the TV loud to drown out the noise. At least one night I was trying to go to sleep before 1 AM - not happening with all that music. By the end of it I had bags under my eyes. For the amount of money I was paying per night to stay there, I don't expect that level of noise nightly - ya'll need that sound proofing asap.Also - the breakfast buffet was a little weak. Their process for seating is a little strange, they have a perfectly good back area to seat buffet guests but instead go through this off greeting process which takes unnecessary time. The food was mediocre for a what I would expect from a Hilton brand. There weren't many people at all at the restaurant yet the staff seemed to be hustling. They weren't very attentive to the buffet, food ran out and was not replaced speedily. Fruit was kinda stale - bananas were days old and had brown/black parts throughout when I tried to eat it. Bacon was fine though. Potatoes were a average. All around rather low quality for a Hilton imo.The rooftop bar itself though is pretty awesome and convenient for a fun time if you're staying at the hotel. Also the hotel's location and proximity to other NYC things to do is good.So, in sum ... PROs - location, rooftop bar, clean room, nice view on high floors. CONs - noise level on high floors interferes with sleep, breakfast is meh. Between the noise and and the sub-par breakfast I can't say I recommend you stay here unless there's some sort of special. For the amount I paid, I wasn't completely satisfied, especially about the noise. If you ARE going to stay here, request a floor with a view but DO NOT accept the 22nd floor, or bring some earplugs.","Morristown, New Jersey","MichaelAV228</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Morristown, New Jersey</strong>",0,3.0

Having previously stayed uptown we wanted to stay in a new area when visiting with our two children (aged 12 and 9.) I had been attracted to the roof top bar and then I realised under 21s are not even allowed in a bar so I emailed the hotel to see if we could get a room overlooking the ESB as the kids would not be able to see the view - unfortunately didn't not get a reply from the hotel.When we arrived hotel staff were very friendly and welcoming. We were told all family rooms were at the back of the hotel. As we opened our door we were met with perhaps the most underwhelming view ever - a brick wall!! As a result the room was so dark and we had to have all the lights on at all times.The pictures of trip advisor are not a true reflection of the room we stayed in. On the plus side the room was clean and functional and the beds were comfy. The bathroom was nice and the shower was lovely. The room was also quiet - brick walls don't make much noise at night!! The hotel is nicely located and we enjoyed spending time around the Flatiron building. It's also well placed for a walk uptown or downtown.The three star review is not really a criticism rather an indication of how underwhelming the hotel was for us as a party.

I answered that I understood only two days before arriving may have been too late for this, but that due to a medication I have to take, I really could use a mini fridge (because this particular medication must be refrigerated 24/7). I had planned on using an ice bucket and filling it up with new ice 2-3x a day to keep everything cool, but the mini fridge would make everything easier and less stressful. Turns out two days before checking in wasn't too late for this Hilton hotel! When we checked in, they not only knew about the request at the front desk, but my mini fridge was in my room, connected and already cool when we arrived! This sounds ridiculous, but it really made the difference for a perfect, stress-free vacation because we didn't have to think at all about the medication and whether or not it was at the right temperature... The hotel staff was as friendly as can be, everyone from the front-desk to the cleaning and maintenance team. We met the lady that would clean our room 4 out of the 6 days we were there, and they were always helpful and asked if we found everything to our liking and offered any extra help we could need. The last day, she even offered to help with our bags when checking out... they really went the extra mile.On top of everything, the hotel has the perfect location in Fashion District, walking distance from great restaurants, across the street from Whole Foods, two blocks away from a subway entrance, etc. I can't recommend this hotel enough, and I really guarantee that I won't ever book a different hotel in NYC.

It’s really well located, on 26th Street, between 7th & 6th Ave. Easy walking distance to Penn Station/MSG and handy for the 1 & 9 (Red) metro line.I love the clever cotton reel Mondrian in reception. The fresh flowers in the lobby are always spectacular. Check in is always efficient and friendly and I’ve many times been allowed to check in early on arrival in the morning, if my room is available. They have a great driver service to JFK. It’s always pretty easy to get a taxi outside.You need a key to go up in the elevators – so it feels safe. This hotel is very good about not giving out room numbers. My colleague and I always test them as we check in on different days. They will dial a room for you, but won’t give the number out.The restaurant located downstairs is good and has a nice ambience. I really like the breakfast. Rooftop bar nice too, when warm enough.The size of bedroom is dependent on it’s placing. Rooms at the back of the hotel, with no view, appear to be larger. Suits me … I’d trade the view for a larger quieter room with no road noise! Black out blinds are great. The room has air con that works.The rooms are perhaps not the brightest, the décor is quite dark at times, but the white bedding brightens it up. I don’t love the dark blue carpet and won’t be sorry when they change this. There’s a Keurig coffee machine in the room which is also a bonus. The bedroom is an ok size and the bathroom clean, modern and usually a descent size. There’s a full shower unit, I’ve never seen a bath in any of the rooms I’ve stayed in – just a glass shower. The bathroom has a light that automatically turns on and off at night which is handy. The bathrooms vary, again dependent on your location, some have a larger counter vanity area and others just a small one. Normally plenty of towels. The hotel photos on the Trip Advisor site are representative of what you get – minus the fresh flowers in the room!Price wise, I think due to it’s location, this hotel can often be a bit more expensive than other similar properties in it’s category.

The metro/subway stations are not that close to the hotel (about 2-3 blocks) so it all depends on what your agenda is and where your business is taking place. ROOMS:The room was actually very very small. The lighting was poor and it was impossible to see/operate the safe (in the closet) without a flashlight as there is no light in the closet and you can't see anything without a flashlight. If you left the drapes opened, there was zero privacy so everyone in the building across the street could you inside your room. There were no sheers behind the drapes. The bathroom was OK, although there was no counter space to put your things on...so they had to be left on the top of the dresser in the room. Not very convenient to say the least. The toiletries were very small but replenished every day so that was OK.There was a Keurig coffee machine which was nice but no mini fridge to put anything in. You have to request one to be brought up in the room. The bed was OK as were the pillows. The room was very clean. If you are a light sleeper, you hear everything in the hallway. We were at the end of the corridor as far away from the elevators you can be and still heard them and all the doors opening/closing, not the best insulation. We had a room facing the front of the hotel on the 9th floor and could hear the cars honking & the trucks going by all night....a higher floor at the back of the hotel would be much better (we requested one upon check-in but were told that due to renos taking place there were none available).The service was very very good, nothing to complain about. They were very accomodating on all levels. Given the amount of money you spend per night, we expected a bit better given we've had better and in better locations in NY for the same price.

First, even calling to try to make my reservation a couple of months ago was a disaster. For some odd reason that I cannot comprehend, I couldn't get through. It was as if something was wrong with their phone system. I tried literally dozens of times to get through. I would have given up after just a couple of tries, but this was a reservation as part of a wedding block so I was feeling a bit committed to this hotel. Then I had problems with the block, such as availability (when we were still well within the window), pricing was off, and minimum nights stay was incorrect. Basically a disaster. Finally we got the reservation locked in, after a million calls and much wasted time. Then, nightmare part 2, which I'm still suffering through. My plans have changed and I need to change my arrival date. Over the past 2 days, I have been trying to contact the hotel at their main number and I literally cannot get through. Many many times, it has just rung and rung and rung and then I get a beeping noise and disconnected. Finally last night I was able to get in contact with someone at main guest services and tried to change my reservation. After 25 min of trying, they were unable to get into the system to change my reservation. They suggested I try back AGAIN this morning, which I did. So...again this morning I had to try several times to even get through. After getting through to someone at guest services, SAME THING. She was unable to change my reservation in the system. Said the reservation system was down. She also couldn't get through directly to the hotel, and SHE IS IN GUEST SERVICES!! Even she was blown away and couldn't understand what was going on. If it was just a one-off thing, I'd say whatever...the system goes down every now and then. But this - I have never seen anything like it. I do A LOT of travel for work, and have called hotels a million times. The difficulty I have had with this hotel has been unrivaled. I don't even want to call them again, but I'm forced because I need to change my reservation. Something is seriously wrong here. I hope once I get there, the hotel doesn't suck, but I'm so aggravated already and I haven't even gotten there yet. Not looking good. Good luck staying there if you can actually make an accurate reservation and get through to someone.","Fayetteville, North Carolina","Erica D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fayetteville, North Carolina</strong>",2,1.0

At one in the morning. Not cool. My daughter and I checked in late on Friday, March 3rd. We were so tired. In the hall of the 5th floor, the location of our original room, there was a strong smell of pot. When we got to our room, we noticed that smoke was coming from under the door. The smell and smoke were terrible. I put a towel under the door to try and stop it. I could plainly hear the girl next door coughing and arguing with a man. My 17 year old daughter finally told me that we needed to call the front desk. I did and they sent ""security"" up to check it out. This amounted to a man knocking on their door asking them if they were smoking. The man next door said ""Is there no smoking allowed?"" (All through the closed door). The security man said that no, smoking wasn't permitted. The man in the room shouted that he was in the shower and to go away. The security guy left and the people next door sprayed cologne that smelled really bad in an effort to cover up the smell of pot. The front desk called and asked if I wanted them to spray neutralizer in the room and I said I would prefer to move rooms. Because of the late hour, we got moved but to a smaller, handicap accessible room with no counter space in the bathroom and a smaller bed. I was happy to move but when we got up early the next morning for her college visit, we were very tired.I was disappointed to know that when a guest breaks a hotel rule as well as the laws of New York State, absolutely nothing happens to them.

It was my fourth visit to NYC, and I wanted to explore a little more of the ""local"" NYC rather than the touristy stuff, so I decided to head south of all the tourist traps but still be central enough to see it all. Hilton Fashion District was the perfect choice.A fresh feeling place that was clean and well appointed, I was lucky enough to score the high-floor room I'd requested, and had a great view of the Empire State Building. The room was small, but there was plenty of room for bags and to spread out comfortably. The wifi was fast, the room was clean, and satisfied all my needs. There was only a shower in the bathroom, rather than a bath, in following with the compact nature of the room, but this was also fine. The decor was a bit funky, and the view was suitably damped by block-out blinds so I could rest in the mornings after some very, very late NYC party nights!The hotel is in a great spot, being walking distance to Madison Square Gardens, and to Madison Square Park too. There are plenty of shops close by, and a good selection of bars and food spots just further up 26th past 6th Ave. The onsite bar and grill is also very good, certainly a step up from the usual middle-of-the-road type places you get in hotels, plus they have a rooftop bar too! The rooftop bar was cool, but you could only get snacks and the beer selection was a little small, but nonetheless, it's a great place to start the night. The hotel is also within walking distance (if you like walking) to the usual tourist spots around Times Square, Central Park, and in the other direction, Little Italy and the East Village are far but walkable (about 20 mins or so). So it's a perfect location!Staff were always very pleasant, and very willing to help with any needs (tickets, rides to the airport, requests, and the like). I was pretty pleased with my stay. The hotel is not a big flashy place like some of the other Hiltons, and the rooms are smaller, but it is still definitely worthy of the brand, and has a more local feel than a touristy feel.

I'm surprised that the Hilton hasn't given her a promotion as of yet, if not...they will lose someone with excellent customer service.Front Desk -- We had an incident happen early in the morning around 5am on Saturday with the bellhop pounding our door accidentally off course with a customer's suitcases with the trolley. My husband had to get up from bed and open the door to let the bellhop know that when he puts the suitcase on the trolley it hits the other room's door. I think it was just to close to the door for this to happen. We brought it to the attention to Sashika at the front desk, very pleasant individual and she fixed the problem immediately. That was really appreciated. We noticed that the hotel resolves problems and ensures that the customer is happy when they leave, which is smart as customers will return.

The main attractions of Midtown are all accessible by foot - we walked to 5th Avenue and up to Times Square.The front desk staff were all helpful and friendly, on a day that it rained we were able to borrow an umbrella from the hotel.After reading many reviews, I expected the rooms to be small however I was very happy with the size of the room - with plenty of space to store luggage and for two people to move around in. Toiletries were replenished daily. I would suggest adding more wardrobe space in the room, the single closet was rather limited - and there is plenty of room to add another one next to the bathroom.The bed was comfortable and I was able to get a good night sleep for the 3 nights we stayed in the hotel. Being on the 19th floor, we didn't hear any traffic outside. And the additional perk is we had a clear view across to the Empire State Building from our room.The coffee machine worked great. The only thing I'd suggest is providing more coffee pods. We were given two regular coffee pods and two decaf. We didn't drink the decaf, but would've appreciated another two regular coffee pods. Although I'm sure if we had requested this at the hotel at the time, it wouldn't have been an issue.There is so much to do in NYC that we didn't get an opportunity to enjoy the rooftop bar - but it'll be something to add to the list when we return.Definitely book this hotel if you're looking for somewhere to stay in NYC.","Barcelona, Spain","FrazJam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barcelona, Spain</strong>",113,5.0

I didn't interact with the staff much, but to the extent that I did, they were very pleasant and helpful. I really liked the location - close to Chelsea galleries and restaurants and the nearby subway made all other attractions easily accessible as well. I easily walked to Penn Station, with carry-on luggage, on my last day. The one design flaw was the light in the bathroom. It was on a motion sensor, so when I went in to the bathroom in the middle of the night, the light went on. Normally if I use the bathroom in the middle of the night, I won't turn on the light, as that more fully wakes me up and makes it harder for me to get back to sleep. It also took about 5 minutes after leaving the bathroom for the light to switch off. This pretty significantly impacted my sleep - but this might not be a huge issue for other people.

Booked Hilton based on its trusted brand and our past great experience in SC and Jamaica. It turned out to be a huge disappointment.Arrived on Christmas Eve afternoon. Hotel lobby was decked out in full holiday festivity. Staffs were courteous and attentive. Room 901 was given. We were impressed upon entering our room. Spacious room. Everything seemed to be newly renovated and well kept. Even the tile grout in the bathroom were toothpaste white. Room was pin dropping quiet despite it’s right behind elevator shaft. Everything seemed to be perfect.We returned the room after a fun night and great feast in the city. Once we laid in the bed, it became one of those “WTH” moment. If blindfolded and not seeing all the nice details we had been seeing, we would think we were laying in a bed inside a cheap road side no brand no star motel. It sank, wobbled, and offered no support whatsoever. Besides its bed linens was clean and no signs of bed bugs, we don’t even have HALF of a good word about it. But it’s late and it’s Christmas Eve, so we took it all in and decided to rough it out for a night then deal with it next day.Woke up the next morning after a whole night of tossing and turning, I ended up with the worst back pain in years on Christmas. Before leaving the hotel, I went down and explained nicely about our mattress problem to a front desk staff. Staff was nice and sympathetic. She offered to change our room to 1701. We took her offer. Before leaving 901, I decided to take the bed linens off and take some photos of the mattress. Not too surprised, the mattress was deformed to a degree that should’ve never be seen in a hotel such as Hilton (or any hotel that charges $150+/night). It’s a disgraceful sight.Moved into 1701. Like 901, same clean, quiet, new room. But we got smart this time, so we lift the linens to check the mattress beneath it first. Same brand of mattress. Although it’s only slightly, the mattress is still deformed. Now, we were not that impressed anymore.Before leaving the hotel, I expressed my concern to the same front desk staff again. She promised they would have someone look into it and maybe fix it. Didn’t know how you can “fix” a deformed mattress besides switching it out, but we decided to leave it to the professionals and left the hotel. Because the pain was so bad, we made a trip to Flushing for back massage before we could even start feel like a person again.Returned to Hilton at night. Manager left a voicemail saying they had the mattress problem fixed. Out of curiosity, we lifted the bed linens again to see how they did it. Well, it’s the same mattress. So what’s the “fix” that the manager was talking about? Turned out, the “fix” was that they put a wood board in between the mattress and box spring (see photo).It proved that the “fix” didn’t fix anything at all next morning. We still woke up with back pain and feeling exhausted. Didn’t believe complaining it again to hotel staff would do any good, we simply checked out and left. It would be awhile for us to book another Hilton in the future.","King of Prussia, Pennsylvania","Max L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>King of Prussia, Pennsylvania</strong>",9,2.0

FREE holding of luggage after checkout (Hey - Doubletree Metropolitan - lookee here!!! A service that should be free is actually... FREE!). Excellent rooftop bar - but you have to go to the lobby to access the facility (it's the far-right elevator as you face the elevator bank). They shut down this elevator when the rooftop bar is open, so only two elevators service the remaining floors. When you leave the rooftop bar, tell the elevator operator to stop on your floor.We had checked in via the app for a front/corner room on the 7th floor, but it wasn't ready when we arrived, so the desk agent ""upgraded"" us to a king room on the 18th floor. She did warn us that it didn't have a street view. .We took it. It was BEHIND THE ELEVATORS which gave me great pause.

I found the location to be convenient to restaurants, shopping and metro stops. It is a short walk to Herald Square and Fifth Avenue. There is a restaurant/bar (Rare) on the ground floor and a rooftop bar. However, the rooftop bar was closed during our stay in December. Our room was small, but this is New York City and real estate space is prime! There were a few challenges I found with the room. The closet in our room was configured in a way that my dresses and our long coats could not hang without crumbling at the bottom. I had to improvise using the door security hooks and towel hooks in the bathroom. The lighting was not great for applying makeup. I was glad I traveled with a magnifying mirror with a suction cup as I could not get a close-up look in the mirror. I attached this travel to the bathroom wall under a ceiling light. Typically these items would not be an issue, but we were in town for corporate social engagements and not sightseeing. The room was nicely appointed, had plenty of electrical outlets and a coffee maker which are more of the deal breakers for me.One other item to mention-ice had to be ordered from room service. I had a frustrating search of the room looking for the ice bucket and finally phoned front desk to inquire about ice. They informed me that ice is ordered from room service and placed the order for me. Delivery of ice each night was impressively quick!I would be happy to stay here again. The minor inconveniences did not negatively impact our stay and we were able to find solutions to the hanging clothes and mirror issue. Hopefully, the hotel staff will read this feedback and look into better solutions for its guests.","Greer, South Carolina","SASshipmateS87</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greer, South Carolina</strong>",68,5.0

But my last stay was at least three years ago. I like the hotel's central midtown location--near trains, away from Times Square, walking distance from many neighborhoods. The hotel was never luxury but always a solid 4-star stay for the price. Unfortunately, the hotel has slipped and is on the down slide toward shabby in several respects. The overall cleanliness of the room was acceptable (no bugs, clean sheets and towels, basically clean bathroom), but not up to the standard that I prefer. I was not happy with the grout, which is definitely starting to look grimy. Wood throughout the room was scratched up (furniture, headboard, bathroom vanity). The bottom of our window curtain was dirty, lamp shades looked a bit dusty. Our a/c unit was loud and did not turn on and off properly with the thermostat. Since I've stayed here many times, I knew as soon as I walked into the room that no updates have been made. While the bed sheets were clean, the pillows did not smell fresh.It's still okay in a pinch. For whatever reason, the NY hotel availability was very tight for the dates of my last stay and prices were very elevated. I managed to find a good rate on Hilton.com and because I was very familiar with this property, I went for it and crossed my fingers that things had been well maintained. I was disappointed but not so much that it ruined my time in NYC. But I travel to NY frequently, and have stayed at numerous hotels in the city that have been fabulous. There is too much competition for the Hilton to just let this property languish and expect people to return. Many of the problems I encountered are easy fixes.I am a Hilton Honors member. I did not like being solicited by a Vacation Club representative during my stay.","Chicago, Illinois","ChicagoJetGirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",22,3.0

It is in a great part of the city and very convenient to many restaurants. It is situated between 6th and 7th streets and is always easy to catch a cab if you aren't in the mood for walking. The rooms are a nice size, especially for a big city, I have always had a room with a King Bed so I can't comment on rooms with other size beds. The bed is comfortable and the rooms are nicely appointed, however they can be a bit dark even with all the lights on in the room. The bathroom is of adequate size and I have only ever had a room with a shower so I am unsure if they have rooms with bathtubs. The bathroom is nicely appointed with light tile and a bright light. If you are sensitive to noise or light I would recommend asking for a room on a high floor or on the back of the hotel. The back of the hotel is close to another building which appears to be office space. The front of the building faces 26th street so if you are on a lower floor the traffic noise and garbage trucks in the morning can be a bit annoying.

We have stayed here before and I have to say that this place rocks! From the minute we arrived, I receive a very warm welcome with a huge smile, AND a greeting from one of the many front desk people, her name is Sashika, that said, ""Welcome back Wendy, we're so glad to see you again""! She actually remembered me AND my first name. That was impressive by itself. The rooms at this hotel may be a tad smaller than an average hotel room but I have to say, for a New York hotel room, the size is perfect. I've also been to Boutique hotels where the rooms are only as big as the BEDS in the rooms, NOT so with this hotel. There's plenty of room to walk in the room and the rooms are handsomely decorated, believe me, I'm very picky about how a room looks in a hotel. We were on the 20th floor and our view looked out onto the Empire State Building and had a really nice citiscape view. The beds in the rooms are totally comfortable. I melt into their mattress and I always sleep well when I'm here. The three best things that I love in these rooms are the shower, the air conditioning and the Keurig Coffee Machine. The bathroom has been totally renovated and it has the most wonderful shower with clear glass doors, (at least mine did) very modern looking with marble. As far as the air conditioning is, I can't think of another hotel that has an air conditioner that works so freaking well that we always freeze in the room, because it works so well that we wind up making it a little warmer in the room. How many hotels do you know that the air is nice and cold the minute you walk into the room, this is during the summer months (and September) that I am referring to. And, how many hotels GIVE you a Keurig Coffee Maker IN YOUR ROOM? HELLO???? We enjoyed going up to the rooftop where there is a trendy bar and they make ""mean"" drinks there! Yummy!!! It gets very crowded (that's a good thing) so I recommend going up a little early to obtain seating. The service that the front desk provides,(I dealt with Sashika most of the time) is nothing short of a FOUR STAR hotel, I'm not kidding. They are at your service all of the time, and with a great big smile! Whenever I came downstairs into the lobby, Sashika was right there and would always ask me how I was doing and if there was anything that I needed. All of the front desk people were all trained very well in my opinion, which is probably a reflection on the management of the hotel. Sashika engaged with me throughout my stay, not just when I first arrived. Another person who I have dealt with in the past, and this last booking, who definitely deserves mentioning is Skylar. He is extremely professional and he really takes the ""edge"" off of making a reservation at a hotel and takes care of all of the other minutia for me. I just love pretty much everything about this place, trust me, I'm not an easy person to please but, hands down, you definitely get a bang for your buck here, make no mistake, just book it, you will wonder why you never booked here before...","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","wfriedman55</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",1,5.0

After many calls to the front desk who didn't seem interested in helping I was transferred to the main Hilton reservation line who told me that the computers were down and my best bet was to walk to the Hilton or Hampton Inn in Times Square and hope they had rooms. So at 2am, I did just that and they did not have any rooms. I finally managed to get a hold of a friend willing to let me sleep on their couch at 3am.

My family and I stayed here again for Labor Day weekend for the US OPEN tennis tournament. I must say, this place is the only place I will stay when visiting NYC. I called a couple days before my family and I arrived to speak with the front desk representative, Christine. Surprisingly, she remembered me and even remembered my room number I stayed in in May. She is a gem and such a pleasant person to interact with. I had three rooms booked and wanted to make sure all three rooms weren't side by side. I was traveling with my mom, dad and aunt. I love them dearly, but did not want them right next door. Christine, told me not to worry and that she would make sure the rooms aren't adjoining. I also asked for all three rooms to have a street view. She obliged and went as far as to upgrade our rooms without me asking her to and doing it for the same price as our original room. Her customer service skills are unparalleled. My parents had a GREAT time at the roof top bar and they couldn't stop talking about the breath taking views from the roof top bar. Whenever I needed additional towels, someone was knocking at the door within minutes delivering them. There are plenty taxis in front of the hotel. We chose to use Uber as the taxis were a bit more expensive. There is a 24 hour CVS right up the street and lots of places to eat in close proximity. If you're looking for a nice, clean , spacious room with some of the most pleasant people at the front desk, then look no further than this property.

What impressed me most was the quality of the soundproofing -- an unusually quiet room for NYC. Otherwise the room was undistinguished, but in a good way -- bland corporate furnishings, comfortable bed, small bathroom but with decent linens and toiletries.The one negative experience that we had related to the bar: We were staying at the hotel in connection with attending a Rangers game at Madison Sq. Garden, which is relatively close-by. When we returned right about 11:00 pm, we asked the front desk if food was still available; they informed us that the restaurant was closed but that the bar served food until midnight. However, when we arrived at the bar at about 11:05, the host told us that the kitchen was closed. I am fairly confident this was a matter of demographic stereotyping; I think that he took one look at our age (older) and the clothes that we were wearing (for a hockey game, including Rangers apparel and dad/mom jeans) and decided that we did not fit into the fashion ""hip"" vibe that the bar tries to project. No matter; we walked across the street to a Pub where we enjoyed a very nice late night dinner and some gastro-beers -- probably at far less cost than we would have spent at the Hilton.","Chicago, Illinois","MBA60302</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",97,4.0

Check in was smooth and quick plus what was amazing was that they had my room ready around noon when I reached. The staff was friendly and welcoming as well. Another great thing was the AC, cooled the room to freezing temperatures super fast which was lovely as NYC was hot as hell during my visit. Oh I also got a view of the World Trade Centre from my room, the windows were nice and big. iPod doc in the room was also appreciated. Now onto the bad. Noise levels were terrible as the walls were paper thin. I often felt someone had walked into my room when it was probably into the room next door! That was quite alarming. I could also hear loud conversation for a few hours from the neighbouring room around 2am which interrupted my sleep. Other than that there was no fridge in the room and also no ice machine in the hotel, ice could only be obtained through room service for a charge which is terrible in the summer.

I made sure to call the hotel a couple of weeks before our arrival to let them know that I had to make 2 separate reservations as I was using HHonors points for 3 of the nights and paying 1 in cash and I did not want to have to move rooms after the first night. The person I spoke to said to just let the person know when we were checking in as it shouldn't be a problem. I had hoped they would put a note in our reservation but didn't want to force the issue as I trusted that they knew the hotel better than I do. When we arrived, the front desk agent was not aware that we had 2 reservations and had to spend quite a while rearranging things so we would not have to move rooms. She mentioned a couple of times that she was having difficulty because there was a ""regular"" guest arriving and she could not move his room. A couple of times she went to (who I assume was) the manager to seek assistance. He seemed very dismissive and made no effort to welcome us or even acknowledge us as we stood there while she tried to figure it out. It just came off as a little bit discourteous. There was no verbal recognition of our status as HHonors members, nor the fact that it was my husband's birthday (I made sure to note that when I made the reservation online). As an HHonors Gold member, room upgrades are given based on availability. Again, no mention was made of our HHonors status or what kind of room we were being given. About 5 minutes into the check-in process while she was trying to figure out the room, I had to ask if there was a room available on a high floor. She said she was trying, but had to accommodate the regular guest. I realize the value of a regular guest, but I also know the great amount of effort that I put into saving and planning for this trip, including agonizing which hotel to stay in and choosing this one based on the reviews of good customer service. The agent did come knock on our door shortly after we got in the room to bring a bottle of wine and a birthday card that had apparently been placed in the room we were previously assigned, which was very nice. Again, I really wasn't expecting a huge over-the-top welcome, but a simple ""Happy Birthday"" or ""we see you are a Gold member so let me see if there is an available upgrade"" would have gone a long way. It just wasn’t the warm welcome I had been expecting. Other than the check in experience, the front desk agent was very nice and helpful. She very quickly sent up a bucket of ice upon our request and also quickly had a mini-fridge sent up to our room at our request. The room was great, very clean and in good condition. Bathroom was pristine with no signs of water damage or wear and tear. The housekeeping service was impeccable. The hallways upstairs appeared a little worn and the lighting in there is WAY too bright. We were offered vouchers for the continental breakfast or vouchers to a little deli around the corner. If you are offered this, DEFINITELY take the vouchers for the deli! Great food and quick service. You can eat there or take it to go. They have all kinds of prepared and made-to order foods, plus a little market. The checkout experience was not great really, the woman working the front desk was not very friendly and the gentlemen storing our luggage (who also hailed our cab) was quite unfriendly and barely spoke to us or looked at us. And yes, we did tip him. Not sure what the problem was. Overall, I was satisfied with the stay. There were some very positive experiences and a few negative as I previously mentioned. I guess I would rate my overall experience as average. While nothing was horribly wrong, I definitely felt like we were just another guest (other than the bottle of wine and the card) based on our interactions with some of the staff and the check-in experience. Overall, I would consider staying at this property again. However, I would not work so hard to save up HHonors points in order to stay at this property because of some of the experiences we had. I would come back due to the location and neighborhood.",,Stephanie A,0,3.0

The room was like the pictures and was comfortable with a modern bathroom (great shower). It didn't feel as small as some NY hotel rooms.

Good location if you are trying to avoid the crowds of Times Square. Hotel is in good shape and staff is good. All rooms are basically the same with the exception of the view. I think a high floor above the 19th floor would provide decent views. Hilton Hhonors benefits are lacking at this property. Gold/Diamond members will be disappointed that there is no executive lounge and breakfast vouchers only get you a basic continental breakfast. Most Hhonors guests will find it is best to use the voucher for a coffee and/or juice and to go out and grab a bagel at a local shop. The rooms do not have a fridge for guests and be careful not to pull items out of mini-bar fridge unless you want it (automatically charged unless you call lobby and return item to them). There is a rooftop bar, which is available to the public and being a guest does not provide any benefit (i.e. you don't need to stay at the hotel to be able to go to the rooftop bar). The bar was closed both nights for private events, but staff did let us go up and see the view during the day for a few minutes. Fitness center is adequate for a short stay as it is pretty small. The fitness center is a little larger than a hotel room (including the bathroom) and it is has treadmills, elliptical, free weights (up to 30 lbs.), and a universal cable machine. They did a decent job with the layout to get most items in a fitness center that you would expect at a Hilton flagged hotel. However, if multiple people (3) are in the fitness center it will be cramped and you may need to wait to use the equipment.","Denver, United States","Jeffrey C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, United States</strong>",0,3.0

After a brief walk, we were checking in less than 10 minutes later! The hotel looks brand new and from the moment we walked in the staff was very welcoming and gracious. Caroline checked us in and she was very professional yet sweet. Based on other TA reviews, I requested a room on a high floor and towards the back. We were given room 1401 and while I was nervous that it was close to the elevator, we never heard it. The room was nicely decorated but it being in NYC on the smallish side.

The location is perfect. But, we were on the 22 floor under the rooftop bar and the noise was disruptive to the point it was hard to go to sleep. I called the front desk and was told they tell everyone on the 22nd floor about the possibility of noise - implying we knew what we were getting into and that we needed to accept it. We requested a change of room on our first night's stay and were told to pack our bags and have the ready the following morning and they'd be moved to a new room while we were out for the day. We were up early the following morning, packed our bags as we were told and went out for the day. We returned just before lunch to find our room had not been relocated, so we changed clothes, repacked again and were told we'd be in a new room that evening. It was understandable as the check out time had just passed so it made sense to us. We returned after being out with friends for my birthday dinner only to find we had not been moved - we were told our request had been cancelled - and the rooftop bar was busy and loud again. They told us this would be the last night it would be loud as there was no DJ on Sundays so we stayed. We love the Hilton brand and had stayed at this property before and intentionally chose to stay here again because of the level of service and the location we had experienced during our first stay at this property 3.5 years ago. However, this was quite a departure from the level of service and professionalism we've grown accustomed to within the Hilton family.

So I almost talked myself out of writing this review. But then I realized that sharing wonderful things with the universe is an act of good karma that will hopefully circle back to me someday. So here goes: When I am in NYC, I sort of expect to be treated brusquely at best, if not downright ignored. So imagine my surprise upon first walking into this establishment and finding pleasant, happy people eager to assist me and my husband after our long, tiring flight. Shout out especially to the sweet, pregnant girl who checked us in (ashamed I didn't ask her name). This eagerness to assure our good stay was evident everywhere - from the doormen who greeted us every time we left and every time we returned, to the elevator attendants to housekeeping - and even to the staff at the on-site restaurant Rare, where we ate dinner on night two. The host saw me attempt to descend the stairs (did I mention my foot was broken?) and guided us to the elevator that led to the restaurant's lower level entrance. We told the waiters we had a show to catch and they managed to be not just prompt, but courteous and engaging. Food was delicious, too! And then there are the rooms: Scrupulously clean. Decor was very chic and updated, but also comfortable and inviting. Yes, the room was small, but it was intelligently designed. We had plenty of surfaces to store our things. Bed was luscious and comfortable.Bathrooms are brand-spanking new. What a relief! No tired water stains, rusty faucets or musty/moldy smells from leaky pipes. New upscale fixtures and counters, big roomy shower with new fixtures, heavenly water pressure and endless hot water. Soooo important! Equally important are the little details that are usually missing in other hotels, like Q-tips and cotton balls in a nifty stainless holder and a tray for my sundries from home. The final too-good-to-be-true aspect of our stay: It was quiet. Yes, really. I always bring earplugs when I am in town because of the inevitable fire engine at 3 a.m. or noisy adjacent guest returning after a night of revelry. Amazingly, I didn't need them. We requested (and paid a little extra for) a high floor (worth it!). Our room faced an apartment building/alley and not the main street. It was a wondrous surprise to wake up only once, and only when our alarm went off after a good night's sleep. Location is good too - between 6th and 7th Ave. We are evangelical about mass transit, and the subways are very accessible from here. Station for the 1, 2, 3 trains is right around the corner at 7th and 28th and 7th and 23rd, while the B,D,F, and M are on 6th Ave. and 23rd. It is also very easy to walk to Penn Station, which we did one night for an express ride to Yankee Stadium. Whole Foods and Duane Reade are on 7th. Walking distance to the High Line (fun afternoon!). Plenty of restaurants and bars in the nabe, although we patronized the friendly Crompton Ale House across the street for late-night snacks and tasty adult beverages. The neighborhood is more busy New Yorkers/ FIT students, less pushy, frenetic tourists. Thank goodness. Listen, the staff had me at ""hello"" - literally. All the rest summed up to an amazing, yes, perfect - stay. Highly recommend.",Colorado,"BrooksideOk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colorado</strong>",4,5.0

When I arrived, I was greeted by Christine. She was pleasant and extremely welcoming. The HUGE SMILE on her face as she greeted me, made me feel like we were good friends who hadn't seen each other in a very long time. I arrived at the hotel around 1 p.m. not expecting to have a room available. She gave me 3 room options and told me that a room was available for me. As she checked me in we exchanged pleasantries and I mentioned to her that I was spending my anniversary at the property. She told me, ""Congratulations,"" handed me my room key and told me to have a GREAT STAY. I went to park my car at the garage down the street as it is cheaper to park at the garage than having valet park the car. The only minor issue was that there is no In and Out parking if you use the garage. After I parked the car, I went upstairs to the room. The room she assigned had a street view and I loved it. I stood at the window whenever I was in the room and people watched. The area is bustling and has every store, restaurant and pharmacy either across the street or around the corner. The room was surprisingly spacious and VERY CLEAN. The bathroom was a nice size and the bed was clean and comfortable. I was in the room for an hour before I realized that Christine sent a bottle of wine, 2 bottles of water and a greeting card to me for my anniversary. The fact that she did that shows that she will go above and beyond to make your stay special. Thanks Christine. I called down to have food delivered to the room and within 20 minutes someone from the hotel delivered my piping hot meal. I actually ordered the kid's (don't judge me) chicken tender meal. I couldn't believe how large the portion was. I'm a BIG GUY and I couldn't finish the meal. The following morning I went down stairs and was greeted by Caroline. She was just as friendly as Christine and it felt like I've known these ladies for years. I asked for a nice breakfast place in the area. Caroline suggested, ""Malibu Diner!"" The food there is unbelievable. Breakfast, lunch and dinner was AMAZING! If you go there, you have to buy a slice of cheesecake. It's the BEST DARN CHEESCAKE I've ever tasted.If you're looking for a hotel that's in walking distance to Time Square, Restaurants, pharmacies, banks then look no further than this hotel. The maintenance, customer service, location are unparalleled. Trust me, you won't be disappointed if you choose this property.Also I got a good rate on this hotel by joining Hilton Honors.

I had the misfortune of staying on the street side (12th fl) on a Thursday night, and there was a trash pickup operation across the street that went for almost 2 hrs from about midnight to 2am. Felt like we were in an echo chamber, with periodic clanging and banging of dumpsters etc., plus the loud noise of the garbage-truck(s) engine and compaction system. Seemed like they were emptying out the entire contents of the building across the street. And in the morning at 6:30am, another team came and spent a while doing the same on our own side of the street!As Hilton promises, the staff ""made it right"" the next morning and gave us a room on the alley side, and it was unbelievably quiet by comparison, for the next three nights. But we got only 4 hrs sleep the first night, and that was fitful, always waiting for the next ""gotcha"" (and it did come at 6:30am). The new room and experience was close to 4 stars; some nits but without the noise this would have been a hotel I'd return to.I don't know if the trash pickup is only on Thursday nights, or if this occasion with an almost 2-hr pickup was special, but I would never stay in a street-side room in this hotel again.Perhaps the saddest thing is that their automated check-in the day before offered me a large selection of ""upgraded"" rooms on both sides of the hotel, and **I** picked what looked like a good room with a view, on the street side.

Unfortunately I booked a king sized room as this long weekend was going to be just my wife & I but we decided to bring my two boys (just under 4 & 2 years old respectively) with us and I forgot to alter the hotel reservation. They front desk staff noticed the two little ones and apologized that she could not provide me with a room with 2 queen beds but the hotel had cribs. I mentioned that we would crush together and be alright as I wasn't sure I'd want my smallest one in a communal crib. She urged me to take a look at them as they appeared clean to her and are barely utilized. We agreed she would send one up and it was actually a nice pack/play. My son wouldn't sleep in it but I would have felt comfortable if had wanted to do so for the evenings. Naps were a challenge as the room we had was on the 20th floor tucked around an immediate corner so the elevator shaft was on the other side of the wall. (My HHonors profile requests away from the elevator but it being a small hotel I didn't think there would be many options for switching rooms.) It being NYC it was a very small room and the bed was sub-par. They also don't have any bath tubs which led to 2 very interesting showers for the boys. As my wife said...the view we had was of ""rustic turn of the century water towers."" These water towers are on top of most buildings in SOHO--unique. The best part of our stay in my opinion was the coupons they gave us for being a gold member for a deli around the corner. They gave me 2 $12.50 vouchers per day and it sure did stretch -- not to mention, the breakfast was phenomenal. We ordered 3 full breakfasts (boys sharing), beverages, and a banana for the road which amounted to just under $12.50. This left me we another $12.50 to spend on random supplies we took with us for our day in the city. The deli had everything you would expect from your local grocery store and some international candy. Although the price for the made to order breakfast was extremely reasonable the rest of the store was premium NY pricing. I am usually pretty bummed when a Hilton doesn't have a lounge or the hours are limited--I did not feel that way here. The restaurant on top of the hotel does not seem affiliated at all other than clogging up an elevator each evening. If you plan on going to an event I would suggest printing your tickets before arriving. We had hockey tickets for a playoff game down at the Barclay Center but the 2 hotel computers could not open Adobe through ticketmaster. The pleasant front desk assistant took a look at the computer and couldn't figure it out either. She was nice enough to have me transfer her the tickets and she printed them at the check in desk. In the end it was adequate for three nights but I'd only come back if the price is right compared to the other NYC Hilton family of hotel locations.","Dallas, Georgia","timothyr911</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Georgia</strong>",9,4.0

Each time, I have enjoyed a combination of the hotel's facilities and service, and have emerged a very happy customer.First, there's the facility. Hilton's website says the hotel was built in 2010 -- and it certainly feels new. Every room I've stayed in has been in top shape -- clean, efficiently designed, well-organized, and stocked with a few office supplies and a minibar. The hotel rooms and overall facility appear well-maintained. I've not seen stains, tears, holes, worn materials -- any of the indicators of a poorly maintained hotel.Some have commented that the rooms are small -- my response to that is, you're in a building that probably maintained the footprint of its predecessor in a row of buildings dating back multiple hundreds of years -- you shouldn't expect anything else. I would also suggest that most travelers using this hotel are doing so for a business visit to the Fashion District -- so hanging out in a large, airy room for long periods of time is likely not a priority.The other highlights of the facility (for me) were the Rare bar/restaurant and its rooftop extension. The food at Rare (I had lunch there twice) was excellent, as were the cocktails.I also REALLY enjoyed the service. When I checked in and out, regardless of whether it was 2 in afternoon or 1 in the morning, staff was on hand at the desk, and they were, to a person, quick, competent, friendly, and courteous -- even in the middle of the night when I arrived after a delayed flight. They stored my luggage, hailed me a cab, arranged a car service -- all efficiently and with a smile. The bartender and waiters/waitresses at Rare were awesome -- friendly, talkative, quick, competent, thoughtful are adjectives that come to mind.The Hilton is also just a few short minutes' walk south of Herald Square (about 8 blocks), a few minutes' more walk north to Times Square (it really is an easy walk, and you're motivated by the fact that you can see Times Square from many blocks away, so it feels close while you're walking), and is located near several decent restaurants (Friedman's for breakfast, Smithfield for lunch, Flatiron Grill for dinner/drinks, etc.).Overall, I enjoyed my stay thoroughly, and I recommend the Hilton highly to any travels to NYC -- be they for business in the Fashion District or while on vacation.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Brian C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",5,4.0

There were goods: the front desk folks were nice and helpful. Housekeeping did a great job. That said, there are just too many negatives. I am a Diamond Hilton member and I have stayed here twice, and just didn’t feel any effort to “take care of me”; no upgrades, nothing. The free breakfast that Diamond members get is not on property despite a great restaurant in the lobby. Somehow, Hilton can’t make a deal with the on-site place, so they give you a coupon and you can walk 1 block (2 mornings in the rain for me), to get take out food (the food was good though). The lobby is always a mess; there are always suitcases all over the lobby, which gives the hotel an unprofessional look. The concierge is a joke; the only thing they know how to do is to point to someone else and tell you to go see them.

Room service was great and the food was tasty. The coffee maker in my room was positioned too high - it was very difficult to make my coffee in the morning. The coffee cups and actual coffee were replenished each morning, but the stirrer and sugar were not. I did not complain nor ask for more, however, because I'm always running late. When I first got to the room, the TV remote was missing. Guest Services was very helpful and delivered one to me quickly, however the remote wasn't very responsive and the volume only works in increments of 3 - so it was always either too loud or too soft. The gym was fine enough - it was very small, but all I used it for was to run on the treadmill which was in very good working order. If I were to try and use weights, I probably would have been dissatisfied. Overall, my issues were pretty minor and I would still probably stay here again.","Miami, Florida","Christine A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",15,4.0

I had the most wonderful stay, the staff were so helpful in anything and everything that i needed. The reception staff were welcoming and very efficient we were checked in and into our room with in 5mins! The room was cleaned every day and clean towels given, room was spacious and had everything we need. With a safe and was provided free of charge.As this was my first time in New York all advice was greatly received so a quick mention to their concierge she was the most lovely lady and nothing was too much trouble! She helped us get our City Passes and booked us our transfers back to the airport which was a life saver. This was all done in 15mins and everything ran like clock work for us following the quick chat.The location was exactly what we needed, far enough out so that we could get some sleep away from all the nosy but close enough to enjoy New York in all it glory! Its a 10min walk from Madison Square Garden and Pen station which is perfect if youre getting the train in from the airport. It's about 20min walk from Time Square so its all manageable, also the Empire State Building is only 10mins around the corner. You will need to take a taxi down to the 9/11 memorial but it only costs $15.We ate at the Hotel restaurant one evening and had a lovely meal the staff were every friendly and food to a very high standard at a reasonable price, so i suggest you try it at least once. We also went to the rooftop bar for one drink and im telling you its a must!! It's the place to be, the views are amazing and was full with in 10mins of opening so definitely go check it out even if only for one drink.I don't have a single complaint about this hotel it was the perfect stay and i would recommend it to everyone.","Bangor, United Kingdom","RhianWynne</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangor, United Kingdom</strong>",2,5.0

This hotel is a short walk south from Penn Station so you don't have to bother with the subway or a taxi if you're coming from there. It is located right by the Fashion Institute of Technology, which may be important to some. There are tons of great restaurants right near by and also a subway stop.There is a rooftop bar that is open all year round that is awesome. They serve some tiny snacks and great cocktails. It's a nice atmosphere and I want to come back in the summer when they have it opened up. You can charge your drinks to the hotel room, but this is more than a hotel bar, it would be worth visiting as a non-hotel guest.As a Hilton diamond, we received 2 coupons for $12.50 off at a nearby shop or continental breakfast coupons. We did the continental breakfast one morning and we received a bowl of cereal and a wonderful basket of some breads and danishes, very tasty. Not sure if it would be worth upgrading to full breakfast because we weren't interested that morning (lots of brunch options nearby).The rooms we received was kind of tiny, especially the bathroom, but that is normal for New York. I'm not sure what the suite options are for this property, but might be worth asking if you need more square feet. The hallways can be kind of noisy because the doors close very loudly (and it's not rude guests, it's just the heavy doors). You can hear some noise from neighbors as well, but nothing worth complaining about when we were staying (possibly make sure not to get a room that can be connected if you are worried about that). Unfortunately, the mini-fridge was completely filled with drinks and snacks to be bought, no room for us to even put a water bottle.The one other odd thing is there was no doorman. There is a concierge so I don't have any complaints there, it's just odd not having a doorman to say hello to or ask a quick question about best bar to go to or something like that. Anyway, a very minor detail.

Initial impressions were good and it was easy to find being almost on the corner of West 26th and 7th Avenue and 6 blocks from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. One of the smaller hotels but very good nonetheless. Not being used to New York the noise from outside came as a surprise - sirens, taxi horns, refuse trucks et al all day and night! However, we were 'only' on the 10th floor and at the front so no surprise really. Despite only being 5 years old,I had to check the window was shut due to the amount of noise coming in. It was a poor design really for a relatively new hotel.Anyway, the room was a reasonable size, bed was comfortable, bathroom good but lighting poorly planned in the actual room. No proper cups - paper take away style - which makes sense since they don't have to wash up!A nice touch was the bottle of wine given to me as I had just celebrated a notable birthday - thank you! A downside ? Well we wanted to have a couple of proper glasses 'No problem Sir, we'll get them brought up' which they did. Except they wanted to charge 6 dollars just for doing so! A shock when used to UK hotels who just do that sort of thing and really unacceptable. We declined them as we thought they should be in the room like any normal hotel.

Overall, it's a nice looking hotel, with good amenities and better than average restaurant. Easy to walk to many areas too. Rooms are a good size for New York as well. You may be used to larger if you don't visit big cities often. Staff is adequate, but front desk is always talking amongst themselves and are really informal. I hate being asked for my room number, any good hotel has trained their staff for security reasons to not do this. Their room service staff is almost hostile, they say nothing and are super abrupt with you. The people who deliver your food want nothing to do with you either.It's been a frustrating experience as a whole. Ice cold water in the morning means starting your day with an awful shower. Water doesn't warm up after 20+ minutes. Shower is poorly designed as well, you have to drench yourself while reaching in to turn on the water.Heat is difficult to control, the room is never a comfortable temperature. I actually had to have my heat on and window open one night as the thermostat didn't seem to do anything.Blackout drapes don't work. I've spent way too long each night trying to lower them without breaking them, but they get stuck as they're on a chain. Housekeeping will open them in the morning, so you get to repeat in the evening when you just want to go to bed.I wouldn't come back myself, the cold shower and poor heating and cooling is enough for me, when you travel frequently it's a deal breaker unfortunately.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin","Cindy D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milwaukee, Wisconsin</strong>",14,2.0

Had some other things go wrong, but none particularly dire or ""I'm never staying here again and they should burn it down,"" you know? However, when I filled out the survey from Hilton after my stay, I was really honest about what they could have done. I then spent a few days corresponding with the Asst. Front Desk Manager Skylar. The authentic concern for my issues that Skylar expressed was truly impressive. He showed a genuine interest in understanding my experience and how he could make it better for next time. It was really nice to have that kind of acknowledgment, despite my issues being relatively minor (compared to illness, or like, lack of food...). He worked with me to come to a resolution quickly and in a generous way. It was also done in a way that wasn't just ""Here is a bunch of stuff, don't be mad!"" Our conversation (via email) was really great. I love Hilton Hotels, honestly. I've stayed with Hilton on a few different occasions, and this was the first time I've had problems.

We occupied 8 rooms in total. Before arriving I did enquire at the hotel about getting rooms on the same floor. However, due to the configuration of the rooms and the relative size of each floor, then this was not possible. When we arrived at the hotel, check in was fairly swift considering the number of rooms and I was sorting these out for everybody in the group. The majority of the rooms were double doubles. These were fine, although did seem a little small and access around the beds was a little tight. Perhaps my judgement is clouded slightly due to the cost of each room, especially as other nights nearby where about half the price at sub $100 compared to what we paid at $200 per room per night.The rooms were clean and tidy and the bathroom was of good size with plenty of towels. However, there was no baths and after a long day of walking around NYC a bath would be just what is needed.I used the onsite restaurant for breakfast as I had free continental breakfast. This was a fairly basic affair and I would have prefered a more substantial offering but this was not to be without paying for it in addition.Check out was again rather painless, although the lifts seemed to be a little slow at that time of the morning, although the lobby did not seem particularly busy. We stored our luggage for the day and the porter took this away on two carts. However, when we came to collect it he simply wheeled the carts out to where we were and left them for us to unload. The result was that i did not offer a tip. If you want tipping then at least make an attempt to offer some form of service.Overall the hotel was good, but i think I would probably look elsewhere next time, if only to have larger rooms, especially if sharing with others.The location itself was great as it offered easy access to the subway and not too far to walk to Empire State Building and on to Times Square.","Cumbria, United Kingdom","kevmajor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cumbria, United Kingdom</strong>",12,4.0

She arranged for my luggage to be taken up to my room while I checked in to make the process as smooth as possible. As I hadn't eaten, Mily pointed out some places that would be open for me to get food and also took the care to ask me if I'd like her to order food to be delivered to the hotel so that I wouldn't have to wait long for my food to arrive once I settled in my room.As a frequent traveler for business I had thought the days of customer service such as the one I received were long gone, until my stay at this Hilton!

We found it to be pretty quiet too (18th floor) Staff were always friendly and ready to help and give suggestions.We arrived early and were grateful for the staff to arrange for our room to be cleaned first so we could check in sooner - thank you!!Restaurant next door 'Rare grill' is a must... amazing food and service.Roof top bar is also a must do - it was only open till around 11 - 11.30pm but well worth it for the views and cocktails - delicious!Only negative was there was no free WIFI in the room which was disappointing. We ate at the restaurants a few times so managed to just use it then... not a deal breaker.We have travelled a fair bit and like to walk everywhere - this hotel was in a great location for a few reasons.- It was close to not one but two starbucks (hello free WIFI). Always our first stop in the morning :) - It was only about a 10 min walk to Madison Square garden and about a 20 min walk to Times Square. Very convenient for hop on and hop off bus tours- Right across the street from subway so super easy to get around to other areas- We were coming back later at night every night and always felt safe Will definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends and family and anyone who wants a reasonably priced hotel in a good location","Western Australia, Australia","smartin07</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Western Australia, Australia</strong>",23,4.0

The hotel is well located and if you are used to walking, its an easy walk to Penn Station 5th Ave, Broadway, etc. The front desk staff were fun and made the checking in process a breeze. What I should have done was taken the offer to upgrade to a higher floor as each night that I was there (on the 5th floor) I was woken up at 3:30 by the delivery truck, etc outside in the loading zones - its amazing how loud they were each night. I literally just got up at 4:00 and went to the hotel gym because there was no getting back to sleep.The gym is tiny, but it did the trick - the treadmils (2) were very good condition and there was an eliptical and a stationary bike as well as a free standing full body weight/resistance machine. That is all there is room for - its a tiny room. There was a yoga mat there, but it was so dirty and gross that I almost threw it away for the the hotel - they could use to invest in a couple more of those and toss that nasty one.The bathroom in the hotel room is large, with plenty of room for toiletries, curling iron, etc, but the bathroom is a bit dated, and there is absolutely no way of turning on the shower without getting assaulted with cold water - as you have to be fully in the shower to access the fixture, this a design flaw, and aggravating.

The hotel has no lounge or seating area so there is nowhere to sit when the weather is bad except in your room.

The location is great and we had a very pleasant stay. There were a few minor issues with our room, but nothing to complain about or majorly bother is. The lighting in the room isn't very good, there are plenty of lights but in poor locations so the room always feels dull. We couldn't open the blinds fully as our room was the second floor on the 26th street so New York City would have seen us getting dressed - and I don't think they would want that misfortune! Haha. It would have been nice to have a bath not just a shower, and our shower door wasn't sealed well enough so when we used it the floor would get a mini flood, we had to use the bath mat to soak up the water. Our bed was also only a double which is small for American standards, wish we had either two or a king size. There is a massive desk which would have been nice to have a mirror infront of to do your hair infront of/make up. There is only 2 mirrors, 1 in the bathroom & 1 on the bathroom door but it was awkward to straighten my hair there as had to move a chair over and my partner had to knock when he wanted to leave the bathroom so he didn't hit me with the door. The positives of this hotel majorly outweigh the very few negatives. The location is spot on, right in the centre of the city and close to many shops/restaurants. The staff were friendly and helpful. We had no noise or trouble our entire stay, we only heard sirens and car horns, nothing else. On our first night we were knackered so ordered room service from the restaurant rare where I have also left a review, the food was delicious, quite pricey but you get what you pay for, and for the convenience of it being brought straight to our room within 20 minutes was well worth the money. The bed was amazing, so so comfy, and after a long day that's what you want. Aslong as the room is tidy and the bed is comfy, what more do you really need? I would stay here again in a heart beat. The hotel also provide a service where you can leave your luggage until you leave which was handy for us as we had to check out by 12, but our flight was 9.35pm.

Specifically, I spoke with Jenny @ (212) 858-5888 on 11/18 regarding my request, all the impression that I got was either she was unable or unwilling to step up to the plate, which was rather disappointing given the Hilton brand. That being said, Elan at the front desk was able to identify a solution & remediate, which I really appreciate.As far as the actual stay is concerned, below is a list of my pros vs cons:Pros:• Location• Staff• Gym• Rooftop bar• Complimentary wifi• Comfy bed & pillows• Nice view of the ESB from my roomCons:• Although I was on the 19th floor, there seemed to be a lot of traffic noise & sirens at night. Additionally, I seemed to hear a lot of door banging as people leave/enter their rooms and the dumpster pick up at 5 am. So sound proof, or lack thereof, is an issue. If you’re a light sleeper, be forewarned.• The wifi was rather slow when I tried to watch a video• One of my rocks glasses was chipped. Housekeeper didn’t seem to notice.• I did not see separate recycle bin, the housekeeper could potentially commingling everything with the general garbage. • The Rooftop bar would close early if they’re not busy, but they won’t post any signs in the elevator or lobby.• The long 1970s florescent bulb in the bathroom has got to go!All in all, it was a decent stay despite some minor setbacks, but would consider staying here again if the management can close the aforementioned gaps.",NY,"a9z0</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NY</strong>",84,4.0

The sound insulation was very nice for the most part as my room was right next to the elevator and I didn't a ton of noise (Luckily). But the fact that I was there on business and a new customer to Hilton, not the way to make a first impression. The rooftop bar has amazing views and is beautiful but guests have to go to the lobby to then access the bar. Not a big deal, but just annoying seeing as you have to scan your room key to even get the elevator moving.The Staff was hit or miss. When I first checked in, I had an issue with my card and asked if I could split it over two days (Forgot to call my bank and let them know I was traveling and they lowered my daily limit for security reasons). I apologized and explained the situation. You might of thought that I had asked them to give me the room for free. They were very standoffish and treated me like I was a second class citizen. Sorry, but I don't believe in credit cards and prefer to pay with my debit card. That is just my thing. There was a female associate behind the desk that was helping the woman check me in; she was very nice and pleasant, but alas, for the most part, I was stuck with the woman that was behind the computer. I asked the woman checking me in if I could have a room on a higher floor and she snapped back and said that the room she is giving me is the best she has (Mind you my associate, who checked in later, got a much higher room that didn't face an office building). Then she told me to come down to the front desk in the morning and take care of the rest of the bill. (Don't know why she said this as they charged my card the remaining funds the following morning before I even woke up). I thought it was humorous because after this crazy episode, the associate who was very pleasant, tried to convince me to join the Hilton Honors program. Not if this is the service I am going to receive. Like I said, I gave this hotel a 3 because of the service experience. The staff seem to be a pretty mixed personality group. Some are extremely snobby and rude, and others are extremely pleasant and kind. But a few bad apples, unfortunately can spoil the bunch. But the rooms are nice and quaint. So if you use a credit card and have no issues paying for the room, I am pretty sure you will have a decent experience.

The second hickup happened at the hotel restaurant where i sat from 8:15 to 9:00 without anyone taking my order.when my group of colleagues arrived around 9, it took the waiters another 10 minutes to come take our order and the 25 minutes wait for the food were apparently cause by my ordering of a hard boiled egg (which should have been extremely overcooked if that were the case). Also we were told that breakfast was not included in the room, i now see that it was probably supposed to be when i visit the hotel website. One last thing is i am missing an envelope with cash as well as my blackberry charger which were hidden at the bottom of my suitcase together with my passport and other important stuff i did not want to carry with me on the street while walking around in the afternoon.

I decided to walk to Chinatown from here, onto the Brooklyn Bridge etc. and felt it was well situated for exploring Manhattan on foot from there, ranging up to Times Square and even Central Park should you feel so inclined (I didn't on this trip).All in all, a very comfortable hotel with a nice bed, bathroom and decent space.

I read that the rooms were small but they are really small. I felt like with two big suitcases and the two of us, it made it a little cramped but no big deal. I didn't think the staff was overly friendly either when we asked a few questions. My biggest tip though is that if they give you the free vouchers for continental breakfast at the hotel ask them if you can exchange it for the vouchers for Sunac which is the deli around the corner. We did the continental breakfast the first day and it was terrible, orange juice and dry pastries. After that I remembered reading that you could exchange your vouchers so we did that for the rest of the trip. Sunac offers made to order breakfast, a coffee bar, juice bar and a lot more. It's way more bang for your voucher. Also don't forget to go to the roof top bar, the views are amazing, we had their nachos and they were yummy. My only complaint is that they said they didn't have the stuff to make bloody Mary's! I think we would probably return to this hotel next time.

As a Gold member, I asked for a room with a view and was given a room in the back of the hotel facing another building about 10 feet away with busy workers - there was absolutely no privacy, so I had to keep the blinds drawn. The room itself was quite dark to begin with. The full length mirror was terribly placed by the entrance with a low light overhead, which made visibility impossible. The room and bathroom were very small, similar to other sliver hotels in the area. The in-room safe was extremely high, so unless, you are seven feet tall, you cannot see the contents without standing on something. Whoever designed the room didn't do a good job. The hallway noise was annoying with doors slamming throughout the night. One of the three elevators was dedicated to the rooftop restaurant which made the wait for an elevator excessive.

No, wait, rather I travel a WHOLE LOT for work. And, my company policy requires me to find reasonable accommodations wherever I go. This means that the Plaza and Four Seasons are a no-go on my expense account. This also means that it is challenging to find a NYC hotel that meets my expectations for cleanliness, convenience, and comfort due to A) Prices in the city, and B) Horrendously low standards for NYC hotels. Even brands I am comfortable with everywhere else can be dingy, rude, and poorly appointed in this city. Finding a great room and a reasonable price near my venue and in a neighborhood that is relatively ""safe"" is not easy. THIS PROPERTY WAS GREAT on all counts. Stay here and stop surfing booking sites now. * Comfortable beds and fluffy pillows* Keurig coffee pot in room* Decent brand of soap/shampoo provided* Security nice with room keys required to use elevators* Friendly and welcoming service throughout property* Interesting and affordable on-property restaurant/bar that also has rooftop bar (see ""Rare"" reviews elsewhere)* Room service prompt and priced same/similar to restaurant (Rare menu, essentially)* In-room Wifi had working signal (free premium for Hyatt elite status guests)* Room was very clean, spotless you might even say* Location is nice and was walking distance to my meetings in Chelsea as well as a Whole Foods if you want to keep some healthy snacks in your room.* High floor room was quiet except for notable (but rare) sound from room across from me when they slammed their door. * TV has many channels and an on screen TV listings guide so you can avoid the annoying clicking through 15 different sports channels to see if there might possibly be shows on that are of interest. I didn't try it, but the TV also had places to plug in devices so you may be able to do more there than just watch their free channels.Note that I opted for a quiet room and didn't care about the view (which you will note is awesome by others who reviewed the same property). I had room 2002, which is on the ""back"" side away from the street and had its own little side hallway and this GREATLY reduced noises from other guests and employees. I heard nothing but the door from the one other room that shared my little hallway. I pulled the shades upon entering and left them there for privacy as my ""view"" was directly into offices across from me. If you want a view of the city, don't book on this side. My room, 2002, was great for one person. As I said, it was quiet and comfortable. But, if there were two of us, the tight quarters and small bathroom countertop would have created a bit of a strategy to share the space peacefully. And, if a view is important to you, this isn't your room. The desk folks were helpful and happy to help, so be sure to ask about this if you are traveling with another person.Negative hotel could easily fix:- Towels were in need of replacement as they have become thin/dingy/rough and are not up to the standards of Hyatt. I travel to NYC for work only under duress, as it is a pain to get to Manhattan from the western states and hard to move about once in the city for business meetings. As a result, I start getting anxiety about my travel there as soon as I am told I need to show up. Thanks to this property's wonderful attributes, one BIG part of my stress is now gone. Yay! Bottom line: Stay here. Book now.","Lothian, Maryland","pg27101</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lothian, Maryland</strong>",24,5.0

We love the area and we love this hotel. This latest visit we stayed in room 2002. It was supposed to be an upgrade, but this was not my favorite room. It was smaller than some of the other rooms we've had at this Hilton, and had a weird orientation and an ugly view. We accepted an upgrade from a corner room on the 7th floor, but we should have kept the 7th floor room. The higher rooms are considered premium because of the street noise, but on the 20th floor you start to get noise from the rooftop bar. In the room, which was very small, it's showing some signs of wear. The wooden vanity in the bathroom looks like it's gotten wet too many times and the veneer is peeling. The water pressure was great on the 20th floor tho!One thing we don't love about this hotel is that the mini-fridge is stocked with so much stuff, you can't squeeze in anything of your own. We like to stash a water bottle or maybe some restaurant leftovers, but the mini-fridges here are stocked like vending machines. We called and asked if we could borrow or rent a mini fridge.

I had originally booked a different hotel for our two night stay in NY via Expedia, but I had a gut feeling that I should cancel that reservation due to that hotel’s recent negative reviews. I am so glad that I did! Our stay at The Hilton Fashion District was perfect in many ways. To me, top notch customer service skills are a necessity in ensuring that guests enjoy their stay, will return in the future and will recommend to others. Many hotels have not yet figured out how important this is. The hotel staff delivered outstanding customer service from the moment we walked up to the front desk (Caroline and Zenibel ?) and throughout our entire stay. We arrived around noon, far earlier than the official check-in time. I was not expecting our room to be ready and if it were a king room it would have been, but we were a party of three booked in a two bed double room. The cheerful front desk clerk took my cell number and called about two hours later to let us know our room was available. We were able to turn our luggage over to the courteous bellman for holding so that we could start our city exploring. We returned to the hotel around 9pm that night to check-in to our room. Room #1803 was a decent sized room for the city, comfortable for our party of three. The room, including the bathroom appeared to be tidy and clean, though some of the wood furnishings had some minor worn areas. The beds, double in size, were quite comfortable and the pillows were firm, yet soft, perfect for good sleeping. The bathroom was better lit than most, with an added bonus of a lighted magnifying mirror if you desire to see facial imperfections you never knew you had. The bath linens were bright white and thick. I do wish more hotels had exhaust fans in the bathroom to get rid of the steam after a hot shower, this hotel did not. The vanity space was large enough to hold the toiletries of three females. There was a stocked mini-fridge with the usual outrageous prices. Sleeping in a hotel I need to keep the fan running overnight for decent sleep. We had ours on in the room, but it cut off and on all night which was a tad annoying. Our first night there was a bit of noise from the elevators late at night, but the remainder of the stay things were quieter. I assumed there was a little mini market on the premises to buy bottled waters, but told by the front desk there was not. They graciously handed me three waters without a charge. Oddly, we never saw any of the housekeeping staff, but had no issues in that department at all. On our last night we headed up to the roof top bar to check out the city lights at night and have a cocktail. The setting and view both perfect. Upon check-out on our departure day, the bellman once again took our luggage and stored it until we returned hours later. It was a scorching day outside and without asking the kind male front desk clerk handed us three bottled waters once again. When returning to New York, you can bet if the rates are decent I will be booking this hotel. You can't beat the location away from the madness of Times Square, but the subway stop is right around the block and walking to most everywhere is easy. Service was outstanding from all staff.

I let the hotel know we'd be a late arrival, after 10:00 p.m., which was not an issue. Front desk was helpful, courteous, and accommodating. Was asked if we preferred a view (street side) or not. We opted for an inside room expecting it to be quieter than facing the street. Our view was of another building, but the room was very quiet (6th floor), even though the elevators shared a wall with our room - we never heard them. King room was bigger than expected, very comfy bed and pillows, super clean bedroom and bathroom. A/C worked perfectly. Bathroom is a bit tight, but no real issues - a little bit more counter space would be a bonus.The rooftop bar was a nice surprise and a great place to enjoy wine or a cocktail while taking in the view - great view of the Empire State Building and lower Manhattan. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, only because of existing dinner plans.If you're considering this hotel, note that 26th street is not exactly the prettiest street in town.

FIT is at the corner, the famous Flatiron Building is also in walking distance.Nearby on 7th is a Starbucks, Pret A Manger, and Whole Foods, always nice to have around. The Flatiron Room is a block away, and the NoMad Hotel is a 5-10 min. walk, both great places for dinner, cocktails and music.We considered other hotels - more 'boutique', more 'trendy', more 'designed' (and all more expensive) - but have no regrets choosing Hilton Fashion District.","Plano, TX","TominPlano</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Plano, TX</strong>",5,4.0

The hotel is close to several major subway lines, making transit throughout the city easy, and the neighborhood is relatively quiet. Short walk (< 1/2 mile) to the High Line trail, a fairly new must-see oasis above the city (get there early in the morning- it gets very crowded after 10:00 a.m or so). The High Line basically takes you to the doorstep of the new Whitney Museum.We stayed on the 21st floor, considered a premium room and larger than rooms on lower floors, though still small by most standards in the US. Closet very small (there is a safe in the closet). The desk area is very functional. The bed was extremely comfortable and the blackout shades on the windows actually did the job. Everything was very clean; wireless worked fine, and there are easily reachable A/C and USB ports in several locations. I've stayed here several times before, and the vibe is consistent: everyone working at the hotel is relaxed and still very professional. I've never had a problem before and this trip was no different. I read a prior review that said they were not ""allowed"" on the rooftop bar even though they were hotel guests. That would be so unacceptable, so I had to check that out. We had no problem at all, and it was a busy holiday weekend. FYI: there are great views of the Empire State Building, it's sort of small, and it's a 20s 30s crowd.We didn't visit the fitness center. We had breakfast in the hotel, and while the buffet was pretty standard, the 'maintenance' was not. The buffet was fully stocked and clean every single day, thanks to an employee who monitored it constantly. Seriously. Have brunch here and then splurge on dinner. The buffet is $22.If that's a little out of reach, there is a Whole Foods market 2 blocks away.One caveat: The rooftop bar is right above the 22nd floor. We were on the 21st floor. We heard the noise quite clearly every night, so if you want a quiet room, call and ask about proximity to the bar. I think any room below 18 or so, and not directly below, should be fine. Also, the bar (or the noise) closed down pretty early, around midnight, so not a big problem for us.So bottom line-- we'll be back.","Redmond, Washington","pajiko</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redmond, Washington</strong>",5,5.0

I chose this so my husband and I could enjoy the rooftop bar. We were on the top floor the 22nd with a great view of the Empire State building and right above us was the bar. You could hear the music from the room. When we decided to go up and check it out we discovered that our elevator does not take us there even though it has a rooftop bar option. Instead you ride down to the lobby. When I asked why I can't get there they said I had to make a long line they had that was to get into the bar. They also said it’s going to be a wait cause at the moment they are full to capacity. I was told by the doorman/elevator man that hotel guest do not have a priority and that they rent out the space from Hilton. I went over to the front desk to ask how is it possible that my room is right under the bar and I’m staying at the hotel as a paid customer but I have no priority over people that came from the street to get into the bar and I have to make a line behind them in hopes of getting in. The only thing the hotel desk told me was that they rent out the space and that there are other great bars in the area I can go to. The guy even recommended a rooftop bar that’s in another hotel. So Hilton did nothing to help. When we walked back toward elevator to head back to our room the nice doorman of the rooftop bar (that does not work for the Hilton) asked me if I still wanted to go up and let us go ahead with the next group without having to make line. So No thanks to Hilton employees, I was able to get up there. So if you are looking to stay here for location don’t, unless you are doing things Midtown and around Madison Square Garden. Hilton has better hotels in the area. If you are looking to stay here to enjoy the bar just know you don’t have priority as a hotel guest and be prepared to wait a long line. I do want to give props to the cleaning crew the room was clean and very comfortable every day.","Orlando, Florida","BerR614</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",19,3.0

With all the food choices in the city, we opted not to use our breakfast vouchers. At other properties, I'm used to full continental breakfasts, with made to order eggs, etc...not the case here. Voucher is good for only muffins, danish, croissant, strawberry jam, cereal, juice, and coffee.Overall, a great stay.

I was handed a Hilton labeled brown paper bag with two bottles of water in it and one voucher for a continental breakfast as my Elite Member benefits. I was told I had been upgraded to a higher floor room because of my status. The room was very basic but clean. Street noise is quite pronounced but it's NYC so quiet isn't what I expect. The bed and linens were comfortable. The bathroom had a few bottles of ""designer"" shampoos and other amenities but other than that there was nothing special. The room was small but again pretty typical of NYC. The view of 26th street was nothing special. You could see (barely) the very top of the Empire State Building. I was looking forward to visiting the rooftop bar but it only opens for the evening and during my short stay there always seemed to be a private party going on that overtook the small space. In addition, there was always a lengthy line to get onto the one elevator which is allowed to bring guests to the roof. You cannot access the rooftop without having to go back down to the lobby and go back up...very inconvenient and given that the rooftop bar is the one special amenity guests may see as separating this hotel from nearby competitor hotels, it was disappointing that it seems to be used more as a revenue source for outside parties rather than an amenity guests can use without hassle. The downstairs bar is rather blah with TV's turned up so loudly you cannot hear yourself talk. I ordered a glass of wine and ended up taking it to my room.Weekend breakfast begins at 730am so if you are an early riser, you'll need to use the horrid in room coffee maker or go around the corner to the Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks which opens at 6am. There was no coffee available in the lobby for hotel guests. Upon entering breakfast I was told I could upgrade to the buffet from my elite continental breakfast for only $7. I thought that was a very generous deal so I accepted. I was then told that my room companion would need to pay full price for the buffet since I only had one breakfast voucher. I told her I was familiar with the Hilton elite program and breakfast was for two people. She looked somewhat perplexed and frustrated. It seems the front desk should have given me two vouchers but only gave me one. After that matter was settled, the breakfast buffet was less than impressive: overcooked scrambled eggs, limp bacon, boring pastries. The fruit and juice were fresh. Smoked salmon was the only item that made you think this wasn't just any other buffet at any roadside motel. I'm glad I didn't pay more than $7. Decor seems to hint that the hotel wants to be a bit more trendy and less stoic than other Hilton hotels. And I appreciate that the cookie cutter formal was left behind. It's just that the middle level hotels in the Hilton brand (and Starwood and Marriott for that matter) don't do much to distinguish themselves from their less pricey sister hotels. There's really not much here that you couldn't find at a Hampton Inn. I certainly wouldn't mind staying at the Hilton Fashion District again but I wouldn't pay a premium over other competitor hotels like the Four Points Sheraton one block away.","Hyde Park, New York","MarkTravel616</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hyde Park, New York</strong>",49,3.0

What we got was the best and our experience with an exceptional human being set the tone for our whole visit. Katherine Ortega was the gal who welcomed us to Chelsea, and she handled everything with the courtesy, expertise and kindness that Hilton execs should be looking for in all their employees.Five lifelong friends visiting NYC 52 years after their previous trip together as high school seniors wanted two rooms close to each other. Is that possible? Check. Five friends wanted to pay separately, dividing the bill evenly five ways. No rolled eyes. No sigh of exasperation. What we got from Ms. Ortega was, ""No problem."" Check. We were well ahead of check in time but could we leave our bags? Check. ""I'll text you when I can put you in a room. Now what else can I help you with?"" asked our smiling soft-voiced angel. We wanted brunch and the on-site restaurant was not opening for another hour. ""Try Malibu Diner. Down three blocks and to the left.""The Fab Five wandered out into the glare of Sunday morning dazed and even a bit goofy with delight. As we walked to the diner, everyone expressed complete surprise over our wonderful experience. We had just finished our brunch when the text arrived that we could get into one of the rooms. We walked back to the hotel excitedly, heading toward the bellhop for our bags only to find they were already inside our room! Arriving on the twenty-third floor, we quickly found our room and stepped inside only to discover nice little treats and a welcoming HANDWRITTEN note from Katherine Ortega. I cannot tell you how thrilled we were that she had gone to such lengths to make us feel welcome and special.  Our rooms were spacious and immaculate. We loved the Keurig, the toiletries, the fluffy towels. We ADORED the comfortable beds! We were very happy campers. This hotel is located close to everything you need, and we really liked the area.

This hotel is on a cross street so mostly the area was quiet except for construction across the street from its entrance. It is very easy to drive past hotel because it is set back from street but that accommodates the half-circle drive where you can load and unload without double-parking. We used the 'official' parking garage in the same block and got the reduced hotel rate. Make sure your parking claim is validated by the hotel and that you tell the parking attendant that you are staying at the hotel. The parking garage was very full and I think the only reason they took our car was because we were hotel guests. As always in a city, allow time for them to retrieve your car when you go to pick it up. They are constantly moving around the cars within the garage and you will need to leave your ignition key. I used my 'valet' key after locking the glove compartment and trunk with my regular key. There were plenty of cabs in the area and the subway stop is nearby.

After researching every hotel in Chelsea and reading dozens of tripadvisor reviews I chose this property and I am glad I did! It met or exceeded all of my expectations. It is clear why this property has risen so quickly on the tripadvisor rankings for NYC.Room: The rooms are larger than average for NYC. They are impeccably clean with updated furnishings. The bathrooms have abundant storage (which I find to be highly unusual for NYC) with excellent products and great water pressure.Location: Centrally located and convenient to shopping, restaurants, theatres, sights and subway. It's close enough to the hub of activity yet away from the noise and crazyness of times square/theatre district. Service: Now for the best part! The thing that really sets the Hilton Fashion District apart from the competiton is the incredible staff. General Manager, Yaniv Packin, has assembled an all star team. I am certain that they are the reason for the rise up the tripadvisor rankings. My positive experience began long before we arrived in NYC. Elan Bielski, the front office manager, personally saw that every request we made was granted. His professional yet personal attention to our visit was the primary reason I chose this property over the many others in the area.

No maid service day two, so hard to come back after long day with no soap and one towel. Check-out on TV didn't work. Worst of all, could not lock room from either outside or inside, which I didn't discover until day of checkout. Fortunately no one came in but could have easily made off with my Ipad and cash.

I appreciate security features most of the time, but this was a huge nuisance. First, if you're on one of the bottom floors, you better be first in the elevator, or someone else will have entered a higher floor and taken off past your own stop long before you can get the right buttons pressed. In a crowded elevator, or even just having your hands full, nobody else can hit the button for you, so you have to jostle around people and objects trying to get everything keyed in before things start moving. And the keypads don't seem to always register the card taps well (indicated only by a microscopic little blinking light nearby), making it even easier to miss your floor.","Chicago, Illinois","ItsNannerpuss</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",10,3.0

She is real, sincere and professionally accommodating. I told her that I had personalbusiness and that was why I was early. She suggested I leave my bags and finish my registration upon my return at which point she could better grant my request for a room on a high floor with a view. I followed her suggestion, however upon my return Zoribel was no longer at the desk as her shift had ended but Mily and Kathy had been well informed by Zoribel about my request and both were eager to please. Such pleasant friendly engaging fun loving personalties. Who says New Yorkers and not Friendly! I was given a bottle of water, completed a short discussion on what is hot and not so hot theater wise in NYC, had my bags delivered to my room. I got my room on a high floor with a view thanks to the efforts of Zoribel, Mily and Kathy. My room was immaculate, the bed comfortable, the shower hot and pressure excellent.

The wifi. It's silly, but I've stayed at many, many hotels, most of which were of lower price, lower quality, and lower resources than the Hilton that offer free wifi. It's a small request and I was lucky to be in a situation where I didn't really need wifi at all, but for something that can be given at no real cost to the hotel, it's a silly service to deny people in this day and age. I visited several restaurants, stores and other establishments that were offering free wifi, so I personally think it cheapens the Hilton name to be one of the few that didn't offer it. I stayed at a Holiday inn over the summer that gave free wifi, is Hilton really trying to make or save a buck in saying it's not in the same class as the Holiday inn?

This is a small but good hotel. SUPER friendly desk staff. They were always smiling (and not in a fake way). Small - the entrance/foyer area is small and the rooms are small......it's NEW YORK! Using every square foot. BUT, it's not so small that it's uncomfortable. My room faced the street/front of the hotel. The beds were comfortable and bathroom was clean. The shower was ""awkward"" in that the door opened INTO the shower (would have been better if it was on sliders). So you jump in to cut the water on and JUMP back out to let it get warm (otherwise you are under cold water). Also, don't get a room in the front: the garbage trucks and traffic honk horns ALL NIGHT. I used earplugs to sleep. The HVAC system location (see pictures). It was COLD in NY the night I stayed and the HVAC system went from HOT to drafty (when it cut off). I realized that there was a draft around the HVAC system location, though the control/sensor was on the opposite wall. So, once the room became ""of temp"", it took a while for that draft/colder temps to reach the wall. This bothered me and I didn't get a a good night's sleep because of the fluctuating temps because of cold draft vs heat. Luckily, I was only staying one night or I would have asked to switch rooms. This hotel is located right between 7th and Ave of Americas (between 23rd and 28th street subway stops). GREAT location and because it's in the center of it all, it can be a little noisy. Lastly, MAD because I had to PAY for wi-fi (though I am an HHonors member) and it was SUPER/DEATHLY slow.

The two biggest problems are it's keycard system and it's antiquated tiny elevators. I travel quite a bit and have for over 25 years and I have never experienced as wonky a keycard system as this hotel has. I had to swap out my keycards 4 seperate times in a 24 hour period! It all started when I got on the elevator and had to swipe my card for access to my room. Since it didn't register, the elevator, full because of it's tiny size, zipped right past my floor and stopped at several floors on it's way to the top before descending, in which it stopped at many floors. After the first few floors, it was already full but it kept stopping, despite the fact that nobody could get on. When it finally arrived at my floor on the way down, I exited the elevator (about 10 minutes after I entered...no lie!). This is when the fun began as my keycards did not work on my door. After spending about 5 minutes trying as best as I can to get into my room, but to no avail, I finally located a hall phone to call the front desk. They asked me to return to the lobby to get a new key. As I had my luggage with me and knowing the crowded elevator situation, I declined and insisted that they send someone up to let me in my room. After waiting another 15 minutes, I called the front desk and repeated my request. Finally, someone arrived with new keys. After initially working, those keys also didn't work. At this point, I just pleaded with him to get me in my room so I could drop my luggage and freshen up as I was already 20 minutes late for a meeting. On the way out, I had to deal with the crowded elevators again and had to let two pass by before I could get on one that had room. Before I left the hotel, I got a new set of keycards. However, upon returning to the hotel that night, they still didn't work. Exasperated at this point, I returned to the lobby and firmly asked for another set of keycards. One my second night, I had to get new keycards once more. So, long story short...do not stay here unless you like wasting time and don't mind being inconvenienced.",Philadelphia,"JMMcCauley</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia</strong>",18,2.0

The rooms are nice, probably reno'd in the last few years, you can request Empire SB views if available.

We chose the hotel because it was the closest Hilton to the friends we were visiting but would seek it out in the future for any activity in NYC. When we checked in, we were told that we were receiving a complementary upgrade because of our gold Hilton Honors status. When we got to our room on the 20th floor, we could not figure out how it was upgraded. The view was not great and the room seemed like the tiny rooms so typical of NYC. The room was well appointed with a comfortable king-size bed and nice (small) bath with a nice tile and glass shower. However, it appeared that it was actually smaller than the rooms on the front side of the hotel (based on the map on the back of the door). In the middle of the night, we realized that the upgrade may have been that we were put on the quiet side of the hotel. My memory of every hotel in which I have ever stayed in NYC is hearing car horns all night long. In this hotel, it was quiet. This results from the placement of the hotel, on 26th street behind a larger building on 7th Avenue that shields the hotel from noise from 7th. By being on the back, we also avoided the noise from the front of the hotel. We both agreed that we would ask for one of these rooms again.

Check in upon arrival was quick with complimentary water, which after a long journey was a little gesture that was much appreciated. The lobby was very stylish and the staff were always ready to assist. I'd read reviews that commented on how small the rooms were and how loud the hotel was in general but I didn't find this to be the case at all. Our room was a good size with a large bed and plenty of storage and the bathroom was fantastic. A very large double shower, a great sized vanity with great lighting and some really nice toiletries. The flush on the toilet was probably one of the loudest i've ever encountered, it made me jump every time, but even having said that you could only very occasionally hear it from other rooms. The noise from other floors in general was minimal, as was the noise from the street - other than what is expected from a busy Manhattan street. The hotel offers complimentary wifi in both the rooms and the lobby, which for us was essential having no other internet access.

I originally chose the hotel for its location on walking distance from the art galleries in Chelsea and I come back for the same reason.A part from the location it is difficult to find other reasons for choosing to stay here when there are so many other/better options in New York.Sure, the staff is nice, I appreciate the smaller boutique feeling of the hotel and like the bar at lobby level but that is about it. The rooms come small, even by New York standards, and boosts nothing but the minimum expected although the beds are very comfortable. I can not imagine staying in the room I got this week if I was not travelling alone. The small size of the bathroom works when travelling alone but not otherwise. There is no space at all to unpack your toiletries and the shower is tiny.I also noticed that they hotel has reduced the benefits for loyal Hilton guests such as myself. I used to get a much-appreciated voucher for the breakfast buffet. Instead, this time, I was given a voucher for ""breakfast"" consisting of ""Muffins, danish, croissant, cereal"" and drinks (juice and coffee). Clearly not a part of a healthy diet (fat and sugar only and ZERO protein or nutrition from veg/fruit)!

My boyfriend was told by staff that parking on the street was fine as long as the meter is paid for so we paid for 2 hours, but we ended up with a ticket after waiting to check in and coming back out to get our luggage. Turns out it is commercial parking only according to the meter maid we spoke to that explained the confusing street sign. We ended up parking at the garage down the street. Now, we did come 15 minutes before check in and were told we had to wait until check in actually started to get a room. So we came back 20 minutes later and there was no one waiting to check in but we had to stand for a good 10 minutes to finally try to check in. They took my credit card and ID with no problem only to tell me that my room was not ready. We waited almost 2 hours after that to finally get our room keys. We showed up to the room which ended up being a double, one bed was useless because it was squeaky and the window faced what looked like a designer or artist's studio and some fire escapes. Check out took a while too, there were lots of people checking out so that was more understandable but most places I have expedited check out where you just mention what room you stayed in and leave, here it took longer. The room itself was quiet and like I said the location is convenient if you are visiting FIT or Parsons or shopping in the garment district but I do not think I would rebook here because of the inconvenience of waiting so long to check in and out.

I was told I'd have to pay for an extra half day for a 4 p.m. checkout.The only difference in the treatment between gold's and diamond's at this property is an additional 25% bonus points which aren't worth much with Hilton's recent deval.If you are gold or no status with Hilton, this is a good choice.

Loved our high floor room (19th) with a superb view of Empire State Building as I had requested. (Twin bed rooms are at back of hotel so we opted for double with the ESB view- SO worth paying the $20/30 extra for). Very clean room and bathroom, not huge but bigger than other NYC hotels I've stayed in. Shop around- I got a good deal on travelzoo.Location is excellent as >5min walk to red line subway to nip north to Times Square & beyond or south to South Ferry for Statue of Liberty. But also a short walk from Penn st & bus terminals- so if you are arriving by bus/train like we did it was so handy to drop our luggage off early morning and spend the day sightseeing.They also happily stored our luggage for free for us to collect in the evening before departure. We had planned to dine out but after long day sightseeing we opted to dine in- so glad we did- Rare restaurant on the lower level floor served us one of the best steaks I've ever had, and my daughter claimed the same for her burger. Decent selection of wine too.I would have given a 5 star review but my only gripe is the Roof terrace bar was closed both nights we were there (Mon/Tues). Whilst we couldn't have eaten there as over 21s only (my daughter is 8) I was looking forward to checking out the view and taking skyline photos -but when I asked if I could just go to take photos I was told by the restaurant manager no as it was locked up and closed Mondays in winter...when I asked again on Tues eve just before we left she then added it was also closed Tuesdays in winter (grrrr!) i was very disappointed given this was the busy Christmas week.I suspect it is closed a lot more than that in winter so if this is a big thing for you, check in advance. To be fair, when I queried at hotel reception they were very sympathetic- but the RARE restaurant & enclosed roof terrace bar is not owned by Hilton and 3rd party managed. I did stress that the enclosed roof terrace restaurant/ bar was one of the reasons why I chose this hotel and they really should stress on website if it closed often in winter.....even the flier in reception for it lists ""enclosed year round ski chalet""and refers to ""happy hours Monday- Friday"".That gripe asides, for location, friendly staff, impressive room view, cleanliness, decor & great steaks I would highly recommend this hotel. I look forward to returning with friends in late Spring when (hopefully!) the roof terrace bar will be open.","Cheltenham, United Kingdom","Chelt01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cheltenham, United Kingdom</strong>",46,4.0

I enjoyed the breakfast package each day, it made a nice start to the morning. I think the rooms in the rear of the hotel (on the elevator side) might be a tad smaller, but they are also a bit quieter-- not that the front rooms are so noisy that it's a deal-breaker. I and members of my family have stayed there five or six times in the last three years, so this isn't a one-time impression. Last December (2013) when I checked out, I stupidly left a favorite sweater (not cheap, plus it was brought back as a gift to me from Norway) in one of the drawers in the room.

We stayed here for 4 days this past week, and from the minute we checked in, we knew we were in trouble. As a Hilton Honors member, I like to be greeted as I normally am, in the Hilton way. There was no smile, no Hilton bag, no how can I help you, just a simple next, hand me your credit card, and here is your key. We checked in to our room in the 19th floor, and were fine with the size, considering it is NYC, however, we were annoyed by the lack of light in the hallway, making it impossible to look at yourself in the huge mirror, totally defeating the purpose. The room is way dated, and needs work, however, the worst part is that housekeeping failed to clean our room the next day, leaving us without clean towels, and other bathroom accessories. When we called the front desk, the response was unprofessional and nothing done to accommodate. We figured that by leaving the room by 8am and returning by 4:15pm, that the room would be clean, that was not the case. Front desk and restaurant staff, totally unprofessional. There seems to be alot of horsing around, but no real customer service focus. There is no accommodating on anything, and there is zero organization on baggage handling if you are checking out and your flight is late. As for the lobby, the guest bathroom in the actual restaurant takes the price for the most unhealthy and disturbing part. While waiting for our cab to the airport, in the lobby, we needed to use the ladies room. The young lady with long black hair and glasses that sits near the restaurant and lobby stated that we could use that bathroom. Upon entering, the smell of urine and the sight of urine was most disturbing. There was no way that I could use either toilet, for fear of catching something. When I notified the young lady, she made zero effort to call housekeeping, or provide any options. I had to wait until arriving to the airport to use the bathroom. This is really a bummer, I love Hilton and take pride in being a Hilton member, obviously, they do not.I give it one star, for location and accessibility to FIT, and the water pressure and for the partial view of the Empire State Bulding.P.S This location is extremely loud, you will hear the dumpster pick up after 1am.","Redondo Beach, California","Skye90277</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redondo Beach, California</strong>",32,1.0

The heat was difficult to regulate and we often found ourselves too hot or too cold. In spite of the foregoing, the hotel was clean and quiet and centrally located at a very reasonable rate.

The rooms are on the small side but always clean. All rooms are along a central north-south corridor that runs parallel to the street and the clientele are usually professional travellers so I've never had a problem with unruly fellow guests or loud neighbors.

At first we were impressed with the location and the cleanliness of the hotel, but soon after we checked our favorable impression quickly began to wane. In fact, by the end of our stay I was so infuriated with our experience that I needed to wait awhile to write my review to see if I gained some perspective. Unfortunately, my perspective has not changed . . . . As other people have mentioned, this hotel is noisy. Most of the rooms are right in front of elevators, and the street noise, even on the 20th floor, is quite loud. There were elevator bells ringing and doors slamming all night. You could hear the garbage trucks below around 4 or 5 in the morning. These were things I was willing to overlook because we loved the location so much. However, on the third night of our stay, our last night, the rooftop bar had a DJ. We arrived back at our room early, around 9 that night because we had a long day walking around the city and were to meet friends the next morning for breakfast. As soon as I entered the room, I could hear the base line of every song coming from the rooftop bar. Certain that a hotel would not let this continue past 11, I held my complaint in the hope that I would be able to retire around 11 or 11:30, but when the music was still blaring well past 11, I decided it was time to say something. I complained no less than 4 times in 2 hours, one time getting back in my clothes and going to the front desk, around 11:50. We were told they would ask the bar to turn down the music and that it would stop at 12, then after 12 it became 12:30, and yet at 1:15 am, the music was still blaring. The only reason the music stopped at 1:15, was because my husband went down to the elevator that took you to the bar and held it open until the bouncer escorting people out promised to stop the music. I began asking for compensation for the night after my 3rd complaint. I was given the run around, something about 10,000 Hilton points, and that it was not their bar and they couldn't control it. They offered to move my room, but I wasn't packing to move, only to repack first thing again in the morning for our departure. I shouldn't have to do that. I had security come to my room to verify the music could be heard, and he did indeed verify it. I told those at the front desk I would be speaking with management in the morning, and that since I wasn't given the service I was paying for, I expected to be compensated in full for the night. The manager did speak to us as we were checking out, and while his tone of voice was nice, I found it condescending. He lowered his voice, in the hope that we would whisper as well, so the other occupants in the lobby would not hear. We inquired about whether or not they owned the bar, and in contrast to what we were told the night before, they do indeed own the bar, and consciously allowed the music to blare because there were people staying at the hotel specifically for bar and they had to service them as well (we saw everyone being escorted out of the lobby, btw). He inquired why we asked for the upgrade to the upper floors if we knew there was a bar . . . Well, we had to inform him we asked for no such upgrade, were not told we were being upgraded, we thought there would be less street noise on the 20th floor, and were already checked in before we even realized there was a rooftop bar, which was 3 floors above ours. He pretty much admitted they chose to sell drinks over serving their hotel occupants wishes. I feel as a hotel, the occupants should come first, and that if they want to have a loud bar and occupants, the bar needs to be soundproofed. He did ask us what we wanted to ""make this better,"" and we had to say, yet again, that we wanted comped for the night. He then tried to offer us a free room in any Hilton hotel instead, rather than comping us for the room. We declined, because we have no clue when or where we will have the opportunity to stay in a Hilton again, and likely we would not get our money's worth for what we were paying to stay in this overpriced hotel. We insisted, and in the end did get compensated for the night, but we had to push, and I felt like after the wretched service we received, that we shouldn't have had to ask, and perhaps even been offered a free night in another Hilton in addition to being comped for the night. It is a shame, as Hilton Honors members who think this hotel is in a great location of a city we love and visit frequently, that we will never stay at this hotel again. Two stars are given only because of it's location and because the manager came through with comping us for the night. If you are a heavy sleeper and are not bothered by noise, or are a night owl, this may be the place for you, but if you like a good night's sleep, I suggest you look elsewhere.","Columbus, Ohio","Amber K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>",22,2.0

We were greeted by a lovely lady at the front desk, in fact all of the front desk staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is very clean and our room was spotless. We stayed on the 21st floor, our room was an okay size. We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building. It was very clean and the bed was so comfy! The only negative I have is that the rooftop bar was 2 floors above us and the noise filtered down to our room. It did go off around midnight on the Thursday and Friday nights but on the Saturday I had to phone reception shortly before 1am as it woke me up and I couldn't get back to sleep.... The guy at reception was very nice and the noise stopped shortly after. I definitely think some more sound proofing is needed though!We ate in the hotel restaurant on our second night, we had burgers followed by an Oreo sundae. the food was fantastic and not expensive at all. We didn't eat here again as the female who met us and showed us to our table was really quite rude and it seemed to be an issue that we wanted a table at 10pm (it's open til 11pm) so that put us off but the food was tasty. The hotel is in a good location. About 10 - 15 minutes walk from Times Square. It is about an hours walk from Wall Street, the 9/11 memorial etc. We walked there on Sunday morning through Greenwich Village and it was a lovely walk and didn't seem like an hour.

We came across the hotel while booking through Expedia and I'm so glad we did! The greeting from the front desk staff was so welcoming after a long flight and continued every day throughout our stay. Every morning when we left the hotel we were greeted with a chorus of ""Good morning!"" Our bags were taken straight up to our room with no waiting around when we checked in which was wonderful as four suitcases between two of us had become a bit of a struggle. Brilliant service from every member of staff, every single one was helpful! Melissa, the front desk manager, in particular made sure my stay at the hotel was memorable! She was terribly kind and helpful throughout our stay. We needed to check into our flight home and were offered the use of computers and a printer in the lobby with no fee. WiFi is free downstairs in the lobby which was great as I wanted to contact family on my birthday. Would have to pay to use WiFi in the room which is like many other hotels and perfectly fine.The room was a perfect size for two of us. Everything was spotless, and was the same when we returned each day. A wonderful bathroom with a nice big shower, plenty of towels provided and a few little extras. Views from the rooftop bar are incredible. As we booked through Expedia we were unable to specify that we wanted a room on a high floor for the great views, I would definitely book direct with the hotel in future to get this, it would definitely be worth the extra cost! We ate in the restaurant, Rare, one evening and the brilliant service was continued there. Very attentive staff doing all they can to help. Food is a very reasonable price and great quality. We ordered a bottle of Cava and asked if we could take it to our room to finish, suddenly more than one member of staff was trying to find us a stopper for the bottle!We have visited the city previously and wanted something a bit further out from Times Square for a change, but wanted to be close enough to go there. Times Square is walkable distance and this is a perfect location for Macy's, The Empire State Building, Bryant Park etc. Also very close to the High Line.

But that was okay for us, as we weren't in the room much time.The front desk staff was very helpful in providing directions and information we needed.The fitness room, while small was very nice.The location is fantastic. It is away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square with the many tourist and loud noises. However, its only 3 blocks from the subway station so you can get anyplace you need to. There are great restaurants and of course great shopping in the area. The hotel is a couple blocks from the Empire State Building. So that is also convenient.There is a rooftop bar in the hotel as well. We didn't go up, but there was a red-velvet line to get the elevator up there.

After a bad stay at another hotel I felt that it was equally important to share the good experiences. The only time I don't stay here is when the rate gets too high for my company budget, otherwise, this is the place for me to be. This is a great location in NYC and in a trendy area. If you are like me and hate the thought of going to tourist traps, this is a good option for you. Big enough to be a full service hotel, but small enough that the level of service is high.What really makes this place special to me are the staff members. Kathy and the front desk ladies are so wonderful. If you come back, they remember you, they use your name when they see you, and they SMILE. I've watched the staff bend over backwards for me and others at the property. The bellhops are so awesome too, friendly, polite, and willing to help you out as you come and go... please tip them, they work hard. Can't say much about the security staff, they don't say much or interact with guests. I've never stayed at a property where they make you feel comfortable and welcomed. What a novel idea for those in the hospitality industry!? Fitness center is small but nice, and the breakfast options are pretty good (best I've found in NYC hotels). If you eat in the breakfast area, you will be lucky if Maurice waits on you... I ask to be seated in his section every morning. I've never seen a young man so happy to be coming to work each morning and working the breakfast and lunch shift. Rare Bar as a whole is good. Great food and unique cocktails. John, the manager, is great and always greets me during my stays in the hotel. The rooms are smaller, but so is every other room in the city. This hotel is CLEAN though, and in years of staying here, I have never, ever had any issues with housekeeping, cleanliness or anything of the sort. They bring chocolates at turn down service, so take the ""do not disturb"" off the door around 3pm or you will miss them! The rooms are comfortable, well decorated, and quiet at night. I don't like to stay too far up on the floors (there is a rooftop bar at the hotel), so I try to stay a few down from the top.I really can't say enough about what a wonderful property this is. I am finishing up my travel this week for the rest of the year and am planning to do something nice for the staff members at this hotel before I checkout this week. If you travel often for work, you understand that a great stay makes all the difference for your trip.I've been reluctant to say how wonderful this place is because I don't need it being sold out... but they deserve the praises. They do a great job, and embody the ideals of top notch service. I got a real kick out of people who gave this hotel poor reviews. Shame on you. Internet isn't free at any hotel unless you are gold/ elite/ platinum/ etc. This hotel is no different. If you want a family friendly hotel with a pool and activities for kids, you can probably gather that there is no pool here and I wouldn't think that taking my kid to a bar would be appropriate anyway... Things happen, problems come up, mistakes to bills are made. It's all part of travel and I'm pretty sure that front desk staff are not doing this maliciously. I don't understand the complaints about the front desk staff, but have witnessed the terrible way that ""some"" guests speak to hotel staff (at all hotels I'm in), and if you think that you can be nasty to someone and they continue to smile at you, well, you are misinformed and unrealistic.I see some people complaining about location. This hotel is near several trains (you should try them sometime), and it is easy to get a cab. You can walk up to 34th street and the shopping there too if that's your thing. This hotel doesn't market itself as being in Times Square (but there are Hilton properties there if being in a jam packed crowd is your definition of family fun).So, the bottom line is that this place is great and I just wanted to give thanks to the wonderful staff here. If any of the managers read this post, please do something nice for them when the opportunity presents itself! I hope you are proud of their efforts.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","TravelDoc716</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",7,5.0

We walked from Penn Station to the hotel (about 8 blocks). The location is about 14 blocks from Times Square, which we were able to walk quite easily. The outside of the hotel is beautiful with lovely potted plants. The heated entranceway was a nice greeting after being in the cold November air of New York City. Checking in at the front desk took all of 5 minutes. The complimentary bottled water was a nice touch. The front desk staff was so friendly. Their smiles and efficiency made us feel so welcomed. We paid a little extra to have a higher-level room. We were on the 20th floor with a nice view of the New York skyline. We could even see the Empire State building from our window. Our room was fashionably decorated with very modern furniture, electronics and fixtures. Even the wall-mounted TV screen had a personalized welcome screen with my name on it. The two double beds were very comfortable with clean and comfortable linen. The entire room was immaculate. The mini-fridge was stocked with goodies but we didn't touch them because we were on a budget, but they looked good. The bathroom was nicely tiled with granite countertop and clean, fluffy towels. The little extras, like cotton balls and Q-tips, was well-appreciated by my daughter who needs these items when applying and removing her make-up. When we realized that we forgot to pack toothpaste, we called room service. They were up in 5 minutes with individual packages of Colgate toothpaste. After ordering pizza and the smell of garlic lingered in the room. As we were stepping out we asked a random housekeeper who was cleaning another room to spray our room, she said, ""I'll take care of it."" Sure enough, when we got back to our room, it smelled like a field of flowers. The customer service at this hotel is the best I have ever encountered. We visited the roof-top lounge called ""The View"". What a joy that was. Many different sitting areas, all with a magnificent view of the Empire State building and the NY skyline. We had nice cocktails that the bartender recommended. They were a little pricey, at $14 each, but I guess that's about average in NYC. There weren't many guests at the lounge on a Sunday night, so the place was quiet and relaxing. There is also a restaurant in the lobby that is also very beautifully decorated, but we didn't eat there. We mostly ate at a Halal place right across the street. We also bought food at our favorite grocery store, Whole Foods, which was only one block away. After we had checked out, we had to wait in the lobby for about two hours for our ride. We sat in comfortable chairs right by the front desk. The staff continued to make us feel welcomed. They offered us cookies and bottled water. When we said our last good-byes to the staff, I felt a little sad. It was like leaving family. I definitely recommend this home away from home to anyone wanting a nice hotel experience in NYC.","Miami, United States","Dorothy J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, United States</strong>",1,5.0

The worst thing about this hotel is not only the very small room and that we booked a high floor and ended up looking onto some boilers and a laneway, it was that the front staff were not interested. They were must happier hiding at the back or chatting amongst themselves. This was not the work ethics I would expect from hotel staff, certainly not at this price range, as I have stayed at close to 30 different hotels around the world. The concierge was not there until 9am which was way later than when tourists would start their day. Nobody helped us with our bags and only on the last day of our 4 day stay were there anyone helping with taxis at the door. The deco was old and dated with a small lobby although clean. There were no free wifi and the fridge was locked unless taking something out which was more like a budget hotel. The only good thing going for it was the coffee machine and the bed. I would advise all to go past this hotel and don't waste your time.

I'm disappointed, especially in light of the fact that I paid well over $300 plus taxes for my small room and $55 per night for valet parking. $400++I stayed here ONLY because of location, having a business appointment nearby. It was very well situated for my purpose (great location for me) and easy to locate when driving through the Lincoln tunnel. The hotel seemed cramped and crowded with narrow hallways, narrow entry to room etc. considering I was paying FIVE STAR prices almost anywhere. The elevator was stuck/ didn't work immediately with the ""swipe"" from key cards about 3/4 of the time we went up. I heard this verbal complaint and watched the frustration from at least four different guests who were on the elevator with me. Also, several times guests on my elevator rode up for several minutes before realizing that they had to go all the way down and get ""swiped up"" in order to get up to the restaurant on the 22nd floor. There were repeated elevator issues which was annoying to say the least.My room seemed clean enough. Bed was fine. My room was quiet at night unlike some other Manhattan hotels- a big plus. I checked ""bed bug"" reports and there were quite a few but no recent ones so the hotel seems to have eradicated this problem. Recent updates of flat screen TV. Mini fridge. I used room safe with no problem. INTERNET CONNECTION WAS AWFUL. After serious frustration I switched to my cellular network on my iPad and STILL couldn't connect- ugh. Other minor gripes- hotel needed better lighting, very cheap artwork (tacky) in my 8th floor room.I often overlook the minor stuff and very very seldom leave a negative review of a property. In this case, however, my review is fully warranted. Now for my serious and dangerous gripe. I hope Hilton takes it seriously and immediately corrects it. During my early morning shower, the bathroom suddenly went PITCH BLACK. The first time this happened I was truly shocked -my heart stopped, I got shampoo in my eyes and I groped to open the shower door. I am not exaggerating. NO LIGHT at all. I was alarmed/ frightened thinking the whole hotel had blacked out. After taking a step or two outside the shower a sensor tripped the bathroom light back on. VERY ANNOYINGLY this happened THREE MORE TIMES during the course of a regular shower. Four times altogether. Once with a razor in my hand. Each time I had to stop, open the shower door and walk out or swing my arms wildly around until the sensor tripped the light on again. NEVER EVER has this happened to me before. I'm angry about it. I am a seasoned traveller and this ""green hotel"" money saving BULL is way beneath Hilton- especially when I'm paying $400 for a cramped room at the very end of the 8th floor hall with a very of boxes in a warehouse window. An older or more feeble guest could well have tripped or been severely injured during the bathroom blackout. Honestly.I later saw that there was a possibility to flip another switch in the bathroom that would possibly have left a small light on in the shower. THERE SHOULD BE CLEARLY WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS ON THE BATHROOM WALL EXPLAINING THIS if they decide to not address this problem by getting rid of this ridiculous flawed ""green"" lighting system. Oh, and a nice hotel should be updated to include ""fog free"" bathroom mirrors when I pay $400 bucks. Get your act together Hilton!

The neighborhood is an interesting mix of new and old, and it's walking distance to the High Line as well as Greenwich Village.

The only real criticism we walked away with was not being able to visit the rooftop bar/deck. The rooftop was one of the reasons we booked this location - however, we found not only is it off limits to anyone under 21 during prime bar hours after 5 PM (understandable), it is also completely off limits during the day, to everyone. In other words: non-guests who are 21 can walk in the front door and go to the roof any time after 5, but families with under-21 kids can NEVER go to the roof, night or day. This felt very unfair - though the staff who told us about this policy were nice about it.We would have been so thrilled if we had been allowed to go up to the room in the morning for coffee, or for lunch, etc. - but had to tell our four-year-old we weren't allowed.

It took 3 months, escalating to my bank and to a travel company to even come close to seeing a solution. Ultimately it took other BIG companies to get involved in order to get my money refunded.

The room was very clean with plenty of space. Not as big as some other hotel rooms but for NYC this was on the larger side, in my experience. We booked a ""high floor king"", which did have a view of the city although we were right about level with many roof top water tanks. For a one night stay, I'd not bother booking a ""high floor"" again as we didn't spend much time in the room anyway.We found the location convenient to several of the areas we wanted to visit, including Chelsea Market and The High Line. Both were in easy walking distance. A very short cab ride to Greenwich Village. The rooftop bar had a great view of city and a good crowd on Friday night. We just stopped in for a look and didn't stay for drinks. Breakfast was good and there was a choice of ordering from the menu or buffet. I would have no hesitation in returning to this Hilton property.","Valparaiso, Indiana","HoundDad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Valparaiso, Indiana</strong>",0,4.0

The ear plugs provided in the nightstands were helpful, as was cranking the A/C for white noise. A couple of tips: We were in a handicapped-accessible room, which I think provided extra space. Also, ask for a high floor and a room facing out onto 26th Street. Also, visit the rooftop bar if time permits.

I accept that. However, we were very let down by this hotel.We stayed for 7 nights over Christmas.Check-in was easy enough, and I was pleased to hear we'd been placed on the top floor. However, there was no offer to take our bags to our room. Normally we don't take staff up on it anyway, but after lugging them from Penn Station, it would have been nice.Upon arriving at the top floor, we were shocked and wondering if we were in the right place. There were mattresses against the walls - we could barely exit the lift. There was a desk in the hallway and there was an office chair pushed up against our room's door. Fire hazard much?!? We had to move the office chair - difficult given the hallways are narrow and were full with furniture already. We had to walk sideways and lift our heavy suitcases as the walkways were blocked and they couldn't be rolled normally.Once in the room, we called reception to ask what was going on - was this floor a storage floor? We weren't informed of the mess when we checked in, so were surprised when we arrived on the floor.Whomever we spoke to, didn't know what was going on, so put us through to someone else, who also didn't know. They then said they'd call back. We received the call back and were advised there were some renovations going on and they would be done by the evening. That's nice... How about telling guests on check in (and offering to help with the luggage if it is going to be difficult to manoeuvre). This was a very disappointing welcome to the Hilton fashion District.The room itself was small (we can live with that, it was expected) but it was so dark. It was lit by the bedside lights, two small lights on the walls, and a desk light. As the carpet and furniture was dark, the room remained the same. We were constantly loosing balck socks, scarves and beanies on the carpet - put it down and it would blend in and the light was not sufficient to be able to relocate it.Also, the airconditioning unit was so loud! Despite being December, the room became warm and stuffy and air didn't flow in the window well. We had to put the aircon unit on, but it sounded like a jet taking off. Trying to sleep with the noise was hard.The room was clean and neat, and the bathroom was nice - great shower.The other thing that surprised us was the unfriendly nature of the staff - everywhere else we stayed we were warmly welcomed by everyone we came across, be it the doorman or otherwise. Here, we never even got a smile from the doormen/security, despite saying hello/morning.The rooftop bar was nice (though it closed early a couple of times, so we were only able to visit once). Staff up there were attentive and friendly.We received a voice message on our room phone, as I have a Hilton rewards card (not with many points mind you) on the LAST day from the guest service manager, just checking if she could help with anything. This was a bit redundant.... We stayed at a Homewood by Hilton in Albany, and received the same call. However, it was within the first few hours of arriving and much more useful. An overall poor experience - you'll see from my previous reviews of places, I don't generally have a bad thing to say - but this time, I was disappointed. I'm sure there are other NYC hotels offering better service and value for money.","Perth, Australia","WorksOnly2Travel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",70,2.0

One! As I passed the lonely bottle to my friend, I reached out to the receptionist for another with both arms extended. After catching her eye again, she gave me only one more bottle leaving me to share a bottle with my other friend.Really?? Did we look as if we were not deserving of a bottle each?

That's just what you have when you turn the corner....Tried to take advantage of rooftop bar/dining when it didn't rain on Saturday or Memorial Weekend, but it was closed due to private party. A few blocks down at 23rd Street seems to get most of the subway lines, just depends on which train dictates which Ave. to catch it on. Taxis also easy to catch here as Holiday Inn and another hotel also on 26th. RARE dining for appetizers and desserts was good. Chelsea shopping and dining near though we did not stop by (but saw how close from the taxi taken on rainy evenings). Google map how close it is to other locales. My teenager daughter and I walked all the way up to Rockerfeller even with no issue. Loved loved passing thru Madison Square a couple times, sitting on bench with either view of Flatiron or Empire State bldg. Bike rental location just off Madison Square if you are into biking thru city.Area is more low-key (""less crowded"") than the Times Square area which is a plus!Room Quality:- trendy but simple decor, comfy & clean bed- standard room (for price I don't care), no view. It's NYC and a holiday weekend- rarely if ever did we hear neighboring rooms and based on door placement, we are likely very close in proximity- bathroom size decent and clean. Door to restroom just inches away from edge of the bed... that's how cozy room is.- closet is tiny, but enough to hold 8 -12 hangers. I travel 25% of year so I know how to pack clothing for multiple outfits- lobby staff... pretty bare but I'm going to NY to see the city and not be pampered by staff.

I began staying in this area as the Vamoose bus from DC starts about five minutes from my home and drops me off at 30th and Seventh Avenue, a two minute walk from this hotel. And, of course, this is a block or two from Penn Station, where I end up after taking the train should the bus not work. There are now a wide variety of bars and restaurants that serve local - expensively not this is NYC - so you do not need to take a taxi or subway or walk more than a few minutes for dinner or a drink. And given the proximity to the train and bus stops, you can save a bunch on taxis. I am focusing on this convenience because the hotel is just that, a hotel. Excellent service, it has a bar and breakfast and WiFi and so on. It appears to be newly renovated and was immaculate. Any downsides? The AC/heat turns on and off with some gusto, I wear earplugs on the road, you may want to take this into consideration. The room service and bar are ridiculously expensive compared to what you can walk to, as to be expected, and if you are expecting a room that is as big as the one you will get in some Tea Party state, forget it, this is New York.

For this visit, the location was perfect for a business trip and the other reviews helped make me comfortable with that choice. Room was comfortable and appeared to be clean and very well maintained. The room was not huge, but certainly would be considered on the larger side for a lot of Manhattan hotels where rooms tend to be pretty small on average. The prices for some on site options such as having to pay for in-room Wi-Fi access and the mini bar was a bit over the top. When you can get decent Wi-Fi free at many average hotels, there is just no reason for this any longer. However, this was countered with the excellent on site restaurant which featured pretty reasonable prices for the area. Getting into the elevator required your room card, which I found to be a major annoyance and headache since I was always carrying things in and out due to being there on business (laptop, papers etc). Add that they basically shut off access to one of the elevators to make it available for their rooftop bar patrons, it was pretty annoying when you just want to get back to your room after a long day.

The room was spacious, very clean and the view was excellent. We had a lovely view of the empire state building and the lights at night were amazing. Someone kindly brought up a complimentary bottle of champagne, a happy bday hat and a card for my boyfriend. A couple of minor cons were that one of the security guards looking after the lift to go to the rooftop was a bit of a jobsworth. Whilst we can understand that they don't want just anyone on the rooftop, he was a bit too dedicated towards policing the lift which was annoying at times as we just wanted to get our floor. Also, and this is down to individuals rather than the hotel, there was quite a bit of noise and someone tried to enter our room during the early hours of the first morning. I suspect these people were drunks navigating their way from the rooftop bar. Perhaps the security guard mentioned before could've better spent his time ensuring people got to their respective rooms or out of the building.

Had also booked a (very expensive) conference room for one day of in-hotel meetings. Hotel room on 22nd floor (top floor), room we well appointed, but pretty small - more in keeping with what I expect in Europe than the US. A bit too claustrophobic if traveling with someone else. However, it was one of the quietest NY rooms I've ever stayed in. When the window was closed the sound of the city was literally blocked. I've grown used to hearing sirens all night in NY, but that was not the case at the Hilton. Room was kept immaculate by very dedicated housekeeping staff. Elevator requires room key to be swiped in order to get to your room, so you can only get to the floor you're room is on. This is a nice added security feature, but can be a bit annoying when your hands are full and you just want the elevator to take you up (and not have to fumble for your key to get it to operate). I appreciated the security, but it made me wonder if the area required this extra step. Hotel is close to Fashion Institute of Technology, area is quirky, but there is a great Italian place (Tre Dici) that hotel recommended for dinner that was great (and just a few doors down from hotel). Attendant assigned as food/beverage liason for conference room was the best (thanks George!), he was very attentive and helped me and my guests with all our requests.

Therefore, we accumulate a large number of Hilton points that come in handy for family vacations. We stayed at Fashion District Hilton for a short family trip to NYC, which included my husband and myself, our daughter, and my 98-year-old father. We had reserved three rooms for two nights - with one of them being a handicapped room (for my father). Although he is not disabled, we had discovered during previous trips that not all hotels have grab bars in the bathtubs; therefore we wanted to be sure my father would be safe. When we arrived at the hotel around 2:00 pm, we were told that our rooms were not ready; so we went downstairs to the restaurant for a snack. When we returned to the front desk at 4:00, we were told that two of the rooms were ready but that the handicapped room would not be ready until 7:00 p.m. as the guest in the room was ill and we would ""have to wait."" That was completely unacceptable. Whether or not one is a Hilton Diamond member or just a first-time guest, the rooms are supposed to be ready for occupancy by no later than 4:00 p.m. This was especially important for my 98-year-old father, as he was tired and wanted to rest. If that particular handicapped room was not available, then other arrangements should have been made; but the staff at the front desk did not even try to accommodate us. My 98-year-old father had to wait another three hours for a room; and when we complained, the young woman at the front desk raised her voice to us and did not even apologize for the delay. She just said ""I told you that you would have to wait."" Well,she certainly did not have the authority to make that decision and in my opinion should have been fired. To make matters worse, our room was at the end of the hall and the staff kept banging doors all night; and we ordered room service and were overcharged. The restaurant was down a steep flight of steps and had a very limited menu and poor service. My husband eventually spoke to the manager and we had all of the points used for my father's room refunded to us. We found the ultra-modern decor to be uncomfortable and unfriendly, and I would never stay there again. This location might be OK for college students and young couples, but it's not family friendly at all.

Since I would be using HHonors points for my stay, I wanted to make sure it would be worth it. There are obviously numerous Hilton family properties in and around NYC and the better the location in Manhattan, the more points (or dollars) the property costs. The positives: the hotel is new and as such the quality of rooms, bathrooms, furniture, etc. is excellent. The service was also top notch; I received a welcome e-mail from a real, live guest-services coordinator (perhaps because of my Hilton Gold status), but still a welcome gesture. Front desk staff, bellman, and breakfast buffet staff were all courteous, prompt, and pleasant. The location of the hotel is a plus -just three blocks from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, two blocks from a subway stop. Midtown by definition is a central place to be in NYC since you're between the financial district and the Central Park area, and this hotel is good for that. The only negative is that the rooms, even the upgraded on I had, are very small. But most hotels in NYC have small rooms, and who spends a lot of time in their room anyway in New York? I did utilize the breakfast buffet, which was complimentary with my stay, but not sure if I would pay for that. Did not check out the roof top bar, but it definitely seemed popular.

When I asked the lady at the desk about changing rooms, she said to come back in the morning, she thought there would be an opening on the 22nd floor. But when I asked the next day there was a different woman was at the desk; and she said that because I had booked the room through a discount website, I could not switch rooms. There is no lobby to speak of--it is mostly a restaurant. There are two computers tucked away for guests use--that was great. There are only two chairs and some padded benches for guests to hang out in--although I think that was mostly for the patrons of the restaurant. It was not a lobby that one would spend any time hanging out in, as it was cold and uncomfortable. The roof top lounge and restaurant is only for adults, we had teens and they were not allowed to go there, even just to see the view. Saturday night is a big bar night, they have a bouncer with a walki-talki manning the elevator that goes to the roof top. The trendy restaurant is packed and there is a line for the lounge.

The beds were very comfortable, the roof was clean if not too roomy with 2 queens and 2 sets of luggage. The closet was extremely small, almost useless (a hotel in Paris's was bigger if that tells you anything). And with 2 women in the room a real problem. The bathroom was quite nice. However we had a couple of major issues here which I have to be resolved with the hotel. The first and most important is we asked for and got a special refrigerator to store very expensive medication for my guest. The problem was one night when we got back from our outings, we discovered the fridge was open, and turned off and her medication bag (a ziplock) had been opened. also the carpet was dirty, and obviously not vacuumed. Otherwise it was fine and things made up. Nothing seemed to have been removed from the fridge, but because the medicine was warmed to room temperature it was unusable and regarded unsafe. It takes a while with this stuff to notice how you feel when you miss a dose (or 2 or 3 in my friend's case), and she now does not feel well at all. She's back home in another country now. No one ever told us even tho we asked several times who was responsible for doing this or discussed it with us again before we left. We were in such a rush to make it to the airport with President Obama having just arrived and snarling traffic, I didn't have time to get into it again with the front desk staff who honestly were not that helpful the first time. I would still like an answer and some compensation for my friend's ruined medication. The other issue was a concierge member, whose name I will not mention booked a cruise for us off Chelsea Pier which took ages to accomplish with me standing right there, all over the phone and taking my credit card, etc, which we discovered after a $13 taxi down to the pier did not exist. The ship had been out of commission for 2 weeks. Since the person the concierge booked the tour with is in Brooklyn, I would assume she would know that. so all that time lost. It took at least another hour later with another concierge member who had no idea who the other person was (what is that about? you don't know your coworkers?) to straighten it out, another lost almost half a day. Supposedly I will get my card refunded. It was just all avoidable and no compensation for the incredible inconvenience not to mention embarrassment on my part as I was acting as host. So there were things I liked fine about the place, but those 2 issues will probably prevent me from staying there again even if I am not traveling with my friend with the medication issues. I picked this hotel not only because of the location but because of the great reviews of the staff. Some were quite nice, but overall the staff experience was spotty and unprofessional and could use major coordination and improvement to make a seamless customer service experience. When there is a serious concern as in our case, I do not want to be ""handled"" by the staff, I need answers and assistance.","Scottsdale, Arizona","glamormom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scottsdale, Arizona</strong>",29,3.0

First it was the cordless phone that that didn't work. Thanks however to assistance from the hotel techie the phone was exchanged, only to discover that the Wi-Fi hook up through the hotel's solution with AT&T was playing up too. The techie was thankfully quick in resolving this problem by hooking us up to the hotel's Wi-Fi instead at no cost for us (Hilton otherwise still charges for this ""luxury""). The next obstacle proved itself to be the cold weather in New York and I were surprised how poorly our hotel room seemed to be equipped for it. The entire window frame and insulation went into deep freeze mode. The ice cold draft along the floor made it impossible to keep my feet from freezing whilst sitting at the desk, working with the follow day's presentation. Later, the need to choose between ""heating on"", which meant an option of either noisy hot air ""conditioner"" keeping us awake, or ""heating off"" which is usually offers a comfortable sleeping temperature, made that night's sleep less than good.It's possible this hotel is better suited for milder days, but on colder days there are probably better choices.","Stockholm, Sweden","Tord E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",115,3.0

I like to have a drink when I get back to my hotel after a long day so having to wait 10-15 minutes for ice to be brought up is a bit frustrating.I’m usually a Starwood guy, but thought I would try this Hilton as it is a block from the office I work at. I do have gold status with Hilton which advertises late checkout which I assumed was 4pm like Starwood, but that’s not the case. When I went to confirm late check out with the front desk, the lady told me “I can give you until 1pm”. I told her I thought it was 4pm and she just chuckled and laughed at me.

I got a killer Cowboy Ribeye from the restaurant in the lobby Rare.If the price point is competitive or significantly lower than the Sheraton around the corner I will stay here again, otherwise I’ll go where I can get a 4pm checkout so I don’t have to schlep my luggage to the office before I head to the airport.","Los Angeles, California","lindseybreeden</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",43,3.0

Front desk staff were friendly and efficient upon arrival and throughout my stay, which I did really appreciate. My issues began when I got to my room. Upon unpacking my clothing into the dresser (I was staying for a week), I found a previous guest's vibrator. Yes, I typed that correctly. There was a vibrator in the dresser drawer! So gross! I found a hair in my bed sheets as well, which I rarely get upset about, but after the lack of dresser drawer cleaning, it was hard not to be overly sensitive about finding other cleaning mistakes.I ordered room service on my first night, which was good, but then no one came to pick up my try. It was still in the hall the following morning, and I saw this during my entire stay with dirty room service trays and dishes all over the hallways for hours and hours. Only until housekeeping came for their rounds did anything get picked up. Unacceptable.Then, to cap off my stay, when I was checking out I requested the bell staff get me a cab. They said no, that I could just hail my own. So, I stepped out onto the curb in the freezing cold and tried hailing a cab for over 10 minutes with no luck since very few cabs came down the street. Cold and frustrated, I headed back inside to ask again and they finally helped. Of course, once the cab arrived, bell staff didn't help with my bags.While I certainly don't expect Hilton to be a 5-star experience, the lack of cleanliness, lack of attention to detail and lack of service were a big miss for me. The hotel offers good rates and rooms are nice and new, but I'd rather pay more to ensure my room is appropriately cleaned and that I get better service.","Nashville, Tennessee","Christina V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>",13,2.0

Very accessible subway stops 2-3 blocks in almost every direction.Loved my walk to the hotel through the floral shops that had their plants and flowers all out on the sidewalk. It felt like spring in January.Check-in was a bit slow. There were four people standing behind the desk but only two were actually working/helping others guests out. The attendant was pleasant and straightforward, offering an amenity bag for Gold/Diamond members that included 2 bottles of water and a mixed nut snack pack which were definitely appreciated.Room was on the smaller side of what I've experienced in the City but not too bad. Would say room was more akin to a Hampton Inn or DoubleTree... didn't quite have the luxury feel that it's touted to have but above all it was clean. The fire escape plan/map behind the door still had the Wyndham Fashion26 logo on it and looking up pics from it's old self, the hotel decor didn't change much if anything at all.Breakfast buffet was one of the better spreads for a Hilton in the city with lots and lots of options which I thoroughly enjoyed as part of my Diamond benefit. Unfortunately the rooftop bar closed early at 12midnight so didn't get a chance to check it out.Overall, the room served it's purpose of offering a comfy bed and restful night's sleep. Some traffic noise audible but they supply earplugs. Even as a reincarnated hotel, the hotel still seemed fresh and clean. The management staff seems to be pretty proactive in making sure guests have a positive experience which is nice. Given the opportunity and the right price point again, I would definitely consider this property on my next weekend jaunt in the city.","Honolulu, Hawaii","J_Carino</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",6,4.0

I had a beautiful view of the Empire State Building and the room was very quiet. The front desk staff was pleasant and efficient and came through with a good restaurant choice on the same block. I stopped in the lounge in the lobby ""Rare"" after dinner and found it to be a pleasant place to relax...a glass of wine pretty standard and reasonably priced for bar wine and nice atmosphere. I was exceptionally impressed with the bartender, Sarah, who was friendly and warm, and most importantly, it seemed quite genuine as she obviously enjoyed her job and pleasant/thoughtful conversations with customers...an unusual find in any hotel lounge, but particularly in Manhattan as it wasn't the standard ""I guess I have to talk to you"" mode. The rate was more than reasonable for the location and the quality. Only downside was the parking garage the hotel recommends as the service when getting my car back in the morning was (exceptionally) slow and grumpy...if you are going to charge big time prices you should provide service with a good work ethic (but no reflection on the hotel staff who were fine).

The hotel also has a bar & restaurant on the ground floor which are great too. My only criticism would be that the rooftop bar is not open long enough we only visited once as every other time it was either closed or being used for a function. In terms of location the location is great you are within walking distance of Times Square & plenty of underground stops. It's a great place to stay in New York.

I really liked the shampoo/conditioner/lotion combo and appreciated the Keurig (although why is it that they mostly give decaf in NY?) The TV is pretty cool- you turn it on and you're greeted by your name (written). You can also check out via TV, which is a first for me. Location is great- it's less than a 10 min walk to Penn Station! No need to take a taxi if you're taking the Amtrak. I asked for a higher floor since I had issues with street level noise the last time I was in NY and slept pretty well the entire week. I was at the very back of the hotel (on the south side) and it worked really well for me. Wish I had been able to visit the rooftop bar but it was closed when I was staying there. Apparently it's not open unless it's around 40 degrees or higher. Complaints:1) Elevators (technology): you're required to swipe your room key and then press your button, which is great for security but sometimes leads to frustration when the technology doesn't want to pick up whatever signal from your room key. One time, I actually just pressed for the Lobby and the elevator randomly stopped. Weird.2) Elevators (availability): there was one morning where only one of the four elevators was working for 21 floors, which meant that there was a ridiculously long wait (5+ minutes!) I waited to go downstairs, discovered I had forgotten my gloves, had to go back upstairs and then come back down. It took way longer than it should have, and I really hope that the hotel management keeps the elevator maintenance to when fewer people are trying to get to work/business/etc. 3) Shower floor: kinda looked outdated and a little bit gross to me. It didn't match at all to the rest of the room. 4) Internet!! Seeing the price of internet ($15/DEVICE/day) was like a stab to the heart (over-dramatic, yes, but you have no idea how happy I was connecting to the slow Amtrak wifi). Maybe I'm too used to free internet, but even so, I've never seen an internet that was charged per device. In this day and age, a lot of people have multiple devices so this really sucked. Alternative: the Argo Tea right at the corner of 26th St & 7th Ave offers 2 hours of free wifi with purchase, and closes at 11pm. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay but that price tag on the internet is my biggest deterrent. I've stayed at a Hampton Inn further uptown on 43rd St, and I'd honestly rather stay there for the free internet even though this Hilton is so much nicer.

Thinking that there would be no additional charges when I haven't used anything - no F&B and not even the toiletries/amenities of the hotel. Except for the Keurig capsules for the in-room coffee maker. The billing showed up that there was a mini-bar charge. Of what? Apparently, even if you dare to open the 'auto-dispenser' fridge in the room, it will 'automatically' run through an electronic system to post an item to your guest account. That's what the front desk agent claimed to be the system of the hotel.So advanced in hotel rooms now these days that even the mini-bar is like an auto vending machine. Wow! I'm impressed. I've debated with the agent that I didn't consume any of the mini-bar items. Where she could personally go into the room and do a final inventory count in person. Or either have housekeeping to do the refill of mini-bar if I had consumed the items daily - not to mention that there was no housekeeping service of the room the day prior to checkout. The front desk agent says: ""Oh, it's an automatic system and that housekeeping has no access to the mini-bar..."" Something along those lines. So, who the hell does? The F&B outlets of the hotel? The manager? The front desk? Who the hell knows...Luckily, that the agent says that the charge will be removed after a heated discussion with other hotel guests next to me at the reception.I furthered to complain with the agent that if the hotel can randomly post lines of 'mini-bar' without addressing what particular item it is of the mini-bar, you might as well please update the printed material that shows the prices of mini-bar. Because, there's no M&M's or Cashew to be found in the room. Well, at least not in my room. By the way, 'cashew' should be plural with 's'. I guess one single cashew costs $7.50.Other amazing interior (design) features of this hotel:- The carpet color is dark as a cave. Great to camouflage certain stains from wear and tear. However, as years go by - good luck figuring how clean or not the carpet is. I'd rather not taking my socks or shoes off in the room when this hotel is aged.- The shower stall is fitted with a standard shower head on a shower stall that's big enough to have a party. The shower head has no way of spraying the entire surface area of the stall. There's no handheld shower head/faucet. I'm curious how often does housekeeping clean the entire stall with diluted chlorine detergent/disinfectant? When a hotel room is high volume traffic of changing guests every so often, without a handheld shower head/faucet, how clean is the shower stall? I guess housekeeping staff brings in a bucket with a scrub every so often to do cleaning.- The bathroom lighting is like I went back to my office space. The hanging energy-saving/fluorescent tube track lighting. I suppose that's fine if you don't consider a possible hazard for guests that if one of the hanging wires fails and drops into a sink full of water. Maybe liability issues are at hand. To further with the height of the basin - don't even bother to use the sink if you have a toddler or child in the room. It's way above the standard height of a sink.Commercial grade type of design and planning is VERY different from your own home. It has a lot of other factors to consider other than: ""Oh, it looks great in residential homes, why not just slap it on to commercial use."" Functionality, ease of operation, durability, maintenance schedule, handicapped/disabled access - amongst the few that are crucial in the planning/construction phases of commercial buildings.","New York City, New York","Arnold W M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",13,2.0

For the cost, the room size could be a little bigger but that's NY. We did not eat at the restaurant, so dont know too much about it. Front desk seem to be helpful and professional. The Bell men also seem to be helpful. Overall, location is convenient you can walk to the Empire State building. Parking, well you know the answer there, no parking. The hotel website said their was parking for $25 down the street, that is not true, I think that info is outdated. You can find parking on 25th, ( I forgot the name but they watch your car all night 24/7 but you can not take your car out or you will be charged again or maybe not get a spot-we just left the car there) what NY does have is transportation, which is the best in the world. You have to appreciate this about the city. I believe, we found a place for $30 a day but it had no relationship with the hotel. It was cheaper than what the Bellman's recommended, but I dont fault them for that, again parking---that is NY. I think you could find a more reasonable hotel around that area at a discount price, if you look good enough. One last thing, the fitness center ok as well, not like Wow, but clean and bottle water inside with towels. I seem better ones with a lesser hotel rate, at various other Hilton's and non-Hiltons.","Fort Mill, South Carolina","Michael G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Mill, South Carolina</strong>",0,3.0

It almost felt like a boutique hotel; it had a smaller lobby and you can practically walk into an elevator once you walk in. There is a restaurant by the name of RARE to the right of the entrance. It was always busy, but I never actually went into the restaurant/bar. I did order room service twice and it was pretty darn quick and very tasty.My room was great, I was facing another building which wasn't a big deal because it was very quiet (7th floor). I forgot to ask for down alternative pillows and paid for it the first two nights, but I left a note for housekeeping and came back to find new pillows and I think a new comforter. Score! There is a Whole Foods on the corner of 25th and 6 which was great for having water and fruit in the room. Madison Square Garden is practically across the street with Macy's a few blocks down and great, great, great shopping on 5th. I kept seeing the Empire State Building when I looked up and it looked pretty close. I think the hotel could use some updating, specifically the carpets and that ottoman thingy. Also, the desk staff was not the friendliest. Sure, they were polite and went thru the motions, but not one of them ever cracked a smile. Like not once. The housekeeping staff that I would run into in the hallway or elevators were totally friendly and warm. They could not have been nicer. I think the front desk staff could use some friendly advice from them. At the end of the day, it wasn't a big deal.

From the front desk to housekeeping to the bar to room service and everyone in between, the entire hotel staff aimed to please and succeeded. I spoke with the manager (whose name escapes me at the moment) and extended my appreciation to her when I left. From talking to her, you could really get a sense of why the people working at this place took pride in their jobs and that the positive attitude went from the bottom to the top of the hierarchy. The rooftop bar has an awesome view, although the wine selection at that bar is pretty abysmal, considering it's more of a beer and burger type place. The lobby bar is a bit more posh (with a ridiculously good looking bartender). The location is really central to a lot of big NYC attractions, considering that it's within walking distance to mostly every midtown attraction. Plus, being in the middle of Fashion Avenue near two of the biggest design schools, you're sure to see some interesting outfits on the students wandering about the neighborhood.

More positively, pricing appears competitive;the employees are friendly; the doormen are efficient (not so much the rather dopey concierge who thought it would take 1.5 hours to get to JFK early on a Sunday by limo); and the restaurant for breakfast at c. $22 for the buffet is good value and has reasonable choice.

The hotel is conveniently placed a short distance from Penn Station, it is modern, clean, and reasonably priced. However, that's where the compliments end, despite having plentiful staff on the reception desk only a few were dealing with customers (the remainder were chatting). The staff at reception and on the door were not very approachable, and in fact seemed quite arrogant and pretentious! Personally, I was dismayed at this fact as having stayed in other Hilton's the staff are normally friendly, attentive, and approachable; I often stay at Hilton's throughout Europe in business. It's quite shocking that the staff we encountered were more interested in the tip they'd receive than the job itself! I am aware that tipping is customary is the United States, but I personally feel that a good level of service should be provided in order to merit such tips.Except from the staff, the only other disappointment with the hotel was that the ""roof-top"" bar was not available to myself and friends on the 3 occasions we desired entry. The reason for this is that it was booked for private parties! Surely the primary use of the bar should be for the hotel guests!Previous trips to the the United States have been shown that hotels (and staff) are very welcoming and accommodating. I will be visiting NYC again, I will stay in other Hilton's, but I will not be visiting this hilton again.P.s. I normally read trip advisor reviews on hotels etc, but don't post. However, a recent trip to Thailand and the fantastic levels of service received has compelled me to create a profile and give credit to some of the great places I've stayed and visited..... This has also prompted me to post a review on this hotel; recent stays in the Glasgow Hilton (UK), and the Den Hague Hilton (NL) have reflected how bad the the fashion District NYC experience actually was!","Playa de Fanabe, Spain","jamesmD3873IX</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Playa de Fanabe, Spain</strong>",13,3.0

The 1 subway is only a couple blocks away and will take you to times square or the 8th street subway is close by as well. The weather was nice this weekend and I enjoy walking anyway and it is only about a 15 minute walk to the theaters depending on how congested the sidewalks are once you hit 42nd. The wife always likes to go to Macy's and I always like to shop at B&H everytime we are in NYC and it's convenient to both those stores. Also a great location for events at MSG.We prefer to use Newark Airport and it's only about a 10 minute walk to Penn Station and $12.50 a person to take the train to EWR.Plenty of restaurants on 7th to eat at and rare is very good as well.No suites, so the only upgrade is to a higher floor if you are diamond. Rooms are kind of small, but I guess average for NYC, and the furnishings are new and pretty modern. I like the Kcup coffee makers. Welcome bag with the water and chocolate covered raisins was nice at checkin and they recognized my diamond status which I always find nice.For HH-Diamonds you have a choice of a hot buffet or a variety of hot items off a special menu. I did the black forest crossaint one day and my wife did the eggs benedict that same morning and both were great. We both did the buffet the other morning. Not sure of the breakfast benefit for golds.My only real complaint was the elevators. They have three elevators that service all the guest floors and when the rooftop bar is open they take one of those out of service to use strictly for the bar. The one day we were there, some elevator problem happened and the elevator was stuck on a floor and unusable. That night, it meant only one elevator was usable since the other one was being used for the bar which caused a long wait.The room was pretty noisy and lots of street noise at night but we were facing the street.

We usually stay at the W in Union Square, but they were considerably more expensive for the weekend we chose, and were not running any specials. The Hilton rooms are definitely smaller, but you don't come to NYC to sit in the room. The amenities at the Hilton were comparable to the W, and the rooftop bar was lots of fun!Rooms: on the small side, but temperature control was responsive. Even on the 12th floor, you could hear the street noise, but hey, it's NYC. We could see into the windows of the FIT fashion students' classroom windows, which was cool. The bathroom was nice, tho the shower was one where you had to reach your head and shoulders in to turn on, so you got a blast of cold water before every shower, and the water pressure was low, but nothing that would be a deterrent from staying here again. Bars: Rooftop bar has great views and was fun, and is heated in the cooler weather. But it has the feel of a sports bar, since that is what's playing on the screens, and the alcohol choices are severely limited. (Nothing frozen, no blenders, etc.) Still, it was worth the view. The Rare (restaurant) bar in the lobby was fun, not too crowded when we were there and a nice atmosphere. Check in was super quick and check out is a breeze. Standard 11am TV-turnoff on day of check out, but that happens everywhere. Kureg machines in the room, iPod dock alarm clock, even a small closet.

We stayed for 4 nights from the 29th of December - 2 January. The hotel and lobby area are very funky and really fit the vibe of the 'fashion district'. The decor was much newer and fresher looking than the Sheraton on Canal that we had spent the previous 5 nights at. The room was compact but that is to be expected in NYC and although it wasn't huge it was more than ample considering the amount of time we spent in the room.Location is good with only a 2 block walk to the next subway line. There were some good cafes and a whole foods within walking distance which was handy. My only complaint, and it may seem petty, was that when you order room service to your room, you are charged a delivery fee of about $3! On one of the days I got a salad for lunch from whole foods and didn't pick up a fork so I asked room service for one, when I was told about the fee I asked if I could just come and get the fork but was told the kitchen was on level 3 or something, which is off limit to guests. Another day we had thick shakes from the room service menu and same fee again. Seems so silly when you can order food from a local place that is usually cheaper food and they don't charge you a delivery fee! To add to the stupidity - when your food order from outside arrives some one from the concierge has to escort the delivery guy up to your room as the elevators are key access only!! What a waste of your staffers time. I just thought it was a bit ridiculous considering we were already paying a premium of about $400 a night for the room over this time of year.Don't get me wrong in that this wouldn't sway my decision to return to this hotel as I absolutely would - just a bit of feedback on the overall experience.

We redeemed Hilton HHonors points for a free night's stay. The hotel is located in the midtown area (in the Garment District), near Madison Square Garden/Penn Station, so it is a good location for Times Square sightseeing, and offers convenient access to various subway lines, bars, restaurants, and souvenir shops. The lobby area itself is not large, although it offers a few places for guests to sit and chat. The décor fits the theme of a Fashion District hotel, with spools of thread composing an interesting art piece behind the front desk, which has space for three agents to check guests in (one agent is reserved for Hhonors check-ins). A tiny concierge/tour desk is located adjacent to the front door. RARE Bar & Grill is located at one end of the lobby, where breakfast is served (complimentary for Hhonors Gold and Diamond members; however, we did not partake of breakfast). The hotel also features the RARE rooftop bar and lounge, although we did not visit that either. In the evenings, one elevator is dedicated to whisking patrons from the lobby to the 23rd floor rooftop. Two additional elevators access guestrooms on the 2nd to 22nd floors. The hotel offers valet and self-parking for an additional fee, and the garage is located just a few yards from the hotel entrance. Taxi cabs were plentiful in front of the hotel. We had a corner room on the 22nd floor with a great view of the Empire State Building. The room was average size for New York City, with a king-size bed abutted by two nightstands, a desk/dresser/bureau combination, small ottoman/seat that could be moved around, and a shelving unit that housed the glass-fronted minibar (do not move anything or you will be charged) and coffee-making supplies, and a small closet that contained an electronic safe, iron, and ironing board. The room décor was modern and appealing, and the fashion theme (or sewing theme) carried through on some of the artwork. The bathroom was a decent size, with a combination tub/shower unit and large countertop vanity with a single sink. The light fixture is super modern and just a little dangerous, in our opinion. It is a long thin tube light that projects just a little too far from the wall for our comfort because it can be confused for a pipe. Peter Thomas Roth toiletries were provided - two kinds of soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and mouthwash, as well as Q-tips and cotton balls. Three sets of towels were provided, despite the fact that the room could really only sleep two guests. (We have found only two sets of towels in most Hilton properties that we have recently stayed, so the third set was a welcome site.) The hotel does not offer turndown service, nor does it offer vending or ice machines; however, we called down to the front desk several times to request ice delivery, and it was done quickly, complimentarily, and with a smile. We would not hesitate to stay here again, although there are three other Hilton properties within a few blocks of this one (Doubletree, Hampton Inn, and Hilton Garden Inn), so those are valid options as well if you are loyal to Hilton.",Pennsylvania,"fluffnfold</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pennsylvania</strong>",920,4.0

One of the employees was standing behind a computer so I walked up to her and started checking in (so I thought). She had this puzzled look on her face and asked me, “Check in?” Then she pointed to another line, “Over there.” I asked if this counter was for gold/diamond members only because there was an HHonors sign on the counter (and I’m a gold member). She replied loudly and slowly, “WE HAVE THE HHONORS SIGN BECAUSE WE ARE A HILTON HOTEL.” I don’t know where all that attitude came from and apparently this hotel doesn’t have a separate line for gold/diamond members.We booked a “high floor” room through a third-party website who told me “high floor” meant 15th floor or higher. Hilton’s own website says high floor rooms “have magnificent views of New York City's iconic buildings…” Our room was on the 14th floor and had a view of couple dozen windows across the street. When I called the front desk, I was told 12th floor and above were considered “high floor” and I was misinformed by the third-party website. So, if you decide to spend a little extra on a “high floor” room for “magnificent views of New York City's iconic buildings”, there’s a chance the best they can offer you is the windows across the street.

Our trip to NYC was 9 days in total, so comfort, great service and ease is what we were looking for in a hotel. Unfortunately, this is not what we found at the Hilton Fashion District. Not only were the lifts small in size, the room to accomodate for 3 girls, was smaller than my bedroom at home -- as soon as we stepped in the door I started feeling so costraphobic, not only was it small it was SO stuffy. To be quite open, I couldn't even go to the bathroom without having to keep the bathroom door open - how uncomforting! We explained this to the front office staff who were completely unempathetic and would not move us to a different room. We spent out first night in NYC looking up alternate hotels to stay in and checked out of this hotel the following morning and found a much more accomodating hotel (The Refinery - amazing!).However, unfortunately this was not the end of our dealings with Hilton. After a few days into our NYC trip, we noticed on our travel card statements that the hilton was taking money from our accounts, one of the multiple transactions was over $2000!!!!!!!!! Being on a budget holiday and in an expensive city, this was the most stressful thing that could have happened and we spent our only Saturday evening (until 9pm) at the Hilton reception, arguing back and forth why Hilton STOLE money from our account without any authorization. After 4 hours, FINALLY we came to an agreement that the Hilton would get the money back into all of our accounts - and we were still not given an explanation as to why the money was even taken out. The service at the front desk was APPALLING, unempathetic and so unprofessional. Staying at this hotel is not a risk you would want to take in terms of keeping your money safe when passing on credit card details. I will never be staying in a Hilton Hotel again & have issued a formal complaint to head office regarding this particular matter. For all travellers out there, I recommend not staying at this hotel for the comfort of your holiday, the security of your money and your dealings with supposed 'service'.","Sydney, Australia","Louise B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",5,1.0

Two subways lines, PENN station and the PATH is within walking distance. If you are coming from JFK I would suggest you get the LIRR (Long Island Rail Road) from Jamaica to Penn station and walk from there. Its a lot easier than getting the subway into Manhattan. The room was very cosy and a bit on the small side, the bathroom was very nice and modern with a fantastic shower, but no bath. We paid a little bit more for a high floor, and then requested an Empire State view. If this is important to you, then its worth the upgrade, but if not, then the view from the rooftop bar should suffice you. There was a great bedside alarm clock with an iPod/iPhone dock, but be warned, this isn't the latest small apple connector, its the old one. If you have a newer iPhone or iPod then bring an adapter. The TV was great, mostly HD but unfortunately, it was all local channels. For a large international chain like Hilton I would have liked to see CNN International, BBC World or similar. The wardrobe has a large free space, which I believe could fit most small to medium laptops.There are a few downsides to this hotel. There are 4 lifts, but one is reserved for the gym and in the evenings the 4th is reserved for the rooftop bar. This means there is a lot of traffic for just two lifts and they can take a long time to come, before making many stops en route. The lobby is not very inviting, and the staff are dressed very hip with caps and shirts. This makes the place feel more like the lobby of a nightclub and doesn't give a warm or inviting feel.The Wi-Fi is very expensive, and these days internet access is more of a need than a luxury. If the fee was per room this would have been more agreeable, but at $14 a device it becomes a large expense. There is free Wi-Fi in the lobby, but this stopped being offered after the 5th day.The coffee machine is great to have, but we were given very limited pods, only enough for 2 a day, it also could do with being plumbed in as every cup made requires a single cup of water pouring into it. Hanging space was very limited, and with a bit more thought in the room another wardrobe could have been provided. Also, there wasn't anywhere to store empty cases.If you are looking for somewhere to go for breakfast there is a fantastic American diner nearby which was excellent. Really well priced, great food, great service and very popular with the locals, called Johny's Luncheonette. Look it up on here and make yourself a regular!I’m sure there are many many worse places to stay, but for the money, I think I could have done better elsewhere.

This is frustrating if you are staying in the hotel as you can have a wait for the lift in the evenings and when it does come you end up having to stop at a few floors if you, like us, stay on a higher floor. They charge for rooms on higher floors due to the view. The view of Empire States is nice, but the rest of the view isnt of anything and I would suggest not paying for this and looking at the view from the roof top bar.The roof top bar can also be noisy. On my first night there I had to use sleeping tablets due to the banging noise. This went on past 2am, and is unfair on guests who have paid a fair bit of money to stay there.The rooms are small. They are also poorly laid out and more thought should have gone into this. The main part of the room is taken by the bed as you would expect and in ours a large air con system was on the floor. This should have been on the wall to increase space. There was a long desk at the other side of the room from the bed, which was way too big and some of this space should have been used to provide extra hanging space.As you walk in the room there is a wardrobe, this is tiny giving enough space to have 7-10 items, which for 2 people for a week isnt enough. The bathroom isnt a bad size, but again is poorly laid out. The room could have been better designed to fit a bath, but this hasnt been done so there is just a large shower area, it does have to be said the shower was nice. The light into the bathroom is on a movement sensor which is great when going in, but even with the door closed light does leak into the bedroom at night when trying to get to sleep.The room had a coffee pod machine. This needed water putting in it and for the cost of the hotel room I would have expected this to have been plumbed in. They never left enough pods despite us asking on the second day for more to be left.The bed is pretty comfy (Nowhere as near as good as a Marriott bed) but the pillows poor.The hotel offers free wifi in reception for guests. This only seemed to work for 5 days before they wanted us to pay. The cost is way too high for a service I need all the time and consider esential. The cost was $14 per day per device. If it was $14 per room per day this wouldnt have been as bad. I did find if logged into the free wifi it would still work in the room.This hotel is aimed at couples, business users and young single people. I would not recomend to families.Im pretty sure there are better hotels in NYC for the same money and would look around before booking. This isnt somewhere I would book again.",,21mapple,78,3.0

The rooms were neat and clean and always stocked with enough ""supplies"" so you didn't have to hunt a maid down and get stuff. At one point my husband's toothbrush BROKE and the front desk just gave us one at N/C.It is a 2 block walk to the subway - which makes it very convenient to get anywhere you need to in the city. It was a little more difficult hailing a taxi from this location. In fact, the day we were leaving for the airport we had to take a Hotel car because the taxi's were not coming down this street.They have a rooftop bar which is very nice and relaxing. The price of the drinks are lower than most other bars in the city and they were GOOD. They had a DJ playing there on Saturday evening so you may have to wait in line a bit on a night they have entertainment.I am a Diamond Member with Hilton so I am used to a lot of incentives to stay at their properties. The only upgrade was to a higher floor. The room was SO small that basically the bed fit in it and that is about it. The closet was so small that my dresses hit the safe that was also located in the closet. Usually, I get access to club lounges but they don't have on at this property so don't expect anything like that. I also get vouchers for breakfast - which they give us - however, at other Hiltons, you usually have access to an enormous spread of ""continental"" delights OR you can put that money towards anything on their menu. The first thing they ask when you enter the restaurant is ""do you have a voucher?"" - then they hand you a menu or tell you to choose from the small buffet. I finally asked if there was a different menu for those without vouchers and she said ""yes."" I didn't care for this at all. But, like I said - staff was awesome, food was ""ok"" and atmosphere was nice.IF you want to stay in the Chelsea area, then this may be a good spot for you.

Last summer my daughter and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn on 26th (2 blocks away from this location). We loved it and booked our recent trip there as well. But the price had gone up $190 a night from our previous stay in Aug. I belong to the Playbill Club and received an email about a discount available for the Hilton New York Fashion District at a considerable savings. So I promptly moved our reservation. We saved about $270 staying at this location.Now on to the hotel.....it has been my experience that Hilton hotels tend to cater to the business traveler. This location was no exception. I find that Hampton Inn, Embassy Suites and Hilton Garden Inn are more family friendly. As far as appearance, this hotel has a beautiful lobby and being right around the corner from the Fashion Institute of Technology (where my daughter attends school), it was nicely decorated with fashion themed items. The room was small (as are most NYC rooms). We never felt crammped though. The bathroom was very nice and had all the amenities you would expect. Traveling with a family, it is always nice and convienient to have a microwave and fridge. I knew going in there would not be either of those. I was willing to do without those for 3 days for the savings. There was a stocked mini-bar with drinks, snacks, etc. I enjoyed the Keurig and Newman's Own coffee. It was a nice touchHilton properties never disappoint when it comes to bed comfort. This hotel was no exception. The beds were so comfortable and the bedding was plush and wonderful. I have a bad back and found the beds to be very comfortable. I would have preferred Queen beds (Hilton Garden Inn has Queen) instead of double beds, but we made due. I did find the service in the lobby less than adequate. Several days we were in need of a cab and none of the staff out front offered to hail one or even seemed to acknowlede you exhisted when you came and went from the hotel. They were all just standing around. I had the opposite experience at the Hilton Garden Inn on 26th (which I will also be reviewing). The subway (red 1 line) is about a block away and is a 5 minute ride into Times Sq. and the Orange line is a few blocks away as well. There was no free WiFi, which is a must when traveling with teenagers.. This was definetly an inconvienience. Parking was available on the same street at $40 a day. No in and out privledges. It was fine for us because we moved our daughter out of the dorm and then parked the car for the duration of our trip.Overall. it was a nice stay and the quality was what you would expect from a Hilton property.

It is nicely decorated. The restaurant in-house offered great food at great prices, just order your meat cooked higher than you'd like. I ordered medium well and got medium rare. The rooftop bar was charming. The iron provided in the room was very good, and there were brand name toiletries in the bathroom, but bring your own shower cap. none provided. We decided we needed to stay two more nights, but the hotel wanted $700/night. Not the way to treat a customer. CONS: Our room was on the 8th floor, facing the street. I heard cars honking, people yelling, traffic noise and there was construction work that woke us up very early in the morning. The AC in the room made a lot of noise. The ironing board in the room was useless. The closet was ridiculously small. The rooms are kind of small, like in many other hotels in the area. The elevator situation at night gets complicated with ""bouncer"" type guards don't allow hotel guests to use a certain elevator(s) because they need it to escort people up to the roof top bar. It gets annoying, but I guess they do it to make sure random people getting in the hotel's hallways.I hope I never get to stay there again.

The reception is quirkily decorated with coloured bobbins in a Mondrian style and with the silver bobbin detail on the reception desk; it was quite nice to see the hotel chain personalise their hotel to the fashion district. As I additionally have a Hilton credit card, I am supposed to get free Wi Fi in all Hilton Hotels, due to my levels of expenditure on this card, but no one seemed to know about it there. In the end we got the WiFi in our room but not without an arduous elongated discussion first. Room was nicely decorated, fantastic coffee machine! Loved waking up and making those and watching some american television from our bed. There was dedicated space to store luggage so you weren't constantly aware of your suitcases. Bed was very comfortable and we both slept soundly. Only problem would be that the safe is in the upper part of the wardrobe in the darkest part of the room so it really was a case of scrambling around with your hand in the dark trying to locate stuff inside the safe. Location is great as we know the whole Chelsea, Meatpacking, Village areas well and feel very comfortable there. Whilst we were staying we used the Rare Restaurant and went to the Rare Bar several times for cocktails. We also had drinks before going out in their Rooftop Bar. Obviously this was in march so the glass roofing was across but I imagine in the summer it must be great. Fantastic views across New York skyline. Wonderful cocktails! Caroline the bar tender made us feel very welcome as well as mixing great cocktails! Decor up there was a bit grim though with pine tongue and groove panelling. Never been to a bar in Alaska but I imagine it must be similar! As it also is a ""Rare"" bar I don't know why it was not funky like downstairs. Fantastic views irrespective! As a Hilton Honours member I stayed loyal to the brand and booked this hotel as part of a flight hotel package for a 4 night break to NYC. What I have observed from many previous Hilton hotel stays - and also this one - is that they take your loyalty as a given and I have yet to see any type of actual perk to me in using their hotel chain worldwide for the last 18 months. Whilst I would certainly say I had a great time at this hotel, had I ditched my loyalty I could have had a much better deal elsewhere with a hotel on parr with this one.","Kent, United Kingdom","stfx5</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kent, United Kingdom</strong>",280,4.0

Enjoyed it very much except the downtown tour the concierge turned us on to..that was a disaster!We were unhappy with the NYC bus tour that the concierge agent sold us as great!He said we just had to walk down to 5 th ave and go left and 2 or 3 block would be the bus station. It took a long time to figure out (too vague) then when we got on the correct bus the tour person would not except the vouchers the concierge had given us. This tour person made us get off the bus....saying they don't except vouchers and we had to go to 48th st to another station to exchange for tickets which was 20 blocks away. We called the Hilton and spoke to desk and then concierge and he said they (the bus) should have taken the vouchers and we should try again and if they tried to stop us we were to call him. We did this and again the tour person did not want to take them, we had to plead with him. Then we let the concierge know we got on but the problem all this confusion was over 1 hour of time. Then problems started with the tour..the bus stopped because they were done for the day and we (everyone on the bus) had to get off and get on another bus at Battery park because that bus was done for the day. More problems with tickets agents (3 guys in red jackets came up on the bus upset about our vouchers not wanting us to get on this second bus! Finally they decided we were OK and exchanged the vouchers for tickets. ...Then and a long line of people in front of us so by the time we got on this new bus we had the worst seats. We drove in that bus and you could not see anything because the plexiglas covering over this double decker was so badly scared the city was a blurry mess! Then in Time square the tour guide said again everyone had to get off the bus and wait for the next bus since that bus and guide were done for the day. It was crazy at that time of day at time square and we could not even get near this next bus so we walked out of the crowded area got in a taxis $13.00) back to our hotel. Never go to finish our $115.00 tour of downtown NYC. The problem mainly was the fact that the concierge agent did not understanding what the tour was going to be like and he sold it to us as if he had done it him self and loved it!

And you don't really stay in the room much. Our room was at the back of the building with basically no view other then another building close by.

Their rooftop bar is a nice place to hang out with pretty good views, (although they serve the drinks in plastic glasses which is a bit bad for the feeling).

But walked to most places from the hotel.Cons: Heating/Air con was a really stupid system that bursted out hot air when it feeled that the temperature had dropped below the setting. It also made a lot of noice and the air got really dry. As it seemed to be a fairly new hotel you would have thought that this could have been better.

The lobby staff were lukewarm at best, and the receptionists were aloof and disinterested. This hotel could be so much better if management trained staff or got rid of receptionists who weren't interested in their jobs, considering competition in NYC is so fierce. Not the standard you would expect from Hilton staff. We rang up wanting some more coffee delivered to our room, only be be greeted by ""What do you want?"" in a rude, bored tone. Everything was a bother and nobody seemed interested in helping or being friendly at the receptionist desk.

The room was a decent size for one person, maybe even two. It's definitely a business hotel with people always on their phones, laptops -- on the go and not too many families around. Being that it's in the fashion district, the lobby and overall hotel presentation (as you can see from the hotel photos) is modern and hip. Even if it's on an off-street from Fashion Avenue, you get a lot of noise, but maybe it's because I was on the second floor right above the front entrance so I could hear people taking smoke breaks, taxi drivers pull up on the drive way, doormen, trucks delivering things for the restaurant downstairs, etc. So if you are looking for peace and quiet and a feeling of privacy, probably not your hotel, although they have a fresh pair of ear plugs on your nightstand every night. However the room itself was clean and comfortable. Nice bed and clean bathroom. A big plus about this place is LOCATION. You are very close to a lot of attractions and also to transportation hubs (Penn Station is right down the street). Everything is pretty much in walking distance. Overall, I would probably come here again for the right price, and if my room was higher than the 2nd floor and not over the front entrance.

It is not a large hotel and with 3 elevators (great for getting up & down quickly) many are across from or behind the elevators.

I don't recall how much we paid for 3 nights, but I recall it being a phenomenal price for New York City.The service here was great. Upon check-in, we were provided 2 bottles of water and some candy. In fact, anytime we asked for more bottled water, the front desk gladly provided it. Our room was also a great size (for NY standards). The room was clean and updated. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was updated. Everything about our room was very tastefully decorated, which we appreciated.Rather than going on and on about our room, all I can say is that we had an absolutely wonderful stay at the Hilton. Also, the hotel has a restaurant/bar in the lobby (which we did not get to try) as well as a bar on the roof. We did visit the top-level bar every night that we were there. Drinks were not outrageously expensive and it was never too packed for us to enjoy a drink or two.Also, we loved the location of our hotel. Since we flew into Newark Airport, we took a train from Newark to Penn Station. The hotel is a few blocks' walk to/from Penn Station. Also, the hotel is close to several subway stops, and is within walking distance of some great restaurants (we walked to Boqueria and Gramercy Tavern).If I had any complaints about our room, it is that the rooms facing 26th Street (such as ours) is a bit noisier since you hear a lot of traffic from the cars below. On our first night, we were awoken at 1 or 2am by a delivery truck that was honking its horn. If possible, I'd ask for a room that did not face 26th.

On W26th St. near 7th Ave. It is well located for access to lower Manhattan as well as tourist central in the 40s and 50s. The service was decent. The room was on the small size (about 12X15, not counting the closet, bath, and small space the door opened into). The size left room for only two small nights stands, the king bed, and a desk with chair. A mid-size flat screen hung on the wall. On the plus side, everything as neat and clean. As a hotel, as such, this Hilton might get a 3.5 or four, depending on the night's rate. My based rate given a Sunday night stay, senior citizen discount, advance payment and February ""dead season"" timing was $189 for a king-bed room. I called the hotel directly to make a reservation. Then, unlike me, I bought some upsell by the agent. I decided on a high room he offered to get a view. That took the price to $219, but what the heck, it was a post-Valentine's Day trip. I was thinking of driving in,so I asked about parking. The agent said was would be $40 a night, but added that for an extra $50 a night (taking it to $369) I could get parking and a full breakfast for two. That was not a great bargain, but it did save a bit on breakfast so I agreed. When I got to the hotel, I pulled in up front, handed by keys to the bell hop and told him I had a parking package. Off went the car. When I got to the desk, they said that the reservation was only for either parking or breakfast not both. When I wonder why I would pay a $369 package price for parking what I could have bought separately for $10 less, the clerks basically shrugged. They produced a copy of the email confirmation that did say one or the other, which as not what the reservation agent said. I protested that the pricing made no sense, and after a bit of off to see the manager, they eventually did offer the two breakfasts as well as the parking. They also noted that the parking, if separate, would be $55, not $40. Huh? Anyway, with the pricing in hand, so I thought, up to the room we went. The room was high, I guess, on the 18th floor, but the view I had paid $20 a night for was a dingy wall with windows from which others could view me if I want to let light in my room. This was not my understanding of what a view should mean. Back to the desk. They came up with another two floors, directly above the old room, which a last gave me a view of the rooftop on the adjoining building. I settled for this, and all, I thought, was well, until I goy my checkout bill. It comped the meals, but only one night of parking. Now the figure was $65 a night. Back to the desk. They had no thought of why the clerk had said on Saturday the cost was $55 a day, but did offer that the older number, $40, was for self-park, not valet park. This was new news in the fluid price structure. More grumbling by me eventually got the $65 off the bill, although the clerks gave me that ""hustler: look. Another little gotcha was that the full breakfast, was not quite the full breakfast menu, but a limited selection from it on a special voucher menu. That selection was good enough, but like the rest of the offerings not was it seemed . Now maybe I should have checked the confirmation more carefully, but given the price that seem unnecessary and, besides, I had never had such a divergence between the offer and what the charges were. I can't say ""do not stay"" at this Hilton because, at a base of about $200 a night, the place is reasonable (but not exceptional). But put on your reading glasses to scan the small print and put on you lawyer hat to make sure that what the reservation agent says and what the hotel is offering and at what price is accurate.

I flew out to Whistler to ski the next day and of course came down with the same symptoms the bartender complained of (and lost my voice just as she was). I realize there is no guarantee that it came from her, but it ruined my ski vacation. I e-mailed Hilton to let them know what occurred. the logic was that given the horrible germ season, the hotel could remind the employees not to come to work sick. I got an e-mail back from ""Wanda"" that said the hotel would contact me within 3 days. They never did and Wanda hasn't responded to my follow-up email. This tells me the hotel does not take health safety complaints seriously.","Charleston, South Carolina","W T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charleston, South Carolina</strong>",0,2.0

I've learned recently that you don't have to put a dent in your pocket to get great quality service. Too bad it took several overnight stays in New York for me to find the perfect hotel. Again, I will be honest with you when I will tell you that I truly believe you pay for what you get...but after booking rooms that have range from $350.00 to $425.00 a night I was a bit hesitant when I found the HIlton New York Fashion District and only paying $137.00 a night. I read the reviews and questioned myself over and over again. Then finally I booked it with the hotel directly. Chelsea, who helped book the reservations was friendly and had a great personality. I checked in this past Sunday to be greeted by professional staff members. Although my room was not ready at time of arrival I understood it was only 11am and may have to wait until 3pm to do so. They stored my luggage and off I went to hit the town. The location is perfect for those who want to do Uptown or Downtown. It's close to the subway and a skip and a hop from 34th Street. Finally, I received the call around 3pm that my room was ready...Whaalla! I opened the door to room 211 and was very suprised. Not only was the room equipped with a MP3 player, Keurig, large flat screen mounted on the wall but also had all the ammeneties that you would need to make your overnight stay comfortable. Overall, if you are looking for a great, clean hotel that is going to leave your pocket full then choose this Hilton property where you will find the staff pleasant but also very eager to help you in any way. This will be the one any only hotel I will stay at for furture trips to NYC.","Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania","ARMANICHIC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania</strong>",102,5.0

Just as reference, I stayed at two other NYC hotels within the following month, neither of which could hold a candle to this place.This is a fairly small hotel by New York standards and had a boutique feel to it. The lobby is fairly small but hip, fashionable and sophisticated. Front desk staff was extremely accommodating, friendly and helpful.Perfect location. Away from, but within reasonable distance to, the theater district and touristy and bustling Times Square. Quieter and less congested. Food is less expensive than it is 12 blocks north and tons of non-touristy dining options. Starbucks around the corner. One block to the subway. Whole Foods a block and a half away. Greenwich Village and SoHo close enough to walk. I loved my room! Killer view of the Empire State building from the floor to ceiling windows. Modern elegance with a large desk, ample storage and a good size, well appointed bathroom. The room was small, but also a good size for New York. The bed was extremely comfy and the pillows were rockin' perfection. Large screen TV. Large granite shower (no bathtub) and decadent, fluffy white towels. Great lighting in both the room and the bathroom. Keurig coffee maker. Real glass glasses, not plastic. The perfect cocoon in a huge and busy city. Upstairs bar/lounge is nice with great views. Non-hotel guests to the bar are taken up a separate elevator to maximize guests safety. Guest access to other floors is prevented by use of a system by which you need your room key to press a floor button. I appreciated the thought given to safety.Downsides?? Not anything earth shattering. The top guest floor can sometimes be noisy from the bar above. I had only three days of late night noise/music as I was just under the lounge. But most of the time was fine.  I would hate to have booked this hotel just to get a room on the back side. The front side upper floors has the great view. I fell asleep every night to the ever changing colors of the Empire State building. There are no ice machines on the floors. However, one call to room service and they bring it to you, no charge. If you want a small fridge, just ask the front desk and they'll bring one..also no charge.I look forward to the opportunity to stay here again.

This is one of the best hotels for the price in this area. I consider this one of the bangs for your buck in NY. It's close to Macy's, MSG, Times Square, the Flat Iron, the fashion district, and countless other things to see and do.The hotel has a little fashion theme to it. The front desk staff is very courteous and willing to accommodate. If you arrive on Sunday they give you a glass of champagne when you check in, which I think is a cute touch. Don't bother valet parking the car with the hotel. There are A LOT of garages around the block that are much less money. My only complaint (which is true for all Hilton Hotels) is that they charge you for WiFi.The rooms are clean and laid out pretty well, they provide a decent amount of storage (for NYC this is great) and they're quiet. They're not huge, but I challenge you to find a room in New York City for under $500 a night that is. They have nice clean updated bathrooms. Some rooms on the front of the building have a nice view, but all the others overlook an alley and other buildings.For dining options, the hotel has a great reastaurant called RARE in the lobby, and a FABULOUS roof deck when it's warm out. And in recent years there have been some great additions restaurant and Nightlife wise. Restaurant options in the area I could recommend would be Mario Batali's Eataly, Pipa Tapas Bar, and Cipriani. And after dinner I would highly recommend the roofdeck of the hotel if it's warm out, Maysville is a really cool whiskey bar, and Toshi's lounge has life music which is REALLY entertaining.Overall, if you are visiting this area I highly recommend staying at the Hilton.","Boston, Massachusetts","Danielle R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",5,4.0

Only things that can use some immediate improvement were the lightings. The room was very dark at nigh even with all the lights on, especially in the entrance. The bathroom light was very bright so good side is you can see what you're doing, but the light made one looks very haggard. I asked for a refridgerator and they brought me one for use during my stay.My booking came with complimentary breakfast at the Rare Grill. The breakfast menu was ok and sufficient. They also have a buffet but I think the a la carte option is better and fresher. The breakfast entree all had meat (except for the waffles and continental pastries). I'm a vegetarian and they had no problem at all making me a veggie omelet. Hotel location is awesome. Just a couple of blocks away from the 1, 2, & 3 subway stations; Duane Reade drug store, and Whole Foods.

This went from the Front Desk to housekeeping to the restaurant.The hotel is noisy -- mostly because the doors seem almost spring loaded. One night, I had a couple of people on my floor who were were in and out of one anothers' rooms and banged the doors even greater gusto. Why can't hotels put springs on the doors to make them close quietly? I see that Premier Inns are planning it in the UK and this will be enough to get me to stay there when I can. There are only ten or twelve rooms per floor but if you get the wrong ten people, the corridors can be noisy too. Again, there is a lot to be said for signs and noise alarms in the hallways.My only other complaints were one lift was out of order throughout my stay -- on one evening, only one lift was working, Each lift is used by room service, housekeeping and guests for the rooftop bar so it can get slow. The mini ironing board in the rooms is almost unuseable -- proper ironing boards, please! The rooms are well furnished and smart but there's nowhere to sit. The Keurig coffee machine may appeal to some but the tea it produces is quite foul; the hotel should have electric kettles available for those of us with more primitive tastes (I had to go out and buy one along with some tea bags. I left it there so they now have at least one to loan you)My view of the Empire State building was lovely, the heating was fully adjustable (it was minus 15 C outside; in most New York hotels this means boiling inside but here it was easy to get comfortable) and the bedding (complete with high quality duvet cover) was excellent.

It is a non-smoking hotel know we knew why they had to have ""extra"" time to clean one of the rooms. It smelled pretty gross for someone who doesn't smoke. When we look at the menu to make sure room service was 24hrs, the staff had no idea what we were talking about. We thought it was our mistake looked on the website and it clearly states 24hr room service provided. The only thing nice about this hotel is the resturant next door called Rare. They have pretty good food and good drinks. I would not recommend anyone to go to this hotel even if it was for a weekend like we did.

Pleasantly surprised with the free red wine served at check in with little goody bag of treats. I learned there was a catch - but more of that in a bit. This property is very trendy - one of the most interesting branding designs I've seen in a HIlton property. The vibe was hip and groovy but not in an rude or unapproachable way. Reserved through Hilton.com for the best price - about $30 less than nearby properties. Well worth the $199.The check in staff were great - I did receive 2 bottles of free water as a HHonors member at check in. Unfortunately I had an early flight and couldn't take up the offer for a free breakfast voucher. I regret not going immediately up to the rooftop bar to check it out - and I ended up being out too late to see it that night. But I imagine that if its anything like the rest of the property, it's a great hang out spot.After check in, the fun started. The elevators were haywire. Unfortunately, a staff member with service key, was running the elevators manually, old school. To get a lift back down from your room, you had to call down to the front desk for a lift. Inconvenient. But the staff were in such positive spirits through this, probably huge pain, that it wasn't a problem.Had a great burger with belgian style fries and drinks at the adjoining restaurant, Rare. Probably one of the top 5 burgers I've had.Check out at 5am the next day was fine - as was the valet elevator services from the 21st floor. The doorman had to run out to 7th Ave to Flag a cab for me, but it all worked out fine.Overall, an excellent stay due to the great staff and neat digs of this unique HIlton.","Madison, Wisconsin","Tourcation</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Madison, Wisconsin</strong>",18,5.0

Our offices were very close hence Hilton Fashion District was the most logical choice from a distance point of view. So that is its main (if not its only) saving grace, in my view. The service was below expectations for a Hilton hotel (i.e. I'm not asking for rose petals or ostrich-feather fans. This is not a luxury hotel and I'm on a business trip.) I was expecting at least competent staff with enough knowledge to execute basic transactions like dealing with an extension request or explaining differences between rooms. The staff handling the request couldn't wrap her head around what was going on with my booking and with those requests. At some point, she referred to her colleague who was equally lost. I just came from a 16 hour flight and didn't want to prolong standing at the reception while dealing with staff who obviously didn't know what was going on. I gave them time to sort it out till the following morning. Unfortunately, it was the same banana the next day. That sort of experience upon arrival leaves a bad taste in your mouth and makes one more critical of the hotel you're in. I was annoyed that the room they gave me was on a lower floor, looking out to a busy street - thank you for all the traffic noise - just what a jet-lagged person needs. I just didn't have the energy to deal with the staff again for a change room request. The walls on the hall were a sick shade of green that reminded me of a hospital or a low-end hostel. I could barely wait to get out each morning so instead of staying to have my breakfast there, I would dash out to grab something at the corner Argo Tea place.Overall, Hilton Fashion District was adequate accommodation for someone travelling by herself with no romanticized agendas and just expecting pure utility. It provided a bed to sleep in at a location that suited the purpose at that time. Unfortunately, nothing more.","Sydney, Australia","Bizmum</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",15,3.0

Convenient to downtown, midtown, just about anywhere. I've stayed at this hotel about 5-6 times in the past year and it's become my go-to in NYC. It's a stealth little hotel -- even cab drivers are surprised when I tell them the address and say it's the Hilton. Everyone says ""there's a Hilton there?"" It used to be an independent hotel called the Fashion26 and most people don't know it changed to Hilton a few years ago.The hotel is modern, clean, and just good all around. The only drawback is that the rooms are pretty small. I expect that in NYC, so it's not that big a deal. But the room is very functional and the bathroom is new/modern and very good. Beds are comfortable, internet seems to be consistently fast, and service is pretty good.My biggest complaint is as a Hilton Hhonors Gold member, I don't seem to get an upgraded room very often. Usually the front desk doesn't even acknowledge that I'm entitled to an upgrade -- even if an upgrade isn't available, I wish the front desk would just tell me that. Instead, I go to my assigned room and it's always a mystery what I'm getting, and I'm usually disappointed. The upgraded room, when you get one, is only a little big larger than the standard, but that makes a big difference when the rooms are so small to begin with. I also tend to end up on a low floor -- usually the highest I get is floor 12 and I think there are something like 25 floors in the hotel. I'm not sure who all those people are getting high floor rooms if a Gold member like myself isn't getting one. One time I did have something on a high floor and it had incredible views of the Empire State Building. Here's hoping I get one again someday.Despite the upgrade issue, I still usually stay at this Hilton because it's good in so many other areas and the rate is usually pretty reasonable. I recommend trying it out if you haven't stayed there -- definitely better than the Four Points Sheraton a couple of blocks away and better than the Hampton and Hilton Garden Inns I've stayed at in the general area. I used to stay mostly at the Doubletree in Chelsea, but when I discovered this Hilton for about the same price, I've never looked back.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","sfguy24</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",79,4.0

Every once in a while, we heard the neighbor's door close, but overall, it was pretty quiet.HOTEL SERVICE - The room was kept pretty clean. There was one day housekeeping failed to leave us washcloths. The hotel took care of this right away and provided us additional washcloths and Hilton points. The bar staff at RARE was very nice and always attentive. The hotel concierge was hit or miss with their recommendations, so I would do your sightseeing homework before hand. SUBWAY - The hotel was so conveniently located near three different subway lines, so finding a route and getting to our destination, whether uptown or downtown, was not a problem at all.TAXIS - Some of the taxi drivers didn't want to drive right up to the hotel because it was located in the middle of a city block.

We arrived on New Years Day for 3PM check in, however our room was not ready. The front desk staff did the best they could to resolve it as quickly as possible. They explained that as it was New Years Day, and therefore a holiday, there had been many late check outs which had put them back. We chose to wait in the lobby until the room was ready as we were tired from the flight. The staff offered to look after our bags until the room was available. We had to wait until 4.30 until a room was ready, which wasn't ideal but understandable under the circumstances. For our trouble we were upgraded, given free breakfast on our first morning and free wifi for the whole trip. We thought this was a fantastic good will gesture from the hotel and really smoothed out the rocky start. We were on the 5th floor over looking 26th street. I was woken up at 2AM by garbage vans on the first night and again at 5AM by other external noises - but that's New York! We got some ear plugs and slept soundly for the rest of the trip. On the last night we were disturbed by noisy guests in the corridor at 2AM and again at 4AM, but this was down to inconsiderate guests and not the fault of the hotel. On our first morning we ate breakfast in the hotel and the standard of the meal was excellent. Great portions and really tasty food. The location of the hotel is also really handy for getting round Manhattan. We like to explore on foot and we were able to walk to most places. We only got the subway a couple of times, and the station was really close to the hotel. On previous trips we've stayed in the theatre district which can be a bit full on. The location of this hotel is perfect if you want to relax into New York life. There are plenty of bars, restaurants, cafes and delis in very close proximity. We liked Sunac deli, which is just around the corner from the hotel. We also went to the Hog Pit bar and restaurant on 26th st, which I also recommend.

The location, the service and especially the price are just some of the selling points for me. The rooms are of a good size, and include all the neccessities, bathroom is very nice, and daily roomcleaning. There is enough room for storage. You might hear some street noice mostly trucks in the middle of the night, but that never bothered me. And there is carpetry on the floors, so if you are allergic, like me, remember to take your pills with you (i'd forgotten mine). But does are just minor points. An extra bonus was the popcorn machine and complimentary wine at the reception in the afternoon. For eating NYC is excellent, when you walk out the door and turn left and then right on 7th avenue, there 's an excellent breakfast diner, that offers everything you might be craving for (just forgot the name). And right on the corner ther's a Chipotl, oh soooo yummy Mexican food. I could go on and on. Macy's is just a few blocks away, as are the other major departments stores.

We stayed for 4 nights over the New Years period.The room, albeit small, was nice and modern. It would have been good to get a larger room for 2 twin beds but we were willing to live with it because we had just come from awful experience at another Hilton Hotel down the road. We booked a twin room on a high floor, but this did not really provide a view. Just a view into some offices across from the hotel. So I don't think I will be spending more for a high floor next time.The location is great. Close to Penn Station, Macy's and Times Square. There are also some subway stations close by so you can get around Manhattan pretty easily.The staff (front desk, conceirge and restaurant) were great. Very helpful.As an HHonors Gold member we got free breakfast which was excellent.Another small thing to complain about is the the cleaning was not always up to scratch. You could tell that there were different cleaners on different days. Some who did a great job and other who just ""tidied up"". But this was not a train smash as the beds were always made and the bathroom (most importantly) was adequately cleaned.

With Time Square but 20 minutes walk away, the city becomes a mega-magnet for visitors at this time of the year and accordingly prices seem to match the heights of the skyline for which NYC is so famous.However, price aside, the Hilton Fashion District Hotel was a good location. We arrived in NYC by Amtrak from Washington at Penn Station and the hotel was but a convenient 10 minute walk with suitcases (on wheels).The hotel room was a little cramped but this was partially due to the number of suitcases that we were travelling with. Essentially, it was central to most activities to which we engaged ourselves during our 3 night stay.The Negatives:Unfortunately, we had a negative encounter with the hotel housekeeping at the Hilton Fashion District of a type we have never experienced anywhere else in the world. My wife went to make a coffee on our second evening in the hotel and discovered to her disgust that the housekeeping staff had given us (disposable) cups that had obviously already been used. They had what looked like hot chocolate “lip marks” on the outside rim of the cup. I took the cup down to Reception in the lobby and, to their merit, they quickly replaced it with clean cups and gave us some breakfast vouchers for the hotel restaurant to apologize for what had happened.One needs to be weary of the elevators at this hotel. They use an unusual security system that requires guests to swipe their room card over a sensor to gain access to their floor. This caused bedlam when the elevator was full of people - each reaching over one another to swipe their card... I actually found that once swiped I could access any floor in the hotel!Perhaps this feature was the reason for huge delays when waiting for a lift – up to 5 minutes. We were on the 4th floor and became adept at using the staircase to dodge the bottleneck.","Auckland, New Zealand","holidaysinc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",26,3.0

Comfortable bed, new electronics. Nice bathroom products and attention to detail with the coffee machine.

But, it doesn't deserve the Hilton Brand, which in my opinion stands for a certain minimum quality level all over the world. For once I didn't book directly through the Hilton portal and used Expedia instead. A big mistake. Although the rooms on both portals had the same price, the Expedia booked rooms were stripped of all Hilton hhonors benefits. As a long term Hilton dedicated guest (see my other reviews) I've never had such a cold reception at a Hilton branded hotel. Furthermore, although booked well ahead (august) we were appointed some very small rooms on very low floors. More importantly, the rooms we were appointed were not clean (stains on bed linen, lipstick marks on glasses and even the minibar menu (???), sewer smell in the bathroom (although not uncommon in NYC) and very dusty. This remained the case during our stay with housekeeping putting the paper covers on used glasses.... Although the hotel appears relatively new, many things are already worn out, obviously as a result of using low quality materials (window shades, heater, carpet, etc). The hotel has too little elevator capacity and as a result expect to be waiting for one (both in the lobby and on your floor). To add some excitement to the elevator experience, the hotel has adopted a security system that does not work properly so expect people frantically trying to select their floor number...To finish of the 'great' experience the hotel provided us with transportation to the airport which nearly killed us before reaching the airport as the driver fell asleep behind the wheel. I wonder if the 'only cash payment (no credit card) to the driver' system of arranging transportation provides the guests with the Hilton class service the brand stands for...As mentioned, the hotel does what it should do (provide a place to sleep) and it is located great (with both the downtown neighborhoods and midtown well accessible), the subway is nearby and around the hotel there are multiple options for a quick breakfast, coffee or some groceries. It is however a three star hotel at the most. and for that, there are cheaper options around.

Our new flight had us arrive earlier to the hotel than originally planned. The hotel had our room ready. I was feeling a bit under the weather our first night and went to the hotel's restaurant to buy a cup of tea to take to the room. The restaurant hostess brought me the tea with honey and insisted that there was no charge. We spoke to the two female concierges a few times over our trip and found them to be very helpful. We like to walk, so the hotel's location didn't pose as a problem to get to restaurants or theatres.

The room was well appointed with 'stylish' black furniture (with silver pull handles) and the hotel felt ""fresh"". It is one of those small footprint, high rise hotels snuggled into West 26th street between 6th and 7th Avenues. The room was cozy. It was smaller than the Hilton Garden Inn rooms, but had 'style'. Bathroom was large enough to accommodate two people. Good hot water and water pressure. The breakfast, which is included because of my status in the Hilton Honors program, was excellent. You have breakfast in the 'Rare' restaurant attached to the hotel. Many good cold and hot choices you ordered from a menu. My daughter ordered the three eggs with bacon, sausage, home fries and toast. A lot of food. I order the granola and yogurt with fruit, also a very large portion. The coffee was good and strong and not watered down.The location of the hotel is excellent for those who enjoy an easy walk to The High Line (highly recommended), Chelsea Market, and the beautiful brownstone neighborhoods between 20th and 27th streets between 9th, 10th, and 11th Avenues (very much 'old' New York). The hotel is also an easy walking distance to lots of retail shopping in Herald Square.Knowing that we would be visiting the city after Xmas, I booked this room in early October and it was very reasonable.

Enjoyed the free wifi in the lobby - gave me the ability to quickly check my phone for emails and keep connected with my hubby without being fully ""linked-in"" (it was a girls' trip, after all).Would definitely consider this hotel again, however, I prefer to book via Priceline if travelling with my hubby and one bed is sufficient.",Toronto,"yertletheturtle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto</strong>",12,4.0

Self park at MPG parking on 26th street, drive car there, parking attendant will give you a ticket, he will park your car. Alternatively, valet parking is available (drop off in front of the hotel). Cost to self park is $40, $10 more for Van or SUV. Get your parking ticket stamped at the front desk to get those rates. Tip is $2 (for me anyway). Parking is good for 24 hours from the time of entry.2. Recommend high floor, quieter, nicer vew (although rear just faces the back of the another building).3. Got room via AAA for a good rate (for some reason, non available online)4. Kudos to the friendly staff !!5. Clean room, nice shower, glass partition - Very comfortable bed - No issues with TV - Coffee maker includes regular and decaf, tea serving - Room faced the back, asked foe was not able to get a front facing room but minor issue6. To uptown (Broadway shows), take the 1 (“One”) train to the 42nd street stop (second stop). Cost is around $2.50 per passenger. We took the NQ or R train on the way back, but it stopped in a different location. Still close to the hotel. Just be aware in case you get disoriented. Best is to take the “One” train back if possible. Staff mentioned cab rides also easy way to travel.7. As far as nearby restaurants – I disagree with the other posts saying there are few places to eat. There are two BBQ places on the same block, a Japanese restaurant nearby, Korea Town just 2 or 3 blocks away, so plenty of places to eat, but may not be open 24 hours though.8.

I went over early before check in time, so i left my luggage with the hotel and went to woodsbury for shopping spree. I'm not used to the culture of tipping coming from where i am from (everything has service charges in the total bill) so i didnt tip. When I arrive back from shopping with 1 luggage bag and 7 to 8 bags of clothes, the bellboy handed me my luggage bag and expect me to go up to the hotel room myself, because i didnt tip him earlier. Imagine this, 2 Big luggage bag (1 i bought from woodsbury), 1 backpack, and 7 - 8 bags of clothes. I cant even walk on a straight line, they just smile and walk off.2. I was checked into a room that is at the end of row (not my preferred room as listed in my hhonours membership) and to make the thing worst, the room is facing the main road, I basically have to put my noise cancelling headphone on just to sleep.3. I complained to the hotel, they manage to get me a new room, which is on level 7 facing the back , which is 500 times better. 4. Tipping, knowing that it's a culture there, i started to tip, and the service is much better, the bell boys was so efficient, taking my bags when i checked out, and getting me a cab and arranging my bags in the cab and making sure that they close my cab door.

Location wise, its great for all the usual tourist stuff, with good cafes and coffee shops very close. On the negative side- there is no kettle in the room if you drink tea( just a tasimo coffee machine) and the minibar is designed so that if you want to put anything in it ,you cant! Really clever and 100% business minded, yet it felt a little cheap. Didnt see any doorstaff, so you were on your own trying to get a taxi.","Toronto, Canada","amandad74</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",24,4.0

Having requested a room on a high floor with a good view, I was given a room on the 22nd floor. Great you might think! However, if you read other reviews the problem with the 22nd floor is that it is directly below the roof top bar on the 23rd floor and there is music playing until 12.30am. So beware of the rooms on the 22nd floor if you are looking for a quiet room with no noise!My first impression on entering the hotel is that it is quite dark. The carpets on each floor are a dark colour, the elavators are painted in a dark brown colour as are the skirting boards. The room itself was much smaller compared to the one I stayed in at the Millenium Hilton 5 days earlier. There was no bath in the room just a shower which was perfectly acceptable for my purposes. Again dark carpets and walls!Despite my comments about the roof top bar, I would recommend that you visit it to experience the view especially of the Empire State Building. There is a private elavator which takes you up the bar from lobby level. The girl who takes you up in the elevator is extremely friendly and pleasant as is the girl who meets you once you reach the roof top. I found both of them to be a very personable and a credit to the hotel.Guests also have access to a small business centre located behind the check-in desk where you can print off boarding passes and also access the internet free of charge!In summary, not bad hotel although if I had a choice, I would choose the Millenium Hilton over this hotel despite its location in Lower Manhattan.","Glasgow, United Kingdom","piere44</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glasgow, United Kingdom</strong>",44,3.0

They were in town for the Interop Conference at the nearby Javits Convention Center on 34th street. Our meetings were in the Hilton's conference room. It all worked out very well, included wonderful weather for travel.The Hilton is a small boutique-ish hotel with a very small lobby and limited drive-up area. The hotel was nicely updated and well staffed with friendly people happy to help you with walking directions or to offer you a small popcorn snack when you check in.Room. My room was small with a king sized bed. There was a nice desk area, and plenty good Internet ($14.95/day) and HD TV. The bathroom has been updated very nicely; no bath tub, just a large walk-in shower. My schedule was such that I needed to work late into the evening, and I had a room service dinner at 10pm... all was fine.Conference Room. Our meeting room was plenty big for our needs. Our hosts ordered breakfast and lunch; it was nicely served buffet-style and we always had a hotel staff person nearby to clear dishes and keep things tidy. The conference room did have one draw back: it is three stories underground. That means very limited mobile phone coverage. We did have WIFI; it worked ok, but it meant people had to go up to the lobby to take calls. It was ok.Walking around. I am always a tourist when I go to Manhattan. For this trip I took advantage of the hotel location and went for a walk to 5th Ave and took some beautiful late afternoon pictures of the Flatiron building and the Empire State building. Further, I went for a walk through the Flatiron and Garment Districts, stopping for a nice break at Herald Square. The hotel is about 4 short blocks from Penn Station.Airport transportation. From LaGuardia, I took the NYCAirporter Express Bus. The pickup was right outside of baggage claim. I paid the nice guy in the green suit coat $13. I had to wait 10 minutes for the bus. It took me and about 20 other people to the Grand Central Terminal. It was 4pm and the ride took 25 minutes -- traffic was heavy but not stop and go. From there, I connected with a van that took me right to my hotel -- about a 15 minute ride. It should have been much quicker except we had to wait for a garbage truck and we got stopped by a firetruck / ambulance. This worked well for me and I would do it again.Taxi. Of our course, having done my first bus ride from LGA to Manhattan, on my return trip I took a taxi ($44). I just ran out of time and needed to quickly get to the airport.

Far enough from Midtown so you are not greeted by Mcdonalds and lots of tourists..but lots of great bars are restaurants nearby....10 minutes from Chelsea, it's just great and Hilton is a name you can trust. 2 PC's in reception - free of charge, cash machine, printer, bar..the breakfasts are great too.","Manchester, United Kingdom","worldwide002</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",87,4.0

In a nutshell: Our standard room with a queen bed was nothing special, but we found the service and location to be outstanding.Room experience. The first room reserved for us (18th floor) had an overpowering sewer smell in the bathroom. When I complained, we were able to move immediately to another standard room on the 17th floor that did not have this odor. Though our room overlooked the street, we were high enough to escape any traffic or pedestrian noise. Our small, but adequate, room had a comfortable bed, a nice flat-screen TV, a safe and a compact ironing board with iron. The bathroom had a shower (no tub) and no towel racks. There were shelves below the sink to store things but I found these impractical for wet towels. We found the A/C to be difficult to regulate and thus we were often too cold or too warm. The Housekeeping staff did a fine job on everything except the carpeting. Two small pieces of string and a thin layer of dust that edged the room's perimeter greeted us on arrival and still decorated the floor upon our departure. A bank of elevators stood outside our room. We only heard noise on one occasion -- a rowdy group got off an elevator at 2:30 one morning and awakened us. These elevators proved to be fast and efficient and our longest wait was about 1 minute. We appreciated the free USA Today newspaper that was delivered outside our room each morning. But we thought that wi-fi should also have been free. There is a $14.95 daily charge for wi-fi unless you have a certain standing with the Hilton Honors program. Myriad New York City hotels offer free wi-fi, so if this is important for you, go elsewhere.Service. This was exceptional. Check-in and check-out at the front desk went quickly and efficiently and someone always addressed inquiries/concerns in the same manner, along with a friendly, upbeat attitude. Everyone at the concierge desk during our stay also proved to be outstanding in their attitude and helpfulness. They gave really good information about transportation, places to eat, directions, etc.Location. This was excellent for our situation. We arrived at Newark airport and took the train to Penn Station. From there, it was a mere 10-minute walk to the hotel. I was interested in learning more about the Chelsey area so this was a perfect spot to be. It was an easy walk to Chelsea Market, the High Line and art galleries. There are many restaurants, cafes and breakfast places in the area and Macy's and Fifth Avenue shopping are also nearby. For those who aren't walkers, there are plenty of subway stops and buses around. For others interested in learning more about Chelsey, I would recommend the Big Onion tour of Chelsea and the High Line. It starts a few blocks from the hotel and allowed me to learn much more about the area than I would have wandering around on my own.","Tucson, Arizona","Rumples</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tucson, Arizona</strong>",3436,4.0

Our check-in experience was a drawn-out-affair, with them being unable to locate our reservation for some minutes. It may seem like nothing, but after a long journey, this simple clerical error was very ill-timed. On our first night, we decided to make use of the rooftop bar. The drinks were very expensive, but we drank whilst enjoying the view. That is, of course, until a drunken member of the public, who introduced himself to us by drunkenly and repeatedly ""giving us the finger"", possibly because we are a gay couple, intruded on our evening. He was being watched by the security staff but clearly they thought his behaviour to be acceptable, or at least, not bad enough to remove him from the premises. We then decided to leave the rooftop bar, and judging that to be the average standard of customer, did not return for the rest of our stay. It is a shame that the security staff's reaction to his behaviour prevented us from enjoying the rooftop bar, further. In a further encounter with security staff from the rooftop bar, a 40-something-chap with blond hair and an abrupt attitude very curtly told my partner and myself to vacate a lift he held, empty at ground level solely for use for the rooftop bar, with several groups of people waiting in the foyer area for the other lifts. His manner was abrupt, and his logic still escapes me.The lack of complimentary WiFi was annoying, and since we were staying for ten nights, we saw the daily charge of $14.95 as rather excessive, particularly when other Hilton hotels in the city, and every Starbucks, provide this, gratis. We made limited use of the two computers available in the foyer, though this area has little or no privacy when performing tasks such as internet banking - indeed, on one occasion, I was forced to ask a hotel member of staff to leave so that I might continue.On the plus side, the room was well appointed and clean. The air conditioning a little loud, but at least worked reliably during the hot spell which encompassed all of our stay. The hotel is a good base from which to join the subway, explore the city, and get to know NYC. But, and I say this as a frequent traveller - Hilton hotels, at one point, were about luxury and attention to detail. It's a shame that my abiding memory of this hotel, during this trip, is that it was normal, that is to say, nothing special, and that we came to treat it as the average room in which we slept, before leaving each morning to enjoy more of that amazing city. On balance of price and facilities, combined with the incidents detailed above, I'm afraid I cannot recommend this hotel.","Bristol, United Kingdom","Mark01824093</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bristol, United Kingdom</strong>",119,3.0

Overall, I am happy and consider coming back, especially if I stay by myself. Below are more details:Pros:(1) decently priced. It was cheaper than Hilton in the Times Square, or New York Hilton. One of the more reasonably priced four-star hotels around Penn station.(2) Close to Penn station (34th and 7th). The hotel is located at 26th and 7th, so it is 8 blocks walk. It's not much. It takes about 10-15min.(3) Less touristic or more quiet than the Times square Hilton or New York Hilton. Several coffee shops and many good bars near by. Not as crazily touristic as those around the Time square.(4) Clean. I read (might be wrong) that it's relatively new. And the interior has a bit of hip (boutique hotel) flavor. Something like (a bit cheap version of) W hotels.(5) People at the hotel were nice, cool and efficient. It helps that it's a relatively smaller hotel so there's no crazy check-out line.Cons(1) The room is small. But it is typical NYC size. So it's not really a cons.(2) There is a rooftop bar. I was expecting a cool, quiet bar with a nice view, but it was noisy (DJ was playing (college) party music), and the decoration/furniture is not really good-taste. Naturally, the people at the bar was not really cool. My friend and I were disappointed and left without ordering anything. Especially since the hotel is sort of cool, and the hotel bar on the ground floor is also cool, I was expecting something nice, but totally betrayed...(3) It's probably not a cons either, but the hotel is sandwiched by two buildings, so there is no view from the hotel. I have to use the curtain not to be seen by people in rooms on the neighboring building. But I guess it's also typical in NYC.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Makoto N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",110,4.0

I had to follow up in order to know when was a good time to return to take my luggage up to my room. There were a few other issues too - all tied to lack of communication. I found out by chance that because I booked half my staff with reward points and other half paid, that I would need to come down at 12 noon on the change over day to get my card refreshed to be able to enter my room again. Also, I had to ask about my breakfast coupons. For some reason my room didn't have any washcloths. I called down to the front desk and received a couple, but same problem continued throughout my stay. On the positive side, I did appreciate some of the personal touches acknowledging my visit. The property was well kept and I liked my room. The location worked for me. I requested a room that was away from the front of the building and was not close to the rooftop bar. I did venture up to the bar for a little bit, but since I don't drink I didn't stay long. The view and breeze were nice. For the most part staff was friendly.

I did ask to change rooms and was given one. Both rooms were very small, the décor non descript modern but the rooms clean. I did go up to the (small) rooftop bar, and enjoyed the views over Manhattan, and mercifully, the party noise did not carry into the rooms below. But all in all, this hotel was too expensive for what it offered, the service being merely OK and far from exceptional. Also, in a supposedly 4star hotel I expected to have proper cups or mugs for tea/coffee rather than the standard take away containers.

I just do not get the decent reviews. Here's my experience:PROS: Good shower, comfortable bed, and a keurig for coffee...CONS: Rooms: the rooms are seriously the size of a postage stamp...tiny for NY standards even...the closet is about 18 inches wide, no lie, bathrooms are also small with no tub, our view was of a ugly wall with traffic noise below. Those who were lucky enough to get a higher floor may have had a better experience...good luck getting one.Service: Horrible at best. We called ahead to reserve a ""higher floor with king bed"" and were told that that would be taken care of. Upon arrival there were none available and we arrived at 12:30 willing to wait!! We asked front desk to please move us to a larger room...no can do, so sorry. The concierge was lacking in providing helpful information. I could figure out my answers better than she could.Location: I did not like this area...it is not really near anything so you have to know the subway system well enough to get around or taxi anywhere you go unless you want to walk 1-2 miles. Subway is a couple blocks which is not bad. Lobby: Tiny! You walk into hotel greeted with a line out the door of people waiting for an elevator to get to the rooftop bar. Elevators are slow and HOT! Hallways are dark and narrow.Pool: What pool? No pool. NOT FOR KIDS!: no pool, can't go to rooftop bar with your kid unless he/she is 21, rooms are too small...there is no extra space.Wifi: no wifi...unless you want to pay a small fortune for it during your stay. They have it in the lobby...ha!...there is no room to move in the lobby.Bottom line is I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone and will never stay here again.","tyler, texas","BEACHLOVA1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>tyler, texas</strong>",13,1.0

Also, one night me and my girlfriends came in late, and were starving; all of the food place in NYC close early (11pm-12am), but the front desk helped us with a takeout menu. Watch out for the Concierge Service! It’s a rip-off, and they lie to you! This would be the downfall of the hotel. I feel taken advantage of and lied to. I was sold a CitySights NY tour, which I was told would be the best way to see SOHO, Little Italy, Chinatown, Statue of Liberty, and Ground Zero. You are much better taking the subway and doing your own thing. In addition, Concierge Service is a third party company and has nothing to do with the hotel. Therefore when you are angry management does nothing, and say oh they are an outside company. Well I think that you could have done something more than Complementary Breakfast that cost under $ 40 for three people. Brandon the Bell Boy, WOW!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! Brandon is the best employee this hotel has! I only wish that we would have met him a pond arrival and not our departure. He took are bags and put them into storage for us, and booked us a very nice SUV for only $65 with tip. He told us to have fun and safe travel home because he would not be there when we retuned at 6pm for our bags and car ride back to JFK. However, to our surprise he was still there and very patient as we had to get stuff into other bags. Finally before our departure from the Hilton, he said can I get a group picture for you ladies, very professional and a pleasure.

We are Hilton HHonors members and try to stay at Hilton hotels whenever we travel. Two of the best things about this hotel was the location and the rate. The rates were competitive and we got a great value. Being just off 7th Ave., we were only 2-3 blocks from a subway stop along the 1 line; that took us pretty much wherever we needed to go. We were also reasonably close to the Hudson River Greenway, which was great for a morning run. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was excellent and the roof-top bar was great fun! Definitely get a drink there to appreciate the NYC skyline. It's not a very tall building, but the roof has nice views of the Empire State Building and Downtown. There was no ice machine, so we were able to request complimentary ice from room service whenever we wanted it. One time they ran out of ice buckets and had to deliver our ice in a bag, but that wasn't really an issue. We only had 2 small issues while staying here. First, our check-in was a little messy...we were given keys to a room that had not yet been cleaned and promptly called the front desk. Then, we were escorted to a new room--which had also not yet been cleaned. Finally we were shown to a 3rd room that was perfect. It was just a small hiccup, but I've never had that happen before. The only other issue was with washcloths. We only received washcloths on 2 days of our week-long trip. Every other day we had to request them, even after I left a note for housekeeping. I'm not sure what the problem was, but housekeeping always brought them to us fairly quickly. It was kind of a nuisance, but overall not a big deal.The fitness room was small, but at least it was something. There were 2 treadmills, an ARC trainer, and a stationary bike.

The bell stand held our bags while we were getting lunch at Eataly. We returned a few hours later and checked in. The room key cards don’t need to be inserted into a slot to open the door, just waived in front of a key pad. That was convenient for entering the room.

The shower was all tile with glass doors which leaked all over the floor, even during a short shower, leaving the bathmat a soggy mess.Breakfast was included with our room. It was served in the restaurant on the first floor which is called Rare. For Hilton Honors Gold and Diamond, there’s a choice between a buffet or a pre fixe menu which included a choice of eggs, French toast, or pancakes, a side of bacon or sausage, toast or cereal and a few other items. We were also served a good sized fruit bowl that was really good. Having a choice to order from menu or buffet was nice, not all Hiltons offer that. I had the buffet one morning which was pretty standard for a Hilton (breads, cereal, scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon, yogurt). The next morning I had over-easy eggs that were good as well. Juice and coffee or tea included. Service was good both days.The hotel doesn’t have ice machines available. We asked where they were and were told “this is a full service hotel. Just call room service and they will bring you a bucket of ice.” What they didn’t tell us was that there was a $3 delivery charge! Plus you’ve got to tip the guy who brings it, so you’re paying $4-5 for a bucket of ice. That’s irritating. There’s a Duane Reade right down the street which sells ice for only $2. Pick up one there if you really need it. There are three elevators, but one seems to be reserved for the rooftop bar. Either that or it just wasn’t working while we were there. We waited for a while for an elevator several times when we were trying to leave. The location of this hotel is its best feature. It’s on W. 26th between 6th and 7th. You’re a short walk to shopping on 34th, about a 15 minute walk to Union Square, there are several subway stops nearby, and lots of good restaurants. It’s centrally located and an easy walk to a lot Manhattan has to offer. I probably won’t return to this Hilton. There are better hotels in the area in this price range.","charlotte, nc","inhiding</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>charlotte, nc</strong>",19,3.0

I dropped something that rolled under the bed and discovered other guests dropped items and a lot of dust ! It was obvious no one had ever cleaned under the bed which was disappointing.

Again, it's New York and that notion is understood. My room was very clean and pretty spacious for NY standards. The only reason I did not give it a 5 was because one of the elevators was broken during our two night stay. They have either three or four elevators total and only one was operating to/from the rooms. The others were solely being used to take people up to the rooftop restaurant/deck/bar.

A subway that goes North/South (#1-2-3) was only 2 blocks away - on 28th & 7th. We stayed for 5 nights and bought a 7-Day Unlimited Metrocard for $29/each. The only disappointment for this hotel was not having free wifi. We both had ipads with data plans so we got what we needed but when it was slow and it was frustrating to know that Wifi was just a click away...at $15 bucks. Bummer.I wish I caught the name of our bellman. We had him both in/out and he was very personable and eager to help you. It goes to show you that being ""nice"" doubles your tip. If you are driving into the city, a nice ""perk"" was that the hotel is set back a little. Enough so you can pull into the ""U"" shape driveway and unload your luggage stressfree with no one behind you. We parked our car for $20/day at Alliance Parking across town. Pre-paid online, dropped the car off, picked it up 5 days later hassle free. Quick from start to finish. The beds in the hotel were AWESOME! Soooo very comfortable after a long day and night in the city.I did notice some minor issues with the elevator. You had to swipe your room key infront of a small black circle then push your floor. Although this is the same technology that worked perfect to get into your room, it didn't work so well in the elevator. After I understood how it worked, it still presented problems for other people as well.

The staff at the desk were very friendly and consistently offered their services. While I do agree with others that the rooms are small, our King room had a very comfortable bed and a large washroom with great-smelling toiletries. The minibar was such that you couldn't open it without being charged - a definite negative that you can't keep cold drinks in the room. Add to that that there are no ice machines and the only way to keep things cool was to put them on the air conditioner (which actually worked quite well)! Two computers in lobby allowed us to check email and print boarding passes so no paid internet time was needed.The location was good - not much in the immediate vicinity for those of us who like to walk everywhere, but within 15 minutes you can be close to Times Square or the village.

The beds: the most comfortable beds I have slept in a long time. After a full day of walking around NY these beds were heaven!2. cleanliness: 5 stars for this. I travel a lot and I have very high standards when it comes to this. Everything in the room was spotless and housekeeping did a great job every day. 3. Location: really good location. Easy to get anywhere from the hotel.4. Roof top bar: very cool spot with amazing views of the manhattan sky line.Cons1. Wifi is ridiculously expensive!!! They charge $15 PER DAY PER DEVICE which is an absolute joke. Get with the times Hilton, if Starbucks and McDonalds can provide free wifi your charges are just ludicrous!2. The lobby is very dark and the hall ways are very narrow and has a retro feel. Not what I'm used to from Hilton hotels. I understand that they are trying to be stylish and fashion forward by the name of the hotel, but it actually feels very gloomy in the lobby and very motel like in the hall ways.3. The mini bar works on a stupid sensor system. And the fridge can not be used for anything else as it resembles a vending machine, not a standard mini bar fridge. Very annoying when you are staying for 10 days and want to keep some cold drinks and things in there.4. Rooms are small. Yes I know, this is Manhattan and space is at a premium, but there is absolutely no room for 2 people to keep their suitcases open on the floor. At least they provide enough drawer space so we could unpack  completely and put our suitcases away for the duration of our stay.5. Rooms are VERY dark. Even with all the lights on and bedside and desk lamps on the room felt very dark and claustrophobic. 6.  Quality of towels was poor. For the first 7 days we received quite threadbare and small bath towels and for the last 3 days we got nice big fluffy towels. Again, not what I'm used to from Hilton!7. Room service food was quite average. Ordered a burger which was greasy and soggy and a salad which was rather bland. Unacceptable considering it cost $45 for the two items!8. Staff at check in was quite rude. We arrived late at night after 30 hours of travelling and we received a very cold welcome and a rude attitude form the girl at the front desk. Wish I remembered her name.9. Toiletries provided were insufficient, they provide mouthwash and sewing kits but no body wash or shower caps. Weird!So there you have it. Quite a lengthy list of cons compared to the pros. Would I stay there again despite the lengthy list of cons? Yes but ONLY if they wake up to themselves and stop charging for wifi. Given how expensive hotels are in Manhattan this hotel would be good value for money if they lift their game a bit and come up to par with other Hilton hotels around the world.","Colombo, Sri Lanka","Rachi P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colombo, Sri Lanka</strong>",62,4.0

The roof top lounge is a complete joke, it's like a casual lounge trying to be a club, and each night they totally monopolize one of the elevators to shuttle people up and down from it. The space would be much better as a casual lounge for hotel patrons, with food service and drinks (right now it's drinks only). Another note about the elevators, don't be surprised if one of them takes you for a ride up to the 20th floor even though you're supposed to be goind down, they have a mind of their own, and also get stuck frequently but don't panic it only lasts a minute. The rooms are a really nice size with extremely comfortable beds and nice amenities in the bathrooms. Front desk staff are amazingly helpful and eager to please, as are the bellmen.

Narrow and tall building. When entering the small lobby, you face a bank of stainless doors elevators. On one side a small front desk. Very little space for seating. The room floors have a single narrow hallway for about 12 rooms per floor. So, this is not a typical Hilton brand setting.As for the building, one nice thing is that it is relatively more soundproof to external noises than other close by hotels. Unfortunately, not soundproof from inside. Thin walls. You can hear every slamming door on the whole floor, and all the conversations in the hallway. More unpleasant, I was able to hear the guest on floor above …….. having a pee. Had the pleasure to hear it to the last drop, and then the toilet flush: not very classy …..The rooms (including bathrooms) are spacious. A single closet, quite small. Large working desk. Comfortable bed. Housekeeping OK. A/C not the best for temperature control and comfort. This is a window-type system, so noisy, and when you are on the bed, you take the air flux straight on you. Almost impossible to have it working at night. Besides temp control is not very accurate: its rather on or off but barely controls anything.At Hiltons, you expect a certain amenities. You don’t find the all here. No guest services directory in room. None of the usual visitor’s magazines (you have to pick them up yourself in the lobby). No ice bucket (useless anyway, no ice machines). Generally,the staff is nice, smiling, polite and helpful. It looks to me that they try to give to this hotel a different feeling, probably because of being located in Chelsea-Fashion District. This is essentially perceptible with the restaurant decoration, the restaurant staff attitude and the rooftop bar. The restaurant setting and staff attitude there are less formal and prim than at most of Hilton hotels. It might create a surprise at first but the level of service is perfectly acceptable. The rooftop bar however is a different story. I think they do not take full advantage of this rooftop. Some tables and chairs are cheap-garden-barbecue style. You have a few sofas, but they are oddly oriented, so you don’t face the view. There is continuous very loud music played. So if you were thinking about a nice relaxing outdoor terrace, forget it. They are also using plastic glasses….cheap! Very annoying is their access policy. You cannot access it directly from you floor. You have to go down to the lobby to take an elevator that shuttles between the bar and the lobby during opening hours. In the lobby, the elevator is patrolled by a security guard that checks IDs. You have to wait in line behind a barrier. In the elevator, you are escorted by a staff member, and when reaching the terrace, guided by a third one. When you order drinks, whether you are a hotel guest or not, they ask you for an ID and credit card …. This is way too much and you don’t feel very welcome. It made me feel like I was trying to sneak into a highly select VIP night club.In summary, I don’t want to give a bad review to this hotel, because there was objectively nothing unacceptable. Probably some room for improvements to really bring it into the Hilton brand bracket: as it is now, considering it a Hilton is probably overrated.Finally, whether you will like it or not is a matter of personal taste.

I couldn't get a good rate for that hotel, so I went with this Hilton down on 26th Street and Seventh Ave. This Hilton's rooms are much, much smaller, and aim to be much more hip and trendy, with funky wallpaper and furnishings. The hotel in general is trying for that ""boutique hotel"" feeling, with a rooftop bar and a velvet rope in the lobby. Normally I feel like that would put me off, but this Hilton managed to do this without alienating any of the less trendy people staying there, and in fact, in the end I liked this hotel very much. The room we had (on the 11th floor) was quiet, and most importantly, the bed was so comfortable--very firm, probably fairly new. The room was very clean. We also had a great view--just the street below, but still nice, fun for people watching. The only thing that I did really take issue with was the lack of a full-size ironing board, since we were going to a wedding and needed to press our clothes after being in the suitcase. The Hilton Times Square has full size ironing boards and in fact a ton of room to iron--this hotel, not so much. I also didn't like that this hotel didn't have a bathtub in my room. Otherwise, I was pleasantly surprised by how nice and convenient this hotel was--close to Midtown for sightseeing and transportation, but close enough to downtown to go out to cool bars and restaurants easily.

I booked and fully paid for my room a month in advance, how did I end up with such a terribly located room? Complaining to Hilton on that one.Transportation- Took a cab from LGA at about 1030pm. The trip cost about $31 and took about 30 minutes. If you want to save money and if you are mobile enough to take the subway. Take a cab from LGA to Astoria BLVd subway station (should be less than $10) and ride the subway into town ($2.25/ride). The way to LGA- As we had to leave back to LGA at rush hour (545pm), I inquired with concierge as to the best way to get to the airport. Conceirge said it would be tough getting a taxi and I should let them book a sedan with the hotel that cost $63. Leaving to the airport at rush hour, there were plenty of cabs still available and traffic wasn't bad. I think it took about 35-40 minutes to LGA. I feel that the concierge lied to me so that I would book the sedan with the hotel and it cost twice as much as a taxi.Location- I found the location easy access to getting around NY. It is close to both the 23rd and 28th subway stations. Walking distance to the Empire State building, Times Square and the theatre district. There are a lot of food choices on both 6th and 7th including grocery stores (whole foods) and 24 hour pharmacies nearby.Staff- In general very friendly including front desk, concierge, bell boys and cleaning staff.Rooftop Bar- My favorite part of the hotel. Great views of the NY skyline and especially Empire State building. Wasn't crowded on the Sunday night we were there, which was great for me. Expensive drinks though, $14 for a mojito.Summary- The Room and concierge/taxi situation is enough of a turnoff to stay elsewhere next time.","Guelph, Canada","RM12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Guelph, Canada</strong>",44,3.0

Its a great location with a couple of different subway lines just a block or 2 in either direction, great restaurants and easy to get everywhere from, the only downside was the lack of desk staff. This is a busy hotel with a constant flow of people and it was not unusual during our stay to see a queue at the main desk with a single person serving (as was the case when we checked out), however the access to the rooftop bar had 3 doormen, an employee working the lift and 2 ""greeters"" at the top.

Each morning, we were awoken by the extremely loud banging of the exit to stairwell doors that began at 6 am daily (including Saturday and Sunday), as well as the incessant banging of the doors where housekeeping items are kept). Apparently the housekeeping was on our floor. It made it extremely challenging to sleep and no one seemed to care. The staff also chose to yell at each other in the hallways, and the walls aren't exactly sound proof! While we were there, staff were also painting the elevator doors and the doors where the housekeeping supplies are kept. We received no notice, or apology for the smell and inconvenience this caused. Each day when I attempted to find a manager or someone other than at the front desk to speak to, I was disappointed at the lack of individuals who could assist me with my issues. Even the odd individual who worked in the lobby or the concierge refused to say good morning or good evening when I made eye contact in MY effort to be polite and cordial as though I was some hoodlum off the street, not a 'valued' paying guest. In addition, on Saturday night, Sunday and Monday morning, we were also disturbed by the sound of loud banging on the rooftop for what I assume were repairs? I initially thought it was the rooftop bar speakers that were making the noise, NOT someone with a hammer. Once again, no email/voice mail/letter or attempt at an apology for the inconvenience. I am more appalled with the lack of customer service and the lack of desire to address my issues and concerns rather than the size of my room. Thankfully the gent who helped load my luggage in my car service was friendly and the young lady who helped me at check in was also kind.

I requested the hotel staff - to allow me 15 mins to get my luggage out. They refused me access to my room citing it was ""cleaned"". I asked if their own staff member can get the luggage out - was refused as well. It was humiliating and I just agreed to pay half a day charge to at least get an access to my room. As soon as I enter the room - I realized it was not even cleaned on the ground on which I was refused the access. The manager on duty was rude when I informed him about this. When I provided a feedback that I expect honesty from the staff and will definitely take up during the feedback, he offered me to waive off half a day charge - which he earlier forced me to pay just to get an access.

Whether its getting ice, some coffee, a taxi or anything else, I prefer doing these things myself. If you are this type of person, don't come anywhere near this hotel. My recent experience at this hotel bore this out. You want some ice in your room, staff will have to bring it to your room. You are at the front desk and want to switch some decaf coffee packs for regular coffee, someone from their staff will have to bring it up to your room. You want a taxi, a staff member has to call one for you. It just goes on and on. It seems like everything in this hotel exists solely to generate tips for staff. I have read other reviews for this hotel on this site and this issue has been mentioned. During my stay in New York, I switched hotels and stayed at another hotel nearby and they LET YOU get everything you wanted yourself including ice, coffee, and a taxi cab. WHAT A CONCEPT.

Rooms are ok, reminding me of a Holiday Inn Express. Very clean and fresh.

The rooms are great- not super spacious but plenty of room to settle in and spread out. The rooms are updated, fresh and modern. Beds and bedding super comfy. The location is great - close enough to midtown without being in the center of the noise. It's in a much quieter area of NYC which is ideal. If you are gold or platinum, you get breakfast in the restaurant. You don't just have a buffet to choose from but you have a menu of made to order items to choose from as well- eggs, pancakes, or French toast.

Free breakfast (part of package) was nothing to brag about, especially given the price difference from that of a normal-priced room. You'd be better off going out to the streets of NY for something to eat. My biggest gripe with this hotel, having stayed here before and having experienced the same issue, is their need for 'tips' for just about everything. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready. No problem; we left our bag in the luggage room--tip needed. We came back, checked in, and found that our bags had to be 'delivered' to room even though we were standing there and could easily have wheeled them up ourselves--another tip needed. We asked for an extra set of towels to be delivered to room since we didn't get the extra set we had requested, and then left for dinner. No towels upon return. Asked for them again and left to go out for evening. No towels for the second time. Finally figured out that they wouldn't deliver them since there was no one there to give a tip! Ice bucket--tip needed. Bottle opener--tip needed. In conclusion, I would certainly recommend this hotel, but just be aware that you need to have lots of small bills in your pocket for the tipping. It was also disappointing to learn that they have done away with the mini cupcakes upon check-in. This was something that set this hotel apart from others.",,undercoverone,49,3.0

We only stayed one night (May 13) as a little treat as part of our anniversary. We chose this property because of mostly positive reviews and a discount we had through hotels.com. Overall, everything was fine with our stay. The location was convenient and it was an easy walk to a number of subway lines and Madison Square Park. The room wasn't big, but didn't need to be, and everything was clean. We were also very happy to be able to store our bags in the basement free of charge for part of the afternoon after we vacated our room.Even though we only went up there for a minute, we were pretty impressed by the cool rooftop bar on top of Rare restaurant, located in the hotel. Great views and it wasn't crowded on a Sunday afternoon, although the cocktails are as pricey as you would expect in NYC. Certainly less pretentious than the rooftop bar at 230 Fifth!My biggest complaint about this hotel is the shower. It's small and there is no barrier keeping the water in that area of the bathroom, so part of the floor got totally soaked. I don't know why it was designed this way, but watch out! Also, there is no fridge to store things in - just a minibar filled with things to buy.","Plantation, Florida","SJC1020</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Plantation, Florida</strong>",36,4.0

The location was great - convenient to Penn Station, the 1 line on the Subway, lots of restaurants, shops, etc. Hotel was very clean and modern. The room had a minibar fridge but you couldn't use it to store any other food/leftovers, which was kind of annoying. We had some perishable food we bought, and had to keep asking the hotel for bags of ice to keep it cold. Only complaint about the hotel is that the elevator is SO annoying. You would have to swipe your card to get to your floor, and it seemed to be broken all of the time. No matter how quickly you pressed your floor after swiping the card, it just would not work. So half the time we'd miss our floor, end up on 20, and have to go all the way back down to 5. I get that they are worried about security or people just walking in the hotel, but when carrying bags, stroller etc it was a huge hassle. I hope they do something to fix the elevator system. Otherwise, price was great and I'll keep the hotel in mind for future trips to NYC.","Fayetteville, North Carolina","Lauren S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fayetteville, North Carolina</strong>",10,4.0

The good:- recently renovated, hotel is spotless throughout- location - close to midtown shopping, Penn Station, etc. without being overrun by tourists when you leave (I appreciate the irony that I don't want to be over-run by tourists while staying in a hotel)- service excellent - genuinely friendly staff that are very accomodating- Rare restaurant attached to the hotel had good service, food, and ambience. The bad (not terribly bad but enough I wouldn't stay again)- small rooms - I usually stay HIlton Times Square/Doubletree Times Square/Hilton 6th Ave which give you quite a bit more space than this at equivalent rates. Even Garden Inn/Residence Inns in NY give you better space. Was travelling with my wife and we found it cramped. - paper-thin walls - I read this elsewhere and it really is true. Example, my wife went into the wash room and I heard someone speaking, I figured she was talking to herself, or got a phone call. Turns out it was someone out in the hall, who we both could hear clear as a bell. Same for TV in room next door, was like they were in the same room. Surprising they didn't put more effort into sound-proofing in recent reno. - gym pretty basic. Older equipment, sounded like one of the treadmills was on its last legs when tried to adjust the tilt.

This was my overall impression of staying at the Hilton Fashion District. This doesn't mean to say that the service wasn't impressive or even that the location was bad....both were very, very good! We're quite familiar with the Chelsea area so found the location to be very handy for us....a short 5 minute walk to Macys, Wholefoods a block away, convenience store around the corner, Stumptown Cafe approx 5 blocks away for a great morning coffee & metro lines close by (1, F, M, N & R).Firstly we checked into #2105 (queen rm) facing 26th St which seemed to be more spacious than #2101 (facing back of hotel). Even though #2101 was by the elevator there were no noise issues. Friends of ours had #2111 ( I think it was) which was at the end of the hall facing 26th St and we would have to conclude this room was the pick ... more spacious of all 3 rooms and you were less affected from noisy people coming to/from the elevator. We were advised at Reception that rooms on the 22nd room could be affected by noise coming from the rooftop bar.The rooms were fine but nothing out of the ordinary interior or size-wise....like the Ace or the Standard for example. The rate was the major drawcard for our reservation for late April/early May. We had breakfast included in our rate and found it to be disappointing. My one tip is to order fresh off the menu rather than dine from the buffet (an option incl in the breakfast). The French toast was good. Other than that the restaurant felt dated...particularly the food and the service was so/so.The rooftop bar was embarrasingly old-fashioned with atrocious, dance party music for 5pm in the afternoon! I envisioned the rooftop bar to have a really cool ambiance, great cocktails, comfortable seating and just overall wow! There was no wow. The sofas were dilapidated and looked like they needed a complete overhaul....and whoever designed the overall interior just got it wrong.The most frustrating part of our stay was the wifi. It kept logging out each and every time I wanted to go back online. When paying for this service I find this incredibly frustrating ... Hilton needs a lesson in a working 'Guest Access Management' solution....and I'm not even in Tech!

Once I realized the train would be much later, I called the hotel, around 5 pm, to alert them and specifically requested that they not release my room, even though it would be after 11 or even midnight or 1 am before we arrived. They assured me my reservation was held. We arrived at 1 am, only to be told by the desk clerk that ""unfortunately there was a problem"" and there was no room for us. (US = myself and my 13 year old daughter, who had been on a train for about 8 hours or more.) When I asked how this happened, especially given that I had called at 5 pm specifically to alert the hotel about our delay and to request my reservation be held, the clerk said, ""there was a 'stayover,'"" and he could find NO note of my phone call in his system. When I asked what sort of corporate policy permits a person without a reservation to bump someone WITH a paid reservation, he muttered something about ""maybe a Hilton Gold member."" Ultimately, at 1:30 pm, the desk clerk had the bellhop put us in a cab bound for a ""sister property,"" with a ""letter"" to the sister property ... but didn't give the cab driver clear directions. The confusion about where we were going only increased my frustration. Also, the desk clerk advised that the stay at the sister property would be ""on Hilton,"" but of course the sister property took my credit card for ""incidentals,"" and, now, 6 days later, a $275 charge for the room rate at the sister property remains on my card.Disappointment # 2: I picked this hotel for its location and for the rooftop restaurant/bar, only to discover that no one under 21 gets to go to the rooftop (at least the night we tried to go, that was true, and when I asked the bouncers at the elevator and the concierge about it, neither informed me that it would be open for those under 21 a different night). I did not see that policy/rule clearly published anywhere, and definitely did not see it on the hotel's website. Had I known that I would not be able to take my daughter to the rooftop, I probably wouldn't have chosen this hotel. (Which may be why they didn't inform me of that rule in the first place...)I travel fairly frequently and am generally a go-with-the-flow, easy-to-please person. This is the first time I have been assertive and visibly irritated by circumstances at a hotel, and the first time I have ever given a bad review. I gave a second star only because the room was clean. I will refrain from using Hilton or any of its ""sister properties"" in my future travels. I do not believe I should have to be a ""Hilton gold"" or some other special club member in order to have a paid reservation actually held.","Staunton, Virginia, United States","Mandi S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Staunton, Virginia, United States</strong>",3,2.0

We visited on several occasions during our stay. One night however, after returning from dinner, the bar was at full capacity with a long line to get up. Hotel guests are given no priority over walk-ins. After then standing at the downstairs bar for 15 minutes waiting to order a drink from the overwhelmed bartender, we gave up and went upstairs to our room.

Friendly knowledgable staff, good rooms, good location.Overall my stay at the Hilton Fashion district was a very pleasant experience. My room was at the front of the hotel on level 8, the only noise disturbance was the refuse vehicles which visited between 1 and 2 a.m. every day, but after the first night even this did not disburb my sleep. Must mention the staff, whatever we asked was answered with a smile and a positive response. Reception, concierce and door staff were all helpful and well informed on local restaurants and transport. They even made time for a friendly chat.Breakfast was plentiful, although not the best (bacon was burnt but quickly replaced when we asked). If as part of your room rate you definately won't go hungry, but you will find better in the local area.The only small problem was the room heating, it pushed out hot air for a while then switched itself off, let the room temperature drop until you were cold and then boosted out hot air again. We were visiting in February and it was relatively mild, it could have been a lot colder and I cannot comment on the quality of the air-con for when the weather is warmer.

Experience at hotel was quite good save for a couple of things. Even as Diamond member ended up in a room that seemed quite tight... space between beds and the wall was about 6 inches at best, which made it difficult to get to the chain used to close the blinds in the evening. No sitting chair in room, except at desk. Would have expected slightly more room or least the hotel not configuring two queens in a room most likely designed for one. Second point is the food offering at the breakfast buffet. Given that this particularly Hilton appears to attract an eclectic clientele - many Europeans and Asians - the food offerings seem to be very retrograde - heavy on cholesterol - and no healthy offerings - no fruit, no vegetables, not lean protein, and no non-white flour breads or muffins. Other Hiltons seem to offer these as many clients prefer to not to eat greasy sausages, bacon and eggs every breakfast. Perhaps a change in the morning chef might be in order. Agree with other reviewers who found the motion activated lights in bathroom annoying - particularly at night when they seem to stay for a long time - the only option is to close the door. Frig in room was loaded with payables, with NO room for any personal items. On the plus side, great location and ambiance. Great views from top floor bar - BTW: the dedicated elevator after 17:00 is for direct access to the rooftop bar. I found all of the staff very accommodating and outgoing; the concierge was very helpful in finding a shop I was seeking. Nice touch was the need to use room key to operate elevator - certainly enhanced feeling of security. Wi-fi was strong - at least in my room on the top floor. Nice touch also that window opened for fresh air. Plus also was the goodly number of outlets, particularly at bedstand – which could be used to charge phone and other things overnight.Would certainly recommend this Hilton for its location... hopefully with time, healthier buffet options may be introduced and when that happens this will be an excellent property.","Portland, Maine","Mainer7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Maine</strong>",48,4.0

The lobby is very small so it's not a pleasant place to wait for your room to by ready (mine was ready at 2pm). I selected (and paid slightly more for) a high-floor room. I had a nice view of the Empire State Building but it's not worth more than $10 a night more. The rooms are small, but it is NYC, but they are comfy. King bed, large TV, nice desk space, good temperature control. There is a neat ""bar"" cabinet that holds the Keurig coffee maker (nice touch) and space for goodies (ie. vodka, snacks, etc.) that you may bring with you or run out and purchase. One downside that wasn't as bad as I thought was there are NO ice machines. You have to call room service. There is no charge (except tip) but I prefer to get my own ice and get it as often as I'd like. Not a huge deal but eh. The bathrooms are a nice size for NYC. With nice showers (with good shower heads) and a nice large vanity. The only other thing I did not like was they only had small table-top ironing boards in the room. They definitely could fit a regular (albeit smaller) ironing board hanging on the wall in the closet. It was very hard to iron on the bed and on the bathroom vanity (I tried both).All-in-all, this is a great hotel if you can get a decent price.

We stayed on the 20th floor at the back of the hotel.

The room is quite large (after reading reviews here, I was prepared to be in a cage) with all amenities (iron & board, flat screen tv, desk, AWESOME shower/bathroom, complimentary gourmet coffee maker, mini-bar), however as some have noted, no fridge. I would have liked that, as I like to keep some juice, water, breakfast items on hand, but no biggie (there is a Whole Foods 1 block away, so I went and bought as I needed). I was on the 10th floor, street facing, on a weekday and weekend nights, no noise problems at all. Bedding and towels were top notch. Service at desk was great, had umbrellas when I asked on the one drizzly night. Very friendly there. Check in and out was a breeze. A few 'odd' things, if they can even be called odd, but I wanted to mention. The lobby is small, was crowded in the afternoons when people were checking in, slightly difficult to navigate at these times. There are 4 elevators, but 1 of them appears to be a 'private' elevator, they often had someone holding the door, but with a slightly menacing look, implying I shouldn't even try to use it. And I saw guests being 'ushered' into that elevator at various times (is there an exclusive floor or club we don't know about that only this elevator goes to?). Some have mentioned speed of elevators, I never had an issue of more than a 30 second or so wait. They appear to have security in the lobby. Typically 2 guys. This is not a bad neighborhood, nor did I ever feel a need for these security guys to be standing right in the middle of the lobby and me having to navigate around them. That was really the most unnerving thing about my stay there. I really felt like I was being watched a bit, and that it was overkill. A little discretion, please. Needed extra blankets, had to call twice to get them to arrive. Lastly, skip the concierge. Twice, I asked about restaurants, she had no clue as to what I was asking about, didn't even know what I was asking about was a restaurant. How does a concierge of a hotel like this not know what Eleven Madison Park is? It's one of the best restaurants in the city. Very confusing for me when a guest knows more about the dining scene than the person who is suppose to be helping us navigate it. Wi-fi too expensive to buy. Overall, great experience.

This hotel is a nice surprise. I stayed 5 nights during a recent business trip and found the hotel to be perfectly suitable for what I needed. First the pluses--the location can't be beat. Easy walk to Herald Square for those who love to shop, great neighborhood walking for those who like that, and quick in/out to either LGA or EWR. Several subway stops are accessible within a couple of blocks with 6th Avenue close by for cabs uptown and 7th Ave to go downtown. Whole Foods 1 block away makes up for the lack of good deli take-away on the street, but 7th Avenue has plenty of other good restaurants. I did not try the hotel restaurant but the roof top area was quite nice. The front desk staff was terrific. I had an issue with the reservation reflecting the wrong room rate and it was handled on the spot to my satisfaction. They do have luggage hold and I appreciated the security at the elevator banks making sure nobody without a room key was going up. In the guest rooms the beds are comfortable and clean and the bathroom is spacious enough to actually have a counter--often hard to find in a NYC hotel room. The shower had good pressure, the towels were thick, and everything was clean and modern. The desk area provided plenty of power access and enough surface space to make up for not having a separate dresser. There are drawers in the desk for people like me who are staying several days. End tables on both sides of the bed also had power outlets--great for charging a phone overnight and still using it as an alarm. Heat/Air in the room was reliable and efficient. The closet is small, but adequate and there is an in-room safe--a must for any NYC hotel I stay in. The CONS:Construction on the restaurant meant my 4th floor room was very loud well into the wee hours of the night. One night off-loading of scaffolding lasted until about 4 am. This was incredibly disruptive. I strongly encourage a high floor room. The room does not have a microwave or mini-fridge, which for short-stays is probably not a big deal but it would have been nice to have as I don't eat out every meal. The nearby Hilton Garden Inn does have these things and having stayed there as well for an equally long trip it gets my vote over this hotel. The decor is not my taste. Very dark and metallic. That doesn't impact anything other than personal preference. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who is traveling to NYC for business or pleasure.","Atlanta, Georgia","TVBelle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",54,4.0

Also breakfast a la carte (which is included if you book with breakfast) was fantastic. There are loads of restaurants really close by - the concierge advised me to go to ""Eataly"" which was a really good experience - two floors of what can only be described as an ""Italian market hall"" serving every type of Italian food imagineable - I went to the seafood concession, sat at the counter and watched them cook mouth watering dishes.You have to go up to the rooftop bar whilst at the Hilton too - great vews of the Empire State building which is just a few blocks away.

Although we had requested an early check in, the hotel was fully booked and they were unable to accommodate us. The front desk however, was willing to place our luggage in their luggage room and we were given a call when our room was available. This hotel has a feature where you need your key to use the elevator, which made us feel a little safer being in the building. We also constantly had to request towels and toilet paper and each and every single time they responded within 10-15 minutes.

We ordered room service from RARE and all of our meals were delicious and it seemed that they were sent up as soon as they were ready.

While it wasn't the tropics, the staff at this Hilton couldn't have done a better job making our weekend special! All I did was put a a little footnote in my reservation on Hilton.com that we were celebrating our anniversary and who knew I'd end up with complimentary champagne and chocolates and a hand written note in our room congratulating us upon arrival in our room. We arrived at the hotel in the morning and an extremely friendly young women behind the desk addressed me by name, congratulated me on our anniversary once she pulled up my reservation, and answered all my questions about dining and parking. She had a room ready for us but asked me if I'd be willing to wait, check my bags w/ bell hop until a room on a higher floor w/ view of Empire State Bldg was cleaned and ready. I agreed to wait for the room w/ the view, which she provided at no added cost, though the website offers them for a higher rate than other rooms. We set out sight seeing for the day and returned to get our keys. The same women came out from behind the desk, greeted me by name just as I entered the door, congratulated my wife on our occasion, handed us our keys, and offered us cupcakes. She was super sweet and deserves an A+ for her hospitality. She got a bellman over to promptly deliver our bags. Hallway are narrow, but not atypical of any other NY hotel. Room was relatively small, but brand new, and modern. Minibar was stocked, though we didn't use it. We were provided with instructions on how to access rooftop bar and given info on dining. We saw a Broadway show that night and took in the sights, so never made it to the rooftop, but in the short time we spent in this hotel, the service was top notch, the bed was super comfortable, and I couldn't have asked for anything more. And for the rate I got, it was a better experience in other NYC hotels where I've paid double or sometimes triple. The location is perfect, just south of MSG, in the Fashion District, short walk to the subway, and plenty of quick food options nearby. I find it a good spot to get some peace and quiet but easily access anything needed in NY. I walked to Herald Square in about 5 mins, made it to both Times Square and the Financial district in about 10 mins on the subway.

The staff were quite friendly and down to earth, and overall the hotel represents good value for a budget stay.My biggest disappointment was with the buffet breakfast which had very limited and poor quality food choices.

On the checkout date, our friend in room 311 took her bag and left it in our room. When we returned at 11:30 to the room (checkout is noon), we discovered 1) key card to our room had been nullified; 2) key card to her room still worked, but when we opened the door, the room had been fully made up with other people's belongings in her room. We went downstairs to complain because apparently the room was being used by someone else even though we haven't checked out. Front desk was unbelievably rude. Cut us off. Wouldn't even let us explain our full story. They repeated over and over that it is policy to put others' luggage in the room on the checkout date if there is no luggage of guest (in whose name room was under) in room, as guest often leaves without officially checking out.

In fact, we could have damaged another guest's belongings as we had full access their luggage. Despite the bad policy, we would have been not so upset had they been more considerate. Instead, they were rude. Manager came up. Was not rude but was very surly. Not once was there an apology ""we're sorry to inconvenience you. we're sorry it happened. We understand your feeling.""

The hotel entrance is set back from the street on 26th Street just off 7th Avenue (between 6th & 7th) and has a funky foyer with friendly reception staff and concierge between 8am-8pm. I requested a high room facing the Empire State Building based on advice here and were given a room on level 17 but on the other side of the hotel with no views. Our room was very very small, on the emergency exit map you can see that on the Empire State side there are 7 rooms and on the opposite side there are also 7 rooms but these include the 3 elevators and emergency exits to stairwells so space is a premium on the elevator side. Our room was very modern and clean with a very comfortable king sized bed, there was a small desk and chair and a small wardrobe with a safe. We had 2 large bags and had nowhere to put them apart from on the floor as there wasn't enough room to store clothes in the wardrobe. As such they were on the floor and we had to squeeze around them. I guess that you don't spend much time in the room apart from sleeping but it was a pain when we were in our room. I suggest you travel lightly (bit difficult though when you are from Australia).The room was very quiet on the 17th level apart from the noisy air conditioning unit in the room which we had to leave on most of the time for our comfort. We both slept with ear plugs because of this. Beware of the mini bar system, if you remove an item you can't put it back and are charged electronically. We didn't use the mini-bar but on our 3rd day a staff member arrived to restock the mini bar and replenished several items which of course were used by a previous guest. Of course at check out all of the replenished items were on our bill, thankfully the staff removed these without any fuss.There is a bar in the lobby and also a wonderful roof top bar which is great to see the city lights at night including the Empire State Building. You can enjoy a very nice meal in Rare Bar & Grill. We had 2 meals here and loved the lollipop chicken wings (very spicy) and the cobb salad and grilled salmon salad.There is also an ATM and 2 complimentary computers in the lobby but no free wi-fi. The closest subways are the 1 train on 28th Street & 7th Avenue or the N-R-W train on 28th Street & Broadway. You are very close to Madison Square Garden and Macy's. Get up to Korea Town on 32nd Street and Broadway for some great Korean food, or great burgers at Shake Shack in Madison Square Park (opposite Flatiron building) and don't miss Eataly (also opposite Madison Square Park on Broadway.The Hotel was very clean and nice with friendly staff although a little bit secluded from all the action but reasonably close to the Subway.

Its pretty unremarkable by every measure, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing for a New York hotel. Pros:-No executive lounge, so breakfast is downstairs at Rare. I've actually decided this is a good thing since the food is good and has a lot of options. Hilton Times Square has the same deal since they don't have an executive lounge either.-Rooms are nice, and the size is fine. People that are saying the rooms are small obviously haven't stayed in a lot of hotels in new york. If you want to see tiny go to a courtyard, hampton inn, element, or any of the really tall narrow hotels. The rooms are probably between 200-300 sq ft which is definitely smaller than the Hilton Times Square, but comparable to Hilton New York, the W and a lot of other hotels in the City.-The location is pretty good. Its a couple blocks from the subway, walking distance to a lot of good food in Chelsea, close to Penn Station. Its definitely a hike to Times Square, Central Park etc but doable if you like to walk.-It was way cheaper than other hotels. I was originally planning to stay elsewhere but it dropped to 109 a night in the winter whereas others were barely under 250. Cons:-Like others mentioned about the elevators, its a lot of floors for a few elevators, it wasn't packed until my last day there and the rooftop bar closed early and there was still a lot of waiting around for a packed elevator.-No executive lounge for those that careSome of the other reviews mentioned issues with the rooms or staff, I had no problems with either. Its hard to pick a favorite New York hotel since I've had good experiences with quite a few over the years.

It interrupts me, as well as on these last two nights I was here, both times the trays were left outside the door at 8pm and not picked up until almost 2pm the next day. they had even put my morning newspaper right next to it so its not like they didn't pass directly in front of my door.Hilton Fashion District, you're about to lose this Diamond Status Member, as well as my coworkers that I've booked stays here for too, someone who loyally stays with you nearly every other week and currently has three weeks of reservations in January. Comp'ing my breakfast is no longer going to cut it and make up for these avoidable, sloppy errors. I'm too busy at work to deal with little stuff like this. I want to come back to my room, have it be cleaned without having to ask, have my trays picked up and carry on.","New York City, New York","fritoboater</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",11,3.0

It was fairly last minute so we didn't have a lot of time to research hotel options. We chose this hotel as it was in the area we wanted to be in and had a good rate through Expedia.ca. The location turned out to be very good as you could walk to many stores or hop on the subway which was not too far away. It is close to things but not in the thick of it which is my preference.The hotel is new and clean but as it is a big chain hotel there is not much in the way of charm but was nicely decorated. My only complaint about the lobby is that it annoyed me that in the evening one elevator was taken off service for the rooftop bar so you had to wait awhile and it was usually quite full. The rooms were quite large considering this is New York. The bathroom had lots of counter space and was clean which is all that I ask for. My only complaint about the room is that the doors bang shut very loudly and I was startled awake a few times in the night when a neighbour would return to their room. It may be because our room was at the end of the hall and the noise echoed in the small alcove we were in. Having said that though the beds were very comfortable and I did manage to get a good night sleep most nights.There aren't too many options for breakfast close by the hotel but the porter told us about the Malibu Diner on 23rd just east of 7th which was fast and and good value. We ate there for lunch our first day and then went back for breakfast another day and it was good food both times. There is a tea shop called Argo on the corner that had excellent tea (the best I've had outside of England, which I know isn't saying much but it was very good) and they also had good muffins.All of the staff were very polite and helpful and the doormen and porters in particular were very helpful recommending places to eat getting us cabs.Helpful hint: if you are arriving on veterns day keep in mind the parade starts near this hotel and traffic is worse than usual for the cab ride from the La Guardia if you happen to land mid morning.","Toronto, Canada","BudgetPrincess</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",6,4.0

But they do well with the limited space. The beds are nice, good work area, nice bathroom with upgraded bath ammenties and a nice flat screen. The design and decor of the hotel fits its location- the Fashion District. The service however, ranks much higher than other Hiltons. There is a strong sense of service here and it's evident. The only downside to the hotel- to me- is the onsight restaurant, Rare. It's an upscale burger bar, but that's really all they have. The breakfast isn't good and the dinner consists of virtually all burgers- which if you don't want a burger, isn't going to give you what you want. But, there are a ton of restaurants very close by.

Our room was quiet, spotless, and the service was excellent. The beds were VERY comfortable, and the bathroom/shower were wonderful, very spa like. Also, there is a Keurig in the room for coffee, and a 37"" wall mounted HD tv. Lastly, the rooftop bar was a beautiful space, enclosed with lots of seating and amagnificent view. Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful; I would absolutely stay here again.However, there are 3 minor issues that some travelers may find fault with: (1) no fridge in the room; (2) no ice machienes (you call room service to have it delivered); and (3) very limited selection of tv channels. These are very minor inconvienences when compared to the positive aspects of the hotel; however, they may matter to some.Other items worth mentioning about the area; Chelsea is wonderful and only a 5 minute subway ride on the 1 train to all major attractions (subway one block away on 27th St). Also, if you stay, do not miss the following eateries:1. Brooklyn Bagels on 8th Avenue between 26th and 25th (best NY bagels you'll find)2. Two Bros Pizza on 6th Ave and 25th st (Excellent pizza for $1 per slice, open 24 hours)3. The Doughnut Plant on 23rd between 7th and 8th, next to Hotel Chelsea. Quite possibly the best doughnut ever.

It is convenient to the #1 train to go up Broadway. The only downside is that the wait for the elevators is longer than it should be. It seems that the algorithm being used to route the elevators needs reworking so they don't always go to the lobby when not in use. We ate a light dinner one night in the bar on the first floor (RARE) which was quite good (I had chili and Lisa had soup).

Prior to arriving to the hotel I encountered some hiccups with booking the hotel. I notified Elle Lee of my issues and I must say that she went above and beyond in every aspect. She not only ensured that the issue was resolved prior to the stay, but she followed up during, and even after the stay! This customer service did not stop with Elle, every time I passed an employee whether it was a member of the maid service or a maintenance individual, each one made sure to greet me, ask me how my stay was, and wish me a well day. My friend and I were also late getting back to the hotel (we overlooked the correct checkout time) and the staff was very understanding. (HOTEL) The hotel is exactly as pictured on the internet. It is clean, modern, and situated well for individuals wanting to visit far south areas like the World Trade Center Memorial and Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island or Northern sites like Central Park and Times Square because it is a short walk to the 23rd/28th/34th subway stations. I personally walked to Rockefeller and it was an easy walk. The rooms are a bit on the smaller side from what I'm used to (but from reading other reviews, it is larger than the average New York hotel) , but It is a small trade off compared to some of the other hotels where I saw that guests have to share a community bathroom! I also did not experience any of the noise from the street or from the rooftop during my stay (19th floor), and when I walked the street early in the morning or later at night I did not hear any of the noise. In fact, I believe there was a sign on the street for drivers that notified them that there would be a fine of $350 if they honked their horn, and it was video enforced.

If you do, you're often disappointed. So that was my approach with the Hilton Fashion Dist. What I got though was a really outstanding hotel with great service, great rooms and an overall outstanding experience. The rooms are a decent size, and the way they are furnished makes them better to use than many larger ones. Clean, modern, homely and quiet yet still really funky. Everything has been thought out well to make the best use of space. The housekeeping staff were fantastic and having little extras get such as the safe, iron and iPod docks really do make a massive difference (especially if you don't pack your iPhone charger!)The bars were great and reasonable, and Rare View really does make you feel like you're in a movie with its fantastic views across downtown and midtown. The staff were all incredibly polite and friendly, and always looked to help in any way they could. They weren't pretentious or snobby as you can sometimes find. A really great assert to this hotel. I would stay here again, although I have two minor suggestions and one major criticism. The criticism - $15 a day for wifi is ridiculous. Seriously, this adds on to the price of the room, and I'll be honest, I will be calculating it in when I next look at hotels in midtown. It's a rip off and I've never paid that much for wifi anywhere. Suggestions - the mirrors could be better placed - having only one on the bathroom door away from a good source of light is a nightmare when getting ready. Also MORE CUPCAKES! They're lovely, but in four days I only saw them once!Sort the wifi out and I won't give other hotels a thought.

The rooms could be better insulated for sound as you hear a fair amount of noise no matter where your room is (from outside and from neighbouring rooms) but still got sleep.Would have been nice to have a couple of extra facilities like a guest laundry (though there is a laundromat across the street for holiday-ers who like to keep on top of their washing!). Gym is small but serviceable for what you'd need.All in all, very pleased with pretty much everything with this hotel!

Heated and cover, really something to take advantage of year round. -Updated - The hotel really does feel new. It's clean, and I like the modern feel of the hotel-Location - It's a 5 min walk from Penn Station but just far away enough to miss that crazy midtown bustle. The location was a big plus. -Housekeeping - Really did a great jobWhy you should look elsewhere:-Rooms are tiny. We asked for a queen or a king, and were given two doubles. Not sure how they crammed two beds into the room. It faced another building, so no natural light and no views. The beds were so small that when my honey turned over, I had no blanket was was falling off the bed. Horrible sleep. The staff didn't care. The hotel was ""sold out"". Didn't look like it was sold out. -Staff: I've already alluded to the staff. Maybe we weren't wearing the right clothes, but they acted so rude to us. I was shocked. Here's an example. We were going to a rehearsal dinner that night, and had put our bags in luggage check during the day. When we asked for our bags, it took us 10 mins to find someone to actually help us (front desk wanted no part of it, and I was sick of them flirting with each other and being snotty), and another 15 mins for them to find our bag, and then another 20 to hail a taxi. We ended up being late to the rehearsal dinner because of the hotel. When I asked and talked to the manager on duty, they said they couldn't find our bags. WHAT??? Crazy. They were so rude to us. Don't they know sites like Trip Advisor exist?This did not feel like a 4 star hotel and the service felt like a 1 star hotel. I'm giving it 3 stars because of the location, updates and rooftop bar. But please, consider booking elsewhere. No one should be treated that rudely at a hotel. One additional note: We actually booked through Hotwire - it was our 2nd time using hotwire, and our last. After we booked we found lower rates on Hilton's site. Hotwire didn't care when we pointed it out to them, and the hotel treated us like 2nd class citizens. We were lured by 4 star boutique hotel.

I thought the location - on 26th near 7th Ave - was great, close to the subway, and a short walk from great restaurants and nightspots of lower Manhattan.There was also a great rooftop bar with fantastic views of the city.This place does not the raves of many more well known Manhattan hotels. But the price of those places is easily triple what I paid. This place to me is really undiscovered, great value in the center of Manhattan.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","travelfan725</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",8,4.0

Here are the Pros & Cons so I can let you make up your own mind.Pros:- The room was always very clean & tidy (thank you to the maids)- The staff were always very polite & pleasant (apart from one but will come to that later)- View was excellent (will come on to the issue with room allocation)- Good location- The night security guard was outstanding ! Believe his name was Leon (apologies if I've got your name wrong). He went above & beyond on numerous occasions & was a really smashing helpful guy, thank you !Cons:- Sadly the thing lasting memory I have of this hotel is that there was a mistake with our room bill where some drinks had been added that were not ours. When I brought this up with the girl on reception she tried to make out we were lying & tried to cross examine my partner. How dare she ! We spent a fortune on our holiday & the last thing we would do is try & get out of paying our bill. If I was going to try to get out of paying for something it would have been for the room service where they charged us $57 for two sub standard burgers & chips - Paid extra for a 'city view' room & was initially given a room looking into somebody's office. When I phoned reception they said a city view room isn't guaranteed but they would change our room (if its not guaranteed then how can you charge extra for it ?)- The safe in our room decided to lock us out one morning for some reason. Called reception but they said we would have to wait for a engineer to start work which was fine but we had a early morning train to catch to Washington & all our cash & cards were in the safe ! Got it resolved but only by the skin of our teeth- $15 a day for wifi. Come on guys it used to be free until Hilton took over the hotel- The roof top bar gives the impression of being 'open top' but it wasn't & whilst the view is very good the bar isn't.- Ordered room service as we were pressed for time one evening. An hour later it still hadn't arrived so called down to check its status & they had forgotten our orderThe hotel is a bit hit & miss.

Featuring a rooftop partially open-air bar that overlooks midtown Manhattan, the Hilton is a short walk to Times Square and within longer walking distance (for those who like to explore a city by foot) to Central Park and the excellent shopping of Soho. We booked a Queen Bed High Floor room and, while checked into a not-so-high floor room (overlooking a wall opposite our window) with two double beds (not a queen) after arriving after midnight on the first night, we were put in a more applicable room for the remaining 5 nights after speaking to the front desk. The new room was as-anticipated, however we were not informed about the type of room we were given for night one when we were checked in by the attendant and had to go through the process of moving rooms the following morning, being inconvenienced through no fault of our own.Our (2nd) room was close to the top floor and overlooked the Empire State building: a view worth paying extra for. Including a desk, storage cupboard, safe and tidy modern bathroom (with shower over bathtub), the 'standard' mini fridge was strangely absent. Replaced by a tiny fridge-sized vending machine, there was no way to store food or chill beverages purchased from one of the many nearby stores. Instead, we were restricted to over-priced beer and peanuts-in-a-can. Having nowhere to store fresh fruit from a market casued the fruit to go mouldy within 24 hours, a pity since most travellers know it's nice to not be limited to eggs and pancakes every morning one is in the US of A.The room was made-up each morning but with a little inconsistency. Not all glasswear was replaced/cleaned each day and the coffee station, while welcome (despite it being of the high-wastage 'capsule' variety) was not restocked particularly well. The in-room TV was excellent, providing a guide of what was on every station (making looking for the weather and business channels easier) in addition to other information that was useful. The downstairs restaurant, Rare, was excellent. Serving upscale burgers, amongst other 'grill' fare, the meal had here was great. Pure Americana, a spicy buffalo wings appetizer was finger-lickin' good while gourmet burgers accompanied by a basket full of different types of fries (sweet potato, french, lattice) and their respective dipping sauces were suculent and delicious. Having avoided fast-food burgers prior to visiting Rare, it was a joy to taste a burger crafted by a chef.Overall, this Hilton's best traits lie in its location and newness. Many Manhattan hotels feel tired and while this one continues to feel new, it has that distiction. Being central while not in the dead-centre of touristy Times Square was also good. A walk to Times Square took only 5-10 leasurely minutes, and sites such as the Empire State, the high-line park (a must-see!) were also close-by.

Our room was on the 18th floor and the elevators are fast. It has a roof top bar that you can get a good view of New York.

It's about 12 blocks from the hotel and it was pretty safe to walk back to the hotel from Time Square though. Valet parking is fifty five per day plus 10 per valet call. Every time you call valet to bring your car, they charge you ten dollars extra which I though was crazy. You can self park a couple of blocks down from the hotel into a garage but there it's (I think) fourty five dollars. I think that most all hotels would charge for parking in New York. Next time, I would highly check out other hotels at or very close to Time Square as you can walk out of your hotel and be in the center of everything but be ready for pay for it and that also goes for the resturants around Time Square.

I’m HH Diamond and Marriott Platinum so I’ve spent a fair amount of time in business hotels. I selected September since it's now 12:10AM on 9/1 and the music is still playing.The staff is nice and courteous but that doesn’t make up for the shortcomings.As previously stated the rooms are very small with only showers. I was staying two nights in the middle of the week; I booked a king room on a high floor and upon check-in I asked if there was an upgrade available at which point I was told that I had been upgraded to a king room on a high floor…. Funny since that’s what my reservation was already for. When I got to the room I found a very small (even by large city standards) but clean room with a view directly into the office across the street (17th floor doesn’t come close to clearing the neighboring buildings so the only positive to a higher floor is less traffic noise). I asked about the possibility of getting a view and I was told I should have requested the North side of the hotel. Now I’ve never stayed at this hotel and as a diamond member I usually get decent rooms. I was however told they would move me to a nicer room the next night since the hotel was full for the night. That’s when the problems really started. I was given a room on the 22nd floor with a beautiful view, the problem is that they neglected to tell me that the night club on the roof stays open until at least Midnight and is quite loud on the 22nd floor. Actually very loud, it was loud enough that my wife could hear it over the phone when I called her at 11:30PM because I still couldn’t sleep (earplugs are no defense against R&B and techno since the bass resonates through everything). I called the front desk and I was told that the next time I should request a room that isn’t on the 22nd floor, it’s amazing that they expect the guests to know so much about the hotel before they come (request a north facing room not on the 22nd floor, got it.). I was also advised that since this was Wed night the club would probably be open until 12:30 or 1am and the front desk was nice enough to point out that it must not be bothering anyone else…. Seriously??? I like loud music at clubs as much as the next person but it really sucks when you have an 8am flight. There is no way that they don’t get nightly complaints about this unless they don’t put people on the 22nd floor or everyone that stays here is out till 1am every night.

From first contact, I felt there was nothing that they wouldn’t do for us, and this was carried through by every member of staff we encountered throughout our stay.

The hostess pointed us in the right direction for the Subway.The room was nicely decorated and we weren’t short of space for our bags, clothes and even when we bought stuff, it didn’t clog the room up. The bed was massive and so comfy. The air-con made it easy to keep the room cool enough for us and the black-out blinds meant that the sun wasn’t waking us up.

The lobby has two or three elevators dedicated to guests, and one direct express to the rooftop bar complete with a velvet rope and guestkeeper in a suit. The hotel offers thumbnail-sized cupcakes at the front desk provided by a local bakery. That last feature would could be the hotel's most unique charm, except for the fact that the cupcakes are not always available until after 3 pm. This resulted in a crushing disappointment on two mornings for the three year old member of our party. If she could do math, she would downgrade the hotel by a star or two. The hotel giveth cupcakes (good), but not so much when hotel taketh away. This seems like an insignificant quibble until you experience it with a three year old.

A smile and ""good morning sir!"" would go a long way. This was true of some of the check in staff also.* My room could be quite noisy in the morning, especially with the constant loud slamming of surrounding doors between seven and ten am.* The wireless internet and mini-bar were very expensive and for this kind of rate (about $300 a night), Hilton should look at brands like the Hyatt's Andaz that offer free wireless and water/in-room snacks.Traveler tip - it took me forever to realize that there is no off switch to the bathroom light - it's automatic!

We decided to try it out on the Saturday night before going out (7:30 ish) only to find that it was full so they wouldn't let us go up in the lift. The guy at the lift said he was 'holding the door' which means nothing to me but worked out that you could queue in the reception if you wanted to go up. So never saw what is a selling point for the hotel.","London, United Kingdom","JonSimLondon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",23,4.0
