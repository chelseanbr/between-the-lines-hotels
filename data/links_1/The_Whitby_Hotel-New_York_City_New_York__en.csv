Always upgrade me to a lovely large room where I can both work, sleep and chill out in. Started having breakfast downstairs instead of my room! They always find me a little table tucked away so I can read and people watch! And yes as a staunch Englishman from the north they always bring me brown sauce (if you know you know!)

Nice welcome and a cute little gift with a personalised note in my room, I love it when hotels recognise you like this. All staff were great, as usual. Dark haired lady behind the bar at night and the long haired chap who delivered room service in the morning deserve a mention. Breakfast staff were all so friendly and nothing to much trouble. Room was bright, large and spotlessly clean and the bed, as ever was big and comfortable. My only issue, everyday I ordered room service items were missing, basic things like cups, tea strainer and even items of food and drink, was irritating having to call back down and wait another 15 minutes, especially based on the cost and tray charge.

A lot of stunning interior decorating, eclectic and unique artwork, outstanding service, and unrivaled comfort. Believe it or not, I could not hear the midtown traffic from the bedroom (although in fairness, I was a bit distracted by the stunning details I was paying my attention to). We originally had a standard suite but was upgraded to the executive suite. (For the Americans reading this - it rivaled any exceptional Million Dollar Listing: New York property - I felt like a star!) Multiple bedrooms, bathrooms, even living rooms! Little touches such as heated marble bathroom floors (a must during winters in the NE), marble walls, stainless steel appliances, really added to the notion that we weren’t just at any luxury hotel. Each room in the entire hotel - from the restaurant and bar to the foyers outside the elevator bays - held unique art. Even the walls throughout the hotel had padded fabrics on them. It was as if Kit Kemp herself walked every inch of the building and personally designed it with her own eyes. Who knows, perhaps she did. And it’s outstanding. Let’s not discount the staff - gorgeous, friendly (but not stiff or sterile like other luxury hotel staff can be sometimes), vibrant and gracious.The entire experience was one of a kind and I cannot recommend it enough.","Chicago, Illinois","askb0</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",2,5.0

We wanted to stay at a nice hotel near Central Park and after researching multiple options we decided on The Whitby Hotel. It was definitely the right choice!The only difficult part was finding the hotel. We drove past it the first time and and to circle back around. The entrance is rather unassuming and there is construction (of course there is in NYC) going on across the street. The staff is extremely helpful with your luggage and valet of your vehicle. Check-in was quick and easy. We stayed in a Junior Suite, which was perfect. The room was on the 6th floor with a street view (nothing to see here but the construction across the street). You're not really going to get views in this hotel, but that wasn't a big deal. I'd rather go walk around the city to get the views. The room is a good size. The bathroom has a soaking tub, a TV mounted in the wall by the tub, some automatic lights (helpful at night), a toilet, two sinks and a shower. The hotel is stylish in a very cool way with a mix of contemporary and traditional decor. The beds were comfortable and the room was surprisingly quiet. The Whitby bar/restaurant is great as well. Healthy breakfast options and great service. The gym was also a nice surprise. We were expecting very limited equipment and for a boutique hotel it was very good. You can definitely do strength training and cardio with what they have to offer. Overall, a great stay and we will be back. Kudos to the staff -- all very helpful and pleasant.

I’m not sure what it was that made me peer inside the window of The Whitby Bar, but I’m so glad I did! Immediately I told my friend, we are going inside to take a look. The decor is what lured me in! It was like an eclectic look between Europe and New Orleans. I later found out the interior is designed by the owner Kit Kemp who is know for her stylish and witty interiors. Exactly! We asked for a little tour of the restaurant and saw a few young women having a tea party in back! The seating is all sofas and soft cushy chairs. We asked to see the dinner menu and canceled our reservations at Stk for dinner and booked a reservation here! We arrived full of excitement! The service was impeccable! The host Mr. Hunter sent over two glasses of champagne to help us celebrate my Birthday! Nice touch! Our waiter Carlos was a gem! He was polite! Offered suggestions when asked, came to the table at the exact perfect moments to ask if we needed anything. The food was spectacular! We both had the burrata salad, so fresh and the balsamic vinegar was def of high quality! The bread, the butter, the water, the presentation was superb! For dinner we both had the NY Beef Filet... best I’ve had at any high end steak house! For dessert they send over a beautiful cupcake with a candle in it for my Birthday! That cupcake was amazing! We also ordered the blueberry pie with a dollop of ice cream and the best cafe latte I’ve ever had except for when I was in Cuba! After dinner we asked for a tour of the hotel! They had a beautiful library themed space for parties, a theater with red leather seats!! The bathrooms were something out of an Alice and Wonderland storybook! I asked to see the rooms but they were fully booked! I will one day spend a night at this hotel! No doubt about it!

Stewart, Holly, Tess and Katie are just a few of the brilliant managers, and Kathrin the General Manager took time herself to come and chat with us. The entire team really made our stay!The quality of design and decor are incredible, and it is worth spending some time to look at the detail of the many fabrics, finishes and art throughout.The rooms are the best that we have found yet, with more than you would expect from most other five star hotels. Every room is unique, but nicely similar in terms of key features. We noted that the furniture fabrics and other details were different in in each, but the rooms share a very relaxing and comfortable feel.The bathroom suite and finishes are superb, with Kit Kemp (the Owner’s) own brand of shampoo and moisturiser.The bar and restaurant are perfectly sized for the hotel, and the atmosphere tends to be really nice, with a mix of residents and business people in at breakfast and dinner times. The bar looks great, and has a fantastic offering, and the food and service levels absolutely exceptional.

Having stayed for almost a week, it has by far been one of THE BEST hotel stays we ever had! Where to start... It began with the simple and highly personalized reservation process, where the reception guided us on room/suite options and the ideal set up for us. Upon arrival, we were greeted by name (throughout the stay by every team member) and were touched by the many details at the hotel...the art, the design, the amenities, the generous fruit basket and water in the room, the personalized and handwritten card by General Manager Kathrin and sooo much more!The views on 56th street are wonderful and the floor to ceiling windows make it even more inspiring and give it a great urban feel. We do live in Dubai, so feeling NYC and its energy 24/7 whilst being in NYC was amazing! We also liked the gym a lot with its top state of the art equipment, the very high res screens with business news on and the muesli bars. Talking food and snack, breakfast ist phenomenal and my personal favorite was the avo toast and the fresh berries and bircher muesli :) Another ""hidden gem"" is the hotel""s ""honesty bar"", a library style like lounge in top privacy and comfort, to enjoy a drink or coffee, doing emails and/or focus work or read. Another highlight of our stay was a) the amazing concierge team who helped us out with our daily excursions and restaurant arrangements and the very hands on- and always present General Manager Ms Kathrin, who even offered us a house tour.In brief, a very wonderful stay, super amazing team, great location - VERY WELL DONE everyone and we will be back soon!",United Arab Emirates,"Daniel W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United Arab Emirates</strong>",60,5.0

But if you’re looking for a centrally located hotel that makes you feel at home away from home, this is it. I had a cozy and clean room at the back, which meant no view, but absolutely no noise either. Beautiful, super comfortable bed, spacious bathroom with a large shower that worked impeccably (no need to fumble with various knobs just to be splashed with either cold or boiling hot water), super quiet A/C, large closet with plenty of hangers — everything you need in a hectic city that never sleeps. The concierge and the doormen were extremely friendly and helpful (thank you, Todd and staff!), which also helped made me feel comfortable and at home. The street has various restaurants, nail salons, small grocery shops, delis, hair salons etc., so you are only a few steps away from most of the things you might need, while the 5th Avenue designer shops are just round the corner. The subway station on 57th street is currently under renovation, so you have to walk a few more blocks to get on the subway. Also, since Trump Tower is just round the corner, the whole street might be barricaded when the President is in the city.The restaurant, however, is a different matter. Although beautifully and creatively decorated and absolutely inviting, it left much to be desired. If you ask for a glass of sparkling water, you get a liter bottle for eight dollars (even when you eat a tiny continental breakfast for $25 consisting of a minuscule quantity of butter, one kind of jam and two slices of toast plus a bit of yoghurt, fruit and nuts - the müsli and berries containers were and stayed empty). The wait staff were neither attentive nor forthcoming and displayed a somewhat superior attitude. After two similar experiences, I decided to have breakfast elsewhere, especially since the buffet offers a disappointingly small selection of items (not even regular cereals).","Luxor, Egypt","504lilianah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Luxor, Egypt</strong>",51,5.0

There is all that. Yet, as my subsequent stay at the Crosby Street Hotel (same company) showed, all that counts for little without the staff that can make the place feel special ... because they make you feel special.As a frequent hotel guest it is all too easy to forget that staff are people, but if you don’t .... well, then you might find that they bend over backwards for you because they care about how you feel in their place. You may not notice it immediately, but you do over time, and you do when it is not there.Hospitality at the Whitby is taken seriously, from the time you arrive and Kevin checks you in with that barely suppressed broad grin that seems to hide a giddy enthusiasm for meeting people, to the time you have to leave and Ivan sprints around the block to get you a cab quickly.In between, Katie welcomes you cheerfully at 7am for breakfast when your body clock tells you it’s 2am, and then picks you up and gets you going. Fatou, will serve you with efficient professionalism, accompanied by a warm smile ... and she will know, within a day, what you want to order before you do.If you come for drinks or dinner, you will meet interesting guests and locals at the bar, where Nicky knows that an Amaretto Sour is best served “up”, and deftly directs the traffic at the counter when she’s not busy with one of her wondrous libations. Boys and girls will get distracted when Keshia serves cocktails and sets hearts aflutter with her shy smile.In amongst the busy activity of an evening’s full house or Sunday brunch, you will find Sydney, who seems to have hospitality in her blood ... and in her soul. She makes sure that everyone is looked after, and she will make you feel as though you are an old friend, whom she has the privilege to welcome in her own home. Things at the Whitby happen around you, they just work in the way they should ... and in the rare instance that they don’t, they get fixed immediately and graciously. Sadly, such hospitality is a rare thing these days - it’s engagement that is not obsequious, it is attention that is discreet yet constant, it is the little things that people don’t have to do, but do because they evidently care about you not as a customer, but as a guest in their home. Well done everyone, your passion and commitment shows, and it is the reason why this is such a special place!","London, United Kingdom","Sunrider88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",13,5.0

We first discovered Firmdale when we stayed at the Soho Hotel in London in 2010. We very much like their hotels because their design makes guests feel very much at home and their service is always very personable. The Whitby does not disappoint! It is a brand new hotel less than a year old. We stayed there in connecting luxury rooms for 5 nights. It was a wonderful home away from home. Each time we'd come and go, we would be greeted by staff at the reception, concierge and doorman. Previous 2 visits to New York we had stayed at the Four Seasons but it is larger hotel so you always feel like a stranger. The Whitby was a huge difference if you are looking for a much more cosy and comfortable stay. Room - every room has unique furnishing and that's the best part about the Whitby. Getting back into the room after a day out is always a welcome relief. The bathroom is large with dual basins and a bidet like all other Firmdale hotels. The large windows are great as light gets into the room even if you are on the lower floors. I think what's missing in all Firmdale hotels is the coffee/tea in the room. There were chocolates and cookies every day in our room which is a fantastic touch. The walk in shower is also amazing but only suites have baths at the Whitby.Restaurant/Bar - beautiful orangery adjacent to the main part of the restaurant. It features illuminated porcelain pots with various NY landmarks etched onto them. The Whitby breakfast with buffet was very good and coffee is excellent (not the usual American coffee)Gym - very well equipped and big for a hotel of this size. Location - the hotel is very well located in upper midtown. Walking distance to Times Square, 5th Ave, Central Park .. if we needed to go anywhere farther, we would get an Uber or taxi. When coming from the airport, our taxi driver dropped us off on 5th Ave at corner of W 56th, but you can insist they drop you off in front of the hotel because they just have to drive down W 55th then loop back to W 56th. The hotel is close to all kinds of restaurants and on W 56th there are many small eateries. There is also a Bread & Butter opposite the hotel. We can't wait to go back to New York to the Whitby.

I have stayed at several other Firmdale Hotels and, like them, The Whitby gives painstaking attention to ensuring that its guests are comfortably delighted at every turn. The wee floor lights that twinkle as the elevator doors open, the whimsical but carefully curated artwork in the public areas, the elegant but fun colours and fabrics of the rooms and the fact that everything works add up to an experience that justifies the price. Delicious breakfasts in the morning and cocktails with bar snacks were prepared and presented in the pretty and swank bar area or the gorgeous conservatory with friendly professionalism. Service was swift and low-key...umbrellas offered when the rains came, an extra night’s accommodation in the same room due to a weather-induced flight cancellation organized with an unasked-for extension of the weekend rate without missing a beat. Although I love Firmdale’s The Crosby for its unsurpassed Soho location, The Whitby is a great choice for anyone who wants to be within easy reach of Broadway, Fifth Avenue and Central Park. This makes it, in my book, the #1 choice for a first-time visitor to New York City who wants to be in a quiet location but close to the action.

They are cool boutique hotels that never sacrifice comfort, luxury, beauty and service in their hipness.We actually live in NYC but every once in awhile we need the magic and romance of a fabulous hotel. Having spent Christmas and some other occasions at the Firmdale’s other NYC property, The Crosby Street Hotel, and loved it, we were keen to try the new midtown Whitby which we did on my birthday weekend in July. Work kept us in the country for my birthday this year, and since it is so near the 4th of July local travel just wouldn’t do.We opted for the Whitby where the gracious GM, Kathrin Apitz, upgraded us to a fabulous suite with a terrace. I was gifted with champagne and delicious treats and some great Kit Kemp (Firmdale’s founder) products for face and body and her famous room and linen spray that makes you just want to shove your face into your pillow and risk smothering.The people who work at the Whitby are smilers but not in that obnoxious “I will be your server” kind of way. They are actually interested in making you happy and so you are ,and so everybody is happy! What a concept! As an organizational psychologist I can attest that Firmdale is on to something with their training. From Stuart, the charming Scottish restaurant manager, to Robert at the desk, and Fatou, the best waitress anywhere, anytime, you will be well taken care of. As I write this, I know I will have more trouble finding a room at the Whitby now, and probably will never get another upgrade because other people are also discovering the Whitby’s charms (and celebs love it – recent citings include Anne Hathaway and Judi Dench), I still have to share because it is the right thing to do. PS Had lunch at the Whitby yesterday after being away all the rest of the summer and it was like I had never left.

This means the road is completely closed to traffic at random and the staff will refuse to help you with luggage. Why? New York City does not require employees to tell you what is happening outside of their four, compressed walls. There are 24 hour a day protests (noisy) and a heavy Secret Service presence. Thinking that was the worst of it, it was not. We booked the room for six nights and after disregarding the barrier, driving up on a sidewalk to get in and taking luggage out of the car ourselves, we were greeted by a staff that was badly trained and unhelpful. They seemed dazed, confused, and put us in a room that had construction going on above us. We left within 16 hours.The management IS NOT indicative of the Firmdale Hotel group, nor of the dozens of top notch hotels in New York.

We ordered room service twice and both times orders were incorrect and/or items missing and there was never any attempt to compensate or credit us in any way, staff also knocking on door way too often for various things, broken DVD player in our room which was supposed to be replaced but wasn't, and lastly, but to me most telling is that I dropped my sweater in room on way out to airport. I called and asked if they had it and they did indeed. Unlike most high end hotels that immediately ship items to you, the concierge sent me paperwork to fill out and they are charging for shipping and a $10 ""hotel fee"". When you've spent over $2,000 at a hotel for 2 nights I'd think they could ship a small item without charging and acting like they're doing you a favor.

Here, everyone from housekeeping, restaurant/bar staff, front desk, and bellman, were outstanding.

Bathroom was large, double vanities, and good lighting. Great place to relax after meetings, getting ready for a dinner or show, and relaxing on thee weekend.Common areas - Very comfortable and inviting. There is a library with an honor bar to relax in for a post show drink. The lobby, hallways, and rooms have great art.

Beautifully decorated, comfortable well appointed rooms with lovely amenities. The lobby, dining rooms and bar are really well done and could not be more charming. Unfortunately the service in the bar and the dining room is far below the expectations set by the beauty of the facility. On our first night after returning from the theater we went to the bar for a nightcap. There were very few people, four at the bar, one table of three, and one table of four. There were three barmen and what appeared to be a manager. We sat at the bar and watched for nearly 15 minutes as the staff engaged in what appeared to be a lively and fun conversation at the opposite end of the bar. After staring at them for some time I finally caught the eye of the Manager and gestured that we would like to order some drinks. He immediately sent the bartender our way and also approached us asking for our order. Hardly a great level of service. On our last morning we went to the dining room for breakfast. It is a beautiful space. again, like the bar two nights before it was not crowded. After being seated we were presented with menu's and asked for drink orders. 10 minutes later our coffee arrived and we placed our orders. 35 minutes later pour food arrived, barely above room temperature and one order missing one of the three items ordered. This is not how a luxury hotel dining room should be treating it's patrons.

My husband would have loved also some bidet size towels, but this is just an Italian thing.The beautiful chrome heated towel rail is enormous therefore the bathroom was very warm which doesn't happen often in hotels and it's annoying.The corner Junior Suite with private terrace was so spacious and beautiful one would love to move in for good. The windows are so big it's a pleasure to have the curtains always open. The skyscrapers around should be offices so people in there are supposed to work not to look inside your room (and I don't really care to be honest).The staff service remained impeccable also during breakfast. The menu was offering only The Whitby breakfast to include buffet and an hot dish while my husband wanted to go for the American breakfast, so our waitress very kindly suggested that we could hand the buffet included aswell. The breakfast buffet is incredibly stylingly displayed I have to say. Croissants and cereals table with no table cloth so to show the beautiful smooth wood, very minimal. We needed two bowls for yogurt and we found literally only two bowls between the croissants. One minute after other two bowls appeared for other guests who might need them too. I would have loved to see a larger choice. Smoked salmon or some simple fresh cakes for example. The pain au chocolat was really really delicious and huge though. I won't mention the decor as it's clearly illustrated in the pictures on the website. However the breakfast room with the skylight on a sunny day feels like the Garden of Eden. The green plants in the marble fountain (?) were so shiny that I had to touch them to find out they were not fake (which I wouldn't expect to find in a Firmdale property in a thousands years).Room was spotlessly cleaned and after we came back one afternoon soaking wet due to the heavy rain we placed our wet clothes over the bathroom heater removing the large towels. I was actually wondering where the housekeeping would have placed them after the turndown service. I was happy to challenge their creativity. Once back in the room they were nicely folded and hung on the beautiful bathtub. Very nicely thought. The attention to detail is much appreciated as it makes your stay smoother and effortless. Can't wait to be back!","London, United Kingdom","NathanNate</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",3,5.0

First of all, the hotel is in a fabulous location from which to explore the city, whether on foot, Uber or subway. The room decor is scrumptious! Every detail is well thought out with plenty of places to charge your phone/tablet, logical lighting, well planned closet and large windows to bring the light in but sufficently block out noise of the city. I could write an entire paragraph on the virtues of the very generously sized bathroom but suffice it to say that the shower is perfection, lighting plentiful, towels substantial, and mirrors in just the right place. The public areas are top notch as well. The bar and dining area is comfortable with a vibrant energy without a decibel level that precludes socializing. The menu selection provides plenty of choices of delicious dishes. The front desk staff offer a warm welcome and are the keepers of your room key which is such a lovely tradition. As much as the physical attributes of the hotel are sure to wow you, it is the staff that really give the Whitby its heart. The concierge staff are incredibly patient with all the same questions that they must be asked a thousand times a day. They are quick with a restaurant recommendation, assistance with theater tickets, transportation needs, etc.. The staff at the door are incredibly friendly and engaging and don't limit their interactions to ""can I get you a cab"" or ""welcome back"". They seemed genuinely interested in us as guests with an inquiry about what our plans were for the day and even remembered where we had been and asked how we liked the show or dinner. Coming back to The Whitby each day feels like coming to our home away from home and we are certainly looking forward to our next visit! Thank you to everyone who made our visit so wonderful!","Los Angeles, California","DebB818</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",52,5.0

I ate only breakfast in the hotel but the traditional English breakfast was as good as it gets in America. Despite it being a very ""cool"" boutique hotel, the lobby was professional and not overrun. This hotel will never be cheap, but for a traveler who needs quiet efficiency, friendly faces willing to help, the highest quality food, and appreciates being surrounded in style, this is one of the rare hotels that delivers it all on a plate.

They are relaxing yet invigorating because of all the spectacular fabrics and artwork. There is nothing like them...Anywhere. Great bathrooms. Great gym.

The new Firmdale hotel, the Whitby, keeps up the great quality and ambience of the Crosby but is different so as to fit the neighborhood. It is located near all the shops, the center of NYC. I love how you enter the rooms off the little hallways, giving you a privacy feeling that you don't have at other hotels. The staff is as always, so accommodating. The decor is so warm and friendly. I stayed in a wonderfully warm-colored room that made me feel to so cozy. The little touches that are done when decorating the rooms adds so much I wish I could be that creative with my own home. It is within walking distance of so many great shops. Sometimes it gets a little crazy with Trump tower down the street but it just comes and goes. It also adds to the character of the hotel.I can't say enough about how great this hotel is. The Whitby and Crosby have ruined me for staying at all other sterile hotels. I recently stayed at an unnamed 'boutique hotel' and it was so bland.

After opening only a short while ago, it's clear the team here already has it down. The product came across as fine tuned and thoughtful and the service felt genuine and warm. My girlfriend and I love being secret shoppers and as such, we can't help but dig into the details. After West, our wide-smiled, graceful bellman showed us to our suite, we did what we always do: look around. The room was immaculate, not a smudge on the windows or mirrors; bold, but tastefully designed, and most importantly, every tiny detail had been considered. Personalized, hand-written welcome note, a TV with surround sound in the bathroom, a beautiful Tivoli radio right out of MoMa and a bed that was nothing other than heavenly.The revitalization of midtown takes a big step forward with The Whitby as it's crown jewel.

The hotel opened fairly recently and it seemed not all rooms were even finished. Our two rooms had nice designs in the typical Firmdale fashion. Maybe they were a bit more sterile than what one are used to in London, but even so they were luxurious and immaculately clean. The Whitby bar, The Orangerie and the Drawing room are all lavishly designed and we especially enjoyed the Orangiere which is both filled with light and cosy. Breakfast was good although a bit inconsistent. The American pancakes being much larger and ""lusher"" the first two mornings of our stay. The fruit buffet was very good. But again the buffet setting is just a bit more ""clinical"" than what you are used to from Ham Yard, Dorset Square and the other London sisters. For example it would have been nice with some whole fruits like plums and peaches and some different types of youghurt. But I am sure this will evolve going forward.Service is still a bit inconsistent and our tea the first evening did never appear and the fire alarm went off two days without anyone making an apology.

This is by far one of the best new hotels in New York City it's absolutely fabulous! It's downtown meets midtown as the design is nothing like this neighborhood has seen. This I a beautiful Firmdale property so each room has been designed by the owner herself which is a huge rarity this day and age. They have a great gym in the basement with top of the line equipment and it's nice and airy. The restaurant serves up delicious entrees and the service was so good. They have a drawing room (very English) right off the lobby and then they have one downstairs for their in house guests only and it was so cozy! The word cozy doesn't usually go along with a huge bustling city like New York so it was completely unexpected and allow for pure relaxation from the hustle. The bed was perfect I slept like a kitten. When I woke the next morning I jumped in the shower and the water pressure was super powerful. Enjoy this amazing gem you are all going to be glad to make this your new hotel in the city! Oh I forgot to mention the staff they were hands down so nice and warm and accommodating and they were so happy to have me as their guest at the hotel and that made me feel extremely special and even more proud to stay there! My tip to you is to book one of the corner rooms with a terrace as having that outdoor space in the city was a huge added value. Good luck Whitby and much success to everyone at Firmdale on your new adventure!,"Los Angeles, California","chad_11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",26,5.0
