This hotel did an outstanding job with service. I can't recommend the concierge services enough: from knowing the neighborhoods in Tokyo, making reservations in a timely manner, speaking conversational English, and giving out clear and concise directions. The hotel is located right in the middle of Roppongi which is an expat neighborhood in the heart of Tokyo. The hotel connects to the mall and is within short walking distance to the Tokyo metro subway gray line and some great local restaurants. The location was definitely convenient to getting around to different areas in Tokyo. The common areas of the hotel are very well maintained and eye catching. I especially liked the gym/spa/pool area. While the pool isn't as flashy as some of the other hotels in Tokyo, it is still quite nice. The spa was also free to use and had amazing massage chairs in the rest area. I was slightly disappointed in the room but I can't blame the hotel for this. The hotel was completely full for the enthronement ceremony and the Rugby World Cup so they placed me on a low floor. There was no view whatsoever, but surprisingly the room was still pretty quiet even with the close proximity to the street. The room itself felt a little too 90s decor and probably could use a refresh. However, it was very clean, spacious, and well laid out. The breakfast at the hotel seemed a little hit or miss to me. I had decided to try the breakfast after reading the glowing reviews and I felt somewhat let down. I think for the price point the buffet breakfast should have had more variety offerings. The quality was top notch, but it just seemed like the spread was sparse for the price (I believe it was around $55 USD per head). I would probably eat outside of the hotel unless you are Diamond. One tip if you are coming from Narita or Haneda: the limo bus drops you off directly at the hotel. I thought this was super convenient instead of taking the NEX and then transferring to a taxi or subway. I would definitely consider staying at this property again.","San Francisco, California","climbwithahelmet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",136,5.0
