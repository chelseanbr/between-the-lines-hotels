It’s a good hotel in a great location, a world away from the noise and mess of mid and north Manhattan, with some good bars and restaurants close by.The best thing about the hotel, however, are the staff. All of them we’re incredibly polite and helpful, but I do have to single out one person in particular for praise. I believe the lady’s name was Michel. My wife and I cannot thank her enough for her help. When our pre-booked ride to the airport failed to turn up she got straight on the phone and took no nonsense from the person on the other end, who was insistent that the car had been parked outside for 45 minutes - it had actually gone to the wrong hotel.She even took the license plate number and went outside to flag the car down. To the manager/owner of the hotel, make sure you keep hold of your current employees, particularly Michel. Staff like her are worth their weight in gold to your business.","Newport, Wales, United Kingdom","AndyJ-Aggius</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newport, Wales, United Kingdom</strong>",3,4.0

There's also a small kitchen with a fridge, microwave, coffee maker, and sink. The floor was a bit cracked in the kitchen. There are windows in the bedroom, a small tv but the remote controller was not working and the tv was not working as well. The bed was a decent size for two but somehow we found a few bugs on the bed, not bed bugs coz we didn't experience any for the two nights we stayed here.The BathroomThe bathroom was a decent size. There's a bathtub but wouldn't recommend to use them looks dirty with stain probably because is old. The water pressure could use some more. There is a hairdryer.Restaurant/EntertainmentThere is a restaurant since they offer a breakfast buffet in the morning but we didn't try them since it's New York! gotta do the local stuff!Hotel Service/AmenitiesThey have free wifi in the room but the wifi was very slow. They also do baggage service.OverallNot sure would come back here again to stay. The hotel is doing partly renovation when we were there not sure if they're doing renovation for the whole hotel or just some part of the hotel.

But, you (like me) booked it on Hotwire; thus, there's no turning back now, so you might as well enjoy it.The rooms were fine and at one time nice, but they've been well lived in and the attempts at fixing what small cosmetic issues they have, are rather lacklustre. The hotel has a lot of potential were the owners to throw some money at it, and I think the 3.5 star rating is not wildly inaccurate, but about a half a star too many.It is an average hotel in an average location, but it has a really good price. You're saving money on the resort fees that all other NYC hotels charge you and, let's be honest, you chose it because of the price, so there's not much to complain about.The bed was comfy and the pillows nice, and I was pleasantly surprised by both the size of my room, and its solitude from the street below. Overall, I was neither displeased, nor blown away, and for a hotel at this price point, I think that's a very honourable delivery. Don't go in with high expectations, but don't be worried either. It's an average place and you're an average person, so just put your ego aside and accept what you paid for; you might just find (like I did) that you like the place for all its little quirks.

The hotel is of a human dimension which is rare in NY. Only 6 floors and 10-12 rooms by floor. The staff was extremely kind and helpful with a special thanks to Jorge who has always taken very good care of us regardless it was related to door keys not working, finding a restaurant or taking care of our luggage’s. The rooms are very large, very well furbished and daily cleaning was just outstanding. The bedding is of high quality which is very important for us given our age and related comfort requirements. We also tested once the breakfast offer and we were very positively surprised of the quality and diversity of the food.

Although most things are in working order (not so the disabled lift in reception!!), one can feel that this hotel has seen better days. We did not like that we had to climb a short stairs to reach reception, dragging our luggage along (reception staff do help when they are not busy with another guest). We also did not like the split levels within our guestroom, but understand that the architecture of this period building may limit what can be done...

So...rather than go uptown to parade immediately we checked bags in and went down the street for lunch. Came back to hotel at 205 to freshen up and head to parade. We could tell as soon as we walked in the clerk forgot about us bc he didn't look up or make any eye contact. At that point we were afraid that if we left that we would return to wrong room type etc. So we then spent another hour waiting for our ""early check-in"" in a lobby. We finally were checked in by clerk who took over for him...at 3:15. If he had just told us no early check-in we would have dropped our stuff and headed uptown. We missed the whole parade and our catacombs tour because of this. Months of plans and wasted money. The room was very nice, spacious. Suited 3 of us well...finally.

However, since in NYC everything is sensibly more expensive than the standard US prices, I would say that you're paying a competitive price for a good location.

Lobby clean. Front desk staff, nice and knowledgable. Lobby restrooms clean. Now the rooms....the elevator is a little rough looking from usage. The hallways are painted a dark brown, which is not a good choice for interior walls. No carpeting to lighten it up. Our room, 503, was directly across from the elevator but whether we were lucky or what we never heard a peep from the hallway. The rooms are in great need of renovation. The Pergo like flooring of our room was lifting at the corners. The queen bed had a headboard for a king. Only two pillows, no extra blankets. Only one bath towel in the bathroom. The vanity is begging to be replaced. The sink plumbing is reversed with hot on the right and cold on the left. Toilet is eco friendly and the walls are tiled so those are the thumbs up. The luggage stand is broken and tilts precariously. There are holes in the wall from some a holder or something that needs to be patched and repainted. There is no other chair in the room other than at the desk in the room so if one wants to read it is either on the bed, in the desk chair or on the floor. I understand this hotel is busy but they won't be seeing quality guests if they do not put some time and money into getting this hotel fixed. The flag out front of the hotel needs to be replaced as it is faded and doesn't represent the hotel well at all.

My son attends a nearby college, and I am so happy to have found a great place to visit in the FiDi. Pros: - For me, location. If you want to be in the Financial District, this is a nice choice. One block from the East River. Just 3-4 minute walk from the subway. - It's really really clean. I am a little neurotic about this kind of thing, and I took apart the bedding to check for anything unmentionable. The bedding, mattress, and mattress cover looked very new. My room had flooring, not carpet, so there was no ""musty smell"" as I've seen in other reviews. The restaurant area was also extremely clean. - Lobby has a small but comfy sitting area.- We were upgraded to a small suite. Sweet! - Our views were of busy Wall Street area hustle & bustle. Very pleasant to look out on all the NYC hubbub.- Price was quite reasonable.- Suite included small living room and full (small) equipped kitchen.Cons:- Furnishing seemed quite spartan in the living room area of the suite. However, since the upgrade to suite was free, I am not complaining!! Just a heads-up to future guests.- Front Street is not a lovely block. You just need to know this and not expect a picturesque street. It's more convenient than attractive. However the river walk area, one block away, is quite nice for a stroll.I would stay here again. For me, wanting a FiDi location, it's a great choice.

There was no housekeeping staff so we had to change the sheets ourselves. We also asked for extra pillows which came up 2 days later. There is no room service and no onsite restaurant ( it will open next month). They do serve breakfast until 10 a.m. The towels are pretty bad and there are stains on the floor. I would also recommend bringing your own shampoo, conditioner and soap as these were not replenished daily. The really odd thing that happened on the last night there was: we went to walk to a little market nearby and there were like 50 used condoms on the side of the building -_-. We were traveling with my 16 year old so that was a little awkward to explain. On the other hand, as i mentioned before the staff was great!. very helpful extremely nice.

Only the lobby was okay, but the moment you stepped into the elevator and onto the corridors, it was definitely not a four star hotel. It was outdated with a heavy musty/moldy smell. The room itself was not clean and also falling apart. I agree with another reviewer that it looked like a beat up dorm room that had a quick fix up. The hotel room we stayed at had a weird layout. The room opened up to a small narrow hallway that lead up to the rest of the room.The leather couch in the living area had no support, we sank right in. The fake wooden vinyl floor was sticky and dirty. There were lints/hairballs so large and stuck under the room door. The handles/door looked like they were about to fall apart anytime, we were not quite sure if we could sleep safely at night. The bathroom faucet was wobbly and the cabinet was so badly water damaged that you could see all the pressed wood expanded from within. Overall the room was just not clean and not up to a four star hotel like it claims.We really didn't have to be observant for any of the above mentioned and we actually tried not to be so we wouldn't get more grossed out by it.

We did not know what to expect as we were not acquainted with the Eurostars brand. I must say we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel was located right smack in the middle of the financial district, which made it a lively atmosphere during the week (dead on the weekend), with vendors, foodtrucks and people galore. There is good shopping and eateries nearby and the pier is right there for those interested. Parking was a big issue, but hello, we are in NYC. If you found street parking at night (which we did every night in front of the hotel) we were good until morning when we had to feed the meter. Trust me the cops would be there waiting to write that ticket.The hotel......upon entering, it was clean and very inviting. They did a good job decorating the lobby to make guests feel welcomed. The lobby is small, so not really a place for socializing. The rooms were spacious and clean. Our room had 2 double beds and a sofa that converted into a bed. There were 5 of us that stayed in there and apart from us having to share one bathroom, it was pretty comfortable for us all. The bathroom left more to be desired from. It was a bit shabby and needed some TLC. It looked as if the bathroom was in the middle of being renovated and they forgot and booked that room. However, it was clean enough to not gross anyone out. The room came outfitted with a coffee maker, microwave, small fridge, desk, chair, alarm clock/radio and television with the relevant channels. Overall, it was a good stay here and I would stay here again if I ever had the opportunity.....hopefully the bathroom would be in better shape by then :-)","Dallas, Texas","JayG-0909</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",14,3.0

I was visiting my office in the Wall Street area and my company paid for me to stay here. Overall, not a bad stay, but this place does need some improvements. Here are my thoughts:The staff: Overall, excellent!! I received great service from their front desk staff and housekeeping. I enjoyed interacting with them all and by the time I left I felt like I had a new set of friends in the city.The rooms: HUGE! My room was gigantic. Just a couple of things, though. It needs updating. The fixtures in the bathroom were worn and breaking. My shower head was loose and didn't have any pressure. The toilet seat was about to fall off all week and was never fixed. The cheap fixtures (bathroom cabinet, bed table) were badly damaged and chipped. The floor was also warped and some of the flooring was peeling up.HUGE PET PEEVE: NO HDTV!!! What kind of a hotel doesn't have and HDTV these days? The limited channels and lack of HD really ticked me off. The channels were fuzzy most of the time and were barely watchable. This MUST be fixed! SECOND PET PEEVE: No temperature control. The A/C only goes to 68. For most people, this would be fine. But, I prefer it to be around 60 degrees at night for a comfortable sleep. Couple of bonuses: FREE wifi and the location (right off of Wall St). Overall, this place got the job done. With a few major improvements, it could easily have earned a five star rating from me. I think next time I'll stay at the Holiday Inn express across the street for the free breakfast.","Boston, Massachusetts","WClarke84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",26,3.0

I'd been met with a warm welcome and told that I'd been given a free upgrade. So far so good. However, after tossing and turning all night because of the street noise (it's a block away from the West Road - very noisy) and the bright lights coming into the room because the curtains didn't close in the middle, I found that in the cold light of day the room wasn't as good as I had first thought. The duvet was very badly stained and it made me feel unclean to think that I'd slept under it. The bathroom furniture has been badly damaged by water and is warped and the laminate coating is splitting. I complained about the duvet and was met with a 'what happened?' response. What happened was that a dirty duvet was left on my bed!Next morning, the w.c. blocked and was unusable. I went back to the room at lunch time to ensure that it'd been cleared and, thankfully it had. The dripping sink tap had also been replaced, which I hadn't complained about, so that was a bonus. Additionally, the paintwork in the room is badly scuffed and marked and the tv only had good reception on a couple of channels. I handed in a feedback card 5 days ago, requesting that someone made contact with me. So far, no one has, so I am voicing my opinions in this way. This was once a lovely hotel, I'm sure. Right now, though, it needs a renovation and some tlc.I've given it a '2' because it is in a good location if you want to be in the FiDi and my complaints were dealt with promptly, however, they are complaints that should never have arisen in the first place.

The free laptop and a printer at the business center with free gourmet coffee constantly flowing came in handy for the paperwork I had to do. No breakfast was included, though. Internet speed was too slow so I had to use my own portable Wi-Fi. But, what a location! A bloc away from the shoreline: Seaport. You can take the cruise, jog around and spend time at the nearby Seaport shopping area. I loved Dim Sum at a Chinese restaurant within 10 minutes of walking distance. If you love the sauna like I do, you have to check out Wall Street Bath & Sauna. Of course, like the name, you got Wall Street within a stone's throw and all the subway stations within short walking distance. We are from L.A. where ""no body walks"" but I loved walking around here. Exhilarating! Sea of people and the constant humming of sounds! Everything you need and want naturally appear out of nowhere around this hotel. New York is just great. It is teeming with people, life and all-day non-stop attractions. This hotel, at such a nice price, can provide you with a comfortable stay, especially given its extremely convenient location. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, really.

I roll my luggage down Wall St, and hang a left onto Front Street. As I get close to where I thought Eurostars is, I see an awning that says ""Hotel Wall Street"". There was a flag over it, but it was wound up (probably in shame). I finally noticed the faint writing on the window that said ""Eurostars"". I went in the door, and noticed that there are stairs up to the lobby (not the most accessible, but that is the least of their problems). I got 1/2 way up the stairs before, what I assume was the bellhop, got up from the couch and 1/2 pretended to offer help. Now let me say that I stayed here before a long time ago. The bed was so hard, it was like sleeping on the floor. I had to ask for extra pillows, and they ended up bringing me another comforter, which I doubled and slept on top of. Well, this time I saw that they had ""updated"" the hotel, which I hoped had included the beds. Nope. The next morning I mentioned how hard the beds were. The guy at the front desk said ""really?"" like he had never heard that before. Really insulting. He then said ""All of our beds are the same, there shouldn't be a problem."" Then, in a complete contradiction he offered to move me to another room. I then asked the obvious question ""If all the beds are the same, how will that help?"" I asked him to send up extra pillows, so I could sleep on them. He said he would. That night, no pillows. Whatever. I was in town for work, and didn't have time to deal with crappy hotel service. Now let's take a minute to notice some of the other lacking aspects of the hotel room. There was no guide for the tv channels, despite the idea that most guests are from out of town and don't know what the channels are. There was no hotel book with basic information, like numbers to reach the concierge, restaurant hours, gym information, etc. Nothing. Not one piece of hotel information in the room. The next morning, I was in the bathroom, and look down. Next to my feet is a parasite looking bug swarming around the room. I kill it, notice another one and kill that. On my way out the door, I tell the front office that I killed 2 gross bugs in my bathroom. He remembers me at the guest he sent pillows up to. I let him know I never got them. He looks confused, refers to a clip board, and says he will take care of the bug issue, and be sure pillows are sent up. That night - still no pillows. The next morning, two more bugs, and I notice a dark kinky hair on the floor of the bathroom. I really don't understand why people need to come in and ""clean"" my room. I mean they move my toothbrush, invariably putting germs on it for no reason. They move my things around, and leave the bugs and their hair on the floor. The last day, I found one more of those nasty bugs. I had about had it. This time, I grabbed a cup and trapped it. Then I caught a little video of it moving around in the cup, to illustrate the disgusting-ness of this hotel stay. (sorry can't post link) I showed it to the two guys at the front desk, when I was checking out. They looked dumbfounded. Didn't offer to refund any part of my stay and just let me leave without attempting to fix any part of the stay. When they asked if I would stay there again I said ""I think not.""",,Misscrf,14,1.0

When we complained we were told because we booked via Expedia, our room type was not guaranteed, and seeing as they were fully booked and had had some recent water damage to some of the rooms (bla bla bla) there was nothing that could be done. But they did provide us with 2 cots which were more comfortable (and larger) than the sofa bed. The cots had sheets, but no comforters. The queen bed also did not have a comforter (just sheets). When we requested comforters, we were told there weren't any left, but were kindly provided 5 additional sheets!!! Furthermore, the queen bed was as hard as the floor. At that point, we wanted our money back to go stay in another hotel, but we were told by front desk staff there was no manager until Monday morning, conveniently the day we were checking out, so again - no refund was possible. The next morning we spoke to Claudia at the front desk (honestly, the best thing about this hotel - they are lucky to have her). Claudia provided us with another room with 2 queens (which apparently was not available the night before, even though we were able to change rooms at 9:30am before housekeeping had started) and comforters. She also comped breakfast (mediocre) and drinks at the bar. There were other guests complaining of the same situation as we were the next morning, and they also had booked with Expedia. My husband and I stayed at this hotel August 2010 and were satisfied the first time, enough to return. Unfortunately, the last stay left a sour taste in our mouths so we won't be back a third time. If you plan on booking this hotel, do so directly with the hotel, and not Expedia, even though when we checked, Expedia was 150$ cheaper per night.","Montreal, Quebec","Curiosity802811</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Quebec</strong>",29,2.0

Hotels of superior quality in the Financial District have similar ratings, while having earned those ratings with their wide variety of appealing and functional amenities. Unfortunately, our high hopes for Eurostars Wall Street - which we based primarily on the photographs made readily available online - went largely unmet.Last week, a friend and I decided to travel from California to the Big Apple to take in a concert. Having never been to New York, I was pretty oblivious when it came to choosing the right hotel accommodations in my price range. After doing exhaustive research on my own - which yielded mixed results - I gave up and let Hotwire do the picking for me, which matched me up with EuroStars Wall Street. Despite reading some reviews that made me more than apprehensive, I tried to stay upbeat concerning its potential and promise.Upon arrival, the jovial front desk staff greeted us warmly and supplied us with our room keys, which expedited the overall check-in process. While in the lobby, it becomes immediately clear that photographs online obscure certain details of the facilities, most notably the size of the hotel itself. While this does not reflect on the integrity of the place, we were certainly taken back by it. Perhaps our own inclination to believe everything in New York is big, with its larger-than-life buildings and sky-high monuments, played a role in our ignorant befuddlement..? Your guess is as good as mine.Maybe it was their off-season, or it's possible we came and went at odd times, but the hotel itself seemed to be a virtual ghost town. During our three night stay, we only ever saw three to four guests congregated in the lobby, or waiting to check in/out. While in our room, we only ever heard one other guest coming and going on our floor. The bar and restaurant - touted by some TripAdvisor reviewers as being of exemplary quality - was positively deserted. Again, who knows why this was the case but, whatever it was, we found it strange.Once in the elevators, the presence of a biting cigarette odor quickly became apparent, and the source became even clearer once we stepped out of the elevator and into the narrow hallways. It would seem that smoking and non-smoking rooms share floors, and that residual smell from the smoking rooms bleeds out into the halls. I'm not really picky, nor would I bother to complain to the front desk about something so seemingly inconsequential, but it's worth noting in this review for the sake of travelers boasting sensitive noses, pesky allergies, or a militant disdain towards the stench of cigarette smoke.In hindsight, I've had a difficult time figuring out just what about our room fell short. Despite some sort of chemical or ever-present water stains to the bathroom counter top, my room was quite clean. However, I have to throw my weight behind some of the previous reviews that make note of the low quality carpeting. It was a peculiar choice for a hotel that postures itself as somewhat high-end, no doubt in an effort to keep in step with competition in a predominantly upscale business district.Stylistically, the rooms come together nicely. A minimalist theme takes shape, with emphasis placed on solid black-and-whites in furniture, curtains, and bathroom fixtures. A comfortable futon-style bed, as well as a very modern bathroom sink immediately catch the eye. However, upon closer inspection, wear-and-tear and shoddy workmanship from previous remodels becomes visible; including, but not limited to, inexplicable dead spots under the carpeting. Holes in the floor seem to have been carpeted over and left entirely unfilled. I would imagine this sort of thing could pose a bit of an injury concern for older guest which, in turn, should raise liability concerns for the hotel owners. Issues like the aforementioned are unfortunate, since the overarching theme of the hotel - at least in theory - is spectacular. It simply has a ways to go before it can be placed in the same stratum as its high priced pseudo-contemporaries. Located within short walking distance of the subway, as well as right down the street from Seaport for myriad shopping and dining options, Eurostars Wall Street is tucked away in arguably one of the cleanest and safest parts of New York City. If you're bringing children along, this is a wonderful neighborhood (in New York City terms) that you don't have to be wrought with worry over. McDonald's, Subway, Starbucks and Duane Reade (a CVS or Walgreens-type drug store, for my fellow ignorant west coast folk) are only a few minutes walking distance away. Cab rides from JFK to Eurostars Wall Street are a flat rate of $45 (tip not included) if you request non-toll roads.If you're looking for a no-frills, bare bones sort of hotel at a quality price, in what is traditionally considered an exorbitantly priced area, this hotel should certainly appeal to you. It has seen better days, and has its share of dinginess and stains on carpets and walls, but you will get a quiet nights sleep (save for the all-too-familiar New York City street noise). If you require the finer things in life, or expect access to things like a gym or pool, you should consider looking elsewhere. Again, this hotel is not bad by any means. It's very ambitious but, if anything, it's simply a tad underwhelming for the price tag.","Chico, California, USA","southpawgrammar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chico, California, USA</strong>",24,3.0

The carpet was not really carpet but I walked around bare foot for a while and my feet were black (my carpet at home doesnt do that). The showerhead had limescale on it and was not very powerful which has to be a first for one of the hotels that I've stayed in.

These days it should be part of the room amenities.)
