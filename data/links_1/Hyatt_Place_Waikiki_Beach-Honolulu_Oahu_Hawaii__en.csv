Any questions while you are at the hotel and they assist you immediately.Cons:-Our first room stunk horribly of mould and mildew. You could smell it the very second you opened the door. I waited it out for a few hours hoping the room was just stuffy from being closed up and I opened the balcony door but it became clear it was unhealthy mould and mildew. I couldn’t even stand to be in the room it smelt that heavily.-The rooms are quite small-Balconies are tiny, it fits only the metal chair.-Floors are quite slippery. I stepped onto the elevator on my second day there and have ended up quite banged up with swollen and bruised knees and broken phone. So be careful walking through as their surfaces are quite smooth. (I was wearing new shoes with a lot of grip on them)- 8 days after check out they are still yet to release the money back into my account that they put a hold on at check in. My bank is now getting involved as contact with Hyatt has not resolved the issue.Pros:-Decent location right near the beach and zoo.-At the top end of the main shopping strip and plenty of places to eat.- Our second room was very clean- Staff are very friendly and always up for a chat when they see you- Laundry services are available - Staff readily fix problems and help with questions (when at the hotel, not once home)- 2 small shops and a dominos within the hotel - early check in and late check out available which helped us tremendously.- bar within the hotel- Pets are allowed. It was great seeing pets walking about every day with their owners.All in all, this place had both its ups and downs.Dependant on the cost of the room and type of room I might stay here again, but there are also other places I have stayed in Hawaii of which I thoroughly enjoy. But I would not rule out Hyatt Place.","Leumeah, Australia","Nellemk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leumeah, Australia</strong>",6,3.0

Especially during the covid19, they made sure to keep us aware of the measures they were taking to ensure staff and guests’ safety and health. Beach is right down the street so you can literally watch a beautiful sunset everyday and walk back to your hotel in 2 minutes. Beds are super comfy and warm, I didn’t want to get up, but they offered breakfast also so that was enough motivation. Breakfast was delicious, and they have rice, which I would recommend, I think it’s infused with coconut. Can’t say enough good things about Hyatt Place, 10/10 would recommend staying here while in Honolulu.

I would consider this location on the very edge of “downtown Waikiki.” Only about 1 block to the right is where all the shops & restaurants start, and 1 block to the left is the zoo and then pretty much nothing else until you reach Dimond Head. But we never felt like we were out downtown, just a breath away from all the crowds on that main strip. Prefect balance. From our “city view” room, to the left we could see a sliver of the water with surfers in it between two buildings and to the right in the distance we could see a mountain. Free breakfast was great. Alternating some offerings (1 day bacon, the next sausage, 1 day zucchini spice bread, the next banana yogurt bread...), but always: cereal, amazing home style potatoes, eggs (scrambled & hard), toast, rolls. The BEST orange juice I’ve ever had, also apple, grapefruit, milks. Each day they gave us a $5 room credit to use at our will. Nice treat to use at the lobby Starbucks for snacks. Can check our free and depending on availability beach chairs, and they have plenty beach towels. Staff is very nice. ONLY Con: like in other reviews — elevators are extremely slow. Would definitely stay here again. ","Glendale, Arizona","AmandaIlla</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glendale, Arizona</strong>",0,4.0

It could not have been more comfortable. Or more convenient. Angeline, Tara and Aja at the front desk made sure to help if I needed anything.

Plus, the pool is on the 3rd floor roof, right below the ""mountain view"" rooms - which tends to get loud at night with teenagers. Breakfast was good the first couple of mornings, but you get tired of eating the same stuff every day in the rain - oh, the breakfast seating area is outside - and it rains in Waikiki - a lot. The staff was courteous, but it took over 5 hours to get the room feather free due to a severe allergy - my husband finally took all the bedding and dropped it off at the front desk before we finally were given a scratchy blanket and hard, foam pillows. I'll take partial blame for this as I didn't call ahead like I usually do. After the first night of pool-side shenanigans, the staff moved me from the 5th floor to the 14th to get away from the noise - still no view, found out the noise echos up the side of the building. On the plus side of the move, we received real feather-free pillows and a nice bed covering. I will say that the beds are extremely confortable and the rooms are a good size for extended stay - no microwave though. On a whole, the location was great - on the far side of Waikiki - but there's a lot of traffic noise all hours of the day and night.

It was not a planned trip, as my mom is widowed and on a fixed income. I frequent the bar in this hotel because I live quite close, and it’s convenient, clean, and the staff is overly accommodating. Thus my decision to have my mom stay here. I spoke to the GM, Ihab, who was able to give my mom a fantastic rate, the best room in the hotel, PLUS, VIP treatment from himself and his staff!  Check in was a breeze with Tara, who was super nice, and a lei from Heidi! Along the way to the room, mom was greeted by Aja, Angeline, Kat, Lisa, and then we moved to the bar where we were greeted by Nick! Nick made sure we had ANYTHING we needed every day that we saw him, and always made sure to acknowledge us on our way in or out! It was quite the friendly welcome from all! Each person made sure to say something to my mom on her way thru the lobby! The room was much more than what we were expecting! A nice sectional sofa, and a king size bed, a giant Lanai, and a walk in shower! Fantastic! Fruit, water and juice were also waiting for us! We also had a ninja housekeeper, I believe her name was Geraldine. She came to clean the room while we were still there, so we sat on the Lanai and let her do her thing, and next thing you know, we look up and she’s saying goodbye, and to have a great day! Like she snapped her fingers and it was clean! Sheets and all! I’d give this stay a 10/10. For a hotel that isn’t quite on the beach, only a half block away, it’s a great place to stay if you want a clean room, and a friendly staff from the GM, the AGM, Melanie, all the way down! Thank you so much, it was nice to have my mom here during this crappy time in my life! You all made it feel like a vacation for us! Aloha!",,Adkitty,0,5.0

The rooms were nice, large enough with comfortable beds. The bathrooms were well equipped and functional. We enjoyed the open air lobby where you could set and enjoy breeze while being protected from the elements. The daily breakfast buffet was ok and served its purpose with coffee, juices and basic breakfast staples. The breakfast buffet was located outside by the pool on the 3rd floor, which was also nice to eat outside in the fresh air; however the winds at times could be challange.

Check-in was quick and the gentleman who assisted us waived the resort fee for the first night, which we really appreciated. The hotel was a short walk to the beach, with an ABC store and Waikiki Trolley stop along the way. We were able to walk to many restaurants along Kalakaua and Kuhio, or when we didn't feel like walking, we took the trolley (using a four-day unlimited ride pass). Housekeeping kept our room clean (aside from a candy wrapper near the bed that was there before we arrived and remained there for the duration - no biggie though). We had a city view room, but actually had partial ocean views, which was a nice bonus! Good selection for breakfast (scrambled eggs, bacon/sausage depending on the day, toast, fruit, cereal, rice, miso soup etc.). This was great as it allowed us to start our day without having to finding a place to eat at first. You can choose to eat outside by the pool or bring your breakfast back to your room.

I have each time been either upgraded or given a late check out or hospitality room every time. Each visit I have had the pleasure of encountering some of the nicest customer service people ever! On this visit I was greeted by Eloisa at the front desk she was very professional and also very kind (yes they can go hand in hand!) She checked us in and even though I was using a free night and points, she didn't treat us any differently and even fixed our reservation so that is was a seamless stay! On my check out, I was offered an extension of a few hours without even asking! (Thanks Angeline!) All the employees that I encountered were friendly and professional. As for the rooms I am familiar with this property and know the rooms usually have a couch and sitting area aside from the bed (it is a small area but nice none the less) they have a complimentary breakfast which for people like me is a plus to grab something before I take off for the day. The pool is small and there is no hot tub but this is not what I stay there for. The location which is near the Zoo is my preference, I find it easy to get around from there. I personally love this property and would not stay in one of the more centrally located and busy properties.

We used a World of Hyatt Category 1-4 free night certificate to “pay” for the room. As such, the Hyatt served its purpose well. We had a little less than 24 hours to enjoy the Hyatt and Waikiki Beach, but a good portion of our time was spent in traffic getting from the airport to the hotel. All we really had time to do was have dinner, sleep, and walk around Waikiki Beach a little.Pluses:1. Good location close to the beach but, otherwise, surrounded by much taller hotel towers that blocked views.2. Very spacious room furnished in the usual minimalist, contemporary Hyatt Place style. Minuses:1. As is probably typical for most Honolulu hotels, the Hyatt Place is VERY busy. At times the public areas seem like an airport terminal, buzzing with frenetic energy. This is not a calm, relaxing environment.2. Complimentary breakfast wasn’t as distinctive as other Hyatt Place breakfasts I’ve experienced. There were the usual eggs, breakfast meats, etc. but a paucity of cereals, baked goods and fresh fruit. 3. The fitness room was larger than I’ve seen in other Hyatt Place properties, but several treadmills and ellipticals were not functioning. It was also very busy in the morning, and I suspect maintenance of the equipment is not keeping up with high usage. 4. The in-room HVAC system is very noisy. Fortunately, opening the patio sliding door provides ventilation. Unfortunately, street noise is considerable even into the late evening hours.I’m a big fan of Hyatt Place hotels, in general. Most have a contemporary sense of style and design; however, the building in which this Hyatt Place is located is definitely dated.

I’m going to start with the positive:The staff were very friendly and attentive, always greeting us in the hallway and even gifted us a miniature bottle of champagne as we were celebrating our anniversary. The beds were super comfortable and the breakfast was very good with lots of options. We had an ocean view king room and once you got passed the apartments in the way, the ocean was beautiful. Onto the other side of the spectrum:The hotel was going through some sort of room key upgrade and we had to return our keys on three separate occasions, one time someone was at the door of our room with some sort of device and turns out our key was “expired” and we had been locked out. They did give us a $10 credit two different times for the inconvenience but that brings me to the next downside, their elevators are terribly slow. Normally this doesn’t sound like an issue and we have no problem taking the stairs but when you are on the 14th floor and have to keep going back to the front desk for a new key it starts to get frustrating. There were three elevators and I think only two were in service which was by both staff and customers. Also, their main floor washrooms were out of service during our stay which wasn’t favourable.Overall, I thought it was way overpriced for what you get as the room we were in was quite tiny and the “balcony” left something to be desired. There is no hot tub and the pool is very small. I wouldn’t stay spend another anniversary here again but perhaps it might work out better for you.","Langley City, Canada","Rachel_m_k_5563</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Langley City, Canada</strong>",1,3.0

The balcony was also dirty and old and I had no desire to step out there. What made my stay the least pleasant was the bed. It was one of the most uncomfortable beds I’ve slept on.

This hotel is a BIG disappointment. I’ve never stayed in Hyatt Place/House, so I decided to give it a shot after reading some positive reviews. Pro (Good): LOCATION: it’s only 2-3 small blocks from the beach, so it’s very convenient. It’s near a bunch of great restaurants. Most of the ABC stores along the Beach Road are within a walking distance. There’s one basically right next to the hotel. Bus stop is very close by. COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST: it’s a buffet style breakfast with a verity of selections. My mom and I love it. They also offered Asian specialty food (I’m Asian, so I wouldn’t call this type of food “breakfast”). Food is warm, fresh and delicious. ROOM: beds and pillows are very comfortable. The room is very spacious. They provided LOTS of towels, which is very useful. They also offered beach towels, so that was a plus. Con (Bad): We checked in on November 24th 2019 with two queen beds and ocean view. Heidi Lazo (front desk) assigned us in room 932. Right after we entered the room, I caught a baby lizard (see attachment) on the desk nearby the glass/coffee area and again on the floor. After we talked to the front desk lady about the incident, she assisted us immediately (thank you); however, the same room type wasn’t available, so she assigned us another room on the 11th floor with CITY VIEW instead! Yes, we paid more money for the ocean view and never ever got to see the view of the oceans. She offered to give us a refund for the destination fees, which was basically $21/day. Our new room was 1106 - before our bedtime, my mom found a clear footprint on one bed and an old blood droplet on the other bed! Also, both beds didn’t have the same number of pillows. Inside the shower area, there were also old opened shampoo, conditioner and soap left on the tray...(the shower area was found later - very disgusting) - OK!!! FOUR PROBLEMS within hours after checking in. Again, we walked to the front desk and had to wait for a while due to them being super busy. I spoke with Heidi Lazo about the problems and showed her all the pictures. She was very nice, efficient and helpful. She sent four housekeepers up to change the bedsheets right away, so we could sleep. We didn’t want to move to another room for the 3rd time within hours of each other. Heidi offered $100 credits back to my account for all the problems we had encountered. We took it, but seriously, I wouldn’t come back to this hotel. $100 wasn’t even worth all the troubles we had. We spent more money on the ocean view room but got the city view room instead because the room wasn’t having a lizard and not being cleaned properly. However, when the housekeeping cleaned our room the next day, she didn’t bother cleaning the shower tray (old stuffs were still there, that means they didn’t even clean the bathroom!! We had a trouble taking a shower for all 3 days since we got no tray to put the shower stuff on. We DID NOT want to touch those stuff ourselves, so we had to put all of our shower stuffs outside the shower instead and had to keep opening and closing the shower door to get it! There was also some confusion. The housekeeper cleaned our room one day and skipped the next day. We didn’t even have the “do not disturb” on. I called the front desk, and she said “your room is under the green program, that’s why housekeeper didn’t come in and clean it.” What kind of green program is this when a housekeeper comes in one day and skips the next? Even that, don’t they have to provide the toiletries daily? When we asked them to deliver it to our room, it took him (housekeeper) approximately 30 minutes while I was in a shower waiting for the supplies. He was giving us a little bit of an attitude with the unhappy look on his face - no good!! It was our vacation, but we had to deal with these nonsense problems for the lack of cleanliness and ignorant of the housekeepers. Throughout our stays here, we always observed a few housekeepers standing outside guest elevators on the 2nd floor chitchatting. It would have been better if you could use all these time to pay more attention to the guest rooms. HOUSEKEEPING DEPARTMENT is definitely needing big improvement. I wasn’t impressed!! IRONING: The iron was leaking very badly. I couldn’t wear the dress I wanted because it was soaking wet!!AIR CONDITIONING: it was very quiet, but it was way too cold, and we couldn’t even adjust it. Thanks Heidi Lazo for all your helps, but after all these, we wouldn’t come back. ","Seattle, Washington","Palmmy_K1266</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",6,1.0

When we arrived at the hotel, I wasn't expecting a room to be ready, but she got one ready so speedily so that my mom could be comfortable and have a chance to settle in. Although the other Front Desk employees were great, Annabelle definitely stood out and should be commended for her timeliness, empathy, and superb service.THE LOCATION: While the location of Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach is definitely close to the touristy parts of Waikiki, my mom enjoyed it for its proximity to restaurants and shops. I did love how close it was to the beach (about 5-10 minutes) and it definitely was perfectly located for my daily runs to Diamond Head! I do like how it's located further off the ""Waikiki strip"" and thus is quieter than other hotels closer to the water. Additionally, there are plenty of convenience stores (ABC Stores) right by the hotel!THE ROOM: Our room was adequate for our stay! It was extremely clean and immaculate upon check-in. We had a city view, so it was nothing too special, but we did get a very partial view of the beach from our balcony! The bed was super comfortable and having a fridge in the room was a godsend. THE SERVICE: As I mentioned at the beginning of my review, the service from most of the staff was simply marvelous. Annabelle was absolutely phenomenal. Additionally, the Housekeeping staff at the Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach are friendly and speedy. I would also like to thank the staff during breakfast service who had to deal with so many hotel guests, but managed to make it a stress-free and clean experience!THE AMENITIES: FREE BREAKFAST! My mom and I really enjoyed this part of staying at the Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach as it was helpful for meal planning for the rest of the day. The options provided were also plentiful and varied, not to mention delicious! The Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach also offers guests a pool, fitness center, amongst other amenities that make it a really special place.Overall, our stay at Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach was fantastic.

After much research and comparisons my wife and I booked this hotel as part of a package through Expedia, price and location wise it was tough to beat. While not a brand new or super luxury hotel we found this hotel worked very well for us. Our room was very much as pictured on the hotels website, contemporary and fairly new furnishings, basic but functional bathroom, good quality bed and bedding, lots of towels, and a great (quiet) air conditioner.Check in on a Saturday afternoon was very quick and the desk staff were very helpful and friendly. The elevator to our 10th floor room was very fast and our room proved to be very quiet and clean. The pool is small, no real onsite restaurants (Dominos Pizza) but they do have a pretty decent complimentary buffet style breakfast every morning outside on the 3rd floor patio/pool area. There is also a coffee bar by the front desk that serves Starbuck's coffee, juice, beer, wine, fresh fruit and pastry treats.Every staff member we encountered at this hotel was really friendly and accommodating. The TV and wi-fi worked great, the shower was strong, and the washroom has a seperate sink area which works well for two people getting ready in the morning.The location is close to Diamond Head but only a few minutes walk to shopping, and the number of restaurants within a 5 minute walk from this hotel are too numerous to count. The beach is less than a 5 minute walk down the street and was visible from our room. Complimentary towels are available for the beach at the front desk.Overall the price, location, complimentary breakfast and friendly service make this a great choice. We would stay again.","New Westminster, Canada","doogietraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Westminster, Canada</strong>",21,4.0

Hyatt did a really job in facelifting a very aged property, but there still lots of work that needs to be done to bring it up to the expected Hyatt standard. Over a two nights stay, got severely bitten by bed bugs and had to switch into 3 different rooms during a two nights stay. All of the rooms that were visited, the floor carpets definitely felt not cleaned for weeks to months (yes, it was that dirty). You could not walk around the carpet barefoot since it was very dirty, itchy and at times, muddy. It was very obvious that the carpets have not been shampooed for a very long time. All of the 3 sofa beds that were tried in three separate rooms, all 3 were very dirty and could definitely tell that housekeeping did not change the sheets in the sofa bed for a very long time. One had a complete infestation of bed bugs and after the second night, got tired of complaining to the staff about their standards of basic hygiene. The air conditioning filters needed to be changed since the air quality, although cool, had a smell that the air filters were overdue to be changed. Worked with Brian, assisted general manager, who really tried to make things right over our two night stay. If it wasn't for the awesome interactions with the rest of the staff as well as the food quality at breakfast, I would have ranked this place much lower. Hyatt is doing a really good job in trying to improve this property since the previous property could have easily been completely demolished and rebuilt (the condition when Hyatt took over was very poor). Hyatt brought this property from the dumps, but there is no way, close to the condition of other Hyatt properties that I've stayed at.

Breakfast was more or less the same every morning, but the food was pretty good (miso soup and rice are a ++), so no complaints there!Pros:-Very friendly staff who are very helpful (everyone from valet, parking attendants, concierge, food and beverage, housekeeping)- You get a $5 credit to be spent at the snack bar every day- Free beach towels, chairs, boogie board rentals (2 per room)- Close to cheap parking ($25/night at Sunset Waikiki or the Aston Banyan)- Right next to ABC store!- Really close to the beach, less than a 5 minute walk!Cons:- Beware of the birds during breakfast on the 3rd floor. They steal your food, one even pooped on my sister's head! - I booked a ""1 King Bed, Ocean View with Single Sofa Bed"" room, the single sofa is no joke. You can't turn or roll anywhere on that bed.

We booked a sunset cruise on our first night( the bus scheduled to pick up for the tour was 30 mins delayed and waiting at the wrong hotel for us ..not Abbie’s fault but the fault of the bus company. Abbie called them on our behalf and waited outside with us and called again when delayed further.She remained positive about getting us on that evening and we did!we had the most enjoyable sunset cruise (excellent recommendation) We also booked a snorkeling trip for my family and ourselves. Got travel info on hikes, bikes etc and Abbie was a tremendous help organizing it all. She was always enthusiastic, ready to help and full of info and suggestions. Abbie, you’re amazing.

Such a great hotel did the Zoo end of Waikiki and so it’s quieter than the other end .2 blocks back from the beach with an ABC just one block away. Check in staff friendly upon arrival and throughout stay .Dominos pizza also located on the property. .The room was lovely with Amazing water views , to be able to sit on balcony to watch sunset is something special. The true king bed was comfortable , and linen and towels of good quality , bathroom towels all new large and fluffy towels unlike some other hotels. The room also has a mini fridge and an in room safe which is not mentioned anywhere. The room was spotlessly clean with housekeepers being friendly offering Aloha each time you saw them. The hotel Currently has FREE breakfast on offer on level 3 0630-0930 which is a good amount of time. There is ,scrambled eggs, sausages bacon, potatoes, pancakes, waffles, plus selection of cereals and yoghurts , toasts, fruit juice , fresh fruit and teas, coffees. Previous comments have complained about ques at breakfast and seating issues .Well I personally I had no issues with either, the hotel were constantly replacing dishes and so always plenty on offer and the place was cleaned non stop.Some guests need to remember its a buffet style breakfast and you can go back for seconds if need be. Seating also not a problem and plenty of pools side seating. The hotel also serves breakfast in the foyer as the same time to assist with crowding , people have mentioned this has less selection that the main area, this is incorrect and it’s the same selection, so choose what ever is most convenient to you.I did see a sign that from 01Nov that breakfast is only only avail to Hyatt members on selected rates which is good and may stop some people doing their daily shop at the Buffett. People have previously Complained about the wait times and lift amount of people waiting for lifts, I did not encounter this issue. .My only lift feedback was there is never a lift on the ground floor at any time of the day or night .The hotel also has a great gym, and 3 washer and 3 dryer machines located on level 3 behind the gym. The laundry is $3 and takes coins and or credit card which is handy.Beach / pool towels are avail from the pool and reception , they also loan beach chairs and pool/beach toys .As part of the resort fee charged you have a $5 room credit per day to use , and at reception there is a snack bar with food, drinks , Starbucks etc.I used my voucher for a good coffee each day and not wasted. Denny’s also located 2 blocks down road towards zoo .My only gripe with the hotel was the water saving shower head which had decreased water flow and made showering difficult , and the other issue is the resort feee, and yes all property’s in Waikiki charge it , but why just not add it to the room rate and have it as a total include all tax, fee, resort fees, as it is annoying upon check out to be hit with daily fee as total. You can also earn Hyatt points or airline frequent flyer miles on rates , which I did as I booked direct on website. Hotel also sends emails day before and can pay for early check in and or late check out for a minimal fee to save sitting around all day waiting for check in , it was a well worth it price .Would I stay here again? Absolutely Would in recommend this hotel ? Absolutely. All in all I would rate the hotel a 9/10.Having being a previous Hilton return guest , Hyatt place has one me and hope to return soon.

The hotel room that we got has air conditioning that isn't working! Oahu in August is VERY hot and it is nice to have a hotel room to cool down - we asked for maintenance to get it fixed THREE times but it was never fixed! When we checked in, our room was at 20 degrees Celsius but it felt so hot - we had family checked in on the same floor as us and they have their AC unit set 23 degrees Celsius and it was already cold enough. So our first night was rough due to sweating throughout the night. When maintenance came the first time to fix our AC unit, he lowered it down to 16 degrees Celsius, but we were still sweating throughout our second night. When we asked to get it fixed the next day, we were told to wait for engineers to fix the AC unit, so we stayed at our hotel room the whole day, BUT NO ONE came to our room. When I asked for the third time, the maintenance came to clean the AC unit as he said it's dirty that's was it's not working properly so he asked us again to request for maintenance the next day to clean the outside AC unit - at that point after the third time of requesting to get our AC fixed, I got tired of following up.. so I was like whatever there is no point following up with these people every single day. So our whole six nights of staying there was not the best experience.. I shared this disappointing experience when we checked out and the lady said it's weird that no one offered us a different room - well yes I could've asked for a different room but it's supposed to be their job to be the first one to offer us a different room AFTER THREE TIMES of requesting to get our AC unit fixed.",,roxanne9876,3,1.0

We had been here once before without kids and stayed in a small rented condo. Since we only planned to be here three nights, the relatively small rooms and few blocks from the beach were fine. We highly valued having three beds so our two older kids would each have a bed. We did have a car and made it out to Pearl Harbor, Dole, and the North shore. Getting to the hotel from anywhere wasn’t terrible with easy access to and from the freeway. Valet parking was a slow and expensive. At arrival a tour bus was parked in front obstructing the entrance and another car was blocking the drive securing gear. It took about 10 minutes to get parked and unloaded. The next day, we waited five minutes before someone showed up to park my car. Honestly, I wasn’t even sure it was someone working at the hotel. We had planned to park and leave once a day to make it easier so not a huge issue. The room itself is big for a hotel but smaller than a studio condo rental. For a longer stay, it would make sense to find a larger condo with a kitchen. Although on the 10th floor, the road noise was relatively loud. I would have expected a quieter room.The staff was friendly and helpful including some good suggestions for dinner. Borrowing beach gear is a plus with any other essentials easily purchased at the near by ABC. The breakfast was functional but know that the lobby breakfast has a few less options than the pool option but with way less people and no wind to battle. Honestly, Oahu is our least favorite island however, everyone should go at least once and experience Waikiki and Pearl Harbor. We wanted to take our kids but from now on will go to Kauai or the Big island. Be aware that drivers in Oahu are as terrible as the traffic. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to a family coming to Oahu for the first time who didn’t rent a car planning to spend no more than three days before heading to a better Hawaiian island.

We stayed in the ocean view room and was surprised how poorly designed the room was with regards to wasted space. Like the bathroom shower door would literally be 1 inch from hitting the toilet, yet there was wasted space by the desk area. I'm sorry but I would rather not feel like the toilet is that close to the shower door verses having extra feet of space by the desk. Also, getting the ocean view was a waste of money because there are high tower hotels obstructing the view of the ocean. Customer service was great. The resort fee covers $5/day, and we used it for the chocolate chip cookies. They were the best!The free breakfast for Hyatt members was very underwhelming. They basically had yugart, oat meal, breads, eggs (super runny), bacon or ham depending on the day, waffles, fresh fruit, etc. The bacon was super cheap, thin and full of fat. The eggs were always not fully cooked so it was always way too runny, and in thought they would provide something else like donuts, bagels or small pastries. For all of these reasons, I was not impressed.Finally, I'd like to mention how annoying it was to use the elevators! There were 2 elevators on one side and 3 on the other side. However, it would literally take 5 mine to get the elevator to open. Plus by that time more people are waiting for the elevator so if you are in line that would mean it would take like 10 minutes to just get to your floor. We often used the stairs from the 11th floor to the 3rd floor for breakfast, since we don't want to wait forever to get food.I'd recommend this hotel for the overall value, but personally I do not plan on returning for said reasons.","San Francisco, California","rochellerankins</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",1,4.0

The location is pretty awesome. You’re steps away from Waikiki beach, a ton of restaurants and shopping. They also offer free beach towels, so be sure to ask for one before you head over to the beach. Room: we got upgrade to a mountain view room, but the view was less than impressive. We saw a sliver of mountain between two high-rises in the distance. Both of us slept comfortably, which was good enough for us. Breakfast: we tried their free breakfast and it wasn’t very good. It was chaotic with all the kids running around and screaming early in the morning. The scrambled eggs were soggy and runny.. overall, a poor experience. Parking: they charge $39 for valet, which was the only parking option we had even though we read that there was self parking available (not true). This fee will give you in and out privileges; you’ll just need to ring them up 10 minutes in advance so they can fetch your car. There is also a parking lot diagonal to the hotel, which charges $30 for 24 hour parking. The cheapest option is parking at the zoo parking lot nearby, which is $1.50 per hour and you can park there overnight with no problems. Since we were renting a car and driving out every day early in the morning, we only had to park at the zoo at most 12 hours, so that costed us only $18, yay! If you don’t mind walking for 4-5 minutes to the hotel, this is the most economical IMO. Just keep in mind that there are a ton of tourists in this area and Waikiki Beach, so going there to park at peak times can result in an overcrowded lot and you may not find a spot. Destination fees (via Expedia): this was very annoying. I had another look at my Expedia receipt and low and behold there was a destination fee charge there (which I may have known when I booked it but was outraged when I was reminded upon arrival). How can you avoid this charge? You can’t, if you’re booking through a third party like Expedia unfortunately. We booked one night directly, because I had enough points to get us a free night and with that booking there was no destination fee. Perhaps, they are doing this to recoup some of the cost that OTAs are charging hotels, but it also seems unfair that the customer (us travelers) are suffering as a result. If you get charged, make the most out of it and make sure you use your $10 allowance each day to buy a bottle of water or two otherwise it’s going to waste.

The hotel itself is situated just 2 quick blocks away from the pacific ocean!!! Its really a quick short walk to the world famous Waikiki beach, but more notable beaches are to be visited if your in Oahu in the North Shore. Front desk and the hotel lobby is an open air setting with no physical wall separating the environments but it works, I never once was turned off by that fact. The front desk hosts were always accommodating, helpful, and go above and beyond in being accessible through text too! Upon check-in your given a phone number to text and it goes to the front desk where you get real live responses. The rooms were amazing. My room had a balcony with a tiny table and two chairs. The bed was really comfy and featured plush blankets. The only grief I would have with the room is the pillows, they are not firm at all, I needed two stacked on each other just to get a decent level of firmness. Bathroom, closet, and entertainment console were perfect, bathroom sink had plenty of room for my stuff, closet was spacious enough and there's a safe in there too that can be programed each time you open it up. The tv has this adapter that lets you connect your laptop to it, so it was nice to take advantage of streaming in the little time I was in the room. The tv also has an app so you don't have to use that dreaded hotel tv remote after you set that up. Breakfast seems to be included with all rates and its served in two spots, on the lobby floor by the business center and the 3rd floor where the pool is at. The pool location has the bulk of seats and I never really had trouble finding me a seat, just word of advice, don't look away from your food for even a second, seagulls and birds will eat your breakfast up quicker than you can react. The food was pretty much straightforward, eggs, potatoes, various meat (depending on day, I had sausage, beacon, and something else) various breakfast breads, cereals, milk, juice, fresh cut fruit, and what appeared to be a Japanese version of breakfast. The meat changes daily, ie beacon was only featured once in my stay, but I think it think it had to do with the fact I was there for four breakfasts. The food can be consumed at either the lobby, 3rd floor, or in the room, a tray is provided to take your breakfast to go to your room if you desire.

The hotel is definitely dated and I could tell that in my rooms and the hotels in general (not run down or anything, but dated). The King room was small (by American hotel room standards), but still comfortable. Hotel room came with free breakfast (though signs in elevator said this was going away for non-members in November 2019). Free breakfast was good, small selection of hot foods (eggs, bacon, pancakes, rice, miso soup) and fruit and bread. Coffee was ironically Seattle's Best. Hotel is really close to the beach, about 2 blocks or a 5-7 minute walk. The part of Waikiki closest to the hotel is really safe for kids. There's an area that's blocked in by some walls so the water is never too rough. In the mornings (7amish), the water is super shallow and you can walk to the wall and the water only goes up 3-4 feet. Definitely recommended for kids or other people who can't swim. It does get really crowded in the afternoon though. But mornings were peaceful. Hotel also charged $15 a day for ""destination fee"" which came with beach towels and beach chair rentals (super convenient). It also included a $5 credit to use at the bar (practically one bottle of drink + 1 piece of fruit). The free wifi was good and very strong (we streamed Youtube with no problem). Valet was $39 (there's a $20 garage across the street). Valets were really nice and tried to be quick, but depending on how many people were waiting for their cars, it could take anywhere from 2-20 minutes to park or pick up your car.

The hotel was beautiful and well kept. We spent our daily $5 gift allowance at the beverage bar. It was something we enjoyed each evening before bed. The expansive free breakfast bar was our morning family gathering place. Huge variety, in fact the best of anywhere we’ve traveled (except for the cruises we’ve been on). Our king room (#705) was spacious and we loved the toilet was separate from the sink area. Big walk-in shower. Ours was a city view room but we actually had a slice of an ocean view which gave us a sunrise and a sunset view each day. The hotel was at the end of the main “strip” of Waikiki beach but was just a short 2 block walk to the nearest beach with swimming access. One block away is an ABC store, The Tiki Bar and Grill (Aston Hotel), and a trolley/bus/etc drop-off and pick-up location is 2 blocks away and just across the street from the beach. There was a small workout center with treadmills, ellipticals, and free-weights. There was a small laundry facility which we used twice. The cost was $3 per load plus laundry supplies. Machines accept cash or card. Laundry supplies are cash only. No dryer sheets available. Next time I’ll take 5-6 dryer sheets from home in a sandwich baggie. You’ll have to be strategic In timing because they are in constant use. One night we were using the laundry machines at midnight. There are 2 gift shops, one more of a clothing type of shop. At one of the stores we rented boogie boards, beach umbrellas, and beach chairs. $5 a day for boogie boards. The hotel also offers free beach chairs and beach towels at the front desk. We used them every day. The only negative I can say is the very small pool size and the slow elevators - both of which are minor in comparison to all the positives. I highly recommend this hotel for amenities, location, and excellent service. ","Eugene, Oregon","4puddles</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Eugene, Oregon</strong>",1,4.0

A survey popped up while using the complimentary WiFi provided to Hyatt members. On the survey, I reported the experience as 9/10, only because the parking (valet only) was expensive ($40/day) and there was no microwave (my kids like mac n cheese and warm milk at night). I only complained about parking because I was on extended stay there (18 days). Literally almost immediately after I submitted the review, they called my room, offering me a discounted parking rate ($25/night) and a microwave from the waitstaff (previous inquiries to get a microwave resulted in ""come downstairs and we'll heat things up for you"", which was conveniently inconvenient to go 18 floors each way every night because my kids wanted mac n cheese or milk). I'm grateful they responded. I had already purchased a microwave for the room, so the concession was unnecessary, but really appreciated the discounted parking for the remainder of my stay.

We were told we could stay in that room for one night then we had to move to a different room for the duration of our stay which was ridiculous. We asked for a baby crib to be sent up to the first nights room while we were waiting to get the keys and it wasn't there when we got up, had to wait 40+ minutes. The valet parking cost went up after I booked my stay but before I checked in and they tried to charge me more, but the manager overrode that.

I was under the impression that stays booked with award points still qualified for the resort amenities (such as towel service, gift bag upon check-in, free water, etc) but was told otherwise by the check-in staff. The room did not have enough body wash for 2 guests and there was no microwave (I had to eat my food cold). The street noise was very unbearable as one Wednesday morning we woke up to a helicopter that was flying around from 6am-9am. I was unhappy about the valet parking which was very high compared to other hotels in the area. However there were definitely some positives. For the price it can't be beat. The hotel is a 2-minute walk from Waikiki Beach which was just perfect if you want to save on beachfront views. Housekeeping was quick to make our room, replace with body wash, and replenish with clean towels. Eloisa was very accommodating with all our requests with water refill and purchasing drinks at the Gallery.

The hotel provides nice beach towels so you dont have to pack them and also rents beach chairs. They provide a decent breakfast in the morning but it is crowded. You will find a second buffet set up in the lobby. While it does not have everything the main breakfast area has it is much less crowded.The wifi works well in the hotel. Our room was on the small side for a Hyatt Place. Expect a line when you check in but it moves briskly. Parking is valet only for $40 a day and it can take a while to get your car brought to you in the morning.

Our family was visiting for a short period of time specifically to celebrate Mother’s Day and I couldn’t asked for more in return. Being our first time here at the Hyatt Place Waikiki, I am quite impressed by the staff and the overall generous Aloha they have given us. I had book a package deal through Hawaiian Airlines and since it was my first time doing that, I wasn’t aware of what type of room we would get. The one I had booked originally was for a Standard room with a King Bed and a city view. The first vibe that I got upon entering Room #216 was not what I had expected. It was a little smaller for my taste and the view was not appealing. I was a little heart broken knowing this is what I paid for, 4 nights and 3 days. I was very hesitant at first to ask the front desk for a possible room change because I didn’t want to be a hassle. I just went with my gut and called the operator. I spoke with a sweet lady named Heidi and she was very accommodating to my situation and said that a room will not be available until the next day due to availability with graduation and the holiday going on. That gave me a little hope knowing everything will be taken care of. We went on accepting the room change for the next day and decided to get some late lunch. What’s super convenient is they had a Dominos Pizza eatery right in the hotel. That was a plus! I wasn’t quite satisfied at the fact that the room change wouldn’t be until the next day so I caught a front desk person who happened to be the Manager On Duty named Heidi. She was very comforting and really took the initiative to take great care of us. She moved us quickly into Room #609 with 2 queen beds, a pull out sofa, and a much spacious room. The view wasn’t as bad as the first room but I was instantly relieved and felt right at home with this room. The ambience and smell was perfectly acceptable. Thanks Joan!! The valet guys were very courteous and always greeted us on the spot coming in or out. I will rave about how much I enjoyed the free breakfast from 6a-10am!! It was super delicious and I couldn’t be more happier to the extent of what great guest service I had receive throughout my entire trip.

You can leave your bags in the lobby after you check out and retrieve them when you are ready to go to the airport. I was there for a work conference and also vacation. Our room was one king bed and small-medium in size, but more than suitable for two people. The balcony was nice. I was extremely pleased with the cleanliness of the room and the daily cleaning staff, the room was spotless. The room was quiet at night, there was the occasional siren outside but this is expected in the city. The location of the hotel is so close to the beach, only about one block away. The hotel is at the eastern side of Waikiki, which in my opinion is the nicer end. The whole Waikiki strip is within walking distance. There is an ABC store right next to the hotel for convenience purchases. The hotel buffet breakfast is quite good, there is a lot of selection and fresh fruit. If you choose to eat outside you will occasionally have to deal with some birds but that is just part of eating outside.

The staff was very kind, always saying ""Good morning Sir"" or ""Aloha"". When we booked we didn't realize there would be a buffet breakfast included. Excellent way to start our days & it really had everything we would want. Some items rotate from day to day like maybe sausages one day, and back bacon the next. Trust me, it's all there. Very enjoyable. You might have to shoo away some birds on the deck, but it didn't really bother us much. The location is a few blocks from the beach, and with our rental car we ended up parking at the Honolulu Zoo. It's only $1 per hour and we had no issues parking overnight. You can get a text sent to your phone just before times up if you need to extend. The gym was modern and clean. The laundry machines were large and reasonably priced.

In many ways, the Hyatt Place feels like another tree in this forest. It is an older property that has been expanded and adapted to the Hyatt Place brand. But it's definitely a better-than-average Waikiki hotel. The renovations make the rooms a little nicer, the staff is a little nicer and more professional, and you get a decent free breakfast buffet (much like at a Hyatt Place on the mainland, but with a few twists, mostly additions for the Asian market). The property is a short 2 blocks to the beach, and they will let you borrow some (bad) beach chairs and towels. The only real negatives are a small pool and slowish elevators. If you have a car and don't feel like paying the hefty parking fee, you can usually find free parking less than 10 minutes away on Monsarat Ave. As with all Waikiki hotels, I think there are better places in Hawaii to vacation (this is an urban beach), but a short stay here can be very pleasant.","Philadelphia, PA","Dave R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, PA</strong>",1182,4.0

Sausage, bacon or ham, eggs, potatoes, oatmeal, fruit, miso soup, rice, done breads-location: very close to the beach (ask front desk for towels and chair)-reasonable resort fee ($15/day) compared to $30 at most other hotels-$5 credit per room per day, which we used to buy water ($3 a bottle or fruits $1 each). We used it to buy Frappuccino at their cafe ($5ish)-close to lots of shops and restaurants in the Waikiki area.-rooms were clean, staff were helpful-They only give you water on the first day if you are not a tiered hyatt member. It’s ok just buy it for $1 at the abc store next door.-the ocean view is blocked by other buildings.In conclusion I would come back!I’ve stayed at the Aston next to it before, prefer Hyatt place.

The Hyatt Place let me and my wife down this time. We came back from a long day out to a dirty, uncleansed room. The front desk told us that they clean rooms up until 10 pm, which I never heard of before. They also charge a resort fee when they are far from any resort that I know of. Their $5 credit per diem is a sham because a small juice cost more than $5, so we actually lose money on the credit.

The first thing we noticed is how friendly everyone is from the first person we met to the last when we departed. When we checked in, Aja was very welcoming, informative, helpful, and the embodiment of the spirit of ALOHA. We did not feel rushed and she answered all our questions and offered helpful suggestions. The valet personnel were very efficient, positive and organized. Our room was spacious, very clean and well appointed with nice towels and linens. My husband had a spacious area to set upon his computer and do his business work in and there was even a couch with a sofa bed in it. The wifi worked great. We appreciated the refrigerator where we could store our cold drinks and an ice machine by the elevators on our floor. There are also laundry machines in the building which is nice if you stay more than a couple days. The complimentary breakfast that comes with your stay is more than substantial with hot and cold foods which included scrambled eggs, juices, coffees, teas, waffles, pastries, cereals, fresh fruits, and even miso soup.There is a swimming pool, too. Though this property is not on the beachfront, it is within easy walking distance of the beach and so many restaurants and shopping areas with something for everyone. We found this hotel a cozy place to come ""home"" to after a fun day in Waikiki and Honolulu. You can get back to your room in minutes as the elevators are right there as you enter the property and have the security of needing your room key to access the guest floors. There is a small bar in the lobby where you can get a limited variety of drinks and snacks, though you are surrounded by more than enough places to have food and drink.

This makes this location an excellent choice for budget travelers as the price is reflective of it. It's only a block away from the Honolulu zoo and a few blocks away from the large mall area in the center of Waikiki. That's not what makes this location shine though.All the staff at this location is nothing but smiles, and not the sort that one comes to expect as the facade of the service industry. The people at this location are genuinely happy to be here, from the Aloha's to the Mahalo's, there is a sense of care behind them. At my arrival I was greeted by Heidi at the front desk who was as happy as they come. She took one look at my tired face(11 hours and a good amount of turbulence on the flight here) and quickly went to work finding my room, thanking me for my loyalty she promptly upgraded me to a high oceanfront room. In addition, she asked me about any celebrations I might be doing and when I told her it was our anniversary she offered us a small celebratory gift. She also provided us with water for our stay.The lobby was and open design with a contemporary feel, with a couple of nice decor elements. A lot of seating was available, and while I did not use the valet, they did appear to be quiet active.So off to our room in under ten minutes, we went. We had booked a standard city view room king, and as mentioned we were upgraded to a high oceanfront room. The room had a large king bed in the middle with a small sectioned off desk(where I'm typing up this review now), and a balcony with a nice view of the ocean. Now, unfortunately, through no fault of the hotel and the staff, that view was mostly obstructed by several large buildings. Still, I had no complaints due to the price paid and the unexpected upgrade. The bathroom is split into the sink area and the toilet/shower stall.The room came with a complimentary breakfast in the morning. The breakfast options were good, offering eggs/meat/waffle/potatoes on the hot side. Cereal/Oatmeal/Fruits/Yoghurt on the cold side. Coffee/Juices/Bread was standard fare. What stands apart is the freshness of the food served. The eggs were fluffy, instead of the usual steamed cakey consistency you get at other chains. The potato was local and the ham was not dry. Four words, fresh squeezed grapefruit juice!!! >.< But in a good way.The only cons that I will mention is that despite the beautiful lobby, parts of the hotel could use some updating. The carpet in our room was showing it's age, the balcony was a bit rough around the edges. The pool could use some touching up, it is quite stained in various parts but considering the hotel is a block away from the ocean. The noise dampening is a little light in the rooms as well. But an attentive staff and it's location to price ratio more than make up for any of these issues. I will definitely consider this location the next time I return to this area.Again, big shout out to Heidi at the front desk and the staff at this location.

The hotel is conveniently located two blocks from a trolley stop, and right across the street from a bus stop where many tour buses pick up (including the bus to Kualoa Ranch and the Polynesian Cultural Center). The hotel is a bit dated, but the rooms are clean, and very big. We had a room on the 11th floor that featured two queen sized beds and a pull out couch. The room had a dresser/desk combo with three large drawers. There was also a full sized safe. Our room had a small balcony that featured a partial ocean view (though most of the view was of dingy buildings in the area). The beds were comfortable. The bathroom was a bit old but clean. The showerhead was very powerful, making it nearly impossible to shower without soaking the floor. The hotel had plentiful beach towels available at the front desk, and you also offered beach chairs for loan. There was an ABC store a block away (and several more ABC stores within a five minute walk) if you want to pick up some drinks or snacks for the room. The hotel includes breakfast. The breakfast was very good with some variety each day. Everyday they had scrambled eggs, delicious breakfast potatoes, and one kind of meat (Portuguese sausage, shoulder bacon, and bacon were the choices when we were there). They also had a fourth dish each day (waffles, pancakes, or corned beef hash when we were there). There were also several breads and pastries to choose from, plenty of fresh fruit, and even miso soup and white rice. Our only complaint about the buffet was that seating was a bit tight, but this may have been due to the fact that there were several school marching bands staying in the hotel at the them same time as us. The pool at the hotel was small and dingy. It was very uninviting, so we didn't go in the pool at all during our stay.

While I definitely recommend hitting up some of the local joints (Yogur Story and Koko Head cafe) for breakfast at least once during your stay, this breakfast can really help stretch your budget, especially if you're traveling with a family!Parking is normally $12 but it fills up pretty quickly. The valet is $35/night and honestly, it's probably just worth it to do that since you won't have to worry about finding a spot and filling meters for your entire trip.Beds are comfortable, rooms are spacious, amenities are fine and the mountain view lanai has a really nice view of Diamond Head.The Hyatt Centric is more modern and a bit fancier, but lacks the amenities that the Hyatt Place (including breakfast), and the Hyatt Regency, while being way fancier, is not necessarily worth the price difference IMO. For all of your point grinders, the point difference is 16K per night which is a pretty significant and means you can book 4 days at the Hyatt Place compared to 2 days at the Centric or Regency.I highly recommend the Hyatt Place on your next visit to Oahu. Whether you're solo, with friends, or with your family, the location, the price, and the breakfast will allow you to enjoy more of the island without spending more to do so.","Los Angeles, California","Road50832846579</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",1,5.0

So I suffered from migraines almost my entire trip. I thought it was just our room, however, I asked multiple guests who stayed on the same floor and they had the same experience. You could also smell it throughout the hallways. Also, I've stayed in several Hyatt place hotels and this hotel had the worst food of them all. The best thing about breakfast was the fresh fruit.

We LOVED our stay at HP Waikiki Beach and would recommend this hotel to anyone and wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again ourselves. We arrived very late at night after a couple of long flights and valet and front desk staff greeted us very warmly and quickly got us into our room for a much needed rest. We were also welcomed as World of Hyatt members and were glad to receive our tote bag and a couple bottles of water since I had forgotten to pack a tote bag for trips to the beach! The room we had was lovely, clean, and had a great partial view of Diamond Head. We very much enjoyed having a fridge for our drinks and lovely balcony that we got a lot of use out of every day. We were drawn to this hotel for a couple of reasons, and one of the main reasons was the included breakfast for WoH members - well they did not disappoint! This breakfast each morning was incredibly impressive for an included hotel breakfast and the staff was so warm and welcoming each morning. We were blown away with the offerings each morning and the fact that some things were different each day, while some were the same. We had monkey bread on our very first morning and were hoping all week to see it again before we left...luckily our very last morning we were able to enjoy it again. ;) Lots of great choices on any given day including: eggs, potatoes, shoulder bacon (yum), sausages, pancakes, waffles, yogurt, cereal (hot and cold), fresh fruit, banana yogurt bread, coffee/tea, and juice. Awesome! We looked forward to visiting the breakfast area to start our day each morning. Location was great. Off the beach, but only a few minutes walk and was no problem day or evening. Felt safe every time. Close to ABC store for incidentals or beverages, etc (although as you will quickly discover, just about everyone in Waikiki is “close to an ABC store”) ;)There were a few “cons” to our visit as well, but nothing so serious that could not be fixed (hopefully) for the future and would keep us from recommending or staying again...1) The WiFi in the room was very poor and sometimes non-existent. It seemed to work fairly good down in the lobby/bar area but that is inconvenient for us and I would rather be able to check email/twitter, research our excursions for the following day, or communicate with our family from the comfort of our room. 2) The elevators to the Diamond Head rooms were pretty poor and most of the time during our week-long stay that tower was serviced by 1/3 elevators. Sometimes the 3rd elevator would be working (but rare) and the middle elevator never operated once (that we saw) during our entire stay. This made traveling to and from your room extremely slow and painful and made for some very crowded elevator rides at certain times/days. It also seemed that there was not an exclusive staff elevator which also seemed to cause congestion and delays - not only for guests - but also for staff trying to do their job. 3) The pillows were terrible. Period. Far too flat and ruined what was otherwise a fairly comfortable bed. 4) Front desk staff should be made better aware of the partnership with MGM MLife program as the person checking us in was unaware of why I was presenting my MLife card and knew nothing of this option to earn MGM tier points and I had to revisit the front desk the following day and although I was assured at that time my number would be added to the reservation, I was not 100% confident with this fellow either. Since getting home I have inquired repeatedly on the status of this points credit and although World of Hyatt has finally confirmed the transfer has been made, I am still struggling to get confirmation of the same from MLife. I feel if this was all entered from the start (as it should have been) I wouldn’t have had to follow up and make sure the points went to the correct loyalty program. In closing the pros most definitely still outweigh the cons and we would highly recommend giving this place a shot to impress you. We did receive a lovely email message back from the front office manager Eian Kim after filling out the hotel’s emailed survey with the same suggestions after our stay. It is nice to know they are read and appreciated as I think this great hotel could be even better if some of these things were addressed.

The rooms are spacious, enough for 2 queens and a double-pull out bed. Enough room to still not feel crowded when the outdoor furniture was brought in to prepare for stormy weather. The shower/toilet area is quite tight, but the sink is outside the door, which lets other members of your party get ready at the same time. There’s a balcony with a couple of chairs & table. Cleaning service is efficient and good - requested and received extra toiletries. There is also a list at the front desk of items you can have/borrow/buy. No kettle in the room but I was able to borrow one. Refilled my water bottle at the gym. Got a local paper everyday from the lobby. On the 8th level, facing the hills, we don’t hear too much. And while there’s other families on our floor we don’t hear them either. The location, while pretty much at the end of the beach strip on the Diamond Head side, is in a great location. Just 2 blocks from the beach where there’s a retaining wall so that the water is gentle for kids. We borrowed hotel towels, chairs and kids toys from the front desk. It’s also 1 block away from the Zoo - we bought a membership so we could visit multiple times and go in & out as we pleased. Many great meal selections around, whether it’s açai bowls & coffee from Tucker & Bevvy across from the zoo, Morimoto’s Asia for their Happy Hour specials, and food trucks/hole-in-the-walls along Kuhio. And more food halls with International Marketplace & Waikiki Yokocho a little further down. Breakfast is great, for being included. Some of the items are swapped in/out on different days. Usually there’s scrambled eggs, a protein (sausage/bacon/ham), potatoes, waffles, toast station, hot oatmeal station, cold cereal station, fresh fruit, Asian foods (rice, miso soup, pickles, Kim chi, hard boiled eggs), juice. It is served in an outdoor setting, which is nice to eat al fresco, just shoo away the birds. If you don’t like that, a smaller variation of breakfast is served in the lobby. And there’s a tray in your room so you can take what your want and head back. One day there was very high wind so breakfast was served in the conference room - not quite the same laid back atmosphere as the open air setting!

As a World of Hyatt member and card holder, most of my travels leave me staying in Hyatts and this one was by far the worst and caused me to lose trust in the only brand name I felt I could consistently trust before. While the hotel room was generally clean it was quite run down. Several walls has chipped paint, the shower door was difficult to slide shut, and the shower drain was very slow to drain. The balcony directly overlooked another balcony that looked quite drab and offered no privacy. Overall we felt our room was a bit sad and didn’t want to spend any more time than we had to in there. The elevators in the building were very slow too. I live in a 70 story apartment building and waited longer for elevators in this 15 story hotel than I do at home. The hotel also charges a hefty resort fee and I cannot for the life of me figure out what that is covering. Parking is still extra (and valet only). The pool is very small and in no way a resort-style pool. Breakfast is included only for World of Hyatt members, so while that was nice I feel I pay for that separate from my resort fee. When I think of a resort I think of a hotel that in itself is a vacation experience, but this hotel was merely a bed for us. It wasn’t all bad though, I did feel our room was clean (a credit to the housekeeping staff) and the breakfast was better than I expected. These positives were not enough though, so I would say with all the choices in Waikiki stay elsewhere.",,Q8215CEsam,9,2.0

Always stayed in GREAT Hyatt Places during that time. Had a wonderful room on the top floor here - huge - bidet - lovely! This trip, no status, prepaid, and with a 17 month old in tow. We wound up in 1121, which is a TINY room with 2 double beds that consume the room. It had a wraparound balcony that was the only nice thing about the room. We barely fit our stroller, crib, and luggage in. I wish the check-in staff put us in a better room than the end of the hall too! When we first opened the fridge, it stunk so bad - it was turned off and there was someone else's food in there! The room and hotel definitely showed wear and tear. We both agreed we would not be coming back. Also, no easy access for the breakfast area with a stroller. We had to use the elevator in the kitchen. So glad when we finally left after three nights for our resort hotel on the big island. Probably should have refused the room at the start but we got in after a SEVEN hour delay at the airport and a 3 hr time zone difference.

From Canada’s, our dollar is nicknamed the Canadian peso right now. So saving here and there was essential on this trip. The breakfast for all of us was free as long as you are a Hyatt member. If this was not offered, we would have chosen a place with a kitchenette, which the Hyatt does not have. The staff were amazing and very accommodating. They offer beach chairs, beach towels, and beach chairs which saves you a lot there in Waikiki. The area is perfect. 1-2 blocks from the better family beach part of Waikik(not as busy, and has a seawall to keep the water calm). Stored and restaurant within walking distance. Has there own small restaurant with drnks but a little costly for us. Dominoes is attached, so that’s great if you need something quick for the kids. Room was large with decent view. The only thing for us was the parking. We rented a car for the first 3 nights. The parking lot is aleays full so you are forced to pay $35 USD for valet. But I found out that parking at the zoo is $1 per hour. It is only 3 blocks away so I parked it there for $9-$11 per night and just walked to and from.

When we got into 907, I could tell that the room was not freshened up and not quite ready for a new guest; a few missing bath towels, missing extra bedding linen for the sofa sleeper, mini-fridge was off, and the AC was not cooling down the room (worked more like a fan than an AC). I went to the front desk not necessarily to raise the issue about these room items, but I requested to have a higher floor since from my initial online booking, I had requested for a room at least on the 12th floor or higher. I spoke with Kimberly and she had no problem with providing a higher floor, but could not accommodate the higher room until the next day, which was fine by me and the family (we’re in Hawaii, so it’s not that bad). The next morning after breakfast, I went back to the front desk and spoke with Lisa Catherine, regarding the room situation. She immediately saw the request, and said that we were set to move to the new room 1107. She recognized that we had made plans to go out, and she said to go ahead and enjoy our daily plans, and the staff would move all our baggage and belongings to the new room. We returned later in the afternoon, again meeting with Lisa Catherine, and had our new room keys ready. When we entered into room 1107, all of our baggage and other belongings were set up in the room, the room was freshened up compared to the previous room (with a small welcome note from our housekeeper Leonida), and the view looking out our balcony and as so much better. Leonida took care of the little things we needed for our room, for our 6-night stay. Thank you especially to Kimberly, Lisa Catherine, and Leonida for making a good experience, a great experience.

City public bus route 19 stops in front of the hotel, and leaves from HNL; it takes an hour. This high-rise property is one block from the southern end of Waikiki Beach, one block from the actual southern end of the beach. The hotel has a slick feel of a modern, high-rise with a spacious open air lobby with natural stone finishes throughout the lobby, which adds a level of coolness, much appreciated stepping out of the heat of Honolulu. There is a huge sitting area with couches, a bar area serving light fare and drinks/coffee. The lobby is fronted by the valet leading to the reception desk. We arrived at 7pm and check-in was seamless, with the reception agent acknowledging our status with Hyatt, and upgrading us to an ocean-view room on a high floor. She also congratulated us on our honeymoon which was a nice touch. She didn’t, however, explain that complimentary beach towels were available at the reception, during the day, or offered us the slip we needed to grab the daily, complimentary bottles of water. The lobby is accessible to the public, but the elevators to the rooms can only be accessed with a room card. Your card key will give you access to the floor your room is on and the third floor, which houses the breakfast buffet/the pool area, as well as the gym and laundry area. The hotel lobby has a Domino’s Pizza directly but discreetly accessible through the lobby. There is an ABC convenience store just a few yards down the street from the hotel’s entrance, and the giant Marriott Property across the street (has car rental options for easy pick-up, Enterprise is the best option there). The beach front is a long block (few minute walk) from the hotel. There is self-serve parking here for $25 and valet for $35, but no in-out privileges. Street parking isn’t too tough around this property. Upon check-out, which was graciously extended to 2pm, we could store our suitcases in the lobby. The friendly clerk locks a great many suitcases with secure wire through the handles, using a bag check system.The room: Ours was a 12the floor room with two queen beds, facing the ocean. There was a small balcony with two chairs and a small table off the room with a decent view of the ocean. The sunset views were excellent. The room also had a seating area with an L-shaped sectional and a full size coffee table, a desk and a large flat panel TV with a mini-fridge below it. Conveniently and thoughtfully, a large tray was set on this coffee table for the purpose of taking breakfast to go, back to the room. There was a coffee maker in the room, no kettle for tea. The TV had all the cable channels one would want/expect and the complimentary WiFi worked well throughout the property. The large closet had a very large safe, great for laptops, unfortunately, its door fully obstructed the remaining half of the closet. The beds and bedding were comfortable. The sink/vanity with a large mirror was set just outside the shower/toilet room. This was a small but functional shower space, although with poor water pressure out of the shower-head and very slow drainage in the shower. The toiletries were basic; we brought our own. We once had an issue with the mini-fridge and needed a remote control replacement, and the repair man showed up promptly. The food: The large open air breakfast buffet has rooftop seating, some of it around the pool. There is a huge coffee/tea station then a U-shaped buffet with mainly continental, but also a few Asian options. Eggs and home fries are served daily but the choice of meat rotates, with ham, crispy bacon or tasty, local Kalua Pig on rotation. Yogurt, fresh fruit and cereals are also served daily, as is the miso soup, rice, kim-chi and tofu. There is orange and grapefruit juice available but oddly not the Hawaiian preferred Passion-fruit, Orange, Guava mix, or even just guava. On the weekends there are waffles or monkey bread as a treat. The open air seating is nice, but during times of rain and during gusty winds it’s not a functional eating space, good thing most of the time it’s sunny and calm out. Once while indulging some late night cravings, it was super convenient to grab a pizza from Domino's just off the lobby.The third floor: The pool is just beside the breakfast patio, on the rooftop of the second floor. The remaining part of the third floor is a small gym with cardio equipment and a small laundry room with many washers/dryers that take both coins and credit cards.All in all, it was great getting an upgrade to an ocean-view room on a high floor. The breakfast is a nice perk, and the setting and location is good as well. Being at the southern end of Waikiki, you are just a 10-20 minute walk from excellent beach to all the restaurants, shopping and sights of this glittering neighborhood. The southern end of Waikiki means much less densely packed beaches. Walk to the beach and hang a left along the oceanfront It’s 5-10 minutes to a great local beach park, Queen’s Beach, with its great wide lawn with plenty of shade from old growth trees with wide canopies. The sand is golden and soft here and the water is cleaner. There are showers available as well. Just bring your own beach gear to enjoy. The much busier part of the beach is 5-10 minutes to the right after walking down to the beach from the hotel, it’s the part with Duke Statue and giant trees. There are great Asian, local and American restaurants throughout this area 10-20 minute walk from the hotel. I would definitely consider this hotel for another stay in Waikiki, especially when it’s a cheaper rate.","New York City, New York","Brooklynite_Abroad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",834,5.0

But, most of all, the hotel staff that I had talked to were the best part of my stay in the hotel and possibly in the whole busy and crowded Waikiki beach. Our whole family stayed here for 12 nights and I was having trouble having a good sleep. I let the staff know the trouble and we had to change the room three times. And along the process they were very helpful and considerate. Angeline, Eian, Cliff,Dino and Lisa at the front desk were so nice and did their best to give me a quieter room. And Janis from house keeping was very thorough and cooperative with my special request to clean the bathroom with vinegar water. And Erna at the breakfast cafe was always smiley and kind. This is still a great hotel with wonderful wonderful people and worth staying at but, if you are light sleeper, be sure to bring quality ear plugs and hope the management of the hotel puts better sliding doors to keep the street noise out so that you can get a good night’s sleep. And Lisa! You were so nice to my 5 year old. And I want to say this again! Can you be his grandma? Mahalo to every hard working staff in the hotel !!!!!You guys are the best!!!!!

It is conveniently located just a block away from Waikiki Beach. Our stay was pleasant but not perfect. Our room was clean and very quiet, a big plus! The main negative aspect was the slow elevators - there are only two for the entire complex. The wait can sometimes be frustratingly long. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet, but we were only offered it for free after we agreed to join the Hilton Members Club. The staff was helpful for the most part. There were a few mistakes, however, that should not have happen in such a high-quality hotel. There were five of us, but the sleeper sofa had neither a blanket nor a pillow case. When we requested those items, we were told that they were out and that we should use bath towels! After another call explaining that my daughter was unable to sleep, we finally received those items. The concierge desk is often swamped and the wait can be long. We prebooked several excursions before we arrived, but the packet was not given to us at check-in, so this caused us to wait an hour the next day just to pick them up from the single concierge. Again, it was a good stay, but not a perfect one.","North Kansas City, Missouri","Doc-Rocketman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Kansas City, Missouri</strong>",57,4.0

They promote breakfast for world Hyatt members but in fact everyone gets it. There is no checking so people bring friends in from other hotels as well. The breakfast area is mostly open so birds fly in and attack any food left unattended and when it rained there was only 5 tables under cover to accommodate everyone. The food is very basic and extremely limited in choices. Felt like I was at a school camp having to take my plates to the bench and scrap them down and stack them- plastic plates as well- not even crockery. As for the pool- in the entire time I never saw or heard of anyone using it.. Why... well it is about 6 meters by 4 meters, old and absolutely no atmosphere around it. Stuck in the breakfast area with no view. Our mountain view room faced the building opposite’s car park and only when you looked around the corner of your small balcony could you see it. Our lady who cleaned our room did a good job and took pride in her work. If you pay the destination fee of $15 per day use it to get your 1 coffee a day so much better than the breakfast crap upstairs. When getting the cab back to the airport check before you get in that the driver is aware that it is a flat rate of $29 as otherwise they try and get you to pay the full fare which can be anything higher than $50.As I person who stays in many Hyatt Hotels this one falls very much below the usual standard in so many ways.

Staff are under trained in delivering what they promise. The food quality and variety is sorely lacking. Although breakfast was included on this trip, I only ate breakfast at the hotel twice (2) in the 7 days that I stayed. The food at breakfast was of poor quality and not of the standard expected of the Hyatt or a 4 star hotel. Presentation and food variety was poor: I found the waffles under cooked, pancakes dry and tasteless, the roasted vegetables were also over cooked and dry. The only choice of eggs was scrambled ( which I don't like), the fruit variety lacking (only pineapple and melons) and cut into big chunks. Where were the bananas and berries, apples or grapes? Only paper cups provided for coffee and tea instead of proper ceramic cups??? Come on Hyatt, you can do much better. Table service was lacking as we had to clear our own plates. I HAD MORE VARIETY AND BETTER SERVICE AT IHOP WHICH IS WHERE I WENT FOR BREAKFAST for the other 5 days! The way I see it, the Hyatt place owes me $100 US for breakfast, which is what I spent for the 5 days! Thank God for iHop and the ABC store around the corner!

The location was good being at the southend of the beach and therefore a little less busy/crowded. Every member of the hotel staff we encountered were friendly, helpful and engaging. The hotel amenities are decent--there was a small computer area which I used for airline check-in, the workout rooms and pool area are small but serviceable. The breakfast on the 3rd floor outdoor deck was great--good selection of hot and cold items as well as some Asian fare (Miso soup, kimchee, etc.). The room was very large (we got a free upgrade with a partial ocean view) and comfortable and modern. It was easy for our family to spread out our belongings and still have room. The large safe in the closet was also convenient to store all of our electronics and valuables while we were out. The noise level was decent, but you can clearly hear the nearby doors closing shut. The only complaint I would have is the elevators- security feature where your room card would only allow you to select the floor where your room is located was cool. However, with only 2 slow elevators the wait for the elevators were very long and often full especially in the morning when a lot of folks are heading to the breakfast buffet. I used the stairs (we were on the 7th floor) often. I guess the elevators were on ""island time"".

It's not insanely expensive, like the hotels that are right on the beachfront, but it's a very short walk to the beach. It doesn't have the fabulous views, either (although if you request Diamond Head view, that side is pretty nice), but you save a bundle vs. the beachfront hotels which you can then use on dining, tours and shopping. The staff is responsive, the rooms are updated and clean, the breakfast is decent, and you are close enough to walk to everything in Waikiki. An additional plus: being on the east end of Waikiki is a bit quieter and you might be able to score cheap parking in Kapiolani Park -- you can walk from there.

From here, buses can take you to just about all the important destinations, including the huge Ala Moana Shopping Centre, the Iolani Palace, the Bishop Museum, the Mission Houses Museum, Pearl Harbour or the Waikele Premium Outlets. Bus no 2 seems to be the most popular one going to many of these destinations. The trolley buses do their pickups and drop-offs outside the Aston Hotel, just down the road from the Hyatt, another plus for this location. We used the pink trolley many times to get to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre and back again (just $2 a ride). There are numerous ABC Stores close by, the nearest one, on Paoakalani Av, is just a few metres from the front entrance. The ABC Stores, by the way, are the greatest invention since sliced bread: You can buy everything you need there, from clothing to souvenirs, liquor, food, toiletries, snacks etc. And they’re open from early till late every day of the week. Keep your receipts and when you hit $100, you’ll be rewarded with a free bag or a calendar worth 99c! (I guess this is their version of a Rewards program). It’s about a five minute walk to the beach, or 15 minute walk to the famous Moana Surfrider Hotel and the Royal Hawaiian Centre, which seem to me the centre of Waikiki.ROOMAfter spending our first night in a rather small and pokey room on level 11, we were upgraded to room 1006, a much smarter, larger and more elegant room, one floor below, and we couldn’t have been happier. It was huge, airy and light, and with everything in it that we needed. It was just around the corner from the lifts, another big plus, meaning that there was no long walking down the corridors every time we left or returned to our room. It was peaceful and quiet. We hardly heard any noise, either from inside, or from the traffic below us, and we slept well every night. The room featured:- Two large, comfortable double beds- Expansive views of the district, with the mountains in the background- Huge LG TV that could swivel around, so that you could watch it either from the lounge area, or while lying in bed- Three lights strategically positioned in the lounge area, plus a desk lamp and two bedside lamps, all providing decent illumination for reading or writing- A bar fridge, a coffee machine, a few tea bags, but no kettle,and no instant coffee or coffee creamer sachets. But you can buy a small jar of coffee to keep in your room from any of the numerous ABC Stores all around the place, and just grab your milk sachets from breakfast- A single bedside table between the two beds, but with no drawer underneath - Masses of storage space in a four drawer cabinet opposite the bed (it also served as the TV table). Drawers were huge and there are two shelves on the opposite side- A cupboard behind the basin in the “open plan” part of the bathroom. It had two sliding doors which I found a tad stiff, and the cupboard itself was awkward and small. - Some hangers are provided, but the best feature of the cupboard though, was the huge safe at the bottom- Separate sitting or lounge area, which had a generous three-seater sofa with a footrest, a single chair, a handy desk and chair, with aforementioned desk lamp, and a little coffee table- Air con- Two small balconies, each one with a table and two chairs, although too narrow really to be of any practical use, and I also found the railing to be too low for comfort- One case stand- Plenty of power points in convenient locations, to charge all your devicesCompared to our first room, this one was a winner, and thanks to the staff for upgrading us. It made our holiday so much more pleasant and comfortable. BATHROOMI found the bathroom config a bit strange. The toilet and shower (no bath) were behind a solid locking door, but the wash basin is in front of that, in a kind of open plan arrangement. Now I’m the kind of guy that values my privacy in the bathroom, so having the solid locking door, and a toilet and shower set well away from the sleeping area, was a big plus, but the “open plan” basin irked me. I couldn’t understand why they just couldn’t have put the whole thing, including the wash basin, behind the locked door? The shower was fully enclosed in a large cubicle, with strong water pressure, and a sturdy, three quarter glass door to prevent spillage onto the floor. It took me awhile to figure out that the water pressure from the shower head is adjusted by turning the head itself, but once I got the flow right, it was perfect. Water pressure in the basin though was weak and it seemed to take ages to fill it. A small quantity of toiletries was supplied and replenished daily. SERVICEThis is where these guys really excel. Service from all the hotel staff, from the cleaners to the “gallery hosts” (i.e. the guys working on the front desk), the concierge, bartenders, bell boys etc was friendly, polite and efficient. They inspire confidence and look neat and tidy in their smart uniforms. We were made to feel welcome the moment we walked into the lobby. When our Jetstar flight arrived from Syd at 6.00am, we were at the hotel just after 7.00am, pretty exhausted, but fully expecting to have to wait around till 2.00pm or even 3.00pm to be able to check in. We were in for pleasant surprise though. The helpful lady at reception who attended to us, allowed us to go up to our room straight away, after enjoying the free breakfast. What a pleasure that was, to be able to unpack, shower, freshen up and have a nice snooze before going out and exploring what Waikiki had to offer. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, and any requests, such as for extra toiletries or being able to check-out the night before departure or extra room cards etc were handled promptly and politely. They also have a handy concierge desk in the lounge area, where you can ask the staff member on duty, questions about where to go, what to do etc and they’ll also book tours for you. On their recommendation, we booked an excursion to Hanauma Bay and were very happy with that tour. Our room was cleaned daily to a high standard and the cleaners always ensured that we had plenty of supplies of toiletries. The bell captain and his two assistants at the front, were another useful contact point for basic information such as where to get the bus, which bus to catch etc. And what pleasant and polite guys they were, no matter who was on duty: Always cheerful, smiling and willing to assist. BREAKFASTBreakfast is usually served on the pool deck on level 3. If it’s raining, it will be served downstairs on the ground level. We were pleased to have the free brekky thrown in, when we weren’t expecting it. And everything on offer was fresh, wholesome and tasty, with something for everyone, including fruit, cereals, juices, bread and rolls, sausages, coffee, tea etc. We found the space at the pool deck though to be a bit uncomfortable and overcrowded, and often it was difficult to find somewhere to sit. Staff did their best to keep up, but sometimes we had to wait for new supplies of clean crockery or fresh coffee to arrive. On windy mornings, it was a real challenge to stop everything - from serviettes to paper cups, hats etc - from blowing away, and creating a litter problem. The pigeons were a real nuisance too, ready to swoop on a vacant table and gobble up the leftovers the moment a guest left. Although again, staff did their best - and full marks to them - to keep things flowing smoothly. On our first morning at the Hyatt, it was raining, so breakfast was served indoors on the ground floor, and we found that a more pleasant and relaxed experience; rather than having to eat outdoors in the overcrowded pool area, at the mercy of the elements. Breakfast is served until 9.30am on weekdays and until 10.00am on weekends, but we felt that it should be till 10.00am on all days. Being in a laid back holiday mood, we often slept late and struggled to make it to the pool deck by 9.30am!COMMON AREASSwimming PoolThe pool is on level three. It was a bit of a disappointment, being about the size of a large bathtub. We didn’t bother using it, especially since there is no separate kiddies pool, and I’m not a great fan of sharing swimming pools with young kids. It just didn’t seem like the healthiest space to be putting my head into. Surfaces are quite slippery too.Wi-FiFree wi-fi throughout the hotel. It worked well and was fast and reliable.LiftsThree lifts in our tower. Generally there wasn’t any long waiting for them, and they worked efficiently to get us quickly and safely to your floor and back down again, each time. There’s no light though to indicate which lift was arriving, so one needed to be alert and watching the doors like a hawk.GymThere is a fully equipped gym on the same level as the pool.LaundryThe all-important self service laundry is also on level 3, but in the second tower. To access it from our tower, was a bit of a mission, requiring us to walk through the slippery, wet swimming pool area, through the gym and finally into the laundry, with card access required at each point.There are only three washing machines and three dryers, which is simply not adequate for a place the size of the Hyatt, and we always struggled to find available machines. It became a hassle to have to schlep our washing from level 10, to the laundry on level 3, through all the aforementioned entry and exit points, only to find that no machines were available, then schlep our washing back to our room and try again later. This hotel really needs to double the capacity of it’s guest laundry facilities. When you do however, find an available machine, they’re easy to operate. The cost is $3 for a wash and $3 for a half-hour dry cycle which is usually sufficient for a small load. I found it quite handy to be able to pay with my cc, rather than hunt around for small change and here’s a small miracle: The price you see is the price you pay! No extra levies, taxes, surcharges or gratuities, so $3 it is for a wash or a dry, nothing more to pay. It’s useful having this facility in the hotel, rather than having to take one’s washing to an outside laundromat (if one can find one), so I guess that one should be grateful for that, because not all hotels have them, but we did find it a frustrating experience each time having to wait for a machine to become available.Lounge area and lobbyDownstairs on the ground floor is a bar and lounge area. It’s a cool and comfy space with a homely, laid back and relaxed ambience. There are soft upholstered chairs or firm wooden chairs and tables, a couple of TV screens and newspapers, with both the local “Honolulu Star- Advertiser” and the “Wall Street Journal” available free of charge. We found it the perfect place to chill out, read the newspapers, or just sit and watch the passing parade. You can also order food and drink. The bar has some happy hours deals from 5-7pm nightly. I enjoyed a pint (that’s about 475ml in Aussie speak or slightly bigger than a schooner) of local ale for just under $6. Sometimes, we bought our dinners at the local ABC store and made ourselves comfortable and ate at one of the tables, and no-one seemed to mind. Also, just in front of the reception area, are a couple of easy chairs and tables so you can hang out there as well, although it’s not quite as relaxed, because it can get pretty hectic, with new arrivals, people waiting for their pickups etc. All the common areas are clean, tidy and well maintained. There are toilets just in front of the lifts, as well as a couple of computers for guests to use free of charge (you just need to get a code from one of the gallery hosts).DESTINATION FEES & CARD HOLDSJust a word about my experience with “destination fees” and credit card holds. When I checked in, a hold was put on my credit card for $225, being the $25 a day deposit for nine days. This was no surprise, and I was expecting it. However, I wasn’t expecting that another charge, this time for $210 would be put on my card a day or two later. When I queried this, I was told that it was the “destination fee”. But nowhere on my booking form, nor in any comms that I had with the hotel, was anything mentioned about a “destination fee”. I protested to the gallery host about it. She explained to me that the hotel now charged all guests this fee to cover things like free wi-fi and who knows what else, but obviously, it’s just a rather sneaky method for the hotel to recoup the commission it pays to the booking agency. (And congrats to the Hyatt’s P.R. dept or whoever came up with this fancy, but rather meaningless term: “destination fee”. In Las Vegas they call it a “resort fee” but since the Hyatt isn’t really a resort, I guess they had to dream up another term for it). However, in view of the fact that it was never explained to me and was not part of my contract with the booking agency, the gallery host agreed to cancel it. But that was not the only nasty surprise. On checkout, I was presented with another bill, this time for $100, which the gallery host claimed was also a “destination fee”. Again I protested, and on further checking, it transpired that the “destination fee” only came into effect in April of this year (2018), whereas my booking was made in January. More apologies and another cancellation. But it all left a sour taste in my mouth. And to cap it all off, on the the day that I left I noticed yet another hold on my card for $225, which I presumed was simply a duplication of the original deposit. So I left the hotel with holds on my card totalling $660, being two deposits of $225 each and a false destination fee of $210. Within a day, $435 had been removed from hold, but as of this writing, I am still attempting to have the last hold of $225 removed. My card company advised me that it would take a month for the hold to be released, although I can’t say whether that it their fault or the hotel’s.SUMMARYWe spent nine nights here in Sept and on the whole, apart from the schmozzle with the extra charges and cc holds, everything went smoothly. We were upgraded to a fabulous room that we loved, with a nice view and all the comforts we could ask for. Service was outstanding at all levels, and the location is convenient. Free wi fi and brekky are an added plus, but just watch out for the “destination fee”. The pool isn’t great, but with the beach just a few metres down the road, you’ll hardly need it and it’s best left for the kiddies to enjoy. We loved hanging out in the lounge area downstairs. Having an on-site laundromat was useful, when you could score a machine to use. The place is clean and well maintained throughout and hums along like a well oiled machine.","Sydney, Australia","Artfornodriving</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",233,4.0

That is why I picked Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach. Although not disappointed with the hotel, most of us determined that we would not stay in Waikiki Beach again. Sadly, the homeless population is quite high although I never felt unsafe, there were several incidents when you just had to cross the street or be very observant of your surroundings.As far as the Hyatt Place. When we booked they weren't imposing the destination fee, so that was another reason for choosing this hotel along with the free breakfast.Dino checked us in and provided great customer service. Some rooms, the sleeper is just a chair and not a sofa. My sister, brother-in-law and niece requested to be moved to a double queen and they got a very nice upgrade.Our housekeeper on the 6th floor of the Diamond Head Tower was excellent and very friendly. Breakfast provided enough variety, although I would have liked to seen turkey meat products, more fruit and pastries.It is conveniently located to: the beach, bus line, ABC, restaurants, shopping and the zoo. A Domino's Pizza is connected off the lobby and some in our group took advantage of that a couple times.We rented a van for part of our stay and if you're willing to ride around for about 15 mins or so, you can find free parking in the area.

One of the selling features was the complimentary hot breakfast & location, location, location!!We arrived around 11pm on a Wednesday night. We had a fantastic ocean view room on the PH floor (aka 20th floor).CHECK IN: Our ""hired"" VIP airport transfer vehicle broke down a few blocks away from the hotel so the driver unloaded our 3 bags of luggage and told us to walk. Tori Cook welcomed us & got us checked in. After dropping our bags off in the room, we headed to the lobby bar for some food & drinks. Erin Lum was our bartender/chef. ROOM: Our room was very clean, well maintained and spacious. More than we were expecting. And how about that bidet.....first experience with that feature & we're now looking at one for our home!!BREAKFAST: best complimentary hot breakfast we've had with good variety and early enough that you could get in/out & carry on with your day. We did have an issue with the scrambled eggs not being a little under done but when we mentioned this to the front desk they were very quick to apologize and offer to ""make it up"" to us. This was above and beyond...we were simply letting them know to avoid others from a possible upset tummy.POOL: pool deck didn't have enough loungers however I can appreciate that the space is shared with tables to accommodate the breakfast crowd. It was nice to be able to bring your own drinks to the pool....REMEMBER NO GLASS BY THE POOL!!! You know who you are....VALET: we had a vehicle for 4 of our 10 days. Valet was efficient however we did find it strange that the radio was on in the morning when we specifically had it turned off so we could hear ""Siri"" giving us directions.....EXTENDED CHECK OUT: our departure flight wasn't until 10pm. The hotel graciously gave us a very late check out of 2pm at no extra charge. We opted to pay a half day rate to keep the room until 6pm so we didn't have to store our luggage.Overall experience was great with this hotel!

For this trip I leveraged my World of Hyatt points for a five-night stay.

After she texted me I let her know I did not have Internet and she connected me with the support staff who was very nice and helpful in getting my devices connected. - Very grateful my room was ready early when I checked in around 10:30 AM since my flight arrived an hour early.Room - Bigger and more spacious than I expected (had the double Queen room). Additionally, the partial ocean view and balcony was a nice bonus I was not expecting. - Appreciated everything was clean and in working order. - Service staff were very friendly and smiled.Breakfast - Great breakfast with a variety of options, even for the health conscious. - Really neat they offer miso soup, rice, and tofu as a breakfast item.Location - Less than 5 min walk to the beach and towels are provided by the front desk. - Walking distance to a lot of food and shopping.A few improvement suggestions for the hotel: - Add a power tower in the gym (simple piece of equipment that doesn’t take up much space that allows for pullups, dips, leg raises, etc.). - Be nice if there was a microwave or two in the lobby for guests instead of having to ask the staff and/or include them in the rooms. - Complimentary bottled water was offered as a daily perk for being a loyalty member (I believe you have to be at least Discoverist). It would be nice if the water was included/restocked in the room instead of having to ask in the lobby.Overall, I would stay at this hotel again and it contributed to a relaxing, solo, recharge trip.

So when I arrived I was really impressed with the lobby. Awesome scene. open air. The staff was amazing. We did arrive about hour ahead of schedule they tried to check us in however our room was not ready. however we only waited 15 minutes and they had the room ready. Of course this was at the height of summer vacation so they had alot of guest. TIP:Make your flight reservations closer to check in time. Once we got to the room it was very nice. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The size of the room was fine. Of course we are not in Hawaii to stay in our rooms. The breakfast is awesome, it can get pretty busy but they have enough staff to make sure everything is kept full. TIP: They have a tray in the room you can bring down if you want to eat in your room. The pool is small but the beach is steps away so we did not use the pool. I read in previous reviews about the elevators were slow. We did not experience that. At times they were small waits but nothing to complain about at all. Now if you are renting a car plan on valet parking fee. I think it's $30 a day but you can call the hotel on the exact amount. There is no place to park, valet is the best choice. There is a parking structure across the street that is cheaper. I did not bother to check the fees but someone said it is cheaper. they do have beach chairs for rent. I did ask the front desk for beach chairs and was told it was extra and it came in some package. I suggest calling about that if you plan on hanging out at the beach and want chairs.All and all this is a great place to stay the staff is very helpful to make sure your stay is comfortable as possible. There is a convenient store very close. TIP: the Hawaii charges for store bags 10 cents if you dont want to pay 10 cents for a plastic bag bring one.

The breakfast buffet was one of the best I've been to. Seating was on the hotel terrace, but there was also indoor seating available.

We got a text when it was which was convenient. She enquired as to why we were staying there again, which is for my wife’s 50th birthday and we also had friends staying in the same hotel. Our room is spacious by any standards and even more so by Waikiki standards. Nice king size bed, sofa, desk, balcony with table and chairs and standard size bathroom. It is well maintained by housekeeping. The view to the ocean between 2 other buildings is still spectacular. You can see marine craft, planes and surfers while sitting on the balcony. Location is excellent. Walking distance to virtually anywhere. Couple of hundred metres to the beach and the Pink Line shuttle bus stop is very close by where you can get to Ala Moana shopping centre for $2.Now the reason for knocking off 1 star. If the check in staff think it’s relevant or important to ask for a reason for your stay and that reason is relatively important to you (ie my wife’s 50th) then you think they might recognise that on the day.

And so far this hotel has the BEST customer service with great staff and I had such a pleasant stay during my stay. I actually didn’t know about this place until I had to use my Hyatt anniversary night coupon which expires soon, so I decided to give it a try. I flew from South Korea, landed at 9 am, dead tired so I was hoping they let me check in at no extra cost. I used Hyatt Express check in app informing my arrival time would be 11 am, and even before I arrived at hotel at 10ish, I was informed that my room was ready! So I got to hotel, short line for check in, got to my room. As a Hyatt elite member, I get late check out as one of benefits but it’s subject to availability and hotels in Waikiki never let me take that benefit because it’s always busy here but Hyatt Place Waikiki guaranteed my late check out without hesitation. so I really appreciate that.  Location: One~two blocks from Waikiki so it’s super convenient to go to the beaches and other places. ABC store is located next door and there is Domino’s on the first floor so I loved having my late night snack.  Parking: This is VERY important as overnight parking in Waikiki is crazy expensive! Valet is $35 and self parking is $25 but self parking wasn’t available due to space. HOWEVER, you can park at the Honolulu Zoo for $1 per hour, and you can even renew the time via mobile. It’s only one block away so it was really convenient! Instead of paying $25-35 per night, we only paid $10 for overnight parking.  Breakfast: BEST!!! free breakfast is served to all guests, which you can hardly see in Waikiki area. Breakfast is so good and had varieties from Asian (Kimchi, rice, miso soup) to continental.  Staff: Everyone is so nice and makes you feel so welcomed as you walk in. Supervisor Jade is always there to make sure the guests are not having any issues. Angeline, who helped me with check in, and Eian who helped me with check out process were so helpful!  Overall: I am definitely coming back here next time I am in HI, and will also recommend all of my friends and family this place when they come visit. Thank you for your great service and hospitality.  <Korean> 가성비 최고의 호텔입니다.  우선 수영장이 있긴 있는데 작다보니 리조트피를 따로 안 받아서 돈 세이브가 많이 됐고요, 어차피 와이키키 해변이 바로 한블락 떨어져있어서 해변에서 놀면되서 수영장 안가게 됩니다.  주차도 너무 좋았던게 와이키키 주차가 무진장 비싼데 (평균 $30정도) 여긴 호놀룰루 동물원에 주차하시면 되고 한시간에 1불 밖에 안합니다. 즉 하루 왠종일해도 $24 밖에 안해요. 낮에는 차타고 놀다가 밤에 들어와서 자고 다시 아침에 나가니 주차비가 $10 밖에 안 들어서 너무 좋았습니다.  아침식사도 매우 훌륭합니다. 무료제공치고 종류도 많고 든든하고.. 무엇보다 흰쌀밥과 김치, 된장국이 있어서 하루를 든든히 시작할 수 있어서 좋았네요.  방은 어떤 방에 배정받느냐에 따라 크기가 다른데 우선 퀸침대 2개 들어가있는 방들은 대부분 다 커서 한가족 지내시는데 문제 없을 겁니다. 소파도 침대소파 (더블사이즈) 전환가능해서 성인 6명까지 주무실 수 있으세요.  암튼 와이키키해변 호텔 중 가성비 너무 좋았던 호텔이고 다음에도 또 방문할 예정입니다.",,spice777,6,5.0

The hotel website says they charged $25 a night for self parking but upon arrival we were told they had valet parking only for $35 a night. We parked in a garage directly across the street which is $30 a night or $110 for a week but they only accept cash but it is well worth it if you are staying 4 nights or more. Free breakfast every morning on the 3rd floor which is outside dining. The room is rather small with not much area to put your luggage but the rooms come with a small balcony. Overall you are paying for the location but the Hyatt Place is always a good place to stay.,Indiana,"Barbara K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Indiana</strong>",16,4.0

The rooms/bed were clean comfortable, and the staff super friendly. I read a complaint or two before about the elevators; we did not have a problem with them at all. There are two separate set of elevators, one set of two elevators in the front by guest check-in/out, and another set of three elevators further behind around the corner by the two gift shops. We stayed at a time that seemed rather crowded, we were told there were about 1300 guests at the time, but everything seemed to run smoothly, even if the breakfast you enjoyed for free got crowded. Well done organizing the by staff to separate it into the 1st and 3rd floor for breakfast to accommodate the crowd, and also allow one to bring breakfast back to your room. Finally, I thought the selection of breakfast was great from hot oatmeal, miso soup, scrambled eggs to toast, pancakes, waffles (it's only pancakes or waffles, and not both on any given day). We stayed here for five nights and the breakfast turned out to be a very welcome value. Would definitely stay here again; it's only 3 short block from the beach, great location. Valet and cleaning and all staff really, were very friendly and helpful. One negative: our room was by the elevators, or the front of a hall. I don't know if it's like this for other rooms, but it seemed like you could hear the wind wooshing through the hall, and it was rather loud. By the 2nd or 3rd day, we got over it, must've gotten used to it. But something I thought I should mention it. Oh, finally, if you have more than two guests in your room, plan to bring small toiletries, as there are not a lot to share. I was surprised no Q-tips or cotton balls were provided. I have just come to expect that at hotels.","Torrance, California","phamtc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Torrance, California</strong>",10,5.0

We were already happy with the hotel, we were more than happy after the threat of the storm was past.This hotel is located just off the main drag of Waikiki. It is a very short walk to the beach, the zoo, and a slightly longer walk (half mile?) to the aquarium. Are you traveling with elementary school or younger kids? This place provides a very good value and a great location particularly for families. There are a couple of elementary schools and parks quite close by, which means playgrounds for when they are antsy. The beach directly in front of the hotel is sheltered by a breaker wall, and there is a lifeguard station right there. The hotel has an ample, filling breakfast included for all guests, which is ideal for kids who one day wake up starving and another eat nothing at all. Many, many kid-friendly options like pancakes or waffles every day, cereal, milk and juice, eggs, and a rotating protein. It is served on the third and first floors -- definitely go to the third. More options are out, and it is kind of stuffy in the lobby where it is cooler and breezy on the third floor by the small pool. Free wifi. A dominoes pizza outlet IN the lobby. If you have less than adventurous eaters who need to be periodically run around the park to keep them from exploding, this is absolutely your place.It is comfortable as well. The beds were awesome, we all slept like the dead. The layout of the rooms differs slightly, I liked the one with a small partition between the bed area and a sitting area, rather than the couch facing one of the beds. That second layout is larger, but less convenient. The former has more counter space and cubbies for storing items and is better functionally for hanging out in the room (which one should avoid in better weather, of course!). Diamond Head Tower has a much better elevator set up -- worth paying for if the room option is more expensive. Three elevators service just something like 125 rooms in that tower, whereas there are 2 serving more like 186 rooms in the other tower.The staff were uniformly simply fantastic. Second time at the small, in-hotel bar and they remember you. They showed up without question during the storm threat, and breakfast kept appearing like clockwork while the whole city was shut down.There are very few eating options in the bar, but a vast universe of everything from dives and food trucks to expensive steak houses awaits you just out your door.I would definitely book this again, we were very happy with the hotel in all respects at a much more reasonable price than two giant chain properties very nearby.","Norfolk, Virginia","Lampshady</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Norfolk, Virginia</strong>",12,5.0

I stayed at the Prince Waikiki hotel 3 nights prior to this hotel (read my review comments on that one) and should not have moved! This hotel is closer to the Waikiki beach area (though not in front of the beach. Lobby looks faded and old, and as you walk to the elevator you notice that things don't look better. The worst part was arriving at my floor (i think i was placed in level 4), there was a loud fan aiming to dry up a wet carpet outside the elevator. The carpet looked old, the fan looked old and loud : ( anyways, walked to my room hoping for a decent space...wrong again. The room was old-looking, the shower was unimpressive. Didn't order any room service as I didn't trust the quality of the cuisine by the look and feel of the hotel (or motel?). Anywho, avoid this place travellers. Certainly the price per night of $260 AUD (~$200 USD) was not worth it! Pay extra $100 AUD ($70 usd) per night and you'll find muuuuch better quality hotel experiences that would make your Hawaii experience much more pleasant. Almost forgot, breakfast was free, but as soon as i saw the buffet quality (or lack thereof) I immediately left running to a Waikiki nearby restaurant.

First off, the location is one of the best things about this hotel. You are a seven minute walk to the best part of Waikiki beach, the Honolulu Zoo and several eateries. Many tour buses also stop near this hotel. The hotel staff were very wonderful and accommodating. I had great chats with the front desk and the bar staff on quite a few nights.The rooms are fair. Nothing spectacular, but you will find them more roomy than most hotels in the price range. Each room has a fridge, but no microwave. The free breakfast each more was good and can save you money in the long room. The pool was small and could become quite crowded quickly. There are some negatives to the hotel that I encountered. First, the inconsistent house keeping. During my stay, they would come any time of day from early morning to late afternoon or even not at all. Twice, I had to ask the front desk for more toilet paper and was told it would be brought to my room. It never came, so I had to buy some of my own. The second is the noise on rooms that face the street or the pool. I can usually ignore most city sounds, but my window was so poorly sealed that all the traffic sounded like it was coming in through an open window. I also heard the garbage truck every day when it came at 6 a.m. so getting a restful sleep was not possible. The solution would be to use the single pair of ear plugs the hotel provided, but that could also block out possible fire alarms. My friends reported the same issue on the pool side, which became quite loud when people were horsing around. The air conditioning in my daughters' room never worked fully, but the room was bearable. The elevators are extremely slow and you find yourself waiting for a while.All in all, it was an okay stay, but I will be exploring other options on return visits.","Ottawa, Canada","WyllPrime</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",18,3.0

The hotel's entire staff is very friendly, welcoming and professional. The amenities at this hotel include the included breakfast, which in Waikiki can become a major expense for a family with children. The third floor breakfast area is large enough to accommodate the ample about of guest staying at this property. I also used their computers to print multiple items downstairs. While there is a $15 per day resort charge, you get a $5 per day credit out of it at the lobby snack area, so we purchased something small like a soda or water each day with it, the ginger beers and root beers were very tasty! The pool on the third floor was on the small side, but we really did not come to Hawaii to swim in a hotel pool, so that was no issue for us.We had a mountain view room, which in hindsight was a partial mountain view room, blocked by some of the surrounding high-rise hotels and buildings. Still not a bad view. The room was large, with two queen beds and a sofa bed. Housekeeping promptly brought a pack and play (FYI-not a crib) to our room for our toddler, which he slept and played in with no issue. House keeping was fantastic, including having to completely change one of our beds due to an accident. There was not a bathtub in the bathroom, only a stand-up shower. The room had a small fridge, but no microwave. There is a large room safe also in the room. ABC Store located right next door for drinks and snacks if needed. Grab beach towels in the lobby from the front desk. We used them daily for the beaches we went to around the island. It saves you the trouble of either bringing your own towels and/or purchasing towels. Valet parking is $45 a day. There was not self parking available and good luck finding overnight parking in Waikiki within a reasonable walking distance of the hotel. The valet workers did do a great job in getting the vehicles quickly and giving advice on local beaches etc, and they were tipped well. Overall, a great hotel with a great staff and $45 a day valet parking.

The room itself was spotless, and the housekeeping service was terrific. Every personnel I met during my stay there was pleasant and accommodating. The gym provided more than enough equipment options to have a full workout routine, and the size was roomy without feeling cramped. The laundry room was very small but did not have a problem getting a load in during my stay. The free breakfast was fantastic! Each day provided different mains plus your standard eggs and sides. The daily credit of $5.00 from the bar offered me a complimentary latte, which was a nice added benefit.Lastly, the phone call from the general manager of the hotel was an unexpected gesture of a warm welcome.

Rather than making us wait for the room to be fully cleaned, the staff bumped us up to the next size room. We were satisfied both that we did not have to wait and a little extra space in the new room made things better also. Housekeeping kept the room clean without any issues.The breakfast bar on the 3rd floor is respectable in terms of the cross-section of food offered. The only challenge with breakfast is finding a table at times.They do have a pool on the 3rd floor and it is small. Fortunately there is that whole ocean thing just down the way. It is a short walk (2-3 easy blocks) to the beach from the hotel and handy to lots of tourist type shops if such things interest you. For us it was a place to stay at night as we did other things in variuos directions on Oahu.Plan on slow elevators. We took the stairs frequently versus waiting for the elevator to arrive. Sometimes it seemed like only one of the two was working.If you rent a car and bring it here, be prepared to pay a lot for valet parking.

Having stayed at Hyatt Places in California we had an idea of what to expect. A clean room, a decent buffet breakfast all at fair price. When I mean fair price I take into consideration the surrounding hotel rate in the area. Don’t expect the complimentary breakfast to be similar to ones that your pay for. The breakfast consists of scrambled eggs, at times watery, a meat (Sunday=sausage, Monday=bacon, Tuesday=biscuits and sausage gravy), cut fruit, toast, pancakes or waffles, cereal, rice, juices, milk, tea or coffee. Food was more than adequate for the daily room rate. The room was larger than we expected. The room had two queen beds, a sofa bed, desk, small frig, a worn dresser with plenty of room to spares. We have stayed at the Marriott across the street and the beds and room were much smaller at a higher price. Waikiki is a busy area with lots of traffic noise. Being on the 19th floor was just high enough so that the overall street noise was barely audible with the balcony door closed. With the door open the noise is crazy. That is not to say that our stay was perfect. We stayed in the main tower and at times the elevators took a long to arrive. There are only two elevators, which are small, and the staff also uses them. Also when we were checking in we were told that there was no valet parking available and that I should park at the Waikiki Banyan condos. Not good. I ended up parking at the Banyan parking for my entire stay since it was $30 for a 24hr period, was a short walk and had plenty of parking. Note that the hotel valet parking is $35 a day.The hotel is an easy walk to all of the Waikiki area. I would definitely consider staying at the Hyatt Place again.

If we did, then we wouldn’t have stayed there for that long. She looked at us and repeated it saying ‘it’s a hospitality room only for half hour and that we would usually have to pay but this time she will let us off’ Excuse me??? Why are you speaking to us so rudely like we stayed in that room for long on purpose? We would have left after half hour if someone had mentioned it to us.

The price was pretty reasonable too. We had 2 Queen Beds, Ocean View Specialty but not sure what the specialty was supposed to signify as the view was pretty damned crap (see photo). Being on a higher floor (we were on the 7th) may have been better. The first thing that springs to mind here is 'sticky'. Its fairly modern but its not clean, in every corner and along every edge there's a very obvious build-up of dust. The furniture everywhere is worn and scratched. It's a practical room and the beds are comfortable but other than that, I am not sure I can say much else. They have introduced a 'destination fee' - read resort fee which thankfully we did not have to pay since we booked and paid for our reservation before they introduced this. The lack of resort fee was one of the reason I was drawn to Hyatt Place and it was good of them to honour that.The breakfast as many on here have already said was pretty average. Crowded (and I'm not just talking about the people, the pigeons!) and the food is very much what you would expect from a 'free' breakfast. Fruit loops, sugary cereals, vanilla yogurt (nothing natural sugar free), the fresh fruit was the typical chopped up rock melon and pineapple. Some cooked stuff which I did not go near, some oatmeal which looked grey. Bread, some rice and condiments, pancakes. It was fine and certainly for 'free' it was ok but after 3 mornings, I could not face it again. If you are with kids like we were, it does save on costs but I would suggest perhaps if you are a couple, not choosing this place based on that. They do pretty good Acai bowls at Jamba Juice literally around the corner for under $10. The location is the winner here.

Slightly noisy from breakfast guests but this did not bother us as we where up anyway. We went out for food and came back. We where kept awake by teenagers running around the hotel corridors and in the rooms above. Slamming doors. We thought they would quieten down. I was wrong. We left it till 2am and called reception who sent security to investigate. This stopped for 15 mins and continued again. We had very little sleep which impacted on our honeymoon and the trips we had planned.We went to reception and spoke to jade. She was unaware what was causing the issue. Dispute us saying it sounds like teenagers. But we were offered a solution. 1) a smaller room in another tower without a view (away from the kids) but jade did not say why this was offered. 2) Move to the 19th floor again for a worse room without a view. We chose to risk staying in the room and with the lack of sleep we may just sleep when we hit the pillow. They started again in the Sunday night and I investigated. It was an oriental school trip. Our room was on the 6th floor and they had the 5th,6th,7th,8th and 9th floor. We went to book another trip and the guy started laughing as he knew also the culprit of the noise.I decided to deal with the problem myself as I was lied to by reception and security did not do anything either the night before.I spoke to two lads who I caught running around and told them I would be going to see their teacher and they can take me to them if it continues. I asked them to pass it on to their friends as we where on our honeymoon and we don’t mind fun but at 2am is stupid. To be fair the chat worked and stopped the noise at 00:30 hours. They left the next day. I was more annoyed that we where not told the truth and it could have been dealt with better. We paid a lot of money to Stay in the hotel and we could not be moved higher than the eight floor in the position we where as it is classed as ocean view. Very disappointed with how the problem was handled by Hyatt place staff. We should have been upgraded due to the lack of sleep and the upset Caused by the school children. Hyatt staff should have spoken to the teachers and had this been done we would not have the Sunday night fiasco. Did not eat dinner at the Hyatt. The breakfast was basic and not much choice. Pigeons flying into where the food is and this is not very hygienic. On the top where the food was. No staff chasing them out so they where free to roam. Children and customer chased them out of the restaurant.Due to the problem we had I have had to mark down the Hyatt Place. How the hotel was marked. 2.5 stars for the room. 0.5 star for breakfast. This would have been higher if it was not for the noise and the way the problem was dealt with. Why should we suffer due to unruly school children.","Carnforth, United Kingdom","Paul R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carnforth, United Kingdom</strong>",12,3.0

Interest in brekky waned after two days. Don’t get me wrong- food is nice! However food lacks variety! Public transport - truly convenient!!

Having stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Waikiki a few years ago, this Hyatt wasn’t as good. The room was nice and seemed recently refurbished, but a few things were not good. We arrived at 1pm to check in, we knew our room wouldn’t be ready until 3pm which was fine. We went exploring for a few hours on the promise of getting a call and email when the room was ready, none of this happened so we went back to the hotel at 3pm. They then said our room won’t be ready until 7pm! We were given another room to wait in whilst our was ready which was inconvenient. The next day we went for our breakfast and it was chaos! There is not enough seating, not enough food for a full hotel and the quality of food was terrible and cold, and the restaurant was dirty. We didn’t eat there again which was a waste given it was a ‘free breakfast’ and we had to go elsewhere for the week. I don’t enjoy standing up to eat either. Then we went for drinks in the bar and the bartender was ignorant and preferred to talk to one group of customers before serving anyone else, he was also the chef, so if someone orders food you can’t get a drink as nobody else steps in to serve. We also had a dog barking in the next room keeping us awake. Overall the hotel was ok and not far from the beach, but if you are looking for a relaxing/quiet time then this is not the place, it’s good for young families but I wouldn’t come back.

I give it one star because we did have a roof over our head and the housekeeping and food service staff works very hard! PROS:Two blocks from the beachTowels for beach/pool available dailyFree breakfast - average but hey, it's freeCONS:Valet - Be prepared to wait and do not expect ANYONE to help you with bags, etc. We had to empty our own car (quickly as others were waiting to get in) and put it to the side of the hotel. Had to wait over 30 minutes for our car to leave for the airport! They are way understaffed! Also, self-parking is a joke. Never a space available so you are forced to valet it every day during your trip. Room: VERY SMALL. Fold out couch is really a fold out chair and the mattress is a little smaller than a twin size. Also, they only have a couple of the bigger one bedrooms (as seen in the photos) so if you didn't get one and there are more than two of you in a room (we had 3) you will be tripping over yourselves and everything else. I asked the desk about changing to a larger room and if they had a two bedroom suite I could move us to. I was told all the rooms were the same size and there were no two bedroom suites. Imagine my surprise when I ventured down the hall to ask housekeeping for an extra towel and saw a two bedroom suite on one side and a much larger king room on the other! A/C: The A/C is set so that it can only be adjusted between 68-72. If you try to change it, it shuts off. A/C is a wall unit that will only come on when the sliding door is closed and the temp is over 72. Pool: Prepare to be disappointed. It's very small and there is NO hot tub. Front Desk: Check in time 3:00pm, several rooms were not ready. They have a ""Did you Forget it?"" stash of items and they were out of stock on several so I had to walk around Waikiki at 3am to find a 24 hour store to get Pepto-Bismol for my son. The desk clerk was no help with telling me where to go. I was talking to someone who worked there and was told that this hotel takes a lot of big groups and gives them special rates. Grad week was going on while we were there and it was a madhouse. They told me that is why rooms aren't ready by three for check-in (they all get late check-outs and housekeeping has to hustle to get them all cleaned as well as the other rooms). They also had to put breakfast downstairs to accommodate all the kids. We were there for over a week so we saw one group of grads go and another one arrive as well as another large tour group from Europe. The employee told me that the hotel does that to keep it at maximum capacity so if it pisses off us regular ""non-group"" clients we are but one room to their many. I understand they are a business but when you save all year for a vacation and choose to stay at hotel with a trusted name like HYATT, there is a level of service and accommodations that are expected when spending a lot of money on a room. Next time I'm just going to pony up the extra money for Embassy Suites which has never disappointed us. Live and learn! P.S. Our friends were staying in the rooms next to us.

Upon checking in, we were so very relieved to be given the opportunity to check in straight away. You have no idea what this did for us, to get a few hours sleep literally immediately made the world of difference! Especially with kids who were beyond exhausted. Location is a little out of the way from the 'heart' of the action so to get to the main area with all the eateries does involve a bit of a walk (families with young kids would appreciate this tip). It was ok for us but by day 5, our youngest (7yr old) was struggling with all the walking. Still considered centrally located but on the edge of the main area. Pool is very small and provides no shaded areas. Some beach umbrellas would be wonderful for the middle of the day swims. Pool towels were always readily available beside the pool.The thing we didn't enjoy was the hotel breakfast. Now we've stayed at many Hyatt Places and their breakfasts are all pretty well the same however, this one seemed 'worse' than the others. There was no fresh fruit, only chopped rockmelon/dewberry/pineapple mixed in a big bowl and everyone takes all the rockmelon so the bowl is just left with pineapples. We came down to breakfast at 9am one morning and there was no fruit left and when we asked about it they said they've run out. Its not hard to swap things around a bit...when visitors are staying 5+ days, the breakfast is almost not worth coming down for. We are on day 6 and we're all well and truly over it and considering heading out to McDonalds tomorrow morning. Beware the pigeons and birds...they are absolutely everywhere at the breakfast area (which is outdoors!!) It gets incredibly annoying for everyone. The birds fly onto your table and peck at your food. We're not able to eat in peace and forever shooing away the birds. Not sure why they don't enclose the breakfast area because you can see how annoying the birds become for everyone. The ladies tending the brekky area need to smile and simply be more pleasant and friendly. We are travelling with a family of 10 people and every morning we love to have a bit of hot chocolate. The hot chocolate sachets aren't readily available we have to request for it. So every morning we would ask for the 8-10 sachets and day 1 they were nice about it but yesterday we sensed a little attitude from the ladies. Then this morning topped it off, when my Husband asked for some hot chocolate the lady replied ""this is the 3rd day"" - handed him the box of remaining hot chocolate sachets and said ""here take this, its all we have left"". Gosh its not like we're asking for 10 packets for 1 person, we are a family of 10! Not sure how we'll go about asking for our hot chocolate again tomorrow morning! But the faces and they way they talk to each other (in a way you can tell they're clearly talking about us) is just rude and un-necessary. Umbrellas - well this got me a little frustrated also. For the 3rd day running we've gone up to reception at the beginning of the day (we have approached reception middle and evening also) and asked if there were any umbrellas available only to be told no there aren't any left. Are people just taking umbrellas and keeping it the whole stay and not returning them? One lady even suggested that it had been raining alot the past 3 days (we have not left Oahu and i can assure you it hasn't rained). So it would appear they just don't have enough to go around. Be careful about a 'destination fee'. We were told about it at check in but because we booked some time ago before the destination fee was introduced we didnt get charged. To me its almost like a resort fee which was one great thing about the Hyatt Place but doesn't seem like it anymore with the introduction of this fee (i believe its $15USD/day and covers things like beach chair etc). The lifts - OMG there's only 2 lifts and they are sloooooooow. Funnily enough, this has been the case with all the lifts at various Hyatt Places in the US. Do they all get their lifts from the same company? They're soooo painfully slow. Dont forget anything in the room because to get back up there will take you another 10mins just waiting for the lift. The hotel has a pamphlet of bits and pieces you can buy, borrow or get for free if you've left them home. In the brochure it notes you can borrow water wings and pool noodles for the pool. Our kids got so excited seeing this as they could do with the help of some floaties but when i approached reception i was advised these are no longer offered by the hotel. Its a cost friendly hotel and only one of a few that will take families with 2 adults 3 kids so yes i would stay again but i really hope all the Hyatt Places in the US would revamp their brekky menu - its not hard but it would just make everyones stay alot more pleasant.",Australia,"Rakimia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",48,3.0

The hotel is at the quieter eastern edge of the tourist district and you can wander that area or northeast towards a cluster of foodie hot spots (waiola shave ice, rainbow drive-in, leonard's bakery, ono seafood, side street inn, etc.) which range from 15-25 minutes away on foot. We found ourselves going back to that stretch of Kapahulu Ave many times for the laid back local vibe.KCC Farmer's Market and Diamond Head are do-able on foot as well, but the uphill stretch on Montsarrat may not be for everyone. We uber'ed up and walked down.The hotel itself was just as we expected based on their branding. ""Modern Essentials"" is how they market this sub-brand of Hyatt and why we chose this place. No stodgy flowery bedspreads or granny-style furniture here, just a spacious, clean, crisp and contemporary setting with all the basics for a family vacation.Check-in was quick and adjoining rooms had been arranged already. Breakfast was decent, lobby has lots of lounging space, and there's a smallish pool if you want that. But the ocean is only a couple blocks away, and the breakwater-protected portion is very close, for those who have kids.All in all, exactly what we wanted from the place. The only real negative was slow-ish elevators (not enough capacity at peak hours), but there were a couple of questionable observations I had that may be something or may be nothing.We found the housekeeping to be a bit too ""friendly"" (we didn't want housekeeping for the three day stay, but she made a point of engaging us in conversation both mornings about clean towels and emphasizing that she wouldn't be working the day we would be checking out, so it felt like she was fishing for an early tip...we did let her in on day two to do clean-up and left a tip).The other thing was that there was lack of clarity with their valet parking policy (we had a one day rental car parked overnight and no one told us to bring back the paper parking tag hung on the rear view mirror when we returned the car to the agency...apparently, if you don't tell them you're returning the car or bring back the tag, they assume you're still parking there...seemed like there was high potential for us to have a dispute upon check-out if we hadn't run into one of the staff who asked us about the tag...we managed to retrieve it from a small bag of garbage to give back to them).","Vancouver, Canada","spacemanspiff007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",54,4.0

The eating area for breakfast is outside in the same area as the pool; if you go during the morning rush (around 8/8:3) seating is rather crowded so you might have to stand and wait a few minutes for a table.

Breakfast is buffet on the pool deck outdoors on the 3rd floor which sounds good, but be advised that as you eat your breakfast the wind (or rain)is blowing at you, you may be need a sweater, and if you leave your table for some reason, the birds start picking at your breakfast.Rooms were not cheerful, somewhat outdated. Bed was comfortable. The lobby is uninspiring, with no music, just big brother CNN droning on the TV screens, like the airport. There is no sit down restaurant, just a bar (with no-one behind it) that supposedly takes food orders.

Having run away to Waikiki beach over a dozen times in the past 20 years the hotels in a good location off the main strip but still close -2 blocks from the beach providing for a little bit of a more relaxed off the strip experience. If you want a predictable hotel experience within two blocks from the beach it’s great and provides a lot of options to keep your trip low on cost and high on beach and relaxation. This hotel is towards the end of the strip so you’re closer to the park and Diamondhead if you like to go for morning hikes going up the road to Diamondhead is a real nice morning activity. You can always walk down the strip and have dinner at Ruth Chris if you like or another of the nice restaurants ,"Royal Oak, Michigan","Dave M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Royal Oak, Michigan</strong>",1,5.0

The hotel is in a good location. It is close to the beach and it is only a short walk to the main shopping and dining precinct. The room was fine. It had a nice big tv and a lanai to dry your swimmers after a hard day at the beach. The only thing I noticed was that the carpets weren't vacuumed daily (or if they were, they weren't vacuumed well) but overall the room was very nice. The room was a little noisy due to wind noise in the building coming up the elevator shafts and fire stairs and howling in the hallways, but it wasn't a huge issue. I had a car but used a public parking garage nearby for about half the price of the hotel's valet service. Parking is really at a premium anywhere in Waikiki so you can't blame the hotels for reflecting this in their parking rates. You just need to hunt around and see if you can find cheap self-parking. The hotel was $35 a night (I was there 8 nights) but I got a 7-day special over there road for $80 total. Yeah it's not valet parking but it's a good saving. The staff at the Hyatt were wonderful. They were all so friendly and had the aloha spirit. The breakfast was ok. Nothing spectacular. The food would've been better if kept in those stainless bowls with the lids on them that you see at some buffet breakfast place rather than on a hotplate in the open. The top of the potatoes and eggs cooled very quickly, but if you scooped from the bottom where it was warmer it was fine. The assortment of breads for toasting, spreads, juices, cereals, coffee etc was great. Overall, it was a great place to stay and I would definitely recommend it to others.","Sydney, Australia","Dainus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",77,5.0

The hotel rooms were clean. The staff in general were polite to us. The hotel in itself is average in looks compared to others like Alohilani, HYATT regency and Hilton but the price of rooms justifies it. The location is superb since it is just 2 minutes walk to the waikiki beach. We had ocean facing room but it is not the exact view we were expecting but it was ok. Check the photo. The breakfast was complimentary so it was a positive but choices are limited. They also provide a tray if you want to eat breakfast in our room. On a negative note the so called complimentary water bottles in the room are not free except for the first day. We were charged on the second day even though it was written complimentary on them. It seems it is free for HYATT members from second day but it is not written anywhere. The hotel provides beach towels which is again a positive. As a good gesture people do leave $2-3 tip for the cleaning staff everyday but it is not neccessary. Internet is free and speed is good. They have a small swimming pool and gym but we did not use them. Well we had beach in front of us so that swimming pool was insignificant. They have a bar in the lobby but it is not that great compared to the other hotels we visited. Hotel is next to the bus stop. Bus 22 goes to Hunuama bay and bus 2/19/8 goes to ward village, alamoana, TJMaxx and Walmart. Just make sure you have exact change to buy bus tickets as they do not give change back. It is strange that the buses do not accept card or do not have any touch-on card systems there. You can also get trolley service for $2 to alamoana shopping mall. Commute to airport is cheaper ($29 + tip) if you use the taxi service (charley's taxi) arrangement from the hotel. They will be happy to book it for you. Uber will cost you more.

In advance of arrival I had emailed the hotel several times - requesting a lower floor on 3rd or 4th floor as my son will not use elevators. This request was granted which we appreciated. We found 4th floor to be convenient for getting to breakfast on 3rd floor (quickly using stairs instead of elevator). Upon booking with Delta Vacations - they would only let us book a City View room. We really wanted a Mountain View room - I had emailed the hotel asking if we could upgrade to Mountain view on arrival (and pay the difference). I was told we could. On arrival we were NOT given the Mountain View we wanted, but a Ocean View (which I'm sure they thought was better) - being on 4th floor it was a SLIVER of ocean between 2 tall buildings and eye-level with the top of another building. It was not a great view. Plus the room was a 2 queen room but very small - nothing like the ""specialty 2 queen mountain view"" rooms look on-line. They look much more spacious on-line than what we got. I'm still not convinced we got a specialty room we paid for as our room was very cramped for 2 adults + 2 Teens. I did go back down to the desk to ask about all this and they assured me we were in the largest room they had. I seriously doubt that and ended up paying extra for a room we didn't want.All that being said - the hotel has several advantages:*no resort Fee *Free breakfast *2 blocks from beach *nice open air lobby *very close to Trolley & bus stops *ask at desk for beach towels *ABC store next door *on quieter Zoo end of Waikiki *Staff friendly *Rooms have Queen beds not DoublesA few disadvantages:While we appreciated the free breakfast, it does get a little repetitive after a week. The Lanai's are very small - barely enough to turn around on. Minimal counter space in bathroom. Minimal closet & drawer space - not enough room to put clothes anywhere for 4 people for a week.

The Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach didn’t let us down. The top reason we like this hotel chain is the free breakfast, hands down. With a family of 5, it is a value versus going out for breakfast every morning. The breakfast is great with fresh fruit (melons and pineapple), eggs, pancakes, you name it. To top it off, our room is clean, we have an amazing view of both the ocean and the mountains, the beds are comfortable, it’s close to shopping, convenient restaurants (Subway, Domino’s-right inside the hotel, etc.) and car rentals, two blocks from Waikiki Beach, and the staff have been super friendly.

I had a low floor, so I had no view, but maybe higher floors are nicer? Rooms were small and felt cramped. Was excited for free breakfast, but was disappointed - their hot food was cold, so I dealt with cold eggs, pancakes, and potatoes every morning (along with cereal, fruit, oatmeal, and options like that). Unfortunately, the breakfast area is outside by the pool, which meant the food got even colder. In the hotel’s favor was the wifi (had good signal and it was complimentary), and I thought the bed was comfortable which helped with jet lag. I didn’t particularly like the area where the hotel is - felt gritty and crowded and was pretty noisy in the morning with lots of buses coming through. Parking is expensive - $35 for valet parking and supposedly they only had two spots for self park at $25/night if I remember right. There is a garage across the street for $20/24 hours, but you have to be careful and make sure that you are current. I stayed out late one night and by the time I got back (27 hours after the last time I paid for 24 hours) and I was penalized $20 (nevermind that the garage offers 4 hours for $10). Was not happy about that.",,Someone6514,2,2.0

We chose this hotel because there was no resort fee, breakfast and wifi were included, and because of the proximity to the beach and zoo. Overall we were happy with our stay except that the wifi didn’t work in our room (it did work better at the breakfast area and in the lobby). We also found the hotel quite busy with groups.The room we had (Diamond Head tower) was quite small but was clean and the bed was comfortable. The mountain view was nice and we also had a partial view of Diamond Head. There is a lot of traffic on the street below (Kuhio) so although the balcony was nice, it wasn’t quiet.The breakfast was good, as others have stated and is one of the better free hotel breakfasts I’ve had. It has a basic selection of hotel and cold items, with the hot items changing each day. The breakfast can get busy at times with all the tour groups but we found the line would clear in 5 minutes and we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a table. The main breakfast area is outside although they do serve some food inside in the first floor lounge.The hotel’s “concierge” is actually paid by Expedia, so he makes money selling you tours. Not a problem for us, just something to be aware of. He was able to rent us a car for the day at Enterprise located at the Marriott next door for $20 less than it would have cost us to rent it on our own.The location of the hotel was good—very close to the part of the beach with a breakwall (safe swimming for children). It’s an enjoyable walk through Waikiki to the shops and restaurants. We enjoyed Marukame Udon on Kuhio, Flour and Barley at the International Marketplace (there is a free cultural show at the International Marketplace at 6:30 as well). Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel.","Ottawa, Canada","PT_Duck06</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",29,4.0

It's certainly a smaller hotel than the Marriott but that actually made the whole experience much more appealing. I was paying a reasonable rate for parking, no resort fees, a walk-in shower, and even the regular room rates are good. When we checked in, Lei, at the front desk was beyond helpful and kind. She was an excellent welcome to Hawaii. She took her time to explain what our options are and gave us helpful tips. She helped me trouble shoot an issue within a hour of my check-in and I was left with nothing but rest and relaxation for the remainder of my trip. Thanks to Lei!!!

The location is perfect - just a few blocks from the expensive downtown shopping district, a very short 2 minute walk to Waikiki Beach and many other locations. Most of the tours pick up right in front of the hotel. We only had a few days in Hawaii - they have an onsite Expedia Travel Assistant who facilitates activities for guests - Ben was great to work with and didn't steer us wrong. We had great tours. The Hyatt Place Waikiki offers a free hot breakfast everyday. SUPER deal and great options that change each day. Since food prices can be pricey in Hawaii, a free hot breakfast is great. Word of advice, get there early (opens at 6:30am) - as seating fills up quickly. There is always an option to get breakfast to go - they have trays in each hotel room for guests to take advantage of. The front desk staff were very hospitable and helpful. We used Charley's taxi for hotel/airport transportation as well as for areas around Waikiki. They were clean and not expensive. The rooms in this hotel are nice. Housekeeping (ours was Leonida) was very good - never had to wonder when the room would be cleaned. The bar and grab-and-go items can be pricey (except during happy hours) - we found the Starbucks across the street at the Marriott to be a better bargain. We didn't utilize the pool, but it is located in the same area as breakfast - not a big pool but adequate to cool you off on a hot day. We found this hotel to be perfect for us - affordable - great location - free hot breakfasts - great staff - clean - nice accommodations.

We really appreciated the great breakfast buffet that provided food that was healthy as well as the standard American fare. They even had miso soup, rice and kimchi! The exercise room was heavily used and provided a recumbent bike and treadmill as well as weights and exercise mats. The pool was kid-sized and right next to the breakfast patio. Not a discreet location for an early morning swim. We really loved dealing with the staff because they were extremely friendly and helpful. I had requested a mountain view room and was very glad I did. Our balcony looked out over the school ground near the zoo rather than directly toward a beach front hotel. We have one major complaint though. Even though the room was large the bathroom was incredibly small. There was one towel rail near the shower that could hold a single bath towel. The counter area was minuscule with no rails, just a couple of hooks (which the towels kept slipping off of) and a hand-towel ring. The toilet paper holder was open-ended so the roll of paper flew off every time I used it! There wasn’t a separate light for the shower/toilet room and the sink area so the light was shining into the bedroom every time we used the toilet.

We loved the location as it was out of the noisy, busy heart of Waikiki and we didn’t mind walking to shops and cafes. There are always people around and shops open nearby such as ABC store, making it feel safe for us to walk at night. The pink line trolley stops outside the Aston Waikiki which is just up the street from the Hyatt and that can take you into main streets of Waikiki, Ala Moana centre etc for $2US each which was very convenient. The actual hotel is very modern and clean, with the comfiest king size bed and sheets in the world! We had room 1405 on the top floor which had ocean views (obstructed), but still so nice to open the curtains in the morning and see the water and check out the weather! We would request this room again! It was quiet, clean and comfortable- everything you want on a holiday. Only thing I would change is the water pressure of the shower was a bit too soft. Hairdryer was provided and really good! The buffet breakfast was limited in choice and quite average so some days we decided to sleep in and miss it. Usually only a couple of choices such as eggs, bacon or pancakes with fruit and toast. But can’t really complain as it is free and included and better than nothing! Didn’t use the pool as it is in a shaded and very windy location, but the beach is only 2 streets away (couple of mins walk) and has the break wall so the water is flat like one big pool.

Well,we picked Hyatt because just like the Hilton it is known internationally and thought well you can't go wrong with them right? Wrong! We booked what was supposed to be 'ocean view' rooms which turned out to be only partial? We paid $315 aud a night per room, yes with free breakfast but seriously you can get a much better breakfast at McDonald's. Our bathroom light was somewhat dim and there was no water pressure. Everything was just old and dated even the ceilings in the whole building. Elevator was slow as anything. Staff were helpful and friendly though but overall experience was just disappointing.

Hyatt Place Waikiki met both criteria in spades and it is less than 2 minutes walk to the beach. Another unexpected surprise is that they refunded the daily resort fee which sealed the deal. The breakfast was all you can eat. There wasn't a huge variety of dishes to choose from; meat, eggs pancakes, cereal (hot and cold), fruit and hot and cold beverages everyday but it was both tasty and filling. I booked a room with one bed and a couch which was adequate for 2 people but the couch as it turned out was not great to sleep on. The room had a balcony which overlooked a part of Waikiki and the weather was convenient for hanging out on it. There was construction taking place nearby unfortunately which detracted from the balcony experience and the room walls were a little thin. I could hear a hair dryer from another room. They offered towels at the front desk which you could take to the beach free of charge and there was a daily expedia concierge to help with activity planning. The hotel does not have its own restaurant or tour bus drop off but both amenities are literally less than 100 walk from the front entrance. There is also a public transit stop nearby which can take you into the city or to diamond head.","Pickering, Canada","truemaster77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pickering, Canada</strong>",29,4.0

I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the hotel. My only concern was with a little gift shop in the lobby. The 4 of us went in one morning and spent over $200 between the 4 of us. My daughter purchased a pair of sterling silver earrings. When she went to put them on that evening one of the earrings broke. No big deal, we will go down in the morning and exchange them. You would have thought that would be ok, right? They were only $18 but it was the point she never even got to wear them because they broke. The lady in the shop was so happy to see us back thinking we were going to spend more money until we told her of the issue. Then her demeanor completely changed. She asked ""how do I know you got those here?"" Ummmmmm...because you just helped us less than 24 hours ago when we bought them? Anyways I left the broken earrings on the counter and walked out.

Previously I would have easily given the hotel four stars for a short stay, however the sticky dirty floors in a small room turned me off.The breakfasts are low quality for the most part, but work again for a short stay.

That said, I wouldn't stay in Waikiki for an extended period.One other down side for us was losing my youngest sleeping toy. It was handmade by a friend and I accidentally left it in the cot when we left very early in the morning for our flight.

You can walk to the beach in 2 minutes and there are towels at the pool that you can take to the beach, so no need to pack any. There is also an ABC convenience store and a Dominos Pizza very close by. - The breakfast buffet is good and is served every morning from 6:30 to 9:30. It varies a little each day and is a nice perk. - The staff is very friendly and helpful and booking excursions is easy and convenient. The Negatives:- The rooms look nothing like the online photos posted by the hotel; they are very small and dated. - The air conditioner does not go below 20 degrees Celsius, which is not enough to cool the room. There is no bathroom fan, so showering heats and steams everything. - We booked a king room with a sofa bed and did not get what was promised. When we inquired at the front desk, we were informed that the small armchair and ottoman in the corner of our room was the “sofa bed.” If you are booking this type of room as a family, there is not enough sleeping space for more than than two people.

There are two Hyatts in Honolulu. There is the main Hyatt that is ocean front. This one is about a mile away from the second). The one we stayed in was Hyatt Place which is an off shoot of Hyatt. This was 1 block away from the ""strip"" and the ocean. Despite it's location, it was actually perfect! As far as room location inside the hotel - We did pay extra for the ""ocean view."" If you stay in this particular hotel, I would advise against this. You literally see a sliver of the ocean and although beautiful, I would rather go visit or be in it instead. Most of your time is spent elsewhere, so the little you actually view this - save your money! Things to do and access - This hotel was immaculate and the included breakfast was a great way to start the days. This hotel is one of the main pick up locations for the tours so if you do any of the tours, there is no walking around and trying to find a pick up location! Staff were great, very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about ""local"" stuff to do. Concierge is a great thing to utilize... although most of the stuff we did we went through groupon! Just plug in the Honolulu location and there are great deals and are easy to redeem! (just be aware that some tours run on Oahu and on other islands. be sure to get the correct island tour local.) Definitely stray from the tours with NO pickup - Uber is great to use but an average cost is about $30 per ride. Rental Cars - you can rent a car affordably but overnight parking is a lot. We decided to plan tours most of the days and left one day, at the end of the vacation, open to rent a vehicle and travel on our own. This allowed us to re-visit areas and shops before leaving.Location of the Hyatt Place - No matter where we went in Waikiki for things to do, it was usually within a mile of our hotel - So if you don't mind walking, this is a great place to stay.","Wapwallopen, Pennsylvania","Michelle B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wapwallopen, Pennsylvania</strong>",24,5.0

Hotel clean, staff friendly, a block away from the beach and 10 min walk into city centre, breakfast good and they changed the menu each day.

Our family of four stayed in a room with one king and one fold out bed (the latter for two kids).It was like heaven! The room was spacious and comfortable with a mini-fridge. The location was prime within walking distance to Waikiki Beach and the Honolulu Zoo. The staff was very friendly, especially the valet staff who were always super efficient at getting our car and delivered it with a smile and a ""have a nice day"". The gym had adequate cardio machine choices and was well maintained.Perhaps the best part of the hotel was the free breakfast in the morning. On the third floor, the place bustled with activity and offered great seating options where you could eat while soaking up the Hawaiian sun. The choices were more than just a croissant and coffee - always had a main protein dish and waffles or pancakes along with a lot of fruit, oatmeal and other healthy choices.The only negatives are that our view from the 3rd floor was an older apartment complex and that the parking was $35/day (but it was in and out and on par with other hotels).Regardless, I highly recommend this jewel of a hotel particularly for families.",,Bcatgal,34,5.0

We are Hyatt world members. We are booked to stay here again on the 29th of December for 3 nights. This hotel is interesting in that at times it excels and at other times it’s a fizzer. Our check in experience was very good indeed. The thoughtful and kind Jade checked us in and was able to secure an early check in, much appreciated. Once in our room, a king size ocean view room on the 10th floor, the fizzer started. The room was tiny, the lanai was ridiculously small, to the point you can only have the chairs facing one another. The view should be described as ocean glimpses, there are buildings obstructing the view. Unfortunately the room was musty and damp. The bathroom was fine as were the minimal toiletries on offer. There was a good sized shower and commodious sink area. The rooms have a sizeable wardrobe but not enough hangers for two people. There is an iron and board a safe and bar fridge. As for coffee making this is tricky. They supply a one cup pod dripolator which splashed everywhere and is very messy when trying to extract a cup of boiling water for tea. A kettle here would be an improvement. The bed was one of the highlights, firmish and super comfy. I’m not sure how often housekeeping change the sheets but I will enquiry for our upcoming visit in a few weeks. The tv was very good as were the viewing options. There is a one seat fold out lounge in the corner which was rather nice to stretch out on using the ottoman provided. This hotel offers breakfast. Now this is a game of two halves... in that the breakfast offerings are really good and plentiful but the fact that breakfast time ceases at 930am PRECISELY weekdays and 1030am weekends is annoying. What it means is that unless you get there super early you need to fight the crowds and believe me it is really crowded. My advice to management is to open up the weekday breakfast hours to follow the weekend hours and leave it going until 1030am. That way you diffuse the rush and crowd somewhat. The staff do an excellent job of keeping the food and dining areas impeccably clean. There is a pool area but we didn’t use the pool. The hotel has a cute bar area and a happy hour where we enjoyed great cocktails by the affable and cheeky bartender Nick. He was very entertaining and knows how to work a crowd, a real pro. The hotels proximity to the beach and Waikiki attractions is a real winner it’s just so convenient to everything. So we will return in a couple of weeks and have booked a city view room, it will be interesting to make the room comparison on our next visit.

Also requested an early morning wake up call on day of check out that didn't happen and got a poor apology at reception and no reason why the call was never made.

We loved it because we had plenty of room, free breakfast, and the location was excellent! First thing you should know is that if you have a car, DO NOT park at Hyatt Place. It's crazy expensive. Park caddy-cornered across the street in the garage (in & out privileges for about $80 for the whole week!). This hotel is located a 3-minute walk to the beach, next door to an ABC Store, and within walking distance of tons of other shopping and dining. The hotel itself is very nice, but not fancy -- to be expected for a Hyatt Place. Our room was clean, well-appointed, and had a partial view of Diamond Head, but we didn't spend much time on the balcony. Breakfast was good! It was served outdoors on the 3rd floor for most of our stay (not much of a coffee view) and had a variety of food that was switched up a little each day. Among other things, they had bacon, sausage, eggs, rice, fruit, miso soup, breads, yogurt, cereal, coffee (but no flavored creamer -- bummer!), milk, and juice. It was great for a family to fill up before heading out, especially since food is so expensive in Hawaii. The last couple of days, they were resurfacing the breakfast area, so they served everyone on the 2nd floor and in the lobby. They struggled to keep up both areas. This should be an issue for future stays because I assume it's long been completed, but I would not have like it if this was going on during our entire stay. One other note... teeny tiny pool... like, don't even bother with it. But... you're in Hawaii, so go to the beach! Overall, GREAT hotel for a family!! Great for couples too, but be advised that it's not luxury. I would definitely stay here again!",KY,"joecaraboys</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>KY</strong>",52,4.0

We had sent a couple of requests directly to the hotel, and received a response back that was so canned it made us wonder if anyone had read our actual requests (still not sure as they weren't fulfilled, including a special occasion). We also had a strained check-in experience - not the staff's fault - the person ahead of us was pretty angry about their room. When it was our turn, we were advised that the view room we had booked was not available, but we were upgraded! Although the upgrade was to a larger room, we were allotted a ""city view"" (we were only told this after we specifically asked about the view), and staff said there were no view rooms available, so we had no choice but to accept the room.The included breakfast the next morning was literally a whirlwind. The outdoor breakfast space was really hectic, and it was super windy, so napkins and paper cups were flying around (along with a few birds) Food quality was decent, and to their credit, staff did a fantastic job keeping up with the crowd. Although they did change up 2 of the 3 hot items each day, I found the variety very limited, and they didn't change their side items at all (always the same fruit salad, same breads, etc. etc.) I just wish they had a larger selection, but I recognize with the volume of people and the physical space, the hotel was trying to maximize efficiency. Like many other reviewers, the elevator situation impacted us. Most times, they were fine, but at breakfast time, they could be super slow. One day, we waited over 10 minutes for an elevator. Many people decided to take the stairs, and we finally gave up and did as well (it took at least 5-7 minutes for another guest who HAD to wait for the elevator, to arrive!).Given the above, why did I rate the Hyatt so highly? A number of reasons:- No resort fees. Bravo!- Great location, a bit quieter than other parts of Waikiki, but closer to the beach and very close to bus stops where you can get to almost anywhere on the island (we had extra time on our departure day and took one public bus to the airport instead of a cab which took about 1 hour and cost $5 for 2 people).- Good value for the location.- Rooms/furniture were in good condition.- They had almond milk available at breakfast!- We met our housekeeper only once. Wilma was one of the most genuinely friendly people we encountered and was a great ambassador for the hotel.","Vancouver, BC","Twohoppers</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, BC</strong>",2,4.0

This was the most annoying part about this hotel, and is enough to deter me from staying here again. You need to plan an extra 10-15 min just for the elevator ride. Things are worst in the morning during the breakfast rush - I wanted to go down to get a cup of coffee in the morning to bring back to my room, I waited for the elevator to go down, got my coffee (after I line up), and waited for the elevator back up to my room - it was a 45 min trip!!! One evening we waited for an elevator at the lobby, just an average evening - 3 elevators have gone by before we were able to get in. We got back into our rooms 20 mins after we arrived at the lobby. Definitely my worst experience with elevators. And it wasn't even peek season...I cannot imagine how it would be when it's ""busy"" Breakfast: Breakfast is free, but was chaotic, borderline stressful. I had to fight for a table, then fight for a plates, eating utensils, coffee, food - you need to fight for everything single thing you need. Space was crowded and guests often trip over each other, it's a warzone, and not child friendly at all (think guest holding coffee running over toddler because he couldn't see the little one because it was way too crowded - whether not it's worth the stress is a personal choice, we skipped the breakfast after the first few days.

With 200 plus hotels in Waikiki and if you are not on Kalakaua Ave, you are not going to get an ocean view. Somehow, where my room was located on the 16th floor was and no tall hotels in front, i had a pretty nice view of the ocean albeit a bit set back. Liked to see the sailboats going by for sunset. Queen beds were comfy and room pretty much had everything needed: mini fridge, coffee maker and flat screen. The only thing I noticed was that the room ad some quirky corners. I think it's because it's an older refurbished hotel and it's just a bit odd to see some corners and some quarter walls in the rooms. I'm sure they serve a purpose but it's just quirky.

The location was perfect for us, far enough down the strip to avoid bachelor parties, college parties and other alcohol related shenanigans. (If you are looking for more of a party atmosphere look for hotels around Lewers Street.) Paoakalani Avenue is kind of at the end of Waikiki, but delivers you to the ""reefed"" swimming area, which is the ideal location for taking little ones into the water. I did hear other guests complain that the pool was small and didn't have a bar. (If that's your thing, look for another hotels.) Personally, I don't find I spend much time at the pool when there are such beautiful natural beaches so close. Staff were very friendly and very helpful, the rooms were great, and the morning breakfast was such a nice surprise. Plus there is the use of complimentary beach towels and daily water bottles. In the alley way, that's west of the Hyatt, zoo side, there is this little food cart that serves Honduras food. If they aren't open when you walk by snap a picture of their number and place an order when they are open, there can be long wait times; its great food at a cheap price (by comparison).I do have to say I love the Hyatt Brand. It's the first ""brand"" I committed to, they offer quality, clean accommodations from their less expensive to their most expensive and their staff (at all locations) go above and beyond to make my stay fabulous.

I did a decent amount of research prior to booking this trip, and I chose this hotel for three reasons: (1) I used my Hyatt rewards points (2) No resort fee (3) Free breakfast. For 12,000 points per night, this hotel was a great value (we were also upgraded to a larger room). I also saved about $30/day for not having to pay a resort fee. In addition, I probably saved an additional $30-40/day on breakfast. The breakfast food is way above average for any limited service hotel standards. That said, he opted not to eat there the last couple days of our vacation. I greatly appreciated the fact that they were able to get us in our room at 11am, which is several hours before normal check-in. That was very helpful because of our young child. The overall location is good, but the most prime location, in my opinion is few blocks further west because that's where most of the shopping and restaurant are located. I'm glad we didn't rent a car for the entire duration of the trip. We rented one on two different occasions and just picked it up in the morning and dropped it off that same day, which allowed us to use the car for day trips up to North Shore and we avoided having to pay the parking fees. I booked one car ahead of time through Hertz (Hyatt Regency Hotel) and another car at Enterprise (Marriott Hotel - directly across the street) while we were there. The ""Expedia Expert"" at the hotel lobby was very helpful in explaining the different things to do with our rental car.

We were charged $3.00 for a bottle of water in the room that we did not use. When we first got in the room we were happy at least they provide a free water till we read the note attached to the bottle. Unless we belong to certain credit card member, it would be $3.00 ,so of course we had been getting 1.5 liter bottle from ABC store a block away for $0.99 each. Just a suggestion, bottle water is very cheap, less than $.30 from Costco. Just put the first two bottles in frig with a note saying ""complement of the hotel"" It will be a refreshing welcome from your hotel after all the traveling. We got free water from lesser stars than your so I am sure you can afford to do that. It was nice of the gentleman who said ""as a courtesy"" took off the charges, but i am still mad because we did not use the water. Why did the housekeeping not record accurately? We only let them clean twice during our week stay, so it's not that we let them work extra hard to get even. I asked if the housekeeping turned in my 5"" magnifying mirror I forgot to get from the bathroom mirror, he said no one had turned it in.

The decor in the room and hallways was very dated, this my husband tells me is typical for a lot of American hotels, no neutral tones and the bathrooms could do with an upgrade. We booked to have breakfast included but I would advise against this. We were told the breakfast room was being upgraded and they had a temporary breakfast room on the 2nd floor. We only opted for this on the first morning as it was like a cafeteria and not a nice place to be first thing in a morning! We were told there was also an overflow area they set up breakfast in the foyer so we opted for that the rest of our stay, finding somewhere to sit though was a bit of a problem. The breakfast itself was the same cold offering each day. Fruit, yogurt and cereal were cold options and the the only variation to the warm option was bacon and sausage on alternate days and the same with waffles and pancakes.

Upon our arrival (after 12 pm), we were greeted by Anabelle (front desk receptionist) and gave us early check-in with a great big King size bed (extended space corner-room with separated living room (2nd TVs and large sofa bed), large balcony with the view of Manoa Valley, Diamond Head and partial Ocean view)) from our 10 floor in the Diamond Head building. The view was spectacular and the wind/breeze felt so relax. Anabelle even sent us a bottle of chill champagne and 2 glasses to our room as a gift of our 20th year Anniversary celebration. The Room is big with spacious space, with a mini-fridge and updated/modern furniture. The bed is very comfortable and the A/C system is super quiet and cold. The safe in the closet is also very big for storage. Our room had daily cleaning by Mildred and her crews who kept the room exceptionally clean and left us daily extra bath towels and 2 daily bottle waters. The provided free daily breakfast was excellent (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, rice, miso soup, kimchee, oatmeals, pancakes/waffles, toasts, cereals, yogurt, cottage cheese, fresh cut fruits, coffees/teas/juices). The service was also great provided by Sonia who helped clear/clean our table and gave us some insight information about local favorite attraction to do. On our last day, Anabelle had arranged for late check-out at 2pm since we don’t leave to HNL airport until 5:30pm. Anabelle also arranged a Hospitality room for us. Amanda provided us a Hospitality room at 4pm to freshen up prior to leaving to HNL airport. All the staffs (Anabelle, Mildred, Sonia, Amanda, and Ted) at the Hyatt Place are so nice and provided exceptionally services. Anabelle should be employee of the month/year. We love her kindness/help and most of all - her Ohana spirit. We will definitely recommend the Hyatt Place to friends/families and will stay here again in the future.

Great modern room with good aircon. The small balcony was wonderful to relax on for an early morning coffee before heading down to the full buffet breakfast (included in the rate). By far the best buffet breakfast we had at any hotel during our trip. A wonderful selection of cereals, cooked food, continental, fresh fruit, juices and coffee, also caters to the Asian market with rice and hot food. All staff so friendly and greet you whenever they pass you, always smiling! Big stand out is no resort fees and free buffet breakfast which is very welcome as Hawaii food is very expensive. Wonderful to get beach towels to use from the lobby. A very quick walk to the beach (was no problem for us with 3 kids and all the beach paraphernalia that comes with it). Straight across the street is the perfect family beach as there is a surf breaker which means no large waves on that part of the beach so super safe if you have kids. The main beach with good waves is just to the left and right if that's what you prefer!Location is just perfect and easy walking everywhere in Waikiki.

The Hyatt Credit Card after all, provides you with a category 4 or lower night annually. Being that this was a lower category than the other Hyatts here, I was a little concerned. But, I had nothing to worry about. As you can see from the photos I've posted, the property was in excellent condition. The rooms were clean, nicely appointed, and felt fresh and new. The room was amply sized with a desk, a sitting area, and a large king sized bed. There was a TV provided with a bevy ports for connecting your own devices. I initially arrived at the hotel at 2:45pm for check-in. There was a short line, and I was greeted by a very friendly staff. The member checking me in acknowledged my Discoverist status level and provided an upgraded room on the 15th floor with an ocean view. I was initially booked for a city view. Having a view of the Ocean was a nice touch for an 'off the strip' hotel. As I had mentioned earlier however, the walk to the beach is just a quick 5 minutes away. Parking is an issue most people have when coming to Waikiki. After some research here on Trip Advisor and some travel blogs, we discovered that the Waikiki Banyan (entrance on Kuhio Ave) offers $20/24hours of parking. If you do a Street View on Google you'll find the Waikiki Banyan Parking entrance easily on Kuhio Avenue between Paokalani and Ohua.The bed at the hotel was soft and very plush. I think for those of you that like soft beds, you'll love the bed. I prefer firmer beds, so the bed was a tad too soft for my liking. But, it was undoubtedly still quite comfortable. The air conditioner was also powerful and kept the room sufficiently cool. The complimentary breakfast buffet is a nice touch, and the hotel provides you with a tray in your room so that you can bring the food to eat in the comfort of your room. I partook of the scrambled eggs, bacon, waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt, and oatmeal. Well, my wife and I shared those things. We also drank the coffee and juice provided at the buffet. Overall this was a very good stay. My wife and I plan to stay at this hotel again when we run the half marathon in April of 2018.

Because I didn't want to change hotels, I picked one in Waikiki and accepted the 30-minute commute for my work days. The Hyatt Place was perfect. It was an interesting 5-minute walk to the beach. My balcony had a close-up view of Diamond Head, but also an ample peak at the ocean. My room was the LARGEST hotel room I've very had outside of a suite. It included a separate sitting area.and LOTS of open space. A delicious breakfast buffet was included. The food was fresh and well-prepared and appealed to several cultures with its varied offerings. The room also had a serving tray should you want to bring breakfast back from the hot buffet.Service was always with a smile and genuine ""aloha"" feel. The ""Galllery"" seemed to be the whole lobby area and allowed staff to help you at the desk,snack shop or bar, so there was rarely any waiting.A first-time experience for me was the concierege provided by Expedeia. He was knowledgeable and committed to making sure we had a great time. We booked three excursions--super tourist time for me, but EXCELLENT. Our selections did not disappoint: A great magic show, a sunset cruise--with appetiizer buffet that was ample and reduced cost from dinner cruise--and a luau. A footnote to the cruise was the two sailboats on the horizon that crossed in front of the sun just as it was dipping into the water. People captured stunning pictures.Perhaps the best part of the week was not needing a car. I am so glad I chose not to rent, Lyft was easily available, even at 5:30 a.m. when I went to work, (Uber's competitor and my personal favorite), and the excursions provided pick-up and drop-off buses.

I chose the Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach primarily for its free breakfast and no resort fee. I did not want a large resort-type hotel since we did not want to spend a lot of time in our room. The HPWB fit the bill perfectly! One block from the main strip with safe swimming at Kuhio Beach, lots of restaurants and shopping. We did a circle island tour, all-day Pearl Harbour tour, a sunset cruise, a luau, walked the length of Waikiki Beach, enjoyed beautiful sunsets every night. What struck us the most was how nice the people are at the HPWB. From cleaning staff to room attendants to the breakfast staff...so nice. A special shout out to two staff members... Angeline at the Reception desk who is a genuinely sweet girl and cares about her guests ...and Nicholas at the bar....we enjoyed our pre-dinner drinks and chats...you are a great guy!

We typically have stayed at more upscale hotels towards the Royal Hawaiian Center, but we knew we were going to need more space since we were bringing our baby (and what seemed like waaay more stuff). We both had concerns about not being right on the beach like we had in the past-but it's seriously like a 2 block walk to Kuhio Beach and so not a big deal. (Esp considering we had the little one--Kuhio was great for babies!) We had a speciality city view (2 queen) room. It was very spacious with room for a full size crib (rented from a third party. Hyatt place offers pack n plays). The mini fridge was great for milk and snacks. We had a bathtub too (which was important to us with the baby taking baths--the hotel told me not all rooms have bathtubs, which is why we picked the room we did. So if you're looking for that-I'd call them to verify before you book). The room was clean, and let me tell you--everyone was SO NICE. Yes, I know, usually everyone is nice but every single person we encountered was so sweet and helpful. (Valet, front desk, housekeeping, people that helped at breakfast, etc). Amanda (at the desk) even remembered our names - and I'm sure she encounters lots and lots of guests all the time. Free daily Breakfast was a plus. It wasn't anything that was super delicious, but it was quick, easy, and convenient, and definitely not bad! We typically do light breakfast and then save up for lunch/dinner--so this was perfect for us. (Eggs, potatoes, biscuits/gravy, etc rotated with the standard toasts, cereal, fruit, yogurt, rice and also miso soup). Only complaint would be location. It's located really close to Kapahulu and we felt like we were needing to walk at least 1/2 mile to go places we liked to usually go to. (Think more midway down kalakaua. But really, we ate enough a little walking wasn't going hurt us. Plus, you're walking around HAWAII.) so we would definitely stay here again with a child.

The front desk agent, Lei was the one who helped us check in and upgraded us to a ""half ocean/half city view."" However, the ocean view is blocked by surrounding buildings (I wouldn't recommend paying extra for an ocean view room as Hyatt Place is blocked by tall buildings). The room itself was very nice and clean. The room had a balcony, fridge, and a couch. The hotel also offered a complimentary breakfast buffet which was okay, nothing special. The breakfast buffet usually had your usual eggs, bacon, toast, cereal, etc. The hotel was a 5 minute walk from Waikiki strip, beach, and the zoo. There are many restaurants in the vicinity. Lastly, the hotel does NOT offer parking other than valet which is quite pricey - $32 a day with in & out privileges. The men who work at the valet are also very friendly. We recommend parking at the Banyan which is a 2 minute walk from Hyatt Place. They have a weekly rate for $80 or $20 for 24 hours. Overall we would recommend Hyatt Place if you aren't looking for anything luxurious as it was a very pleasant stay.",,Charlene C,2,4.0

The service at the hotel was fantastic at all times. From check in to room service and check out, I cannot commend the hotel enough on the professionalism of their staff.The rooms were clean and well maintained. We stayed in the specialty city view and were very happy with the size of them. One of our rooms did have a much better view than the other. The other actually didn't really have much of a view at all other than the pool.The hotel pool definitely looks a lot nicer in the photos. It is quite small and does need some major work to make it look more appealing to the guest, especially in Hawaii.The breakfast was very disappointing. It was almost the same thing everyday and not appealing at all. Pretty much what you would have at home when you are in a rush to head out to work or get the kids ready for school.

They have an outdoor pool on the 3rd floor (it's not very large), a 24 hr gym with weights and exercise machines, and coin operated washers and dryers for $3 each.

Booked our vacation package through Costco. Two key points why I booked our stay at the Hyatt Place. No resort fees and complimentary breakfast buffet offered everyday.ROOM - Arrived at noon and our room was available right away. Jade checked us in pretty quick and answered all of our questions. We stayed in a standard size room with a comfy king-bed on the ninth floor. Some extras included are a mini refrigerator, coffee maker, safe, and a love seat w/ottoman. The room is a bit on the smaller side, so next time, I will opt for a larger size room. There are two chairs and a small table provided on the balcony. We mainly used it for drying our wet swim gear after coming back from the beach. Not sure if the towels were brand new but they were very linty upon using them. We didn't see housekeeping on the second day there until the late afternoon around 5:30. I saw her in the hallway and since it was almost evening and we wanted to rest for a couple of hours before heading back out, I just asked for a couple of fresh towels and mentioned that she could just come back the next day while we were out.HOTEL GROUNDS - Pool is small, but you come to Hawaii to go to the beach and not the pool so that didn't bother us. There is a lounge/waiting area next to the check-in counter, dining area, an espresso/cocktail bar, business center w/computers, and two gift shops where you could purchase souvenirs. Free Wi-Fi for hotel guests. Complimentary breakfast provided every morning from 6:30 am to 9:30 am on the first and third floor levels of the hotel. It is buffet style. I noticed some of the food items were different each day so that was nice having a variety of options. We really enjoyed this perk before starting our day on a full stomach. LOCATION - We loved that the hotel was only two blocks away from Waikiki Beach and pretty much walking distance to shopping, restaurants and of course ABC stores! The ABC store is on the next block so on the first day we arrived, I went and bought snacks, bottled water and other necessities that we needed for our stay. We booked a couple of tours so we were either picked up curbside in front of our hotel or across the street at the Marriott. The hotel is also located along a bus route if you choose that mode of transportation. We didn't rent a car so we didn't use valet, but I noticed it was $18/day to park. We used Uber and Lyft a lot as well. It's also located on the last block on the strip right before the Honolulu Zoo so it's not as hectic as far as crowds so that was nice.Overall, we had an amazing trip! Hotel staff was great and helpful. If you head down to the beach, you can ask the front desk for towels to borrow if you don't have any of your own. Like I said, the daily complimentary breakfast and no resort fees are a big plus if you're on a budget and want to stay in a nice and clean hotel.","Lacey, Washington","Poker_Ninja_206</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lacey, Washington</strong>",24,4.0

Breakfast was included in our stay and was always good with variety. Serving time was perfect. Café near front desk had great staff and wonderful food as well. The only concern I would mention is the noise level. while the noise was not in excess to keep us from sleep or hindering relaxation, it was louder than other hotels we have stayed at. There was a group of younger people staying next to us for a portion of out stay that were really enjoying themselves resulting in the noise. We were next to the pool a few floors up and could also hear the noise from there, which is expected. Please note this noise level was not to a complain level but only negative I can note about this place.They have an Expedia Expert on site that was amazing! Anything we needed he helped with.

As we arrived into Honolulu early morning, we were unable to check into our room until 3pm. However, by 2pm we thought we'd check to see if by chance it was available. Not only was there a room available, but we were upgraded into one of the larger rooms in the hotel. The room was immaculately clean and spacious and the bed was comfortable. One of the reasons for staying in at Hyatt Place was that breakfast was included. I have to say, this is one of the best hotel breakfast offerings I've experienced to date. The buffet style breakfast is served next to the pool area and has a wide variety of hot and cold foods. I liked that there was a choice of healthy options to choose from which is sometimes overlooked by some establishments. Hot item choices looked to be rotated on a 3 day cycle.The swimming pool area was perhaps a little small given the size of the hotel however we didn't have any problems getting sun loungers. We found that in order to grab those extra few hours of sun in the late afternoon, we had to physically move the sun loungers to the far side of the pool as the light is blocked by the hotel building. I also had the chance to use the gym facilities which were also impressive with a larger than expected room to cater for possibly up to 5 people.The hotel is situated slightly outside of central Waikiki however is only a few minutes walk to the beach and about 15 minutes to the central hub of restaurants and bars. Overall we couldn't be more impressed with this hotel and would definitely stay again if we return.","Orewa, New Zealand","KiwiTraveller85</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orewa, New Zealand</strong>",58,5.0

A wide selection including cereal, fruit, porridge, yoghurt, breads, juices, milk and even almond milk, various teas and coffee. The hot food is rotated each day but normally included some form of eggs, meat, and potatoes. Staff do a great job of keeping the dishes cleared away and the buffet stocked. The buffet is served inside with seating around the pool area. Some reviewers mentioned the birds being an issue. There were quite a few little sparrows around but no big messy pigeons. They didn't really bother us, they stay away unless you leave your food unattended and then they will swoop in and help themselves! You can also take your food to your room.

The room itself is so very spacious but the bathroom with toilet and shower/tub was tiny. The fridge is very cold - drinks put in door formed slush with the dial set to max.

Didn't use the pool or exercise room - both small size. Laundry facility only offers 3 washers and 3 dryers at $3 per use each. Detergent is sold from a vending machine. I've learned to bring my own on travel. Go early or late in the day as it's always busy. I went to put my wash in dryer, arriving 5 minutes after the cycle ended and there was a foreign woman complaining to a hotel staff member and wanted to take my wet clothes out onto the table so she could have the machine. Really?! The Honolulu Zoo is nearby as well as the Aquarium within walking distance of 15-20 minutes respectively. Walking in the area is picturesque with the flowering trees and Banyan type trees. Many photo ops along the beach walk and pier. The tour desk is run by a representative from Expedia who is very friendly and helpful. Most of the tour buses pick up/drop off at the Marriott directly across the street. The drivers are chock full of information - too much to remember. Always a good ride.

We fly in/out of Pittsburgh airport frequently and stay at Hyatt Regency Pitt airport. We booked this Hyatt Place using Hyatt points and selected the hotel due to its close proximity to where the Ukulele Festival was held. Initially, I was uncertain about the hotel not being beach front and debated between points covering a room at Hyatt Place compared to using the points and paying the difference to stay at Hyatt Regency Waikiki. There were no doubts about choosing Hyatt Place after checking in. The hotel is a 2 minute or less walk to the beach, only the Aston Waikiki Beach is in front of the Hyatt, and there is ocean view from top floors. If we choose Hyatt Regency, you do have to walk across the street to the beach, so there isn't that much of a difference. Unless someone has difficulty walking, will most likely walk along Kalakaua Ave. that location on Kalakaua Ave. won't matter either. Upon arrival, as every hotel does at check-in, staff asked for my ID and credit card. After looking at my drivers license, the staff were prompt to acknowledge it was my birthday and arranged to have champagne sent to the room to further acknowledge my birthday. This gesture was such a surprise and later I noticed it was not only the check-in staff but all the staff was friendly and focused on guests having a pleasant stay. I agree with previous reviews that the rooms are small, but we previously stayed at Outrigger Waikiki and rooms were small size there too. At Hyatt Place, the rooms are modern, clean, breakfast is included, valet service prompt, and there is convenience of having an ABC store next door. Previous reviews have noted the $32 parking charge. The cost to park in the garages is high too, as it's cost associated with visiting Waikiki and there isn't the in and out and valet privileges as the hotel offers. Our only suggestion for improvement is offering more hot items at breakfast. If uncertain as I was between Hyatt Place and Hyatt Regency, I can confirm there will not be disappointment in choosing Hyatt Place.","Columbus, Ohio","Mjzeta</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>",135,5.0

I've stayed at same rating hotels and even better rating hotels but I think this is probably the best one I've stayed at so far. First of all they don't charge a resort fee, which really adds up. And those of you who complain there are no free parking around....then YOU probably haven't really looked. Look around the zoo area....look closely! We always try to stay around this area because there is free parking. Many hotels in waikiki are pretty dated. Even the better rating hotels aren't really that nice either. Our room was clean. I really liked how our bed was made that the sheets don't separate for our entire stay! The cleaning lady was always outside in the hallway at 7am in the morning and I'd always ask her for stuff if I needed it (I don't like calling down to front desk to request for things) and she was always so nice about it. I like how all the hotel staffs were very sweet and greeted us all the time. Breakfast is served daily at 6:30-9:30am in the lobby and on the 3rd Floor (pool area). They served the same food but the 3rd floor has a bit more selection (rice, miso soup and pickled veg). The pool is small, but since it doesn't get too crowded, it's good enough. We had friends who stayed at the Hyatt for two nights and then moved to the Sheraton for the rest of the trip and they missed the Hyatt because they thought it was better. One thing I didn't like was how there wasn't a light switch for the bathroom. I'd have to turn on the light from the vanity area which was outside of the bathroom. There's also no AC in the bathroom.

They have a variety of food options available and change it up daily. The location of Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach is very convenient with The Bus stopping right on the corner. We did not need to rent a car because of this, and saved a lot of money using The Bus and Trolley. It costs $2.50 to ride The Bus, and only $2.00 to ride the Trolley. The Pink Trolley right up the street takes you to local dining and shopping centers. It is only a short walk to the beach and there is an ABC Store right up the street as well. You will find many ABC Stores in Waikiki, and they sell basic necessities, meals, souvenirs, etc.If you plan to do any excursions/ tours, like going to the Polynesian Cultural Center or Swimming with Dolphins (etc.), most companies will pick you up in the morning right across the street in front of the Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach at the Marriott Waikiki Beach Hotel.

The customer is told to call hotel directly and that the offer is ""based on availability"". Anyone seeing this would understand it as meaning if a room is available then free parking is available to the target audience.When I first called, the hotel the rep stated there was no such offer. So I explained that is was on the Tripadvisor site and that reservations were to be make thru the Hotel.The Hotel rep then responded that no reservations were available in March. I hung up, easily found a date in March 2018, and called back.This time the hotel (same person I talked to before) said that the offer did not cover March.

Valet parking prices are on par with other valet services in Waikiki, but the valets themselves are very courteous and make it worth the cost of parking your car there.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Syake74</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",0,4.0

Open lobby is unique (not sure if all Hawaii hotels are like that). You can enjoy the nice weather while sitting in the lobby waiting for a ride, or room, or just chilling.Price: it's Hawaii, prices are gonna be high. Even then, I felt Hyatt Place had very fair prices for what we were looking for (two beds, one pull out bed). No complaints here!Location: felt central to a lot of areas, definitely on the south part of Waikiki though. Still walking distance to plenty of places. Think we walked along the beach up to Fort DeRussy Beach Park and back. Not too bad at all. Uber drivers could find the location, same with friends picking us up.Check-in: quick check-in. Could not accommodate early check-in, but it was during the holidays and...well, it's Hawaii. No points off there for that.Room: elevators are SLOW. We were kind of high, probably the upper 3/4 of the building. Not the very top, but not in the middle either where it'd be easy to climb stairs. We had a nice view of Diamond Head. Balcony with glass sliding door was the only natural light into the room. It wasn't dark, but we had light coming in from one side of the room. Standard hotel bed, sheets, and pillow. Pull out bed was exactly what we needed, so it was very convenient finding a hotel in Hawaii with two beds and a pull out bed.So here's the thing with the room. We were high up. Hawaii has winds. Dunno what it was about the floor plan, but there was definitely a wind howl in our room that high up. After investigating, we realized it was coming from the bottom of the door - the crack between the door and the floor. I called the front desk and they sent someone up. The solution was to place towels along the bottom of the door and block up that crack. It worked.The wind howl was noticeable. Probably would not have been able to sleep with it. When we came in each time, we quickly put the towel back in place. Not a fancy solution, but it worked. But I also expected a bit more.Amenities: wifi throughout, no complaints. The gym was adequate enough with some free weights, ellipticals, treadmills, and bikes. There were towels, water, and a restroom in the gym. The pool was very tiny. Didn't bother swimming in the tiny pool when the beach was close by. Buffet breakfast was nice each morning. We took some snacks with us as we left for our daily activities - helps when you don't have immediate access to a restaurant for lunch. It can get packed, so sometimes we saw people just bringing food up to their rooms, which appears to be acceptable since no one stopped them.Check-out: quick and easy check-out. No charges, no hassle. We left our luggage with the hotel since our flight was at night, no issues there either. I thought I forgot something in my room and they helped me get back up into the room and look for my item. Couldn't find it, housekeeping was looking too. Turns out it was in a pocket in my backpack...oops! But housekeeping and front office was very accommodating.Overall, I enjoyed the stay here! Would I instantly rebook here? Can't say that the hotel won me over THAT much, especially when a place like Hawaii is so competitive with so many hotels. But for a family needing two beds and a pull out bed, Hyatt Place was the place for us. I'm going to still shop around, but I'm going to keep this hotel in mind.","Orange County, California","PolarBearTravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County, California</strong>",13,4.0

It is a quick and easy walk to the beach, and just across the street there is an ABC store which has souvenirs, beach toys and food/beverages. We only stayed for two nights, as we had plans to stay at a different hotel in another part of the island. Other than the location, the highlight of this hotel was the BREAKFAST. As you know, breakfast can easily run you $40-60 for five people, so we were able to save money (and use it towards other fun things) and enjoy a FULL breakfast, including eggs, bacon/sausage, pancakes/waffles, toast, fruit, cereal and miso soup, plus all kinds of juices and coffee/tea! They serve the breakfast buffet near the pool, and the set up is very clean and comfortable. The staff is also very friendly and quick to clear your dirty plates. They served breakfast from 6:30am to 10am, so we woke up early for breakfast and then went back for a snack after swimming at the beach. The hotel lobby is nice and crisp, and the staff greeted us promptly to check us in. Because the lobby was so open, I liked that fact that you needed a room key to operate the elevators for extra security. Speaking of the elevators, there was quite a bit of a wait especially at breakfast and check-out time. There were only two elevators servicing 20 floors of rooms. Our room was on the 19th floor and had two queen beds. It was snug for the five of us but I did like that the sink was outside the bathroom so we weren't always fighting for bathroom time. It also had a nice partial view of Waikiki beach and a partial view of the rolling hills behind. It was also very clean and surprisingly quiet, even though we were close to the elevators. The pool was a bit disappointing. It is located on the 3rd floor, so it is shadowed by the surrounding hotels. It also looks outdated and it was small in size; when we went down there were about 4-5 adults and 6-7 kids and felt super crowded; bumping into each other as you tried to swim or splash around. Luckily, the beach was so close, we spent more time swimming there instead of the pool. I would recommend this hotel if you want to be close to the beach. They offer clean and comfortable rooms, and a hearty breakfast. But, don't plan on spending a lot of time at the pool.","New York City, New York","Dee K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",28,4.0

Hyatt Place was the perfect choice! It's great for those who like me are resigned to staying in tourist-filled Waikiki when visiting the island but would prefer something a bit away from the madness. There is no resort fee and valet parking is available for a reasonable price. Breakfast is included in the cost and has both hot and cold options and plenty of coffee! There's a smallish pool near the breakfast area as well as a gym which admittedly I didn't use but offered the standard cardio machines and weights. The room itself was lovely and was big enough to feel that there was a bed/sleeping area as well as a comfortable living space with a couch and desk and chair. I also really like that the toilet/shower and sink area is separated by a door and I imagine that it's more convenient if you are staying with someone. Being a Hyatt rewards discoverist member my room was upgraded and I also received a free bottle of water daily. This all being said, it's the service at this Hyatt as well as all the other Hyatts that I have stayed at that keep me coming back. From a lovely welcome note in my room from the general manager to the folks at check-in to the car valets everyone was so warm and welcoming!

This should be considered a partial ocean view room (there were options for this selection). This room was smaller than it appeared in pictures when I booked and also the view was a little ocean and a lot of buildings. It would have been nice to have had a more truer idea of what we were getting ourselves into because, we were there for our honeymoon. That is the one time you want things to be as perfect as possible. I spoke with someone at the front desk about my concerns and she nicely switched us to another room but, it couldn't be done until the next day. Which we were okay with as long as we got a better view. We were switched to room 1205 and this one did have a better view but, still not a full ocean view room. We were advised that since this hotel was just off the ocean front, they don't have full ocean view rooms but, this wouldn't be something you knew unless you were local or unless they told you in their descriptions. I recommend you replace 'ocean view' in your titles with 'partial ocean view', so that people get what is marketed. The hotel itself is very nice however, the rooftop/pool/breakfast area (floor 3) was lacking. On our first night there we went up to the pool to check it out and the deck area was a disaster. The furniture was all out of place and cushions were off. It was dirty and was not at all like the pictures. Since they have breakfast up there, my assumption is after breakfast things just don't get cleaned up or put back together as far as the patio furniture. The breakfast was good, it is a nice selection. The staff was excellent. All were very polite and tried their best to accommodate us with what they have. We ordered food from the hotel one night and it was okay. Maybe just a little pricey. I think a flat bread was around $12 and it was not very big and seemed as if it was cooked from a box. We were unaware that valet parking was the only option for parking and that it was $32 a day. That seems a bit extreme. Especially since a few times we would wait around 10 minutes to get our car because, there would only be 1 or 2 people working valet and a lot of people down there to pick up or drop off their cars. For the times the valet was not busy, it worked fine and was quick and easy. On our last day there, we planned to sleep in a little because, we had late night flights that night. We were woken up by the fire alarm going off. We made it down 12 flights of stairs to find out it was a false alarm. Don't get me wrong, we are better safe than sorry but, no one apologized. They just said it was a false alarm and that everyone could go back to what they were doing. People started piling onto elevators and just before we were to get on one, an elevator got stuck and was stuck with people in it for quite a while. So in fear of getting stuck in an elevator we walked up to the third floor to eat breakfast, where there were tons of people due to everyone being woken up. We had to wait in a long line for food and even utensils. It was just a cruddy way to end our stay. Overall we did have a great time in Hawaii on our honeymoon but, there were definitely things the hotel could have done differently to make our stay what we anticipated it to be.","Urbandale, Iowa","Ashli N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Urbandale, Iowa</strong>",2,3.0

The room was large and comfortable with a couch and a really nice TV and balcony, a great place to rest when dealing with jet lag coming from the east coast! The room was quiet and the bed was comfortable. Front desk staff were great, I was given a lot of good advice as well as a steady supply of beach towels! Valet staff was wonderful too, service was quick and efficient. Breakfast was delicious, great variety and I liked that there was a tray in the room to bring breakfast up to your room if you preferred.

I stayed here on a business trip for 11 nights. When I arrived the staff was very friendly. Millie greeted me in a way that made me felt welcomed. I had made 4 separate reservations at the hotel and to avoid having to check out / in I asked if it could be made into 1 sole reservation. It was explained to me that the way the reservations were booked, that it could not. However, that I would be kept in the same room (in which I was upgraded to a larger room, even though I have no status at the hotel, which was a nice bonus: Room 318) and that the day before / day of the new reservation that I would have to get my key redone (not a big deal stopping by the front desk). My room had a king size bed with about 3-5 feet of room on either side of the bed. It also had it's own ""living room"" of sorts that had a couch and additional TV. I did not use this room, as there was a TV on the dresser about 8 feet away from the foot of the bed. The bathroom and sink area was very spacious. The only negative thing I have about the bathroom, is the old shower head. The residue from the water usage was very visible, which also caused the water stream to go in a few different directions. I would encourage the hotel to update the shower head that has better flow. The hotel is situated about 2.5 blocks away from Waikiki beach. It is located on the opposite end of Waikiki from the Hilton Hawaiian Village, and takes about 10 minutes walking to get to the International Market Place. However, it is only 2 blocks away from the Honolulu Zoo in the opposite direction. Needless to say it is situated a little further away from most of the popular shops and restaurants, but nothing a short walk cannot fix. Upon returning from work, the hotel staff was very friendly and made for good conversation. I would like to identify specific staff (in no particular order): Heidi, Lei, Millie (as mentioned before), Angeline, and lastly the bartender Ikakia. Ikakia is the main bartender and made for excellent conversation for after work drinks or after dinner. When Ikakia was on break or not available, Heidi, Angeline and Millie served as backup ""bartenders"". They also made for pleasant conversation and were always very friendly. I only interacted with Lei a few times, however, she was always friendly and cheery as well. I only have 2 complaints of the hotel. The first is that of the pool. It is very small, maybe 10 feet wide by 20 feet long. If there is more than 5 people in the pool, it may seem very crowded. My other complaint is the valet service. It is run by another company (Elite Parking). There seemed to be a disconnect when dialing the front desk to ask for my car ahead of time when I needed my vehicle. The first 2 days, even though I called down, the valet either did not know I asked for my car or did not have it ready (when calling 15-20 minutes in advance). However, after I found out about the text service (408-724-9288), if I texted that number the night before with what time I wanted my vehicle, it was always there. I do think there needs to be some improvement to the valet service though, for those that do not know about this option. The text service also works for anything that a guest may need (laundry bags, towels, etc). It goes to the computer at the front desk and will continue to flash until someone acknowledges it. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach.",,James M,0,4.0

We also went night swimming after the concert on Friday night at Waikiki Beach which is also walking distance! Our room was spacious, enough to fit 6 of us- girls! Valet was great too, those guys were always quick and never complained about us coming and going throughout the weekend. And we probably had them fetch our car about 6(ish) times in the 2 days we were there haha! We remember Mark and Christopher always serving us with a smile. Unlike other (picky-eater) people that reviewed the FREE breakfast, we on the other hand LOVED IT! It kept us full til lunchtime and it was Ono! So many varieties. Eggs and bacon or sausages, had rice too, pancakes or waffles, cereal, fruit, bagels, toasts, oatmeal, they had SOUP even! We loved it, its better than spending more money somewhere else. We all felt that we saved money because of the free brekky the other bad review I read below, they were at the hotel the same weekend as us! And they didn't like the breakfast? well- maybe it's cos they are too high maintenance to begin with but if your country girls like us or in a big group- u will absolutely love the ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT FREE breakfast! don't listen to the other reviews when they say you will save by going to a hostel and eating out- r u frekkin kidding me? LOL. How u going be high maintenance eaters and stay at a hostel. LOL and the price to just eat McDonald's can be expensive too- it's Hawaii- the prices are high! One way to save money is to NOT BE A PICKY EATER LOL. But the food was delicious so I don't know what they were talking about We also wanted to thank an employee for their hospitality and Aloha he showed us while staying at the Hyatt Place Waikiki.

We book Hyatt thinking of a good breakfast deal. HoneStly?You Are Better off in a hostel if you want to save money...I stayed In an upgraded large room, which wasn't bad. But the Free breakfast is such a let down that you rather have booked a hostel, travelodge or a holiday inn or paid for breakfast elsewhere. So my breakfast for three days Ended up being 5 boiled eggs, porridge and coffee. That's all I could eat, I was still happy though, my husband wasn't as he's a fussy eater , he had only Rice Krispies for the three days and toast. We didn't save on lunch as other places you stay where you have a good breakfast that keeps you going for hours. This wasn't the case for my husband and my son. I got told off for not taking my plates from the table. Wow...Like a McDonald ( which is better in my opinion) felt like I was back in school. No tipping I suppose ?Appalling !

I used the points I earned staying at the Hyatt andaz on Maui to pay for our 3 night stay. we were given a king partial ocean view on the 10th floor. the hotel and room was clean and fairly modern. a Hyatt place is generally a hotel someone on business would stay at so don't expect pools and spas etc. but this Hyatt place was better than some Hyatt places I've stayed. since we were here in the middle of May the hotel wasn't very busy (slow season)  we slept in every day except one and did the free breakfast, went down at 8ish and easily got a seat. the buffet is better than average for a free breakfast ( pancakes,sausage,bacon,waffle, French toast, ham, couple Asian choices, donuts, cereals, breads, muffins, oatmeal, orange juice, apple juice, milks, water, red juice, etc). the pool deck is where breakfast is served with many tables etc but if there is rain or it's very busy the hotel gives you trays so you can load up and enjoy breakfast in your room or your rooms balcony. I did not visit the gym at the hotel but heard it's nice. the hotel is only minutes walk from Waikiki Beach and the zoo.  during the day we explored Oahu and went to pearl harbor and explored and did activities. we even went to a indoor fun park called tikis I think, that was next to a movie theatre so we saw guardians of the Galaxy 2. the movie theatre validated parking so free parking. we also went to Kuala reserve where Jurassic Park was filmed and rode ATVs, went to a macadamia nut farm, chiefs luau, etc. imention this because all this was within 30-45 minutes by car. we didn't leave the hotel till 11a each day and didn't come back till 1am or later. we did utilize room service for some snacks and early meal a couple times. (I highly recommend one of their chocolate chip cookies and ask for it to be warned up....sooo good)!  my only negative was when we left each day sometimes it took awhile for the car to be brought around and I think this was because they only had 2/3 valets working.  next door to the hotel is dks steak house. make reservations and go hungry. they have dry aged steaks and sunset view dining of Waikiki Beach. either indoor or outdoor on patio deck. I recommend the chocolate bomb dessert. the hotel also has self service laundry but we didn't use that. the hotels bar is pretty good but there's plenty of hopping bars close by if that's your thing. anywhere you go if they have a drink called a lava flow you gotta try it.

Had a kind bartender (Nick?) that chatted up my husband and me one night.Cons- Location: No view because you are a block from the strip.- Free breakfast: It is a madhouse because it is free...

The hotel is not on the beach; it is across the street from the beach. The beach is very narrow, so there wouldn't be room for the property. It was a very short walk. The location was great. Walking distance to pretty much anything on the main strip. The pool was way too small. By 10am, there were enough people in it to make you not want to go in. By 2pm, the pool was overflowing with children and adults to the point where water was splashing out constantly. The pool bar was outdated. We didn't even bother to stop for a cocktail.

I needed a room for one night, my last, and for that purpose it was fine. The room was clean, comfortable and well-appointed. But the hotel is not well situated, being several blocks from the beach. It's also located at a busy intersection with lots of street noise. I requested a quiet room after reading reviews here, which was granted. The view from the room was of other dingy buildings, with a peek at the water in the distance. Hyatt Place appears to cater to large groups looking for cost-effective accommodations. When I arrived at the free breakfast at 7:00am, it was already packed...and I mean PACKED. I've never witnessed anything like this crowd, at that hour! People were already situated around the pool, the food lines snaked through the length of the room, and there was nowhere to sit. Fortunately, I brought a tray from my room, and hot-tailed it back up there once I got my food. Way too much stimulation for that hour! Though the staff was hospitable, I wouldn't use this hotel for more than a pit stop.

We stayed in each of the 'towers'. On our first stay the room was a bit older but still pretty clean and tidy with good beds and a small balcony that you could sit on (with no impressive view). On our second stay we were in different section (different set of lifts) and the rooms were bigger and seemed more recently renovated. Having said that the air con seemed noisier and there was more street noise. Breakfast was rather ordinary and one morning it was raining which meant there was no where dry to sit and eat. We were presented with the option of going back to our room to collect a tray and then come and get some food to take back or to try eating in the lobby, which is what we did. The servers couldn't keep up with restocking plates and cups and the variety/selection for the breakfast was very sparse. Disappointing for a hotel of this calibre.Service was always provided with a smile. They also responded to an email that I sent following our final check out. Unfortunately, unlike most hotels,they do not provide free bottled water. Instead they have bottles in the room with a big label saying 'drink me' and in fine print a price of $3. For people with poor vision in dim rooms the price was not clearly readable.

The room layout was a bit odd but besides that beds were very comfortable and everything worked well. Exactly as we had expected from the pictures online which is always nice. Food - We ate the complementary breakfast every morning. It was one of the best free breakfasts at a hotel I had. Not the highest standard to beat but definitely a great money saver and they had a very large selection so you should be able to find something you like. Coffee was Seattles best, fruit was always fresh, they always had either pancakes or waffles (the waffles were really good), and usually sausages, as well as a breakfast open faced sandwich. They did also have a asian breakfast set out every morning. I did not eat it but my wife did and she said it was really good. For those who want just simple the had toast, bagels and cereal as well. Staff - This is where they excelled well past any other hotel experience that we have had. I don't usually write reviews mostly because I am happy enough with everything. The sole reason I am writing this is to say how great the staff was because they deserve the praise. From start to finish they were amazing. Check is was standard, quick, easy and not issues. If you need some advise on what to do around and a great drink Nick at the lobby bar was great. Super friendly and he asked very good questions which helped him both make really good recommendations for drinks he can make you as well as what you might like to do while you are there. He pointed us in the right direction on a few good spots to eat based on what we had a feeling for that day. Angeline who works at the front was super nice and sent a bottle of white wine up to our room just as a gesture of hospitality which was super nice of her. Julie was our house keeper and she was very nice to use during the trip and kept our room extremely clean. The icing on the cake for us with the staff was that we had a late flight out that night. We had decided to go hiking all day and were in need of a shower. They were 100% booked so they had already cleaned and prepped every room for the new batch of people coming in. Instead of just turning us away they went well beyond and checked and found a room for someone who was checking in late and let us use that room to clean up. This was super nice of them as obviously this meant the cleaning staff would have to come in right after to clean up again before the new guests arrived. Again I can't say enough about how great the staff was. Location - It is basically beach front. You walk about 1-2 minutes to get to the beach. It is one the end of the main strip which we thought was perfect. Extras Gym - The gym was very clean and had good machines that all worked. Free weights were limited up to 60lbs and no racks but that is pretty expected in a hotel gym. Car rental - There is a enterprise right across the street which is very convenient. Pro tip rent new each day instead of one big block as it is $40 a night to park overnight there. They were very accommodating and just let us take the same car each day anyways which just saved us $40 a night. Recommendation - Go here for the staff, clean rooms, and the value of the breakfast is overlooked as it is great value because food is a bit pricing in Waikiki in general.","Vancouver, British Columbia","Thechapells</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, British Columbia</strong>",0,5.0

Bed was comfortable (that is why are two starts) as well as was my pillow and bedding. There is a fridge that was welcomed to keep my milk and fruit cold. The pool is old and appears dirty and certainly NOT inviting. Gym was smelly. As $200 and up is NOT enough for this hotel they “had to charge” $30/day for valley parking… REALLY??? Almost ALL of the hotels that I stayed at had parking FREE, HOWEVER NOT THIS ONE! Location is about block and a half from the beach and it is in central location to go shopping. There is NO “DO NOT DISTURB” sign only the sign that says something like “Come back later” – I didn’t want them to come later – I wanted them to leave my room alone. Maid on my floor was a young Hawaiian man who was friendly and polite and provided me with items that I needed. Breakfast was included in price and it o.k. – problem for someone who stays longer and it is the same thing every morning, BUT it was good to have it available. There are two shops on the bottom floor that have some gifts at prices that are doubled from the stores that I found on the main promenade. There are two individuals who can help with tours (didn’t utilize them). Would NOT stay there next time!!!","Los Angeles, California","Suzana J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",53,2.0

(3/12 - 3/18). While it is true that it is not a beachfront property, you are about 1 1/2 blocks from the sand. I was able to score a killer rate for ~$200/night plus taxes. The hotel is valet only at $30/night but is totally worth it. (Driving/finding places to park is horrible in Honolulu). Hyatt Place also scores bonus points for 1) No nightly resort fee, 2) Complimentary full breakfast, 3) Extraordinary housekeeping staff.More on #3...We stayed in room 902 which had an obstructed view of the beach (but who stays in the room?). Our housekeeper MaryAnne couldn't have been more nice. Every morning as we left for the day she smiled, said hello, asked how we were, etc. She even joked ""leaving so soon"" as she saw us checking out. We came back from our day trips to an immaculate room with plenty of necessities for both of us (soap, towels, etc). Being a former housekeeping manager myself, I know 1st hand how difficult this job is, and how difficult it can be when guests don't treat the room with respect.

We really enjoyed our time there. It really is just a couple blocks from the beach, and the proximity to the queens beach area (in front of the park) is perfect for snorkelers as there are lots of tropical fish hanging out between the two jettys. You can walk easily from one end of waikiki to the other with no trouble at all. And the side street the hotel is located on doesnt get a lot of traffic. The staff was extremely helpful and very nice. They got us checked in early (to an upgraded ocean view room for a fair price hurray!) and when we let them know our outbound flight wasnt until the late evening, they got us a few hours later checkout at the end and held our bags securely so we could wander around for the day. That was a really really helpful, id even say essential, part of the service! We were also really happy with the housekeeping, and the front desk staff was just awesome. They were really friendly and helped us with daily beach towels and were ready to help accomodate any request it seemed. I kept wondering if I was bothering them with questions, but if it did they are real pros and didnt show it. Everyone we interacted with made us feel welcome and comfortable. Our room was clean and everything in it seemed to be good quality. The bed especially was sooooo comfy. We slept really well. It was great to have wifi and ample cable channel options as well. The only downside was the room could be noisy from the lanai, as the airconditioners from nearby buildings below and the construction nearby really echoed up (we were on the 11th floor, maybe a lower floor would get less echo). But we understood this is something out of the hotels immediate control, and it didnt stop us relaxing with coffee out there in the warm mornings. The view of the ocean was between the buildings in front of us, but was actually pretty nice! You could see the ocean all the way across the horizon, and we sort of just forgot about the couple of buildings interrupting it. Its hard to capture it with a photo.The hot breakfast wasn't gourmet but they did a really good job considering how crazy busy it was every morning. Huge shout out to the breakfast staff. I wish there had been a tip jar. They were working really hard. i was especially happy to see kimchee, rice, and miso soup offered too! Overall everything was really great, especially for the price.

I don't know if the hotel is understaffed in the housekeeping department or not but it looked as though they only make the beds and change towels for you. Other dusting or vacuuming tasks are not part of it? The room was pretty dusty and day after day, it never gets better. Maybe the 7th night in, they finally cleaned the room a bit more as one small piece of rubber that was on the floor since I checked in was finally gone. That was my marker. But the other areas such as the desk, breakfast tray, etc were still dusty.There were also times when the room was not cleaned around 5pm! I got off work and wanted to freshen up before heading out for dinner. I was very surprised to see that the room was still not ready....at 5pm. On the bright side, the front desk staff was very friendly. Matt, who checked me in, helped resolved a problem for me. When I initially booked, I booked it for myself. My mom came along with me in the end. I asked if it's possible to change to a 2 queen bed room. He took care of that for me and even checked in on me after I went upstairs to see if the room was okay for us. Now that's customer service!The breakfast option was nice. They had both hot and cold items. I like that they serve different items each day. They also serve miso soup, rice, and other side dishes for breakfast as well.

Because of that it's GREAT value. We previously stayed in a hotel that offered a kitchen because we have a small child, but found it really only came in handy for breakfast as we find breakfast is always over priced and tend to eat in our room. There are tons of great, fairly cheap options for eating lunch and dinner in Waikiki, like Me BBQ, Marukame Udon and Hi Steaks. The breakfast was up there for best breakfasts I've had in a hotel. It has all the staples: eggs, waffles, french toast, yogurt, cereals... the works... Plus a miso soup station. The highlight for me was that the cooked food was presented on Le Creuset skillets. A nice touch. It's outside so could be a little breezy. It's not the nicest outdoor setup, but also not bad. The room was modern clean and spacious (we had the 2 queens). You could tell that some of the renovations were 'cover ups' but that's okay. It's still a great looking room and we're pretty simple people so for us it's actually pretty high class. The one huge drawback for me was that the mattresses were an atrocity for a place as nice as this. You just... sink right in. My back was out of whack the whole trip.The service at the hotel was also top notch. Please give the cleaner on floor 4 a HIGH FIVE for us. What a doll. I asked for some extra cream as my hands were quite chapped coming from a cold climate. She gave me one from the cart and then when we got back to our room there was a little baggie hanging on our door with a few more. Little things like that are one of the main reasons I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The rest of the staff were chatty and courteous, though they surprisingly knew very little about the surrounding restaurants LOL.The location is near perfect for small families. If you need a comparison, the Hyatt Regency (we never stayed there) would be perfect for us as it's just right smack in the middle of everything. The Hyatt Place is a little bit further away from the shopping district, though it's right by the toddler beach, zoo and aquarium.","Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","BdBrianS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada</strong>",9,5.0

They even had a little miso soup station with rice and kimchee. Grounds are clean, staff was friendly with smiles. My room was on the 3rd floor and was only a city view but the noise was quite loud from the street. If the balcony door was open it was incredibly loud all night and all day since we are so close to the road. Elevators closest to the reception take forever on some days and stairs are locked since u have to use your room key for elevator security. Parking in wakiki sucks but we got lucky a bunch of times and got a free space on one of the side streets that don't use meters and have no special parking sign. The parking at the zoo area is only $1 an hour and it's super closer walking distance to the hotel. Will I be back to this hotel ... YES!

We did all the due diligence we could online but since I'd never been to Waikiki we weren't sure about the choice until we got there and got to know the hotel. This is a great place if you have a Family to travel with, the rooms are large, we had two queen beds and a sofa sleeper, perfect for our family of five. No resort fees, this was huge. The other hotel we were considering was right on the beach but the resort fee was an extra $40.00 per night, in the end this is closer to the beach then you think, like a really short walk and it was easy even with three kids (one a toddler), plus the hotel has plenty of fresh beach towels at the front desk and there is a convenience store next door on the way to the beach. We spent a lot of time doing touristy stuff but a couple of days just at the beach by the hotel and everything you need is a close walk from this hotel, we rented a car to go to North Shore and some other excursions and the hotel concierge got all that squared away for us. On the days we didn't travel we just had lunch and dinner at the hotel in the lobby, decent prices and good food. If you want something more food wise there are a ton of choices to walk to. On the free breakfast this was a huge plus with the kids, I've read a few reviews saying it could be better....Are you kidding? Pancakes, waffles, fruit, bacon, eggs, granola, yogurt, cereal, pastries, muffins, sausage, eggs benedict (one of the days but still), orange juice, apple juice, coffee, milk, french toast, bagels...I mean seriously for a breakfast included and no resort fees? I've paid for breakfast buffets in Vegas that weren't this good. Did I mention it's free? Some people are snobby I guess. One extra note about housekeeping, the service was good but when I lost a hoodie that happened to be very close in color to the beach towels they give out at the front desk housekeeping went above an beyond, found the hoodie, it was cleaned and folded neatly on the bed the next day with a nice note attached. I think I probably tossed the hoodie in the towel return by accident, or maybe they grabbed it in the room in a pile of towels when they cleaned it but nonetheless nice service. The gift shop in the back is independent, but he does have snorkel gear and boogie boards for $5.00 for all day...very handy. On top of all this the hotel on the beach we almost stayed at? We still used their beach front restaurant twice and saved all those resort fees...based on the reviews online the rooms were dinky there as well, so the Hyatt Place was perfect. The gym wasn't spectacular but gets the job done, laundry onsite if you need it and a pool on the smaller side, but it was never too crowded and the ocean is right there. One night they had wine tasting in the open lobby and lei making another afternoon. If you want the touristy trip like we did this works, they also have a deal with a local cab company, $29.00 to and from the airport plus we used the same cab company for Pearl Harbor and other places, always with a deep discount.","Lake Forest, California","d s</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lake Forest, California</strong>",25,5.0

But, when I arrived - there was a big issue - the ocean-front room with balcony I had paid for (and saw a photo of in the description when booking) was replaced with a semi-ocean front room where the balcony faced the street and it was more of a peephole window to the ocean, which was disappointing. The front desk agreed to move me to a proper room that had the balcony but it'd have to wait until the next day. This delayed my opportunity to truly feel relaxed on this trip. Additionally, the parking - there is a claim of self parking which I quite enjoy but here, it was only valet. Had I known that, I might have chosen differently. Regardless, the hotel did offer a comp on the parking in light of the room snafu, and recovered well, hence why I upped to a Very Good rating.","Seattle, Washington","JohnThomas84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",29,4.0

The hotel has been obviously upgraded and looks fresh and reasonably new. The bus stops in front of the hotel on Kuhio Avenue. All buses from there will take you directly to the airport, downtown, Pearl Harbour and the Ala Moana shopping mall, all without transferring buses. The bus costs $2.50 per person each way. There are scores of restaurants, bars and food trucks within a five minute walk of the hotel. The shopping is also a 5-10 minute walk away.

A few days in we decided to extend our vacation by 3 days because it was rainy a few days and wanted to enjoy Hawaii a bit more so we changed our flights but the hotel couldn't accommodate us so we ended up moving to Waikiki resort hotel for quite a bit cheaper and same quality if not better... even when you take Hyatts breakfast into account.

Siting by the pool, with so many breakfast choices, we were very happy to have this free meal to start our days.We had a rental car to tour the island, and he parking was by Valet, which was extremely efficient and so nice - offering suggestions and help every time we grabbed the car.You don't need a car in Waikiki though - this hotel is right near where the tourist buses pick up passengers. We could have just walked a block and hopped on the bus to go to Pearl Harbour, the outlet mall, pipeline - it's a handy spot to stay.We also loved the sunrise walks along Waikiki beach, and encountering the bird man at the end of the wharf.

We didn't rent a car, but Charley's taxi has fixed price from airport to hotel ($29) and there is public transportation easily accessible. We arrived early morning with normal check in st 3pm. We were given towels so we could enjoy the beach in the meantime. The staff worked hard to have a room ready shortly after noon, even accommodating our ocean view request! When we asked for breakfast restaurant suggestion, we were offered their hot breakfast right off the lobby. It is included in the cost of the room, so we didn't expect much. We were pleasantly surprised with scrambled eggs, sausage or bacon and French toast or pancakes. Being able to enjoy it even prior to our room access was especially appreciated. The pastries, fresh fruit, coffee and juice were also yummy. We commented several times to each other how pleased we were with our hotel selection.

The following comments is based on my personal experience that I felt needed improvement: 1. Self-parking is not available and valet parking is $30/day. That is a huge expense that my company does not pay for. Customer service representatives tried their best to assist but management states they cannot compliment the parking. It's unfortunate that Hyatt Place Waikiki couldn't comp the parking when a 5-star hotel like the Sheraton Waikiki can. 2. Room is small and noisy; insulation is pretty non-existent. It's hard to feel tranquil in the room. The hotel has a funny smell in the hallway and you can tell is old. Bed is very comfortable and the housekeeping crew is fabulous. The crew always had a smile and said, ""Aloha !"" 3. Food and beverage is like most hotel; expensive for average quality. The breakfast has a nice selection but the bacon is paper thin. Seriously, it's paper thin. Breakfast does not change except of the main meat which differs 4-5 times out of the week. After staying for so long; it became monotonous so I just skip breakfast at the hotel. 3. Staff really cares but management has not shown they care the whole time I was there. Craig would pack me fruits when I am not able to stay for breakfast or when they are closing the breakfast bar. He was great; always so friendly and thoughtful! Joshua did his best to assist with my parking situation but everything stops at management level. For some reason, management only works M-F 8-5 in a 24-hour operation so it was difficult for me to connect with him. As a matter of fact I didn't see one before 7 am or after 5pm.","Phenix City, Alabama","lyny2017</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phenix City, Alabama</strong>",0,3.0

Pretty much the same thing each day, but still a good variety of stuff so you could change things up. I don't think people realize how important a free breakfast is until you are trying to find a place to eat and walk out paying 25 dollars..We didn't use the pool nor did we have any desire to but it was quite small. Also didn't have a car so can't comment on parking. Location is excellent. Beach was minutes away and it was a nice, quite area of the beach (as opposed to further up where it is ++ crowded). Free towels and umbrellas were well appreciated. Our flight on check out was at 11h30pm. We checked out at 11, left our luggage with the staff and they gave us a hospitality room for an hour to freshen up before our flight.

The rooms were pleasant and very quiet -- we never heard any other guests. Lest you think I am just all sunshine and roses, the air conditioner was a bit loud, I would have liked a desk drawer or two, and some of the guests at breakfast had no concept of personal space (and were obnoxiously pushy).

The room had a fridge so a trip (4 blocks?) up Kuhio street to the Food Pantry for groceries is recommended as there aren't many affordable restaurants nearby.

The hotel was satisfactorily clean (not sparkling new, but I did not have to shower in flip-flops). The staff was very responsive which was the best part of the entire experience. Having only the two elevators is a little frustrating during peak times. The ""mountain view"" is a bit of a joke because you see only a sliver of mountain between two other hotels. The breakfast arrangement on the third floor is also a bit undesirable, with an outdoor setup only satisfactory on the most beautiful of days (they need a better back-up plan for rainy days). The location is NOT good if you want to be close to the high-end Waikiki shops (they are a 15 minute walk away from here). But to be honest, who really wants to be located where it's so busy? We quite enjoyed that it was at the far end of the stretch of beaches - we could walk to the nearest beach (2 blocks away) and find a space in the sand without crowds. Pedestrian and street traffic was also less. I know that it seems like this is an overall negative review, but I think that for a traveler that wants to do Waikiki for a reasonable amount of money this is a pretty solid option. For someone who has to stay in Waikiki but wants to avoid the hustle-bustle of Waikiki, this is as good a location as any.

Good location to the beach and Continental breakfast comes in handy.

The public beach 2 small blocks away from the hotel is okay, just not as good as in the middle or upper part of waikiki beach. So it just depends on what you are looking for out of your trip. Pool at Hyatt place is nothing to call home to mom about either.

At time of booking 6 months earlier I politely requested for an early check in. This wasn't to be which is fair enough however I was not communicated with. I arrived at the hotel at 830am, was told the room might be ready by 12. Went for a walk up and down the beach, did some shopping, ate and then returned at 12, the room was still not ready and I asked if any efforts could be made to get in a little earlier at 2pm as opposed to their suggested 3pm. I fell asleep on the lobby couch which was (embarrassing but) comfortable, only to wake up around 2pm and be told the room is still not ready... They tried to upsell me another room which was available immediately for $30USD per day, and over 7 days it adds up so I politely declined. Why not give it complimentary and show some service or acknowledgement for me waiting so long!!?? I eventually got into the room at 2:45pm however it was on a level below as the original room was still not ready. At the end of the day you get what you pay for but I have not had a good experience at this place, next time I'll be staying elsewhere and spending a little extra for what will hopefully be a better place with better service and housekeeping. Oh and one other thing, being very picky here, the shower water pressure is missing, it's a bit like their housekeeping, MIA!

Also the only parking options were to valet for $30 per night or a public parking structure across the street for $20 per night or street parking.

This was our fourth stop on this trip, two on the Big Island and then Ko Olina and ending for my husband's birthday at the Hyatt Place for 4 nights to end our trip. We were thrilled at Hyatt members, to be upgraded to an oceanview room with a balcony in the new tower! Check in could not have been easier and the reception staff very helpful. Our room was the smallest of the 4 places we stayed, but it was well designed and had everything you would need, included a very large safe for all your valuables and computer. The room included a most thoughtful tray to take down to the lovely included breakfast in case someone wanted to take breakfast for themselves or others up to the room! Hot dishes for breakfast and pastries changed daily in addition to all the usual staples. The fruit was fresh and delicious and perfect ripeness.. They were very accommodating to us for our request for a custom benny with no pork. The pool is quite small, but you have Waikiki Beach at your beck and call just blocks away including some very good snorkeling. Shopping and all sites within Waikiki were walkable as well as great restaurant choices. The shopping scene has also escalated to world class with the newly redone International Marketplace including Sak's Fifth Avenue and Laboutin and much more.. Ala Moana's extension was jaw dropping with the new restaurant level and Shirokiya and Sears were replaced by Bloomingdales and every other name boutique you could think of. While Shirokiya was gone, the epic food floor was replaced by an expanded Japanese Walk that was all kinds of Asian delicacies and their famous $1 beer. Beach towels were available at the desk, newspapers around, 2 gift shops and there were snacks for sale and Happy Hour at the bar in the lobby with several tvs and welcoming couches was very inviting, in addition to the computers for guests. Hyatt Place was an excellent value and a great brand point as part of the Hyatt family while getting the benefits of breakfast and wifi and nice amenities in room. No bathrobes. You will be made to feel at home and Hyatt Place's location is excellent.

Just a few examples of what was awful: Stale bread used for breakfast French toast. Burned coffee. Getting breakfast in the poorly laid-out, dirty, self-serve poolside area was like running an obstacle course. The only thing palatable was the pineapple; after a few days of trying this and that gross piece of breakfast fare in an unpleasant environment I started eating out every morning. Everything I ate everywhere else was delightful, whether I paid more or less. Bear in mind you'll be eating poolside, three stories up, listening to the racket from the street and defending your breakfast food from attacking pigeons no matter the hour or the weather. If you have to be up and out early and it's raining, you'll be sitting in the dark and the rain listening to trash compactors eating stale, soggy, bland food while you shiver and wonder what bad karma sent you to such a dismal place. If you try to use the pool as a pool after breakfast, you'll find it's just as cold and noisy, because by the time breakfast is cleaned up this ""roof side pool"" on the third floor of the building is completely encased in the shadow of the towers in the same hotel. Poolside area is dank, floors stained, no one uses it except for the forced march of breakfast. And yeah, kids throw food in the pool during breakfast. So that's nice. About the room: there was sand and mold in my shower on arrival--and not cleaned for the next week. Cracks in wall in bathroom. Dirty footprints on my pillowcase and bloodstains on the sheets. I kid you not. In other ways, too, housekeeping was appalling. The whole room (and I hated it enough that I looked at others, but none I saw were any better) was terribly designed. It's large but laid out badly so it feels like a prison regardless. The desk is tucked in a corner with no windows and no light from the windows reaches it. The desk lamp creates a pinpoint glare on its own base but no actual illumination for the workspace. The ground is not level and the chair is a swivel seat, which keeps swiveling away in response to gravity, so you literally have to anchor yourself with a limb or tie yourself down if you want to sit facing the desk. In other words, the space is totally unusable. The king-sized bed was somehow way smaller than any other king-size I've slept on. A faux king, made just for the Hyatt? The bed and sofa face each other. Neither, oddly, faces the TV. If you want to watch TV, get used to it being at an off angle and crane your neck accordingly. The bathroom mirror/sink area is super dark. Ladies and metrosexuals: you won't be able to do any detail work on your hair or makeup in there. The whole place is dark dark dark. There is a small, grimy, uncomfortable balcony attached to the room. Not a fun place to spend any time, and recessed in such a way as to block both the view and the light. There is an in-house bar. Order beer or something. Don't try the cocktails. I tried the overpriced mai tai and it was the worst (at best second-worst) cocktail of my life. There is no room service. You can pick up and carry back to your own room any food you'd like to order--but don't. The alleged ""grilled chicken pesto panini with goat cheese"" that I ordered was the worst sandwich I've ever paid $14 for. I wouldn't pay $4 for that bait-and-switch sandwich. What they did is toast some flavorless Wonderbread-variety bread (not the ""panini bread"" they advertise), put some apparently boiled or microwaved chicken in there (not ""grilled"" as advertised), melt some greasy flavorless white cheese on it (not goat, as advertised), omit the pesto (as far as I could tell), and keep the proportion of the vegetables advertised so low that you basically won't know they're there. Worst. Sandwich. Ever. If you're going to serve a grilled cheese with boiled chicken sandwich, just call it that. Grrrr. Let's see, what else... the elevators are so crowded you have to wait a good long while to use them. I was not on a low floor but ended up taking the stairs to save myself the wait. Saw other young, able-bodied people making the same choice. The gym exists. Better than nothing, but barely. Stinky and poorly ventilated, so I didn't manage to get in a good workout after all before feeling lousy and leaving. Book at your own risk. Oh, and repeated miscommunication with the front desk staff to top things off. Just hated this place. Getting out of there was like being released from prison.

I'm really picky about my hotels as I don't see them as ""just a bed"". I spent ages reading reviews and weighing up pros and cons before finally booking this hotel. I booked through Booking.com but due to some of the negative reviews on here, I contacted the hotel directly explaining what I was looking for, especially as we were spending 11 nights here and wanted everything to be right. We were offered a $15 per night upgrade which gave us a much better room in size and aspect. This was totally worth doing. The hotel responds quickly to emails and are very helpful. We arrived at 8:30am and as I'd let them know we were arriving early, they kindly had 1 room ready so we could get on with enjoying our time here. The room we have is spacious, clean and modern. The bathroom is not large but adequate and clean. We have no complaints with breakfast, I'll post photos to give you an idea of some of the options. There's plenty of choice and we have saved a lot of money not eating breakfast out. The breakfast area is busy, we always wander down 1/2 an hour before it's due to finish so that might explain something! We could take a tray back to our room but we've always found a table for the 5 of us.The hotel is a short easy stroll to the beach. We stayed at the other end of the beach last time but much prefer this end. It's still lively and there are some excellent restaurants and fast food places including Starbucks very close by. There's an ABC store about 2 doors away for snacks, alcohol, sandwiches and essential groceries. We are in there a lot! The pool area is small and not luxurious but it's pleasant to lie around if you want a break from the crowds of Waikiki. We've had it to ourselves at times. The family have loved using the gym.

However, the Waikiki Beach Hyatt Place did not meet expectations. The staff - starting with the valet (and $40 a night with no self parking option seems very steep - and it did take 20-3- minutes, even after calling down, to get the car) to the check in/desk staff were not overly welcoming. The room, with the partial, mostly obstructive ocean view, was itsy bitsy - especially in the bathroom, but I do have to say it was clean. But most of the frontline staff did not go out of their way to be helpful. Breakfast - one of the reasons we love Hyatt Place - was a bit of a disaster. It is served on the pool deck (if you can call it that - will address that in a minute) was extremely crowded and other guest were hovering waiting for you to finish. I get it -- it was Christmas week, and the hotel was booked -- but one of the days we were there, it was windy and rainy, and 95% of the seating was open air, so there was nowhere to sit to eat, and the covered area was packed. We ended up taking our plates and bowls up to our room and eating picnic style on the floor. And because the hotel was so crowded, breakfast staff worked very hard to keep clean bowls, plates, silverware, and cups out (which was made more difficult since everyone had to run back to their rooms). They did a good job in restocking the breakfast items and drinks. The pool was miniscule. I guess it meets the minimum size to being called a ""pool"". I asked if the hotel had any type of reciprocity with the other Hyatt (four blocks away) or resort to allow HP guests to use their real pools with pool side services for a nominal fee. I was met with blank stares. A lot of guests maybe would not take advantage of it, but it seems like it should be a viable options to those who did not want to go a very crowded, narrow public beach. (the bigger and nicer beaches seemed to be associated with the bigger hotels on the beach.Next time, we would opt to pay a little more and stay at one of the bigger resorts.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Shelliedc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",11,3.0

I would change the following if possible: -- Breakfast area is outside with VERY LIMITED cover which was uncomfortable because it misted every morning during breakfast. They need more cover. -- We rented a car, but were unable to park at the hotel because it was full and the parking attendants didn't seem too empathetic. We parked across the street at the Banyan hotel and in the end, preferred doing that because it was cheaper and more convenient than the Hyatt, but that first night we were concerned. -- During busy times, it can take a long time to get down or up with so many floors and only 2 elevators.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","E R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",6,4.0

Not really nice to have a breakfast under the rain.Hard to get spoon; cup and plates because need to wait that they are clean. Probably a good recommendation to the hotel director would be to buy more cups; plates ; fork and knife.Back to the breakfast location; because it is so crowded that many people take back the food to their rooms.I'm sure the hotel could easily improve the breakfast management at minimum cost.You're in Honolulu for the beach but be aware that Hyatt swimming pool is really really small.On the positive point- Kind staff.- Location is good.

The hotel/building is a bit dated but the rooms have been upgraded with modern furniture (typical HP style). Our room was big for Waikiki standards. There was plenty of space for my family (myself, husband and 2 young boys aged 7 and 9). The lanai is nice to have but nothing to write home about - small and narrow but has patio furniture for you to sit and have a coffee/beverage. I asked for city view and boy did I get that. We were on the 5th floor and our lanai was overlooking the roofs of other buildings...and other people's apartments! The room, while spacious, was showing its age especially in the washroom. The bathtub showed wear and tear and so did the grout/tiles in the bathroom. The biggest complaint I had with this HP is that it isn't on the greatest side of Waikiki. It sits between Kuhio Ave (which is apparently pretty sketchy at night) and an alleyway. You can hear the noise of people and cars coming and going at all times of the day/night but I guess I should expect that in busy Waikiki. The alley way where this hotel is beside has one other hotel across from it (Ewa Hotel) and beside that hotel is a hostel or two!!! There's an ABC store right beside the hotel which is quite convenient but then again there's an ABC store on everyone corner in the Waikiki Beach area. I noticed that there were a few homeless people walking/hanging out near the area too...Location is close to Waikiki Beach closer to Diamond Head. It's less than a 3 minute walk away. The hotel is close by to fast food joints like Burgee King and McDonalds. It's a few minutes (7-10 mins) to the International Market Place. The HP is so close to Honolulu Zoo - less than 5 min walk. I made the mistake of hauling my fam to walk to Diamond Head from the hotel. It is a good 50-55 minute walk to the entrance of Diamond Head park/trail. And another 1-2 hrs to do the round-trip hike up and down the DH trail. Wear sneakers (no flip flops); it's rocky and some areas are steep. I saw some ppl in their flip flops and I'm not sure they were comfy at all. If you walk to DH, entrance fee is $1 per person. If you drive, the carload is $5. There's an awesome food truck at the base of the entrance (the only one, so bring cash with you. I guarantee you're going to get thirsty or hungry after you've made the round trip up/down Diamond Head...shave ice for $4, hot dog for $4, fresh coconut for $6, etc. We rented a car and had used the valet service for the entire stay at the HP. I wasn't about to try to find street parking. The hotel charges $30/night which I thought was reasonable for Waikiki standards. (We stayed at Aulani and it was $42 per nite for baker). Valet service was great and quick. The guys were attentive and polite. I don't know how they do it because the entrance to the hotel is so narrow and tight. The hotel staff were really pleasant and truly customer service oriented including the room attendant. We wanted to warm up food (leftovers) and because the room doesn't have a microwave, I went down to the main floor/bar area where they warmed it up for me. They offer a free breakfast too. We took advantage of that for the 2 mornings we were there. They switch up the offerings every day and I can't complain. With HI prices being so expensive in general, it was nice to have a free breakfast to start your day ie. cereal, yogurt, fruits, bagels, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. I used the fitness room during my stay. It was tricky finding it at first but when I did, I certainly took advantage of what they had to offer. (The fitness room is on the same floor where they serve the buffet breakfast which is where the pool is too). There are some free weights, a few treadmills (6 I think), elliptical, etc. There are towels for you to use as well. Love that it's also open 24/7. During my last morning there, I woke up early because we had to catch a morning flight, and I was the only there at 515-600am. The pool is tiny! The days we were there, no one was in there. There is some seating around the pool but it is very limited. Noticed that it really isn't kid-friendly. I think the shallowest end is 3.5 ft. Although I didn't take advantage of the pool, I saw that the hotel offered towels. We took advantage of the laundry room. There are only 2-3 washing machines and 3-4 dryers. Anyway, we did 1 load of laundry. $3 for use of each. Detergentsis $2. They only accept exact change or credit card. Used my CC and it was very convenient. Washer is about 30-35 mins per load and the dryer is about 45 mins per load. While we enjoyed our stay at the HPWB, we will likely try another hotel if and when we do come back to Waikiki (concerned about location...with kids). Maybe we will try the Hyatt Regency off Kalakaua instead? If m husband and I are the only ones travelling, I would certainly consider staying here again. Overall, we have no major complaints with this HP - for me the reason I'm giving them 4 stars is due to location.

What a beautiful room. I was taken aback by the generosity and hospitality that was shown to us by the staff at this hotel. The lobby is beautifully decorated, the rooms are immaculate and clean, the beds are like sleeping on clouds. The breakfast is beyond amazing, something for everyone. Some reviews on here have complained about the elevators being slow but they always arrived quickly for me. The concierge lady named Mackenzie is also so friendly and helpful. The location of this hotel is amazing. Very close to the beach and close to many shopping centers and places to eat. I honestly couldn't have asked for anything better and although our tropical Christmas vacation started out rocky, I can thank this hotel's incredible service for making the rest of it a postcard perfect adventure. We don't check out until the 24th and I cant wait to see what else this amazing island offers, all with the comfort and help of this amazing hotel.

I had just arrived in HNL for a quick stopover before traveling onward. I saw pictures of this hotel and saw it had an affordable price for the area. I wasted no time in booking it. I got off the bus to find the hotel is right next to the bus stop which makes it very convenient and safe. I entered the building right off the street and it was like stepping into an chic oasis. The check in area was very clean and pretty. The check in staff was very friendly and gave me tips and suggestions on how to make the most of my 12 hour stopover. The check in process was quick for those of you who like that, however, as a transportation and hospitality worker, I enjoy talking with fellow workers.The elevator can only be used with a keycard, which gave me an extra sense of security. My room was very nice and very clean, with a decent view and balcony, as well as a great selection of hygiene products. The morning breakfast service was great with a large local selection and clean dining area with good views of the city, and even a lounge area. The check-out process was a breeze and I had even had an express-check out option. I took my quick 1 minute walk to the bus stop to the airport and went on to my next destination. I typically stay in Marriott hotels as Hyatt does not have any in the destinations I travel, however, I will definitely be staying here again the next time I visit Honolulu which will be soon. I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Honolulu and wants a close and convenient hotel near the beach.","Detroit, Michigan","Bailey G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Detroit, Michigan</strong>",2,5.0

One reason is the room configuration, a separate living area and a work desk. The facility in Waikiki has neither!!! You get a big closet for a room. No couch no desk. The air conditioning is a heat pump so it never gets cool. There is no electric ventilation in the bath room. they expect you to open a window when you shower. You book a Hyatt place because of the extra room size and this place is as I said a large closet. Staff are great, but they did skip room clean up one day. The food, breakfast is acceptable and the facility is clean. The 24 hour food service is a good option, especially in Waikiki, good value. Problem is service they do double duty so if someone happens to check in you starve. Great location to walk or use the bus.

Every staff member we encountered (starting with Troy at check-in) was friendly and helpful. Lots of aloha spirit!We had an Ocean View King room on the 14th floor of the shorter tower and, while a bit small, it was modern and maximized for space. For example, no bedside tables but rather bedside shelves. We stored our carry-ons under them. No lamps on the shelves but rather wall-mounted. More storage room! Same goes for the unit in the bathroom. There was plenty of room to store things. The room was clean and cleaned efficiently. The best thing was opening the door to a view of the ocean right in front of us every day. Breakfast was wonderful and had lots of variety: cereal, pastries, juice (apple, orange, tomato), milk, eggs/egg sandwiches, breakfast meat, fresh fruit, cottage cheese, granola, yogurt, toast, english muffins, jam, peanut butter, waffles/french toast....if you can't find something to eat here than you have a problem.My only issue with the hotel is a small one and that is that I wish they would have had Hawaiian music playing everywhere. The lobby, the elevators, the breakfast area, etc. It's something I was really looking forward to and I only heard it in one place: the 1st fl bathrooms by the elevator bank. (Oh, and if was in management, I'd talk to the management of the Aston hotel next door about all of their smokers lining the sidewalk. Having to run that gauntlet on every trip to Kalakaua Ave and/or the beach was annoying).All in all, a great stay and I would definitely stay here again!","Baltimore, Maryland","RubyinMD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Baltimore, Maryland</strong>",11,5.0

From start to finish this is a good hotel. Check in was really easy. We were a little early so we went off and had lunch down at the beach. We received a text from the front desk when the room was ready. This was a nice touch and my 3 kids (not really kids anymore) soon learnt that the hotel liked texting you about things. Not just how we rated the hotel bla bla but about things that were important to us. Our room was great. It was big and the 4 of us fitted in easily. Good wifi which worked well in our room and all around the hotel. ...wifi is important to me as I'm constantly in touch with work and of course my 3 kids live on it as well. Nice bathroom with lots of towels. The TV is good and well placed in the room so no one has a problem seeing it no matter where you are. All the beds were firm but comfortably - I like firm so suits me! Even the sofa bed was comfortable. The complimentary breakfast is a real winner. Nothing over the top but good enough for a start to the day. The hotel is handy to the beach - maybe a 3-4 minute walk and I must say it's nice to be at the relatively quiet end of Waikiki. We were in Waikiki at a busy time (75th Pearl Harbor Anniversary) and the the other end of the beach for me is simply too busy. We are beach people and I must say that each time we went we were supplied with beach towels which was handy as we'd all forgotten to bring towels! I think the only negative I would make is that there are only 2 lifts and with 19 floors (I think) they were very slow and crowded. That's pretty much my only criticism. Would I stay here again?

Our room was a king and seemed quite spacious, with a nice bathroom and glass front shower. A good sized closet and a safe were useful. The breakfast was near the pool area on the 3rd floor, and at times quite windy, so the hotel provided a tray in our room in case we wanted to bring the food back. Every single staff member we encountered was smiling, pleasant, and genuinely happy to be there. So refreshing!

Maybe because it was not the high season, but had no troubles with elevators. Rooms are specious. Bed are very comfortable and bedlinen are changed every 3rd day. You have large LCD TV, fridge, mini-safe and iron board in every room. Staff in reception is superb, helpful and friendly. Since check-out is already at 11am (an we had flight at the evening), hotel offers you (if you ask) for a 30min hospitality room, where you can have quick shower, changes your clothes and get ready for your long flight back to home. You can also ask for late check-out (6pm), which costs half of the price of the standard room rate for that day (in our case 120USD, which we thought to be unreasonable high). Room cleaning was still more like pretending to do some cleaning, there was dust and dirt anywhere which didn’t disappear during our 9 night stay. As well we couldn’t figure out the time for room cleaning, once they run in our room before 9am at weekend when we were still sleeping, then some days they didn’t show up till 8pm till we asked reception for a change of the towels. Free WiFi was usually working well. In high-peak usage time it got slower. The complimentary breakfast was extremely modest and you got fed of the same food already at 3rd day. There was really nothing to put on bread (no ham, no cheese, not single vegetables), mainly cereals, juice and yogurt, bread. Hotel is 2-min walk from beach. Beach is sandy and nice. You can ask beach towels from reception. As it seems typical in Waikiki, the parking is unreasonable costly in all the hotels. Hyatt offers overnight parking for 35USD. But in Kapiolani park (which is 350m) from the hotel, there is free parking 24/7. Huge traffic jams starts in all around the island from 4pm and last till 6pm. Avoid driving at that time, since you just waste your precious time in sitting in slow moving traffic for an hours. The bus stop is just near to the hotel. If you need to travel within Waikiki, then by foot will be faster since bus stops are in every 50m and as well traffic-light in every 100m. 5km of travel by bus takes approx. an hour or more, which is rather same with walking.",Tallinn,"Rainer O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tallinn</strong>",51,4.0

Don't forget the lovely beds! Also a big fan of the decor in the lobby/bar area. 3. Free breakfast with rotating hot entrees such as waffles, french toast & breakfast sandwiches along with cereals, breads, fruit, juices, coffee and more. 4. Barely 1.5 blocks from the beach, at the quieter end of Waikiki, but still an easy walk to the heart of Waikiki, lots of great restaurants, ABC stores, coffee, shopping, etc. It is all within easy reach. Beach towels are also available at the front desk!  5. Lovely staff. Plenty of smiles and aloha spirit. Loyalty that's recognized. Matthew (I think that was his name???) who checked in all three of us with ease even though we were all on three separate reservations. He also was able to accommodate us all on the same floor in the same tower which was much appreciated. And Bartender Nick, who is such an outstanding employee. He's a true ambassador for Hyatt and also for the island. Don't be afraid to ask for island recommendations as you enjoy the delicious happy hour drinks. That's if he doesn't ask you first. :) 6.

We really could not fault it. Every time we approached the front desk we were greeted with a smile and a friendly approach. The included breakfast outdoors on the deck was very good with a variety to suit all tastes. The green apples in the bowl at reception were well re lived by all in our family! We were 2 adults and 4 children in one room. It worked fine with the 6 of us sharing 2 queen beds and a pull out sofa. Initially there were only 4 bath towels in our room so we phoned for another two. About 10 minutes later, housekeeping called the room to check that we had received the towels and finished with a promise to ensure there were always 6 in the room - lovely service. Thank you to all of the staff at the Hyatt Place, the only hotel I have found that will have 6 in a room - you saved us a lot of money by not having to get a second room! We will definitely recommend this hotel. i should mention that Valet Parking was also a terrific option for US$30 per day - saved lots of parking hassle with a family. The beach is about a 3 minute walk and great at sunset - the hotel provides beach towels.","Sydney, Australia","Madlen392</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",9,5.0

Views were somewhat limited as you are surrounded by other big buildings. But hey, you dont stay in a hotel for the views... My room was a little small. Wifi access was a little spotty at times. Biggest issue was limited parking in the building. For my 7 day trip, I essentially parked across the street at the banyan garage which is 20$ for a 24 hr period. I had to go out at 10pm every day to purchase a new permit. The location is fairly close to the freeway entrance and you dont have to drive through the hustle and bustle of waikiki area to get to it.

It is a very quick walk to the beach and there are also plenty of shops and restaurants in walking distance. It is also easy to get to/from the hotel. Charlie taxi company will take you from the airport to the hotel or from the hotel and to the airport for a flat rate of $29 each way. When we called for them to pick us up, they were there within 5 minutes. The room was clean and adequate, but nothing special. Our city-view room had a very small section of the beach visible from our balcony so that was a nice surprise. There is no extra resort fee added to the cost of the roomThe breakfast was good for a free breakfast. Each day the hot offering changed.The first day they had bacon, eggs and pancakes. The second day there was sausage, eggs and waffles. The third day there were biscuits with ham and egg on top of them and French toast. The fourth day there were English muffins with egg and ham. Every day they had fresh fruit and yogurt and bagels and some kind of pastry and some Japanese food offerings. They had milk, orange juice, apple juice, water and coffee available. There were a few tables indoors but most of the seating was outside. That was not ideal when it was raining or sunny and hot with no shade. There were trays available in your room so you could take your breakfast back to your room. The fitness room was very nice. The equipment all looked pretty new and there was a lot of it. I never saw anyone in there though. They had a bathroom and filtered water cooler also in the fitness room.Our room was very dark. There was no overhead light. There were two little lights on each side of the bed, a small desk lamp and one other little light. There was a blinking light in the corner by the ceiling that was annoying at night. The air conditioner also made a beep periodically throughout the night too every time it was about to kick on so that was annoying. The room was otherwise quiet at night. When we arrived, the sheets had old blood stains on them which was disgusting so I left a note for them to change them the next day. They did, however they didn't make up the room until 4 PM and then didn't leave us any clean bath towels. On our last day I asked the cleaning lady at 3pm if she could do our room next because we didn’t have any towels and wanted to shower before we left. She was very polite but said no, because she had to do all the check-outs first. She came by an hour later at 4pm and offered to clean the room then. We told her she didn’t need to anymore because we were already packing to leave and all our bags were all over the room since our flight home was in a few hours. She did provide us with clean towels at that time.The pool is very tiny but no one was ever in it so you could have it all to yourself if you wanted to get in. I dipped a foot in and it felt very cold. They did have towels by the pool and you could borrow them to go to the beach. There are rental chairs and umbrellas available nearby on the beach but they are expensive to rent. It was $40 a day for an umbrella and chair and $20 a day for just a lounge chair. Instead, I bought a chair at the ABC store for $20. It was not a lounge chair but it had good back support. I gave it to someone else to use on our last day.I gave it 3 stars because the location and breakfast were good, but the 4pm daily room cleaning really bothered me.

Knowing that since we were going to be in Kauai first, and we didn't want to spend a ton of money on a hotel, we decided on Hyatt Place, with the number main reason being that a hot breakfast was included with the cost of the stay. I did find a cheaper rate online than what was listed on Hyatt's website, but they have a great price matching process, so ended up getting a really good deal. The hotel is only about 2 blocks away from the beach. There's a lot of stores around (ABC Stores) so if you ever need anything wise, you can always go out and buy stuff. Also, if you forget certain toiletries, the front desk does have some that you can buy or they'll give you for free. I'm so surprised at how great this hotel was. Very clean and very modern. We stayed in the newer tower, on the 10th floor. We had a semi view of the ocean. Granted, one of the reason why ended up with this hotel was because we figured we'd be out more than in the hotel so we didn't mind that we had a semi view of the ocean (which was true, we did not spend a lot of time at the hotel). Room was small but I do like that it was very clean. We had so much luggage since we just came from Kauai so trying to organize all of our luggages was a challenge. Like most places there is no self parking at this hotel - it's all valet. I also liked that they had a texting option if you had any questions or concerns, and they were very responsive. I would highly recommend this place to stay if you don't want to shell out a lot of money on a room!","Seattle, Washington","Joann U</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",33,5.0

The ac unit was loud and noise from the outside could be heard despite our balcony door being closed and being on the 10th floor. The ac also seemed to be weak as we needed to lower the temp significantly just to feel cool. The complimentary breakfast was good and had several hot and cold options.

That is quite a long time to stay in a hotel. We did learn some tricks during our stay. Signing up for the monthly parking plan at the Banyan (only $180 per month) instead of $25 a night was one of them. You must go during their office hours (they're open Sat morning), and it's only good from the 1st to the 31st. Also, taking the stairs is sometimes critical if you're in the Pali tower- either stay on a low enough floor, or stay in the Diamond Head tower. Pali only has 2 elevators, and we have waited as long as 15 minutes to catch elevators in the past!!!There was a one-time pet fee of $175. That's it. No nightly fee, nothing else.

I was asked to stay at the same Ocean View room for two days and switch back to mountain view for next two days. They asked me to switch room first and decision to let us stay in the same room at the afternoon. They don't inform us until I called in to confirm when and how they are going to move my stuffs at the last min. Furthermore, I had to rushed back my room before 11 and and packed my stuffs and ready to do it. In conclusion, it is not acceptable of the arrangement. It wasted my entire morning and cannot plan out for other things. Attention to mgr team: We are platinum member and we felt like a rush cat and running around because of the inconvenience that you staffs had made. They should offer me to stay in the same room at the first check in just like other Hyatt that we where stay in the past. I am not happy for this staff interactions at all. In addition, we had asked my fr who also booked the same hotel at the same period of time, because we love Hyatt, but the arrangement was very disappointed.","San Jose, United States","Tze C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, United States</strong>",0,2.0

We spent some time at Waikiki, but had a car and traveled around the island. The hotel was generally easy to get to, towards the end of the Waikiki beach area, and was close to restaurants and convenient stores if needed. It was a great place to start and end our day, and had options when we spent our day there. The rooms were clean, service was unimaginably considerate, and I seriously loved the text feature for requests and checking on our stay.

Location is great. Just a couple blocks back from Waikiki beach. Room was small but well laid out and fully efficient. We were in 1401 which had excellent beach views and sunset views from our wraparound balcony. I am unsure if the view would be as good from lower floors since there would be buildings blocking the beach. Breakfast was delicious and served on the 3 floor, out by the pool. Seemed very well staffed and items were constantly being replenished. The pool is small and we didn't use it but many people seemed pleased with it and I will say that it had beautiful tile work on it. The bed in our room was probably the most comfortable bed I've ever had at a hotel. All of the staff was pleasant and welcoming. There is an ABC store next door which is nice when wanting snacks or beverages. On top of all that, the price couldn't be beat either! Overall, I'd stay here again in a heartbeat but would say it's best suited for those who have seen Waikiki before or don't need a luxury resort feel.

The property itself nests behind the Aston to the makai side, and the Marriot on the eva side of the street, and is a classic twin-tower rectangular floor-plate high-rise with a connecting lobby and drive-up port-a-coche in front. This is, in fact, a sweet spot location with just a short stroll to one of the better beaches for swimming and surfing, and also walking distance to all Waikiki has to offer.....as such, recommend you do not bring a car as daily hotel parking is $30, and valet gridlock as well as wait times can get lengthy during crunch periods. TIP- daily car rental independents are on Kuhio Street just behind the hotel and many cost less than the parking fee; you can also find national brand outlets in many of the nearby major hotels.I had a higher floor ocean view king accommodation in what appeared to be the newer tower. Room size was listed at 300sf but it did feel smaller with larger dresser, desk, sofa chair, bedding and night tables all in toe. Bathroom was classic 60s micro-tel layout with commode and stall shower in water closet, single vanity behind a curtain wall cutout in the sleeping space. Room furnishings and fixtures were contemporary and in good functional order, but upon closer inspection you will see knicks and bruises from heavy tourist traffic on walls, corner beads, and furniture. Bedding and linen was very good; pillows were below standard; and room cleanliness was somewhere in-between. Personal pet peeves of WiFI, water pressure, and TV were all above standard, especially the flat screen; AC, however, was grossly inadequate, and while not intrusive from a noise perspective, simply could not keep up with the cooling demand, which was hampered by a governor-controlled 68 degree setting too. There is a small refrigerator and after-thought coffee maker in the room but I did not use either in what was a shorter 3 night business junket. Onto the warts supporting the ""3"" score.....1. Room in fact did have a view corridor sight-line peering between the Aston and other structures, but with the hotel planted next to a pack of mid-rise apartments, aging SROs, and budget hostels, water stained roofs and the sonorous-zooshing-echo of air-conditioners abound....so any expectation of scenic beach-scapes with rolling wave tranquility is an oversell. Moreover, with a 28"" wide balcony serving as a lanai and AC docking pad, you will only spend a few moments trying to enjoy the trade winds and moonlight anyways. 2. I would describe the comp breakfast as ""adequate but unremarkable"" with an alternating egg dish and either french toast or waffles every day as the main event, as well as the usual supporting Japanese faves. The real issue is the size of the breakfast breeze-way and its inefficient layout that drives people-frenzy during the morning rushes. There is also 24/7 food option and a bar in the lobby, but the trade winds circulation is blocked on that side and without AC in the space, it had to be almost 90 degrees there, if not hotter....certainly not comfortable enough to sit and enjoy a meal or drink. 3. Lastly, and most denigratingly, this hotel should be called the ""House of Slamming Doors."" At all hours of the day, especially the morning, you will hear the heavy fire-rated steel doors on every room slamming and in some cases, physically shaking the building structure. I actually don't even think it is intentional, but with the wind vortexes tunneling through the tower envelopes and poorly adjusted door closers, it is way too pervasive and atrociously unnerving. BL-- Rack up the Gold Pass Points for shorter stays of business travel or a quick couples junket at a reasonable price point. The staff is really great, super-courteous, and very aloha-centric too. But the place is just too compact for larger families IMHO, and you will need look elsewhere for a relaxing ocean view, lounge, or resort feel.","San Francisco, California","Joe C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",96,3.0

We trusted the other TripAdvisor reviews and, well, I guess we just got unlucky. They have 2 elevators for 19 floors and one is broken and won't be fixed for at least 2 more weeks. So, it takes (clocked it at 17 minutes yesterday while holding my breakfast tray) forever to get anywhere in this hotel on a good day.Had to stand in dog pee because another patron's large dog got scared in the elevator...Not joking...Guest below us smoking weed so we couldn't sit on our balcony and enjoy the ocean view we're paying for.light in bathroom only turns on if you jiggle the switch.Air-conditioner didn't work when we got here.Guests steal your chair when you leave your table to get sugar for your coffee. People are savages, watch out, always have one person at your table. lol. I had contacted the hotel before arrival and asked if there was anything we could do for my daughters birthday at the hotel and was told they'd give her a complimentary cupcake and card delivered to our room. That never happened. They wouldn't accept our TLA form. We've had our car in valet for 10 days and at $30 a day it's not worth it. We were told they had self parking, but when we arrived they told us, that's not available, so we were forced to valet and they don't have enough valet and they take forever. 24 minutes this morning and it wasn't busy. They also are only nice to certain people and open doors for certain people. Valet treated us like crap. The pool is tiny and in a wind vortex between several buildings on the 3rd floor where breakfast is also served. Be prepared to get rained on, hold everything down, have birds in your food and bring a sun visor while you eat.The only good things about this hotel are the breakfast staff that work their tail off and people, please put your dishes away, they aren't waiters and this isn't a restaurant so don't treat them like crap and our housekeeping lady, she was awesome sauce! If you want a hotel that really takes care of you, go to the Outrigger Reef on the Beach!! They are AWESOME!! We stayed with them for 10 days also and they were AMAZING! This place, not so much.

This was my first time staying at this property. They upgraded me to a nicer room without asking, which was a great welcome gift. The hotel is located on the west end of Waikiki, about a block or so from the Honolulu zoo. There are plenty of restaurants and eateries around there. The staff was great -- very attentive and helpful. From the front desk, to the valet, to the housekeeping staff they were all first class. The room was very clean. I never had to call the front desk because the housekeeper forgot to replenish towels. I use the ice bucket, and she was nice enough to clean and dry it daily and provide a new liner. The complimentary breakfast is a full-up breakfast buffet. Hot breakfast sandwiches, oatmeal, eggs, juices, yogurts, fruits -- as well as some Asian congee (rice porridge), diced tofu, and kimchee -- were readily available. Hot coffee and tea as well. While the food is under cover, the eating area is poolside with umbrellas, so maybe there are some issues during a rainy season. The hotel has a decent gym with a number of aerobic machines (treadmills, bikes, etc.) as well as some benches and a full set of dumbbells. I would have rated this 5 stars, but there were two reasons that kept me from doing that. Reason Number One: The elevator. There are two elevators for each of the two towers. The hotel is 19 stories high (I was on the 17th floor), so you're waiting, and waiting, and waiting. On the plus side, the hotel realizes this and publishes a notice of peak elevator times so you can plan accordingly. I noticed that the staff has to use the same elevators, so there probably is no staff elevator to move large carts and the like. Reason Number Two: On-site parking. It's limited. When I couldn't get in the first day, the very polite valet directed me to a garage across the street at the Banyan Tree Resort. That worked out okay, but they only take cash and it is day-by-day. This is the first hotel of many in Waikiki that I experienced this, so I mention it as significant. Having said that, the Banyan Tree parking was fine. Monitored by security and safe. So if you know this going in, it is not such a big deal. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay at Hyatt Place in Waikiki and it is on my list of solid properties when I need to travel there again.

Part of the deal was my willingness to accept a ""handicapped accessible"" room on the 5th floor. The room was fine and the walk in shower and extra large bathroom areas were an added benefit from my perspective. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the furnishing were all in good order (including corner couch).I did not avail myself of the free breakfasts as I was out very early each day. Don't come here for the (small) pool and also be prepared for a potential group influx. For two of the days I was there a large group of rowdy adolescents from Australia and New Zealand interested water sports adventures clogged the lobby areas (sometimes lounging on the floors). The hotel staff showed no initiative in asking the teens to unclutter walk-through areas or behave in a less rowdy manner. Fortunately, there were gone by the 2nd day of my stay and the nois did not go upstairs to the sleeping rooms.That said, the staff members were friendly and helpful, the free WIFI worked well.

The hotel was near full capacity one night, and very busy but the service in the bar area was almost non-existent one night, the staff were busy checking people in, preparing food, people including myself got up and walked out.

I've stayed at Hyatt Place MD, Kansas, and OR and truly enjoyed consistent quality of service Hyatt Place is known for. Recently, I was in Hawaii for medical reasons and stayed at Hyatt Place Waikiki for ten days. Valet service was fast, quick, and efficient. Although I checked-in without any delay, the front desk staff failed to explain to me how the new Hyatt electronic key system works. Just as I expected, my room was spacious, clean, and equipped with all the standard room amenities of a Hyatt Pace. Room is unusually warm, even with the AC set at 68 degrees. Housekeeping staff, Geraldine Stevenson is excellent -- she is fast, efficient, and follows the standards of cleaning. Thus, it was a problem when she was off as the other two are not as good as she was. Because of my surgery, I was cooped up in my room and had no choice but to order room service . The quality of service and food are hit and miss and portions are not standardized. Breakfast items on the 3F are good if you're only staying for 3 days, but if you're staying for 10 days -- you will be eating the same items over and over again. Worse, the cook does not know how to make a good pot of rice! The night prior to my departure and for some odd reason, two gentlemen in suits were checking into my room. Fortunately, my door was double-locked. I called the front desk and told them what was happening. They never called me back to offer any explanation.",guam,"vickys271</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>guam</strong>",4,2.0

The room was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed at in my life and that is a big statement as I have stayed at hundreds. You literally had to walk sideways to get around to dodge your suitcase or family members. The sofa fold out bed was so small that our 6 year old daughter could not comfortably fit on it so she stayed in our bed. Our room (on the top floor with ocean views) was so small that my wife and I (and our daughter) were actually laughing about it like crazy people. The pool area were they provide the free breakfast is old and dirty. This hotel may suit many people and under normal circumstances I would have never booked it so I don't want to get too critical as I know that not everyone can stay at 5 star hotels.

We brought it to their attention and they admitted it was their fault. We had a police report filed and they promised to take care of the problem (filing insurance) but we had to keep calling them over and over to get anything done. We finally contacted our travel agent and he called the manager who assured us the problem would be taken care of. Well needless to say two weeks later after we were back home we got a notice in the mail from the rental car company. More phone calls!! Hopefully the problem will be handled now but who knows.

There are many places to sit and eat although later in the morning bigger groups may find it difficult to get a table. I personally had no trouble finding a table for two at any time of the morning.

Every staff member I encountered during my week-long stay was very friendly. I love that the entrance to the hotel is wide open, but it's secure since you need to use your room key to get to any of the guest floors. The poolside complimentary breakfast was great and even when a downpour occurred one day, someone was out quickly to wipe down tables and chairs as soon as it stopped.We were lucky to be placed on the PH level (really just the 20th floor) so we had an amazing view. While the view was great, that meant extra time in the elevators. There are two elevators for the 20-floor tower right by the front desk, which staff also shares (think - housekeeping cart takes up at least 1/2 the elevator). They are very slow, make many stops, and are often very crowded. Heading up and down, there were several instances where no one else could get on as it was already uncomfortably full. Plan ahead for a long elevator wait/ride if you're trying to get somewhere on time. Seriously. I still give the hotel an excellent rating as this certainly did not ruin my trip, but I think if enough people complain about this, they may consider adding another much needed shaft (if the space even permits?)","San Diego, California","lihawkin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",2,5.0

Buses, limos, and cars lined the street and valet area making drop-offs and pick-ups slow. Unlike most hotels, there is no valet number to call for your car. The ticket tells you to use an app to request your car. The app doesn't work (and the valets acknowledged it hasn't for a while).On the positive side, the in-room internet was fast and free.

The line to check in was so long that I understood why the driveway was backed up. Even the hotel parking garage was full, so I had to shuttle my car around parking spots and feed the meters until 6pm. We waited forever for elevators, and there were so many people in the swimming pool that evening that we went back to the room, put on our clothes, and just left for dinner. We were very apprehensive about a free breakfast being offered at a hotel like this, but were pleasantly surprised that the crowds were handled well. I'm not sure what to say to fix the traffic problem in this hotel, except to fir the architect that designed it.

Not your 'all you can eat' high end hotel breakfast buffet wit everything but for the price of the room it's a great inclusion and caters to all.

Breakfast was below average sorry to say there's so much you can do.2. At the bar there's no staff. I ordered some food and the bar staff is also the cook, so when he/she is cooking no bar staff.3. The food menu is below average you have a busy hotel but everyone seems to be going out for a meal, keep them in, don't serve fries and asked for a pizza and no dough.4. My wife is a vegetarian all the places we go to from Europe, New York, Chicago, LA, Las Vegas, Texas everyone does vegetarian burger.

I've seen a trend of big-chain, lower-level properties taking over older properties in Waikiki and making them their own. Since they are not ""new"" builds, you are dealing with the various idiosyncrasies of the older buildings.Hyatt acquired the Ocean Resort Hotel at the east end of Waikiki and converted it into a Hyatt Place. I can always use Hyatt points and the Hyatt Regency was priced way beyond my pay grade. So, Hyatt Place it is. Approaching the property by car is a bit tricky. The vehicle entrance is off of one-way Paoakalani Ave. Don't drive on Kuhio to get to it; use Kalakaua Ave, make a left on Paoakalani and the Hyatt is in the last block on the right. The driveway exits onto Kuhio. It is a short narrow driveway that can be crowded with taxis, valet vehicles and service vehicles. The valet staff does an efficient job of moving cars into the driveway. Valet parking is $30 per day. There is self-serve parking at an independent garage in the next block up for a lesser daily fee.Hyatt Places are fairly minimal service operations. The ""hosts"" run the desk and serve food off the 24-hour menu, as well as tend bar. I received good service from them during my stay. Unlike mainland locations, this Hyatt Place also contained a concierge and tour desk, as well as a couple of well-stocked gift/curio shops. The friendly proprietors of those shops are not afraid to bargain in order to make a sale so you might not have to venture over to Duke's Lane to pick up a Hawaiian shirt or souvenir.The hotel has a modern feel in furnishings and carpeting that is found in all Hyatt Places. However, the layout of this hotel is far different than the cookie-cutter mini-suite rooms in mainland Hyatt Places.The rooms can be fairly large or really small. My 11th Floor even-numbered room was tiny, with a dinky little balcony occupied by the room's air conditioning system. It was reasonably clean, with a large shower and lots of hot water. There is a refrigerator, coffee maker and room safe. The bathroom vanity area was really small. Few hooks to hang things on, and very little space to place my toiletries on.Note that most even-numbered rooms give you a partial mountain view, and overlook busy and noisy Kuhio Ave. The noise from city buses and other traffic could be heard at the higher floors. If you're a light sleeper, consider asking for an odd-numbered room; most don't overlook any street and are a bit quieter. The odd-numbered rooms have either a full or partial ocean view (on a higher floor) or a view of the condo building next door (on a lower floor). If you want a decent view of Waikiki or Diamond Head, you might try for a room at the ends of the higher floors. My room overlooked Kuhio, an elementary school, and a number of shabby apartment buildings below me.The air conditioner in my room was controlled not by the wall-mounted thermostat, but by a hand remote unit which takes some practice to work. Compared with external wall-mounted HVAC units in most Hyatt Places, this unit was reasonably quiet but it was difficult to find a comfortable temperature.Decent-sized desk to work from, adjacent to a set of drawers holding a massive flat-screen TV. The room could have used more light. The room also could have used a decent mattress. My king bed mattress was lumpy and there were cavities at least three inches deep, which made for a less-than restful sleep. I did bring this up with management and received fair compensation. Thanks, Hyatt Place.Your room card key can be read by readers on your room door and in the elevators, where you must swipe the card key against a reader to access guest floors.As with other Hyatt Places, this one offers a free hot breakfast. My choices during my stay were scrambled eggs and sausage, a sort of open-faced breakfast muffin, cinnamon french toast or waffles. There is also fresh fruit, yogurt, hot and cold cereal, pastries and bagels, and the usual selection of specialties for the hotel's Japanese clients.The dining area is the open terrace separating the two towers of the hotel on the 3rd Floor. Breakfast can be an adventure. Doves and other birds dive-bomb diners with abandon and you are encouraged not to leave food unattended on tables. I took two plates with me, one containing breakfast and the other to cover it up while I went for coffee or other items. The terrace can be extremely breezy and not particularly warm. It can be really crowded at breakfast. Each room contains a take-out tray for carrying food back to the room.I did not use the pool or fitness center. There are several computers/work spaces in the lobby and a fairly comfortable lounge.Waikiki Beach is a two-block walk away. The hotel is one of the closer properties to the Honolulu Zoo, Kapiolani Park and Waikiki Aquarium, as well as Diamond Head. Everything else along the Waikiki Beach strip is no more than a 10-15 minute walk. The nearest stop for The Bus is across the street on Kuhio Ave.If you don't care about a view or big-hotel cachet, this Hyatt Place can be an exceptional value. But check the quality of the mattress before you accept the room...",Northern California,"Cyberchomp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northern California</strong>",22,4.0

Upon our arrival and check-in we were upgraded rooms to an oceanview room instead of city just from asking. Matt was the receptionist who checked us in and we both think he really went above and beyond to make our first impression of the hotel the best. We really started off our trip to O'ahu the right way. Matt was really kind, talked to us like we had been friends for a long time, gave us some great ideas on where to go and was overall a really cool person. He helped us with our luggage and in conversation we told him we were in town for work and our 6 month wedding anniversary. After he dropped us off at our room he said he would be back in a few minutes with something for us. We weren't entirely sure what he was going to get but he came back with 2 lava cakes and 2 hawaiian sodas! We were surprised and very excited. Things like that don't happen very often and it might seem small for other people but we were very impressed by Matt's character. Because of him, we will definitely be staying at the Hyatt Place again. Other than Matt's service everyone else was great. There was a hot breakfast served every morning with pancakes, fruit, eggs, oatmeal, granola, yogurt, tea. It was awesome. The hotel wasn't directly on the beach but it was a 2 minute walk. We didn't mind the lack of ocean view because we were barely in the hotel. I think we slept in until 10 one day, the rest we had breakfast and were out by 730. Everyone was friendly and gave us many ideas for where we should visit or get food at. It was a great trip.My only suggestion for the future would be to get softer towels. I understand that could be a huge expense but they were a little rough, especially on sunburned skin.

(We then noticed a sign on the door advising housekeeping that a dog was in the room).While it was not a big issue - the dog did not bark too much, the soundproofing was not enough to block out the noise and if the dog had have been noisier it would have become a real problem.To be honest - while I am a dog lover, if I had known they let dogs in the rooms I may have chosen a different hotel.","Brisbane, Australia","Wayne S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",4,3.0

It's nothing special, but I was comfortable for my three nights. Pros: I scored a huge room with a little lanai (may have been due to my status with Hyatt). No complaints about location, if you're here to Waikiki. Convenient to the Honolulu bus (which is amazing and efficient, btw). The amenities (soap, shampoo, etc.) are decent. There's a gym, a (slightly neglected) pool, and even a laundry room (used the gym; didn't use pool or laundry). There's free breakfast (it was just that, free food; don't book for this alone) and a basic bar on the lobby level. Housekeepers were sweet and friendly. Cons: Elevators are aged and take forever--and this not-tiny hotel was booked up. I thought the lobby furniture (and maybe the bed linens, too) could use a refresh.I stayed in one of the fancier, more expensive properties on the beach as well as a comparably priced ""boutique"" hotel that absolutely sucked, so in all honesty I'd probably give this place another shot if I was looking for space to spread out and the consistency of staying in a Hyatt.","Los Angeles, California","Jon D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",29,4.0

The rooms were so dark I couldn't complete any work and even accessing the bathrooms was nearly impossible in a pitch black room. Only the emergency halway lights were on. I ended up setting up in the hallway to do my work into the night. When I complained because I didn't receive any notice I was offered points to come back and give them an other opportunity. These points took multiple emails of follow up with Ihab their assistant GM back and fourth with him saying it had been processed. When they finally came they were for 1/3 of his promised amount. I couldn't believe it. It all finally was sorted out and I have returned for an other trip. One this most recent trip the whole building was evacuated due to a false fire alarm. After joining the crowd downstairs with no direction on where to go and what was going on I returned to my room.

We quickly learned that these strangers were not joking! You would wait for the elevator for 10-15 minutes! When the hotel has over 16 floors that is just too long of a wait. Also the breakfast space is not in a good location, it is on the pool deck. At peak times the breakfast line will be all the way out of the door and wrapped around the pool deck. There are two entrances to the breakfast area but staff just watches as giant lines form in the one entrance instead of helping direct the chaos.

They did everything they could to make us comfortable and happy. My boyfriend and I arrived at the hotel at 11:30am and we were given 2 choices because our king room was not ready. We could either volunteer to stay for free at Hyatt Regency (2 blocks away) for one night (and some petty cash), or wait 2-3 hours for our room to be ready and it would be on the 2nd or 3rd floor (which according to Trip Advisor is not a good idea). We were exhausted but we chose to do 1 night at Hyatt Regency since it was a total upgrade anyway. I work in the hotel industry, so I understand why overbooking could occur despite management's best ability to avoid that. FYI about the free breakfast: It is extremely crowded, even early in the morning. The food is really not enough to get you started, it's powdered egg, waffles, OJ, the miso soup was bland, and the dining area is kind of dirty (I.E. By the pool that needs scrubbing). The room was decent, however the lights are dim, small stains on the towels and carpet but unnoticeable to the average eye. the trash wasn't changed daily, and the bed is TOO soft. Both my boyfriend and I were sore the 3 nights that we stayed.FYI about the Valet: Call down ahead if you plan to get your car pulled up so you avoid any waiting time. The service was not the best, as some of the older attendants didn't even offer to take the luggage in/out of the car. Free wifi is excellent.We chose Hyatt Place knowing that we wouldn't spend most of the day in the rooms, but seeing how nice the Hyatt Regency was it definitely made a difference in convenience and comfort.","Anaheim, California","Eunice M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anaheim, California</strong>",2,3.0

(We were in Oahu for a friend's son's wedding at an estate on the north shore of Oahu and extended our stay for a vacation.) The facilities are even more than adequate for business travelers as well.In terms of basics, the rooms are very clean, beds are very comfortable, the staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating, and both wireless internet and hot breakfast is included with all rooms. The wireless internet provided excellent bandwidth (typically, 12mbps up and down) and was even suitable for business use (well, even on vacations, some work typically needs to get done).As one would expect in this very urban area, parking is NOT included with the room rate. You can self-park ($25/day if I recall correctly) or valet park for $30/day (charged to your room); I would strongly recommend the valet parking given both the convenience and the relative small difference in price. If you don't have a vehicle, the hotel is amply served by buses, taxis, and shuttles.The “hot breakfast” is a buffet available from 6:30am to 9:30am daily. It is a grade above of what you would expect at a Hampton Inn or similar hotel, but not high cuisine. Food is fresh and continually refreshed. The breakfast area is on the third floor by the pool. Seating is fairly limited though; based on feedback from previous guests, the hotel provides trays in the rooms such that one may bring the breakfast back to consume in your room (although that can be somewhat tricky given the need to use your room's card key to operate the elevator floor selection).Some additional important considerations:The Hyatt Place is in a very urban area with the typical noise accompanying such a location. The hotel is not particularly well sound-insulated. If you are a very “light sleeper” and sensitive to noise, you should bring ear plugs or consider some other hotel. (Both my wife and I were aware of the noise, but had no problems falling asleep and staying asleep through the night!)The Hyatt Place is neither a full service hotel nor a “resort” hotel. Although the hotel does have a 24/7 snack and beverage service, there is no full service restaurant in the hotel itself. And although the hotel has a swimming pool, it is small with very limited seating / lounging areas in its vicinity. However, there are literally hundreds of restaurants ranging from inexpensive fast food / snack bars to some of the best dining in Hawaii within a square mile of the Hyatt Place. Two excellent restaurants (Sansei and DK) are open to the public in the Marriott across the street). And in terms of swimming and other water sports, Waikiki Beach is two short blocks away.That having been said, if you want the amenities and privacy of a “resort,” the Hyatt Place will not meet your needs! There are plenty of “resort hotels” available in Waikiki specifically and in Oahu in general for which you can expect to pay much higher rates and “resort fees.”The only real glitch that we encountered in our 10 day stay was that one of three elevators in the Diamond Head tower of the hotel was inoperable for at least one week and was still broken when we left. That tower with over 250 rooms does not have a service elevator and staff must share the remaining two elevators with guests — long waits for elevators were common during our stay (management's response is that the elevators were from some company in Germany that doesn't stock replacement/service parts in Hawaii!)Also, if you are a hotel loyalty program addict, be aware that the Hyatt Place doesn't offer any “goodies” associate with Platinum or Diamond Gold Passport membership. In our case, there was no “recognition” whatsoever of my Platinum membership. C'est la vie!All in all, we would seriously consider staying at the Hyatt Place again if we travelled to Oahu again and would recommend it to others who need basic, high quality lodging!","Saratoga, California","Dov I</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saratoga, California</strong>",62,4.0

I would unhesitatingly recommend this hotel to families who want a hotel that can accommodate four or five people easily. I checked in quickly and stayed in the taller of the two buildings. Most hotels in Waikiki charge $25 or $30 for a resort fee that includes everything that you don’t need, don’t want, or should be free (e.g., wireless internet, long-distance calls, newspaper). The Hyatt Place doesn’t charge a resort fee, but they still provide outstanding amenities and service. You can get towels to take to Kuhio Beach, which is a block away. They serve a free hot breakfast everyday, starting at 6:30 AM. When I was there, the entrees included scrambled eggs, hotcakes, waffles, and breakfast sandwiches. They also serve miso soup, steamed rice and kim chee, a nice touch. Think of how much breakfast costs in Waikiki: at least $15 to $18 per person. That’s how much you’ll save at the Hyatt Place. Families want room to spread out, and the hotel offers plenty. We were a family of four, and the room came with two queen beds and a sofa bed. The bathroom was good-sized, as well. The room came with a desk for working, a small terrace, and a refrigerator. If you find that you need something, there is an ABC convenience store a few steps away.The hotel is a block from Kalakaua Avenue, the “main drag” in Waikiki. It is adjacent to Kuhio Street, another major street in Waikiki.

It was a last minute trip last year, and our first ever to Hawaii. We loved the open air feel to the lobby and the landscaping. Our room was a mountain view King, and while rather small the view in the morning of the sun and clouds coming over the mountains was breathtaking. And the bed was so exquisitely comfortable any time we sat on it we fell asleep! I loved the water pressure in the shower and the toiletries the housekeeper left were wonderful. Our room attendant by the way was incredible--we would come back to the room to find our leis shaped into a heart on a wooden tray, we would exchange friendly notes, just something special every day. But this is how ALL the staff are. Ciamar at the front desk was so kind and helpful to us our entire stay__I had to hug her goodbye at the end because she felt like family. Breakfast was a highlight every morning__chocolate croissants, fresh fruit, spinach and egg omelettes, oatmeal with cranberries, and the coffee was SO good. The lovely lady (Yuki?) and the gentleman who oversee the breakfasts are so friendly--the gentleman taught me all about Miso soup and what each component was and how to eat it like the Hawaiians do. It is an easy stroll to the beach and you can pick up busses to everywhere really close to the hotel. We took busses to the palace, the shopping mall and the Royal Hawaiian village, and diamond head and hanauma bay for snorkeling. Also we took the trolley one time which was fun. Our last day our flight didn't leave until 8:30 at night. The front desk staff, and again our friend Ciamar, told us we could leave our luggage with them and hang out at the pool or walk on the beach one last time--so we got some beach time, had some lunch,came back to the pool, and freshened up a little. Then we sat in the lobby waiting for our return airport shuttle, and the front desk girls brought us some bottled water! Every single employee we encountered even if it was just in the hallway went out of their way to be friendly and ask how our day was going and where we were from--we were just blown away by the treatment we got and THAT is why we re-booked again this year.

Much people using waikiki hotels complain about the noise of the traffic. Ok you listen a little but nothing that limits your sleeping, believe me i am a bed sleeper, and since long i'vent been sleeping so well like i did in this hotel.From the very wellcome arrival till the departure staff mainly of reception is very friendly, aiming to please you in every sense, helping you whenever needed, giving you informations of all (buses, atractions...) it looks they are trained people, i might consider the staff the jewels of this business.Excelente wifi free, with 6 pc desks and free printer on the ground floor.Excelent and fast room service even the menu is a bit too american .Rooms have good eletronic safe.Breakfast is good even very american standard, i think they could improve a little:scrambled eggs are made by eggs powder, pooridge is not made with milk but water with almost no flavour. But there is always very sweet pineapple and other fruits, good fruit juice not natural , different sorts of bread, some pastries, cereals, coffee and tea and eastern hot food(rice, meat...)I loved Oahu and want to go back to Hawaii in the future, even i leave so far away in Europe, but i definetely will be back in Hyatt Place Waikiki.

It has a small but good lobby, a tiny pool, fitness center. The value is unbeatable because it includes breakfast and towel service which is very handy and with no resort fee which can be up to 50 usd per night on some hotels!.

It can get crowdy at some hours though.They serve Starbucks coffee in the Lobby cafeteria.The Hyatt Place is located at the end of the Waikiki strip one block of the beach. Walking distance to everything although if you want to go to one of the best beaches in Waikiki, Kahanamoku Beach, its 20 - 30 minutes walking. (is the beach in front of the Hilton). The room was super clean, I asked for a crib for my baby and they gave me one quickly and was comfortable. The bed was so comfy!!!, awesome mattress. Bathroom was super small though, the shower was very uncomfortable. The room is fully equipped with a tea/coffee maker, an empty fridge so you can put your food, and the AC worked good. There is only valet parking for 30 usd per night but you can park across the street for 20. We stayed in a room in the Diamond Head tower, and had no problems with slow elevators. (Always saw lines of people waiting in the other tower waiting for the elevator).This is not a ""resort"", it doesn't have that feel. It is more quiet, laid back, small and not inviting pool, etc... But I spend a lot of time in the beach in front of the Sheraton and Hilton and is so noisy and tons of people that I preferred my hotel in the end of the day.Overall I would recommend this hotel.

Easy access to beach and transit, walking distance to shopping, bars and restaurants along Kalakaua Ave. Similar to other Hyatt Place locations, this hotels offers great value for the money and includes free breakfast.We had only 3 minor complaints during our stay: 1) slow elevators; 2) traffic noise; and 3) parking. The hotel is comprised of 2 high rise towers, the Diamond Head and Pali towers. If you have a choice of rooms, I would suggest the Diamond Head tower because it has 3 elevators, and further away from Paoakalani Ave and Kuhio Ave which are noisy with bus traffic. If you are unlucky enough to stay in the Pali tower, be prepared for long waits at the elevator, especially during high traffic times like breakfast and check-in. Really odd that the tallest tower has only 2 elevators. If you have a rental car, parking can be expensive and difficult to find too. When we first arrived, Hyatt valet $30 parking was full, so we ended up parking accross the street at the Waikiki Banyon for $20/day. However, I soon discovered that you could park 2 blocks away for free during the evenings and weekends along Kapahulu Ave (across from the Zoo). Alternatively, the City pay lot at the Zoo is $1/hour or $24 for the day.Notwithstanding the 3 minor complaints we had with our stay, overall I would recommend this hotel.

The hotel is about two blocks back from the beach and is at the end of Waikiki, close to the zoo. However, nowhere is really far from anywhere in Waikiki and the hotels and shops are a lot closer together than it appears on the maps. The bus stop is just over the road and we caught buses every day, so it was very convenient.I was travelling with a work colleague/friend so we wanted a bit of space and two double beds. The hotel itself outside and in the foyer looks a little tired, but we had absolutely no complaints at all. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a suite which had two very comfortable double beds, a large living area, big flat screen TV and overall plenty of room. It was great. The staff were friendly and seemed helpful for those who needed it. The pool area is only average, a concreted area on the 3rd floor, but it was OK and had plenty of deck chairs for getting some sun. Breakfast was included and this was served each morning on an outside terrace which was quite pleasant, however I'm not sure what would happen on rainy days.The breakfast food was pretty average. Powdered egg patties on non-toasted muffins with plastic cheese was the only protein option, alongside highly sugared cereals and toast, Danish pastries and some fresh melon and pineapple etc. As Australians, we find the super highly sugared cereals and sweet bread really hard to cope with and would have been happy to pay a little extra for some more protein choices like bacon and eggs. However, for those who like their carbs, it was probably fine. We ended up walking to the esplanade and having brekky at one of the cafe's which was great.The rooms were serviced promptly every morning. We didn't end up using the gym so I can't give any sort of review, but overall, we had a great stay and really can't say anything bad about the place.","Horsham, Australia","Courtcase</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Horsham, Australia</strong>",31,4.0

My room was on the 14th floor. There was a large balcony. The weather was mild (mid-70s) so it was a nice place to hang out, although I can see where it might be too hot at other times of the year. (The picture was taken from the balcony). If you really want scenic views, this isn't the hotel for you; it is surrounded by taller buildings. You mostly get peekaboo views of water and mountains as you look between the other hotels.Waikiki beach was just a block away, as was the main tourist thoroughfare with high-end shops, fast food places such as McDonald's and Burger King, and about a gazillion ABC stores. (ABC stores are convenience stores that cater to tourists; they are everywhere in Honolulu, including right next to the hotel AND at the end of the block). Hyatt Place will supply beach towels at no extra cost if you ask at the counter.The service was great, and there were some unexpected perks I didn't expect. For example, there was a free lei-making class that I stumbled across in the lobby, so although the hotel doesn't supply a lei when you arrive, you can make your own!The provided breakfast is very basic with standard mainland fare such as waffles and scrambled eggs, although it did have miso soup for a little variety. I was sorry not to see any papaya juice or pineapple juice, however; I would have liked some island flavor.Honolulu is a big city with big city traffic, which means street noise at all hours. Normally I would run the fan to cancel out the noise; however, the wall-mounted A/C unit didn't seem to have a 'run fan' option. It was a type that I wasn't used to, so it may have been my own ignorance. The room had a comfortable King-sized bed with a small toilet and a shower stall that included a retractable clothes line for hanging bathing suits, which proved very useful.Check in and out was easy, plus the young man who checked me in saw me in the lobby and greeted me by name the next day. Did I remember his name? I did not; that's why it impressed me!I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again.

They also don't have enough parking, forcing to you to pay high fees for valet or use the parking structure that is catty-corner from the hotel. So be prepared to shell out extra money for that. Also, be careful with the valet. First time we dropped off a brand new car with 15 miles on it, they tired to say that the trunk was dented and scratched. Completely untrue. I felt they were trying to mark the car because of how they have to park multiple cares so close together that they were trying to cover themselves if something did happen. And when we questioned them about it and had them bring the car out to show us the damage. When we should them there was no damage they just said oh it must have been a mistake. We are so use to seeing scratches and dents on the back of vehicles because of the way people handle their luggage. Not sure I buy that.

Now, my primary chain of choice is Marriott, which I hold elite status with. But I like Hyatt too and have status with them as well. The price of the Hyatt Place was comparable to the Courtyard Waikiki, but the Hyatt Place comes with free breakfast and slightly cheaper parking, so we decided to give it a try.We arrived at about 8pm, so there was little traffic heading into the hotel. The valets helped us immediately and even asked (I'm guessing since we were dressed in business attire and since we're local) what time we'd like to have our car in the morning and they'd have it out by then! At check-in, the staff greeted us warmly, acknowledge our status, and proactively offered an upgrade. For this stay, we were assigned room 1739; a deluxe king room with a city view. Now, I'm not on vacation, so I could really care less what the view is. I do appreciate the high-floor, which helps cut down on street noise, though the elevators are fairly slow... and there's only 2 of them (at least for the main tower). When we hauled our tired bodies to our room, we were pleasantly surprised to find a rather large room with a nice sofa, a large safe, generous storage space, a large mini fridge, a 42"" HDTV, a cozy work desk, and a plush king bed. The bathroom is a little small, but is functional and isn't claustrophobic like some other Waikiki properties. The a/c was a little noisy for my liking, but definitely not the worst I've experience, nor was it that much of a bother. The water pressure in the shower could have been better, but again, not a deal killer. Unlike many other similar limited service hotels, the Hyatt Place has a 24/7 pickup dining option. The menu isn't HUGE like at some full service hotels, but it has a nice decent selection and the food was of surprisingly good quality/taste (especially compared to Courtyard by Marriott's Bistro concept) and value! The wife ordered the soup + half chicken caesar salad, while I ordered a bacon cheddar burger with fruit (choice of fruit or chips). My burger actually ended up coming with both (score!), but the burger itself filled me up and I took the fruit with me to work the next day. The wife liked her meal as well, though the half salad actually looked like a full size! On our second day, we got out of the hotel quickly, but had to skip breakfast since it starts at 6:30 and we needed to get to work! Upon return later that evening, however, the porte-cochere was jam packed and we ended up waiting almost 15 minutes to drive up. It took valet another 10 minutes to get our car to their garage. A similar issue arose on our final day when we left mid-morning (I took off from work), with a bit of a wait to get our car. I don't blame the valets for this; I simply think they're overwhelmed. The final day we did get to the breakfast too, which consisted of link sausage, scrambled eggs, french toast, several varieties of cereals and baked goods, yogurt, cottage cheese, oatmeal, assorted pastries, toast, fruit, rice, miso soup, juice, milk, coffee, and tea. It was a nice spread for a free meal for sure! So if I ever have a need to stay at a hotel again or simply want a staycation, I wouldn't hesitate to return to the Hyatt Place Waikiki. I think it's one of the best deals around with good quality and value. It certainly ranks high on my list!","Honolulu, Hawaii","kharada46</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",42,4.0

However, the building which was clearly not designed as a Hyatt makes the overall experience stressful. The elevators are a primary complaint if you are staying in the first tower, it takes at least 7 minutes to catch one and they do not have a service elevator for the staff. If you attempt to get on the elevator when cleaning staff is coming on shift, forget it, they pull their carts on and make it impossible to load. That coupled with the fact the primary clients are large families-- the elevator experience, crowds and time lapses make this a hotel to stay at only if you are not in Hawaii for enjoyment, or have zero interest in the Hotel.",,stephaniecr2016,0,3.0

Comparing Hyatt Place Waikiki to other hotels in Waikiki, we found this to be an excellent choice for us, a young family of 5. Here's why: 1) 2 blocks from the beach - specifically the part of the beach that has been made into an artificial lagoon which makes it perfect for young kids who don't necessarily know how to swim. 2) Walking distance to almost everything you need which eliminates the need for a car rental. 3) Hot breakfast every day on the rooftop patio - aside from eliminating the cost of a breakfast at a restaurant, it also has the benefit of not needing to leave the hotel to have that breakfast. Our routine for the weeks that we stayed here was to wake up, go down to the roof patio have breakfast, go back to our room and get ready for the day's activities. 4) Clean, modern hotel - many Waikiki hotels are old and show their age (pastel colours, limited wifi access, odd room layouts, etc.). We found Hyatt place to have modern clean decor, good wifi access, modern TV which allowed us to hook up our camera's to see the photos we had taken and our room was spacious enough to fit our family - 2 queen beds, and plenty of floor space for the crib. The staff are friendly and helpful and they go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay. All in all, this hotel was a big part of the reason we enjoy Hawaii so much.

The hotel promptly replied that they would try and give us an early check In and advised that we could use all the Hotels amenities until our room became available. So on our early arrival at the Hotel unfortunately our room was not ready. The receptionist (Jade) was very curt when I asked to use the Hotels amenities and told me that I should have booked the previous night stay if I wanted todo that. She was most unhelpful and unfriendly and had it been just me & my husband traveling we would have left and tried another hotel. it's not like you are short of choice for accommodation in Waikiki. However as we had our children with us who were tired from the over night flight we decided to wait. Jade didnt take our phone number in order to call us when the room was ready, she just told us to come back in a few hours to check if our room was ready. So we did and were able to get into our room a couple of hours early. The room was a good size but it was at the front corner of the hotel and very noisy from the traffic. The air conditioning was also incredibly loud. Next morning I decided to see if there would be another room. This time I was served by Matt who was absolutely fantastic. He Arranged for us to be shifted to the other tower. The room was much smaller but quieter so we all got a good sleep. Thanks Matt you restored our faith in reception staff! Our housekeeper was Lani, she was very particular with how she left our room and we noticed the difference in the housekeeping standard when she had her days off. The rest of our stay was great. The Hotel is right on the bus route and it's easy to walk to most places. The breakfast area is quite small and it was hard to get a table at times but the menu had something for everyone. The Hotel is near the Zoo, and the beach area there is great for kids.

Hyatt Place had everything we needed and more. I booked us in this hotel because I was attending a conference. My fiancé and I planned to move to the Hyatt Regency after the conference. We were so pleased with our experience, we stayed at Hyatt Place. I arrived a day before my fiancé, and Lynn (at the front desk) was friendly, efficient, and extremely helpful. She allowed me to check in a bit early. Every person I interacted with at Hyatt Place was gracious, kind, helpful, and full of smiles. The room on the 11th floor was spacious and clean. It had a king sized bed, a sleeper-sofa, desk, small chest of drawers, a mini fridge, and a lanai with an incredible view of Diamond Head. When I stay at any hotel/resort, I look for amenities that make my trip smoother. Hyatt Place hit my entire checklist. 1. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Pillows were the perfect density. 2. The cooling unit was quiet. I slept well every night in our room, a rare experience for me when I travel. 3. Great bathroom. The shower head had multiple settings. There was a retractable clothesline in the shower. The bath products were effective and had a pleasant, gender-neutral scent. 4. The lanai was big enough for two people to relax on while having breakfast. We watched the sunrise from our lanai. beautiful! 5. The mini-fridge was big enough for drinks and snacks. 6. Room had large, easy-to-use safe. Outside the room, I was very pleased with special touches Hyatt Place offered its guests. The daily breakfast included eggs dishes, bread products, fresh fruit, cottage cheese, yogurt, cereal, rice, miso soup, and more. We often used the tray from our room to take food upstairs to eat on our lanai. The gym was exceptional for a hotel. It had quite a few cardio machines, a dumbbell rack, yoga mats, disposable ear buds, clean towels, and antibacterial wipes (a big deal for this gym rat). I used the gym nearly every day. Hyatt Place is one block from the beach and the zoo. It is close to stores (ABC!!) restaurants, and nightclubs. We walked everywhere. One day we rented a car to go to the north shore. We parked the car across the street. It was easy and affordable to park for the night. The closest beach had surfboard and umbrella rentals.After several days, Hyatt Place felt like home. It is not a resort, but it provides comfort, amenities, and amazing hospitality. During our stay, we interacted a lot with Lynn. She answered all our questions and took genuine interest in us. She was truly the gem of Hyatt Place, and we look forward to seeing her next year.

The hotel was just off the main strip, at the top end and was in a fairly quite area. The rooms where very spacious, and where cleaned every day to a high standard. Breakfast was a massive let down, and was completely bog standard, with little variety. Having booked into the hotel for 2 weeks, after the first few days we opted to have breakfast else where. The breakfast area was kind of small, though we never waited more than a few minutes for a table to become available on the days we did head down. We did have to wait for the lifts on a few occasions, during peak times, (breakfast ect), but never over long.The swimming pool seemed to be an after thought, and was so small for the size of the hotel.

This vacation was a just a vacation with no third party evaluations outside of you, a potential guest. Stayed at the Hyatt Place in late December, early January. This was our families second stay at a Hyatt Place, the first being in Orlado Florida.So why would a guest want to stay here over the many other choices on the island?As this hotel has someone that reads and replies to reviews, lets start with the ugly which has an easy fix. There is a door that is between the third floor elevators and entrance to the breakfast area and pool. On the inside of the door is an enormous amount of built up finger prints and dried dude that may be dried food. The outside handle also has food on it. Guests push on this door to get breakfast. This door is no doubt crawling with germs and potential pathegins. It has been this way for the seven days that I have been here. On behalf of all present and future guests, have someone thoroughly clean it. Tip for guests at any hotel. The tv remote can often be the dirtiest item in a room, ever more germs than a toilet seat. I bring wipes with me and clean it thoroughly before using, regardless which hotel I stay at. Here the remote had dust, hair and crude on it. The lobby, spacious, lots of room for guests and visitors to sit and relax. There is work area with computers and a printer. Computers do not allow downloads. Thus some boarding passes that require downloads can't be printed.The lobby has a Starbucks, $5 for a muffin, ouch.Staff are friendly and there appears to be a layer of security. We often had staff come into the elevators with us.The elevators can have some wait time, average for us was 3 minutes. Many times a lot quicker and only once about 7 minutes. The lobby and elevators, floors were vary clean. The goodThis hotel is clean and convenient. Rooms are spacious and it is a short walk to the beach, ABC store and many restaurants. The Zoo and Aquarium are about ten to fifteen minutes, beach about five minutes, restaurants like the Cheese Cake Factory about fifteen minutes. The Marriot just across the street has a very good Italian restaurant and there is a Burger King, McDonald's within ten minutes. Parking here is $30 a night or kitty corner from the Hyatt is a parking lot inside the banyan hotel for $20 a night. There are car rentals, budget or hertz at the Hyatt Regency, about three blocks away. Book ahead of time as cars are often sold out.The really good. Unfortunately this hotels puts added pressure on you buy not having a charge for breakfast and no resort fee. Now you have the added burden of how to spend all the extra money you have. Typically resort fees can be between $25 and $35 or more per night at other hotels. On a seven day vacation thats an average of $210 extra that this hotel doesn't charge.Breakfasts at McDonald's can be about $10 a person, buffets at hotels over $20 a person, in a week breakfasts for family stay at other hotels can overage $400 plus taxes, at the Hyatt Place $0. So you have an extra $700 in your wallet by staying here.Breakfast buffet. Varies by the day, at least four food items for the Asian diet including soup, tofu, greens and more. Other dishes include hot and cold cereals, some mornings bacon and eggs, have and eggs, waffles, pancakes, toast, bagels, fruit , mostly fresh pineapple. Coffee, tea, juice, not freshly squeezed. Lots of places to sit including get a few places around the pool, an open air area and a small covered area. Birds. Any open area has them. There aren't many I counted 8 sparrows and 2 pigeons. There are signs on every table to not feed them, but kids do. If you do not want birds while you eat ( be thankful there aren't mosquitoes) sit in the covered area, get here before 7 am or bring a tray from your room, load it up and take it back to your room or the downstairs lobby. There are no chefs to individually cook omlets, no freshly squeezed juices but lots to fill you up for a wonderful day in Hawaii. Pool. Smaller, perhaps 5 ft deep. Has a lift to lower handicapped into it. Clean Security. You need a room key to operate the elevators. There are a number of staff in the lobby area as well as the desk for parking. Each room has a safe. This appears to be a safe place to stay.People that stay here, multicultural, I met guests from Japan, India, other areas of Asia, USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, New Zealand and other areas of HawaiiGuests feel there is value in this hotelThe bad, I paid for an ocean view with a king sized bed. I got two queens and a partial ocean view or what might better be described as an ocean glimps.

The building is old and has been converted/ renovated. It's evident in the ceilings, balconys, doors etc. I liked the open Hawaiian feel of the building over their Mainland type properties. We've stayed in heaps of Hyatt Place locations, and the room was as expected. Big issue I had is there was no self serve laundry on site, instead asking $19 to wash & iron a dress. $3.75 for under garments. Seriously? This is not the 5 star Hyatt brand, but their budget 3 star version. Prices are unrealistic. I also paid $5 for a ginger beer. Whoa, it's a soft drink guys. Happy Hour prices were expensive- $7 for a real beer... Their Gallery Host menu is also more expensive than the Mainland, but not by much.Breakfast time was busy but I took the tray from my room and returned there to eat. The beach is a block away and you can grab a towel before heading down. Wifi was pretty good and the computers in the lobby are password protected.We arranged a taxi with them for pickup to the airport. It would only be value ($29 + tip) in busy times. For a 6am pickup it took 15 mins and Uber would have been way cheaper. It cost us $7 via Uber to get to the Mall.Generally a well located comfortable stay. It's nice and quiet down this end but for a few days around Thanksgiving we found food options very limited. ",Australia,"lost_nomads</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",371,4.0

As such, I was upgraded to a room on the top floor with an ""ocean view."" That was appreciated. Although another hotel blocks your central view of the ocean, you can see the ocean. The room was clean and comes with a mini fridge. The daily breakfast was delicious and had cold choices as well as sausage and eggs. The free Wi-Fi was an added plus and worked quite well. Food Pantry is a brief walk up Kuhio Boulevard, and the beach is a block away. I considered going to the Honolulu Zoo, but many of the exhibits were closed from what was posted on their entrance sign, and for $14.00 a person, I decided to skip it. (Besides, I had been there previously, and it is very, very tiny, so with exhibits missing, it did not seem worth the time or fee.) Anyway, I digress. My room air conditioning unit made a sound like a combination between pouring rain, high winds coming through a cracked open window, and a jet reversing its engines on landing. All three sounds are accurate in that it cycled through the sounds, mostly at high volume. I went down to the front desk after enduring two nights of the noises, ( I would have gone sooner, but I did not want to appear ungrateful for the ""room upgrade."") I was offered a change of rooms. I explained that this was very inconvienant since I had my belongings all settled in and spread throughout the closets, dresser drawers, etc. They sent up a maintence man who told me to put the unit on low (quiet) and keep the fan running continusously, not on auto. When the noise continued, and the room got stuffy, I visited the front desk again. The noise had now kept waking me up for three nights. This time, the maintenance man gave me some sort of remote control to try different settings. It made no difference. I expected more from Hyatt. Upon checkout, the agent asked me how my stay was, and when I told him about my experience, he said he would give me 10,000 Hyatt points for my trouble... big deal. I expect more from a Hyatt. I sent a message to Hyatt, and never got a reply. I took two videos of the A/C unit making the terrible noises.","Overland Park, Kansas","MikeGreek</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Overland Park, Kansas</strong>",75,2.0

Let me also say our rooms were comped from a charity auction, so it's hard for me to make a value comparison. I will say that the booking process was a little complex due to the charity auction (no fault of Hyatt) but Jade in reservations was so very helpful and thorough with us. The hotel is clean, the rooms are decent, and the staff is really friendly and helpful. Just don't expect a resort experience with an outdoor bar on the beach. There is a small pool, but it's surrounded by a lot of tall buildings. They serve breakfast, but I really wouldn't say there's a restaurant on the property. Although they say there is self-parking, it was always booked up for the four days we were there. You can valet, or park in an independent garage across the street. That garage was kind of a pain as you had to pay $18 each day and then you only got 24 hours (to the minute) after you paid, So you ended up scheduling your day around it. Again, I realize this was not a Hyatt operation, but it's where they point you if you don't want to valet. Overall I would say the Hyatt Place is a good choice if you are on a budget.","Washington, DC","pcourt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, DC</strong>",54,4.0

The rooms are clean with good linen, decor, tv connectivity and good wi-fi signal. The hotel also offers a free service to print documents. No bath but a serviceable shower stall that is a bit dated. I had a city view room. I was satisfied with the room and the cleaning staff were very friendly and patient when I left the room late so they could clean the room. There are safes, ironing board an iron in the rooms also. A/C worked well. The breakfast area is on the third floor beside the small pool and gym facilities. For me the breakfast could do with improvement. Sliced breads and 2 types of bagels supplied with packaged cream cheese, peanut butter or jams, no wholemeal/grained breads. Fruit salad with pineapple and melon, could be improved by a selection of whole fresh fruit. Cold meats & cheeses would have also improved selection. I do not eat pork so the 'hot' offering was limited to pre-made scrambled eggs that was not very hot, there were pre-made waffles but I did not try them as guests were using serving implements that touched pork to serve themselves. Fruit juices, yogurt, cottage cheese also provided. With my food taboos (pork in particular) breakfast was limited. Miso was provided for the Japanese guests. The dining area was very windy in the mornings so this could be a challenge. The reception staff were very helpful and can arrange transport to the airport at a fixed rate of $29 through Charley's Taxis. The tour desk staff are extremely helpful and knowledgeable and a good resource and can provide a map of the area. The carpeted hallways where the rooms are make it quite difficult to draw luggage arround that has wheels. Location is excellent and on the route of the Waikiki trolley bus route and a stone throw away from Waikiki beach. I felt very safe here.

I really didnt know what to expect but I must say I was absolutely relieved once we arrived here. From the moment we arrived after a long flight, we were greeted by the most accomodating staff. Our room was not ready yet so we passed the time with out first Mai Tai at the Tiki's bar and grill across the street from the beach. We were tired but excited to start our first real vacation together. A short time later our room was ready and we eagerly went upstairs. Walking in, I was very suprised by the modern, clean, and great view of the ocean even from a block away. Keep in mind we were on the 12th floor. We thought that the A/C was broken and called the front desk. I'm telling you they were at our door before we hung the phone up. The service guy was friendly and knew just what to do. The A/C Switch at the unit had simply been switched off at the unit. Cold air in minutes after the call. The next day my lady called for a few supplies, soaps and shampoos etc. and again it was less than 5 minutes before a friendly belhop was at the door with a bag of supplies. In short, the service was undoubtedly outstanding. The room was clean, smelled fresh, had clean modern linens and the bed was a pillow top and was like sleeping on a cloud. Large 55 in LCD tv in the rooms too. I cant say enough about the room. We did enjoy happy hour a couple times between 4 and 7 when Nadine served us perfect Mai Tai's until our faces went numb! Ask for Nadine, you wont be dissapointed. The Hotel is in a great location in Wakiki and easy walking distance to the beaches and dining. Parking??? Ok guys listen up. We did not pay for parking our entire trip! Here is how we did it. The hotel charges $30 bucks a day to park the car. DO NOT DO IT! The metered parking on the streets is free every day from 6pm to 7am. We would park the car in from of the hotel on Paoakalani Ave, Ohua Ave or Kapahulu Ave every day after 6pm. You just need to have patience and drive that circle a bit and you'll no doubt find a spot every day. Then every morning at 630 am, my lady and I woke up to go move the car to the Wakiki shell free parking lot. you can park there all day until midnight!!. Do this daily and I promise you'll love the early walk and grab a free coffee in the lobby on your way out! Sounds like a pain in the rear, but trust us, you'll love not paying for parking and you'll be up early for a wonderful breakfast on the 3rd floor every day. So that brings us to the free breakfast. This hotel has a great free breakfast every day on the pool deck patio in the fresh open Hawaiian air. They served eggs, bacon, sausage, all the fruit you coul want, yogurts Pancakes and french toast, oatmeal, bagles and cream cheese as well as an assortment of great apple croissants, fruit juices and coffee. A very healthy breakst but good. A beautiful way to wake up in the morning. This hotel was an absolute delight to stay at. We enjoyed every bit of our stay and the staff took good care of us, even offering us two unbrellas free of charge to use during our stay for the occasional showers. The pool was not even used by us but there is a small, clean pool. Not Hottub though. No matter because you can simply go to one of the beachfront hotels and sit in the hottubs there as we did! We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good location without spending a fortune.

I had stayed previously over the years at many other establishments but all had a side sea view, not full on.I was attracted to the Hyatt option but sadly it did not fulfil my entire expectations. Although the room was high level it had very broken outlook. The sales image on the website is deceptive and I found I was in fact some 3 blocks back from the beach, and the water view was sandwiched between some 3 high rise buildings in the foreground. The only real advantage was that I had the late morning and early afternoon balcony sun whenever in my room.I was impressed with the friendly and easy check in and subsequent dealings with staff. Unlike a lot of other establishments, my room was serviced very early each day by exceptionally friendly staff. I was most impressed The room was quite spacious, the bed was comfortable and everything worked. Perhaps as an aside though the room was somewhat utilitarian and plain.A bit of downside is the very basic and ordinary breakfast serviced poolside at the 3rd level.

The self-parking lot was extremely small and was always full, so the only option was to pay for valet parking or to find parking at another hotel's parking lot. We were fortunate to receive a free upgrade to a deluxe room which was very spacious. Cleanliness was average -- I found a hair in the bathroom on the hand towel rack. The free breakfast offered eggs, bacon, french toast, bread, fruits, and cereal along with coffee and juices. Ambiance of the breakfast area is nice. Free wifi!Overall, this is a great budget hotel.

Last minute the prices rose however. No extra resort fee. Feels like a good business hotel. Not a resort. Location excellent - two blocks (around 5 minutes walking? Less?) from Kuhio Beach, just south of Waikiki Beach proper. Kuhio is pleasant, with a seawall making it calmer. Otherwise you could easily walk north to Waikiki, to check out the main drag of shopping along the beach (which is open late, til 1030pm, for tourists), or check out Waikiki beach. You can grab free clean beach towels from the pool area, then drop them off when you return. Staff were in general very friendly - from the front desk to the car valets. Only exception was one night when we went down to the front desk to ask about how to get around to see the Honolulu city area, after the concierge had left for the night - the Japanese guy at the desk was unfriendly and didn't even make eye contact. Rooms were clean, very spacious (with a separate sofa area). Sink was outside the toilet / shower room. Beds were big and comfortable, though I found them too soft - softer than your average mattress. Maid service was friendly too. There is a breakfast included in your stay! It's a buffet near the pool area. There were a couple of hot items - one egg / meat based, one bread / waffle / toast based, a station with rice / miso soup / kim chee / tofu, a set of a couple types of pastries / bagels, and fruit / yogurt / cereal. Free juices, water, milk, coffee and tea. It wasn't super delicious or anything - kind of bland mass produced food - but it was free, good, plentiful and filling. WiFi was free and very fast, another nice bonus. Facilities are okay. Pool is kind of lame, but you're not there to stay at the pool. Parking is pricey, as it is everywhere in Waikiki - $25 a night for self park (which was never available while we were there), or $30 a day for valet. The valets were all very friendly, and took the initiative in helping with luggage. They seemed genuinely pleased when I slipped them a couple bucks each day. We called form the room before heading down, at usually didn't have to wait long. There was a mix of guests. Americans, Aussies, lots of Koreans, some Japanese and Chinese. Some families, some business travellers, some couples. It wasn't overrun with kids, if you want to avoid that, I think because there wasn't a lot of on-site resort stuff. Overall - if you book early - it's a relatively inexpensive place to stay in the Waikiki area. Not a resort - has a basic pool, but no attached shopping mall. Restaurant seemed basic - never tried it. Rooms aren't very fancy, but are nice. But you're in Hawaii to see the beach, not stay at the hotel - and this place was perfect for that. Book early for a god price. Free breakfast and WiFi. No resort fee. Big clean rooms to sleep in, close to everything.

I just decided to take the 2 queens since I would like to rest from the flight and settle everything. When I got in the room, I found it to be very spacious, more than a usual hotel room in Hawaii. There were 2 queen beds, and a sofa sleeper. Lots of space to walk around. The Lanai was clean and beautiful. Next morning breakfast had some variety, including miso soup, white rice, juice, egg, sausage, fresh fruit, coffee, etc. Simple but good. The seating was all outdoor, which was fine. The beach is only couple of minutes walk, and convenient store and restaurants very close by. Mini fridge in the room. I would recommend this Hyatt Place.

From the very beginning the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. The on-site travel coordinators were great to have there as well. They really made booking an all day trip to Pearl Harbor easy. I could see someone posting a less than stellar review if they had a mountain view room on a low floor but we booked an ocean view on a high floor and it was awesome and worth a few extra bucks. The hotel is within walking distance to everything we wanted, including a 3 minute walk to the beach. We also took in the Honolulu Zoo which is a 5 minute walk as well. Breakfast was great every day. How can you beat a free hot breakfast in Oahu with the prices there? The pool was a bit small but there weren't many people at the pool anyway.

Our room was huge, with 2 Very plush Queen sized beds, very comfy pillows and a separate lounge area with a three seater lounge and a single chair. We also had 2 balconies, both with a table and 2 chairs,which were great for drying our clothes. We didn't have much of a view as we overlooked the side street, but there was no street noise even though we were on the 2nd floor. The room had a Tea/ Coffee machine with coffe pods and tea bags supplied, my only complaint, was there was no milk supplied. Buffet Breakfast was included and was basic, but adequate. Most of our evening meals were at restaurants on or near the main strip, but we did order room service a couple of times and found the prices quite reasonable. For basics, like snacks, milk and alcohol we went to the ABC store a few doors down, these stores are everywhere and stocked just about everything, including food, souvenirs, clothing, alcohol, sunscreen, medicines and beach inflatables.

We were on the 20th floor with a view of the ocean although you see some buildings - but it was great! The beds were super comfortable as were the pillows. And that is saying A LOT. I travel everywhere with my own pillow due to past experiences so I honestly don't recall a hotel that I enjoyed their pillows (even high end 5 star hotels that cost 5 times the amount). Also air conditioning worked well and housekeeping kept our room spotless every day. Bonus was the Toto washlet toilet seat cover - not sure if all rooms have it - but it was nice. If you don't know what it is - google it :P Breakfast was included every day and while it may not have been 5 star it was decent! I was happy with it! also there are free towels that you get to take with you to the beach from the front lobby which is only a couple blocks away (not very far at all). People and staff are so friendly and welcoming!! I would definitely recommend this hotel. It's great that there is no additional resort fee and wifi is free! :) How awesomeTHANK you for a wonderful stay and a special shout out to Lei who was a great housekeeper with such kindness and does an amazing job. I highly recommend the hyatt place. I've stayed at condos before and this is way better in terms of cleanliness and while it doesn't have stove, there are lots of restaurants to try out by checking out tripadvisor or yelp that are not too pricey.

I arrived at 6 am in the morning and asked the front desk to hold my luggage for the day since check-in isn't until mid-afternoon. They had me wait for 2 minutes and then surprised me by allowing me to check-in at 6 am which was amazing. I had time to go upstairs, unpack and make it to the 3rd floor for the 6:30 am - 10 am complimentary breakfast. I have read mostly negative reviews about this FREE breakfast. Yes it is mostly outdoor seating, maybe 20 chairs with tables for outdoor covered dining and then another 100 or so chairs outdoors mostly with large umbrellas to protect you from the sun. I ate outside 12 mornings and 2 mornings had a very light mist sprinkles which was not a problem. You can also use a large 24"" x 16"" tray to bring food to your room or the lobby dining area to enjoy your FREE breakfast. Breakfast every day includes steamed rice, kimshi, variety of bagels, English muffins, toast, choice of yogurts, granalos, pastries, cereals, milk, apple juice, orange juice, scrambled eggs, amazing pineapple. Every few days they rotate pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausage, and breakfast sandwich with spinach, ham, egg, cheese on an English muffin. I am sure I am missing a few items but these are the foods I enjoyed at breakfast. Now you can go to the Hilton Hawaiian Village buffet and get a few other items and made to order eggs but you will pay $34 per person for breakfast. The Hyatt also does not charge for wifi, they have computers and printers for FREE, local phone calls are free, fitness center free, no resort/hospitality fee, on the 3rd floor they have washers & dryers for guest use. I had a meeting room at the hotel 9 days from 8 am - 8 pm. Every morning the room was unlocked on time for me, they replenished my beverages, trash was empty and they checked on me at least once per day to see if I needed anything. My sales Manager Michelle is AMAZING to work with and as a person. The front office/lounge/valet staff is 5 star. The room size is standard, very clean, and in excellent condition. The lunch/dinner food available in the lobby was good and beats walking to another place, waiting 30 minutes for a table after a long 12 hour work day. Having ""Stella"" on tap was great in the frosted glasses. I spend 100+ nights a year in hotels and have stayed in 5 star resort and business hotels. However, the staff at Hyatt Place Waikiki is the best overall staff I have EVER experienced in all of my travels. In 8 days I will be in San Diego on business, and I am cancelling my reservation at another chain and will be staying at a Hyatt Place or ""sister"" property.

We reviewed most of the hotels along Waikiki Beach and finally selected ""Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach"". So let me share this with you. Which hotel along Waikiki Beach has these offerings : [1] No resort Fee [2] Free WiFi [3] Breakfast included [4] Hospitality suite for guest with late departures [5] Waikiki Beach is just 5 mins down the road [6+7+8 ... see their website]. None that we have come across except this Hotel with a Heart ...Hyatt Place ! OK, do understand that this hotel has a Hyatt brand and it's designed with a resort ambience. If you are expecting to see the hotel designed like a Hyatt in New York or Singapore, then, its not. Maybe the Hyatt Regency down the road may meet your expectations. So, let me share with you. The Hyatt Place is located at the tail end of Waikiki Beach strip [just round the corner from the zoo]. It may not have the beach front but Waikiki Beach is just 5 mins away from the entrance of the hotel. Walk out onto the street turn left and the beautiful sandy beach is just 5 mins away.About the hotel. In my opinion, it is a high 3.75 star resort property. And what is important is that this property is very professionally managed. The service team, from the front desk, to the F&B service and the housekeeping crew they are really outstanding. Everyone is very polite and has a smile on their face any time of the day and all ready to assist you. We like Andre at the front desk..super helpful.Smiles and a friendly team definitely adds to any wonderful experience. There are 2 towers. We stayed on the 3rd floor of the tower that served breakfast. The carpeted room was a good size furnished with the expected hotel furniture. Nice and functional designs not old, not worn-out furniture, well maintained as we understand that the hotel was upgraded just a few years ago. Good size vanity area and good size toilet cum shower cubicle. Night curtains and sheers added to the ambience of the room. Air-conditioning quiet. We had complementary 5 bottles of locally brewed beer in the fridge and a plate of fruits. That was a very nice touch. Otherwise all the necessary bells and whistles are provided in the room. We did not have to request for anything that was missing. The room was clean and plenty of towels available. Beach towels available at the front desk. Housekeeping and maintenance crew are on the ball, everyday. Breakfast by the patio on the 3rd floor. A Very good spread [you will be surprised]. Different menu daily. Plenty to eat. Fresh pineapple galore. Was looking forward to papayas but apparently not served. Anyway, if you are a breakfast person be assured you will not starve. The kids will have a ball. Coffee is Seattle's Best which [in my opinion] yuks !. Maybe the way the coffee was prepared. Needs a serious review by the management. Take your breakfast to your room if you like. They are easy with that. Because the hotel does not have a beach front, the rooms on the lower floors does not have any great views. You're facing the property next to this hotel and that was our only 'X' mark on our list. The location of the hotel is just outstanding. Everything you will want to experience is within walking distance along Waikiki Beach. ABC stores[convenient stores] are located around every corner [just like Starbucks in Vancouver]. Finally, check out is at 11am. And if your departure flight is a late fight in the night, the hotel offers a hospitality room [ 45 minutes] for you to take a shower etc, free !. Now that's really nice. I highly recommend the Hyatt Place Waikiki and I wish you a very happy vacation if you're on the way there !","Vancouver, Canada","R0nSIM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",18,4.0

They are mostly the same and always a pleasure. That's why when I found one in the area we wanted on vacation, I jumped on it. Our options for rooms were typical King/Queen with Choices of City, Mountain or Beach views. We chose the city with sofa bed. They all advertised the sofa bed. We didn't care about the sofa bed, but did care about the extra space and seating, something we have come to expect from these properties. All of the photos showed a SOFA bed AND all descriptions were of a SOFA bed. When we arrived the room had a chair for one person, tucked tightly in the corner, that COULD become a bed. When we asked to move to a room with a sofa bed, they were accommodating and honored the original rate, but assigned us an identical room! That was a serious error. On try 3 we received the room we expected. The rest of the stay was pleasant with good service but it should also be noted that the elevators are VERY slow and not adequate for the size property. They also advertise a self-park option as opposed to their valet, but when we arrived that turns out to be a private garage down the street that is not affiliated with the property and is cash only.","Orlando, FL","vtchaz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, FL</strong>",30,4.0

In the past, for both cases it usually meant dated rooms or lightly renovations in an old (sometimes moldy) shell. The HP Waikiki is an example of a good renovation of what was once an old ""budget-friendly"" hotel (I believe the old Ocean Resort). In this case, the owners did a good job of doing a gut renovation of the property so that most everything is new. The rooms are good but depending on which tower you get, you either get the standard (larger) HP room or a much tighter and smaller version of it. From what I could tell, it seems that the rooms closer to the ocean have the smaller rooms (a tradeoff for views?). I found the smaller rooms definitely tight for 2 people while the larger standard rooms were a nice surprise to find in Waikiki.Staff here is very friendly and helpful. On one occasion I needed to pay with multiple gift cards and the agent needed some extra time to process them but did so cheerfully. Beach towels are obtained from the front desk and are readily available----it's a short 7 minute walk to the (nicer) beaches in Waikiki. Plenty of food options are nearby (the onsite restaurant is more geared towards breakfast pastries and prepackaged sandwiches). As for the complimentary breakfast buffet, try to avoid prime times as it can get extremely busy with long waits in line and low table availability. On a side note, if staying multiple days, you may get tired of the sameness of the buffet (the hot egg entree changes only slightly each day) so either don't try everything the same morning or go elsewhere to break up the monotony.The best thing about the HP Waikiki besides location and friendly staff??

We do accept some responsibility for not checking to see if we could have gotten a better room for, as I said, the staff was very accommodating. We did not eat at the hotel so I cannot speak to a dinning experience except for the breakfast brunch. We felt the breakfast was very carb loaded with very little protein which was not to our liking. We also noticed that the sound level room to room was not great as we heard the toilet from the neighbors room each time it was used. The location was very convenient to the beach, shopping and restaurants. Getting out for touring by car was easy enough. Probably if there is another visit to Hawaii we would not stay in the Waikiki area.","Chantilly, Virginia","Gladelle H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chantilly, Virginia</strong>",56,3.0

The staff was nice, the room was what we needed and the location was good.. the valet on the other hand.. TERRIBLE! We arrived at Honolulu airport,picked up our car from Hertz and drove straight to the hotel where we handed it over to valet. Around 8 pm we needed to pick up some medicine so we asked valet for our car.. it arrived back to us with a large dent and several deep scratches on the front right fender, down the passenger side of the vehicle and the passenger side mirror was scratched up. They were fresh and the white paint from the walls of the parking garage were still attached. It appeared as if the car had hit a median or curb at a decent rate of speed then dragged up along a wall.. you know.. while parking in a tight spot in a crowded garage by young and gung ho valet boys. When we pointed it out the valet guy was like.. ""ohhh dang.. another one!! That's our second one for today!"" The other valet then proceeded to tell me ""I bet I know who did it.. it always happens when we have to juggle the cars between garages to accommodate the hotel guests and the beach goers who pay for parking here.. its not uncommon. That sucks!"" Apparently this is not a rare thing and after filling out an incident report we were assured by valet that they have cameras showing our car arriving and leaving the lot & that we would be covered as our rental car was not delivered to them in this manner. It was a stressful thing to happen on the FIRST day of your vacation and I went to bed that night not relaxed and not happy that I would now have to contend with Hertz and cut my vacation short to spend the time sorting it out with them at the airport. Upon returning from our vacation we received a letter from the valet company that said they were not responsible and were not going to pay for the damage. No reason was given other than we are not responsible. I was absolutely gobsmacked with this response. How would they not be responsible?! I was also taken a back that the hotel basically says ""not our problem, we contract out the valet service.."" well you might ant to let your guests know this info prior to handing over the keys to their car :-/ I would def have found a self park lot if I had known how many accidents that actually happen and that neither responsible party would take responsibility. Because of this lackluster and stressful experience that ended up costing me $600 I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone who drives a car and needs to park it for the night.. and if you do then make sure and use one of the paid self park lots in the near vicinity to the hotel.","Seattle, Washington","Shinybrightskies</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",15,1.0

The only drawback was that the sink was located in the sleeping area as opposed to the bathroom which housed only the toilet and tub/shower. There was a good-sized in-room safe as well.

However, this was no problem as buses and the trolley stop virtually at the hotel door and can get you anywhere you want to go. Also, the hotel is a less than a 5-minute walk to the zoo, the beach, and a large, beautiful seaside park.

We were very satisfied with our decision and very happy with the room allocated to us.We found our room to be spacious and very comfortable.Staff in particular were very friendly and very helpful.The complimentary breakfast was perfectly adequate, diverse, and plentiful if a little plain.Overall we were very happy with our decision to stay at the Hyatt Place and would stay there again.",,Linds_Tones,14,4.0

The hotel is good value for money. We stayed in a King City view room and the room was quite spacious and we even got a small glimpse of the ocean from our room. Our room was on the 10th floor of the Diamond Head Tower. Overall, we are very happy with the room itself. There are three lifts servicing the Diamond Head Tower (instead of 2 for the Pali Tower). We didn't have to wait for the lifts at all even during the supposedly busy times. But you do have to wait a bit at peak times if you are staying in the Pali Tower. The gallery staff and the valet staff were very friendly and attentive. The housekeeping service wasn''t that great. One day they didn't refill the coffee pods so I rang to request and waited for a few hours in the room but that never showed up. The free breakfast was delicious and it wasn't too crowded at all. But we brought the breakfast up into our room a few days and ate on the lanai which was very nice too. A reason for this (other than to enjoy the lanai) was that there are about five steps if you are accessing the pool/breakfast area from the Diamond Head Tower. There is a wheelchair lift but you have to ask a staff member to use it as the lift needs a key to operate. I am not in a wheelchair but can't climb stairs and the look I got from staff when asked to use the lift made me reluctant to use it again. On our last day, we had breakfast by the pool but I used the Pali Tower lift to exit to avoid going up those steps and avoid having to ask a staff member to help, and then walk all the way back to the Diamond Head Tower to get back to our room. The laundry is also on the third floor inside the Pali Tower but you can access it from the Diamond Head Tower too. If you like to walk around the area surrounding the hotel and you have issues with steps, I would suggest reconsidering staying at this hotel. There are about 5 steps to get to the lobby from the street level (you can go around it by going up a fairly steep slope/driveway if slopes are no issue). Again there is a wheelchair lift attached to it but it was covered and doesn't look like it has been used any time recently. You also need a staff member to operate the lift and that was a put-off for me. The ability to text with our questions about the hotel was really great and the response was quick. The free wifi is really great and fast (better than HHV). So overall, it is a good place to stay but there is room for improvement and it is perhaps not the most suitable place for people who have similar mobility issues.",Australia,"Green098</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",36,4.0

Firstly after travelling for 18 hours, 2 members of staff took 15 minutes to find my reservation- even though I showed them my receipt, the date and the company I found them through. When they found it and one of them was allocating my sister and I a room - the other person whispered ""why are you giving THEM THAT ROOM?"". Regardless as to the reason- this is totally unacceptable and if I wasn't so tired from my travelling I would have asked her to say that out loud or try to be a bit professional. I paid $100 deposit which is normal and told that I would get it back automatically and it would be in my account the day that I check out.Upon my checkout 14 days later, the man on the desk told me I owed them $30 for using the valet service - I told him I owed them nothing, as I didn't use any valet service. This turned into an argument - until I told him that it is impossible for my sister and I to have used valet as neither of us can DRIVE. With that said he looked through the records and found that it was a mistake of someone writing our room number down with some other guests name. He told us that we would not have to pay as we did not use the service.I got home and found that my $100 had not been refunded, additionally I had been charged $30 for valet - even though I was told that I would not be charged. I was also charged an additional $50 at the end of my stay- I was confused. So I emailed the hotel and they said I would receive $100 in 3-5 working days. They said nothing of the other two charges. I emailed them another 4 times regarding the mystery $50 charge and the $30 valet charge and I heard nothing back from them. I didn't break anything - I'm very careful about that kind of thing. I understand that mistakes happen but why have an email address if you are going to ignore your customers? All they needed to do was apologise and explain what had happened and tell me when I would get my money back. I did not get $100 back after 5 days.I reviewed this hotel elsewhere and only then I got a response- apparently $50 charge is for incidental hold- if this is the case why have $100 at check in? I was told that the $100 was for incidental hold. So they have an incidental hold they tell you about and then take more money and don't tell you about it. They took the $50 12 days after I checked in. I got my money refunded 30 days later and not in 3-5 days like they said. All $180.They said they they would hate to permanently lose a customer and they would like a chance to redeem themselves- but why would I give them a chance to lie to me again and ignore me? This hotel has lost a customer FOREVER. I am travelling back to Waikiki again next week for another two weeks and I did not even consider Hyatt Place and will never, ever return there again.

Safe and ironing board is all in the wardrobes as well as the ice maker being on every floor at the lifts. The beach is just in sight as the hotel is set a few hotels back. Just a short walk to all the shops in Waikiki, the zoo, and diamond head! Plus there's a little bike/moped hire shop around the corner. Breakfast is included. It's rather basic but everything you'd need. You eat outside on the roof where it can get a bit windy, or take it back to your room.

There's a little abc store the next building along on your way to the beach.The only downside really was the parking - no self park.

The kids came from Bixby,Oklahoma (close to Tulsa, Oklahoma). I went with my daughter and her 3 kids plus one other girl to help her. The kids ranged from 6 to 11 years. We were in Honolulu for 8 days and overall had a great time. I had been to Honolulu on business 2 times previously and stayed at Aulani (a Disney hotel on the other side of the island).The pluses and minuses for Hyatt Place Waikki Beach for me are as follows: * PLUSES:  ** Location:  ***** Beaches: the hotel is a very short distance from the beach and has a lot of things to do: Swimming in areas that the waves don't come in too high because of concrete walls that reduce the force of the waves. In other areas there are pretty good waves and there are a lot of surfers. ***** Shopping: Excellent shopping on the road that goes along the beaches. Lots of excellent shops and your usual lower take home souvenirs. ***** Places to eat: There are a lot of great restaurants and the usual lower ones such as McDonalds, Starbucks, etc.  ** Hyatt staff: Excellent staff that are very friendly and helpful.   ** Hyatt Food: We ate breakfast at the Hyatt and for the most part it was excellent. We were on the go on all the days and ate lunch and supper at other places from the hotel. The hotel provides an excellent breakfast buffet that has a lot of choices. The only downside was long you stayed there because the food menu changes to the same food every other day. * MINUSES: ** Elevators: they only have two elevators (except for the ones in the back of the hotel for the special guests). These elevators are overwhelmed at times and long lines build up. You will get to you floor but it can be somewhat problematic. ** Parking: There is no self parking at the Hyatt unless you park on the street but that can be a problem since you would probably get a ticket. The hotel has a parking area but you must use the Hyatt staff to park the car and bring it back to you when you want your car. So it is not a big issue but you pay for the parking and also should tip the bellhops. All in all the Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach hotel is a very good place and the pluses are much better than the minuses.

The room service food quality was much better than anticipated - a good selection and tasted fresh! WIFI was strong and the included breakfast was good (it is very popular/busy though!).

While it is not on the beach, it is a quick and easy walk over. I would rather walk for a couple minutes and save money at a slightly off-beach hotel. The room was spacious enough. There wasn't much anything special from any other hotel room - besides the bidet that wouldn't work for us, but you don't spend much time in your room in Hawaii anyway. The beds were comfortable, and our lanai had a great view. We got an ocean view room and requested a high floor (got 18th out of 20 floors). If you want a view, request the high floors. There were a couple buildings obstructing it, but a great view nonetheless for a hotel not on the beach. Breakfast was good, but it was hard to find seating. The one big complaint was elevator wait times. There are two for the whole hotel. The hotel does acknowledge this with a letter stating the busy times for the elevator. During breakfast, you could find yourself waiting for at least 5 minutes. We tried to take the stairs from level 3 (where breakfast is) to the ground since we were late for a tour. Turns out the ground floor door is for fire only. We had to go back up and wait. I understand that for security purposes, as you need a key card to get to your floor, but it was an annoyance to take the elevator down 2 floors. There is a 24/7 bar, but no room service.Even with a few cons, it was still a great stay. The employees were all very helpful and friendly. I did not have one negative experience with the employees. The hotel is fresh and clean, and the service is wonderful. Plus, there's no resort fee and breakfast and WiFi are free.

Hotel is just one block from the beach no more than 10 mins walking at the pace of a 4yr old. Shops and plenty of restaurants are within walking distance. If renting a car (which in my opinion it's not really nessecary in Waikiki, everything is within walking or a quick cab or bus trip away) parking is $30 a day yikes! we had a 1 day car rental to explore North Shore and circle the island at our pace. Free breakfast buffet, again pleasantly surprised the selection of hot items are different everyday and tasty. There was also an everyday nice selection of pastries, cereals, fruits, breads etc. Free WiFi was great no dropped signal.

After 20 hrs trip, we were greeted by Christopher. The check in took like 5 min, and we didn't have to wait. I was upgraded to Ocean view, but I am glad I didn't pay for it since you see it through the buildings. I was concerned about the elevator problems that I read. We stayed at the Diamond tower, and It wasn't any wait. I heard the Ocean Tower had serious waiting time, and that is because there are only two elevators.The room was very clean, no bath tub. The WiFi, the breakfast and beach towels were complementary. The breakfast can save you good money since food in Hawaii is pretty pricey. The bus stop is just across the street in Kuhio Ave (2.50 adult and $1.25 children) The only problem with the bus is that it can't take 1 1/2 just to go to the airport. They have laundry facilities in the 3rd floor on the Ocean tower just beside the gym; $3 a load and you can use your credit card if you don't have quarters. I would recommend this hotel since the Marriott across the street doesn't have front view either, at least the tower in Kuhio Ave, and they have to pay resort fee $30 per day, and WiFi $15 per day.Finally, I had a night flight, and I didn't know what to do with my suitcases.

As a platinum member of the Hyatt Gold Passport program, this hotel has left a very bad image of the Hyatt brand. The many grievances started with the 15 minute wait to check in. The guy was efficient and friendly, however have incorrect information of the ""happy hour"" times and sadly we missed out on the ""cheap"" alcohol. The next issue was with room service; we ordered a hamburger with chips and the hamburger came with potato chips, not fries!! I have never experienced receiving potato chips with ANY meal before. This was quite disappointing, especially for the exorbitant price of the burger. Thirdly, the complimentary breakfast was very dismal and had only ONE hot option (bacon) and there were no bowls to be seen anywhere for cereal, so we were advised by the staff to use drinking glasses. Again another disappointing element of this stay. Fourthly, and perhaps the WORST aspect of this stay was the valet parking experience. Not only is the price INSANSE at $30 per night, but we waited 34 minutes in the lobby for the car to actually arrive. Yes, 34 minutes, we timed it as we saw the long queue of people waiting. This is absolutely ridiculous for an upmarket hotel chain. Once the car arrived we then proceeded to wait a further 9 minutes behind other cars with no one in them as both lanes of the hotel exit were blocked with cars. All up we wasted 43 minutes collecting the car. The staff doing this service looked stressed, and I cannot fault them at all. They did refund one nights valet parking fee. On a side note, we booked the 'Deluxe Ocean View Room' and it was anything BUT a deluxe room. The view had a slight view of the ocean in between buildings, but it wasn't that great. My advice is to save your money and get a cheaper room as the view is definitely not worth the premium price!!

Some people may find breakfast limited but it is important to note that there is no charge for this breakfast.In terms of location, it is located a few minutes walk to Waikiki Beach. It is also walking distance to shopping areas and restaurants. It is also close to the zoo.There is also a grocery store 10 to 15 mins walk (Food Pantry, 2370 Kuhio Ave), they have meal options that are more affordable (e.g. roast chicken, fried noodles, etc).If you want to get on the pink line, it does stop at Aston Waikiki beach hotel (opposite Waikiki beach) just a short walk from Hyatt Place.In the event that you need additional help, as in our case we needed to find an emergency dentist, the staff was at hand to assist find one and also provide some advice.Check out at night time can be a bit slow, so you should come down earlier if you are travelling by shuttle or organized transportation to the airport.Would I stay there again?YES, I would, there is not doubt.","Bonn, Germany","Deevahn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bonn, Germany</strong>",35,5.0

I traveled with a teenager and young daughters and we stayed at the 17 floor. The elevator did not cause any problems to our vacation. Just like traffic lights, you have to be patient. Yes, the wait time is a little longer during high traffic time like morning breakfast and check out time but wait time throughout the day was not bad at all. If you are in hurry, then take the stairs. We heard a lady complaining that she waited for the elevator for 15 minutes. She was waiting from the 5th floor to get off at the 3rd floor. She could have just taken the stairs..... We love the convenience of the complimentary beach towels and the complimentary breakfast.

We had one comfortable bed, and one bed - the one by the window - that gave all of us aches the next morningI I really enjoyed staying here, despite the CONS: 1. really busy - large groups tend to book here, e.g., tourist groups, school sports teams,etc. - it can get loud, chaotic; we asked for a quiet area of the hotel, got a room at the end of the hall, but was next to a suite which had lots of people staying in it so tended to be loud; 2. elevators can be quite slow when crowds of people are staying there; 3. no free parking and no lots nearby to park at cheaper rates - the day we got there, the hotel's self parking lot was full, so we were forced to use valet parking - the good thing was that the hotel did not charge us for valet - still, self parking costs $18/day!PROS: 1.) The hotel is located on the east side of the Waikiki strip, which I liked because we were away from the busy activity but close enough to walk to lots of restaurants, shops, etc. Also a short walk away from the Honolulu Zoo. Really good complimentary breakfast - includes hot items like (slow-cooked) oatmeal, some variation of scrambled eggs every day, and Asian breakfast dishes; also served were cut fruit, cereal, pastries, milk, juice. I recommend bringing your tray from your room to the breakfast buffet so you can bring everything back to your room - the dining area is outside by the pool, and it can get really really windy!! We didn't use the pool, by the way, so no comment, except it is modest in size. 2.) Nice beach - easy walk from hotel! This area of the beach is great for small kids because there is a wall buffer that minimizes the waves and keeps the waters gentle - my daughter loved being in the water! AND the hotel gave out complimentary beach toys - score for my daughter! 3.) All nice, helpful staff - thanks to Terence, Ted, and Troy!!

Technically, that was true, although we had to look between two very run down buildings to see a glimpse of a mountain. I normally spend a lot of time on the balcony, but not this time.

Cons- the pool was small but no one really used it2. The fire alarm rang near midnight one night and everyone had to evacuate via the stairs. You can imagine the congestion. Everyone was very calm though. One elderly lady became so exhausted (we were in the 14 or 17 floor) that she began hyperventilating.

It is also walking distance to many shops, beaches, eateries etc. Outside are bus stops to get you all around the Island. I took a $2.50 bus to Pearl Harbour as well as a different bus to Diamond Head. The hotel itself is average. Reasonably quite (I was on the second highest floor), clean, comfy beds and pillows as well as a very useful breakfast skillet, pool and gym (see pictures). However I have food intolerances and this is the first hotel under the Hyatt chain around the world that haven’t been able to accommodate, even just a little bit – no gluten free bread. The cleaning staff were very friendly in their nature and how they spoke to me in the hallways, however I didn’t receive the same friendly vibe with other staff members, in actual fact I would err on the side of them being rude. At the breakfast buffet, for example, when I was wanting to walk through to find a seat, a staff member would push in front of me with their breakfast trolley (collecting dirty dishes or placing clean one out or updating the food at the buffet) instead of allowing myself or others through first and there wasn’t even any acknowledgement or thanks for me standing back and waiting for the staff member (this happened on more than one occasion with different staff members). Also I would recommend if you are deciding to use Hyatt Place as a hotel to stay at ensure that you don’t arrive before 3pm. Due to my flight arriving into Honolulu in the morning and myself getting to the hotel about 10am I was left sitting on a couch in the hot reception area until 3pm. Again there was no acknowledgement of me after I had spoken to staff of my arrival and I had told the hotel prior to my arrival that I would be early. Another factor would be to ask to be away from the lifts/elevators as they constantly beep and I was lucky enough to be down the corridor but I only had to walk closer to the elevators to hear there beep as the reach every level. Also there was no information given to me on the layout of the hotel or a map of the area.Despite all of this it was a good place to stay for what I needed and for the type of hotel it is and there were certainly very happy families around the hotel. You may be able to find a better deal at another nearby and better hotel if you are travelling as a couple or single or try and get a lower bargain deal rather than paying full price.","Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","Cara J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Victoria, Australia</strong>",6,3.0

The pool is very small, no lounge or bar. No room to sunbathe, which is a problem for me...I like the beach but I would like at least one day not to have sand everywhere. So, I had to call around to other hotels to rent a cabana for the day...no other hotels would allow cabana rental to outside guests until I called the Hyatt Regency which is down the street, I thought because it was the Hyatt family it would be no problem, well they gave me a hard time, I had to basically beg to make it happen. I got at least one day without sand...LOL! The gym is very small...not enough equipment for the size of hotel and the number of guest.

The staff is very helpful and they have an activities desk right in the lobby.A couple of pointers. Do not waste your money on paying for a ocean view. You can only see parts of the ocean unless you are on the top floor. There are too many buildings in the way. Also, get to breakfast early if you want a seat and don't want to wait in line for 20 minutes. The breakfast is very good and changes daily, but it gets crazy crowded in there.

Overall this hotel was great. the rooms were nice and big and clean. ( nowhere near as big as the standard Hyatt Place, just as an fyi) So a couple of annoyances, valet was sooooo understaffed at check in ( and 3 other times) so over crowded we couldn't even pull in, we had to park the car on the street when they could tell we were agitated with the 20 minute plus wait. Next came check in, all seemed good, got up to room, city view. I had already prepaid through their website for an ocean view room. I called down and they tried to convince me they gave me an upgraded room which was better than the ocean view room I had paid for I explained I will take my chances with the downgrade, I wanted to see the ocean. They said they'd get right back to me, 15 minutes later I call down again, and they say, oh ya we have a room for you come back down. no offer to help move us or anything. So Shlub back down to the front desk, get the new keys, go to new room. oceanview, with balcony, and overall a good room. Pros:Rooms were cleanRooms were spacious and what you'd expect from a hyattgreat location, on the far end of Waikiki beach, right by the zoo. staff was great, especially valet guys, especially with being so overworked.Cons: -tried to pass off a city view room as an ""upgrade"" on a room I had paid for already, direct from them! -Poor Valet guys are understaffed, they needed some help. One last thing, the gift shop in the back part of the lobby has the cheapest water, sodas and gatorades pretty much anywhere in that area.

While I thought the location was great, just one block back from Waikiki Beach, it was the little things that let me down. The other positive was the size of the room, it was huge and very comfortable (2 queen size beds and a sofa) and the view of the beach was wonderful. The beds were also very comfortable. Now the cons: loud airconditioning (the techician did come up and adjusted the temperature but advised us to keep the fan low to keep the noise down); housekeeping was very disappointing - four days there were dark hairs in the bath after the daily service; the mirror in the entry was never cleaned; there was no shower cap or body lotion provided. I was told later that I could have rung down for both these items, however, when you are naked or in your underwear, the last thing you want to do is ring reception and then wait 20 minutes for these items to be delivered. Both should have been available in the room already. There was also an issue with the bed pillows never being put back on the bed or the replacement glasses/mugs being put back in the cabinet. I expect to walk into the room at the end of the day to a room that is set up like it was the first day. The service was very disappointing for a Hyatt. The other issue was the free breakfast. And yes I know I shouldn't complain, it was free, but there were issues. Firstly it was on the pool deck. Too bad if you wanted a quiet early morning swim - there were 100s of spectators watching you. There other issue was the wind which caused you to bolt down everything otherwise it was blown away. As a consequence the floor was littered with butter and jam containers and lots of napkins. Definitely a tripping hazard. The other issue was the birds - flying everywhere, trying to get to the food. Not very hygienic and not pleasant as they swooped around your face. I have raised all these matters with hotel management who have been very positive in their response which I appreciate. I don't complain frivilously but there were obviously issues at this hotel that I just would not expect from a Hyatt. My booking was partly based on the experience that I expected from the brand. I hope the next time I visit (and I'd be happy to stay there again) I hope to see some changes made especially to housekeeping.","Perth, Australia","Silkstrawberry</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",38,3.0

The Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach checks all of these boxes.The rooms themselves exceeded our expectations. They were very large - we were travelling with a family of five and never felt like we were on top of one another. And I loved the fact that they realize that stuffing the room's fridge with ridiculously priced food and beverages that no-one will ever buy doesn't serve either their or their guests' purposes. Having an empty fridge was a wonderful addition.The no-charge breakfast buffet was great. I was a little surprised by the hours, but it ends up the busiest time is between about 6:30 and 7:00.

It's only a short walk to the 'action' in Waikiki. We arrived quite late and tired after a delayed flight, the check in staff couldn't have been more accommodating providing us with a room on a higher floor for an extra quiet sleep. I would definitely request a room on a high floor of possible as the noise and traffic from the street may keep some awake- however it's like that in Waikiki no matter where you stay we've found. The room itself was generous in size and had all the classic ammenities you need. It was an older hotel renovated, but really clean with new furnishings.

I thought I would follow up on TripAdvisor as the deal was much cheaper compared to other hotels in Waikiki. After reading some of the reviews we decided to go ahead with the booking. The hotel is in a brilliant location less than a 5 minute walk away from the main beach promenade where there are plenty of wonderful restaurants and shops. The room rate includes complimentary breakfast and wifi. Breakfast has a couple of hot options and the rest is continental. Wifi is really quick and convenient for when you are travelling. The hotel has a bar, gym, pool, self service laundry, breakfast area and tour desk. Public areas of the hotel are modern and really well appointed such as the lobby. We booked a standard ocean view room as we got such a great rate. The room was well appointed, super clean and surprisingly much more modern than we thought after seeing photos of other hotels in Waikiki. Air con was great and the TV had a great selection of channels. The bed was amazing I had the best sleep in months! The staff are the most professional and friendly team that I have ever come across. Terrence who checked us in called within minutes of us arriving in our room to make sure we were happy with what we were getting. I worked in hotels for over 8 years and never received service like this. Don't be discouraged by some of the negative reviews you see on here. The pool is small but you come to Hawaii for the beach which is 5 minutes away. The birds at breakfast only come from people who do not clean up after themselves, there is even signage to say don't feed the birds or leave food behind. There are no problems with the lifts I never had to wait longer than a minute. Will happily recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely return with my family again!

The front desk writes your suite # and also the free WiFi password on your room key envelope. The free WiFi is pretty fast (25MBish), as a side note. There is no Resort Fee with this hotel which is a huge Plus, I upgraded my room instead with the money. My balcony view of Diamond Head and the ocean was nice. Although I'd assume all the ocean view rooms will be looking in between other buildings to the water. Room was very clean, especially the bathroom. The cleaning staff I saw on the 18th floor were always very nice. One of them already knew when I was leaving and wished me a good flight! One of the reasons I chose this hotel over others was the included breakfast as part of your stay. By the fourth day of breakfast sandwiches in a row, I had already predicted the next mornings first meal when the chef surprised us on Friday with bacon, scrambled eggs, and pancakes. It was like light had started shining through the sky. Please stop the madness and mix up breakfast a little! The gym was overall Very Good. Lots of free weight variety. Nice modern looking machines from Good Life Fitness, also fresh towels and a cold water (and cups) station. Bathroom on site if you want to wash your hands after using the equipment. Pool area was pretty clean. There are towel cupboards on site which were always stocked. Lots of lawn-chairs and chairs surrounding the pool, which is 1.5m at the deep end. The pool connects with the Gym area. Self-serve laundry machines are on site if you need them. There were only 1 or 2 however so don't leave your laundry until the last minute! To do a full cycle of laundry will cost you about $9 USD, unless you bring your own detergent, which would reduce it to $6. I believe you can swipe your room key to pay the fee.

I always associate this hotel branch with suburban and airport locations. But this location can be great for budget travelers. That that it's a budget hotel by any means, but it's just a great value. First, while this is a very nice hotel with a pool, it is NOT a resort. So if you need in hotel choice of restaurants, several pool options, etc, pick a different hotel. But it also doesn't have any of those annoying ""Resort Fees"" that so many of the other Waikiki hotels charge. So the rate you booked, is the rate you pay. Also, it includes the standard Hyatt Place breakfast buffet. While not fancy, it is a full breakfast (not just bread products and coffee), which adds a ton of value as well.The location is great, while not right on the beach, it is only a block away and I did still have an ocean view from my room on the 17th floor. And there are tons of shopping and dining options within a couple of blocks.The standard Hyatt Place rooms are huge, so you and your family get a lot more room to spread out. And they are very modern and clean. With desk area, huge sectional sofa and mini fridge. The large flat screen TV has tons of channels and the free Wifi was very fast and reliable. They have more power outlets in the room than you will know what to do with (including 4 total outlets above the nightstands on either side of the bed, YAY!). The split bathroom is modern, clean and functional, with the vanity separate from the shower and toilet.If you do need to park a car, valet is the only option and it's $30/day (plus tips). But if you just want to explore the Waikiki Beach area, you really don't need a car at all.

Staff here was really friendly and helpful. Hotel is close to the beach, Honolulu zoo, Waikiki Aquarium, and bus stop. Stayed here three nights before going on an Hawaii cruise, then stayed again for four more nights after the cruise. I had requested an early check-in for the second stay, they said they would try but no guarantee since it depended on availability. We got to the hotel around 10 a.m. and we were able to check-in. (Hooray, since we needed the rest and need to do some laundry.) The only draw back to this place is where they serve breakfast. It's on the third floor, outside deck. There are pigeons that are looking to eat your food. They did have warning signs on the table. Breakfast was good, except for the pigeons, so someone has to be at the table to keep them away.

Check in was very quick and easy. we were on the 11th floor facing Waikiki Beach. The hotel is about 2 blocks from the beach. From our room we had a view of the ocean and Waikiki Beach area, but due to the hotel being a few blocks back there are some taller hotels and buildings around that block most of the view, not a big deal for us though. The balcony would be the only downfall I think to this room, very small, there was a small side table and two chairs but the size of it was around 2ft by 5ft. Very little noise from our room as well. The room was smaller then what we are used to in a Hyatt Place but we expected coming in that the room would be smaller, again no big deal. Big shower, plenty of towels, very very comfy bed. The free breakfast wasn't bad for free breakfast, very very busy at times with minimal seating, the two times we had breakfast at the hotel we took it to our room. Valet was $30 a night(24hr) and I thought we worth it. A nearby hotel we were told may have $20 a night parking, but the convenience of having our car quick was worth the extra to park at the hotel, valet guys were extremely fast and nice. Overall we had a great trip staying at this hotel and would recommend it to anyone looking for a very nice hotel that is cheaper then most in the area for what you get. Staff was A++++++ the entire time, very helpful and friendly. Free wifi, free breakfast, free beach towels.",,bjohnson4406,10,4.0

There are hardly any hotels that are right on Waikiki Beach. This hotel is about 2 blocks from the beach. It is literally a 5 minute walk to Waikiki Beach. If you are not feeling the beach, then head to the great shopping that is just down the road. You will find many high stores like Tory Burch, Coach, Ralph Lauren, Louis Vuitton and more. There are also great restaurants located near the hotel that are with in walking distance. We did not have a rental car so we walked everywhere we went, even from our hotel to Diamond Head and back! Many of our walks were when it was dark and we felt completely safe. Ok, now about the hotel itself! This is an awesome resort with a great staff. Breakfast is served every morning at 6:30am. There are good selections for breakfast. Rice, miso soup and different Asian toppings were served at breakfast also. Fresh fruit was there daily! Breakfast is served on the 3rd floor and most seats are outside. Birds will fly down and peck at your food if you leave the table with food on it. Our room was on the 12th floor. There are 2 towers and the tower we were in has smaller rooms than the other tower. We did not mind this because we had a great view and were not in it very long each day. The rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet. Free WiFi is provided by the resort. My only downside to this hotel is the pool. It is located on the 3rd floor and not very big. However, we were there for the beach and not the pool. The workout facility is on this floor too. There are plenty of treadmills, bikes, elliptical's & dumbbells to get a great work out in. Gym towels were provided and so was water. There were 2 TV's that you could watch. On some of the machines they had individual tv's. We never went to the lobby bar but there is one that looked like it had good liquor and beer choices. One service they provide that we used was a local expert there for any questions. We went to her for several questions and was very helpful about telling us where to each, visit, etc. All in all this is an awesome hotel. It is an ideal location, clean and great staff! The staff was very warm with their greeting and texted us to check on our room when we arrived. This is your hotel for Waikiki Beach! When we return to Waikiki we will definitely stay here.

""I need a beach towel"", ""Here you go"". It was great that I did not have to trade a card to get a towel. I loved the level of trust. Friendly staff: Staff went above and beyond to make the stay great. Knowing that we have an infant, they honored our request for the king bed.Parking:Valet parking was a good option.

I cannot stand a hotel that over-charges because it has a restaurant that serves a mediocre dinner, this is not the case with Hyatt Place, they offer breakfast, but not lunch or dinner. You can get take-out sandwiches and salads from their market place. It does not charge a resort fee for things that should be included. Wifi, workout room, pool towels, and breakfast was included in the nightly rate. The breakfast had several basic hot choices that varied daily, like pre-prepped eggs, waffles, french toast, and always offered cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, cottage cheese, bread, bagels, jam and peanut butter, as well as, Miso soup and kimchi, coffee, tea, and juice. I eat wheat-free and was able to do so and still have a hearty breakfast. I had the Diamond Head view room, with a King bed and lanai. The room was small, but it was more important for my room to be updated and clean, and it was! It was also very quiet. I would make sure you are not in a room at the front of the hotel if you're looking for quiet and are a late riser. In Waikiki, the streets are narrow and often packed with early morning tour buses. Elevators were very quick.Great bar for Happy hour. A tour desk is available if you need it. The beach is one block away.I stayed 5 days and had a rental car from the airport. It is very difficult to park a car in Waikiki and I had to park across the street, as the hotel parking was sold-out. The parking, across the street was cheaper and I felt very safe. We did travel around the island, but a car was unnecessary for longer than 2-3 days.

As you may see I have stayed here on a few other trips and really like the place. I wanted to review again as there was a situation that occurred that would test any hotel to maintain a high level of service. I flew in on Monday and landed around noon. I headed to the office and worked a half day. When I checked in around 6:00 p.m. I was thanked for my loyalty (platinum level Hyatt) and then told that power would be out that evening from 9:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m. The staff apologized and said that it was a last minute transformer repair issue and there was nothing they could do. I asked what that would exactly mean. I was told that the only power available would run elevators and room keys (electronic locks). Usually, this wouldn't really bother me but I actually was planning on leaving for work at 5:00 a.m. as I had to prepare for a big meeting. I asked if it would affect hot water and they said ""unfortunately yes, we do have a battery powered lantern you can use though"". I'm not sure if they had one for all guests, but they gave me one. They apologized again and I said it would be no problem, but expected some compensation. I negotiated for a good deal of points, as I am a platinum member and do this regularly. I charged my cell that afternoon and true to their word, power went out at 9:00 p.m. My cell alarm went off at 4:15 a.m. and power came on around 4:30 a.m. I did have a cold shower but it was kind of refreshing due to the lack of air conditioning all night. I feel the staff did a good job with a situation that is tough. I confirmed that it was a last minute power outage scheduled by the city as our company had employees assisting with equipment shut down and restart on the facility. The rest of the trip went well. My room wasn't as high up as usual but I did book a week out, so I understood. The only complaint was the lack of coffee early Tuesday morning due to the blackout, but that was understandable.

Unfortunately the hotel has a beautiful deck area that is dominated by plastic breakfast tables which could otherwise include a nice outside sitting and bar area. The pool is in the same area and unfortunately it's utilitarian in design and feel (it could be at a Motel 6 on the I5) and the surrounding patio area is missing anything that brings a tropic feel to the space. Again, a pleasant enough hotel and one that's probably ideal for people who don't want to spend a great deal of time at the hotel as it's functional, clean but not really a contributor to great holiday memories.","Richmond, Canada","Jedavan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Canada</strong>",35,3.0

Following a recent remodel, the room was wonderful. Everything was very modern....comfortable new beds, wide screen TV, nice furniture, updated bathroom (though a little small) and nice balcony furniture. There were two lanais, one off the main living area and one off the bedroom.....both with peek-a-boo views of the ocean. The view was actually quite nice for being a block off the beach. As far as convenience goes, it was great! Only a short walk to restaurants, bars, shops and the beach. The pool is pretty small, but it wasn't crowded....and it was in the sun, which isn't always the case with facilities located in the heart of town.

We were assisted by a lovely lady (Anne-Marie I think?) and she did try to assist us by offering us a room on the 2nd floor with no view that was available straight away.

This hotel was more like a European pension or Best Western. The room was standard, despite being told it was ""upgraded."" But it was large and had a nice sofa. The beds were comfortable, something for which I've come to rely on in a Hyatt. We were given earplugs, which were necessary as sirens blared periodically.Regarding breakfast, the manager should be made to eat the eggs every day until the quality is acceptable. Everything else at breakfast seemed to come out of an astronaut's survival kit. At least you can count on the Miso soup and kimchi. As for the breakfast seating (on the pool deck), it's been extremely windy and there is no indoor seating. I wanted to have a relaxing breakfast but unfortunately felt like I was in a wind tunnel. When my husband lifted his elbows from the table it threatened to topple. The table top wasn't attached to the base securely, either, and we had to hold it down for fear that it would fly away, too. The hotel staff was pleasant though. I recommend the Hawaiian Prince or the Sheraton Princess.","Fairfax, California, United States","JessicaS60</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fairfax, California, United States</strong>",37,3.0

We have stayed in many Hyatt Place hotels and found them to be the best value for quality as compared to Holiday Inn Express, Hampton, etc. it's a step above - especially for breakfast opportunities (if you don't mind the pigeons when you eat outside). And we like a walk-in-shower. But the rooms are basic. We requested in advance the ocean view and were given a room on the 16th floor. You don't have a 180-degree view of the ocean without obstruction - two hotels cut out a piece of the view. Expected when you're paying $300/night in prime time. I don't like having to pay $25/night to park the Harley I rented for 4 days - but that's in line with others. And you'll pay $30 for a cab getting to and from the airport. The location is great in my opinion. Right near the Harley rental. And Diamondhead Park and the zoo are right nearby. So are a ton of restaurants and good 'ol ABC variety stores for water and snacks for the room. The walk to Waikiki Beach Park is a block. The service from front desk to room service was great. Tory was the guy assigned on our text message service and he took great care of us. Just text the assigned number.

My first stay was at the tower facing the diamond head, on the corner and the building does feel a bit different unlike the usual Hyatt Place layout. This one has a tub / shower combination and lots rooms include a small living room. Another room was located on the tower adjacent to the check in desks, which feels newer with the studio-like setting, and it comes with the washlet but the bathroom were VERY small. Not even a room for tissue holder. (Sinks are outside the bathroom). AC units are different too. One of the AC was those wall mount units that leaked water and went directly on top of my shirt and another one was the one we commonly seem at modern hotels.The breakfasts were enough but unremarkable. There are a small pool on the lounge level too but everyone seems to go to beach to enjoy more. Washer/dryer available as well as a small gym. Friendly staffs, Lawson (convenience store) on site too.

The room and linens were lovely and clean and well presented. After arriving in Waikiki and making an informed comparasion of hotels I can say that this hotel at $300/night is well overpriced and you should look else where for better value. The breakfast is not worth paying for (some of the food was unrecognisable) and the resort fee didnt cover parking which is $30/day. The pool area is not at all attractive and needs upgrading.

Free wifi, great buffet breakfast included on a lovely rooftop balcony and a phenomenal location a stone's throw from the beach. What more could you ask for?Rooms are clean, a tad small but who spends any time in the room anyway while in Waikiki? If you are a seafood lover, I highly recommend eating dinner or lunch at Tiki's bar & grill just next door at the Aston Waikiki beach hotel. Their seafood is so fresh, it's unbelievable. The Hyatt place also provides beach towels that you can exchange any time of day. It's worth it to do valet parking because if you opt to do self-parking, they can't guarantee you will find a parking spot at all times of day - it's limited. They have a great happy hour in the lobby too.Overall, had a wonderful stay at the Hyatt Place Waikiki!","Toronto, Ontario","Surfer_Chick_Patty</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Ontario</strong>",31,5.0

He really helped us get the most out of our week stay in Waikiki.Negatives - The pool - it was a complete and utter joke! Having said that who needs a pool when Waikiki beach is just down the street.Breakfast - the only complementary thing I can say about the complementary breakfast is don't go to it. I have seen better behaved children eating free food.

The pool is a rather small hotel-pool, but ok for small children to play after having been to the beach. The hotel itself is located about 2 blocks from the beach, easy walking distance.

We had stayed in this hotel 7 years ago and chose the same location (now under Hyatt) again because we loved it the first time. The renovation has made it unrecognizably fancy; it's much more efficient, refined, comfortable, and beautiful. We had a standard city view room but the balconies are placed in such a way that can get a glimpse of Diamond Head as well as the beach if you're on the 7th floor or higher (though, I guess it'll depend on which tower your room is). Here are the positives:1. Spacious rooms with new furniture, a little fridge, and coffee-maker inside.2. Bathroom was also spacious and with shower (yay!)3. Breakfast is included (buffet type of breakfast) and they do offer a great variety of food and drinks.4. The hotel is very conveniently located--close to the beach (just a block away), close to casual restaurants, close to downtown (about a 15-min. walk), close to bus stops (in case you decide to travel around the island using public transportation), close to a couple of fast food places (in case you need a snack).5. Staff works hard to make your stay nice and we appreciated the kindness.6. Bus 22 stops down the street and it can take you to Hanauma Bay. it's a must to go there and spend a day snorkeling).7. Lot's of night life around.8. The beach can get crowded (dependent on the season, I guess) but you can always walk about 2.5 miles north and find more secluded beaches.9. Internet IN the room (yay!).I can go on and on but I hope that gives you the picture. My ONLY negative and recommendation to the hotel is to have the bottled water they provide in the room free of charge. It felt ridiculous that in a high end hotel (not inexpensive), 2 small bottles of purified water will cost 3.50 each.We stayed there at the beginning of January and the temp was between 74 and 83F--not bad at all!All in all, we loved our stay in the hotel and Waikiki!

Here are some comments starting with the negative. Understandable dynamic (high) pricing for this period of time but considering the terrible experience, we felt ripped off. 2 elevators for the entire tower, seriously? We ended up waiting a very long time for elevators. In many cases the elevators were full when they did arrive. These are also quite small elevators and when filled with a stroller makes for more inconvenience and annoyed passengers. At one point, I called down to ask if the elevator had broken, the response was that it was working just fine (but in fact had broken) and the operator suggested I take the stairs. Thus, we ended up taking the stairs regularly carrying an infant, stroller and bags. Valet was challenging with a short driveway and apparently far away parking thus car retrieval took some time. The property was quite far from the beach. Breakfast area was over capacity so we ended up standing (noting infant) and fighting with birds. End with the positive. Customer service was great. They went out of the way to compensate for the terrible facilities.","Palo Alto, Ca","Darren K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palo Alto, Ca</strong>",2,2.0

The rooms were very spacious and clean. My family of four lived very comfortably. If you're deciding to choose between Hyatt Place and the Marriott, I suggest Hyatt. Every room has a balcony and so does the Marriott. If you look from your balcony, you can tell the rooms are very small and tight fitted. I suggest everyone to choose the package with breakfast because trust me, that was save you lots of money when traveling in Hawaii. There was a wide selection from rice, kimchi, and miso soup to eggs, bacon, and bagels. Although everyday changes, most of the breakfast selection is the same. Because Hawaii is known for being expensive, don't just find any restaurant, because trust me, it is so pricy. There are a lot of burger places near, but if you are looking for a variety to choose from, I suggest you walk to the mall. It's not a long walk from the hotel. It's about 8 minutes away. Inside the food court, there's a lot of great foods to choose from. As of location, it's pretty decent. The walk to the beach took no longer than five minutes. Although the beach is ""right there"", I suggest you walk a little bit further away because the beach that is right in front of you has rocks at the bottom and not sand. Also, if you plan on doing tours, the walk from the hotel to the bus pickup is also no longer than a five minute walk. Overall, the service was great and everyone was friendly.

We would definitely recommend this place, here are the reasons:Pros: location: The hotel is about a 3 to 5 minutes easy walk to the beach at the corner of Kuhio and Paoakalani. Almost all the hotels except for a few are not directly on the beach. Kuhio beach is blocked off by a wall, the water is very calm. It is located at the end of Waikiki near Diamond head, still within easy walking distance to most of the shops and restaurants. The hotel directly across from a bus stop where you can take buses to Ala Moana shopping center, Pearl harbor and downtown. Free breakfast: It has one of the best free breakfast offered by a hotel in the US! There are hot items such as half breakfast sandwich or break meat(sausages or bacon) and eggs; and one of the followings: pancakes, waffles or french toast. There are also cereals, yogurt and fresh fruit as well as a couple breakfast pastries. To cater for the Asian tourists, they always have miso-soup, rice, kimchees and tofu as well. They also offer several fruit juices, coffee and hot water for tea, One of the reasons we booked this hotel was for the free breakfast and we were very satisfied with the quality of the breakfast. While some reviewers complain that there are no too many items to choose from, I disagree. Many hotels in Asia offer a very extensive free breakfast, it is not the case in the U.S. This hotel definitely has one of the best free breakfast in the country if not the best. If you are traveling with a family of four, you can save $50 every day just on the breakfast. Some reviewers have mentioned that the seating area of the restaurant is not big enough, I also disagree, we always find seats. The hotel staffs do a good job cleaning quickly. You can also use a tray in the room to take the breakfast to the room. Free coffee is available in the lobby in the morning. Free Wi-Fi: it is easy to connect to the internet while you are in the room. That also saves you a lot of money. There are 10 or 15 computers available in the lobby if you do not have your own computer. Room: The room we had was big with a separate sitting area. There are two TV's, one in the main area and the other is in a separate sitting area. There is also a couch. Our room is on the fifth room with a wrap around balcony. While there's not much view, we are also far away from any other buildings near by giving us total privacy. We put our wet snorkeling gears and wet bathing suits in the balcony, they are usually dried by the time we are back from dinner. We never had to use A/C once while we were there. We left the sliding door open, the wind we had at night was enough to keep it cool. You can hear some traffic noise, so do ask for a room in the higher floors. Convenience stores: There are two stores, Lawson which is on site and the ABC store that are 2 minutes away. They open till midnight. They have everything you need, tooth paste, lotion, snacks, sandwiches, sushi, drinking water, soda, beer, sandals, beach towel, beach mats, buoys, snorkeling gears, swimming goggles, souvenirs...etc. The ABC stores are everywhere throughout Waikiki, you can never be more than 10 minutes from an ABC store when you are in Waikiki. There's only one super market in Waikiki, it's called Food Pantry. It is located on Kuhio near Seaside, about 10 to 15 minutes walking distance from the hotel. The ABC store is also the place to buy the 4-day bus pass ( $30). Staffs: The hotel staffs are very friend and efficient.Tourist desks: They have two desks, one for English speaking customers and the other is for Korean and Japanese (?) customers. Cons: Swimming pool: It is very small. If you plan on lounging by the pool all day long, this is not the hotel for you.Tours: The staff at the tour desk recommends some island tours that are much more expensive than the ones you can find online. Do your research, before making your decision. You can also take a bus to many places, depending on how much time you have, you may want to consider this option. Overall, this is a very good hotel.

The pool was out when we went and access to the other Hyatt given however the beach is 2 minutes away so wasn't that bad. Would have like the option of a swim in a pool though as not that keen on the sea.. The shop was stocked well albeit a little expensive however it still had a great choice. The room was kept clean and the cleaner was a fantastic women who was so friendly. She even held back one day until we left our room (jet lag) around 4pm. The free breakfast was a nice option as nearly everywhere in Waikiki is expensive. The options are basic however it is enough to get you by. The lift is a nightmare and we often walked it took that long. Most of the guests exchanged that awkward look that said is this actually every going to come? The location of the hotel was really good. Not on the beach but crawling distance and plenty of attractions close by from shopping to the Zoo. The parking was a bit of a nightmare. It was limited and very expensive. TBH we probably didn't even need the car however it was a nice option at night.

Hyatt Place offers 24/7 options for food but normally you have to always go down to the lobby and pick it up. This property offers room service for only an additional $3 surcharge which is great. The bistro menu is basically the same as other Hyatt Places with a few local type offerings.Breakfast is included and is served in the outside pool area on the 3rd floor. The offerings were the same as most other Hyatt Places – Egg Sandwich (open-faced), assorted cereals and breads, juice coffee, etc. The staff is phenomenal, I usually take soy milk in my coffee and Sonia was prompt in filling this request even though there were a lot of breakfast patrons. Also because there is a large Asian tourist population, soups are also offered at breakfast. The only issue I had with the breakfast space is with the number of birds that are present since it is outside.

We had originally reserved a Mountain View room with two queen beds. Upon checking- in, we were upgraded to a larger room (same view) that also included a sofa bed.

Room highlights included two comfortable queen beds, a large flat-screen TV, a mini-fridge and two small balconies. Finally, the hotel had no resort fee and offered valet parking for $30 per night.Amenities: The fitness center was a good size for this hotel and never crowded. The pool was on the small side with no view. Fresh pool/beach towels were available (free of charge) at the pool. We only used the pool once, but had it to ourselves. Breakfast offered a selection of hot items (that changed daily) as well as a selection of fruit, cereals, breads, pastries, etc. Tea, coffee, milk and various juices were also available.

The staff and housekeeping team were friendly and helpful. Our room, though on the small side, had everything we needed. And, being on the top floor (14th) corner, we had a small bit of an ocean view from the balcony. Meanwhile, you may or may not like the location. We had no trouble with its being away from the high-end retail stores and the 2-block walk to the beach. However, we were not so impressed with the number of homeless cruising this stretch of Waikiki, though it was not the hotel's fault. Breakfast buffet was excellent. We were usually the first bunch to eat when they opened. The choices and the quality of the food were the best that I had seen in free hotel breakfasts. We actually returned for a quick ""second breakfast"" on two occasions after swimming / hiking. The one mild discomfort was about the air conditioner.

The room was small but well designed and furnished - not cramped at all. Furnishings and fixtures were new, clean, attractive and wifi was strong. Breakfast (free is my favorite) had a little of everything - eggs, bacon, pancakes, hot cereal, yogurt, granola, pastries, a variety of juices, coffee, tea and staff members chasing the birds away from the tables. The beach is a minute away. Hardcore Waikiki also a short walk away. Our room was 5th floor mountain view -- can't really see much but the hotel is on the quiet side of Waikiki and there was very little noticeable street noise.","Oahu, Hawaii","dpc786</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oahu, Hawaii</strong>",14,5.0

The staff were so friendly and also so helpful ESP at 3am in the morning when your hungry you can easily order from the 24/7 restaurants in the lobby. WIFI is awesome very fast and no lost signals! Must admit the breaky wasn't that great but it's still good enough. With the usual juices , breakfast breads etc. This hotel is so close to the local ABC STOre WHICH IS SO HANDY! Close to the local bus that takes you to ala Moana shopping centre (pink line) only costs $2 pp just watch out for the tree branches when riding rooftop. Close to the beach just minute walk literally. You can organise shuttles to the shopping outlets or tours anywhere through the hotel, they are very fast and efficient. The Polynesian culture centre bus pick up is just across the road from the hotel which was handy. Clubs and pubs are walking distance. Even though your not ocean view you can easy just walk down to the beach and watch sunrise or sunset. The hotel room is the best! The beds are so soft and also the pillows are also soft which makes you night so peaceful! I loved it! Showers are good and also bathroom. The room service is always helpful and will assist in any way! In the future I will be staying here every time I come to hawaii! Trust me you get what you pay for at this hotel!

While it is an older hotel, it is well appointed and the rooms are fairly up-to-date. That said, it isn't a top-tier resort like some of the other places (e.g., Hilton Hawaiian Village, Marriott Waikiki and so on). It is a good place for those who want to enjoy Waikiki outside and use their room as a place to rest.We didn't use the pool/ fitness room, but the free breakfast was quite nice and the hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. Given the value, we really enjoyed the stay/ location and so on. But the big demerit: the elevators, especially in the Pali tower were just over-matched. It was easier to take the stairs ten floors than wait for the glacial progress of the lifts. Quite a shame given all the other nice points of the hotel.

We really enjoyed the hotel as a base to explore Waikiki. We were initially put in a room on the 2nd floor on the street side above the Lawson convenience store as this was all they had. We asked to be moved as soon as possible due to the noise on the main road. The next day we were moved to a room on the 6th floor on the same street side. The noise level was much better, but was still slightly noticeable.Overall, both rooms were spacious, modern, and clean. Our king-sized bed was very big and very comfortable. I felt the bathroom shower could have done with some modernisation but this was a minor gripe (it was too close to the toilet). Wifi was included in the room which was a big plus.Breakfast was also included. Guests were able to take the tray from their room and use this to take breakfast back to the room. I did this each day as the breakfast space was very busy and not that large. It was also outside in the heat which was quite unbearable even under the shade.The location was great being a short walk to the beach (less than 5 minutes). The hotel had a Lawson convenience store in the building and there was an ABC store 2 minutes walk away. There were also plenty of restaurants nearby.Overall this was a good hotel for a good price. Whilst it lacked the wow factor of our stay in the Hilton Waikiki at the end of our stay (with view of the beach), we still had a nice time here and would recommend it as a good middle range hotel.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Brad_Herbert</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",350,4.0

We booked this hotel many months ago for a vacation in late October. The price was competitive and the reviews were mostly positive. We stayed 9 nights and overall, the stay was pleasant. Check-in was a breeze, the staff make you feel welcome and are always kind. They were more than accommodating for any issue. Some reviewers mention spacious rooms. Ours wasn't. We stayed in the east tower. If you want to see the ocean, you have to be above the 10th floor. Elevators are slow. Our room was very clean and the staff did an excellent job with maid-service. Our room was very dated, with popcorn ceiling in the bedroom area. The entry and the bathroom areas have been updated although there is only one switch for the vanity / sink area and the shower / toilet room. This can be annoying for the partner trying to sleep if you need light in the shower / toilet area only.Breakfast is very average. Hot foods are warm. I saw about 7 different ways to prepare an egg sandwich. They always served some form of meat product. It is a zoo and feeding frenzy around 7:30 - 9:00 am. Come early for a good seat and if it's raining, opt for breakfast somewhere else. The birds are annoying, but that's the price you pay for outside dining.We had a great view from our room on the 14th floor. Yes the Aston and Marriott block some of the view, but there was enough water to make you feel tranquil while sipping coffee on the lanai. By the way, Their coffee was great!!!

The only negative was that they came in to clean the room anytime between 10am and 4pm. No two days were the same.

It consists of two towers which are connected by a common area which contains the main lobby, lounge areas, business center, a cafe and and bar. The hotel appears to have been recently renovated since every is fresh and clean. The Japanese convenience store Lawson station is great because it has a great selection drinks, snacks and sushi/sashimi and a really great price. We ended up getting some water and sod to keep in our mini bar since hotel actually charges $3.50 if you drink the bottled water they provide. The room I felt was bit on the smaller side however it was well laid out with a small balcony. The free breakfast was more than adequate with a good selection of cereals, waffles and muffins and juices, served in a really wonderful outdoor patio.

HotelClub had a special deal, so this room was at a very good price. We did get on level 9 in an ocean view in the 1st tower (not sure of the tower name) however the view was enjoyed from a small window over the desk, you would need to stand t the desk to actually see the view. Needless to say it was not what I expected for what was supposedly the best category of room. Went back to reception to advise that the room wasn't what I expected & they did move us to the Diamond Head Tower in a room with a decent ocean view. Why they put us in the other room in the 1st place when the other room was available annoyed me a little, but I was happy with the next room that we moved to. The room was a good size, with a small lounge area. The staff were very good & friendly. The included breakfast was decent, we only need toast, cereal, coffee & juice. There were a few hot options as well - eggs, sausages etc. the hot options seemed to change daily when we were there. We had to leave very early for our return flight, so we were able to pack some breakfast items & get some coffee to go & eat on the way to the airport.We had no issues with the speed of the included wifi, there are also computers in the lobby with printing so handy for online check-in.The pool is very small & didn't look like it would get a lot of sun. The beach less than 5 mins walk is great, it is sheltered from waves so very family friendly. Reception provide towels to take to the beach. The rooms have small fridges so good for drinks & snacks. There is the standard ABC store on the corner & also a few stores in the lobby area. We had a car for 1 night & the parking was full, however we were directed to Banyan Tree directly across the road which ended up being cheaper at $15 with in/out priviliges, whereas the hotel charges $25.We were very happy with Hyatt Place and would stay again without hesitation.

There is an ABC store a half block away that has most of what you'd need in terms of supplies -- some groceries, soda/pop, beer, souvenirs, milk & cream, etc., which makes the in-room fridge a great feature.Both valet & self-parking are available at rates that might seem steep but are competitive for Waikiki.

Breakfast is free and is pretty good, lots to choose from and a good selection of cereals, toast, pastries and hot food that changes daily. It is served on the 3rd floor next to the pool and I loved sitting outside for breakfast although there is a small covered area if preferred. There is also free wifi throughout the hotel. There are standard amenities in your hotel room including a decent hair dryer and the hotel has many more available through reception if you forget anything, most free some for a very small fee. I thought the rooms were a tad small because there isn't really anywhere we could ut our suitcases but I loved the balcony. We were upgraded from a city view room to a mountain view room on the 5th floor but as we couldn't really see the mountain I wouldnt bother upgrading. Other than the girl who checked us in we found the staff to be very friendly and their service was fantastic especially Ted the bell hop and the housekeeping staff. There is also a pool and a guest laundry both located on the first floor if you wish to use them :)As for the location it is only 2 blocks to the beach which was brilliant. We went to the beach atleast once a day. There is a bus stop right outside and pickups for most tours across the road. We didn't have access to a vehicle but we found the public transport very handy. Its only a short walk to many great restaurants and shopping. We stayed here 6 nights and on leaving it was no problem for the hotel to look after our bags (our flight wasn't till 10pm) and we were also offered the use of a hospitality room which was unexpected and made a huge difference :). Due to a hiccup with our flights we found ourselves staying in Hawaii an extra 2 nights so we decided since we had enjoyed our first stay to return to the Hyatt Place where it was not at all a problem to book in for another two nights.

This hotel was quite different from the other Hyatt Place’s we have stayed at. For one it’s a high rise. Our room was large and appeared to be remodeled. Very large and may be considered a step above a regular room. The view was another matter. The line from a song came to mind, “they tore down paradise and put up a parking lot” In front of us was three high rises, below was a private bungalow with clothes hanging on a line. Strange to see this smack in the center of all these high rise hotels. In fact to be perfectly honest, each high rise blocked the next from any chance of a view. Forget the water. We went for breakfast the next morning only to be shocked at the area they put this in. The pool is the size of a backyard pool for a family of 6. The food area appears to be stuck on a roof with private apartment buildings surrounding the area. Our view was of the adjoing balcony’s, that had stacks of storage boxes, trash and clothes lines. What a letdown for a Hyatt. I know they can’t do anything about the private apartments but they should find another area to have their breakfast service. That evening we choose to just eat in the Hotel and sat down at the bar. The bartender poured a taster of the house wine. I tasted it, sat the glass down and stated it was fine. She pulled the unfinished glass and poured it out. The service just went downhill from there. We did get our food, and I ordered a second glass of wine since she was there. She poured a fresh glass then grabbed my un finished one. We told her to put it down, I explained to her she should ask if the customer was finished before removing their glass. She said no one has ever complained and that’s the way it was done. After not seeing anyone to help us customers got up and left. Some still owed for their meals and stated they would pay at the desk. When the male helper returned he apologized stating he was valeting cars. So I gather from that they have no permanent help in the restaurant/bar area. This might work at the other Hyatt Places, but this one is far too big to manage it like they are. The hotel manage did attempt to contact us. We tried to meet with him at the desk. None of this happened. So hopefully they will straighten this out with their staff. Would I visit this hotel again? Not by choice. This was a business trip.","Henderson, Nevada","SVANTHOFF</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Henderson, Nevada</strong>",8,2.0

There are many positives and fewer negatives however I dont suggest booking the top room unless of course your booking the penthouse as it seemed everyone was being upgraded due to a 'celebration holiday' I do regret paying for the top category, after all your not spending too much time in the room. DO ask for a floor above 10 if your not big on street noise. btw this goes for anywhere in Waikiki not just here. Here are my pros and cons below:Pro's: staff are nice and friendly, very polite and helpful. Free wifi as mentioned.Lobby is clean and tidy.Beach is a five minute walk if that.Rooms are large, clean and modern considering they are not suites they have more space than many. All rooms come with a fold out sofa too, although we didnt use it, my 2 yo loved having it out with his toys cars during the day. The TV was big, bathroom clean and well equipped and the full length skinny mirror was a bonus.Tour desk (Expedia) are helpful and honest.Lots of towls and face washers, soaps etc were left every morning at our service. The maids weteClean and reasonably priced cafe/ bar downstairs.Free coffee in the morning between 6.30 and 9.30amLobby is a pretty place to sit and people watch waiting for your friends.Air con in room is great but the Fan is loud, I actually love the white noise to go to sleep.Cons:Stinky sushi outlet/ convenient store 'Lawsons' downstairs in the lobby, the smell after a few days makes you feel sick.No robes in roomThe pool is not worth mentioning unless you want to literally dip before going out and shuts at 10pmNo bar at pool level.Breakfast is plain rank, everything to eat is just yucky! Stale cereal, fatty egg patties, greasy cheese, soggy fruit, sweet breads and sugary pastries. If you are at all health conscientious do not even bother looking, and don't even think of finding anything carb free. (Juice is fine, apple, tomato and oj)The lift beeps loudly on every floor, so annoying staying on the 19th floor!Birds everywhere and all over your table on 3rd level during coffee/ breakfast timeYes a few cons in my opinion however I would stay here again, just in a cheaper room. For the staff and cleanleness and size of room plus having free wifi is still great value.

Its five of us so we reserved a room with partial ocean view, 2 queen beds and one sofa bed. It did suffice and the view was actually very nice. I liked that the internet worked fine, no trying to connect again and again because of weak signal. I had read that in some parts of the building the rooms are very small but fortunately this wasn't the case. Some amenities were lacking such as a shower cap, sewing kit. We got shampoo, conditioner and soap just once. Also the room had only one trash can. For extra blankets you need to ask the front desk as there are none in the room. Apart from this it was clean, I saw no mildew or such.Waikiki is very noisy so even though the windows are well sealed you will hear some noise from the streets, but nothing major. You also get the complementary breakfast which has some decent items in it.What stands out about this place is that its close to the beach (a couple of minutes walk) and the friendliness of staff. A lot of people and tour parties are coming and going from the Hyatt and yet personnel is always nice and ready to help.This is a good hotel for a middle ground budget. I would recommend not ordering food there if you are on a budget.

We would highly recommend this hotel.While not directly on the beach it is a very easy walking distance making the value tremendous as compared to the beachfront properties. With the higher cost of airline travel, the higher per night lodging cost and the mandatory resort fees at most hotels this is a great value. We booked through the Hyatt Hotel travel partner that resulted in a great price, by Hawaii standards, for the room and airfare.Our deluxe ocean view room was large with a nice seating area consisting of a sofa bed, chair and ottoman/coffee table adjoining the sleeping area. The bathroom was nicely appointed and the entire room was kept very clean by the housekeeping staff. Wear and tear for a high volume Waikiki property is showing in the rooms but I feel confident that management will maintain high standards.Anyone who has been to Waikiki and eaten alfresco knows that birds can be an annoyance but the staff was very good at keeping them away at breakfast. So long as you do not feed them and you do not leave your food unattended you will not have a problem.Free breakfast that is not part of a package price at a Waikiki hotel is unheard of and the Hyatt Place does it more than right. The food was fresh, always stocked, a variety of items for most anyone’s taste, the area was kept clean and it was good. Guest that complain about breakfast should realize that most properties in the area would change $20 per person for breakfast and this is free.While everyone was friendly throughout the property (the front end staff pretty much ignored guest when not directly dealing with them), special recognition is given to the housekeeping and maintenance staff for always going out of their way to be extremely friendly. In our case Wilma, who attended to our 12th floor room during most of our stay, was extraordinary. Wilma introduced herself on our first morning, constantly acknowledged us in the hallway and left a personal note on our last day thanking us for our visit and welcoming our return in the future. Wilma is certainly a great ambassador for this hotel and deserves recognition for providing exceptional service and asking for our return business.Hyatt Place is a moderately priced limited service brand that in this case provided exactly what we were looking for and more. They exceeded our expectations. If you are looking for a resort hotel with high end amenities, then this would not be a property well suited for you. If, however, you are looking for a great value, large rooms, friendly staff, free Wi-Fi that works well and free daily breakfast that is near everything for half the price of the high end hotels then you will not be disappointed.","Saint Louis, Missouri","314STL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",75,4.0

It was very reasonably priced with the free breakfast package and no hotel surcharge like some other hotels. The free in-room WIFI was also a big plus. This hotel is situated towards the end of Waikiki beach area but walking distance to the Zoo and the Aquarium. The staff are friendly and really try to please. They provide beach towels for those who like going to the beach which is half a block away. Food and shopping are close by. They have a bar and food in the lobby with happy hours every day. A concierge is available to help book excursions. We booked 5 with him and were very pleased with his recommendations and the quality of the tour companies.Our standard room had a king sized bed and plenty of room. The in-room safe was huge and had room for my 17"" laptop and my wife's purse. There was a desk and a 48"" flat panel TV. The shower and toilet were in a separate room from the vanity. The room staff made the room up every day and kept the room clean with fresh towels and sheets.The free breakfast had lots of selections with a different egg selection every day. One day they even had eggs Benedict! They changed the selection of waffles, French toast and pancakes (one per day) and rotated bacon and sausage. There was fruit, cereal, bagels, toast, oatmeal and a selection of juices and milk. You either sit outside in a reserved area or take the food back to your room with a supplied tray. There are no aggressive birds like I've read in other reviews. Some small birds do fly into this area but they mostly pick up crumbs from the ground.

Can't beat that! Could be because I'm a Hyatt Gold Member but I've read other reviews of travelers who were also given an upgrade at check in as well. Whatever the reason it was great! The hotel is not directly across the Waikiki beach which is nice because that section gets so busy with tourists and traffic. It is hidden in the back and about 3 blocks from the beach but still within walking distance to all the shops and restaurants on the main Waikiki strip. The room was very spacious and clean and the queen size beds and pillows were very comfortable, even the pull out bed that my 6 year old got all to himself. As a mom traveling with children I am very picky about where we stay. My husband is also very choosy about the brand of hotels we stay at. This one did not disappoint us! It is very cleaned and well maintained. The staff are very nice and friendly and are eager to assist. There are times when they are swamped and the wait may take a while but that's a given. They have a business to run so do expect slow service at some point if they are busy. Same goes with the elevators. Several times we've had to wait for the elevators a little bit longer than the 1-2 minutes wait but never longer than 5 minutes. It wasn't a very long wait. Yes it's longer in the mornings when everyone is trying to get to breakfast on the 3rd floor. That's expected! The complimentary daily breakfast was a plus for us because it saved us money and time from having to rush out in the mornings to get breakfast. We were able to take breakfast back to our room (with the in room tray that we didn't know to take down with us the first morning but we learned quickly:-) The kids were able to eat and relax in the comfort of our room. The variety of items during breakfast was great. Hot items such as eggs, beacons, sausages, pancakes, waffles, french toasts and croissant sandwiches (need I say more?) were alternated every other day. There was plentiful of hot items every day. An array of oatmeal, cereals, yogurt, fresh fruits, muffins, bagels, toasts... there was plenty to choose from. For those reviewers who complained about the lack of breakfast items, we sure didn't see it. For being a complimentary breakfast,which is very hard to find at hotels in Hawaii, there was an abundance of food to choose from. If you are expecting gourmet breakfast food, then this is not for you. Expect more of a Denny's or Ihop type of breakfast. And we did not see any pigeon issues on the few days we ate onsite. Food on the island can get very pricey even with the ""cheap eats"" so having daily breakfast was a huge plus for us. The pool is small as with many hotels on the island (and we have been to Hawaii many times) but you don't come to Hawaii for the pools when there are miles and miles of beaches to explore. We went to the pool one time and everyday we were at the beach (Lanakai and Kailua were our top picks). The hotel offers sand toys for kids so you don't have to pack any or purchase them. Wish we had known to ask because we bought some the first day at the ABC store down the street. The free flower lei making on Fridays was a major hit for us. It was such a fun activity and the kids loved making their own flower leis.

I stayed with my mom and we truly had an unforgettable experience. The room was spacious enough to where we both easily moved around and the amenities in which I partook, while not plentiful, are typical of what you'd see in a five star hotel, but at half the price. The view of the ocean is obstructed, however you are a five minute walk from the beach so walk to the beach for an uninterrupted view! From previous reviews, I was apprehensive about the elevators, but they ran smooth as butter. My mom and I never waited more than a minute or two for them. Yes there are birds at breakfast, however you are provided with trays to take food back to your room -- and newsflash, the breakfast is free so some of the entitled attitudes I've gleaned from other reviews shouldn't be taken so seriously. I love, love love the fact you can book excursions through the Expedia Desk. Chris Barzman was a great help and assisted me almost a year before my planned stay! That is exceptional service. With the excursions, you may pay a bit more, but had I not had help, there might have been something I missed. The rest of the staff, including Ciamar and Angeline were so sweet.

Our stay didn't get off to a great start at check in when a young boy ducked in front of us and asked for a room key as he'd lost his and couldn't get access to his room. This was after midnight (not sure what this boy was doing out on his own at that hour!) and it took the desk clerk at least ten minutes to sort this issue out. In this time, nobody acknowledged us - no eye contact, no apology. We just stood there feeling very tired as our flight had been delayed from New Zealand and we just wanted to get to our room.Finally some other desk clerk came up to us, asked if we'd been looked after - we said No! She checked us in promptly but again no apology. This is so unlike Hawaii and we were quite shocked. After the bad start - everything else was great. The room was spacious, newly renovated and comfortable in every way. The bathroom was good, the bed comfortable and air conditioning worked quietly and efficently. The ""ocean view"" was a joke, but I expected that from the location back from the beach. Free wifi worked well - was speedy and easy to connect to.The free breakfast was adequate but I certainly wouldn't rave about it. It changes each day and it's just lucky if you get something that you like, especially in the hot section.

I don't think you will get any breathtaking views from this hotel because it is about a block from the beach surrounded by other tall buildings, but we did have a great view of Diamond Head and the sea from our room. Breakfast (included) is surprisingly really good and extensive. Their little pastries are so fresh and buttery! Yes, there are birds, but what can you do? The Wi-Fi was at an excellent speed as well.

The hotel has put deterents out there but there are just far too many birds out there. If you have an issue with nature then I'd say eat in your room.

There are only two elevators for the deluxe tower, but we didn't have any issues with waits. The location is very good--you're just a short walk to Kuhio Beach Park, one of the better places to swim on Waikiki Beach. It's about a 10 minute walk to the largest collection of shops and restaurants in Waikiki. We really appreciated that the Hyatt Place doesn't charge a resort fee--one of the few in Waikiki not to. When you consider that and the included breakfast, it's a better value that many hotels that initially seem to have lower rates.

They have breakfast everyday included with Starbucks coffee. It really started our day off right. The pool is small but who goes in the pool in Hawaii?!? It is a two minute walk to the beach and restaurants/stores. There is an ABC store next door which has everything you could possibly want including liquor/food/rafts. I highly suggest buying a $2.99 raft and for an extra .60 they blow it up for you and get a snorkel kit for $6.99. If you leave the hotel and walk to the beach walk left until you get to the beach cafe. There is great snorkeling that people don't know about right there!! I also did the lei making class which was fun but get there early! They have wine/cheese tasting in the bar. You can rent bikes and scooters around the corner.

The included breakfast was of good quality and variety. The coffee could be better though.There is a convenience store just off the lobby of the hotel and an ABC Store (better selection) on the next block. Quiet bar & lounge in the lobby.The not-so-good stuff-The birds in the breakfast area. Others have mentioned this and they are a bit a nuisance. The hotel has clearly tried to deal with the issue but it doesn't appear they're having much luck. I would suggest getting a cat. Guests can use the tray in their room to collect breakfast and take it back to the room if they want. I'm used to Hyatt's having very comfortable beds and fortunately my room had 2 queen beds because one of them wasn't comfortable. The air conditioner didn't cool the room very well. And there was a partial divider (probably to hide the a/c unit) that basically cut off half the room from the a/c. They could really use a fan or ceiling fan to move the cool air around. Note- this is an ocean view room on the 14th floor.Minor gripes-The popcorn ceiling in the room... makes the remodel seem pretty low budget. The paint job wasn't very good either. There were also numbers written on the tiles in the shower probably from when they were cut. Makes me wonder how thoroughly the showers are cleaned. Housekeeping did a nice job but a couple of times I went back to my room around 3PM and it wasn't ready.The pool is small and best for small kids that may not like the ocean.

I arrived around 6pm for an eight night stay and was greeted right away by Christopher, who was very nice and very helpful. Throughout my stay the staff was always friendly and attentive. The place looked nice and homey. Free wifi and breakfast with rooms.I was given room 911 with a partial ocean view, king sized standard. The hotel is not oceanfront but you could see a little bit of the ocean from my room. The room was small but not that small as others have said. I thought it was roomy enough and extremely comfortable. I was a solo traveler though too. Everything in the room was good quality. My location was extremely quiet. The only thing I did hear was at times sirens from the street at times. I never heard my neighbors and I never heard a bunch of traffic. It has it's own temperature control, a small balcony which was nice to lay my wet swimming gear out to dry daily. The bathroom was nice with a glass shower and toilet in one area and the sink located near the bathroom but not in the shower area. I liked this set up. Free safe that I used daily. Came with just soap, shampoo and conditioner. No lotion. The products were good quality and replenished daily by housekeeping. Housekeeping was nice. They normally wouldn't get to my room until around 2 or 3pm in the afternoon. I think they work the checked out rooms first that's why it was so late. They did a good job. It would have been nice to have it done by noon because that's when I would normally come back to my hotel to rest. I eventually just had them do the room up every other day since I would get kind of tired in the afternoon and wanted to rest sometimes. Hawaii is hot in August and it wears you out. The TV channels were limited and I had a hard time finding things to watch during my down time. That could definitely be improved. I've heard from other reviews that the elevators were slow but I did not experience this so I must have been in the tower with the fast elevators. You need your room card to use the elevators and mine sometimes did not work. Breakfast was the same every day with two rotating hot items. It was just okay. The one thing I liked the best about the breakfast was really the fresh fruit. Other than that it was not spectacular but it wasn't horrible either. I got up every morning to eat it because it was included, it does the job. Cereal, rice, kim shee, miso soup, cottage cheese, toast, some pastries, mini donuts, bagels, two kinds of yogurt, fresh pineapple or pineapple mixed with some melons were provided. The hot items that were rotated were scrabbled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, and a little biscuit topped with eggs on it. Drinks would include tomato, apple, orange juice and milk.I would sometimes bring extra fruit and put it in my small refrigerator for a later snack:)I did see the birds going after food a few times I went down when other people would leave their plates to go get something. The birds were aggressive and would fly over you. That was kind of gross. The last couple days I would take the tray the Hyatt provides from my room and just bring it to my room. I don't like birds.Beach towels were provided at the front but you had to check them out and then return them by given your room number you could take as many as you wanted. Some were provided near the pool as well. The pool was small and located near the breakfast area on floor three. I had wanted to use the pool but for some reason it was shutdown the two days I went to go use it. I never saw the gym area so I can't comment on that.There was a concierge on the main level if you wanted to book any fun activities. I never spoke to them but they were there everyday for most of the day. There was also, a small snack shop located near the front area by the elevators and a little store near the back elevators by concierge. The lobby area has a TV and some nice comfortable chairs, there is a small restaurant type bar that serves food and drinks. And I think there was a daily happy hour I never took advantage off.The beach was about a three minute walk and a protective walled area in the ocean so you could do some late night swimming and not worry about sharks. ABC store was a minute walk, literally. The pink trolley conveniently had a stop right in front of the ABC store, and the bus stops were also conveniently located right in front of the hotel on Kuhlio. Really nice. I used them both.This location had some wonderful food options. Just down the street about a 10 minute walk was Rainbow drive inn. Teddy's Burgers was two blocks away as was Wolf Gang Puck Express and Mee's BBQ was about three blocks away. The location was kind of far from all the action especially in the hot sun.I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would definitely recommend it to someone. I did think the location was a little too far from the places I normally like to go but that's not the hotels fault. This hotel is really nice and I think it's a safe place to stay. I got this deal off hotwire but I really wished I would have just booked direct. Hyatt offers a price guarantee on their website so if you are thinking about staying there do your price research.All and all I would stay here again if the price was right. I was not a perfect stay but I don't have a lot to complain about either. Check out was a breeze and they held my luggage for me because I had a late flight. Overall nice stay. The place was clean.","Coeur d'Alene, Idaho","Cora7777</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coeur d'Alene, Idaho</strong>",82,4.0

However, due to price gouging because it was a holiday weekend at the HR Honolulu, I elected to stay at the Hyatt Place instead. I gave it average ratings and if you are on a budget it is a good option for Waikiki as there are so many beat up run down hotels on the strip. Very few justify the prices charged on the beach so if you do not mind two blocks back and you can get a good price go for it. Here are my pros and cons:Pros:decent pricing compared to other similar hotels but shop around as this hotel goes up or down based on occupancy. They have a Hyatt bonus program for this property right now so that helps. With the 20% Diamond discount our room was around $154 a night and they do not charge the rip off resort fee so many do in Waikiki. The room was a good size and they did a decent job of remodeling the rooms from its former owners. The bed was comfortable and the move about area good. The shower/toilet worked fine and the towels were a good size. Beach towels you get downstairs for the beach. Because it is a Hyatt Place they provide free breakfast on the 3rd floor and it is typical ""motel breakfast included"" food. There is a bar and starbucks machine on the lobby level for those who want real coffee or a bar drink. The lobby area is well laid out and comfortable to hang out as I am doing now.The internet service works fine in both room and lobby.Staff really try hard to be friendly and helpful. It is very obvious that the management puts great stress on that point and thank you it is appreciated. (not the phony marketing campaign called the aloha spirit....barf)Cons:Very few rooms with any kind of view except the building next door. Being a diamond member I only got the category paid for. No upgrade but the hotel was packed for sure. We had a tiny partial view of Diamond Head.The pool really sucks. Small and not inviting. It is joined by the area set up for the free breakfast.The free breakfast was generally disgusting. Coffee was not starbucks and weak. The eggs were right out of the wholesale milk carton that so many places now use to make scrambled eggs. To me it is tough and tasteless. The bacon or sausage was microwaved and devoid of flavor. Fruit tended to be overripe and the breads mini mart quality. Cereal was fine with some standard yoghurt. All in all typical of low end motels which offer a free breakfast. You get what you pay for.Parking is a mess on the beach and the hotel charges $25 for self parking (even though their sign says $18) and $30 for valet. The hotel needs to provide a map with notes explaining where to park. The streets are one way and after driving around twice we finally saw a sign self parking but as we entered a car came roaring down the ramp. So the entry and exit are the same for self parking and no way to determine who should give the right of way. If you can get a spot at the zoo parking two blocks away it is much cheaper than the hotel. All hotels in Waikiki charge highway robbery prices to park. AC did work but it was loud and we felt you needed to have the fan on high to keep the room cool. If we opened the sliding glass door it was way too noisy and hot.

We chose a Hyatt property because we wanted to maintain our Platinum membership with Hyatt. Moreover, Hyatt Place was less expensive than Hyatt Regency. We also knew we would be hanging out at the beach more often than in the hotel, thus we proceeded with this reservation. Front desk service was good - as we'd expect from Hyatt. Yet, the housekeeping service was deplorable. For 3 consecutive stays, we found out that our room was not cleaned even after we left our room for more than 5 hrs. The housekeeping lady came by when we were in the room after we had been out twice for several hours. We asked her to come back in 10 minutes so that we could get ready to go out and let her clean. She pulled a face and snarled ""I will try to clean the room!"" . We understand that being a housekeeper is not a high paying job so, we left $5 bill on the table for her. Later on after our room was serviced, we found out that nothing was tidied up except the bed linen and towels. The $5 was gone, of course! Will we stay at Hyatt Place Waikiki in the future ? No !

However each time on our return ready to book in the ocean view room we have paid for 2 adults with 2 queen beds ( and confirmed by email 2 days before arrival) has not been available. We were given a dark ""king"" bed room and as a passing comment told is we need help with the fold out let them know. Only after complaining ( which is degrading to all parties who happen to be in reception listening) was the room type which we booked available in 4 days time ( half way through our stay). After fronting back to the reception yet again waving the confirmation email ( which they claimed they didn't know who sent) were we able to get a room with two beds for 1 night and the type we actually booked for the rest. As this has happened twice I am starting to think they just take bookings regardless of availability then hope people are so tired from their flight they will accept any room. Breakfast is included which is a bonus however most items are sugary. I feel extremely sorry for the staff as it is constantly windy so they are always having to fish out items blown into the pool and shooing away birds stealing food.

It was a trip of a life time. For the total trip price we were not expecting too much in the way of the hotel. We were so pleasantly surprised. For one thing our group had 175 people. The hotel got us checked in with no problem. The hotel lobby was large enough for us to meet as a group. It was also open air with large fans. It made you want to sit and relax. There are several small shops to get drinks, snacks, gifts and common necessities. The rooms were clean and updated a few years ago and are very tastefully decorated. The employees were supper friendly and helpful and will even take pictures with you. The ONLY thing negative is the elevator. Here in the south would say they are slow as molasses! Be prepared to walk the stairs or wait at least 10 minutes for the elevator. Remember I said it was an open air lobby? Don't forget your room key because you have to have it to use the elevator, this is for safety reasons . There is a pretty nice breakfast provided every morning. Generally the meat is the only thing that changes. Of coarse there is always pineapple. There is also asian menu items provided. The breakfast is served outside on the patio by the pool. It was wonderful to be eating pineapple in Hawaii outside! There may not always be a place to sit but they have trays so you can take your breakfast back to your room. The hotel is not on the beach but it is a very short walk...a block. There are several restaurants nearby. Tiki's, Lulu's, Wolf Gang Puck express, and Starbucks are in short walking distance.

Super close to the beach, Waikiki strip, ABC stores, restaurants, bus lines, the zoo, moped rentals (which are fantastic btw). Not much that wasn't in the hotel or a quick walk away. The gentleman that checked us in was great! We had a complicated set of reservations since it was booked using rewards points and regular payment. We ate at the gallery the first day we arrived and the food was great, pricey of course because you're in a hotel (#1) and in Hawaii (#2). That also contributes to the size of the rooms since space is so limited on the island, not sure why people coming about things that are out of one's control.We don't like using housekeeping services so I can't comment on that but the one day we did need to stock up on everything, the housekeeper was extremely friendly and organzied.The pool was fine, small yes but again that goes with space limitation. It was clean and the area was well kept. Breakfast should not be anything one complains about. They have a variety of items daily and always well stocked along with friendly staff that have to clean up after adults who think they have maids!!

Not being beachfront, there are a couple of buildings that partially obstruct the view, but we could see more than enough to get the Hawaiian 'vibe' going. The other advantage is that you can see down to the area where breakfast is served, cunningly timing things to go down when it is least busy. The second time we were on the city side with not much of a view, though a cheaper rate. Both of the rooms were big, clean and the bed very comfortable. Breakfast was included in the cost and was pretty good. Other have mentioned the pigeons and they can be pretty full-on. Don't leave food on the table unguarded. The Hotel has tried putting shiny things around to deter them, but they do not seemed bothered. Short of a golf club being issued to everyone, I'm not sure of an easy solution. One of the staff (I think his name was Fred, apologies if incorrect) was a crack shot with a squirt bottle and there did not seem to be a problem when he was on patrol.The staff were friendly and helpful with suggestions.

Being a Hyatt Place Breakfast was included. Its a giant Buffett breakfast outside by the TINY pool. This is an OLD building made pretty and new inside. BUT, this is NOT a pool hotel at all. Why pay for it with Waikiki Beach 2 walkable blocks. ABC store (like a 7-11) superstore next door for all your drink and snack needs, or souvenirs. Rent an umbrella and lounge’s or chairs on the beach for about $20 a day per person. MUCH better than just a mat or towel. DO bring beach towels from the hotel. Get them at the pool or front desk. Visit TIKI’s bar and restaurant on the beach corner (fantastic!) in the ASTON Waikiki Beach Hotel. Sit on the deck with a direct-on view of the beach, water, and waves for reasonable prices and good food. Main Waikiki bus line is across the street from the hotel and will take you anywhere in Honolulu for a few bucks.

Hotel breakfast is not exhaustive as in a 5 star but is a complete one with fruit, juices, breads, bagels, and one type of egg preparation that changes every day. Starbucks coffee rounds it off rather well, with a tray provided in the rooms to allow you the option of taking your meal to the room. Ice is available from machines in each floor. Service was very good, a jammed lock call was attended to within minutes, and cab request for airport transfer at an odd hour also on the dot.

I'm sorry, last to check in? I'd been there since 9am! She didn't even ask! Of course I told Lynne that downgrading me would not do - I come from a city, I came to Hawaii to get an ocean view, not city view, which is what I had booked and paid for months ago. She was not friendly or helpful but appeared to downgrade the last poor people who had not checked in. The room was spacious and nice. Good view - worth arguing for. Pool is a disaster, no shade and in a total wind tunnel. Didn't even bother to venture to breakfast there. Housekeeping didn't vacuum once, sometimes didn't even appear until the late afternoon. Usually did a poor job, no clean glasses etc. Waiting on the lifts was a complete joke, sometimes it'd be 15 minutes! Who's got that kinda time? Waiting for a drink at the bar in the lobby was just as bad - doesn't matter if you want a wine or a cup of tea, they'll pretend not to see you but are the thirstiest on the island for a tip.

The room was clean with a king sized bed and adequately sized. It had a stand-up shower (no tub) which worked fine for me. The internet was good but the balcony was small. The breakfast was good but these is a feeding frenzy when it opens at 630 AM. Parking is a problem (hard to get to, small slots, and fills up) at this hotel. The location is less than two blocks from the beach where restaurants and shops are.

The room appears trendy and modern. The staff was always incredibly helpful and friendly. The gym is small and limited. The pool area is small. The complimentary breakfast was good but limited.

We loved our huge room, with plenty of space for luggage, and for each person to have their own corner to rest or read. Very convenient to have the toilet separated from the sink, and nice partial view of the ocean from our ocean-view room on the 17th floor (another hotel blocked part of it).The free breakfast is a godsend for hungry kids who don't want to wait for food. We liked that it started at 6:30 AM for our jet-lagged kids who were up at 5 AM. Maybe not all the food is to everyone's taste, but there are a lot of choices. My son really liked the miso soup and rice option, as well as the usual cereal, toast, and hot choices. Coffee was really good.The pool is small and a little boring, but for little kids, it's the perfect size for a before-bed dip, and it seemed to be very popular with the under-10 set. The workout room is roomy - you don't feel like you're on top of other people like so many workout rooms in hotels. The laundry takes visa cards - no fiddling with a roll of coins to do laundry!Housekeeping was efficient and good. Front desk staff was very helpful giving out bus directions, beach towels, and ordering cabs. Free apples in the lobby, and kids get free sand toys. Fun lei-making on Friday afternoons. A quick two-block walk to a beach with a breaker, so little kids can play without fear of getting knocked over by big waves.Use Charlie's taxi service to and from the airport - very efficient.

Two towers about 20 stories high. They offer breakfast every morning like many of the Hyatt places do but they manage it well. I am an early riser (there at 6:30 am when they start) and my friend who I traveled with runs to breakfast at the last minute every day. The same offering and quality were available for us both. The food choice was pretty good, no made to order omelets but they did have scrambled eggs or some other egg omelet thing with bacon or sausage every other day with their daily offerings of fresh fruit, juices, coffee, Danish, oatmeal, cereal, pickled cucumber, white rice and kimchi. The rooms were all refurbished although be forewarned that the lowest class of rooms with the city view are really small with a fabulous shower but small. The other classes of rooms are large with the tub shower combo. We stayed in the city view for half our stay then moved to the larger rooms for the remainder. The elevators in the main tower are slow and there is only two of them. The second tower has three elevators and I like that tower better. Both have access to the third floor food area. BIG PLUSES: washing machine on the premises, lei making class on the premises. Right across the street from Marriot where everyone picks up for tours if they don’t come directly to your hotel which many do, close to the beach( Location, location, location), block and a half away, great concierge people, and housing keeping is polite and thorough.

It is still in the main downtown area, about 5 minutes walk from the beach, and 10+ minutes walk from the shopping areas. The area is level, so an easy walk. There are bus stops along the street, on the other side, so it is quite convenient, although not in the centre. If coming by car, there is a small driveway to briefly stop, and on-site parking is available for around $20/night.FRONT OF HOUSE SERVICE:The staff at the hotel were moderately helpful, assisting when asked with specific questions, but not helping beyond what was requested. For example, on check-in there were no rooms available at the time. Although we waited in front, nobody checked or advised expected waiting times, and we had to keep checking. Similarly, we had a more serious issue later on, but there was no concern or interest shown; it was a case of not being involved or assisting. As staff are dealing with tourists in a foreign city unfamiliar with local contacts and procedures, a better standard of service would be expected. ROOMS:There is a small variety of rooms. Our room was spacious, with two double beds. The rooom also had desk and chair, and sofa, a wardrobe, luggage stand, iron and board, and mini-fridge, with an LCD tv. Unfortunately, there is a very limited range of channels, with just the US networks, plus a Japanese channel. For such an international destination, it is a pity there no channels from elsewhere such as Europe or Australia, so news was narrowly focussed. All furnishings were in excellent condition. The bathroom had a shower over bath and toilet, and hair dryer, mirror and basin outside. All were in good condition and presentation. The shower head was an adequate height. Toiletries were private brand, supplied in individual packaging.The lifts are regularly mentioned in reviews. There are only two lifts to serve so many floors in the tower, so a wait is common, except at off-peak times. They're not the fastest lifts either.AMENITIES:A large lounge area is at the foyer, open to the street, which was a convenient waiting area if waiting before or after check-in. Wifi/internet access is included, with 4 public terminals and a printer near check-in. A pool and simple gym, and laundry machines are located upstairs. There is also a shop attached which sells convenience supplies, and some other shops and a cafe on the ground entry floor of the hotel.DINING: A breakfast buffet is included. There is an area seating about 50 people outside near the pool, with pigeons watching and waiting for unattended food and plates. The range of food is not great, but gives you a few choices. Each day, there is a hot option e.g. eggs, with cereal, preserved fruit, yoghurt, and a sweet bakery item. Bread, jam, Tea, coffee and juice are also available. OVERALL:A nice place to stay, which is also convenient. The hotel is well presented and maintained. Overall, I would rate it as pleasant, with everything you need. For a 4-star property though, I was disappointed in the service provided, that they didn't show interest and try to help when the opportunity presented.","Sydney, Australia","OdysseusTwo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",129,3.0

Rent a car if you go out to Dole, Sea Life Park or the Northshore as the stop and go gets old. Main stop is on Kuhio Drive right behind Lawson's at the hotel. Take the 42 as it is a more direct route to many places. Check their website. Staff was great! Room was cleaned daily. Hotel is great for families on a budget. We booked through hotels.com.

Hair dryer and iron in room with mini fridge. One cup coffee maker and in room tray was a plus. My first night went to the fire pit at night to find ... It's not on! Oh snap! The feature I was looking for and it's not turned on! Please advertise on the website when it's on ... I felt a big letdown. So my second gripe was the minuscule balcony ... Two chairs facing each other with a table. The view was nice of Leahi but the air unit was behind one chair making it very uncomfortably hot. As for breakfast, it was okay. Egg croissant and French toast. Hot and cold cereals. Variety of breads and juices. We only drank juice.I felt the complimentary coffee should be put out earlier in the lobby and at night when guest returns. We weren't able to use this service. The exercise room was nicely equipped.

Although, the hotel did it's best to fulfill my ""Quiet room"" preference. They did all they can, that's the thing. Those cons didn't outweigh benefits. Very helpful staff upon check in. - literally a slew of 20+ people from a van that offloaded just in front of me but front desk (or, Gallery Host, as they refer to themselves) quickly took next person and expedited my check in. I know why they're referred to Gallery Host because after check in, they show you around, well, the Gallery. The lobby, as most people say, is beautiful. Open air, tropical setting, public computers. Very nice. That's what I mean, elevator wait (c'mon, you're in Hawaii), age of hotel (very clean and updated rooms, what'd you expect for older part of island overrun by tourists all the time), etc. Especially accommodating was the overnight staff. I mean, I had a specific request for a specific time frame and they pulled through - Matt (Gallery Host) and Mark De Guzman (parking attendant), you know what you did! Awesome. I mean parking was either self-park (not usually available) and public parking up until midnight each night for fee as well. But, Mark, he'll take care of you. Trust me, he did for me.

So, there was a long line for the elevator at night (not something you want to have to deal with after a day out in the sun). The second hiccup was parking. When we arrived, the hotel ran out of self parking so we had to pay extra for valet parking. There is a charge for self parking, but valet is more.

In regards to parking, you can pay $20 a day for self-park or $30 for valet but we went a completely different route. A block a way from the hotel is the street parking and from 6pm - 7am its free! If you are planning on spending the day by the hotel you can move the car into the zoo's parking lot and pay $11 to keep there until 6pm then move it back to the street. This worked out for us because we took a day trip 2 out of 3 days we were there. Instead of spending $60 on parking we only spent $20 for the entire time. Another suggestion is if you are planning on spending more than 2 days on the beach I would suggest buying a beach umbrella from the ABC store ($18) instead of renting one for $20 a day from the stands on the beach.","Wilmington, Delaware","Billy G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wilmington, Delaware</strong>",3,4.0

It was a fantastic experience and we wish to share it. This hotel is convenient just a block away from Waikiki Beach. There are ample shopping and restaurants around - ABC Store and Lawson Station just right downstairs. It is a 5 minute drive to the aquarium and zoo. 15 minutes drive fro Diamond Head. Upon check in, we were told their parking garage was full ($20/day) but we can park across the street at the Waikiki Banyan for $15/day. The check in process was painless and the staff was friendly. The room we booked was a king size room that is tiny but modern and clean. Early on, we realized that the free WiFi in the room was not working. We notified the front desk twice but they couldn't find a problem. Lynn from the front desk was nice enough to offer us another room, a free upgrade, to a room that was much more spacious. The continental breakfast was satisfying with selections such as eggs, bacon, sausages, bagels, pastries, fruits, cereals, coffee, tea, juices, etc. The selection varied each day. This saved us a lot of money from having to buy breakfast each day. Watch for the birds who will attack your food if you leave it unattended. The only downside to this hotel is the small pool. Wished they had something bigger as we usually enjoy being at the pool more than the beach.Overall experience was a fantastic one. This hotel is towards the east of Waikiki. Very centralized.

In comparing the Waikiki Hyatt Place to others, several things stick out. First, the location. Hyatt Place hotels tend to be in suburban areas or near airports, away from city centers. This Hyatt Place is a quick walk from the beach and close to all the action at Waikiki. I really liked the location, which I would compare to staying a block off the Las Vegas strip. It's close enough to all the action, but you can't hear the craziness from your room. Hyatt Places also tend to be small, low-rise hotels. This one is 20 floors, affording some great views up top.Like all Hyatt Place hotels, breakfast and internet are included. I appreciated that they made the effort to provide a traditional American breakfast as well as Asian breakfast options. Breakfast was okay, on par with other Hyatt Places. Internet ran well, but it required me to re-enter the hotel-provided username and password any time my computer went to sleep.My biggest gripe at the Hyatt Place Waikiki are the elevators! There are TWO elevators for the 20-floor tower. Just two, and they're just as slow as an elevator you'd find in a five-storey building. This is a huge oversight! We were on the 15th floor and would take 3-5 minutes to get down to the lobby on packed elevators every time. The Hyatt Place brand isn't used to building towers like this, clearly evidenced by the lack of sufficient elevator infrastructure.Parking was another gripe. There are only a few spots in this large hotel reserved for overnight guest parking, the rest is set aside for hourly parking for the general public and Valet parking. I've never been to a hotel where registered guests did not have priority over hourly parkers. Because self parking was full, we were sent across the street to the Banyan to park, where parking is $15 per night in cash only. Waiting for our elevator, getting down to the ground floor, across the street, up to our car and out the garage was a 15-minute ordeal. It was either that or wait for a Valet to bring our car out.Bottom line, Hyatt Place should stick to what they do best, airport and suburban hotels. Too many growing pains are evident at the Waikiki Hyatt Place.","Seattle, WA","Scott H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, WA</strong>",48,2.0

My boyfriend and I were just looking for a nice room to book while in Waikiki because we knew we weren't spending much time in the hotel... since there are so many trails and beaches for us to visit. So, we didn't have the need to spend tons of money on a resort. But I really needed a nice, clean and updated hotel! I try not to just hotels by the pictures, but I do! A lot of the hotels in our price ranges were very old-looking. I was very happy when I stumbled upon Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach. It looked very clean and modern and reasonably priced!We stayed for 9 nights and it was affordable to us. The big pros for this hotel was the price, free breakfast and NO RESORT FEES!!! I couldn't believe how other places had resort fees that made their price jump so much! So I was excited to find this hotel did not have resort fees!!! The walk to the beach is only 2 short blocks. And the rooms are nice, clean and spacious. The beds are very soft and comfortable. Out of all the hotels/resorts I've stayed in, this is my 2nd favorite bed! The bathroom is also very clean. Old and dirty bathrooms always give me the heebie jeebies and would need flip flops to take a shower in, but these were great! Sure, there's no bathtub, but why would you even need one in Hawaii?? The tv is large and there is a mini fridge. We had a small balcony, but it didn't matter to us. The room was nice and clean and that's all that matters.Breakfast was good... we didn't get to go every day but when I did I was always able to grab food to bring to our room. There was always enough food and it wasn't so crowded. There is a 24-hour fitness gym... the free weights only went up to 50lbs dumbbell if it matters. I'm a tiny girl so it was good enough for me!There is also free wifi. If you need to use the computer and print out vouchers for your day trips and such, you are able to do so in the lobby!There is only one con that could not be helped since every hotel probably charges for it... the parking! it was $30 per night if we did valet parking. There is self paring but it's first come, first served. If you are always out because of activities, then you have to resort to valet. FYI, they start charging if you keep your car there after midnight. Before midnight, we were told you weren't charged. At first, it was hard to get a straight answer about parking cost but eventually a nice valet named Pablo? informed us. We found a way about our parking dilemma after 2 nights of parking there... we parked ~2 blocks away at the 24-hour parking for Honolulu Zoo. $1/hour! The pool wasn't anything special in the hotel. It looked small... but I rarely saw anyone in it because why would you need to use the pool when the gorgeous beach is right there! All in all, I would definitely stay here again! We can't wait to go back to Hawaii!!!","Clifton, New Jersey","QueenOfShiba</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clifton, New Jersey</strong>",18,5.0

Having stayed in Waikiki before(at the Holiday Inn) we knew that the Hyatt was towards the end of the strip and that we would have to walk to get into the ""action."" That side of it didn't bother us much except at the end of the day when we really felt that extra block to walk. However, because of the location it is very quiet. Another positive was that it was only a 2 minute walk to the beach. We liked how clean the room was and how new it felt. The room felt very small. It was simply the bed, a chair and the tv and desk. We had to put one suitcase on the desk and the other on the floor in front of the chair which meant the doorway to the balcony was blocked. There was very little room to move around. The free breakfast was an added bonus with the usual continential breakfast available and a rotation of differnt types of hot food every few days. The negative for us was that for our final day and a half, we had no wifi connection. Apparently a part had broken and there was no internet from the 7th floor up. That was annoying as there was no sign informing people of this. Also on our last night, a water main burst on the street so the hotel had no water. The next morning they provided a free bottle of water to guests however we were flying back to Australia that day so it didn't really help us with wanting a shower before our 10 hour flight home. While the hotel was lovely, if we were to return to Waikiki we would stay in a more central location.","Hervey Bay, Australia","boots22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hervey Bay, Australia</strong>",28,4.0

Be aware that the breakfast area will be crowded, especially on a weekend. The customer service was very accommodating and helpful. I recommend requesting a room on a higher floor to get above the street noise. Partial ocean views are available, even being a few blocks from the beach. I would definitely stay here again.

There were plenty of shops and restaurants within a 15-minute walking distance.The breakfast came with the room and we had breakfast before heading to the airport. The food was average.

Good things:- Free breakfast with plenty of selection. That is a nice touch considering in Waikiki meals can be pricey. Fruits, pastries, hot and cold cereal, bacon and eggs etc etc. It was very busy as to be expected, but we felt it was run quite efficiently and the food didn't run empty.- Rooms were nice and clean as was the rest of the hotel. - Comfortable beds- Good location. We didn't find it too noisy (Waikiki can be very loud) because we were facing a side street. The hotel was just a couple of minutes walk to the beach. Most of the beach front hotels are very pricey compared to being a block or two away.- Free wi-fi (the other hotel we stayed at in Waikiki charged $10.00 per day)OK things:- Front desk staff were just ok. Not overly friendly, but not rude. Just doing their job...nothing more, nothing less. The bar staff were a little more in tune with customer service I think. They have a happy hour in the afternoon and make good tropical drinks.Things we didn't like:- If you want a decent size balcony with a view, you may want to give this place a miss. We were on the 5th floor (I asked for the highest floor possible and that was it - hotel was apparently very full). The balcony was so small that you couldn't even face forward in your chair. You had to sit sideways because it was only about 2 feet deep and maybe 8 feet long. We gazed over a rather ugly apartment building. Needless to stay, we didn't spend any time on it. Maybe you get a bigger balcony with a room upgrade??- The room was tiny.You get what you pay for. Overall no big complaints about this property. We were satisfied. We paid about $170.00 per night here. We stayed at another nearby Hilton property when we returned to Waikiki after the cruise we took. The Hilton was about $50.00 more per night and you paid for wifi and no breakfast included. It was worth paying the extra though to have a larger balcony with a fabulous view from the 30th floor, not to mention a much larger room.",kelowna,"David S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>kelowna</strong>",48,3.0

The informed traveler who books a non-refundable, 21 day advance reservation, will find that the price will be 20% lower than comparable like the Hyatt Regency, or the Marriott Resort, right across the street.While the numbers are by no means a bargain, they do provide great comfort given the generous amenities, like breakfast and free Wi-fi. The location is just perfect: you are close enough to the beach, but tucked away so as not to be too bothered by the noise.The staff is professional and extremely friendly. The style is bed and breakfast boutique instead of corporate procedural. Service is timely and efficient. Housekeeping replenished all the needed accessories.Upgraded suite had a view of Diamondhead. Room was spacious and uncluttered. Mini-living room couch and table is separated from the bed area by a tinted glass partition.

We ended up on the 3rd floor next to the pool and breakfast area. It had no view and surprisingly quiet. Breakfast was good, hot, and healthy. You get your normal breakfast items plus rice, kimchi, and miso soup. The gym was good size with lots of cardio equipment and barbells as the only weights. The pool is tiny, but you are so close to the beach. You are able to take the pool towels to the beach. The location is very good as you are near the south end of the beach where it is less busy. Excellent sushi resteraunt across the street in the Mariott where it is 50% off sushi between 5:30-6pm on Mondays. Also, fresh udon resteraunt is about 10-15min walk - min 20min line up to get in, but it is cheap and good. The line moves quick and it is worth the wait. If you want to hike to diamond head, it about 7 miles from the hotel. $25 ride to the airport using johnnycabhi.com - realable with pickup and return. Can't wait for our next trip here.","Calgary, Canada","ELCHEAPEE</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",93,5.0

This hotel is a great location, we took advantage of the taxi service from their web page, Charlie's Taxi offers a flat rate from the airport for $29. Good deal and that way you don't have to stop at everyone else's hotel before you get to yours. This hotel is one block from zoo and maybe two blocks to the Duke on Waikiki Beach. We had a room with an ocean view and diamond head view on the 11th floor, but I don't know if I'd pay for that next time, as you are barely in your room and also the hotels below are pretty dumpy looking. The rooms/hotel is beautifully renovated. Breakfast was included in our stay and it was excellent. Huge selection of stuff to choose from and you could take it to your room to eat if you'd like. We did as we found a lot of people in the breakfast line rude and pushy.....you'd think that someone had said this is all the food we have left, so get it now or you'll have none.....not quite sure why people were like that but they were. The pool area is small but not as small as I was expecting from reading other reviews. My daughter was the only one in it a few times. It has lots of lounge chairs around it, so I was always able to sit while she swam. The hotel also has two little gift/snack shops in the basement which were very reasonably priced for their snacks and souvenirs. There is also an ABC store just one block over.

Most of the reviews I had read prior to booking are very accurate. The hotel is freshly renovated, modern and clean. The staff is exceptionally friendly and professional.

You gave us excellent advice! We loved the free hot breakfast and free wifi and these two features alone would be why I would be likely to stay here when I return. There is no resort fee, which is excellent. There is reasonable parking nearby. When we arrived the regular parking, which I had noted was cheaper than other places, was full and only expensive valet parking was left. We drove across the street and parked for a reasonable weekly rate. This worked fine. Check in was very quick and painless. We were told we were ""upgraded"" from a mountain view to a city view room. Can that ever be considered an upgrade? I questioned this and was told the room was bigger but I seen other rooms the maid was cleaning and this was not the case. However, our lower room made it very accessible to breakfast, lobby and work out room so we were content, especially since the elevators could be slow at peak times. The hotel is very close to the beach and conveniently located next to an abc store. As a gold passport member there are extra perks that are worth it. We especially appreciated a hospitality room at the end of our last day at the beach to shower before our 10 pm flight. I was extremely pleased with this hotel.

The only complaint would be that some of the hotel guests could be a little more considerate of others that have not yet eaten their breakfast and not load your plate up four and five times.

Every morning there is a good complimentary breakfast served on the pool deck.

In fact, this hotel seems like a favorite of tour groups. Not really a convention hotel as there is limited meeting rooms.The hotel is not quite ON the beach -- but just a few blocks away. It is right across from the ""bus/service"" entrance to the huge Marriott Waikiki so rooms facing the Marriott will be noisy from tour buses and delivery trucks. The Diamond Tower would be quieter.

Skillet (free breakfast) has heated-in-the-oven type eggs/bacon/waffle combinations (not quite your full american breakfast but standard Hyatt Place fare). But it also has fresh pineapples and rice/miso offering.- Toiletries are your standard Hyatt Place offering, except that body lotion is ""on demand"" only and not in the rooms. So if you need moisturizer, be sure to ask for it at the front desk.- Watch your food during breakfast to avoid birds taking off with a bite. Trays in the room are provided so bringing food back to your room is allowed -- and even encouraged.- Some rooms have a full sofa-bed available.-- Keys are now the RFID kind. No demagnetization of keys and you need to have your key when using the elevator.- Lobby is ""open air"" as is traditional in many Hawaii hotels. Lots of space to stretch out. There's a tour operator right in the lobby, not something you find in many Hyatt Places.- There's wine tasting offered one afternoon. But a little pricey $18 for 6 pours if I remember correctly.- Very limited parking. So don't plan on renting a car if staying at the hotel. But it's walking distance to Waikiki and we had city (TheBus) transit service right in front of the hotel that took us to the tourist places (Ala Moana Shopping Center, Downtown Honolulu, HNL airport, DiamonHead, Pearl Harbor, etc).

Check-in was a breeze and the room is clean, functional, and large enough for two people and two large suitcases. We were placed on the ""Penthouse"" floor (all the way at the top) which gave us great views of Diamond Head and the ocean. Everything worked fine and the bathroom had plenty of hot water and a nice walk-in shower (no tub). The location is excellent: within 1000ft from the beach and outside of the extremely crowded areas of Waiki but still very close to the shops and boutiques. The hotel offers $18/day parking, but another great option is the lot at the zoo within 50 feet of the hotel. You can pay $1/hour here and end up cheaper if you only pay to park the car at night. There are even some free spots nearby if you can park after 9pm and move the car before 7am. Plenty of restaurants and there is an ABC Store (convenience store) right next door to get anything you forgot. Three small issues I would like to point out:1). When we were in Oahu it was windier than usual, but you can clearly hear the wind howling on the top floor of the hotel. It's not obnoxiously loud but it is definitely there. It didnt keep us awake but a very light sleeper may have trouble. 2). There are only two elevators for 20 floors worth of rooms so you can imagine the wait can get pretty long as elevators can either be full or take forever to get to your floor. My wife and I actually walked down the stairs from the 20th floor because of an extremely long wait, one morning. 3). The breakfast order is outdoors; great if you want to enjoy the beautiful weather but tough when you want to enjoy breakfast in peace without chasing birds away. One of them almost pooped squarely on my wife's head. I understand that the risks with an open-air dining spot but a simple net over the area would keep the birds out without spoiling the open-air feel. Overall a very good stay and a hotel that I would use again the next time we come back. You cant beat the value, location, and modern rooms.","Morrisville, North Carolina","Matt V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Morrisville, North Carolina</strong>",20,4.0

The location is good, five minutes' walk from the coast. Maybe it's a distraction close to the main road where traffic is quite loud, so I recommend choosing rooms face away from the road, perhaps to the sea. Rooms on the lower floors are less expensive (due to the aforementioned noise), on the higher floors the rooms are larger and more expensive. We have a room in the 4 floor, the noise was heard quite a bit, so it was not possible to sleep with the window open. A small swimming pool is on the third floor, next to him in the morning serves a very good and rich breakfast. but there is a little space, so it is necessary to wait for the free table. The hotel also offers self-service laundry, a travel agency, shops, as well as arrange for transportation to the airport, with a fixed price of 29 dollars.

This was my first trip to Honolulu and I was pleased with my stay at the Hyatt Place Waikiki and would recommend it for those who want to stretch their dollars and don't mind a three minute walk to the beach and a 15 min walk to the shopping center of Waikiki. My 14th floor view of Diamond Head was so, so because a building partially blocked, but I wasn't there for the view.Pros:Very Clean room, probably cleanest I've been in the past 12 months of a dozen or more hotels.Room size -very large, not sure if there is a difference in rooms but mine had two queens, and just a lot of empty space giving it an airy feel, plus a couch/sitting area and small balcony, good for drying towels and bathing suits.Excellent helpful, friendly staff - I left behind my phone charger, called the hotel the next day and the housekeeping manager David Smith, mailed it to me at my request (i paid a small postage fee, less expensive than replacing). Shaun and Blaine the valet parking guys were great.Front desk help great.Affordable rates, would have expected this hotel to be pricierFree WifiFree hot/cold breakfast buffet. Staff was always refilling and cleaning area and present. Included a miso soup with tofu, vegetables, etc for those wanting a Japanese breakfast option.Free coffee in lobby in morningLobby snack bar.No restaurant - but 24/7 food menu available including entrees and more to bring to your room (I did not try this service)A 24/7 restaurant called Mac/24 is around the corner in the Hilton. Other restaurants are toward the beach two very short blocks away.A Lawson convenience store in lobby was opened til 1 am.and prices were cheaper than the ubiquitous ABC convenience stores everywhere else. Even the sushi in Lawson was good.Taxi Flat rate of $29 to airport.Knowledgeable, friendly concierge/tour guides in lobby to help with local attractions and tours and such.Small pool, I did see people using it.Gym - did not useCons - (not specific to the hotel, rather the location)Location- I would have liked to have been a little closer to the heart of the shopping in Waikiki where the Sheraton, Royal Hawaiian and Surfrider are - it's about a 15 min leisurely walk on the boulevard that runs along the ocean. But the savings at this hotel were worth the walk.Beach - the beach just down the street wasn't geat- there's a retaining wall of some sort to keep the waves out, just feels weird, but if you head straight down to the ocean and make a left, and head north just a block or two, the beach is nicer and you can rent a lounge chair for cheap- $5 an hour or $20 for the day. The better beaches are outside of Honolulu. Neutral -Birds - let me address this as I've seen it in many reviews. The breakfast buffet is served in a covered area. It was incredibly clean, always staffed and I ate there 4 mornings and no birds were in the food area. You can take the food back to your room or eat in the outdoor patio. Yes, there are birds who want to eat your crumbs. Honolulu is a major cityYou can't keep the birds out unless you enclose the common areas - but this is the pool area, so it's not going to be enclosed. I was not grossed out or bothered by the birds and I've got high standards. So if a dozen or so pigeons are going to bother you, then don't use the free breakfast.Bed - I had a good night's sleep, but the edge of my bed was weird, the mattress felt like a foam mattress at the end. Basically couldn't sit on the edge of the bed, but with the couch and desk chair, I didn't need to. But I did sleep well which is why this is a neutral issue.Zoo- around the corner from it if you are into this sort of thing.I didn't use the public transportation but I saw city buses and tour buses and trolleys all the time.","Chandler, Arizona","burbankgirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chandler, Arizona</strong>",70,5.0

I had an Ocean View room on the 17th floor. Yes, there are two buildings between Hyatt Place and Beach, but if you are up on a high floor the view is quite beautiful. Best of all, while I've given up on any place in Honolulu being what I'd consider fully quiet, this was relatively quiet and with earplugs or closed door to lanai slept beautifully. Comfortable bed, refrigerator and coffeemaker in room. I loved the location. At east end of Waikiki can still easily walk to central parts, just two blocks from Zoo, beach, Kapiolani Park. Easy walk to aquarium, Kaimana Beach (which is a little less crowded and nicer than main Waikiki Beaches). Breakfast surprised me - I can't normally eat American style breakfasts at hotels, but this included Japanese style as well as American and I was able to have miso soup, rice, pickles and tofu. (FYI, they also had eggs, waffles, oatmeal, and other items). I think what impressed me most was the service. While by Waikiki standards this is a moderate priced hotel, service was excellent. From walking in to checking out staff was friendly and helpful. They had a computer center where I was able to print out my boarding pass which was another plus. Finally, if you are a Hyatt Gold or Platinum member, you can use points to get free nights or reduce cost.

The reply back a few days later was no problem. Bags were stored tied together with other bags by a cable cord in the lobby. When we were able to check in we were given a single bed room when I had booked two beds in the room, (and was told this was an upgrade on my booking) so went back down to ask for my original room as I needed two beds, not one. The girl behind the desk said this wasn't possible and that it is a request, not an actual booking that can't be honored on my room type, apparently, even though they advertise city view rooms with two queen beds on their own website for booking. She suggested we sleep on the pull out sofa - not what I'm paying good money for and when I booked the room over 6 months prior. After making us wait over half an hour, and being told we would have to move rooms later in the week from a one bed to a two bed, eventually the situation was rectified and we were in fact given a two bed room like I'd booked (so turns out they existed after all). Room was huge but on the second floor so was not subject to the key activation security for the elevators, which only works for levels 3 and above. However, I think we were punished for asking for the two bed room we had booked for as our room backed onto the elevator shaft (not too much noise from that, thankfully), and also the driveway by Kuhio Ave where traffic was super loud all night long and we were woken around 6 A.M. each morning by the delightful noise of the dumpster truck arriving to empty the dumpster in the driveway one floor down from our bedroom window. Noise was terrible - I have stayed in hotels by the airport and hotels on Broadway in NYC and never heard a sound so they really do need to soundproof these rooms.Breakfast was good with a hot food selection on a two day rotation basis. However as it is outdoors by the pool birds are absolutely everywhere, which is not good as I have a huge bird phobia! Location is good with a block walk to the south end of Waikiki Beach and close to the bus stop and an ABC Store. A tip for the hotel, as I prefer to book direct through the hotel website where possible/feasible - make your prices on your own website more competitive to third party sites and people will be more likely to book direct with the hotel - first time in a long time I've used a third party site as the hotel site's prices were astronomically high comparatively.","Melbourne, Australia","aquathest</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",16,3.0

Plus the Andaz in Maui is awesome. Back to the hotel... only 4 stars because the pool isn't worth getting into since its so small and no hot tub. However everything else about it was just what we needed... free breakfast that has lots of options and slightly changes each day (watch out for birds), close proximity to beach and main Waikiki restaurants, complimentary ocean view room upgrade, nice updated rooms and nice tv.At only 12000 hyatt points, I would definitely look to stay here first IF we go back to Waikiki in the future.","Salt Lake City, Utah","Dan B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salt Lake City, Utah</strong>",0,4.0

We got a free upgrade to a deluxe ocean view (booked a regular ocean view) without asking. The room was on the 11th floor, which was not high enough to see the ocean without other buildings blocking it, so I would say it was more of a partial ocean view. The room itself was spacious and very clean. Bed was comfortable. Rooms cleaned daily but they left our food tray behind one day.Hotel is very close to beach - probably a 5 minute walk. Located close to the zoo/aquarium. We walked down the strip (amazing shopping, we couldn't believe it!). Tour buses often parked across the street at the Marriott. Be careful when booking tours as they confused us with the Hyatt Regency and one tour didn't pick us up because of it, others made us go to the Mariott. So somewhat of an inconvenient location for the tours but just make sure you double and triple check when booking.The concierge desk is not visible when you walk in so be sure to ask.Breakfast was ok - they don't provide trays, you must remember to bring your tray from your room. Coffee is quite strong - selection ok regarding food, pretty typical. Big money saver.Pool is a small rectangle. Not great but I recommend spending your time at the beach anyway. Wouldn't have been a deal breaker unless we brought our kids.Cafe around the corner from the front desk offers some Starbucks items but we never got served - stood there without being acknowledged so we went elsewhere. Not the hotel's fault though.On our last day we had an early check out but a late flight. They will hold your luggage and give you a courtesy room to shower in but you must book in advance to get the time you want and you only get 30 min.We opted to pay a day rate and we were moved to a room in the other tower, it was way smaller (not a deluxe) and just had a shower. It would have been ok for a couple but that's it.All in all I would say that this hotel is better for couples or people with older kids. It's clean, economical, friendly staff, and it smells heavenly! It is a no-frills place, so if you are looking for fancy resort style, this isn't for you. However, Hawaii is expensive so I would say save your money, stay here, and spend what you saved on the tours.Thanks for a great stay and memorable vacation.

The complementary breakfast was OK and typical of many chain hotels such as Holiday Inn Express or Marriott Fairfield Inns. The coffee is Starbucks and outstanding. If you don't think the breakfast is adequate they will not MAKE you eat it and you are free to go anywhere else. The breakfast crew does a nice job handling the morning crowd. The pigeons in the breakfast area are not as bad as I was led to believe by other reviews. It is not exactly a scene from Alfred Hitchcock'sMovie ""The Birds"". However don't leave your food unattended for very long. It is a short walk to the beach and many restaurants.The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating.

The coffee is also good and strong, and they have take out cups so you can grab your coffee and go. En route, we saw some of the other hotels I had looked at, and am SO glad we chose the Hyatt Place! This is also easy walking distance to the quieter end of the beach - so you can actually walk along the pavement without being hassled by people trying to get you to have your nails done or shoot firearms. The beach was also quieter - a real no brainer to swim there!The staff are all lovely.

I had researched lots of Waikiki hotels for the perfect holiday. We were travelling with 3 teenagers/young adults. We stayed for 10 days over Xmas. Hyatt Park fulfilled my requirements which included large rooms (opt for Deluxe Queen with cozy corner), free wi-fi, free breakfast, ocean views, no resort fee, car parking, within easy walking distance to beach and shops, welcoming staff etc. The Deluxe Queen room was large (50sqm) and adequate for 4 people. We also booked the Deluxe King next door which was perfect also.We arrived early (8am) after a long flight. Our room was immediately available and we were offered breakfast also. I had asked for a room in the Diamond a Tower, highest floor with ocean views and the room was perfect. A huge thanks to Monique who assisted me via email prior to arrival. The Hyatt is recently newly renovated. Staff are excellent. Nothing was too much trouble. Free breakfast was a bonus and we sometimes used the trays provided and took it back to the room. I had read the lifts were slow but as we were in the Diamond Tower we never had to wait more than a minute. The room on Floor 14 was very quiet, really comfy beds, excellent wifi, TV and amenities. We never noticed any undue noise from the street. The hotel is at the Diamond Head end of Waikiki and only minutes from the shops. We enjoyed the nightly walks up and down the strip each evening. We rented a car and were lucky to get a car park for our stay. Pool was small but as the location to the beach was only a short 5 min walk it was not important. The gym and laundry facilities were adequate for our needs. We ate out each evening and never had to walk more than 10-15 mins to a restaurant. The majority of good shops and restaurants are about a 10minute walk which is great for exercise after a meal!We booked a couple of tours through hotel, thank you Chris (Expedia) who organised the Xmas Day helicopter flight at short notice even after being told there was nothing available. Great location for tour pickups right at the front door and on the bus routes. The hotel happily organised a late checkout and a convenience room to use later in the day as we had a midnight flight. Perfect!!Overall if you require a smaller, boutique, friendlier, newer hotel I would highly recommend this hotel. This is not really a hotel for small children (ie kids clubs, resort activities) or if you plan to spend endless hours at the hotel. It is however perfect for couples, older families or business travellers who require comfort with no hassles or intend to be out exploring each day. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and would not hesitate in staying here again.",Apia,"Maree R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Apia</strong>",14,5.0

The checkin was painless and welcoming staff. We checked in late and had inform the hotel about our late flight.After checkin there seems to be minimal staff to help load in trolley so I did it myself with a half asleep child and a hubby who tries to find parking.As I cart the 4 luggage that we have I didn't realize that there's two wing and ended up in the wrong one. All the way to the high floor I called reception and they told me that my room was the other building. Was not excited to roll this cartful of luggage and push. I passed thru the reception and 2 staff saw me and didn't even acknowledged to help. :( finally I got to our roomIt was small than what I'm used to and we requested a King size bed. With a sofa three feet away from the bed so there's much room to really. The balcony has ample space and a partial ofOf Waikiki beach. Cleanliness of the room I question. Few times I had to pick up a piece of paper or a crumb from the night before. And I don't think theyVacuum the rooms on a daily basis. That really erks me because we are on the beach all day and sand is bound to collect so not happy about the carpet how it's not being cleaned.The daily breakfast was plenty and busy but you can always find a seat. Just make sure you don't leave your food unattended . This was a daily morning entertainment when people don't realize those birds are so notorious! They want your food! The cleaning staff and kitchen crew for breakfast are pleasant :)The cafe by the reception tho was a different story. We had a late snack night and a waiter seemed like he didn't wanna be there a simple mushroom soup order and milk for the lil guy. Waiter didn't make eye contact and just not engaging.

It was about 2-3 short blocks to the beach and a block from the ABC store. We didn't have any problem with noise but we didn't face he street. The staff was very accommodating and we set up many of our expeditions with Expedia expert near the lobby. Most tour companies would pick you up at the curb or on the other side of the street. We made leis down in the lobby which was a wonderful experience and it felt like genuinely Hawaiian experience, many other people joined in with us after they saw how much fun we were having. The young man down at the bar named Nick was very friendly and explained to us how to get to several locations we asked about. The rooms were nice and more than what I expected when room is a commodity there. The free breakfast gave plenty of options and of course the pineapple was out of this world I ate it everyday we were there and have tried it since hoping to have such a beatific reminder of our time there, with no luck. We stayed in November 2013 for 8 nights. Since leaving I thought about nothing but returning to Hawaii and I would stay at Hyatt Place.

There was free wifi, mini fridge, large screen TV, coffee maker and a mini balcony with chairs. The room was smallish but liveable for our 7-night stay. The room was refreshed daily (Lanie was so thorough!). Other amenities were available upon request (curling iron, baby chair, shaving kit, etc).The friendly staff were relatively quick with service. The lounge area was huge in the front. Off to the side was the 24/7 Galleria Cafe/Bar with another lounge area. Computers with internet/printer access are behind this area. Expedia reps comprised the Concierge desk. They work daily 0700-1800. Our rep was Chris B who was patient and explained things well. There were also foreign language reps, offered by a different company. There is a small pool and fitness centre.Breakfast was complimentary daily 0630-0930. We weren't expecting much. But we were surprised: there were 2 different daily hot portions (waffles and sausages or French toast and scrambled eggs) plus a section with miso soup (plus rice and kim chi). There was fresh fruit, breads, toast condiments, oatmeal (with condiments), yogurts, cereals, pastries, granola, juices and coffee. The hotel recommended coming early or bring your tray and eating in your room. Tables were constantly busy. (Watch out for the aggressive pigeons!)Overall, HP was worth the price especially if you get a deal. We didn't drive but just like any downtown touristy area, parking is expensive. The city bus service is pretty good. But look around for free trolleys. We found out you could book a free trolley from the neighbourly Aston hotel. The access to shopping is ridiculously easy. Check out the smaller independent shops (like Maki shop beside Subway on Kalakaua Avenue). Be prepared for the street sellers (only one wholesale tour salesman was supremely aggressive). I was surprised to see the high numbers of homeless individuals.

I used the valet parking, something I usually hate. But in a big city you are not always in control. It took the valet just a couple minutes to get the car. Nice group of guys. The housekeeping staff was friendly and did a great job. The best deal in Honolulu must be the free breakfast. I looked for a tip jar and didn't see one. The staff keeps the eating area clean. The food was good and a great variety of juices, coffee, cereals and hot eggs and either bacon or sausage. Items change daily. Stayed on the18th floor. Elevator was fast, no long waits. Sat on the room balcony and enjoyed our wine. We had a ""mountain view"" which was fine. The hotel is in a big city, a block from the beach so don't expect great views from your room, but you aren't paying Ocean Vista prices either. We don't spend much time in the room. Easy walk to the beach and shopping.","West Covina, California","jimh242</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Covina, California</strong>",17,5.0

The Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach was a perfect blend of the two and where we would likely stay were we to return for a lengthier visit to Waikiki only.We were upgraded to a deluxe city view room, which we understand significantly increases the square footage. Even though the room was city view, we could see ocean from the lanai, which was a nice bonus. The room was clean and the beds comfortable. There was a little seating area, which was nice but the table was this tiny ottoman so not a good place for eating or drinking. The provided breakfast was not amazing but was not horrible. plenty of hot meats and pastries and usually some egg choice.

Our balcony did not have the best view (3rd floor) but we were on the same floor as the breakfast. The room was OK, nice bed, shower only, but roomy enough. As an FYI, if you sat on our balcony you needed to turn the aircon off as it pumped warm air onto the balcony (unless you want a heated balcony!). The buffet breakfast (included) was OK and had the added advantage that you could take it back to your room on the supplied trays. The staff were always welcoming and could not help enough. BTW, the hotel will supply beach towels FOC so no need to fill up you case with them. Simply take them in the morning and return at night so you always have fresh one's. So with the rooms, the staff and the extra's we found it good value and would return.

They tried to scape down the ceilings and paint over the texture which does a somewhat good job of giving the room an updated look but you can definitely tell it was once an old style Waikiki hotel. Bed was very comfortable and the furniture updated. Our room had a very nice Lanai which wrapped around to see some of the Pacific through the buildings. The free breakfast offers a basic meal to get your day started and saves you lots of money as meals in Waikiki tend to be expensive. Pool was kind of a letdown as it's tiny and the fitness room also leaves a little to be desired but all in all a very reasonable place to stay in Waikiki.

The only problem is it is outside by the pool and if it is stormy, you have very little seating under cover however, you can take your food to your room or to seating in the lobby no big deal. The only other minor problem we found was in the wing we were in, there were only two elevators. When it is busy, the wait for an elevator can be quite long.

The room Was Very clean and recently updated. It was on the smaller size as far as rooms go, but it did have a full sized couch and dresser. The TV was on top of the Dresser which was on the left wall, not at the foot of the bed. I think if they had arranged the rooms differently, it would feel like a much better use of space. It was not laid out well. The bathroom was near the door, and not visible from the bed, so it gave the room a little larger feel. The sink was on the outside of the bathroom and had almost not space for toiletries. If you are more than one person, you have to put them under the sink. Again, a poor design and use of space. The bathroom had a walk in shower and commode. That room had no a/c but did have a small window that needed to be opened after each shower to let the steam out. There was a safe in the closet and a small frig in the bedroom. There was a coffee pot and coffee as well. There is a large tray in the room, best used for the complimentary breakfast on the rooftop. Breakfast was excellent and included a huge choice of foods to everyone's liking. Plenty of hot coffee, tea, cereals, pastries, eggs, potatoes, yogurt, fruits and juices. The staff keeps everything full and replaced. There was never anything missing. The birds are a problem and it requires a little team work to get your breakfast at the table without the pigeons attacking. The staff tries their best to keep them away as well. That is why the tray is necessary, so you can carry all your food at once and not have to leave it unattended on your table. I do think they could come up with a ""green"" solution to keep the pigeons away, like owls or fishing wire. I did not seem to notice this problem at any of the other outdoor areas we ate.

Getting all of this at the prices we were paying was a GREAT value compared to other places in Waikiki beach - can't emphasize that enough.Only (nitpicking) negatives are the lack of on-site parking (which, to be fair, is something you'd probably encounter at a bunch of hotels in the area; there is a large, separate parking garage a half block away that you can also use) and the pigeons that hover nearby at breakfast (which, to be fair, is probably the fault of people who don't bus their trays and instead leave partially eaten food out, which the pigeons pounce on).

The best experience a hotel can offer you is an uneventful one. No one wants memories of hassles, frustrations, or bad service. Luckily this hotel offers none of those. The staff are very helpful. They are fair and accommodating where they can. This hotel is in a great location and is one of the newer properties on the island. It's also one of the few hotels on the island that has contemporary styled rooms. Internet is stable. Hot water is abundant. Beds are comfortable. You really can't go wrong with this hotel. It's less than a block from the beach. It's next to the zoo which gives you good views of Diamond Head plus the beach. It's an easy stroll down the beach to a multitude of restaurants. My only con for this property, which is really a con for almost every property in Waikiki, is parking. This property only has about 18 self-park parking spaces. They do also offer valet but they have even less. So make sure you confirm that they actually have a space for you. This property uses a third party vendor to manage parking. They dress in the same shirts as the hotel but they operate completely separate and there is little communication between the two. So even though you've purchased parking as part of your room rate, doesn't mean you will actually have a parking space. This has happened to me more than once. Therefore always a good idea to confirm with the hotel they actually have room for your car when booking a rate that includes parking. Otherwise you could be left in the cold. Parking in Waikiki is a pain. There are very limited parking spaces on the island in general. The closest public parking to hotel is the zoo parking lot. It's meter parking, but you can use a credit card. You just have to keep feeding it. These meters don't have an off period. So you're billed 24/7. It's approximately a $1.00 an hour which is the going rate in Waikiki in general. If you have to park there it's approximately $24.00 a day versus approximately $15.00 a day at the hotel.","Paris, France","BizTravelFR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",74,4.0

There are 4 computers and a printer downstairs for use, which is great to print out boarding passes. The free breakfast is fantastic with something different everyday. You can get eggs, sausages, breakfast sandwiches, fruits, yogurts, cereals, several bread choices. They even have an Asian breakfast section with rice, miso, kimchee etc. Unlike most breakfast where your choices are cereal, toast and muffins. This accommodation really helps stretch your travel budget. The only flaw to the breakfast would be the location which is out by the pool. The birds can be annoying and the second you leave to get something, they swoop in and starting eating your food. I would think someone would've thought to put a net or screening up .

How do I love thee, let me count the ways. First, the breakfast buffet is simply the best that I have ever seen inside US and it’s completely complimentary. The hot items changed daily while the fresh fruit and other staples are available in abundance every day. The room is modern and stylish but the best thing is the large LG flatscreen TV. The TV is enormous, at least 50 if not 55 inches – the largest that I have ever encountered in any hotel. It was fabulous to watch the World Series on a large screen TV after work. Additionally, Hyatt is merely 2 blocks from the Waikiki beach that is literally lined with restaurants and shops as far as you can walk. There are more restaurants in walking distance than you can shake a bat at and the biggest problem I had every night was deciding where to dine. Another good location perk is that Waikiki is close to Hanauma Bay so it’s an easy 30 minute drive east on H1 to the best snorkeling beach on the island.The only issue is with parking. There is no free parking anywhere in Waikiki near the beach. Hyatt offers valet parking however there are limited number of self parking spaces that you can request if any become available. All of the valets are friendly and helpful as well as the front desk clerks.

They also have kimchi, steamed white rice, pickled veggies, and miso soup if you prefer a more asian-style breakfast. They alternate days cooking waffles, pancakes, or french toast (the best out of the 3) as another option to the breakfast sandwich. I'm not a big coffee person, but they do have Starbucks downstairs operated by the hotel staff. You can bring down the tray provided in each hotel room to bring back breakfast if you want to eat in privacy. The breakfast buffet is served outside near the pool and birds are a problem.

There was a queen bed and a sofa with a pull-out bed. There's free wifi. Upon arrival, we were greeted very warmly by the staff and they gave the kids their own small sand bucket with toys to use as they pleased. It was great. They also had a small fridge (bigger than a mini-fridge) that was adequate to stock up 12 beer bottles, a few cans of soda, water, and snacks. On Friday afternoons they offer a lei-making class. In terms of location, though only a block away from the beach, if you want to go to Duke's or International Marketplace, the walk can be anywhere from 15-20 minutes. Bring a stroller if you have kids. Want a workout? If you're feeling a bit adventurous, take a long walk down Kapahulu Ave. to reach Leonard's for malasadas, Safeway, ONO seafood (where they have great fresh poke bowls), and plenty of other food places. Diamond Head and the Zoo are next door. Hanuama Bay is 10-15 minute drive away. The nearest ABC store is a two-minute walk and the hotel has it's own little mini-mart. Hotel parking is minimal (maybe 20 spaces?) and costly. We did have a car and never had an issue finding a space no matter how many times we went in and out (it's low tourist season, though). We would definitely come back here and recommend this to family and friends. Each day we were able to load up on breakfast that lasted us to past lunchtime, and it was one less meal to pay for and worry about. I truly appreciate that the staff were extremely kind and welcoming. It made our stay more enjoyable. They greeted our kids so kindly each time and happy kids make for a good vacation.","Alameda, California","better3rd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alameda, California</strong>",46,4.0

Breakfast was included, with good quality bread, juices, pastries, but poor quality of dairy products (milk was cold, but yogurts and cheese were warm and not adequately iced/cooled for the warm weather so be careful when consuming these products) and fruits (only pineapple and melon were available and sometimes small flees flying around so one needs to wait until they bring out fresh fruit before digging in). Birds on the deck were a real nuisance, so watch where you sit. Poor selection for vegetarians or those on a gluten free diet. Otherwise, the tea, coffee, juices, and breads were a convenience if you don't want to go out and spend money on breakfast. Close proximity to the beach and shops which was helpful, and a lot of tour companies pick up from either the Hyatt or the Marriott across the street. The rooms were small and not a great view (we had a 14 floor ocean view but not great as building are blocking the view). Make sure you take air spray for the bathroom as the fans are non-existent, so it smells the room - if you catch my drift. The AC conditioner was good and you could vary the temperature so the room would not get too hot or cold. Main thing was that they were cleaned well and fresh sheets and towels were available every day. About a 3 star quality, but overall good for a reasonable budget trip which was what we wanted. If you want more luxury, try the Sheraton on Royal Hawaiin which are the best from what we could see, although I'm sure there were others.","Vancouver, Canada","Mira K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",8,3.0

If you don't feel like reading my whole review and see which hotel I would recommend, here it is!Without hesitation, I would say, stay at the Hyatt Place!!!The only three things that were better at the Aston were the great balcony views, the proximity of the ocean and the fact that you can borrow beach chairs.We booked 4 nights on Expedia and had a good deal at $170/night. The good news is that the Hyatt Place doesn't charge a resort fee (like the Aston and the hotel Renew next door). The resort fees have unfortunately been spreading like a virus in Hawaii.The check in was really nice. We had a few simple requests: a quiet high floor room, not to be next to an ice machine, a pop machine or near an elevator.Unfortunately, one wish could not be granted. We were offered a room on the 2nd floor.From now on, I have to admit that Lynn at the desk was such a pleasure to deal with. She tried everything she could to please us and to make it work.The hotel seemed to be full that day and she tried to look into the next day to see if we could move to a higher floor. She was successful and we were set to move to the new room the next day.In the meantime, we moved into the room on the 2nd floor and thanks to Lynn, she put us in a corner unit. (they seem to be much bigger rooms)Honestly, we were pleasantly surprised with the room: the quality of the furniture, the cool design bathroom, the extra small living-room with another big flat screen TV, the large comfortable king size bed and the extra big wrap around lanai.Even though the room was great on the 2nd floor, it felt claustrophobic with the apartment building right across from it.I would definitely recommend to make sure to ask to be at least on the 4th of 5th floor.We were a bit familiar with the hotel. In fact, we had previously stayed in the hotel when it was called the Ocean Resort hotel a long time ago.I can tell you that they have done an amazing job with the hotel. The former place was a dump. But now, we love it. After staying at the Aston 4 or 5 times in a row, it was a breath of fresh air to see a great new and current hotel like the Hyatt Place. No moldy bathroom and no holes in the curtains. Just a fresh cool designed hotel in 2013. (I realize I'm not being very nice to Aston)...The noise. Honestly, I was expecting so much more noise (and we are light sleepers), especially on the 2nd floor. But it wasn't a problem at all for us. The breakfast. We tried the breakfast on the first morning. We didn't like the experience. It was a bit similar to the way the Aston functions and frankly, it was not our thing.The food was average and it was too much of a hassle with too many people. We preferred going to the Starbucks at the corner of Kalakaua and Kapahulu.After reading so many reviews, we were not surprised or upset about the breakfast situation.The location. We are very familiar with Oahu and we love this location. It's a bit outside of the madness but close enough if you want to go in there.It's also close to Kapiolani park and Queensurf beach which is a bit more quiet to other Waikiki beaches. As a tip, I would recommend to walk to Queensurf if you want to take great pictures of Waikiki, especially at sunset.As mentioned before by previous reviews, there are homeless people in the neighborhood.The parking. We've used the Waikiki Banyan parking which is is only a couple of minutes away for the Hyatt Place on Kuhio Avenue. It's 15$/day or 80$/week as October 2013. Their prices have been going up but are still the best in the neighborhood.The views. The Hyatt place is surrounded by very tall buildings and chances are that you won't have much of a view on lower floors (possibly on higher floors too).In conclusion, after trying out the Hyatt Place, there is no way that we would return to the Aston Waikiki beach hotel.The Hyatt Place beats it in every categories.I'd like to thank Lynn again at the reception for making our stay so much more comfortable and pleasant. If you realize that she's checking you in, you will know that you are well taken care of.","Vancouver, Canada","bcgraph</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",113,5.0

We arrived at 12 noon and our room was ready, Expedia booking was for 1 king bed and we wanted 2 queens instead. Terrence was very helpful and within minutes switched our rooms. The deluxe room was spacious which is a big plus for families. The bathroom is quite small but again nothing to complain about as long as it is clean. Valet was $28 a day, comparable to what most hotels offer. If you wanted to park it yourself you can do so across the street at Banyan but since we have 2 kids on tow we chose to use their valet service. They gave out complimentary beach toys for the kids which comprised of a bucket, 2 shovels and 2 molds. Our kids were excited, small details like this is a big plus for us. Again you don't have to worry about beach towels as they provide it. They are not the big beach ones you might prefer but we go to the beach everyday so having fresh towels everyday was nice. They have free wifi and the speed was quite good. They also have several computers at the lobby free of charge and you can also print stuff free of charge, that again is a good thing as I travel a lot and this is the first hotel who didn't charge me anything for printing boarding passes and confirmation emails. Breakfast is adequate, not the best but it takes out the guess work on where to eat. The location is perfect for us as we love that we are on the calmer side of Waikiki beach. We walked along the beach and yes there are beach front hotels but they are also quite busy and loud. For families traveling with kids this is a good spot so kids are not exposed to the loud party ambiance of the other hotels along the beach. If you are single and would like to party, this is not a good place for you as it is a long walk from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki beach. My husband and I both agreed we got our money's worth here. Great staff, Annabelle and Terrence were very helpful and they know the term ""service with a smile"".

The hotel was not bad, all the staff were friendly, and our rooms were upgraded, for free, both times. The rooms were large, but the bathrooms were quite small, and the sink area poorly lit. Both rooms were noisy, even one which overlooked a side street rather than the main road. The second room had not been cleaned very well in the bathroom - I cleaned up two stains myself that the housekeeper had missed.The location was convenient for the beach, shops and restaurants.The breakfast buffet was chaos. A notice in the room suggested that you take a tray down and bring food back to your room, as it was likely to be busy. The breakfast room was small for the number of guests, and had very few places to sit. We did indeed take food back to the room, but it was still hectic just trying to fill our plates. I also found it bizarre that you had to cross the outside pool area in order to reach breakfast (at least, you did if you were staying on one side of the hotel) - walking on wet tiles with a loaded tray is not a lot of fun.The fridge in the second room was not working properly and the maintenance man did arrive promptly to fix it. However it still didn't work after that, and we had put milk in there, which went 'off' as it had not been kept cold. I reported it again to reception - they said they would replace both the fridge and our milk. In the event, they only replaced the fridge.We had prepaid for our rooms months ahead of time, and did not use room service, the phone, or any other hotel service, so when we checked out, the receptionist confirmed there was nothing to pay. However, a charge of $3.50 later appeared on our credit card bill. We are guessing here, but we think this was the price of a bottle of water offered for sale in the room. Now, it might be a genuine mistake - the housekeeper may have noted it against the wrong room number. It's a small amount but I don't see why I should pay for something I didn't have. I emailed the manager of the hotel about it. At time of writing this review, I have been waiting three weeks for even an acknowledgement of my email, let alone a proper response to my query.

What a shame the photographers have used tricks to make proportions appear larger than reality! As Europeans, we are used to small hotel rooms, so didn't take much notice of previous reviews! What a pity......The Brickbats:Having stayed at the Aqua Palm Waikiki five years ago, we chose the Hyatt Place at £300 more for five nights because wi-fi availability means we don't have to lug a heavy laptop around with us and mess about with plugging in LAN cables. Having paid so much more for the hotel, and having seen the wonderful picture gallery, we had set ourselves up for disappointment:1. The ""King Bed"" Room was pitifully small with hardly any drawer space to keep anything. A large safe occupied a corner of the wardrobe which restricted the useable hanging space. The sink area had a very small surround to keep toiletries and there was no spare space at all in the separate toilet/shower cubicle. To store our suitcases which we kept tripping over, I pulled the single seat sofa away from the wall to create a space behind. The room was okay for a one or two night stop, but for a short holiday was unbelievably cramped - even by our European standards.2. Breakfast is okay-ish, but nothing special, and is served adjacent to the swimming pool area - a veritable wind tunnel. The coffee is, however, terribly, terribly bitter and quite undrinkable. (Allegedly, the coffee is Starbucks Napoli) and we ended up buying ""Kona"" instant coffee from the ABS store and brewing up in our room. Whilst I would agree that breakfast can be a ""zoo"", that is going to be the case wherever ""free"" brekkie is included - get there early, then you won't have to jockey for position! 3. Whilst on the subject of the swimming pool and surrounding loungers - the pool and adjacent area is tiny! Everything in this hotel is tiny! In fact, it's almost as if the hotel has done the bare minimum to achieve its 3 star rating, working towards 4! 4. It took three days for us to discover the ""water scam"". When the room is cleaned, two bottles of water are placed next to the TV. A card on them reads ""Welcome"" ""We want you to enjoy this water.......blah...blah"". If you read further, you will see that it costs $3.50 per bottle - a 700% markup on the price being charged at the ABC Store! Reception did credit one day's worth of water to our bill, but being taken for a ride is never pleasant and I'm afraid that for the sake of making a fast buck, I would be reluctant to ever return to ANY Hyatt owned property!5. The Property Location at the Diamond Head end is okay. However, we found the Aqua Palms better as one didn't have to negotiate clusters of smokers outside each Hotel entrance as we walked to the beach. The road with the Hyatt Place has quite a few hotels and tourist bus pick up points, and each one perpetually has a group of smokers blocking the pavement. This, I suppose, is the flip side of hotels banning smoking inside the buildings and doing away with smoking rooms. The Positives:1. The Staff were wonderful and seemed genuinely eager to ensure we had a good holiday.2. The hotel was clean and comfortable. Towels to take to the beach were thoughtfully provided, for the asking. (You only have to ask the pool staff and they will sign them out).3. Late check out was arranged for $100. Even though our room was required for an incoming guest, the receptionist worked her magic with the computer to juggle bookings around so that we could remain in our room until 4.30pm for our evening flight.On balance, then, the holiday was enjoyable because of the staff and because it is Hawaii, after all! If we return, it certainly won't be to Hyatt - unless they replace their marketing director!","Bracknell, United Kingdom","bealine</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bracknell, United Kingdom</strong>",30,2.0

We usually stay at the Regency Resort, but decided to stay at this newly renovated Hyatt Place since we could save a bundle of money.This is a hotel not a resort. It's important to understand that you won't have a resort fee here which can add up to over $150 for the week at most resorts. That saved us a bundle. Waikiki has a lot to offer as far as food, spas and beach access within a short walk( 2-10minutes) that we didn't feel we missed anything by opting to stay at this hotel over a huge resort. The Room:The room was very clean and new! No mold or beat up furniture. The bed was super comfortable and the pillows were perfect just like our favorite Hyatt Regency Resorts. Our room was on the small side, but perfect for a couple and we don't stay in the room for much other than sleeping anyway. There is no bathtub, only a shower which worked fine for us. We got the City View room which ended up being a very obstructed ocean view. The decor and room styling is very modern, but warm and comfy. The patio faced an apartment which would have been a problem if we could use the balcony and chairs, but it was so noisy when we opened the doors. This is not just this hotel so I don't see it as a negative. Waikiki is a loud place and you can't really escape it! I've stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Waikiki and it was the same thing. The Service:The room was always cleaned and clean towels were replenished. The front desk is friendly and welcoming and happy to serve you in any way possible. The bar was surprisingly well used and although we didn't have a drink, people seemed to be enjoying them self and conversation with the bartender. Free Breakfast:My husband and I thought it was good. It wasn't an outstanding 5 star breakfast, but it was really tasty and they had some good options including yogurt, fruit, pastries, cereal, miso soup, rice, bagels, English muffins and two different hot options each day. The photos on their website of the breakfast sandwich don't do them justice, they taste amazing!!! It's a free breakfast, your wallet will enjoy this in Waikiki! It's also easy to just get your day started and get going especially when you have a tour and can't wait at a restaurant. Overall It was well worth having!! Location:The only reason I give it a 4 star. It's a nice stroll down to the beach which is a 2 minute walk. It's a calm swimmable spot. Very nice. However, it's kind of a long walk to the main shopping and popular dinner spots. It isn't an ocean front resort and doesn't claim to be, but after a few days we felt the walk began to get a little tiring. Wouldn't make or break a stay, but something to consider. There is a parking garage with in and out rights caddy corner from this hotel. It's $80 for the week. Hyatt parking can fill up so it's a good option. There is an ABC store a block down, a board rental spot across the street in the Marriot and a nice place for dinner at the end of the block overlooking the beach. Other details: We only had to wait for the elevator once or twice, but never more than a 2 minute wait. Not a problem at all. Free wi-fi was fast and there is a convenient wi-fi station where you can use the computers and printer so you don't have to bring your own. Pool was small, but not a lot of people use it so you may have it to yourself. it's super clean and they have chairs and towels. You can take the towels down to the beach as well. Overall, it's a great hotel and we really enjoyed our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel especially to those who travel on a budget, but like the same quality of service, comfort and cleanliness that you would get at a larger resort.

We also picked it for its free breakfast and free wi-fi. The holel is located 2 blocks away from Waikiki Beach, but we did manage to get an peek-a-boo ocean view. The rooms are small, but cozy. The balcony is very small and not very usable. The a/c didn't cool the room as it couldn't keep up with the sun from the southern exposure. The employees were nice and the food at the free breakfast was fresh and plentiful. The hotel only has 6 self-parking spots which fill up by noon, so we were forced to pay extra to use valet parking. After bringing this to the attention of the manager, the manager only charged us the self-parking cost. (I have Diamond status with Hyatt, so I don't know if the manager would have been as accomodating without this.) If you don't have a car and don't mind not being right on the beach, the Hyatt Place is an nice hotel. But if you have a car and want a clear view of the ocean and Waikiki Beach, I recommend the Hyatt Regency Waikiki instead.

There are good restaurants near by though we typically ventured farther out for meals. It was very clean. Rooms were up to date and nice. Elevators were slow. Valet service was excellent. The public spaces are minimal. There is a nice outdoor dining area for morning breakfast and the food is excellent. But it is crowded and it was a bit of a pain to get a table. There is a nice little convenience store attached with food, drinks, beach items etc. I will mention without judgment that this hotel caters to Asian travelers and I believe well over half of the guests were from Japan. I noticed that there were special items at breakfast, Japanese speaking staff, and the store carried many items intended for Asian clients. Overall I would recommend this hotel. We did our beach resort on Maui during this trip and certainly enjoyed it much more. But Hyatt Place Waikiki met our needs for a conveniently located reasonably priced base for our Oahu adventures.

My previous stay was at the Hyatt Regency on Waikiki, which is about a 10 minutes walk from Hyatt Place. Hyatt Place attracted me for 2 main reasons -no resert fee with free WIFI throughout the hotel and free breakfast everyday! The front desk employees were nice and accomodating. I did have a housekeeping problem and once it was brought to their attention, it was fixed. I stayed for 6 nights and the hotel did their best to change the main attraction of food each day. If you don't want to eat breakfast at Hyatt Place, just take a coffee/tea to-go and there are other places to eat close by; I found the convenience of the breakfast a highlight so I didn't have to worry about food first thing in the morning but to enjoy my lunch and dinner out of the hotel. Tip - sit under the covered part of the breakfast area. They have an excellent map and very easy to follow. The pink trolley which takes you to Ala Moana Shopping Centre can be caught one block down ($2) and the public bus can be caught a few steps in front of the hotel ($2.50). There is an ABC store half a block from the hotel where you can buy water and alcohol to stock up the fridge in the hotel.

We would stay here again but for our 2nd visit we wouldn't mind trying another hotel with similar price range to compare!!Location - the hotel is at the end of the main strip (Kalakaua St/Ave - may have spelt that wrong!) but it is only a short easy walk to it all (eg. where the International Market is located). If you join any tours, the pick up is usually at the Aston Waikiki hotel which is a 2 min walk to the corner of the street. There are ABC Stores everywhere! So purchasing snacks/water etc etc is easily accessible.The room/hotel - average size room (we had a queen bed) but it was clean and tidy! The bathroom had the standalone shower (not a shower head over the bathtub) which is definitely preferred. Good to return to each time after the beach or a day out from shopping! The hotel provides complimentary breakfast which was pretty good and serving starbucks brewed coffee!!WIFI internet - excellent. No connection issues and speed was not an issue also.Service - excellent! All very friendly staff and willing to help. The Expedia Concierge desk staff are also lovely to speak with and provides good recommendations. Some tips:* don't swim at the beach that is right at the end of the hotel street. It has like a safety wall that maybe seperate swimmers and surfers. We were stung by jelly fish in this area and thought maybe perhaps they come in with the waves but cant get back out because of this wall!!* swim bit further down where there is no wall! in front of Grand Hyatt was nice!* the Expedia Concierge recommended the luau at Paradise Cove - excellent choice! * if you want to do some snorkeling, the Expedia Concierge recommended the EO Waienea Tou - a day out in a catamaran which takes you out to sea to snorkel and see dolphins and turtles. This was tour was amazing! It is also a family operated business which makes it more personal and a great experience. * eat at The Cheesecake Factory - food is nice and their cakes are delicious!* don't be fooled by the queues outside Eggs n Things!

I paid for a City View base room and was pleasantly surprised when the guest check in liaison, Kimberly, upgraded us to the Penthouse level with a deluxe room! This was on the 20th Floor and had views of the city plus the mountains, it was breathtaking.The room was quite spacious with 2 queen beds and a lounge area. There was even a balcony that had two chairs and a small table. The room was very clean and very modern with a luxe feel to it. Most Waikiki area hotels say they're on the beach, but they are actually across the road. The Hyatt Place is literally 2 minutes walk to Waikiki Beach. You can see the beach from the entrance to the hotel. They even give you beach towels which was and added bonus! There is a free continental breakfast everyday on the 3rd Floor along with the hotel's pool. The pool was simple and small but who needs a pool when you're a splash away from the beautiful Pacific! Other reviews complained about the breakfast and the pigeons. The breakfast area is an open are to the outdoors hence birds are about. Once you stay with your food, the birds don't bother you, however if you walk away for a second, say byebye to whatever you had on your plate! Breakfast was filling, ranged from french toast, to eggs and bacon. There is a selection of breads and bagels along with cereals and also 2 types of pastries. The nice thing about this hotel is that there is a tray in your room that you can bring down, should you wish to take your breakfast back to your room. I've not stayed at any other hotel that offers this. There is also a Gallery Menu in the lobby area which serves up a variety of food items at reasonable costs. Happy hour is also on daily from 4-6PM. Oh, and there is a 24HR fitness center (very nice and spacious) and a guest laundry (3 washers / 3 dryers). The laundry takes coins and credit cards. $3.00 per wash, $3.00 per dry and $1.50 for detergent.The rooms do come with bottled water at a cost of $3.50 each, but 1 minute away from the hotel is a convenience store, ABC Stores, with bottled water at 99cents. Along with great souvenirs, snacks, drinks, food, medicine, actually anything that you will want or need and at great prices too!The hotel is actually centrally located, you can walk to the Honolulu Zoo ($14 entry), small but nice, and all restaurants and shopping is right around the area.

Service is friendly, attentive and helpful. Everything necessary for a comfortable relaxing vacation stay is available. In truth though, who goes to Hawaii to spend a lot of time in the hotel, unless it is specifically a beach side resort (which Hyatt Place isn't). We reserved two rooms through Expedia, one of which was to have two separate beds. Upon arrival we found that the two bed room was actually one bed and a sofa bed. This was an inauspicious start to our vacation and only after some discussion were we offered a two bed room at an additional charge. In our opinion, the hotel should have honored our explicit reservation and found a solution without additional charge. Somebody forgot that saying about ""the customer is always right"". The rooms themselves were very comfortable with all necessary amenities. We didn't find the beds hard, on the contrary, we found them to be very good and somewhat on the soft side. Nor did we hear any outside noise. In the smaller room there was a rather unpleasant odor that seemed to stem from improper cleaning. It seemed dissipated after we opened the window (or perhaps we got used to it).The hotel rate included breakfast and this was nothing to write home about. Not that there wasn't enough to eat or it lacked variety, but the culinary standard was low (including what seemed to us to be powdered eggs). We've had much better breakfasts in lower class hotels elsewhere. Perhaps it's all part of the culinary wasteland that is Honolulu. One reviewer mentioned being rained out at breakfast, since most of the tables are on an open terrace. This happened to us too and is not a great way to start the day. The same terrace houses a small swimming pool in a relatively uninviting environment. Go to the beach!The hotel offers parking at $18 a day (or more expensive valet parking). It's cheaper to park across the street at a nearby hotel for $15.All in all, the hotel lived up to our expectations and we enjoyed the stay.

No matter what floor you are on the noise level from outside is quite considerable even with all doors and windows closed and the AC on. This is not the first Hyatt I have experienced this in it must be something about their construction. The AC whilst mainly quiet suddenly sounds like it builds up a head of steam and spouts out a 30 second loud wailing sound. This happened in both rooms so it must be general.Our second room also had a small layer of slime around the bath and sink areas nothing serious but noticeable.Ok that's with the negatives now the positives.Both rooms offered were large with two queen beds which were comfortable. They are well equipped with a fridge, ours did not work one day and was replaced, coffee machine, television, balcony, safe and free WiFi.

Hotel is very modern but the first room we had was tiny and the bed far too hard. Had a mountain view. Breakfast is ok with lots of choice until it rains and then there is nowhere to sit without getting soaked :( Pool is small but ok and was a bonus to be able to use the hotel's laundry. Staff very helpful. Location is ok and the bar food is great and very reasonable.After the cruise they upgraded us to a King Suite I think they called it on the Mezzanine floor which was huge!!! The bed was enormous and it was nice to have a separate sitting area too - wish we had this room first as I was seriously thinking of cancelling our booking post cruise.Overall a decent hotel,"Adelaide, Australia","Welshcake038</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",26,3.0

The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are nicely appointed, extremely clean and safe, but on the small side. A standard room with King bed, was large enough for two people, but not for more than two. We had a mountain side view room, but wish we had not paid extra for the view, as we were not in our room all that much. DO NOT pay extra for a view, at Hyatt Place. It's not worth the extra bucks.Self-Parking was an issue (always full), so we relented and paid the extra for valet parking. The valet staff was more helpful than the concierge, as far as driving directions and things to see. Other reviewers have complained about the $28 valet parking fee. This is in line with ALL major city hotels. (San Francisco charges $50+ a night for self-parking, so quit complaining!)The valets were especially helpful when it came to directions and things to see. They were actually more helpful than the concierge.Concierge--there was only 1 and they were always busy. He was not especially helpful. A hotel this large and this busy, should have more than 1 concierge on staff.FREE breakfast is a huge plus, as there are not many eating establishments nearby.Many reviewers have commented on the pigeons in the outside dining area. Yes, there were pigeons, but they were not on tables, the buffet line, or trying to steal food. The manager was vigilant about squirting water on them, to keep them out of the eating area. What folks seem to forget....THIS HOTEL IS IN A BIG CITY, there will be pigeons if you are sitting outside! There are places to eat inside the lobby. The hotel provides trays in each room--if the pigeons bother you, take your food to your room and eat. There weren't many restaurants within a short walk from the hotel, other than those located in hotels, or chain restaurants. This was a little disappointing, as you'd think there would be more options for eating out at night. We were usually too tired by evening, to fight Honolulu traffic to eat out. The Tiki Bar and grill, at the Aston was an okay option. The beachside tables were great. The food about average. If we ever return to Oahu, we would probably choose to stay out of the congested downtown/Waikiki Beach area. Honolulu traffic is worse than Washington, D.C. beltway traffic or Atlanta during rush hour! Keep that in mind, if you need to be at the airport, Pearl Harbor, or anywhere else at a specific time, during the week. Leave extra time for getting to the airport!Overall, the Hyatt Place is extremely clean, exceptionally safe (you cannot use the elevator without your key) and good location. It's a great choice, if wanting to stay near Waikiki Beach.Keep in mind, the rooms are small. If you're bringing a family, opt for a deluxe room or two rooms. There is no bath tub, only a shower. This was fine for us, but families with small children might want a tub. I would probably choose to stay elsewhere, if I return to Oahu. But, for a first time visit, the Hyatt Place was a good choice.Great place for couples to stay, near Waikiki Beach.","Clemson, South Carolina","TigerFam3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clemson, South Carolina</strong>",7,4.0

While i have no real complaints about the hotel, it was clean, quiet, freshly remodeled, and a nice 2 minute walk to the beach.. there was nothing spectacular about it. I wouldn't stay there again, but only because I have stayed elsewhere on the island and have been much happier with the experience. Here are the things we liked/disliked about this hotel.1. Breakfast - This was the only reason to stay at this hotel. Nowhere in Waikiki (that I am aware of) offers a free breakfast. Breakfast varies daily and is wonderful and clean for a hotel breakfast. I have read some reviews about the birds being a bother, but if you've ever eaten anywhere in HI, you'll know it's not just this hotel. It is a beautiful place to start the day and with the cost of island food, a nice break. If you're looking to save a few bucks on your food cost - this is a good option.2. Location - About 2 blocks from Waikiki Beach. We paid to upgrade to a Diamond Head view - NOT worth it.. all we saw was the back of the mountain and wasn't anything compared to the view we had when we stayed at the Marriott across the street. It is a nice area of Waikiki though because it is not as loud and busy as the main strip - which is one of the reasons we picked this hotel in the first place.3. Room Size - SMALL rooms (even the ""upgraded"" room we had). They are clean an nicely decorated, but beyond that, nothing to write home about. Beds were very comfortable.4. Shower/Bathroom Lights/Fan - There is no bath tub, only a shower. Not a problem, but something worth noting. Also, the lights for the bathroom and the vanity area are on the same switch, so if you need to use the restroom in the middle of the night, be sure you can do it in the dark or you will wake everyone in the room.5. Staff - we never had much interaction with the staff beyond the concierge. The young man was not only not very helpful, but acted like we were bothering him. We were trying to obtain tickets to the Arizona Memorial and he was no help at all. He not only told us that if we got there early (5am) we had only about a 5% chance of getting tickets, but he wouldn't even look for $80 tour tickets for us. So, if this is something you plan on doing while you are there, make sure you book your tickets in advance. We were disappointed that we missed it because we didn't know you needed tickets years in advance. 6. Parking - Outrageous at $28/day. They say they have ""self parking"" for $15 a day, but they said to get those spots you need to park around 11 am/Checkout. Which, is pretty much when you will be using the car, so it makes it a useless prospect. Park across the street at the Banyan Waikiki parking garage for $15/day and they will give you a discount if you pay for the whole week. Kind of a lot of walking back and forth every time you need your car (and a roundabout way to have to get the car out and back to the hotel) but worth it to avoid the price of their valet. 7. Etc. - They offer no sort of snorkel rental or any sort of check out service, so be prepared to be buying everything you need, unlike some of the other hotels... this can add up fast. In conclusion, if you are looking for a clean, comfortable place to stay and save a few dollars on breakfast, this is a great spot. If you are used to a resort experience - or looking for a resort island/beach experience, look elsewhere.",,social_travlr,7,3.0

Very good breakfast every morning starting at 6:30 a.m., in spite of pidgeons that other reviews warned about. We had a city view deluxe room on the top PH floor that was spacious. Wifi worked well. Staff especially Angeline was very helpful in giving tips for local restaurants, transportation etc. We hiked Diamond Head one morning and walked all the way back to the hotel. One thing that might help is to be advised that they cannot guarantee locking up your luggage in secure area. We checked out noon and took taxi at 4:30 p.m. Fortunately, they took it and put it in secure space, but I guess they will not guarantee that is possible with lots of guests checking out. Even with our expressed concern about laptops, ipads, etc. they would not lock it up for you, instead hotel will tie up with cable lock and leave in lobby area. Also, take Charley's taxi they have fixed rates to certain destinations, like airport. For $29 to airport one way for four people was great! Sat at the bar for happy hour discounted drinks.

Staff were friendly and very helpful.I had to ask for fresh pineapples that had not touched the melons as we had an allergy to melons. The staff, especially one girl by the name of Monique was awesome in accomodating our request. She recognized us every morning when we came down for the free breakfast and asked us when we would like the pineapples.Only thing is that you have to be careful about the pigeons. There are plenty of warning signs about not leaving your food unattended but people still did that and the pigeons are quick to go after your food. Parking at any of the hotels in Waikiki is pretty expensive but we made other arrangements close by. We found parking at the Waikiki Banyan apartments only 1/2 a block away on Kuhio for around $15 per 24hr period. I can't remember the exact amount, I just remembered that is was much cheaper than the $25 per day parking at most of the hotels in Waikiki.","Vancouver, Canada","racerboy88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",13,4.0

The pool was small and basic but seriously your in Hawaii so you don't really care for the pool, the gym was a but of a let down with not much to offer there at all but it wasn't a deal breaker. The breakfast was probably the one let down of the experience. I had set he bar pretty high for the buffet style breakfast and was well disappointed, the food was all starchy and the coffee was pretty average also. The staff who do bookings are great though and suggested some awesome activities for us to do which helped make our trip.

We arrived around 1:30 and talked to the valet guys. They gave us the last self parking pass and told us where to find the parking garage. Self parking is $18 per night. We parked in the garage and attempted to check-in. We were told our room wasn't ready yet (no problem), so we headed to the beach, which is only two very short blocks away, and grabbed lunch and did a little browsing. By the time we returned (around 3:15) our room was ready. Our room was on the 14th floor with a partial mountain view. I read several reviews and checked out several photos prior to booking, so I knew the room would be on the small side and the mountain views would be partially obstructed by other hotels. Again, not a problem. The room was clean, the bed comfortable and road noise not an issue. Several people have commented in their reviews that the pigeons are bad in the breakfast area and that the elevators are slow. I didn't find the pigeons to be as bad as everyone said. They just walked around. I didn't see any fly up on to tables or pick food off of people's plates. As far as the elevators, one time we may have waited four or five minutes around breakfast time, but the rest of the time we waited for a minute or two.Self parking worked out well too. We got back to the hotel late one night and all the spots were full. My wife talked to one of the valet parking attendants while I waited in the parking garage and they walked with her back to the garage to show us what other spots were available for us to park in. Essentially they opened up their handicap and one reserved spot for anyone to park in. Other than that, we had no problems parking any other times. What more can I say? The free hot breakfast was great each morning and the staff was friendly.","Round Rock, Texas, United States","Daniel R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Round Rock, Texas, United States</strong>",1,5.0

There's plenty of seating to the front and side of the lobby area, plus a bar, a business centre and gift shop to the side and rear of the hotel respectively.At the reception desk you are greeted with a friendly Aloha and checking in was professional, quick and efficient.Our room was a deluxe ocean view which was on the 20th floor. The room comprised of a bathroom with a sink and walk in shower, plenty of clean towels and a hairdryer. A sofa in the lounge area (which doubles as a sofa bed), a coffee table; a study desk to the rear of the room and a massive king size bed with a dressing table and large LCD TV to the side. The room also has an ironing board, iron, safe and a refrigerator in the room for you to use.The ocean view from our room was amazing but I would ask for a room on a higher floor as the view might not be as good on a lower level floor.The hotels complimentary free WIFI was ok and a signal could be found in the room but it wasn’t the quickest, but definitely not the slowest either.Each morning between 6.30-9.30am there is a free buffer breakfast served on the 3rd floor by the pool area. The breakfast consists of cereals, bagels, muffins, fruit, toast, juices, tea and coffee, continental breakfast and scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages (varies each day). The breakfast is unlimited, tasty and filling which sets you up for the day ahead.Each Day our room was cleaned to a high standard by the cleaners, ready for our return.The hotel staff was very helpful, professional and courteous at all times. There is also an Expedia Agent onsite (Cameron) with whom you can book all your tours and tickets from. TIP (If you plan on booking a trip to big island make sure you pay the $10 extra each and fly Hawaiian Airlines and do NOT book with GO AIRLINES! THEY ARE VERY UNRELIABLE) but he will tell you this anyway.The hotel is ideally situated one block from Waikiki beach and the promenade. There is an ABC store next to the hotel which sells most things and open till 0030hrs.Don't bother taking beach towels with you as the hotel will let you take theirs to the beach or pool on confirmation of your room number.Talking of the pool, it isn’t the biggest. The pool is 3ft deep at the shallow end and 1.5m at the deep end and is roughly 15ft wide by 45ft long (approx).On the third floor there is also a laundry room with washing machines and tumble dryers (not free to use), there is also a small gymnasium next to the pool area (which is free to use).We did not drink at the bar but they did do a happy hour daily between 1600-1800hrs where draft beers are $3.50 and Mai Tai's are $5.If you are bored of the sun and beach the hotel does have activities throughout the day for you to try if you wish.The only negatives that I could find with the hotel were:-The birds! During breakfast time they will swoop down and eat any food left lying around either on the floor or the tables, but you get used to it after a couple of days. Just make sure someone is sitting at the table and they won’t bother you. This problem however isn't really the hotels fault and the staff do try to move the birds on during the breakfast period.There are two lift in the hotel which can be slow during busy periods i.e. breakfast and late evening. My advice is to get on the lift whether it’s going up or down then select your floor once you’re on it otherwise you will be waiting a while.On the whole the pros far outweigh the cons and The Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach is definitely value for your money.

Which in turn was on the same street as all of the shopping. Breakfast was so great every morning. I would consider it a breakfast buffet vs. continental breakfast. They also took into consideration that there is a large number of Asian guests and offered: rice, miso soup, kimchi, tofu and sweet pickles.

We loved the location--more toward the Diamond Head end of Waikiki, yet just a block and a half walk to the beach. Our plan from the beginning of our trip was to hike Diamond Head the first morning (knowing we would awake early!) & we were situated in the perfect locale to also even just walk to the base of Diamond Head (about 30 minutes) before embarking on the climb. We also really enjoyed several restaurants within walking distance on Kapahulu Ave just a half block behind the hotel. Uncle Bo's was recommended by the sweet gal @ the hotel who checked us in, & it was the perfect spot for our first meal in Hawaii. A taxi driver also recommended Waiola Shave Ice as the best on the island--we sampled shave ice on all 4 islands & still felt this was the best we had! And you are not too far from Leonard's-where you must sample the Malasadas. Back to the hotel--we thought the free breakfast was just enough. Although the fruit was the same every day (pineapple with a bit of cantaloupe) it was sweet & delicious. The oatmeal was a bit watery-but still fine. They changed up the hot items each day, which was nice--& my husband really enjoyed their coffee. Yes, it is a bit crowded & since it's not laid out in a linear fashion, you are always dodging people darting to & from the different counters. But there was never really a wait for anything & it just took a small amount of patience to not be bothered by the crowd. We LOVED the beautiful outdoor terrace where we ate each day. We always found a clean table under an umbrella--& yes, there were pigeons, but as long as you didn't leave your food unattended, they didn't bother you. We loved the beautiful open air lobby. Our room was surprisingly large--it was a corner room on the 11th floor & the balcony wrapped around the corner of the building so we could see both the Diamond Head view & the ocean view (both partially obstructed by other buildings...but still enjoyable). There was some street noise, even on the 11th floor, but we found it did quiet down after about 11pm & actually didn't keep up awake. The staff were very kind, friendly & accommodating. They recommended Charley's taxi for our ride from the airport & to the cruise terminal as Charley's offers a flat rate--very much appreciated this tip. We didn't use the pool, but it looked clean, although small, probably perfect for those with children. Overall--we were extremely pleased with this hotel & wouldn't hesitate to stay there again and/or to recommend it to others.

We were given room 1139 and I ended up with bug bites on the very first night. I had never had bug bites before and was a little confused the next morning, thought those were hives from seafood I ate the night before. The next day, those itchy red dots still there, I decided to ask the maid to change the bed sheets and still I got more bug bites. Went down to the front desk, showed them the bug bites and they decided to change my room to 1239, one floor up. Hurry up back to the room, packed and moved one floor up only to find out the very next morning the new room has a leaky AC unit that completely soaked the carpet around it. These room ACs shut off when the windows are open, thus we did not know about the leak after we closed the window and let the AC activated at night. Another trip down the the front desk, and again, we were told they could move us to a different room. At this point, I was tired from packing and moving and unpacking, I decided to stay at the leaking AC room and not using the AC for the remainder of my stay. I was utterly disappointed at the way the Hyatt Place handled the situation - I came and stayed in Waikiki to relax, not to pack/unpack/and pack again and got bitten by bugs inside room 1139. Maid service was also a little sketchy as they did not wipe bathroom counter or dust the furniture. One positive thing I should mention about this place is its breakfast. The Hyatt Place provides decent breakfast for guests; this alone almost gave them a second star...almost.","Sacramento, California","nnnle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, California</strong>",5,1.0

You had to ask at the tour desk which was always busy. So, all our bookings were done elsewhere.

We arrived early in the evening after a 12 hour flight and over an hour wait for the car. The hotel was easy to find. We were given two options for parking. The first was valet and the other was to park diagonally from the hotel. We were told there was self parking at the hotel but it was full. We parked across the street for all but one night. We used the valet parking one night. The attendant that night was friendly and took the car right away. The next morning our car was brought to us right away. Upon check-in we were greeted by Terrance (I hope the spelling of his name is correct.). He was very nice, professional and made the whole process easy after a long day. After checking us in he showed us all around the lobby, the small restaurant, computers, how to get to our room and other things available in the hotel.We were so surprised to find out that we were upgraded to a deluxe ocean view room. The room was large and very nice. The bathroom was large and had a walk in shower. The sink was just outside the bathroom. In the next part of the room there was a couch, chair and small table. There was also a large desk with plenty of plugs to use for our electronics. The refrigerator was nice to have in the room. Unfortunately, it froze everything we put in it. We had two queen beds that were very comfortable. The pillows were also comfortable. The TV was large and pivoted around so you could watch it no matter where you were in the room. The room was very clean and housekeeping was friendly. The WIFI always worked, was easy to connect to and was free.The hotel offered a free breakfast in the morning. It was one of the nicest we have been to. Each morning there was a different breakfast sandwich offered. The sandwiches were yummy. They also had French toast, waffles, cereal, toast, muffins, bagels, juices, coffee, yogurt and milk. They also had an Asian section at breakfast. The breakfast was held outside by the pool. There were a lot of birds around that people were annoyed with but I got a laugh at the them and enjoyed watching them.The pool was small but looked nice. We didn't go in. I read a lot of complaints about the elevators. We never had to wait for an elevator. The hotel was within walking distance to the beach and zoo. It was located away from the busier part of town and we had to trouble walking to shopping areas. There was also an ABC Store close to the hotel.This was our favorite hotel on our Hawaiian vacation.

This last trip to Oahu was number five for me. All stays have been in the Waikiki area. This hotel is on the far end of the Waikiki stretch. The trendier part of Waikiki is located more towards the opposite end. Those with mobility issues who like to shop the higher end stores would probably prefer a hotel in the Lewers Street area. The beach is only a few blocks away but honestly almost all hotels in this area can boast the same claim. Both the zoo and the aquarium are close by which is a plus for those with small children. Not all the rooms are the same size. Our room was a deluxe king with mountain view. The bed was comfortable. The room was large and included a sleep sofa. The decor was modern and seemed fairly new. Our stay was a month long and we never felt cramped or that the walls were closing in on us. The housekeeping staff was mostly pleasant with one lady in particular anticipating our needs before we had to ask for anything. Her unexpected kindness made our stay quite pleasant. There is a mini refrigerator in the room but no microwave. Wifi is free and easy to connect to. Our room had a small balcony overlooking the pool. Diamond Head was a wonderful sight to look out to but we could also see into some of the rooms in the other tower of the hotel. People really need to keep their curtains drawn at times! The sink was located outside of the small bathroom. This is not a location I prefer. The shower was large and clean with sliding glass doors. On the third floor is a laundry room, gym and access to the outdoor pool and sundeck. The gym is well equipped including providing headsets and extra towels. It is modern and roomy. The only issue I had with the gym is that guests from the other tower often use it as a route to the laundry area and the lobby instead of using the door closer to the elevators. This might not sound like a major issue but it is a distraction when one is working out and wants a little privacy. The sundeck features a gas fireplace which is lit each evening. It provides a nice quiet place to relax in. My husband and I brought our evening meal back to the hotel a few times and dined on this deck. Solitude is nice but piped in music might add a bit to the atmosphere. The pool area is small as is the pool itself. There are about eight lounge chairs located around it and it can get crowded during the day. Towels are kept in a cabinet and are plentiful! This pool area and sundeck transform into the breakfast area for the hotel's offered free breakfast skillet meal each morning. A tray is provided in the room so that one can bring the meal back to their room. Which leads us to the negatives. If your stay is brief than the breakfast is more than adequate. For longer stays the menu is monotonous. The daily breakfast sandwich rotates between two or three choices for most of the week with an occasional skillet of scrambled eggs and bacon added. There is hot and cold cereal. The same kind each day. Both plain (might be vanilla) and strawberry yogurt are served as well as a fruit bowl of pineapple or melon. Bagels and bread for toasting are also provided. A small selection of breakfast pastry alternates each day. The negative side is that the breakfast area is very crowded. It appears that the staff can not keep up with the demand for clean dishes. Many mornings I had to hunt for a bowl for my yogurt or a plate and would come up empty. Finding a table is sometimes very difficult which is why they provide a room tray. The problem with using the room tray relates to another issue, the elevators. The tray is a bit cumbersome especially if it is holding several breakfast items. The wait for the elevator can be lengthy so holding the tray is a bit of a challenge. Getting on a crowded elevator worsens the problem. Add that to the fact that one must swipe their card on the elevator reader to access their floor...well it gets tricky to say the least. The elevators are slow........very slow. The hotel utilizes them to hoist supplies up to the housekeeping closets which often leaves only one in service when demand spikes. Demand spikes often. The elevators are average to small in size. Even during the least busy times of day I had to wait ten or more minutes for the elevator to arrive. Breakfast time was often far longer. Our room was on the 12th floor and for the majority of our stay I took the stairs down. Down is not an issue as the stair door exits right outside the hotel. Going up one must take the elevator to the third floor where the stairs are easily accessed. Several times, when the line was exceptionally long a staff member would direct guests to the stairway that was normally off limit to anyone who was not staff. While the wait may not seem long over the course of a month the wait time would have taken at least a day off our stay. The stairwells are not air-conditioned making the climb up a bit strenuous.","Fall River, Massachusetts","Bostonterrio</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fall River, Massachusetts</strong>",13,3.0

We arrived from our flight from Las vegas and drove straight the hotel.

We turned off the air-con and left the door open to air out the smell. We decided to go back out and hopefully the smell would be eliminated by the time we got back.We came back to the hotel about 8pm, the room still smelled very bad so we called down to reception and advised them of this bad smell. We were moved 3 rooms down where there was no smell! Once in the room we noticed the air con was not working, again we had to call downstairs and the maintenance man came and changed the batteries in the wall.Breakfast - The breakfast is open plan next to the pool, you have a small choice of breakfast which also caters for the Japanese. My partner only had breakfast on the first morning as we were so put off!! There was a section of pastries , one of the pasties had a bird feather stuck to it, I am guessing this was from one of the hundreds of pidgins that walk around the outdoors eating area and hop onto the tables while you eat!!! Very unhygienic !When you have finished with your dirty plates and cups, there is a station in the middle of the eating area where you leave them, again.. unhygienic as the pidgins just sit and wait for people to leave their leftovers on the plates in this area!The hotel is situated within one block of the beach, the hotel also has an ABC store next door which is great as water in the hotel was expensive!","London, United Kingdom","ChrisTe2011</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",51,2.0

My wife and I were on our way to Bora Bora and decided to break up the trip a bit and overnight 2 nights in Honolulu. We used some points we had (I'm a Platinum Hyatt) member and stayed here for 2 nights. The staff is very friendly. No complaints there. The rooms are nice enough. We got upgraded to a bigger room and they also allowed me to check out later at 2 PM due to my Platinum status which was nice as our flight to Tahiti didn't leave until later in the afternoon.The location is good as you're literally 1.5 blocks down from the beach so it's super convenient. The hotel will give you beach towels to use. You just have to go down to the front desk to get them. They have umbrellas if it rains (it started raining on our last day as we were leaving to have our final lunch). The rooms itself are comfortable. Nothing really to write home about for that price but beds were comfortable. The only probably we had in the room was that some of the rooms are in a small corridor next to one another and people get confused on the room # and so we'd get people mistaking for our room. Not a big deal during the day when we aren't there. Kind of a big deal when it's 3 AM and you hear someone at your door. LOL.Our room came with free wi-fi which is nice in this day and age of every hotel charging for it. Also, the hotel came with a daily breakfast on the 3rd floor. However, it was VERY crowded and the food wasn't anything to write home about. In fact, after the first day, I got sick from something that I ate. I got a case of some Traveler's Diarrhea from something I ate there. So be careful here.The most frustrating thing about this place is the hotel is SUPER SUPER SUPER slow. We'd sometimes wait as long as 10 minutes to get on the elevator. A few times we decided to walk and keep in mind we were on the 10th floor. I'm not sure what is going on with those elevators but they were always always super slow. I think they need to be looked at.All in all this is a decent hotel in a really good location and friendly staff. Would I stay here again? Probably only if I was using frequent stay points. In fact, we fly back through Honolulu at the end of our Bora Bora trip for 1 night and although we have some points to stay here again we will pay to stay at the Sheraton.But if you're not going to be in your room much, want to be in a great location and have points to use, this could be a good option.FYI - a taxi from here to the airport was about $45 dollars. We took a taxi here and also one back to the airport.","San Diego, California","saintba</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",1394,3.0

My family of 5, which included a senior and a small child, couldn't have been happier with the short walk to the sites of Waikiki. The beach is just a couple of blocks away, the hotel is surrounded by restaurants and shops, and the zoo is a short walk. It was also a convenient stop for tours, which we used for an amazing luau. Two negatives: the street noise from my 3rd floor city view room was unbelievably loud, like the bed was in an intersection. Acoustic drapes may help. Also, the pigeons seem to run a muck in the breakfast area, comfortably grazing at the pile of used dishes (kinda gross). Still, the room and lobby area was clean, comfortable, and attractive. The service was also good, especially Terrence at the front desk and the concierge. I recommend this hotel.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Tropic0fCancer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",6,4.0

You also have to walk far to most shops. The location can't be helped so just be aware of this.The room was clean and tidy, the staff friendly.The biggest disappointment was the breakfast. The area is way too small and crowded for getting food. The seating is mostly outside in the area which is very windy - the hotel should consider ways to protect this area from the wind. There are not enough seats and we had to almost fight for a seat. The breakfast food was poor - it seemed like the eggs were powdered, for fruit there was only a melon and pineapple fruit salad and the coffee was tasteless. To top it off, you have to dispose of your leftovers like you are at McDonalds. The only good part was being able to take your breakfast back to your room, but getting back to your room means the your food gets cold. This leads me to the next issue: there are not enough lifts. We waited up to 4-5 mins for a lift at times.We have stayed in way better hotels for much less. I would class this hotel as only 3 star.","Auckland, New Zealand","GregP933</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",4,3.0

No sight of 2 beds like I reserved online and what I spoke to the reservation assistant about 5 weeks prior to coming to this establishment, which was said to be noted. This place is only looking for money and does not care about your needs or what you paid for. I cannot say I will ever come back to this noisey and jam packed hotel ever again.

We chose this hotel based on price, location and presentation of the hotel on it's website.We found that this hotel fit our needs very well. It was good value for the rate that we paid. Our check-in at 10:00 pm was quick. Allyson was pleasant, fast and efficient. Check out was equally easy and they stored our luggage on our check out date as we had a late flight. A guest key card is required to access the elevator which provides some security.We stayed in Room 1216, a Hyatt grand bed: Diamond Head Mountain View. There are 2 towers but I don't know what each of them were called. We stayed in the tower whose elevators were further away from the front desk.Pros:-The room is clean, modern with nice decor. Bed was comfortable and king sized- 42 inch TV with a good selection of channels and option for pay for view-Free reliable wifi throughout the hotel. I saw but didn't use the business center which had 4 or 6 computer stations.-Housekeeping was very good. Room was usually cleaned by early afternoon when we usually came back to the hotel.-Location was great. 2 blks from the beach, within walking distance of the heart of Waikiki. We enjoy walking and we were able to walk to Ala Moana Shopping center, Diamond Head and everywhere in between including the Honolulu Zoo and Kapiolani Park-TheBus stop is across the street from the hotel. TheBus was reliable and only costs $2.50 per trip. Always ask for a transfer which is usually good for at least 2 hours and use it to make stops or make your way back to your hotel.-Breakfast was fantastic. Healthy options. It was more than a continental breakfast with hot breakfasts. Choices include cold cereals, hot oatmeal, dried cranberries and raisans to add to your oatmeal, eggs, sausages, bacon, toasts, bagels, danishes, pancakes, french toast, yogurt and even miso soup, rice and kimchi. Tea, coffee, juices. Lots and lots to choose from. After we sit down for breakfast we would take a bowl of fruit, plate of danishes and a couple cups of juice with us and store it in the hotel room fridge for an afternoon snack. The area where breakfast is served is located around the pool and an outdoor patio. It is very windy during breakfast. I would suggest sitting close to the building, put your utensils on your napkins to keep them from blowing away and simply enjoy. However, we did see many people bring their trays from their room and took their breakfast with them. We usually had breakfast at 6:30 to 7:00 am and it is already quite busy. We always found a table because people are always moving. Watch out for the birds. There are signs everywhere that say DO NOT FEED BIRDS. They are aggressive birds so do not leave your food on the table. On more than one occasion we saw birds swoop down on a plate of food left on the table. -We didn't use the gym but we did go in to check it out. They have lifecycle machines which I am familiar with as I use them at my own gym. There were 3 or 4 treadmills, 2 or 3 elliptical machines, a couple of recumbent bikes, free weights, towels, a water cooler and scale. I was impressed and would have used the if I wasn't too busy walking.-we also did not use the pool but it was located by the gymCons:-we faced Kuhio street and the road noise could be heard quite clearly. I think in part it was due to single pane glass. The sound of the buses and the scooter were the most annoying noises rising up.-There was a gap between the door and window where the insulation is lacking. When the wind is blowing it sounds like you're in the middle of a wind tunnel. I think this would be an easy fix that the hotel should consider-No bathtub (just a preference thing)I hope my first ever review will benefit someone. I never thought anyone would be interested in my opinion but I know I rely on Tripadvisor reviews to plan out my trip regardless of how much or little info is given. Positive and negative reviews.

The location and the rooms lived up to expectations. The hotel is a couple short blocks to the ocean and Waikiki Beach. Our Ocean view room had a nice view of the surf and sand, was extraordinarily large and spacious, clean and had two very comfortable queen size beds - a rarity in the Waikiki area. I really wanted to love this hotel , BUT I WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE INCOMPETENT AND/OR POORLY TRAINED STAFF.Just to set the record straight, I have stayed in hundreds of hotels and while I care greatly about room cleanliness, comfort and conveniences, I really do not care a lot about hotel staff services as long as they meet basic needs. Here are some basic needs we had at the Hyatt Place that the staff and management failed miserably at:1. Our room was on the 17th floor with a great view, but also with an absolute need for reliable and regular elevator service. The tower we were in was served by two elevators. For the first day or two of our stay both elevators were in service and wait times were pretty average (1 - 3 minutes or so.) Starting on day three, the wait times increased tremendously (5-10 minutes) and lines formed at the elevator doors. After experiencing this a few times it was apparent that only one elevator was in service. The line for the elevator is immediately adjacent to the front desk, yet when I called the front desk to inquire whether there was an elevator out of service, the front desk staff said she had no knowledge there was any problem with the elevators at all. I explained the long wait times and what I had observed with only one elevator opening and closing on the first floor for several trips in a row and the other elevator not appearing even once. She said she would check into it. I guess she thought nothing of the mob of people standing next to the front desk waiting for an elevator and she certainly thought even less about my complaint as she never called back. After a couple days, both elevators were back in service and wait times were reasonable again. It seemed odd that the front desk would have no knowledge of an elevator problem, but it was to me the poorest of service not to try to communicate the problem to guests and let guests know that the problem was being handled.2. On site parking is provided at a not so nominal charge of $28 per day for valet parking. There is also self-parking for $15 per day, but upon arrival, we were told it was full. We love to explore while on vacation and thus having a car parked at our hotel is to us almost a necessity. So, I was okay with paying $28 a day for valet parking. Now when I think of valet parkinng, I imagine a system that involves me driving up to the enterance of the hotel and having a valet staff member meet me and take my cara to park without mush delay. When I need my car, I either call valet services or simply show up and a valet staff member scurries off to retrieve my vehicle in a few short minutes. Does this sound about right? It is not what you will experience at the Hyatt Place Hotel. Almost every time we arrived at the hotel to park our car, there was no valet staff in sight and obviously no one managing or supervising the operation. After waiting anywhere from 5 - 10 minutes, a staff member appeared and took possession of my car so I was then free to go about the rest of my day. Getting my car out was even a more absurd process. If you call down to get your car, expect to wait 15 to 20 minutes at times that are not busy and 30 minutes or more when it is busy. If you simply show up at the valet desk with your ticket, the process takes even longer some how! The valet staff appears to be understaffed and overowrked, not properly trained and clearly not managed or supervised. How tough would it be to get a valet parking maager to run the operation? Moreover, valet parking is right in plain sight of the front desk, yet complaints to the front desk by customers that I observed walking over to complain (and I was not amongst them) appeared to fall on deaf ears.3. We are a very on line family and wifi is a must have. Thus free wifi throughout a hotel is great as was the case at Hyatt Place until the hotel chaged to password for access (which they do every Moday apparently) and the hotel failed to let it guests know of this change. Okay I did get the new password after I realized the current one I was given only two days before had stopped working, but a well run and managed hotel would have either advised guests at checkin to call for the new wifi number on Mondays or simply would have given guests like us who were staying on for a bit both week's access codes or provided them when they changed. This one sounds pretty petty doesn't it? But it is indicative of a systemic problem at this hotel of poor management.Several times during my stay I questioned whether there was even any management staff at this hotel. I think that really says it all. There were other srevice issues, and I truly believe that with good management and training, this could be a terrific hotel. Right now because of a poorly trained or poorly motivated staff and the complete absence of management, I could not recommend a stay here.","Rochester, New York","kengor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rochester, New York</strong>",63,2.0

The staff was friendly and helpful. You are only a short block away from Kuhio beach which is has breakers to shelter the waters making it much gentler for kids. This also explains why the hotel pool is tiny.Free breakfast was very helpful to us as it took care of the ""Where and what to eat?"" question for us. The breakfast area can get very windy and crowded in the morning and pigeons are always on the lookout for a meal if you leave your plate unguarded.The free wifi was very strong and we never had a problem logging on. The lobby also had computers with free internetMinuses:The room (1411) on the top floor of the Diamond Tower was too small for two adults and a toddler. I thought that there would be a sofa bed and there wasn't. There was little place to store things and the bathroom had little counter space. The bathroom also only had a shower which is very difficult for bathing a child. Again that was not in the room description. For this reason alone I would not stay here again with my family.Do not bother trying to park at this hotel. Every night we were told that the lot was full and had to park at the Banyan lot which is kitty corner to the hotel. If I'd known that was going to be the case I could have paid $80 for a whole week.I wish this hotel had a room for guests to freshen up after checkout.

The rooms were adjoining so we could enjoy our family time.Both rooms had balconies with a wonderful partial view of the ocean and other towering hotels nearby. The flat screen TVs in the rooms were huge!! And filled with true HD programming. My parents enjoyed watching musical concerts on them.The bath is big and comes with slip-guard mat; big help with seniors in our group. There is also a retractable clothing line for drying swim suits in the tub. I saw an iron and ironing board, too. Coffee maker provided. There is a mini fridge for your convenience. And it WAS convenient for our leftovers and bottles of water.The hotel also provides free Internet access in the lobby on one of their complimentary terminals just past the bar. I did not try in-room access.Valet parks your vehicle for a daily fee $$. I believe you have to pay each time you drive out. But walking to the beach is easy—only 2 blocks away. A lot of shops and restaurants to see and try including sushi, Chinese, Thai to name a few.We hope to be back soon!","Phoenix, Arizona","Cameron J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",48,5.0

The hotel has a good price because it does not have many fancy services. For instance, there is no menu for room services; or minibar. At the hotel there is only two small lifts to take you to your room so in pick times you may need to wait a little bit longer to get in ;) The hotel provides you with a complimentary hot/cold breakfast at the pool (level 3), the breakfast it's basic and somehow it makes you feel at the school canteen, however the pastries offered are very nice.The location is really good, it's opposite to the Marriott and just a 5 min walking distance to Waikiki beach.In summary, I got a really positive experience and I will not hesitate to choose it again, although it's not a place for romantic getaways it's definitely a really nice clean modern hotel, located in a good spot in Waikiki.","Sydney, Australia","Olgs R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",10,4.0

I find Hyatt's customer service to always be top notch and the customer service at the Hyatt Place lived up to my expectations. I stay in them as often as I can. I saved up enough points to qualify for a free stay here so I figured why not. Here's why not:This hotel seems to be an old Holiday Inn or something similar with a Hyatt sign slapped on the front. The rooms, while ""updated"" still feel more motel-ish than hotel-ish. The walls and windows are paper thin and the noise level in the room was pretty high. We could hear everyone in the hallways as well as street noise below. Granted, there were a ton of young people staying there when I was there. The AC and refrigerator made loud noises too. All of this prevented us from getting a good night's sleep, which is extremely important to me when travelling. I will say that the bed was very comfortable. I am also a platinum passport member and I did not receive any options to upgrade. The free breakfast was awful. Cold ""egg"" sandwiches were gross. I guess if you just want cereal or something quick, it's a nice convenient option. Even my teenage boy who is always hungry passed on the breakfast after the first day. The coffee was good and they did have to go cups. The fruit was good also. The breakfast eating area by the pool was pretty dismal too. There was nothing nice about it at all. The pool itself was tiny and not somewhere I would want to lounge. The location, while only a couple of blocks away from the main strip and the beach, felt just a little seedy to me. Honestly, for about $100 more a night, you can stay at the Regency and be treated like royalty.

Once I said self-parking was ok, the guy promptly gave a folder with a map explaining how to reach the garage (which is in the very same building of the hotel, but considering the traffic one has to drive around the block to reach).After parked, I checked-in. It was soooooooo easy, fast and the guys were always smiling. Got my ocean viwe room at 14th floor, with an amazing view. Wifi worked properly in every corner of my room.Bed was comfortable, shower had a great water pressure. Toiletries were good. Towels were great, big and seemed to be new.About breakfast: they had the very same options you will find in every Hyatt Place in US. Some pancakes, some breads, pastries, butter, cream-cheese, orange juice, yogurt... The only problem is that it is really windy there! How to make it better: there's a tray in everyroom. Take this tray down to breakfast area, pick up all the food and drinks you want, and move back to your room. If you have an ocean view room, it's even better up there than downstairs... And don't worry, it's not ""forbidden"" to do that... they even encourage guests for it...The beach: about 100m from the hotel, you can find some white sand, calm, blue and warm sea. And they even offer you some beach towels (ask for them at the front desk).Don't forget to stop by any ABC store (there's one just beside the hotel) to buy some food and drinks.

On arrival we were too early for check in (understandable) but left our luggage and returned after lunch. It then emerged that there had been confusion with our booking, and only 2 of the 4 rooms had been booked. Staff sorted this after a while and apologised for the mix up with 'complimentary breakfast added to the duration of your stay'. Upon entering the room, we found that the breakfast is complimentary for ALL guests so we hadn't actually been compensated at all. The staff at check in, although polite, werent all that informative. We hadnt understood that there were 2 towers to the hotel, so lugged our cases all the way up to the right floor in the wrong building to figure out we weren't in the right place. Back down we go! The hotel is right next to waikiki beach, so great for beach fans. I was extremely disappointed in the pool area here. I prefer to spend the day away from the beach in order to get some shade if needed. Tiny tiny pool, not what I'd expect from a 4 star hotel, so unfortunately spent a lot of time in my room reading with nowhere else to do it. If there is anything about this hotel I feel NEEDS improving is the breakfast area. There are pigeons EVERYWHERE around the seating area. Small amount of tables, so it is recommended that you bring a tray from your room to collect breakfast and then return to eat there. We did this every morning we ate there, as I do not enjoy pigeons landing beside me on the tables and chairs. I really feel there should be a net or some sort of preventative measure taken against them if that's where the Hyatt has allocated for their guests to eat.

The first time I was so happy with it I just booked it again without even looking at other places. This time I was still happy but there were a few things that weren't ideal so while I definitely wouldn't rule out staying there again I'd probably look around first.Last time we were in the Diamond Head tower. This time we were in the Pali tower and I think that might've made all the difference. The rooms (our party had two) were just as nice and big but were really noisy. The air conditioners in both rooms sounded like freight trains. I live in the inner city and have never thought of myself as noise sensitive but this really bothered me. I asked reception about it and was told that all the rooms in Pali had that problem. If it's a known issue effecting the whole building, why would it not be fixed? They did kindly offer to move me to the other building but the other problem with Pali is that there are only 2 elevators so you often have to wait for ages - so to get to the other room if I moved would've meant going down in the Diamond Head elevator and back up in the Pali one. So I stayed put and after a couple of nights of trying to get used to the air con noise I just turned it off at night. Also, and this isn't huge because we weren't in the room watching tv much but I'm sure there were better channels on our last trip - seemed like most of the channels now were 24/7 infomercials.Something that drove me insane and I would've thought could be easily fixed was door slamming - this was constant late at night and early in the morning. Unless people carefully closed the doors - and seems no one does - they slammed so loudly that all the furniture in the rooms would shudder. They have closing mechanisms that probably just need to be adjusted.The other problem that really impacted our trip - and not sure what the hotel could do about it - was that there was a school band group staying at the same time as us who were really noisy in the halls, stairs, etc. The night they checked in there was a fire alarm in the middle of the night and the whole building was evacuated onto the street. It wasn't fun being woken to a loud alarm and having to walk down hundreds of stairs and then back up them afterwards (would've taken an hour for everyone to get elevators) when it was determined that someone had triggered the false alarm but I REALLY felt bad for all the elderly people and people with babies and small children.On the good side, all the staff were nice, rooms are very nice and big, breakfast is good - we were there for 10 days and went at all different times and it was never too crowded or low on supplies.",Australia,"jayarbee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",48,4.0

My wife and I spend a lot of time setting on the Lani just relaxing and the view from this room was right into someone's private residence. The front desk immediately upgraded our room with a much better view. Chris who also works at the hotel was kind enough to show us some other rooms to help us make a better decision on where we will stay next visit. I have seen some complaints on the breakfast that was being served at the hotel. I must say that the FREE breakfast was great! When you consider what it would cost from breakfast at McDonalds on Oahu this saved a considerable amount of money. And the breakfast was GOOD!

I already know we will have a bad stay when we checked- in, she wasn't very helpful and friendly. Asked her if we could check out late because our flight is not till 9 pm the next day. Katherine immediately said no they are fully booked, I know they are not because I booked this hotel the night before and they had the room for us. I asked her if I can shower somewhere after I can go to the beach and said no right away, she said we have a bathroom where you can change. Checked in our tiny small room, didn't have space for any of our luggage and a carry on. Tiny bathroom, but a nice shower. Bed is ok too soft for my taste with a heavy comforter. Big flat screen TV but hardly have any channels. I asked her for a higher floor and got 7th floor facing a wall and a pool view. The swimming pool is a joke very tiny with about 5 lounge chairs, but we didn't use it, went to the beach but my husband stayed in the room. The beach is about 3 blocks away. When I came back from the beach I went to the front desk, got a different girl. I told her our situation and told her I'm willing to pay an extra charge and she said no also but she offered a hospitality room where I can shower, from 3 till 3:30. To make my story short, next day we checked out at noon. They put away our suitcases where you can see it, our shuttle to the airport doesn't get there until 6:30 pm so we have 6 hour wait. I went to the beach and my husband decided to stay and lounge at the hotel where a lot of people are sitting around talking. Came back from the beach at 2 pm, my husband talking to a man and his wife taking a nap on the chair. My time comes up for hospitality room and took a shower, I get back my husband is not there look around didn't see him. I asked the guy he was talking to and he said his in a police car being arrested, didn't see my husband and I asked the police where he is at and he said he almost got arrested and the man from the hotel said he got kicked and saw my husband with our luggages a block away crying, mad and confused. My husband told me he took a nap lying on the chair while I was gone taking a shower and a man woke him up from his nap asking if he's staying in the hotel and asked him what room did he stay. My husband couldn't think what room we were in, he got waken up by this man harassing my husband and called the police on him! For what? We stayed there waiting for the shuttle, it was only about 3:30, our shuttle doesn't come until 6:30. Now we're standing in front of another hotel with our luggages nowhere to sit and my husband very upset and still crying and yelling at the stupid manager. You can see this manager should not work for any hotel because he has no customer service and no hospitality. He didn't kick out the rest of the people in there lounging and taking a nap. He discriminated and harassed my husband because he's black!! I will never stay in this hotel again, thank goodness it's only one day. By the way the free breakfast is ok, nothing to brag about.

After trying most of the Caribbean, we thought we'd give Hawaii a try. We stayed at the Hyatt Place Waikiki and overall, we enjoyed our stay. I'll break my review into the pros and cons.Pros:- Hotel is clean and renovated. As you can see in my pictures, everything is more than fine. Given that a lot of hotels in Waikiki looks like they haven't changed since the 70s, you can truly appreciate this place. Room was also spacious enough despite being on the 3rd floor (reading reviews, it seems a lot of lower floors rooms are small, but it wasn't the case here).- Location. While not centrally located in Waikiki (it is at the end of the beach), it has the advantage of being quiter than other hotels. It's only a 50-10 minutes walk to go to the heart of Waikiki to do some shopping or find a lot of restaurants. Walk 2 minutes and you have the nice beach, with no waves thanks to the man-made wall. The zoo is right next and you should visit it!- Breakfast is included and they allow you to bring food back to your room. I read a lot of negative reviews about the breakfast but I was very satisfied with it. Sure the selection isn't huge (don't expect a cook to make you an omelette in front of you), but I could always find something to eat. Our room was on the 3rd floor, literally 20 meters from the breakfast place. So we could wake up, take the tray (provided in the room) and go pick up some food and come back to the room. Really convenient. We always took more pineapple that we stored for later in the little fridge.- Huge HD TV and good wifi. While having a big TV isn't essential when you're in Hawaii, it was still nice to have such a big screen with so many channels (including HBO). Wifi was also a nice surprise as it was not only provided, but fast! Some hotels provide a really slow wifi. Not the case here and you can enjoy netflix in HD on your tablet without any problem for instance.Cons:- Some of the services don't work. For instance, there is supposed to be complementary remote printing. I tried many times (to print my boarding passes) but it never worked. When I asked for help, nobody knew. Ultimately, I had to e-mail my pdf to the girl at the front desk and she printed it herself. While nice, it'd be better if the printing had worked right away.- The concierge/excursion guy doesn't provide 100% accurate advice. Specifically, he told us that there was no way we could get tickets for Pearl Harbor without taking a tour. We believed him, especially given that the online site did show the tickets were sold out. But when coming back, we talked to other people and they told us that you could simply take a cheap shuttle and buy tickets over there. You had to be there early, but still. Given that this guy is from the hotel directly, you'd expect better advice.- The bathroom is split in two, with the toilet/shower in a small room, while the vanity is out of this room, without a door to separate it from the main room. This isn't very practical and we'd have preferred if there was a door.Overall, we both appreciated this hotel. It was a good value for the price with only minor complaints.

The view was mostly of the neighboring buildings, but (as many visitors forget) Waikiki is an urban environment, and you are in the midst of many other buildings. The room was actually quite quiet considering you're in the city, and sitting on the small balcony was pleasant in the morning. The room was nicely furnished, well kept and included all the usual amenities - coffee maker, safe, ironing board and iron. The free Wifi - standard at Hyatt Place - is always welcome (Why doesn't Hyatt adopt that across their system?) The freed breakfast in the morning is also a nice addition, the only drawback is that everyone in the hotel thinks the same thing so it's pretty crowded. This isn't a glitzy beach resort which is a good thing. Instead of never leaving the hotel pool - get out and see Hawaii!

And most of the reviews on this hotel was very consistent and most were positive. So we went ahead and booked this hotel and I'm so glad that we did. It was priced well for the location especially for the free breakfast. After staying here, I can finally provide my take on this hotel.Pros:- conveniently located next to the shopping districts and walking distance to all the main attractions- ABC store is right next door- hotel is a short block or two at the end of the main shopping areas so you're not in the middle of all the crowds- lobby was small but very impressive and modern deco- room we stayed in was a deluxe room and it was much bigger than I expected. there was a lot of room and can accommodate a family of four very comfortably- room was clean and it came with free toothpaste- free daily breakfast- mine fridge is always a plus- big entry way when entering the roomCons: - AC in the room can get noisy each time it starts up. We had ours on automatic. - you can hear some of the street noises- check-in driveway is small- hotel parking is $15/dayOverall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to save $$ and still stay at a decent, comfortable hotel. It's perfect for families especially for the free breakfast. If you want to stay at a good hotel and don't need the resort experience, this is the place.

Free breakfast was big enough where most days we did not eat lunch. Between the breakfast and skipping a few lunches - that was a great money saver. They also Expedia personal in the lobby to help plan things to do. They were great also. They never pushed you into anything and were willing to make last minute phone calls to get things to work out.

The hotel is a short, safe two block walk from the beach and all the shopping and restaurants Waikiki has to offer. We called a month before our stay to request a higher floor away from the elevator as suggested on other reviews and received a room on the top floor (PH on the elevator) in the corner as we requested. The rooms were recently updated with a very nice, clean feel to them. The only downfall of this hotel is the street noise which could still be heard from the top floor and the limited views being two blocks from the ocean. We still had a nice view of Diamondhead from the lanai (balcony) and I would not dismiss the hotel because of either of these things.Every staff member we came across was incredibly friendly and welcoming. There is a happy hour at the bar every night from 5-7 which we enjoyed a $5 Mojito from in the open air lobby. The pool area looked nice although never in use since the beach is so close. Beach/pool towels are available in the pool area so you don't have to bring them along. My husband (and I) loved the breakfast which included breakfast sandwiches, some sort of pancake/waffle/french toast, bagels & toast, pastries, yogurt with fixings, oatmeal with fixing, fresh fruit and Asian breakfast soup options every morning. We also took some snacks back to the room a few times which they didn't appear to mind at all. Staff members offered great advice whenever asked and even suggested the Banyan hotel across the street for the cheapest self park which we used for one day. The other days we simply parked a few blocks away on the street across from the park and zoo for free. Parking is limited here but we got lucky and saved some money which we're all for. All in all this is an up-to-date hotel perfect for those trying to make the Hawaii experience a bit more affordable with complimentary breakfast, wifi, in-room safe and more affordable parking options.

Their is no mini bar (not needed by us) and the shower was good (even if missing the bits to stop the water leaking out of the door !) There is a pool on the 3rd floor, that also serves as the breakfast area. Wifi is free and available throughout the building (letting us catch up after 18 days at sea).However....The staff seem very unhappy and completely non customer interactive. We had very little conversation that was not related directly to work. The Bar / food area took 20 minutes to provide a basic burger (that seemed to be made on 2 week old bread) and followed the first meal by 10 minutes....Breakfast had to be shared with pidgeons, who seem to infest the dining area. You need to have breakfast with two poeple, one to fend them off while the other eats - if you can eat the dried up offerings. The daily waffles and other bread based options were in-edible. The fruit was nearly all pineapple (you had to be up early to find the few pieces of watermelon or other items).

We received a complementary upgrade to a mountain view which was really sweet. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It is very clean, our housekeepers Leonida and Mirla did such an awesome job refreshing our rooms every day. The staff is always so helpful with our needs. The daily breakfast is also a good deal. The distance to Waikiki Beach is really great, and there are so many nearby restaurants and stores around.Now this is just a heads-up to the travelers: this hotel only has valet parking. We rented a car throughout this trip and my husband and I both think that might have been a mistake. PARKING is the number one issue when visiting this place. Luckily, heeding a fellow Tripadvisor's review and the hotel's valet staff, we ended up parking across the street at the Waikiki Banyan, which was $12/night. (Also available for $72/week, but we realized this after they increased the nightly rate to $15/night). So, it was really a crazy dilemma between $28valet at the hotel that we're staying at vs. $15 across the street, self-park. We spent $130 for parking alone. That was my only trouble with this hotel. If you are renting a car, be prepared to pay for this.Waikiki beach is a beautiful beach, but coming from a tropical country, I think it is average.

This time was a bit disappointing, especially since I was finally able to bring my wife with me.The staff seemed just a bit less attentive than previous trips - when we arrived to check in, there were two front desk staff chatting casually with a guest while we stood there awkwardly for several minutes waiting. Once we got to our room, I was a bit dismayed to see that we were given a rather small room - not the larger suite I was given on previous trips and booked for this trip. I was told this was an ""upgrade"" since I could see a sliver of mountain from the window. I would have traded view for space in this case. I called down pretty much every morning and was told that they weren't sure what they had available, or they weren't sure, or they didn't have anything.Breakfast was the standard Hyatt Place menu - some sort of breakfast sandwich that rotated every morning, along with fresh fruit (why does the pineapple just plain taste better in Hawaii?), yogurt, and assorted pastries/carbs. The coffee was actually very good and I always took a cup to go.Be warned ahead of time - especially if you've never been to Waikiki - it's a magnet for Japanese and other asian tourists. This is not necessarily a bad thing - I think it's great for the local economy. They do, however, come with a different set of rules and etiquette, particularly when it comes to anything where a bit of order might be expected. Lines are non-existent and people tend to either swarm, walk in front of you if they want something, or otherwise not pay attention to where they're going. Again, not ""bad"" - just different, and if you're someone who's used to order, this might throw you off some. With that in mind, it can make breakfast an interesting, free for all dining experience. The menu does tend to get a little old after a few days, but it's free, convenient, and if you're really tired of it, there are lots of other places in the area to walk to.I prefer this property because it's down on the end of ""the strip"", so it's a little less hectic than the properties smack in the middle. The Sans Souci beach is not too far, and from what I read, one the locals prefer. It's actually nice to be on one end of the strip because you can just walk down one way and back, making a clean loop.As with all other hotels in the area, the driveway is way too small for the amount of vehicle traffic that comes through. That can make getting a car in/out with the valet service a bit of a challenge at times. The valet staff also seemed hit or miss - hustling at times, disappearing at times.Another neat thing is that there's a pretty good bike/scooter rental right next door - my wife took a scooter one day while I was at work and promptly claimed that it was one of the top three days of her life - they were very friendly, polite, and took the time to cover all contingencies.Overall, it was fine for what we needed - a bed, shower, and free breakfast to boot. It was just a little ""off"" from my previous visits, and I found that a little disappointing.","Bethlehem, Pennsylvania","Alex B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</strong>",2,4.0

The staff here are equally as important to mention--everyone from reservations, valet, reception, housekeeping, bartenders, and cooks were extremely nice and seemed to be having a good time.

We ate french toast at the airport our last day in Hawaii and we all thought that was the best breakfast we had on vacation (if that gives you any indicator as to taste of the free breakfast buffet.)Beds - comfortable and not too soft or firm, good quality sheets, down pillows.Free Wifi - glad it's free but it's also quite slow. We used our hotspot most of the time instead.No Resort Fee - good grief why do hotels even have this charge? Thank you Hyatt Place for not squeezing more money out of your patrons.Beach Towels - just pick them up at the front desk, super convenient not to have to pack them.Beach Toys for Kids - they give you a complimentary beach pail set when you check in. Nice!Showers - love that you can change the spray on shower handle, good pressure and water was nice and hot! Plus there is a clothes line you can pull out/retract to hang swimsuits on to dry. Thank you! Mini Fridge - left empty so you can use it for whatever. We filled it with Diet Coke and water bottles purchased from Safeway up the road.ADA Compliant room - don't know why we got this room as we aren't in need of this, ended up being a perk as it is bigger than a standard room and the bathroom is larger too.Balcony - didn't expect a balcony at all, so this was nice even though we didn't really use it.Laundry Facilities - So convenient, especially if you have kids! $1.50 for tide, $3 to wash, $3 to dry.Exercise Room - conveniently located next to laundry room, so worked out while waiting for laundry to finish. They need to crank the ac in there as it got a little warm while working out.Teddy's Bigger Burger - right around the corner. Ate here 3 times it is that good - put cheese on your fries cuz you're on vacation!Bad Stuff:Noisy - they seriously need to upgrade to noise canceling windows as the street noise is nuts! Every night we were wakened by blaring sirens, and there was constant idling noise from diesel engines (tour busses, etc.) Hotel was fully booked so we couldn't change rooms to a quieter side of the hotel. I doubt it would be that much quieter though as Waikiki is full of activity at all hours.Incredibly Slow Elevators - we often opted to take the stairs as we were on the 4th floor. Everybody waiting for the elevators complained about this, including employees.Noise from stair well - our room was right next to stair well and we joked that it sounded like a heard of elephants as people opted to use stairwell due to slow elevators.Bathroom Vent - ours didn't work even though a maintenance guy said it was working (he pointed a flashlight to show that the fan was spinning - but there was absolutely no air flow or whirring noise and meant that our bathroom stayed warm and humid.)The good definitely outweighs the bad, and it's always better to know what to expect if you are considering this hotel for your vacation.

There is a tray in your room so you can get your breakfast and take it back to your room and eat. Location is exellent, a block from the beach, trolley stop on one corner and bus stop on the other, if you book a tour chances are the pick up is from the Marriott which is across the road or the Aston Waikiki which is to the left on the next block. The only downside is the lifts are terribly slow and the firestairs are metal not concrete so people using the stairs can be quite noisy. Our second week was spring break so the kids running from floor to floor up and down the stairs was annoying. Free wi fi was a bonus and taking my ipad was great and cheap way to stay in touch with home. The beds are soooooo comfortable.. We will defintely stay here again.","Sydney, Australia","catchfab</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",29,4.0

We got this hotel for a great price through priceline. First time we arrived, we were able to check in a little early but to our surprise the room we were given had a weird musty smell to it. I noticed a HUGE blood stain on the carpet next to the bathroom and we immediately went down to the front desk to request another room. I'm not sure WHY there was blood on the carpet but there was no way I was going to stay in a room that smelled and was tainted. The front desk apologized (and I knew she was embarrassed about this) and gave us a new room. Throughout our stay, I noticed small little bugs in the bathroom that were crawling around. My boyfriend said ""it's probably the island life."" I'm not sure if it really is normal or not, but for me it was unacceptable. Luckily, we were leaving in 2 days so I did not make a big deal out of it.Daily breakfast was good. It is the same stuff over and over but hey it's FREE! They do change up the breakfast sandwiches everyday though.Parking can be expensive, but we parked across the street for $12 a day which is a STEAL!You can borrow free beach towels from the hotel so save some space and don't pack your own.Location is the best thing about this hotel.

As a frequent Honolulu visitor, I have enjoyed many hotels there, but I would say this was my favorite. The staff is great. Very friendly and helpful. Being I was there for 14 days, many came to recognize me. Josephine, the housekeeper on my floor was a great plus to my visit. She tried to learn my schedule and clean while I was out. She was very friendly. I developed a fever one night and the next day, she made it a point of changing my linens. Reading some of the reviews before I visited, I was concerned about the room size, but mine was great. Very spacious and well designed. The bathroom itself is just a shower and toilet and rather small, but there is a nice vanity outside that makes up for it. The bed and sofa were very comfortable and there is a good sized desk and workspace. The breakfast was a great benefit. Very plentiful and the hot items seem to change frequently during my stay. The outdoor space was lovely, but just don't feed the birds.The hotel also had a very comfortable lobby; a four station complimentary computer station; a gift shop; a tour desk; a well equipped gym; a smaller pool (why use when I could take a short walk to the beach!); a coin-operated laundry and a sundeck. My favorite amenity was the lobby cafe. You could order food from their cafe menu 24/7 (sandwiches, soups, salads, deserts, etc), as well as a full size bar (never used). The staff there was great and I had some great meals. The location of the hotel was strong. Very close to the beach and near the Zoo and Diamond Head. My balcony gave me a nice view of the latter. The only downside I encountered was the elevator service. There were only two elevators in my 20+ floor tower. During breakfast or at peek times, you could wait a long time for the cars to come. Also, being that the housekeeping and maintenance staff are use these same two elevators, it created many traffic jams. Other than that, I would highly recommend this location. In fact, I have already booked my room for my next trip to Honolulu.","New York, NY","W731KBdavidw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NY</strong>",120,5.0

Our room was clean, modern, and upscale with plenty of space for our family. The fitness room was also clean and up to date with nice equipment. An added bonus is the tasty complimentary breakfast which serves both hot and cold foods. If you like the hustle and bustle of the marketplace and the strip, but don't want to sleep around it, you should consider this hotel.

Fresh towels at the reception any time of day and you can take as many as you want. For those that don't want to carry boogie boards, a convenience store located in the lobby of hotel rents them for $3 per day.

I am also in the travel service industry. I've stayed in 5-6 different hotels during our recent Hawaii trips. This was the best!We didn't want to get two rooms, wanted a decent view, wanted to be close to the beach and wanted separate beds for the kids. I researched on Trip Advisor, Yelp, etc., but ended up booking directly with the hotel for the best price which turned out to be with AAA. We got a Deluxe Ocean Queen. It had 2 queen beds and a full pull out sofa bed.The rooms were newly renovated and nice. There was a small refrigerator for snacks, water and soda. Wireless Internet is free! No annoying resort fee either. Staff was super, super friendly. Complimentary breakfast bar 6:30-9:30am daily. It consisted of breakfast sandwiches, waffles/pancakes, fresh fruit (usually a mix of pineapple and melon), yogurt, cereal, oatmeal, cottage cheese, granola, toast, bagels, orange juice, milk, apple juice, tomato juice, water, coffee and tea. Can get really busy depending on when you go. There is a wood tray in each room that some families brought down to take food back to their rooms.There are free computers for use in the lobby. Printing is also free if you need to print out boarding passes or tickets purchased online. Beach and pool towels down in a cabinet by the pool. No hassle, just grabbed as many as we needed.Lobby is totally open, but you need a room key to get up to the rooms. Safes are in each room as well. Felt very secure.Only downside is valet parking at $28/day. This is pretty normal for Waikiki though. The valet guys are super nice and earn their money. There is self parking diagonally across the street for $17-18, at the Banyan, but is very crowded and hard to park in. We ended up parking at the Hyatt. Like I said, this was the ONLY downside.This is a great place for families, especially if you don't fit into the 2-queen hotel room model.","San Luis Obispo, California","NMunozConsult</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Luis Obispo, California</strong>",28,5.0

The hotel provides beach towels and you may borrow, water wings, and water noodles for the kids. The hotel is close to ""The Wall"" an area on the beach where waves are blocked off so the water is shallow and clear, no higher than approximately 6ft. Great area for kids, bring food to feed the fish.Free breakfast every morning, bring your wooden tray from your room to carry all the dishes.

SO glad I chose to stay at the Hyatt place. I found them superior to most of hotels in town including those with much higher ratings. Most of the hotels in Waikiki were built in the 60s and 70s...and they look tired and worn.The Hyatt Place Waikiki is fresh and newly remodeled. It is about 2 blocks walk to the beach. Rooms above the 12th floor on the ocean side do get ocean views. I stayed on the 17th floor city side and yes, there is a good deal of city noise. If you are sensitive then ask for a higher floor.As one contributor mentioned, the Hyatt Place is more of a city hotel. It is NOT a resort with options like room service, a resort style pool for features like a kids club. Out of all the ""resorts"" in Waikiki there are only 7 that sit directly on the beach. Several of the larger resort style hotels, including the Hyatt Regency sit across the street from Waikiki and also offers a small roof style pool. Most travelers visit Waikiki for some time on the beach and to do sight seeing around the island of Oahu. For this purpose, the Hyatt Place is perfect. Daily breakfast is free here and very good...an egg dish, waffles, french toast, fruit, yogurt, miso soup. Bring along the wooden tray from your room to ease with the buffet. You can also grab bread, peanut butter and jelly for sandwiches for later if you are so inclined. They even had a full selection of my favorite tazo teas. The hyatt place is right next to an ABC store. These are mini marts found all over Waikiki that offer quick food shopping, snacks, soda, water etc. The Hyatt place also has a snack/bar area right in their lobby for a fast meal/drink. You are also steps away from Tiki's (restaurant at the Aston Waikiki Beach with the BEST coconut shrimp I've even had!). There is a wolfgang puck,s fast serve, subway & cold stone Ice cream right there too.The Hyatt Place also offers free WiFi in all their guest rooms. Many of the higher priced hotels charge about $15/day for guest room WiFi. The higher price came with connection problems that I never encountered at the Hyatt.Most of all the STAFF at the Hyatt Place are AWESOME. They show genuine care and concern for the needs of their guests. My flight didn't leave for home until 8pm. when I asked how much it would be for a late check out they graciously extended me to a 3pm check out without any charge. (and they didn't know I was a travel agent!) If you ask for directions, they give you a map, offer suggestions on public transit and even restaurant options without being prompted. Even housekeeping will always stop and greet you with an aloha and a warm smile. I will definitely recommend the Hyatt Place to my clients.","Kunkletown, PA","Vacationkids</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kunkletown, PA</strong>",47,5.0

There is a bit of a walk down to the shops and beachfront but you are saving a fair bit of money when compared to other hotels that are on the water. The rooms are small and fairly dated and the ocean view room is quite misleading. Our ocean view had a tiny sliver of water available....from the balcony....around the corner. So dont expect to wake up to views of the waves crashing onto Waikiki.The pool is very basic and there is a gym on site with some equipment available.

Ride on the trolleys for a quicker ride to points of interest. The Bus is cheaper $2.50 adults, $1.25 kids but is slower with frequent stops. If you're going sight seeing book a trip at the hotel lobby where they have Expedia local experts who will arrange everything for you. Pearl Harbor tour arranged thru them with the $55 Day Pass takes you to every site. They also arranged a tour of the North Shore and the island with Hawaii Turtle Tours. We had a blast with Eric our guide who showed us around. Plan for a whole day. Fumi's shrimp shack was delicious! Stop by the Old Sugar Mill and taste their Waialua coffee. Secret beaches and snorkeling.

Nice touch! The staff was friendly with the people in front of us for check in and with us too. At check in we were notify we got our room upgraded to Ocean View.

Complimentary wifi for your stay, access to computer and printer, activity and tour booking center, 2 mini store inside the hotel (no need to walk to the ABC Store), bar and deli open 24/7, clean pool, free warm breakfast and room very clean and modern. Breakfast includes, cereal, breakfast sandwich, French toast, oat meal, 4 kind of slice bread and a toaster, fruits, rice and other kind of food to cater to the oriental crowd, few type of juices, actual plates and utensil, other food I might have fail to mention too. Plenty of seating area in the pool for breakfast! If you like to eat in the room just bring your food tray that's in the room to take the food to your room. The room was quiet and beautiful. The bed were comfortable and AC was good. The bathroom was nice and the look on the sink is so slick! Balcony is small but with chairs and small tables. The flat screen was great and it had Direct TV and there was a lot of options to watch on tv if you need to. Complementary toothpaste! Mini fridge and nice ice bucket. There is complementary Wall Street Journal newspaper at your door. Phones on every elevator waiting area to call front desk. Ice machine is at every other floor if you need ice. Over all I will be looking forward staying here again. The hotel had no extra charges or hidden fees like other hotels (Aston Waikiki Hotel). Staff is amazing and friendly! Smells good everywhere and it's clean. It's a little gem in Waikiki! Can't wait to come back! Props to all staff & management for a great job! No complain...

We selected this hotel based off the positive reviews we read here on tripadvisor. The rooms are large, nicely appointed and very modern. The free breakfast is EXTREMELY helpful and really quite good, well above average. My only negatives are 1. The pigeons at the breakfast area need to be dealt with. As funny as it is to watch the newbies have their food pounced on the second they walk away ... It's annoying to have to be on ""watch"" your entire meal. 2. The pool area needs some love ... Some plants, decor, something ... It's just concrete. Yes the beach is only a block away, but sometimes it's nice to hang by a hotel pool.Overall I highly recommend staying at this hotel, we have previously stayed at the Prince, Hyatt and Sheraton in Waikiki and this hotel offers the best value overall.","Kelowna, BC","TravelingClan2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kelowna, BC</strong>",20,5.0

The hotel was located close to Waikiki beach, but a bit further away from the main hustle and bustle of the Waikiki strip. The hotel was new and modern, and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The complimentary buffet breakfast was one of the best features of the hotel. There was a large variety of hot and cold foods, as well as juices, and Starbucks affiliated coffee and tea. It was convenient for days we wanted to eat at the hotel, or pick up something and take off for the day. Only complaint was for about half the time we were staying there, every time we came back to our hotel after it had been cleaned there was a distinct odor that was not very pleasant. I believe it was the smell of a damp and dirty cloth that had been used to wipe and clean our room. As much as the room looked clean, the smell was very off putting, and we had to open our lanai door and spray as much body spray as we could to try to eliminate the smell. Please make sure house keeping uses clean and non-smelly cloths to clean the rooms.

All tolled we've logged in 65 visits to the Hyatt Regency Waikiki and just tried the Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach for the first time. The Hyatt Place is a winner in our book. Hospitality is a top priority as are the fantastic staff, great and spacious, newly renovated guest rooms and lovely appointed common areas. No name tags here as employees are encouraged to introduce themselves to guests and interact with them by name. Genuine smiles abound whether the employees think they are being watched or not. No glum faces here. Two books away from the beach, across the street from The Bus stop.Friendly, courteous and quick to respond to guest needs. Hawaiian music fills the air, beautiful tasteful Hawaiian decor, true Hawaiian hospitality at its finest...they way the Hyatt Regency Waikiki once used to be years ago when repeat guests were cherished. Good selection for included breakfasts and happy hour deals. Kudos to General Manager Bonnie Kiyabu who has put together a great crew of employees who exceed all expectations. Hyatt corporate would do well to realize that local Hawaiians are quite capable of managing their properties in Hawaii. A few more locals in the executive offices of Hyatt properties in Hawaii would be a welcome change and frankly is long overdue. Well done Ms. Kiyabu and everybody at he Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach.

Partial view since there is a huge building between the hotel and the beach but it was still nice to see water.The staff was excellent, very helpful and attentive.

Big TV, comfy bed, WiFi included, bar frig and breakfast daily all in the basic price. My only complaint was the size of the standard Mountain View Room that I had booked. By any measure it was on the small side of a standard hotel room (certainly the one they gave me was) and was not in any way the same as the photo's shown on their own web site. A quick talk to the girls at Reception and we were duly upgraded to a Deluxe room which looked more like the photo of the standard one - anyway, I was now happy.The location is at the southern end of the famous Waikiki strip and a leisurely 5-10 minute walk to numerous restaruants, bars etc.Breakfast can be a bit hectic at peak times and they continually run out of plates, cutlery etc but the staff do a good job topping it up as quick as they can. The Breakfast area is basically outdoors and can be a bit windy - I'm not sure where you go if it rains?I rented a car from the airport and my concern was where to park it. Valet parking was available at the hotel for $28 per night, but as I tend to come and go all the time I am loath to use it. Right cross the street is the Banyan Hotel and you can self park there - I paid $72 for 7 days with unlimited in and outs - a bargain! Where else can you park for basically $10 a day?

The hotel include a Kitchen Skillet which served complimentary breakfast on the pool deck every morning. After a week the menu started to repeat itself, but we did not mind because it was included in the price of the room and was very delicious.

Anything you can possibly need can be found in the ABC stores on every corner. I liked that the hotel was not directly on the beach because there were fewer guest hanging around the lobby and front of the hotel. Also very close to Diamond Head, Zoo, Aquarium, Shopping, and entertainment. We utilized the in house travel assistance to book activities. I think they worked for Expedia. We were able to book a trip for a luau, Pearl Harbor, and get maps of area restaurants and bars. The hotel also gave free wifi.

Plan on extra time for checking in as it took me 20 minutes. I stayed there for business and found it to be very beautiful, trendy and hip in overall decor. The rooms were comfortable/spacious with WI-FI and large desk/bright with sunlight. The in-room decor followed the ""island-modern"" theme of the public spaces and I loved that there was no yucky bedspread (always take them off as generally hotels infrequently wash them). Bed was extremely comfy. Housekeeping was scrupulous and there was a mini fridge. Complimentary breakfast is served on the roof-top terrace - very nice but crowded so plan accordingly. While the property is not beachfront - Waikiki beach is less than 5 minute walk. I was pleasantly surprised that the room was very quiet in spite of its location. You are minutes walking distance to Kapiolani Park (great place where locals jog, picnic and enjoy concerts/fairs and the zoo) and Kapahulu Avenue where locals shop/dine. As a woman traveling alone for business, I was not too happy about my car parked across the street in another parking garage. While there is valet service, I had to go in and out of the hotel frequently so self-parked for efficiency sake. There is ""competition"" for parking later at night - so that was a bummer.... not a fan of walking through areas that are not well lit.

Free fresh green apples are daily provided in lobby. Yes, on high wind days you can hear it howling through the hotel, once you know what's going on, no big deal.

Do not plan to stay too long in standard room, they closet space is limited and the dresser provides three drawers, period. No drawers in the night stands. No shelves or drawers near the sink.The lanai is worthless. It is occupied by two chairs facing each other, a table, and the AC compressor. We removed the table to sit in the chair, but couldn’t turn the chair to face away from the building. Twelve days and we never used it again.The pool is 30 feet long and maybe 20 feet wide. It is on the shady side of the building on the third floor. It seems the surrounding buildings create a wind tunnel and is always windy blowing hats, books, and towels into the pool. Total number in the pool was maybe ten during our entire stay.The pool area is also where you eat you free breakfast; outdoors hopefully under an available umbrella, sharing the space with the pigeons. Entertainment for breakfast is to watch the newbies place their food on the table and walk away maybe for a cup of coffee. The pigeons swarm down in mass and leave just the clean plate when the visitor returns. They provide a tray to bring food to you room for when it rains.The bar is on the side of an aisle use to access the two shops and the elevator. Nine stools and high table for a few more on the right side, this is not my favorite layout for drinks. We walked two blocks two beach and frequented very nice second floor bar with music overlooking Waikiki. The beds were very comfortable and the breakfast was good but it doesn’t change much. The exercise area has lots of treadmills and other aerobic machines, TV, and I pod hook ups. They even supply headphones. Good laundry 3 washers and dryers that take credit cards.The best part was the people who work there. Helpful, courteous, promises were kept and promptly executed.

We were on the 14th floor with partial ocean view...leaving the door open at night for fresh air proved noisy so wonder what being on the main road in another hotel would be? Only ""ordinary"" bit for us (20 and 50 mother/daughter) was the breakfast area. Located on the 3rd floor, beside a smallish but neat pool, it was incredibly windy and exposed (nice on a warm day). Think the hotel could add some wind breaks and definitely plants etc., there to make the ambience better. Staff super friendly and all-in-all very happy with the outcome (20 yo loved the free wi-fi for staying in touch with Australian friends). Thanks Hyatt Place!

Does not come with a tub but has a very large glass shower that is convenient to shower the kids after a day at the beach. There is an in-room safe to keep valuables. Very clean room and quiet. Our friends had an Ocean view room which have a full tub and separate room with t.v.Breakfast - Serves 2 stations of egg/ham muffin sandwich (type of bun and cheese change every day, waffle, pancake, french toast (changes every day - one of the 3), fruit salad only has pineapple and cantaloupe, pastries, yogurt, toast, miso soup, cereal, toast, bagels, apple, orange juice and milk, and other assorted breakfast items. It is located on the 3rd floor by the pool but is very windy. The best place to sit is undercover near the buffet or along the side wall of the building on the right. Beware the pigeons and birds are everywhere as they lurk around the tables or swoop down and each the food on the tables if left unattended.Location - It is only 1 block away from Waikiki beach, is very quiet, clean and staff are very friendly and helpful. About a 15 minute walk to International Marketplace. Safeway is only 10 minutes away, costs $2.50 for Bus #13 to get there. (keep the transfer so you can ride back to the hotel free). There is an ABC store every block to buy food or souvenirs but is expensive. Starbucks is just a block away as well. McDonalds is 3 blocks away along the beach. Very close to the zoo as well.Hotel arranges taxis 10 minutes before your departure to the airport for a flat fee of $29.00I would definitely recommend this hotel because of location, free hot breakfast, excellent beds and pillows, quiet, and 1 block from the beach and buses.","Vancouver, Canada","Glen K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",13,5.0

Check-in went very quickly and my room preferences were honored resulting in a nice high floor room with an ocean/beach view.One of the best things about this hotel, especially given the area, was its complementary breakfast each morning. The breakfast offering varied somewhat each day, with the hot offering typically being an egg sandwich of some type, usually on a English Muffin. The usual breakfast offerings of bagels, breads to make toast and cereals were also provided, along with juices and milk. Somewhat uniquely (perhaps not for Hawaii) they also offered rice and kimchi each morning. It was never difficult to find a seat, tables were bussed very quickly and in general it was a very pleasant experience.The room itself was perhaps a bit cramped, but the beds were comfortable with good climate controls, a flat screen HDTV with HD channels and a refrigerator for cooling your own beverages and snacks. The bathroom was lovely, but the shower was severely lacking in water delivery and pressure (do ""water saving"" shower heads actually save water when it takes you three times as long to shower because it takes five minutes just to rinse the shampoo out of your hair?)All in all, the hotel's location (two blocks from the beach, and one from one of Waikiki's ubiquitous ABC convenience stores, and about ten minutes' walk from the heart of the Kalakaua Avenue retail strip or the Honolulu Zoo), comfort and value make me confident that I'll return; why pay an extra $200 per night just to be on the beach?My one piece of advice is to avoid the hotel's rather pricy ($28/day with in/out privileges) valet parking and self-park at the Waikiki Banyan hotel garage located diagonally across the street to the north for only $12/day with full in-out privileges.",Colorado,"AscentGuy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colorado</strong>",31,5.0

All the staff are friendly, attentive, and helpful. The room was spotless and comfortable. I can see how some may get bored with the daily breakfast, but it still beats having to pay the big bucks for a breakfast somewhere else that probably wouldn't be as good. As for the noise factor--I am very sensitive to noise, and I know it's difficult to avoid noise if you want to stay in bustling Waikiki. At this property, the everyday city noise was noticeable but not disruptive. At night it would quiet down, and the streets next to the hotel are much quieter than the main streets going through Waikiki. TA reviewers have also been commenting on the ""wind tunnel"" effect that occurs throughout the halls of the hotel and then passes under the door to the room. It's a simple fix to lay a towel down along the door and you will not hear the wind at all. It was a great place to come back to after a long day at the beach.

Location to Waikiki Beach2. Free, hot breakfast3. Comfortable, clean roomsWe stayed at the Waikiki Hyatt Place from Jan. 12-16, 2013 and genuinely enjoyed our stay. The staff was wonderful - very friendly and helpful with directions and suggestions for places to eat. We arrived about an hour before check-in, and since our room wasn't ready, the staff upgraded us to a corner room with a view of the beach for free! The rooms are smaller than the standard mainland hotels, but they were perfectly cozy and comfortable nonetheless. The bed - my god, the bed - was incredibly comfortable. I sank right in and slept like a baby every night. Our lanai was the perfect place to enjoy our daily hot breakfast (a rotating selection of breakfast sandwiches, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit, french toast/waffles, cereal, miso soup, and coffee/tea) and watch the sun rise (and then set). Though, be warned: Waikiki is incredibly dense, and you'll be able to see into other hotel/apartment rooms (which means they can see you, too). If you see a naked old man like I did, it's your fault - I warned you. The pool is a bit on the small side (and not heated), but who cares when you're a 2-block, 5 min. walk to the beach? The bar does a nightly happy hour (Mai Tai's while we were there), but the prices were a bit confusing. The signs in the elevators advertise the drinks as $5.00, but the bartender charged us $5.50. There are TONS of other happy hour options within walking distance though, so check one of those out instead. We'd definitely stay here again and would recommend it to friends and family. Last word of advice: Waikiki Beach is massively busy. If you rent a car, be adventurous and drive up to Kailua Beach. Not only is it MUCH quieter, but it's far more scenic and the drive up is INCREDIBLE. Tons of beaches and scenic lookout points along the way.","Columbus, Ohio","mother_cow</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>",46,5.0

I would suggest bringing ear plugs and down loading a white notice app on your phone to play at night as all of Wikiki is noisy.

All too often I find reviews which vary so widely and are written such that it leads to believe the hotel staff wrote the review. I am member of the American Armed Forces with over 22 years active duty. I decided to visit Waikiki, Hawaii during my holiday leave period.Now onto my review. There is really only a few key things that make a hotel great. The first two are fairly straight forward and they are facility and location. The Hyatt Place Waikiki Hotel has both of those and then some. Only a short 2 - 4 minute walk to the waters edge of Waikiki beach location is about as good as it gets. The ocean view rooms have a near unobstructed view of the ocean. As for the facility, this is where I was very impressed. The rooms were modern and well stocked. Refrigerator, large 42"" LED HD television equipped with what appears to be a new version of LodgeNet. I have never seen or used LodgeNet before but I am sold on it. New movies and a large selection of SatTV stations including three ESPN channels, CNN, FOX and many more well known stations. This system made the evenings I decided to stay in very pleasant. The rest of the room was stocked with what one would expect... coffee maker, complementary water, coffee mugs, tea ect. The only shortfall, and it is a very MINOR one is that that is almost not worth mentioning... there is no microwave in the room. There was an instance where I wanted to reheat a sandwich I purchased from a local steak and cheese shop, ended up eating it cold (Matters not because it was still delicious) The lobby was very nicely furnished with plenty of seating, and a café which was open 24/7. All menu items were available at any time day or night. Not to mention the food was pretty darn good. Also in the hotel lobby was a small bar if anyone wanted a nightcap or even a cold beer during the day. The one and very minor shortfall here is that it was not a fully stocked bar. So only basic mixed drinks and domestic beers were available. I am not much of a drinker so definitely no negative points here from me, just letting anyone who reads this how things are. The pool was small(ish) and pretty basic but there is plenty of sunbathing space and lounging chairs. Near the pool area is where the complementary breakfast is served (continental breakfast is available in the hotel lobby) Omelets, breakfast biscuits (which were amazing!), cerials, coffee, fresh fruits and all the trimmings... excellent breakfast I must say.Lastly the staff. Here is where most hotels in my opinion fall short. The staff here take their job seriously. Their upbeat attitudes, big welcoming smiles and eager to provide the best service I've seen at any hotel. Everyone from the first moment I set foot on the property, has been top notch. I would go into details to explain how they have made my stay so fantastic but the list would just go on and on. The entire staff at this hotel starting at the graveyard shift reception desk, to the maids who do a fantastic job keeping the rooms in order and stocked, to the cooks and hotel manager. Every single staff member I encountered seemed genuinely happy to be working at this hotel and it showed in their service.I mentioned I am a 22 year United States Military service member. Good people working for any organization is never as simple as ""Finding"" good people. A great staff is a product of great leadership and a great environment fostered by the hotel leadership. Although I was not able to meet and congratulate the hotel management for doing such a fantastic job I only hope they are able to see this message and receive my gratitude. You've made a loyal customer out of me. Keep up the great work!","Yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa, Japan","Craig F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa, Japan</strong>",11,5.0

Breakfast is great - not just standard continental items, but also things like cheese and ham toasties. They have a small pool, but most guests are down at the beach (borrow a towel for free from reception desk), which is just a block away Ask for a room with ocean views. We were on level 11 and faced the ocean, which was nice (but would be better if two beachfront hotels weren't in the way!).Walk to shopping, restaurants. Drink at Tiki bar, which is on the corner closest to beach, and if you have time and energy, I recommend doing the mountain walk to Diamond Head mountain - an old volcano with walking trail. 3 mile walk from hotel, so a 2 hour round trip. Views are worthwhile, I promise. Wifi quality in hotel is excellent. They also allowed us to check in early (at 10am), which after a 10 hour flight, we were very grateful for! Hotel also has concierge desk, with friendly guys who can help plan your activities. It's cheaper to book them from Hawaii (as opposed to through your travel agent at home), so I recommend leaving it to the guys here.

In my 2nd floor room, this created an unreal and bizarre amount of noise, varying from a low loud moan to a high-pitched scream that completely drowned out music and the television, even set to a high volume. As a heavy sleeper that rarely has difficulty resting, I could barely sleep. What little sleep brought unpleasant dreams incorporating the noise. Finally, early in the morning, I inquired at the front desk and was THEN told to put a towel at the base of the door. This did indeed reduce the wind vacuuming into the room, cutting out about 90% of the noise. Sadly, this came too late to be any help for me when I left exhausted for 2 days of flights. This seemed to be a common complaint (based on how the front desk responded to me) so why hasn't the hotel put in some kind of door seal or at the least advise guests beforehand?Otherwise, the hotel was decent, clean, with nicely appointed rooms, typical comfortable Hyatt beds, and polite staff.","Portland, Oregon","JUngmo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",2,2.0

Spending 2 weeks in Oahu, thought we'd experience 3 different hotels. After much research, we decided to give Hyatt Place a go. It was a really good decision.We were in the Diamond Towers, which has ocean views, 12th flr, with 2 queen beds. As we have a 16yr old daughter, the 2 queen beds were a neccesity for us, so everyone can relax on the bed after a long day tour.The bedroom is partitioned by a huge LCD TV/cabinet and you can turn the TV the other way round facing the other side, which is the lounge area. Lounge has a 3-seater sofa and single seater, with a computer table. Lots of storage space/cabinets. Free coffee/tea, however, mineral water is $3 per bottle. The shower space is adequate for a single person, however, the water flow is quite slow. Towels were really clean and sparkling white, which is very important for me, as I gauge the star of the hotel by the standard of the towels, and being a seasoned traveller all over the world, this is normally quite accurate.The other preference is perhaps they should separate the toilet from the shower, as the other family member cant use the toilet if someone else is showering.The sink space could be larger as well. Only valet parking available, $25per day. The pizza from room service, esp. Vegetarian & BBQ Chicken is the Best we have ever tasted! Must try! As my teenager was too tired, she fell asleep as soon as we checked in, after a long flight, and upon waking after 8hrs later, the BBQ Chicken was still delicious, without the need to warm it.Every staff in the Hotel very friendly, breakfast and free wifi also included! What else do you want in a regular hotel! Definitely worth what we paid for.","Melbourne, Australia","bearsticky</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",167,4.0

This hotel had just completed renovation in April so we were able to secure a very attractive rate for our room. We were very impressed with the staff and renovations throughout the hotel and our room. The room, although small was warm and inviting (you'll go home wishing your bedroom had a bed as comfortable The Hyatt Place.) The view wasn't great but we didn't pay for that so no love lost there. The free full breakfast was great... and did I say free? That's worth at least 20 dollars a day for two people in Oahu, can't beat that. However, the location of the breakfast area on the 3rd floor left a little to be desired. It was always very windy and therefore usually a mess during breakfast with juice and food scattered throughout which the wind blew while people were eating. Not unbearable. The location was good, very close to the Waikiki Beach, Kapiolani Park and Waikiki Zoo. There is also a public parking garage right on the corner opposite of the hotel where you can park for 10 dollars a day. 60 per week. This was awesome considering that parking is generally 20+ dollars a day in most parts of Waikiki. Overall, this hotel is a great value in a good location with convenient access to cheap parking. You'll be more than satisfied with your stay if you don't expect 5 star accommodations for 3.5 star pricing. We will happily stay at The Hyatt Place during our next trip to Waikiki.

Valet at hotel was 25 a day so I only used it for my last day to avoid lugging (no pun intended) my luggage to the car.I only had two negatives to bring up and both are mostly minor. First, the hotel elevators are insaneeeeeely slow. Spent a good amount of time waiting for an elevator. I was on the 10th but it might as well been 100th for the time I spent waiting. Secondly and a little more to be concerned about is the shower sliding glasses. My first day there I almost broke my fingers due to the way the handles operate. I mentioned it to the staff but thought you should be aware of it.Overall though, great place to stay if you're in the wakiki area.

Great service, free WiFi, and a complimentary breakfast were just three of the highlights from our three-night stay. The hotel is located just two blocks from the beach, and our room was huge. Some reviewers have complained about the breakfast area because it's outside and the food attracts birds, which is true. However, it wasn't a major problem and we were able to enjoy our breakfast. There was also plenty of room to eat during our stay, although I can imagine that space could be an issue during busy periods.If you decide to self-park, you'll pay $12/day at a lot that's not associated with the hotel and located across the street. We did this the first two days and it worked fine. On the third day, the lot was full and we ended up using the hotel's valet service, which is $25/day. Ideally, the hotel would have it's own lot for self-parking, but it wasn't a big deal. When you're just two blocks from the beach, it's hard to complain about paying $25 to park.Overall, we were surprised the Hyatt Place wasn't ranked even higher in TripAdvisor's list of Waikiki hotels. The room rate can be a little high, but it's certainly competitive with other hotels in the area. We didn't experience a single problem mentioned in some of the reviews, and we would definitely stay there again.","Fresno, CA","56waldorf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fresno, CA</strong>",74,5.0

They have done everything in their power to help me out and not only have the come up with the goods but their politeness and kindness has been a credit to both them and their organisation. In particular I would like to thank Stephen and his staff.I made a reservation through bookit.com about a month ago for the Hyatt Place Waikiki. Bookit.com took a deposit and the remainder was to be paid over 2 payments. Yesterday I got a call from my bank to say that the Australian Federal Police had contacted the bank to say that my credit card was among a number that had been skimmed (details of my credit card had been fraudulently obtained - no details given of where or when) and that they needed to cancel the card and reissue a new one with a new number.Over the last month I have tried numerous times to contact Bookit to give them a different credit card number and they never contacted me back. I had all but given up. However, with yesterday’s events, I didn’t have any choice – I have to change the credit card number but Bookit won’t accept that unless I either gave them my other credit card number over the phone (like I am going to do that given recent events!) or I cancelled the booking and rebooked at the current rate which is now $300 more expensive and there is was special discount that we got when we originally booked, meaning it will cost me another $4-500. The Hyatt's staff have been wonderful and have rebooked me directly with the hotel at a slightly lower rate than Bookit gave me. Nothing was too much trouble for them and they were unbelievably good to work with. They really understand customer service and if this experience is any indication of the service we’ll be getting in Hawaii, I can’t wait to go!On the downside,Bookit tried to tell me that they couldn't let me pay the rest by paypal because the Hyatt didn't take paypal. However, the Hyatt confirmed with me that bookit paid them directly with bookit's own credit card, so whether the Hyatt takes Payal or not is irrelevant. I pay bookit and bookit pays the Hyatt. Bookit clearly says they take paypal, so why can't I pay them by paypal? Yet another reason to never use bookit again.","Sydney, Australia","Angela D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",6,5.0

The room is very spacious, clean and new. I had a balcony with morning sun. For an American hotel, it is great value for money! You can take the breakfast to your room, no problem. There is a fridge in the room to store your drinks. What could be improved, is the noise isolation of the room. Single glass windows do not keep the noise of the heavy Honolulu traffic out of the room. They dealt very well with an issue regarding my room (I discovered a bed bug on my first evening).

Overall, i thought this hotel was OK. The furniture and everything around the hotel appears to be fairly new (one of the staff persons said it just became the Hyatt Place in Dec 2011?). Bed was comfortable and pillows were to my liking - not too soft. This is my 2nd visit to Waikiki so the hubs and i didn't do a ton of touristy stuff. There is a bus stop right at the corner, so it was easy to get around town with our 4 day bus pass (Diamond Head and Hanuma Bay was super easy to get to). The beach was 2 blocks away and the main shopping area was at most a 10 minute walk. We were first placed in a mountain view room on the 8th floor which had a separate sitting area (2 loveseats), i had unpacked all of our toiletries etc. and found some ""issues"" with the bedding so i called to ask for someone to bring up new sheets. They offered to send someone to replace the sheets or just move us to a new room. It was already late at night and after 12 hours of traveling i didn't want to deal with someone in the room so i opted for another room, which he told me was a little smaller (because apparently the room i got was one of the bigger ones) but on a higher floor (i was initially on the 8th fl). So the hubs got the new key card and we got the highest floor facing the ""mountain"" on the 14th floor - the room was SO SO much smaller. It was missing the entire seating area. It wasn't a big deal but for those that are looking for space, make sure you ask about this at check-in or when you do any switching of rooms. Anyway, again, it was late and for us this was just a place to sleep. We were on a higher floor, less bus/street noise (and we are from NYC so generally street noise does not bother us). The balcony was really small - all the other lanais that we've experience in Hawaii are probably 2x that size at least. But there was not much to look at, and we didn't spend much time out on the balcony. The free breakfast was OK, nothing to rave about, edible but certainly wouldn't pay extra for it - the coffee was probably the best thing that was available. Happy hour (it was only one type of drink that is specially priced) was ok, again nothing to rave about other than it being fairly inexpensive for an alcoholic drink. The sink (in both rooms) were outside the toilet and shower area - and in there was only a shower stall, no tub. For the price we paid, we thought it was acceptable for the Waikiki area. I don't think i would return though - other than the new furniture, close to public transportation, and, for the most part, clean appearance of the hotel, there is not much else going for it.",new york,"jyp0827</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>new york</strong>",19,3.0

The price brought the trip down into our range and we booked it. We certainly didn't regret that choice. We were debating between an ocean view and a city view room so I called the hotel directly to find out just how much of an ""ocean view"" those rooms had. The gentleman at the front desk was incredibly helpful and answered all my questions. He recommended asking for a high floor if we were opting for ocean view, so we did. When we arrived, they put us in room 1417 and it was amazing. We had a great view from our balcony. The breakfast every morning was perfect for us. Different breakfast sandwiches daily, cereals, toast, granola, pastries, juice and coffee. The staff were always happy to make us a ""custom"" version of the day's breakfast sandwich if we didn't like what they had on offer. The room had a breakfast tray in it so we could go down, get our food, and enjoy our breakfast up on our balcony watching the sunrise. It became a morning ritual that I miss now that we're home again! The room was clean and just a nice size for the two of us. Everything we wanted was within walking distance or a short trolley ride. We weren't smack in the middle of all the ""action"" (and noise and crowds) but could get to it easily when we chose to. The beach at the end of the road (one block away) was nowhere near as crowded as Waikiki Beach even though they're essentially the same place! We would definitely go back to this hotel on a return trip to Waikiki. The only hiccup we had was our luggage. Due to flight issues, our luggage arrived over 24 hrs after we did. We'd been told by the front desk that if it arrived after 10pm, they'd hold it down there for us for the morning (perfect!). Unfortunately, a well intentioned staff member called our room after 1am when the luggage arrived to inform us it was there and see if we needed it that night. It was unexpected and startled us awake.

Unfortunately there isn't much hope. With the selection of hotels in waikiki at this price point, it would be best to pass on the hyatt place. Not really a kid favorite and boring for adults too. The pool is so uninviting and within the wind tunnel that even the kids pass on it. We ended up just walking accross the street to use their nieghbor's pool, and no spa/jacuzzi?

The one hiccup was right when I checked in. I had booked 6 nights directly on the Hyatt website in an ocean view room. When I arrived, I was informed my reservation was for 1 night in a city view room. Upon producing my confirmation which I printed out prior to leaving home, Allyson took care of the situation calmly and professionally, ensuring I was in a room that was satisfactory to me. I cringe to think what would have happened if the hotel was full.

I am SO pleased to report that everything else about my stay was wonderful!! The room was comfortable with pleasing decor, the location fantastic, and every staff member I encountered was friendly and quick to say Aloha. Breakfast was very nice, and after reading other reviews, I expected to make many trips back to my room with my food due to crowding or birds. This was never the case. Also, the towels available for the beach were much appreciated. Happy Hour from 5-7pm was a huge hit with everyone (a great deal too!) and I found it a great way to meet folks as I was traveling solo. A group of us even headed to dinner after meeting the same night at Happy Hour! My hats off to bartender Nick, who was not only humorous and engaging, but really took ownership of the bar to create a wonderful atmosphere for all the guests. He offered good, solid recommendations for food/activities and was always interested to find out about your day and your evening's plans. He definitely is an asset to the Hyatt Place.

Here is my take on the place.First, I emailed the hotel ahead of time to request a room with a bathtub as we have a 10 month old and she obviously requires baths, especially after a day at the sandy beach, I was informed by the person who replied that only deluxe rooms with 2 queen beds have bath tubs and we would have to upgrade to acquire one of these rooms. We decided to not go ahead with the upgrade as we already had an ocean view room, and I didn't wish to pay anymore. I instead booked an infant tub with an outside company from which I also rented a full size baby crib. When we got to the hotel on our arrival everyone was very nice and pleasant, I asked the agent (I THINK his name was Terrance?) if it was possible to get upgraded to a room with a tub, since we had an Ocean View Standard room, they upgraded us to a City View Deluxe room at no charge, so I figured it was a fair trade and shooed away any disappointment in loosing my ocean view. It was dark when we arrived so I couldn't really see the view in our room, but we were in the Pali Tower on the 11th floor, and the next morning when I went outside onto our balcony I was pleasantly surprised that while I didn't have a full unobstructed view of the Ocean, I could see it from our balcony. It was also VERY noisy from the street, luckily we were all so exhausted by the end of the night it didn't see to affect us much, however when there were sirens or loud motorbikes going by it sometimes woke up our baby whose crib was placed by the balcony door. The room was a fair size, the beds and pillows were comfortable and the sitting area with pull out couch and ottoman was nice as well. The television was on a swivel wall mount so we could watch it in bed or sit on the couch and watch TV, and my husband also liked that you could download an app on our ipad to control the TV from which was nice to figure out which channels were which and preview movies. The breakfast was nice, and FREE so Im not going to make a complaint about that because everything in Waikiki was so expensive this was a major money saver for us and we ate breakfast there every day. We got housekeeping every second day (by choice), the lady we had on our floor seemed to be the same one everyday and we really liked her she was super friendly! I will however say that I had to ASK for our tub to be cleaned after 3 services because it had not even been wiped down for our entire stay, and when I did ask her to clean it, I didn't feel it was done the greatest. When we arrived I wasn't all to impressed with the cleanliness appearance of it in the first place, and it had a tad bit of a mildew smell to it when you got into shower. The tile portion of the room which was in the doorway and throughout the sink and bathroom area also was obviously vacuumed but I doubt its seen a mop in months and I would not let my daughter crawl there. We had to request that our bedding be changed as it smelled of urine (no we did not pee the bed :)), and they did change it promptly, and when I called about our sink on the second day as it was not draining, someone came up immediately to fix it....unfortunately I saw what was clogging it, ugh. After that it worked perfectly the rest of our stay. The walk to the beach was super quick, I cant complain about location. We saw the same staff almost everyday for our entire stay, they were all super nice I wonder if they ever take time off??It was a bummer there is no restaurant on site, and we did try room service, wouldn't recommend it. Parking for our rental for one night was 25.00 and local calls from the room were $1.00 a piece. Overall, this hotel was nicely decorated, the staff were excellent, the rooms were modern and for the MOST part they were clean, If I was looking for a good rate on a decent hotel, I would choose the Hyatt Place again, but I think next time we will spring for a Condo.","Lloydminster, Alberta","leslieannef</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lloydminster, Alberta</strong>",1,3.0

The hotel and room was clean and comfortable generally but the breakfast is hyped up somewhat. It's okay but repetitive and as its buffet style, it's almost impossible to get hot food. It doesn't help that from 7.30 it's difficult to get a seat indoors (which is very limited to begin with) and that means you have to eat by the pool.That means the you have to sit and do battle with the birds who are well practiced at sneaking onto your food while you are distracted or fetching a refill - very amusing when you see it happen to someone else but less so when it happens to you! Some people are clearly scared by the birds so they have to resort to taking breakfast back to their room.The pool/breakfast area is mostly outside on the 3rd floor so it can be very windy and at this time of year, the hotel tower is in the way of the sun so it's not that warm. The pool itself is tiny, with extremely limited supply of sun beds so those factors together wit the wind don't make it an attractive option!A good hotel let down by the above (they ought to use the space in the lobby for breakfast too) and not worth the premium prices being charged.","Stone, United Kingdom","leomJ4872SY</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stone, United Kingdom</strong>",53,3.0

Paid a few bucks to upgrade, completely worth the more spacious room (King View with separate living area, views of Diamond Head and the ocean). Very clean, renovated/modern furnishings, breakfast was free, staff is friendly, everything was comfortable and easy. TV was a good size, free HBO. I was there with my hubby and 7 mo baby, so my opinion is based on family friendliness. The closest beach (two blocks) is great for families with little ones because it is less crowded and there’s a surf breaker, so the water is very calm, shallow, and warm. The adjacent beach, San Souci, is also fantastic and less touristy. The hotel provided us with a “crib” (which was really a generic brand pack n play) that was less than stellar – the mattress didn’t fit properly (about 3 inches too short!) and was lumpy. I stuffed the extra blanket under the crib sheet and used it for the baby to play in but didn’t let her sleep in it. However, I saw newer looking Graco pack n plays in the hallway, so maybe we got stuck with the last junky one. There is also a mini fridge in the room which was extremely helpful for storing milk for pumping mamas. My only complaints were the lack of a bathtub and the loud AC. Without a tub, I had to bathe my baby in the sink or in the standing shower. Not the end of the world but a tub would’ve been a lot easier. It could be a challenge for small children because the shower head is pretty high, or maybe there are rooms with tubs that I’m unaware of. Like other reviewers noted, the AC is loud and next to the bed. Slightly annoying, but would not deter me from staying here again. The pool is small and uninviting. We prefer the beach so it wasn’t an issue, but if you are looking for good pool/lounging time I would go elsewhere. Overall we were very happy with our stay and would definitely come back!","San Diego, California","breezysteph</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",1,4.0

It's a clear step (or two) down from the area's well known standards (i.e. - the Haleukulani or Moana Surfrider) and located a bit far from the main action. It's within a few minutes of the beach and seems to target a college-age crowd. Guests staying here should not expect expect much more than a clean, quiet place to sleep.First, the good things: the hotel is new, clean, reasonably well located, very reasonably priced and the staff is courteous and very friendly. Guests will find very little to fault in these areas. The location is a bit far from the main part of the tourist strip but that also means it's a bit more quiet (and it's still only a few minutes on foot to everything else).If you're the kind of person who just wants a decent place to sleep - stop reading here because you'll be perfectly happy with this place. However, if you're someone who appreciates things a bit more on the high-end side and looks for attention to detail and luxury - there a few things you should be aware of:Although the lobby has a nice, open-air feeling to it - the standard rooms are tiny and lacking any kind of ambiance or detail at all. The bathrooms (which lack a separate toilet area) are equally cramped and there's little more that can be said about them other than they are brown.The staff is extremely friendly and helpful but seem to be limited in number especially in the evening and the concierge desk is sporadically manned it seems.The complimentary breakfast is a joke - some fruits and yogurt, the worst danish I've ever had and the only ""main"" was a greasy, egg-bacon-cheese sandwich. It was free (which is good since nobody would pay for this) but seating was limited and guests are semi-encouraged to take-away and eat in their rooms.Overall, this hotel does not have the desire or try to be the next luxury hotel in Waikiki. The atmosphere is somewhat akin to a youth hostel and that feeling is complimented by the fact that the average guest appears to be around college age (likely because this is also one of the cheaper properties in the area). This is in no way a bad thing necessarily but prospective guests who prefer the attention to detail found at finer hotels should look elsewhere.",Tokyo,"bmm727</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo</strong>",29,3.0

Everyday, you could only pick your fruit existing of pineapple and melon. Not enough variety!French toast and Belgian waffels didn't look remotely as the real French toast and waffels in Europe.Housekeeping only provided bars of soap and not any kind of shower gel or body lotion. That was strange!! I enquired about that. The lady who cleaned the room said that I had to ask about that at the front desk.There was also a tea facility in the room but when I asked the front desk about herbal tea instead of the breakfast tea which was present in the room they said the 'green' tea needed to be purchased and was not free. That really surprised me.A tip: Do no use the bottled water in the room. The hotel will charge you 3,50 dollars per bottle. That's way overpriced!!

Well, there's another tall building blocking part of Diamond Head, but we were at least on an upper floor and could enjoy a scenic view. The four computers downstairs are often occupied, so print your boarding passes if you see an empty computer. Some computers freeze, so restart them. The computer requires one start and end a session, so it cleans out the cache and history. The room was spacious, but the bathroom was very cozy. Since it's completely renovated, it was very clean, however we did find an open safety pin stuck into the carpet. Staff were friendly. Parked the car at the Aston Waikiki at the Banyan diagonally across the street from the Hyatt Place because they offer weekly parking with in and out privileges for $72 for 7 days or $12 per day. The Aston is actually both long-term permanent residents and a lot of vacation rental apartments, and the parking garage is open to anyone, not just those staying at the Aston. The Hyatt charges $25 per day plus remember the tip each time, and not to mention the long waits when a lot of people are waiting, so self-parking was a lot better this way. However, the garage is a little tight in some places, but all garages in Honolulu are likes this. Overall, the free breakfast was decent, but food ran out often. The outdoor breakfast area is windy and full of birds, so use the tray in your room! Bring the tray down and stock up on the food, then head to your room or, as we did, headed down one floor in the elevator and sat at the many tables in the lobby adjacent to the hotel bar/cafe and near the computer/biz center. It was always sparsely populated and we could enjoy breakfast without wind and birds (that freely pecked at unattended food), also one time someone's sunglasses fell from high up the hotel tower (prob. from the balcony's patio table) and down to the breakfast area.

Compared to the neighboring Marriott with 1175 rooms and the 1239 room Hyatt Regency down the street, Hyatt place is a quiet sanctuary from the bustle of Waikiki. The hotel is a recent purchase by Hyatt, and was remodeled and updated. Hyatt retained many of the former staff, meaning the staff is helpful, professional and happy to be working under the Hyatt brand.The standard model for the larger hotels on Waikiki is to have shops on the first floors and common areas. The interiors of the Marriott and Hyatt Regency look more like shopping malls than hotels. While the Hyatt Place does not have restaurants, they are within easy walking distance. Instead of shops, the Hyatt Place has a modern contemporary common area with a 24-hour bar.Hyatt Place has two different towers. The Pali Tower is considered the deluxe tower due to the size of the rooms at 500 to 550 sq feet. The Diamond tower has standard room accommodations room size 220 to 250 sq ft. The penthouse floor is identical to all the other rooms in the Pali Tower, only difference is that the PH floor is the top floor. Insiders Tip: On your next visit, you can request to be on a higher floor. If you prefer ocean views, on the website you will need to confirm Deluxe King or Queen Ocean View, and request the penthouse floor. If you want to save money, get the smaller standard room; if you want more space, get a deluxe room. Our room had a sitting area and more plugs than I have ever seen in a hotel room. A skillet breakfast is included with the room. Fried egg is combined daily rotation of breads for an open-faced egg sandwich. Yogurts, fruit, granolas, cereal, miso soup and bagels with cream cheese are additional choices. Breakfast is from 6:30 to 9:30.The lobby area has a 24-hour bar and snack bar. In the back corner of the area is a gift shop with remarkably competitive prices. The water and juices there were less the neighboring ABC store! Would you rather pay $3.25 for a bottle of water in the room or $.85 in the gift shop?Insiders Tip: Park at the Aston Banyan diagonally across the street. You get in and out privileges and it is half the price of valet parking at the Hyatt Place. We had a deluxe city view room, which actually faced Diamond Head and had a partial ocean view. Our room had a small lanai (balcony), which we enjoyed in our down time. We were on Oahu for just a few days so we did not intend Hyatt Place to be a place of relaxation. If you want relaxation, head to Maui or Kauai.

Switch and bait!! This hotel has two towers. The rooms in the newer tower are small! Previous to this visit I had stayed 3 times in the first tower which was renovated two years ago. Upon arrival today, I was literally put in the smallest room in the hotel (they told me it was) which is in the most recently renovated tower. It was so small it is the only room in the hotel without a desk. I thought it was odd that they would put a single person staying 7 nights in a room with no desk. Meaning it would seem obvious to me that I was there on business. So they moved me to another small room but at least I have a desk. Oh, did I mention the air conditioner didn't work.

I found a great airfare to Honolulu and decided to spend a couple of days in Waikiki working remotely. I am a top tier member of the Marriott brand and mid tier member of Hilton and Hyatt brands. These brands are represented all over Waikiki but after comparing different hotels across the brands I chose the Hyatt Place because of the value I would get from my points. My two main needs were reliable free wifi and free calls to toll-free numbers for conference calls. I got both with Hyatt Place.As many others have mentioned, the hotel is a newer property with a bountiful continental breakfast. I used my points for a deluxe city room and received a room on the 18th floor with a partial view of Diamond Head. Plus I could see the sun rise every morning! I liked that a whole lot better than the partial ""ocean view"" I saw in some of the reviews here. Check-in was great because the person who checked me in offered to give me a tour of the first floor before I went up to my room. I don't think I've ever gotten that at any hotel I've been in! The room was pretty spacious with one of the biggest TVs I've seen in a hotel room. There were plenty of outlets which I really appreciated. It allowed me to work anywhere in the room. And the shower was great - there was always hot water with great water pressure. The only negative is that the balcony doors are not soundproofed at all. I could hear the traffic all day and night from the 18th floor. Even though the Hyatt Place is at the end of the strip, I could still hear trucks backing up in the middle of the night. Thankfully I'm not a light sleeper so I could sleep through it.Another desire I had was to save as much money as possible on the trip. The free breakfast helped a lot. I thought it had really good variety for a continental breakfast. Even with my statuses at the other brands, due to certain rules, I would not have gotten free breakfast at other hotels. Plus I saved myself from having to pay resort fees at the other hotels. I also saved money by taking the bus rather than renting a car or taking a taxi. The hotel is at the corner of a bus stop that serves many routes which is very convenient.","Bridgewater, New Jersey","yunicorner</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bridgewater, New Jersey</strong>",24,5.0

You're 1 block from the beach, rooms are clean and up to date, service is great and so awesome that you get a hot breakfast every morning. We paid extra for the ocean view room but after a few days we noticed that our bed was not really comfortable so we called to the gallery host and spoke to Thomas the manager. He was more than happy to switch us to another room which was not ocean view but mountain view/city view. Didn't matter cause the room had a better bed and it was sooo much bigger. Oh and we had a tub now and we had a whole wall with windows and a huge balcony! The tub was relaxing since I'm pregnant and all. The free breakfast was great! French toast, pancakes, egg and ham sandwiches, yogurt, hot oatmeal, bagels and toasts, fruits, starbucks coffee and orange juice, etc.... really saved us a lot of money. After the 6th day though we were kinda over it but hey we saved money for 6 days of breakfast! Overall, so happy that we went with Hyatt Place.

We loved the two small balconies and our ocean view (we had only paid for a city view so this was luck).The breakfast was excellent too - so much variety! For me (a strict vegetarian), I had the fresh fruit (pineapple, canteloupe, and honeydew melon), and the oatmeal with sunflower seeds and nuts. My friend usually went for the egg/meat/biscuit offering as well as the danishes. There was yoghurt, toast, 4-5 different juices, coffee and Tazo teas as well. Staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful - everything from providing beach towels to calling a taxi for the airport (they have a special $29 rate), to storing bags after check out, to answering questions at the breakfast buffet.Bus stop was also right outside the hotel which was convenient for day trips.The only thing we were missing in the room was an additional mirror so that we could both get ready at the same time.

The hotel is located about a block and a half from the beach. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very friendly front desk staff. Although we arrived a few hours before the actual check in time, we were allowed access to our rooms right away. We had originally been booked on one of the lower floors, but in reading the Trip Advisor recommendations by folks who had previously stayed there, I asked for a higher floor, which I learned has larger rooms with better views and which constitutes an upgrade. We were given the upgrades without a hitch. Our rooms were located on the 11th floor. The rooms were very spacious with two queen beds and a sitting area with a couch and a coffee table. The bathroom had a separate lavatory area with a separate shower and toilet. The room had a huge flat screen TV with lots of free movie channels. The room also had a lanai with two chairs. We had a partial view of Diamond Head and the beach. The room itself was modern and tastefully decorated, with wonderful, comfortable mattresses. The hotel has a small exercise room and an even smaller pool, but who needs these two things when the beach and other activities are steps away.The hotel provided a breakfast, which was great. Every morning there was a different breakfast sandwich, a variety of breakfast cereals, and either pancakes, waffles or french toast. There was fresh fruit which consisted of fresh pineapple and melon. Cottage cheese and yogurt were also available, as well as hot steel cut oatmeal with a large variety of toppings, including a selection of nuts, dried fruit and other toppings such as granola. There was even a section for the Japanese guests, with miso soup, steamed rice and various toppings for the rice. The beverages included a juice station included orange, pineapple, grapefuit, tomato and a V-8 type juice. Coffee and tea were also served. As you can tell, I was impressed. This was quite a savings for us, as restaurants on Oahu can be very expensive. The one negative thing about the location of the eating venue was that it is quite windy. We solved this by taking the trays provided in each of the rooms and taking our breakfast down to the ground floor where tables and chairs are also located. A coffee and tea bar are thoughtfully placed there as well. (A flyer left in our rooms had suggested this option.)There was some street noise (sidewalk repair was taking place), but it all settled down by the time we ready for bed.In all, our stay was very pleasant, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.","La Verne, California","Pat C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Verne, California</strong>",15,4.0

There is a cheaper public parking option right across the street but it is not 100% convenient if you are travelling with kids. (3) THE ROOM. The room was clean but INCREDIBLY SMALL. Just enough space for a bed and TV. The tiny patio is practically useless due to its size. Wasn't an issue for us since we only needed a place to sleep. Also, I paid for an ""Ocean View King"" room. However what I was able to see from the window (9th store) couldn't be classified even as a partial ocean view (completely behind other buildings). Moving to 14th floor (the highest available in one of the two towers) didn't help much. Long story short, don't expect any good ocean view from this property. Based on this property location (not water front), paying extra for view does not make any sense. (4) BREAKFAST. Complimentary breakfast was OK and really nice to have. Not too many hot items (very average sandwiches don't count). Watch out for birds (pigeons are always ready to help you with your breakfast). (5) FACILITIES. Gift shop downstairs was nice: local beer, cloths. Also, there is a printer available (no additional charge), convenient to print boarding passes for example.Bottom line: decent place to stay if you really want to be close to Waikiki, the land of highrise hotels and tourist buses.","Las Vegas, Nevada","dmmmem</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",17,3.0

Pity that this hotel has no ""real"" restaurant, but there are excellent ones every where else in all major hotels. The Front Desk staff are all genuinely friendly, flexible and helpful if you get their attention to look up, as they're lost staring down at their computers.(Hyatt should place the monitors higher up as in most hotels).The Travel desk is always busy very too slow, there's always a line with an unfriendly clerk full of self importance, ""talking down"" on to Guests. Better use the friendly Travel desks of other main hotels like the Westin Moana Surfrider, you are not getting it for free, why put up with it?Great that Internet is free and 21st century has finally arrived to America, so to speak.So is an innovative sort of comp. basic B'fast Buffet with the essentials. I enjoyed this convenient new self-rooms service-concept too. Only problem is that it gets rather monotonous eating the same things every day if you're there for a long stay, always the eternal hot omelet sandwiches (Hey Hyatt: Make an effort, use your notorious ""F&B imagination"" a bit more and vary the fruit choices too as there are other fruits is Hawaii except Pineapples & Melons)The open sided Lobby is not where you want to hang around at all, too open and too ""train stationish"" with no welcoming atmosphere and high humidity, only good for waiting to get a room and leave immediately. The ""lonely"" bar's a boring place as if Hyatt didn't know what to do with that space in the corridor. Better to sit in the Lobby at the Marriott across the street with lots of comp. daily papers and very comfortable seats, or at the great Westin nearby with good F&B outlets.The beach right in front of this hotel has the ""Wrong Crowd"" and it's too neglected with a mix of dirty white sand & cigarette buts...( I see that no one of the desk staff has ever used that beach, in order not to recommend it...) Not as good as the lovely beaches near the Westin, with well maintained immaculate ""yellow sands"" and people who look more like real Hyatt Place guests!...Same poor note for the beach in front of Hyatt Regency; really down market.....Unless you are Japanese or speak it well, don't stay at the Hyatt Regency! In it's early days in the 70-80' it was a great hotel, now it shows it's age and feels like a little Tokyo ghetto....Not a healthy mix of Nationalities, I am glad they were full so I came to stay at the Hyatt Place which is new and less expensive. In a ""Coconut shell"": My advice is to stay here to sleep, use the Marriott or Westin Lobby Lounges and go to the Beach at the Westin / Royal vicinity.","Honolulu, Hawaii","GRN-GVA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",107,4.0

However, the breakfast service and a good couple of stars below the standard of the rest of the premises. The eating area is entirely outside adjacent to the swimming pool, and has no roof whatsoever. The result being that, on a day such as today (9th Sept 2012), when the area is suffering from a stiff breeze, food goes flying everywhere, which the local birds then swoop down to steal - hygiene not being a consideration. I personally made 3 trips to the bread toasting machine before I managed to get food back to my table which was not blown away. According to staff, during the ""windy"" season, food is served downstairs in the lobby (itself open to the elements at one end) however, it's ""not windy enough"" at present I am told.The breakfast itself is of a poor selection compared to other USA hotels I have stayed at in the pasted - the only hot item offered each day being a muffin with a scrambled egg patty and a piece of ham in it - no choice, no variation so far in the three days we've been down. Also offered is a rotation of tepid pancakes or waffles,a selection of low grade cereal, and bread for toasting (as long as you can stop it blowing away). No butter is offered, only a vegan oil spread which makes the toast wet, and the same monotonous, sour pineapple and melon combo is rolled out each morning. I don't know if I will be entertaining this food for the rest of my stay, I might just go and buy breakfast elsewhere.

Initially worried about the location on the map it seems farther away from everything, but for us it was awesome close to a nice quite beach, just on the edge of hectic Waikiki, close to Kapiolani park and we walked to Diamond Head and right on all necessary bus routes. Hotel is very quite, clean, nicely decorated/furnished and the king size bed was super comfy. We had an ocean facing view and we were on the 4th floor and could just see a little bit of the Ocean. Front desk staff suggested checking with us to see if later there would be a room on a higher floor, we did check one time, but really there was not much wrong with the 4th floor, so decided to just stay there.I think they do a great job with customer service, everyone is super friendly and the fact that breakfast and in room wifi are included and printing (for those google maps) is free too.Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again.","Canmore, Alberta, Canada","Moira G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canmore, Alberta, Canada</strong>",19,4.0

It is about two blocks from the beach in a central location. As others have posted, the free breakfast has lots of choices-more than what appears on the hotel website--with two kinds of egg sandwiches, one of which is open faced on a bagel thin, waffles or french toast, yogurt, fruit, oatmeal. There were also breakfast choices for Japanese guests. As a Hyatt diamond we were upgraded to a king ocean view--this meant we were on a high floor and could see the ocean through openings in the buildings in front of the hotel. Our room was small--it was not a problem for us as we had only carry-on luggage but if you are staying a longer time you may want to get confirmation of room size. There is a refrigerator in the room and a huge flatscreen tv--46 inches. The bed was very comfortable. Hotel staff was courteous and helpful, there were lots of restaurants and shopping in walking distance. If you use foursquare and have a linked American Express card for promotions, keep an eye out for these promotions (for example, spend $10 get a $5 statement credit) in the area when you use the linked American Express card. We found the hotel was one, Wolfgang Puck Express a block away and Jimmy Buffett's Margarittaville.","Ocean Pines, Maryland","SilverSpringer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ocean Pines, Maryland</strong>",109,4.0

Arrival: I took the bus fromt the airport as I was traveling all by myself this trip and very light which worked out ok given the price of $2.50. Usually I use a private taxi service in Honolulu but I had the time and decided to save the money. It took about 1hr 10min and the bus drops off right on the corner across from the Hyatt Place with no transfer needed. Check In: They guy that checked me in was very professional and thorough and gave all the info one would need without needing to ask. Room: I had room x19 in the Diamond Tower. It was a small room with a King bed but I didnt find it too small especially for one person. If it was me and my wife and we had a couple of big bags it would have gotten crowded for sure. The biggest let down for me was the small lanai...not very much space at all so if you want to sit out and enjoy the fresh air there isnt much space especially for one person. I am coming back this weekend and will try for a room in the other tower as I think they have bigger lanais. The room has plenty of power plugs which is a HUGE plus and the TV has plenty of connections in case you bring your own entertainment. I found the bed comfortable and slept good. The chair with ottoman is comfortable and actually looked liked it pulled out to a single bed. The shower had ""OK"" water pressure and there was no tub. I do not like the carpet in the sink area but the Hyatt Regency has the same setup and I think it is crazy but whatever. My room also looked directly into the Ewa hotel but you will have that with this location. In all, the room is good with the exception of the lanai and the size. Internet: It is included with your room at this property and it worked surprisingly good. Usually you get what you pay for with regards to internet but no issues here. I used wired in the room and the wifi and both worked fine. They provide a wifi code when you check in. Breakfast: I was only here a couple of days and I usually have breakfast at Lulu's up the street but did check it out one morning and it looked ok for the price but the place was a bit of a zoo and just headed on over to my usual location. The breakfast is located on the 3rd floor essentially using the pool area.Dining: They have the usual Hyatt Place menu for various cooked items (microwaved is my guess?). They also had a happy hour during the evening but I did not try it out to check out the prices. There was live entertainment on Friday till about 9PM. Here is a link that has a menu of food items. http://i.waikiki.place.hyatt.com/Pool Area: The pool was really useless. You could fit a few people in there at the most so I would just go to the big pool down the street.....the ocean. Location: Best location, no. Good location, yes. You are just a couple of minutes from the beach and just a few more minutes walk to the central waikiki beach area. This property is on Kuhio which is usually a negative for me but it is at the end of Kuhio so you a bit away from the more crowded and somewhat les desirable area of Kuhio (in my opinion). A big plus is this property is almost across the street from the Banyan parking which is about the cheapest place to park in Waikiki so you dont have to walk far to get your car if you drive.Service: Ok, this is not like other Hyatt Place properties as it is really closer to a full service property. They have people to help with bags, concierge etc. Everyone was very friendly and helpful and couldnt ask for more with regards to service. Conclusion: I think this is a very solid option in Waikiki and seems to be very well run and has a lot of benefits to staying here. I will be returning next weekend and will decide after that stay if I want to bring my family here for a longer stay later this year as I just am not sure the rooms are big enough for my in-laws. Having a friendly and helpful staff goes a long way though.","Centreville, Maryland","tim_21617</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Centreville, Maryland</strong>",212,4.0

There is an ABC store next door for any emergency item you may need, too. It was a very clean hotel. Our room was a good size with a queen bed and a pull-out sofa. We had a small balcony that gave us a view of the ocean (although somewhat obstructed by other hotels - we could still see the ocean). The bathroom had the toilet and shower in one room and the sink was separate, which I liked. However, if you got up during the night to use the toilet, and you switched on the light, it lit both areas, which could disturb the other people sleeping since the sink area was somewhat ""connected"" to the sleeping area without a door to divide the two areas. The towels were removed daily and replaced with fresh, and as I said, it was very clean. The free breakfast was a bonus for us. Yes, it get crowded. You sometimes had to be patient and kind and wait your turn. We thought the menu items were fine. They offered 2 types of breakfast sandwiches, some type of waffe/french toast or pancake, fresh fruit, yogurt, oatmeal with plenty of toppings, cold cereal, pastries, a variety of juices, milk, coffee, tea, rice and toppings. We were not disappointed in the breakfast at all. Several mornings, I used the large tray from our room to get breakfast for my husband, daughter and myself and I would take it back to the room. My husband and I enjoyed ours on the balcony and daughter was happy to eat hers in bed while watching TV...that was a real treat for her. We did have a problem talking to the concierge because of long waiting lines. However, by our third day, they had hired additional staff and added hours which helped tremendously! We rented a car for four of our 12 days there, and the cost to park (valet parking) was $10/day. We also decided to have a bite to eat late in the hotel one evening before going to our room. We had drinks, pizza and a sandwich from the bar area while we watch the Olympics on their big screen TV. The bartender was super nice and it was quite relaxing and comfortable. We also noticed they had entertainment there another evening, but were were out so we didn't have an opportunity to enjoy that. This is not a ""luxury hotel."" We didn't expect it to be.

There was a substantial floor safe, small refrigerator, ironing board/iron, fliashlight attached to the ironing board area and a hairdryer. The free breakfast was great with quite a selection that changed somewhat from day to day. Oatmeal, cold cereals, varous breads, pastries, yogurts, fruit, two egg sandwiches, waffles or french toast, etc. The breakfast area is outdoors near the pool (which is small, although I never saw anyone in it).

I read the reviewed on TripAdvisor and among other sites and when we saw a sale for $150 a night, I booked it.Location:Only a few blocks away from the beach and you can walk to all the Waikiki shops rather quickly. It's at the end of the beach so it's not nearly as congested for traffic or people. Parking is also cheaper out here. We parked at the Ashton Banyan lot, which is kitty corner from the hotel. It was $12 a day with in/out privileges and $72 for a week. It was a great bargain. Other people I knew who stayed at a hotel more central had to pay around $30 a day. There are also numerous restaurants and dining areas nearby, although we didn't eat at any of them. There is an ABC store right next door if you need water and stuff like that, but we did a Costco run and got a case of 35 bottles for $6.Hotel Amenities:Room was a decent size with a safe (perfect for locking up passports and other valuables. I liked how the sink was on the outside of the toilet and showers. There was a balcony but we never used it. TV was rather large for the size of the room, and also swivels so you can adjust it. There are also plugs by the nightstand so we can plug in our phones and stuff. Free WiFi was nice, but I did notice it was flaky and I had to rejoin it often. It wasn't like that the first few days. The free breakfast was ok. I read reviews about it being a madhouse and people had trouble finding places to sit but I didn't find it that bad. Always found a table and the birds weren't a problem. They do have different items on different days. Some days there were pancakes and others there were waffles.Overall:The hotel was in a great location and I loved how there was cheap parking really close by.

The location of this property was perfect for us. Two very short blocks from the beach, walking distance from restaurants and shops. The complementary morning breakfast was very good and having 3 children this helped alot keeping cost lower for meals. We rented a car and maybe we got very lucky but found free overnight parking on the streets adjacent to the hotel, mainly around the zoo area every night.

The front desk staff member advised this was possible but it would be a King bed and much smaller sofa bed. We decided to risk it and checked in. Arriving in our room we realised it would be way too small, when I returned to the desk they were great about putting us back in the Mountain View room. That room turned out to be great. Two very comfortable Queen beds and a full sofa pullout. Two separate areas in the room plus two small balconies with a combination of city and mountain views. The pillows were too squishy for our liking but hardly a big problem.The free breakfast was fantastic every morning, although it would be great if it went longer than 9am on weekdays - most people staying in Waikiki are on holidays after all, however, when my sons didn't want to get up I just made use of the tray in the room and took them some breakfast.We got towels from reception every day to go to the beach and ordered room service for dinner a couple of nights which was priced VERY reasonably - you would pay a ridiculous amount in an Australian hotel.

First, the location is perfect - it's in the quieter part of Waikiki - one block to the beach and the zoo. There is an ABC store next door, excellent for stocking up on water, wine, etc.The breakfast is an excellent added bonus. I have read other reviews that complain about the breakfast - I'm not sure what people expect - but the breakfast was EXCELLENT. There are several choices, and the staff are constantly refilling and topping up supplies. The breakfast area is on the third floor patio, by the swimming pool, and yes, it gets busy, but we never had a problem finding a table. It also gets a bit windy - but its a welcome relief from the heat of the sun.We did have an small issue with our room upon arrival (we were a family of 3 and our room was only meant for 2) - however, the hotel staff made sure that we were moved the very next day to a City view room with a king bed and a double sofa bed. Thank you again to the staff who made this happen for us.Overall, we would not hesitate to recommend the Hyatt Place - the staff are friendly and helpful, the hotel is roomy and airy and the location is perfect.","North Vancouver, Canada","MJC1357</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Vancouver, Canada</strong>",14,5.0

We checked in late at around 10 PM. I had earlier called in about our late arrival. Check-in was smooth. They had advertised valet parking but the valet said that the parking is full but that parking is available at a nearby hotel. So we decided to park at this place and guess what, that was also full. So we drove around for about an hour and found nothing. Came back to the hotel and they suggested another hotel and luckily after about 1-2 hours after check-in we found a place to park. The valet 'assured' me that this is normal if you arrive late and besides it is cheaper to park elsewhere, so why should I trouble him at this late hour?The room on the 19th floor was very good with good maid service. No microwave in the room but there was a refrigerator and coffee machine. The breakfast was excellent with good kitchen/cleaning staff. There is a bar in the lobby but the grumpy bartender wants you to sit at the bar and drink even though there is a nice comfortable lounge nearby. There is a small place to buy food etc but you can easily buy everything you need at the ABC store one block away.All computers are normally occupied mostly by children. I tried to print my boarding passes but never got the chance until next day early morning. I was really excited and finally I printed the boarding passes. But unfortunately the printer had no ink. I asked the front desk and they sent someone with a new cartridge but it was for the wrong printer. So that did not work out.Except for these 'minor' issues the stay was good.","Kennewick, Washington","MillionBucks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kennewick, Washington</strong>",11,4.0

Everyone we encountered was eager to assist and generous with advice. Thomas, in particular, was gracious, diligent and expedient in effecting a room change for us when we had a problem with our first room. Ultimately, we loved the layout of our spacious room, furnished with 2 very comfortable beds and roomy sofa, as well as a lanai overlooking Kuhio Avenue. The sink and vanity are separate from the toilet/shower, which was convenient for our family. The flat screen tv was enjoyed by us all, and although we did not partake, there was also a small coffeemaker with coffee, as well as an assortment of teabags. The refrigerator and room safe were a good size.The breakfast included the following items each morning: 2 different hot sandwiches, either french toast, waffles or pancakes on a rotating basis, a variation of pastries, cinnamon rolls and/or mini muffins, granola, raisin bran and oat cereal, bagels, bread, strawberry and plain yogurt, oatmeal, fresh pineapple & melon, fruit puree, juices (tomato, apple, orange), milk (skim, 1%), starbucks coffee, various teabags, and a selection of Japanese food choices (rice, tofu, miso soup, etc.). It was adequate, but rather crowded at times. It was also windy most days, so a table by a wall or eating back at the room was more comfortable.The hotel's location was very convenient. Around the corner on Kuhio Avenue were bus stops, down the block towards the beach were trolley stops (in front of the Aston Waikiki Beach hotel) which we rode to and from the Ala Moana Shopping Center and Waikiki Beachwalk. There are many shopping and food establishments within easy reach. Just up the block from the Hyatt Place, half way to the beach, was an ABC store which we stopped at daily for water, snacks and souvenirs. Another minute farther, across Kalakaua Avenue, is beautiful Waikiki Beach. It was always busy there, but we never had trouble finding room to relax and enjoy the view.The hotel provides beach towels at the front desk, which we used for the beach as well as for snorkeling at Hanauma Bay. The hotel cafe was very convenient for a quick burger or snack when we were too tired to go out. The two gift shop have an excellent selection of souvenirs, surprisingly well priced!!!When it was time to leave, it was Thomas again who expediently checked us out, called us a cab, and bid us farewell. Overall, this hotel was an excellent choice for us. Its staff is superb. We would stay here again, and would recommend it without hesitation.","Manhasset, NY","ddmay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manhasset, NY</strong>",37,4.0

There were 2 queen bed and a sofa bed. The room is clean and larger than the typical motel, pillows are too soft to my taste. We stayed from 7/15/12 to 7/19. We booked late and paid the 21 day advance purchase rate of $254/night plus tax.You need to learn quickly to set the AC otherwise nights will be cold. Our room faces north and although we were on the 16th floor the only thing you will see are the massive 30 story towers between the Hyatt Place and the canal. Don't expect any view. Room and bathroom were clean. There was a flat screen TV with all the connectivity to connect your own device, i.e. iPad, portable DVD player, video game console. You will have to bring your own cable. This is typical for all Hyatt Place hotel.Free internet is provided.Breakfast was good although I expected some papaya, banana and apple but none were on the menu. We had english muffins with eggs/bacon or half bagel with egg/ham, yogurt, cottage cheese, cereal, pineapple chunks, cantaloupe, waffle, apple juice, oj, tomato juice, milk, real coffee, kim chee (yes), rice, toffu, danish pastries and I might have forgotten one several more items. Front desk staffs were very friendly as I frequently asked for hot water.We didn't use the pool, spa or gym.My complains are that there are only 2 elevators and sometimes you will have to wait. Also a family of 5-6 will have to wait to use the bathroom/shower. There is no microwave oven. If you have a baby/toddler, you will have to get hot water from the front desk and keep it in a thermos bottle. At home we use the microwave to boil water and sanitize baby's stuffs but here forget about sanitizing milk bottles, nipples, etc... If you rent a car, you can park at the canal (free) or on the street near the zoo (free from 6pm to 7am during week day). It's a very short walk. Very short walk to Waikiki beach too.Overall I like the hotel but next time I'll book somewhere else because I need a microwave oven.","San Jose, California","maifriend</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",18,4.0

The free breakfasts were very helpful to keep us on budget and while the area around the pool is windy, we ate breakfast here every day. We had 2 types of hot sandwiches, pancakes or waffles, pineapple, bread, bagels and pastries, Starbucks coffee and juices. You also have the option of using the tray provided in your room and going up to your room with your breakfast. We were given an Ocean View room which was very kind and while we asked for 2 queen beds and got a king bed and pull out couch (not really an issue for us), we still think this is one of the best places to stay - and the MOST comfortable beds ever! Our housekeeper, Adela, was a joy to deal with as she was efficient, and helpful (she was great with information about Oahu). Front desk staff was very helpful as well. Beach towels can be obtained at the front desk and just across the front desk is a little basket full of apples if you need a snack. The front desk also has a bus schedule. The beach is less than a 2 min walk down the street and an ABC store is right next door. Wolfgang Puck is at the end of the street, across from the beach. The beach as you walk down the street is walled in so it is protected from the waves (and surfers) making it more enjoyable to swim. The waves can be seen coming over the top of the wall when the tide comes in. It was full when we arrived but luckily I’d arranged for a day room (you do have to pay for this) as we had a very late flight out and needed the room until 8pm as they do not have a courtesy room. I’d highly recommend this place for cleanliness and efficiency.","Saskatoon, Canada","siesta4_1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saskatoon, Canada</strong>",50,5.0

That part didn't really matter to us because we didn't pay for an ocean view room.Once again, the bed was extremely comfortable. The room was a decent size and very clean. It was cleaned every day and fresh towels were available to us.The ladies at the front desk were nice and helpful. We had some problems with my mom's credit card and the issue was arranged within less than 24 hours by them. So we are grateful for their fast and positive handling of the situation.The bartender, Nick, and also the one in training at that point, Adam, were extremely nice, friendly, and helpful answering our basic questions about the island. They also made good Mai Tai drinks. Lucia, the housekeeper, was very nice and did a wonderful job cleaning our room.The hotel is 2 blocks away from the beach. It is 1 block away from an ABC store. It is really in a convenient location to everything.The buses stop right in front of the hotel, so if you want to adventure out on a city bus, how we did since we didn't have a rental car, you can do it in a fast and safe manner.The hotel overall is very clean and you can tell it was newly renovated.The breakfast area is on the third floor of the hotel. They start serving breakfast at 6:30am and I believe it goes until 9am. My mom and I were there usually around 7am. The place was always packed, regardless of the time we went to eat. They offer a variety of breakfast foods and they are always fresh. After a few days you do get sick of it, but I still believe that it is a cheaper option than paying 20 dollars for 1 person for a 3 egg omlette. So if you are picky than I suggest you find that place and spend your money. Unfortunately, the area for the breakfast is extremely windy, it is like a corridor between some tall buildings. If it rains than I suggest you take your food with you to the room. There are only a few places to sit under a roof, but those are taken very soon.The pool is very small and is on the same third floor. I've seen 1 person use it during our week long stay. Why would you even use it when the ocean is 2 blocks away?Ohh, and they have freshly brewed Starbucks coffee for breakfast every day which is liked by many of the American guests. Although I would like the hotel to brew the Kona coffee to support their own Hawaiian brand. The room, at nights, was a bit noisy because of the deliveries going on in the back and also from the people walking on the street. We didn't really mind that as we were exhausted from our days on the beach and on the island. I think this is a good hotel, very conveniently located to Kuhio, Sans Souci, and the Waikiki beach.","Cedar Rapids, Iowa","upsygirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cedar Rapids, Iowa</strong>",66,4.0

Due to a flight delay of nearly 7 hours we didn't arrive until 1.30 AM (by which time we had been up for more than 20 hours) but check in went reasonably smoothly, although we didn't really appreciate being advised to turn up for breakfast as soon as possible after 6 AM as ""sometimes its all gone after the first hour!"" In the event we took our chances and went down for breakfast on the pool terrace at around 8.15 AM, and there was still plenty of food available for everyone although the selection is fairly limited and it was rather chaotic, with no tables immediately available and a strong breeze blowing. Breakfast finishes at 9 AM on Monday to Friday which seems absurdly early for vacationers (10 AM at weekends is more civilised) but apart from one day when the danish pastries had all gone, we had no problem in getting what we wanted, although after the first morning we chose to take it back to our room to eat rather than hang around for a table.The room itself (cheapest available) was rather small but clean, modern & tastefully decorated. We didn't really use the lanai as it was very narrow, faced other high-rise buildings across the sidestreet, and didn't get any sun. On arrival the fridge wasn't operating - we reported it on our first morning but when we returned to our room late in the day there was still no sign of life! This time they sent an engineer straight up and it turned out that it wasn't plugged in, although there was no way you would know this unless you had managed to wrestle it out of its fitted surround - not something a guest should be expected to attempt!Like most affordable options around Waikiki, the pool is very small and not really suitable for a swim, nor is the terrace particularly inviting for sunbathing (only 5 sunbeds out at breakfast although they might put out more later in the morning). You are, however, only a few minutes walk from Kuhio Beach Park with its large beach pool, and the front desk will provide you with fresh beach towels every day to take with you. We also tried out the Hilton lagoon area and the beach in front of the Pink Palace, but actually found that we preferred the beach right on our doorstep. Hiring beach-beds, umbrellas, etc. seemed uniformly expensive right across Waikiki, so if you can take along your own bathing accessories you should save yourself quite a bit of money.Whilst in the room we did quite frequently hear a noise that we originally thought was the wind howling, however, it would appear that is was actually linked to something mechanical (possibly a lift shaft or ice-making machine), although we never quite pinned down what the cause was - thankfully we never heard it too late in the day or overnight. Otherwise I would say that the hotel makes a comfortable and adequate base provided you are planning on eating out a lot (in-house catering options are very limited), and don't envisage spending too much of your day in the hotel itself. The free internet access proved very useful, and by-and-large the front desk staff were fairly helpful.Eating out in Waikiki actually proved to be more of a challenge than we had anticipated - this hotel is on the eastern periphery of town so you will generally need to head westwards for eating options. Most restaurants seem to be attached to hotels or located in shopping malls, and the few options that enjoyed sea-facing locations seemed exhorbitantly expensive. Nearly all the decent affordable options were big and busy, and at dinner involved waiting for a table for up to half an hour - the food itself was generally good but service was very in-your-face and you tended to feel that they were trying to move you on as soon as you'd put your cuttlery down so the next paying (and tipping!) customer could be wheeled in. Certainly the restaurants we visited didn't feel conducive to enjoying a leisurely drink after your meal. Self-catering in Waikiki might be problematical, too, as there seemed to be a dearth of conveniently located supermarkets, so you might well find yourself confined to the limited options provided by the ubiquitous ABC convenience stores (on virtually every corner and attached to virtually every hotel). If you want something a bit more relaxed and convivial then you might well be better off basing yourself in somewhere like Kailua, which seemed more convenient for self catering as well as having quieter restaurants. Public bus transport on the island is cheap and fairly regular, so it should be feasible to travel between Kailua / Honolulu / Waikiki without too much difficulty, although we never actually tried it. Undoubtedly the beaches and climate are Waikiki's prime draw, and if you want to do it on a relatively modest budget then I would say that the Hyatt Park represents a fairly decent option. If, however, you are looking for the ""wow"" factor then I would suggest you look elsewhere although the chances are you will need to have extremely deep pockets!","Cardiff, United Kingdom","Stephen T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cardiff, United Kingdom</strong>",88,3.0

I was surprised to find so much more. When I first stepped onto the property, I immediately noticed the friendliness of the staff. The reception desk was extremely accommodating when I asked them to secure 9 pieces of luggage for 7 hours prior to us checking in. This friendliness was further evident in the valet drivers, bellhops, and the staff operating the morning buffet. When my oldest child was sick for one day, the staff went the extra mile to make sure sheets were routinely changed throughout the day and that all our needs were met. The friendliness of this hotel is truly remarkable, a testimony to the hotel's senior management for establishing such a culture. Parking. Parking is challenging anywhere in Honolulu. This is our third trip to this island and we knew what to expect. Unlike other cities, the hotels in Honolulu do not have shuttle busses to pick up patrons at the airport and take them to the hotel. Instead, you must either take a taxi or rent a car. Taxis will cost from 30-40 dollars each way. If you choose to use a taxi to arrive at the property, you can use the Honolulu trolley, which has several lines to choose from, to explore the Waikiki/Honolulu area. However, I wouldn't visit Oahu without visiting the other parts of the island where I believe the true beauty lies. To explore the island you will have to hire a driver, join a tour bus, or rent a car. If you choose to rent a car, you have two options to park at the Hyatt Place. For $25 per day you can have the valet park your car, which I suggest. The other option is to use a public parking deck across the intersection from the property. This will cost half as much.Breakfast. Many people choose this Hyatt property because of the breakfast which is included in the daily rate. It is a good deal and was one of the main reasons I chose to stay at the property. The breakfast area is located on an open terrace on the third floor. It is somewhat odd entering the breakfast area. First you must pass through an external door which first looks as if you are entering a maintenance area. You then pass by the hotel's pool which is one of the smallest I have ever seen for a major hotel. The breakfast area is modern, clean, and is designed to handle lots of people. There is a large array of breakfast options. I stayed clear of the ""breakfast sandwiches"" which were not tempting to me at all. My kids did try them and they were not impressed with the quality. Don't worry though. The oatmeal options, fruit, and yogurt were outstanding and worth it all. One last thing about breakfast, the eating area is an open terrace located between the hotel's two large tower structures. As a result, there is a lot of wind moving through that area in the morning. Don't forget to wear a jacket or sweater to combat the wind.The Room. We easily fit our family of five in a room with two double beds. One child slept on the oversized sofa with no problem at all. The room was large, clean, and modern in design. Our room was located on the 14th floor on the street side. As a result, we could hear lots of road noise even with the patio door shut. This hotel is a good choice for families staying in the Honolulu area.","Bangkok, Thailand","aj_travelboy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",23,5.0

Used the Hyatt as a one night stopover on the way home from Kauai. Check-in staff worked to accommodate our request for ocean view/upper story room (12th floor, oceanish view...). Were unable to accommodate our early checkin request due to hotel at capacity. Checkin staff was very helpful. Since we couldn't checkin early, they checked our bags, parked the car (Valet=$25/day; self park offsite=$12/day USE THE VALET...) and got us into the pool area. Room was clean, open, and airy. Linens fresh, shower clean, etc. We did have a problem with a clogged drain in the sink (We had only used it to wash hands and put nothing down it) and then the drain started to leak under the sink. Maintenance quickly there, quickly fixed, at 9:30pm! When we brought in CPK food, desk lady grabbed us plates and forks to take to our room. I'd give the staff ""6"" if I could. Everyone was helpful, attentive and friendly. Very laid-back casual, chic atmosphere. This hotel is NOT on the beach, but close. Pool is small, sheltered and on the 3rd floor. We didn't try the breakfast since we left too early (5:45am) and breakfast didn't start until 6:30am. Elevators required your room key to unlock upper floors.

Most important to me, my room was spotless and there was no bedspread, everything you see and touch is freshly laundered. The comfort of the bed was also in the top three of hotel beds I've slept in (bettered only by business stays at Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis) - I wish I could have taken it home with me. I was in an ocean-view king that was on the small side, but very attractive. The entire hotel was attractive and well-kept.For me, the included breakfast was perfect - biscuit sandwiches (egg, bacon, cheese, etc.), waffles, pancakes, little pastries, toast, cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit and more (including Japanese-style breakfast items). It was obvious that someone cared that the food was presented well and kept clean (again, a BIG deal for me, especially with buffets). Yes, the area got a bit hectic at times - lots of people going different directions. Tip: find a place to sit first (have someone hold the table). If you're solo like me, there's comfortable couch seating that works really well. Every Hyatt Place employee I encountered during my stay went out of his or her way to be nice and helpful (though I do think they were slightly understaffed, especially in housekeeping). For the reviewer who said there was no concierge, I can personally vouch for the fact that there was. I walked by his desk every time I came and went and he was there helping people - probably the hardest-working concierge I have ever seen. There are also computer workstations in the lobby where you can check-in for your flight, research excursions, even print free-of-charge, which was a nice surprise.I am a fan of this hotel and would recommend it to anyone! It might be a few extra steps to the beach (you'll be surprised to see how really close it is), and there's no room service, but it's a clean, pleasant, comfortable, attractive and reasonably-priced home base in Waikiki - the best I've stayed in yet.","Los Angeles, California","slross</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",11,4.0

Always had to wait at least 5+ mins for an elevators. When the elevator did arrive, it was frequently full and we had to wait for another. We were so tired of waiting once, we took the stairs - 17 flights! Pool is tiny. Breakfast area is way too small to serve the number of people. We had to fight for a seat. There is no one clearing and washing tables. Dirty dishes that you had to bus yourself were stacked up and overflowing for the birds to fly down and pick through.

In reading other reviews of other hotels, I was apprehensive about being nickel-and-dimed during our stay, as it appeared from many reviews that was standard practice for hotels in the honolulu/waikiki area. However, at the end of our stay, we had absolutely no incidental charges on our bill. (NOTE that we did not use the hotel valet parking; we chose to self-park at a nearby garage with lower rates). Included in our stay were the following: beautiful room w/ small lanai with a partial ocean view (view was obscured by nearby buildings but was still a good view); free breakfast; free in-room safe; free in-room wifi; free in-room coffee; free newspaper; and free use of beach towels to take to the beach and return when done. Fresh beach towels every day = wonderful! My kids were given free Hyatt Place sand toys/buckets to use as well. :) Friday night there was live music in the lobby. There were NO resort fees.The room was gorgeous, clean, and had everything we needed. We had a spacious room with two queen beds. There was plenty of room. I liked how the bathroom vanity area was separate from the rest of the bathroom. There was also a nice sitting area in the room. We did not experience any issues or problems with noise, either from adjacent rooms or from the outside/street area.The open-air lobby areas were very pretty. This hotel is not directly on the beach but is about a 2-minute walk. The heart of the area, which appeared to be in front of the Royal Hawaiian/Outrigger/Moana Surfrider, was within walking distance as well. If you are hesitant to book this hotel due to location (as I was - I thought ity would be too far from the beach) - don't worry about it - it is a non-issue - everything is very close.The breakfast was a real money saver. Advertised prices for similar buffets in the area were around $20/pp. Food/restaurants in the area are very expensive and it was great to save the money by not worrying about breakfast. This was not the typical made-in-advance and left on the counter type of hotel breakfast. It had many everyday items that we enjoyed - steel-cut oats with berry sauce, nuts/seeds, all the fixings; freshly made breakfast sandwiches that were being made right on the spot and were on a daily rotation so they changed a little every day (also, these were not just egg-bread-bacon sandwiches; they had gouda, muenster, guacamole, spinach, tomatoes etc.) My daughter has a dairy allergy and I simply ordered hers w/o cheese everyday - this 'special order' request was always handled with a smile and promptly served up, although they were very busy, and I really appreciated that. There were also pancakes, waffles, various yogurts, juices, bagels etc. and HUGE heaping bowls of fresh pineapple - (delicious!!) We were so happy with the breakfast here. Yes, the pool area is a wind tunnel in the morning, as other reviewers have stated, but the benefit here outweighs that small inconvenience of that. Plus it was nice to eat breakfast outside every day.We only used the pool once during our vacation. Although it had been important to me to book a hotel with a pool, we were at the ocean for all of our swimming! The pool was open until 10pm and is lit at night, which my kids did enjoy the one time they swam. All in all, a great experience for us. We were very happy with this hotel.

Only negatives were make sure you know if your room is prepaid or not, booked online for special pricing and secured room with credit card however it was not charged until we arrived and that was an unexpected expense on our first day. Also, room was reserved for 6 but housekeeping kept leaving just 4 towels, alittle frustrating when you are the last to shower.

The rooms are spacious and new. Breakfast is included, which is a good start of the day, but there are not a lot of options. Also, the breakfast area tends to get quite busy.

My room was a mountain view room and until midday I could sit on the balcony and sunbathe. However, Waikiki beach is about 5 minutes walk from the hotel, so therefore it is a must to go out.

The whole design is modern yet casual and comfortable (perfect for a Waikiki vacation) in addition to being impeccably clean. The beds are cozy and the air conditioner unit worked great. Complimentary breakfast and in-room Wi-Fi certainly add to the value, and the buffet offers a nice variety- breakfast sandwiches, waffles or french toast, oatmeal, toast, bagels, pastries, fruit, yogurt, granola, Japanese-style breakfast, and an assortment of coffee and teas were available daily. The staff were friendly and helpful, despite the busyness at the front desk. We appreciated that the hotel provided complimentary beach towels. There is also a reasonably priced 24-hour bakery/sandwich shop in the lobby, as well as a bar and computers guests can use.Cons: My husband and I were placed on the Mezzanine level, and our room was so small that we had to step over our suitcases to get to the bathroom. This issue could have been alleviated by scaling down some of the furniture (a large chair, ottoman, and a desk with office chair, plus a sizable dresser), but from the pictures that other travelers posted, it seems that our room was particularly tiny. Just something to be aware of when you book- inquire about square footage. While the customer service wasn't bad, it was obvious the hotel needs more employees. The front desk was always very gracious, but they were swamped with customers and there wasn't a separate concierge desk. Valet was extremely slow, which was a problem during busy hours when cars were lined up on the street, blocking traffic. Breakfast hours are limited from 6:30 - 9:00 a.m. on weekdays (10 a.m. on weekends). Finally, the pool is small and tucked away in a corner of the breakfast patio.Bottom Line: I would stay here again and endure relatively minor inconveniences if the price were right, as the most important elements- comfort, cleanliness, staff friendliness, and location- earn high marks.

Our taxi ride ended up costing $40 in the end, but we learned upon arrival that many hotels and car rental services in Waikiki offer a fixed-rate taxi service to and from Waikiki – HNL for $25-$29.We spent our first two nights in Waikiki at the new Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach, which opened roughly 6 months ago in December of 2011. The Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach is located just two short blocks away from the beach (literally a 2 minute walk), and there is an ABC Store adjacent to the hotel, which is great for stocking up on bottled water, snacks, wine (why pay $10+ a glass when you can buy two full bottles for $10?), sunscreens, etc.The average nightly room rate is about $294 during peak summer months, but I was able to book this property at a very good rate of $119 per night back in February using Hyatt’s best rate guarantee (related post). We enjoyed everything about this hotel; our room was incredibly spacious, new, and lively, and the staff was very friendly and helpful with local food recommendations.Another great thing about the hotel was the free in-room wifi, 24-hour fitness room access, and an impressive free breakfast spread. Breakfast begins at 6:30 am and consists of a variety of hot breakfast sandwiches, fresh fruit, fresh juices, an array of cereals/oatmeals, and even some Asian miso/rice/congee options. We knew breakfast at the hotel was going to be worthwhile when we saw a swarm of guests starting to line up as early as 6:10 am, and boy it was a madhouse by opening time.Another great thing that I just learned about Hyatt Places’ in general is that there is no early departure fee. This policy especially came in handy for us because we had to drastically shorten our Hawaii trip, and we would have lost our $119 rate if we had made any changes to the reservation online or over the phone prior to check in. Luckily we were able to inform the hotel at check in that we would be staying 2 nights instead of the 3 I originally reserved, and my $119 rate was secured.If you’re heading to Waikiki anytime soon, I highly recommend you consider the Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach. Sure, the Hyatt Regency Waikiki is nearby and offers ocean views, but this little gem is less expensive, newer, and totally a wonderful place to stay right in the heart of Waikiki!The exterior of the Hyatt Place Waikiki BeachVery spacious and bright roomFun corner sitting areaLarge flat screen TVModern and simple work deskBalconyThe vanity sink is separate from the bathroom and shower, making it convenient for getting ready!Portico bath productsFor the complete review, including pictures, please visit my blog at: http://boardingarea.com/blogs/justanotherpointstraveler/2012/06/14/hotel-review-hyatt-place-waikiki-beach/","East Rutherford, New Jersey","aaucello</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>East Rutherford, New Jersey</strong>",77,5.0

It is always nice to enter a room that matches up to the pictures and the marketing pitch, the 42 inch tv is certainly a bonus. The breakfast also matches up to the pitch and exceeds it. The only blemish in my stay that on the one day that my jet lag did not get me up in the middle of the night there was a false alarm at 6am forcing us out of our rooms. However, on the premise that safety is an imperative I have decided not to let this incident lower my rating as I am sure it's not a common occurence.On the whole Hyatt Place Waikiki beach rocks, especially considering the pricey accomodation on offer in Honolulu.","Johannesburg, South Africa","Mdawini</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Johannesburg, South Africa</strong>",3,5.0

Our teenaged daughter has great difficulty sleeping on pull-out beds. As we checked in, we learned our room had been ""upgraded"" from mountain to ocean view for free, but we found that the upgrade came with a cost: tiny, tiny room, and only one bed plus a ""mini"" pullout. We knew from our lengthy wait checking in that the hotel was heavily booked, with large groups who were taking up staff time trying to get their rooms closer together. We had heard, ""the hotel is full, there is no way to move rooms"" about a dozen times. So we were quite upset to learn that our reservation had been changed to a less desirable room. It took a lot of talk and some time, but the staff finally did move us to a new ""upgraded"" deluxe room that had two beds. The room was fabulous. I only regret that we had to fight so hard to get the two beds for which we chose this hotel. Special thanks to ""Jade"" at the front desk for finally resolving the problem. Overall, this is a very nice hotel and we enjoyed staying here. The breakfast was good, with a large selection and -yay - protein dishes! Not just the sugar/carb fest that most hotels seem to offer. The staff was really nice. The room was well beyond our expectations once we settled the bed issue. Very clean, pleasant stay. The only really objectionable thing I must mention is that the lobby (which houses the bar and cafe as well) is an open-air construction and we were overwhelmed by loud street noise and a sewer smell.","Seattle, Washington","goodlife100</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",11,4.0

There was also work going on at that side of the hotel and when we encountered very loud drilling we did ask to be moved and they said they would gladly move us. The only real problem I had here was when I had an early departure and was to be collected by the Speedishuttle. I called ahead to inform reception that I was expecting them and to make sure they knew my name as I wasn't down on the booking, in case they arrived early. As predicted speedishuttle came early and the hotel did not inform me so when I cam down I had missed the bus and had to wait 40 minutes for another one. This was partly because the manager was very relaxed and said they would arrive and i should just relax and wait, it was only when I spoke to another member of staff that the mistake was realised. I have to say though, once they realised the mistake he was very quick at calling the driver and they came over within 5 minutes to collect me.","London, United Kingdom","travelicious01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",42,4.0

We really have enjoyed the hotel & staff. Stayed in a ""City View/Deluxe"" room #1739.

Not faulting the hotel at all, but boy is it noisy in the late hours (delivery trucks, people talking on the streets, sirens). I'm sure Hyatt Regency is noisier with the police station across the street, which is one reason I changed my mind.

If you can't find something to your liking, you've got a problem! Never had a problem finding a seat, but choose close to a wall or it's windy....or use the tray provided in your room to carry breakfast back to your room to eat it at the small table or desk.

After an overnight flight it was great to be able to freshen up before heading out for the day. The room was lovely, on the lowest floor but I didn't really notice any noise outside. Nice comfortable king bed with gorgeous feather pillows, which are great because you can mould them to your needs. Yes there is beach construction, it apparently happens about every 5 years right along the beach. There is plenty of beach either side of it a very short walk away so I certainly did not find it to be an issue. The staff were all really nice and friendly, I asked one of the cleaning staff how to use the shower (you turn it to adjust the temperature rather than pressure, it's either on or off - something we don't have in Australia) he was more than happy to explain it to me and was really nice about it (I was half expecting a 'what are you an idiot' look after I realised how simple it was). The air conditioner was great, nice and new like everything in the room and worked really well to keep the room comfortable. There was a huge 42"" flatscreen TV, which to be honest I didn't even turn on, but nice to know it was there.

So I was unsure of what to expect staying in the city and a 3 star hotel. I traveled with my boyfriend and we are both in out 30's. We stayed April 23-28.Before traveling I called with several questions and the front desk staff was able to provide an answer for everything.Check-in was very easy and I enjoyed the added security provided by needing your key to get up the elevator. You may think this is a bother at first because its not routine to have to do this in an elevator, but after you realize how many people could come and go especially with the open lobby its a nice feature. There are apples in the lobby when you check in which is nice if you've been traveling. We requested a room on a high floor which we got. We came to do some photography, and although the view wasn't great, we could see Diamond Head from the side balcony. The room was spacious enough for our needs, especially considering we weren't there to lounge in the room. The bathroom was small but I was glad that the sink was separated from the shower and toilet; it would have made it very difficult to get ready if everything occupied one space. There is a fridge in the room which was great, along with a safe, and iron. We were on the 19th floor and there was a lot of wind whistling through the room. This was easily solved by putting a towel on the floor next to the door to act as a damper. Beds and pillows were comfortable; we got 2 queen beds and preferred a king, but not a big deal. I can see how the room could be a little noisy if you're not used to a city, but you are in a city, so I don't think you can complain. If you are going to get a hotel on the MAIN strip be prepared for more noise, as there are people playing instruments, etc. until at least 10:30 pm. Air conditioning worked very well. The lobby has computer access which is nice. We brought a portable hard drive to dump our memory cards and it worked well but took a long time. There is a bar in the lobby and food available ""24/7"" which was a little misleading, since we got in at 11 pm one night expecting to get a pizza or something else from their menu and was told there was only sandwiches to have. Then the bar tender didn't have change. There is no room service here, which is a draw back in these instances. Breakfast in the morning was great and a huge money saver as far as I'm concerned. There were sandwiches which they did make custom for a us because we don’t eat ham. There were waffles and pancakes on alternating days, fruit, bagels, toast, yogurt, cereal, oatmeal, and pretty good coffee. The only grip about the coffee was that they only had single serve creamers, and it would have been nice to have cream fresh. The breakfast area is VERY WINDY! Unless you are sitting in the alcove area. There are birds flying around, but if people didn't insist on feeding them, they probably wouldn’t be such a bother. There are towel available to take to the beach and you can park for $10 a day across the street at the Waikiki Banyan Hotel (going up to $12/day May 1) although still quite a bargain in Waikiki. Pool is small, but we weren't there to lounge at the pool. I found the hotel centrally located to the zoo, aquarium, and all the shopping. We walked the whole strip every night and was within 1 mile. GREAT SHOPPING!! I couldn't believe how many high end designers are in that area! Also a lot of great local stuff and ABC's on every corner. There are also places to go at the international market every night for a free Hawaiian show.The Hotel is a block from the beach, and there is construction going on but in no way does it interfere with you enjoying the water or sight seeing. There are plenty of other areas, you just need to walk 50 yards. Check-out was a breeze, and you can stay until 12pm which is a huge bonus if you have a late flight.I would definitly stay here again. If you have kids seems kid friendly as well.","rochester, ny","loverlylyllah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>rochester, ny</strong>",15,4.0

The rooms are spacious and the breakfast in the morning by the pool offers everything from eggs to fresh fruit/yogurt. The poolside breakfast was lovely, but be prepared to jump in if you have kids with you (it is small). The location is pretty far from the shops and is closer to the zoo, aquarium and park. The beach is close by. I would say the only draw back would be distance. If you don't mind the walk, everything is great.

They assisted us with our bags and gave us a quick tour as we were escorted to the elevator. We were told our room was just renovated, so we thought this may have happened like in the last few months. However, to our suprise the room was brand new. The room was so new it smelled new. Not like paint and nauseating fumes, but clean and well, new. The bar downstairs had some quick foods to order and they were yummy. We had a mountain view, that I must say was not that mesmorizing, but it was on the 12th floor and not too much street noise penetrated the room. Our room had a sleeper sofa, sleeper chair, and two doubles. The beds were SUPER COMFORTABLE!!!The television was huge and the bathroom has a walk-in shower and no tub. The sink and vanity is separate from the toilet and shower. We had breakfast included the next morning and it was wonderful to say it was supposed to be a continental breakfast.

This hotel is ideal for families, with breakfast and in room wifi complimentary, large refurbished rooms with pullout couches, lanais [views of apartments and hotels; with a tiny glimpse of ocean] with table & chairs and 42 inch flat panel tvs, as well as laundry facilities on 3rd floor. However, the beach which is one block away is under construction (yes the beach is under construction - with huge equipment, barricades, etc) and the closest usable beach is a 5/10 minute walk. The hotel is also under construction. The construction is in a separate building, but the noise is constant during the day. The street is also very loud with tours bus and trolleys honking and beeping day and night. We heard Hawaiian music all night long, every night. It was softly playing so we think the hotel intentionally has it on the lanais or perhaps the pool area? The front desk didn't know.The staff is super friendly, helpful and always available. The lobby and full bar area, which has to-go style food choices, have plenty of places to relax. Waikiki is bustling and feels like NYC set along a stunning stretch of ocean. There are plenty of homeless people and religious fanatics along the main street that runs parallel to the ocean. This is not the place for peace and quiet.We are a family of four, 2 adults and 2 teens. These are the activities we did:We hiked to top of Diamond Head [entrance fee even when walking in], allow about 1-2 hours roundtrip from hotel depending on your fitness. We took a cab back; $15 to hotel from Diamond Head one way.Toured Pearl Harbor [audio was worth the extra fee and we booked our time online in advance]. Tickets must be picked up one hour before your boat ride to the Arizona. There is alot to see and hear and the one hour was perfect amount of time to explore all the exhibits before the boat ride - you won't be standing around waiting for an hour, you will be exploring the excellent exhibits.Rented car and snorkeled Hanauma Bay; $7.50 per person, plus parking. You can rent snorkel equipment there or bring your own. There is a snack bar, but it is very slow. Plenty of facilities.Surfed at the beach in front of the Hyatt Regency. Surfboard rental $10/hour, umbrella and chairs, $50 all day or by the hour. Public restrooms are not pleasant.Aquarium is about 5-10 minute walk from hotel with wonderful exhibits. Two monk seals; tide pool area to hold sea urchins, hermet crabs; lots of different jelly fish exhibits; clam growing exhibit. We spent about an hour.Scuba Diving. Acquazone is one block away in the Marriott hotel. They have at least two dives per day. 8 people in our group with two guides and two tank dive: one deep and one sunken ship. Saw lots of turtles, octopus and tons of fish.Dining out can be expensive. Within one block is casual Wolfgang Puck Pizza and Starbucks. We had expensive meals at Hua Tree Restaurant (huge portions, outside tables on beach under banyan trees), Taormina Restaurant, Italian/Japanese fusion, and Orchid's in the Halekalani Hotel. Tons of chains: Roy's, Duke's (reservations needed at least few weeks in advance), Subways, California Pizza Kitchen are nearby. We didn't catch the name, but walking along the beach toward the aquarium -- make sure you are along the beach, not the street -- there was an outdoor grill/restaurant/snack bar that looked like it had good food.

The hotel was very clean, had up-to-date decor, and a good, comfortable bed. Looking out our balcony view we could see Diamond Head. The one down side to the room (#1840) is it is in a corner and sounded like a loud wind tunnel. So, the first night it was hard to sleep as the wind was so loud (also heard 4 ambulances but it was St. Patty's night so that is probably why). The wind tunnel noise was not quite as loud the 2nd night or maybe we were just more tired. The first day my husband spent a long time on the phone as our free room internet service was not working (he was transferred 3 times and they explained that they only had so many numbers available and they had to create a new one for him--we went downstairs to the lobby to use their computers as they couldn't get us set up for at least an hour.) There is a free continental breakfast which is about average for offerings and taste. There is a small pool but no hot tub. There is also an exercise room. The only parking available is valet at $25.00/day. Hotel checkout is at noon and they do not have a separate room you can shower and change in if you have a late flight. We had a 9 p.m. flight so they held our luggage from noon until 5 p.m.; however, we couldn't change or shower there after spending the day at the beach.

I have two kids ages 5 and 8. Nice location: 5 minute walk to the beach, Zoo and Aquarium. Rooms are spacious for the kids to move around in and there is a mini fridge in the room. We had two queen beds and the sofa is a pull out. First day we had a room on the 7th floor next to the elevators. Very noisy due to construction next door so we asked for a room change. Front end staff moved us right away. The front end staff is great; Thomas and Kim are very helpful. Let them know where you’re going and they will give you some great pointers and good local places to eat that where inexpensive and good eats. The complimentary breakfast was really good, breakfast sandwiches where tasty, juices and milk are on a cold plate to keep them nice and cool. Food staff are always replenishing the food and keeping the place clean. This hotel also has no resort fee and gives you at no charge beach towels to use everyday.I’m a electronics junky and this hotel has lots of plugs in the room. I have the kids ds games, camcorder, camera, tablets and phones to plug in and there was no problem finding a plugin. The free WiFi was the best I have seen in a hotel. Very fast. They also have computers for you to use in the lounge and printers so you can print out your boarding pass. I had problems printing my boarding passes and Thomas was nice enough to let me use his computer at the front desk. I rented the car for the week and was lucky enough to find free parking around the hotel. Best time to find parking is around 4:30 – 5:30pm. Staff are finishing work and you might be lucky to find a spot. Only negative things I can say is the cleaning staff could be better, elevators are slow and very windy at the pool and breakfast eating area. Our room that we changed into had hair in the bathtub strainer and you could feel sand on the floor. I understand that everyone must bring a ton of sand back from the beach so it didn’t bother me that much. The pool and breakfast area are together outside on the 3rd Floor. Very windy when eating breakfast. Try to get the seats closest to the breakfast food area. It’s a shame that they have a pool and its so windy and cold that hardly anyone uses this area. It looks nice and relaxing for the have a fireplace set up and lounge chairs to relax in. Maybe it’s the time of year we went that it’s not used.Overall it a nice hotel close enough to the shops and beaches but far enough that it’s not so noisy from the crowds. I would definitely stay here again. In two weeks I’m staying at the Hyatt Place in Bellvue Washington because I enjoyed the Hyatt in Waikiki so much.

The hotel is spacious and the staff is amazingly friendly. When I first checked in, I had a room facing Kuhio that was wheelchair accessible. Even though I didn't require it, It gave me more space so I figured it would be great! I showered quickly before heading out for the day and was horrified to see water EVERYWHERE! All the way into the carpet by the wardrobe outside the bathroom. I felt so bad and called the front desk to let them know what happened. I'm not a crazy extreme shower-taker, I didn't spray water everywhere, I swear! lol. Apparently they had had another issue similar to this and did not place any blame on myself, which I was very thankful for. The wheelchair accessible rooms have very different bathrooms with an open concept, and the water wasn't going into the drain in the center of the bathroom and instead had gone around and out the door. If you don't need it, make sure you don't get it! They moved me up to another room a few floors up facing the ocean. My room looked over the outdoor seating area and I had a nice view of the beach. There were no more shower mishaps from then on:). I was nicely surprised by how spacious my room was. The couch/seating area is very nice, but then again the whole room was. The rooms somehow remind me of the Mirage in Las Vegas. Same decor I guess? The bed was soft and comfy, and I enjoyed how the wifi was fast and easy to get onto. Other guests were a little loud at night, it was like everyone on my floor had to slam their doors at least twice before settling in. Outside noise wasn't much of an issue other than that one typical drunk guy yelling into the night out on the street. At least he sounded happy.The breakfast was another welcome surprise. I loved the hot breakfast sandwiches, and there was so much to choose from. Fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, cottage cheese, muffins, danishes. bagels, oatmeal.... and Starbucks coffee and I think it was Tazo tea. There was also a little area with rice and toppings for those guests visiting from Japan. Considering this is included in the price, this was wayyy better than what I've had in other hotels. The whole breakfast spot is very well kept... actually the whole hotel is. The pool is in the same area. I only went in it once, and I had it all to myself for an hour!The whole staff make this hotel even better. I never once walked through the lobby without one of them saying ""hi"" or ""aloha"" with a big smile on their face. Oh, I also left an article of clothing in my old room and only discovered this late at night. Went down to the front desk, and they helped me go back up to get it, no hassle whatsoever. Location is also great, I prefer staying on this side of Waikiki as I spend lots of time in the Diamond Head/Kaimana beach area. Parking on the other side of Kuhio in the Waikiki Banyan lot was $10/day with in and out, half the price of everywhere else I've stayed at. 5 mins to the beach and 10 to get to my other fave beach spot infront of the pink palace. I don't know if I could afford the normal ""rack rate"" for this hotel if staying by myself again, but I've already told tons of friends and family that they need to stay here if they find a good rate.","Vancouver, Canada","midnight143</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",24,5.0

The beach is closed and will be at least through April 2012. The Average rating for now is due to that fact. The pluses of this hotel are the good sized rooms. Perfect for families of any type. The beds in the two bed rooms are queen size, not double size. The free breakfast can be a time and expense saver. The 2 elevators are very busy during breakfast hours. Of course, many come to Hawaii for the beautiful warm weather, but there are downsides to having the breakfast area outside. When it rained, there was not enough covered space for all and getting breakfast was a chore. Other mornings, the wind could be unpleasant. Still other mornings it was lovely to be outside in the morning. The very spacious lobby was usually empty and I think it would make a perfect breakfast area. I wonder what it will be like when the 2nd tower opens. Will the current breakfast area be big enough to accommodate all? Views are best on higher floors but it is a gamble as to whether a room on a high floor will be available when you check in. We did request one when we booked the room pretty far ahead of time, but they could only give us what was available of course. We were on the 11th floor mountain side and our view was similar to other posted pictures. Views are partial due to the obvious fact that this hotel is 1 and 1/2 blocks from the beach and surrounded by other buildings. Lots of dining options are within walking distance. Parking garage on northwest corner of Kuhio and PaoaKalani is $10 a day with in and out privileges - quite a bargain in Waikiki.

Good # of channels-bathroom: large shower (no tub) and toilet in one room; large sink outside-room amenities: cordless phone, small fridge, large safe in closet, nice spacious shelf. free wireless HSIA, free local calls (charged but removed at checkout)-free extended continental breakfast: choice of 2 hot sandwiches, slow-cooked oatmeal, triple-berry bowl (defrosted). fresh-cut fruits, cereal, steamed rice, miso soup--with attentive service, in an open-air terrace next to the small pool.-fitness center: one of the largest, best-equipped one I've seen. The latest LifeFitness treadmills, ellipticals, and bikes. Good temp control. Rarely crowded.-free computers with printer in lobby areaCONS:-A/C: very loud air-conditioner; I finally got used to it but can be extremely irritating initially-loud doors: there is no way to gently closed the room door without waking the dead or your neighbor. Luckily, our neighbor did not come and go often.-no wired HSIA: wireless was out of order on the last night. I thought it was quite funny that when you signed on initially, the home page T&C warned you that wireless HSIA is not secured and you could have sensitive info intercepted--so why don't you offer wired (safer) HSIA in the first place?-fan in bathroom: there is a switch which turns on the ""fan"" but you can't turn it off--I think it's preset for a fixed time and then automatically turns off","Portland, OR","PDXBigGuy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, OR</strong>",39,4.0

After a flight cancellation and lots of mess getting there, we were happy to find that our hotel was very nice, despite the star rating. I guess we expected it to be a little old or find bed bugs or something- we were pleasantly surprised! Our check in was a little difficult because we had booked ahead and as I said our flight was cancelled so we extended our stay but the hotel was full and unable to accomodate our extra three nights. After hearing our about our rough start, the check in staff gave us a very nice upgrade. We ended up in a King Suite on the 18th floor with a very nice mix of views. We could see Diamond Head, the city lights and the ocean from our balcony.(I am told that every room has its own balcony) The room was clean and spacious and updated nicely. The bathroom had a glass doored walk in shower. The sink and mirror are separated from the shower and toilet by a locking door. The mirror was large and awesomely lighted. As I said this was a king suite so it had a sectional sleeper sofa that was separated by a partial wall from the king bed. The bed was comfortable and had very cozy bedding (I truely appreciated this as I was layed up in it for the two days following our arrival due to a fire alarm.) I can't blame the hotel staff or owners for the misfortune we had on our 1st night. We were very excited to have the 18th floor upgrade until......At 4am we were sent running down 18 flights of stairs due to an alarm sounding telling us to there was an emergency and we must evacuate! My daughter had forgotten that we were in a different time zone and had already woke us up (thankfully) so it was easy for us to head to the stairs in a hurry. After running all the way to the lobby, we were informed that the alarm had been triggered by someone breaking into the other tower on the propery that was being renovated. This caused my legs to ache for two or three days, as I am not in very good condition, physically. My husband thought the hotel should have offered some kind of compensation for our trouble, but I reminded him that we had already been upgraded to a very great room, so he let it go. Another high point to the property was their all you can eat breakfast. The sandwiches were good, as was the fruit and rice, but my favorite things were the danish that they made fresh every morning. The main downfalls were the pool -small with no hot tub, but hey, there is an ocean close. The other thing was the walk to the beach, not too bad but it is a good two blocks and the closest beach area was being renovated so we had to walk even farther, so we spent alot of time walking. Overall, I give this place a good review because it was new and clean and the staff was friendly.","Fair Play, Missouri, United States","MommaT5676</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fair Play, Missouri, United States</strong>",7,4.0

But since I was the only one complaining I thought maybe my skin was just dry. On my last night here I found a bed bug in my room. I called the front desk and was laughed at and told that Hyatt is a clean hotel and they don't have any bed bugs. If there was a bed bug, it must have been carried in by me. Wow, are you kidding me right now?!? Then I'm told the manager will come look at my room. The manager tells me that it's not a bed bug, he has had bed bugs in his house before so he knows what they look like. I tell him that's funny cause I just googled images of bed bugs and the bug looks dead on. Then he says it looks more like a flea and he's had fleas at his house too. Beyond disgusted! So we are moved to another room and it's past 3 am and I can't sleep because I'm creeped out that I've been sleeping 5 nights in a room with bed bugs. After inspecting my body I found several bumps. I'm very disappointed in the way this was handled. I've stayed at plenty of nice hotels and this has been the worst experience I've ever had.

If this had been a business stay, it would not have mattered because we would have needed to be up early anyway. Also, the housekeeping staff is extremely noisy. Instead pf placing their carts in front of the rooms, they throw the locks and bang the doors as they go in and out many times. It's quite distracting.

The only pinch I felt was on $25/night valet parking charge but their staff directed me to a public self parking garage across the street for $10/ day with full in-out privileges. They made our Waikiki stay very pleasant and we will be sure to stay there on the next trip too.",,NareshKSehgal,12,5.0
