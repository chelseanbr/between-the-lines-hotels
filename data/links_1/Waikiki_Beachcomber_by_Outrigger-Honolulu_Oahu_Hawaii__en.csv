Hotel was great very friendly staff and rooms where clean & comfortable. My best experience though was with Malia Akiona who was on the concierge counter. Malia was so friendly and so very helpful that we would find a reason just to go talk to her. Nothing was a hassle or problem and was always so happy to answer our questions or help organise our days.

This hotel is across the street from the beach in a central location to restaurants shopping etc. (Best location in my opinion and no need to book a hotel that's on the beach). We had Michael check us in and he was awesome the whole trip. He helped us with places to go for activities and tips and tricks in the area. He really went above and beyond for his job. The rooms are very nice, we had a partial ocean view and it practically had a full ocean view. We had breakfast at the Aroma Cafe every morning included in our room package and it was very good. Trolley service was awesome it goes everywhere you need and is included in your amenities fee. Overall a great hotel to stay and good value for the money you pay. The only thing I would warn about is the Concierge that is in the hotel and outside works for Expedia so they try to sell you their packages and do not provide any value to our stay.

I booked the Waikiki Beachcomber based on the great feedback it was getting. As our flight was moved to an earlier time from LA and we were arriving in HNL at 9am and had a 15mo we were a bit stuck for options especially given the early start. I contacted the hotel regarding an early check in with everything setup for our daughter and it was a hassle free conversation. Upon our arrival to Beachcomber, our check in was effortless too, starting with the team at concierge service, to the front desk and finally getting our bags delivered to the room. We stayed in a partial sea view room which was clean and tidy. It was a very new room and spacious. It had a balcony that could be used to go and sit out on. Also it came in handy to dry any wet clothes as well.The bed was a large comfortable king size, the room was well laid out as well. The bathroom vanity area was outside of the shower area which was good in some ways and the shower, toilet were in a separate room. The shower was spacious with good water pressure as well.The Beachcomber is located right on the strip of Waikiki centre and opposite The Cheesecake Factory and a few doors down the Waikiki Centre. It is about a 20 mins drive from the Airport and only 10 mins from the Waikiki Plaza. There is a cafe and the famous Maui Brewing Co located as part of the hotel. There is a rooftop swimming pool also in the hotel however this was quite small compared to the number of guests they get so can get cramped. The beach is pretty much across the road but this is shared by the many of the beachfront hotels so the good spots that can be used by all is about a 10-15 min walk.The hotel does provide tickets (we got ours as part of the package) for trolley buses which picks you up near the hotel and doesthe trip to all major attraction points so you can do things such as the Market, Diamond head peak and more.All in all, Waikiki Beachcomber is a new hotel in a well located area in Waikiki.

Get a nice tropical drink and get in the hot tub while enjoying the skyline views and the street activity below. Maui Brewing has a restaurant there that is ok but it is not fine dining by any means. We enjoyed a small lunch there but then when out for diner later that night. The little shop next to the pool has snacks and alcoholic drinks and is open most days until 6pm. We had the breakfast included and this little cafe is also where you get your breakfast.

The Expedia Concierge in the lobby is an absolute scam and is a poor reflection on the hotel. I was talked into the helicopter tour because ""it gave the best view of Pearl Harbor."" It did not and the whole experience was awful and a scam. This is a very poor reflection on the hotel! Choose your concierge staff better or get them out of your lobby! The elevator situation is a disaster - you must show your room key to use the elevators. While this could be a nice safety feature, it actually creates more problems. People are in the way while others are trying to get on and off the elevators. Also, if there is security there, they should help prevent guests from cutting in front of other guests waiting for the elevators! This happened multiple times per day on every day of my stay.The pool is tiny. The service at the pool for drinks is abysmal. The rooms are lovely and the bath products smell wonderful! The front desk service is rude. I stayed 2 separate times - at the beginning and end of my trip. I paid to upgrade my room on the front end of the trip and on the back end, asked for a courtesy upgrade as I now had a car and was paying parking and valet fees. I had also spent a significant amount of money in the hotel each time. The front desk agent just laughed and refused to answer my request. The hotel had a lot of availability and I didn't think it was unrealistic as a repeat guest to ask for a courtesy upgrade since I was already in a fairly expensive ocean-view room!","Needham, Massachusetts","TravelChick0217</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Needham, Massachusetts</strong>",16,4.0

First of all the rooms are beautiful, functional, modern and extremely clean. The hallways to our rooms were bright and clean. I could probably hands down say that the rooms are nicer than the big hotels across the road on the beach as we have stayed many times at them all. Which for us made up for the fact we weren’t staying on the beach. It didn’t even matter and was still a fantastic location. The house keepers were always lovely, patient and understanding with our babies nap times. The pool area is lovely but as expected like most hotels in Waikiki the pools are small. Not a deal breaker because your right across from the beach. Love that the hotel has laundry facilities on the parking level because I’m not a fan of bringing home dirty laundry or having damp clothes all through the room. A big THANK YOU to the staff for retrieving an expensive baby swimming costume that flew off the balcony and onto the roof because we didn’t secure it properly. Only a couple of negatives the front desk staff were not that pleasant or welcoming which was disappointing. We found them quite patronising and would suggest that maybe they take a leaf out of their wonderful housekeeping staffs books that will make a massive difference in their customer experience.The escalator leaving the hotel going to the street was out of service the entire time which meant you had to wait for the lift which was always busy.

I was happy it was a corner space with West views of Diamond Head and South views of Kalakaua, and the beach. It is on the 19th floor and views are obstructed with the Moana Surfrider and Sheraton in front but still nice. The front balcony is traffic noisy and the last bits of sunset are unfortunately blocked. On the plus side, New Years Eve fireworks were right in front of us - clear view from a barge in Waikiki Beach. The Beachcomber is not luxury, but a quality 4 star. We were happy with what we booked for the large space and convenient/central location. Elevators were busy.

I only made a reservation at this hotel because the Waikiki Beachcomer was already sold out. I walked over to the Waikiki Beachcomer, a hotel that I've stayed at before, and went to the front desk and spoke with Kiana, the front desk manager. I told her my situation and she worked with me to see if there were any available rooms that night, my first night in Hawaii. After 30 minutes, Kiana found a room that was available for the duration of my vacation so I booked it. I went back to the other hotel to cancel my reservation there. Though I had to pay a penalty for the cancellation, it was worth it to get my family to a quality hotel to make this vacation a memorable one. I especially want to thank Kiana for her outstanding customer service to help me and my family get a room here and enjoy our stay at this hotel.

The balcony doesn't even face the water and was so tiny and unpleasant you wouldn't go out there. The room is clearly not a Waterview so don't be conned if that's what you think you are paying for. The elevators are terrible and slam shut. I was hit so hard by one my coffee spilt all over me and the lift as I walked in. The pool is small and was usually crowded. The front desk staff are very friendly and the best part of the place. The room is nice enough but thinking we had a Waterview for our holiday and being what I believe as tricked really turned me off.

The down side was breakfast, it is in a cafe in the lobby. I found the food to be average without much variety, the main choice was waffle or bagel and a coffee. I wasn't impressed by the quality or freshness of the food and skipped eating here a couple of morning to find something fresher to eat. The hotel elevator was out when we were there but that doesn't reflect on my opinion of the hotel as it will eventually be fixed. I also thought that for such a large hotel the pool was tiny but I suppose the beach is within walking distance but you need to get there early to book an umbrella.

We were paying Aus $10 for a cup of coffee!!Hotel itself in a Great position right in the heart of Waikiki, opposite the Cheesecake Factory which everyone knows if they have been before. Mauii brewing company is part of the building as well with direct entry from hotel. Quite small pool so dont really consider this as a resort hotel, pool nice for a quick cool off. Generally excellent hotel, staff all good, rooms well looked after and comfortable. Small cafe/ bar in lobby serving pool area and lobby not bad coffee( for an Australian). Only complaint was it was very noisy on occasion. Bins got emptied in side lane very early and also next door had party on balcony until 2.30am and then got up early to leave a couple of days later and they sounded loud enough to be in our room.

Great location, spacious rooms, clean, quiet, good value. The lifts are being renovated at present, so can take a long time for the lifts to arrive but the hotel does warn about this in the lobby...The downside that we and others we spoke to encountered was the pool area, with children being able to run around the slippery surface, dive bomb splashing numerous patrons and take over the spa with out parental intervention. What was worse was that the hotel did nothing when large groups of adults took over the pool areas, intimidating other guests so they could take over the pool and play games. The hotel did not intervene. Many other guests we spoke to felt like they could not use the pool and went to the beach instead. Convenient market in foyer, cute trolley that is free for hotel guests, only runs every 1 1/2 hrs on loop. Attached brewery is $$$ but can be nice for a meal or drink.

Secondly, their pool is so kid friendly that my son and nephew never wanted to leave whenever we would use the pool in the facility. Even I enjoyed the pool and even I didn’t want to leave. Lastly, I must say, the location is the best! It is right in the heart of Waikiki, Kalākaua to be exact, and it is close to many different shops and restaurants that you can visit. All within a walking distance.

Plus they have a good kids menu. We also visited for Happy Hour which is great value for an early dinner as appetizers and pizza are included. One morning, we took advantage of the complimentary Outrigger shuttle and hiked up Diamond Head. The shuttle can also take guests to the Ala Moana mall.

However, we were disappointed with a few aspects. Firstly, we arrived at about 11:00 am after our overnight flight from Sydney. We knew check in time was 3:00 pm but I did ask if we could check in early. We were told this would be possible if we paid about an extra $US50. I think that is a bit of a rip off - the room was already ready and may well have been the room we were actually allocated for a 3:00 check in - what is the justification for the extra charge? No display of goodwill there. The Aroma Coffee shop is in the hotel complex, adjacent to the pool but we could not charge anything from there to our room - that should be changed. There was one Concierge who really did not have much knowledge of the area; we asked for advice late one morning where we could get an omelette breakfast to which he replied we were too late for breakfast in the area - really, we had a delicious omelette breakfast 10 from where he was sitting - Maui Brewing Co, part of the hotel! On our last day the entire pool area and Maui Brewing Co was closed for a private party. So for one quarter of our stay we could not utilise the two best aspects of the hotel. There was no mention of this when we checked in or to anyone prior to that day - very poor. I was extremely annoyed and after complaining at the front desk I was offered a refund of the Daily Resort Charge, $US34. I believe everyone in the hotel should have been given this discount - two of the main resort facilities were unavailable all day! Finally, in an email I received from the hotel asking for feedback on our stay I mentioned all that I have done here. In response I received a stock standard generic reply from the GM, Ike Cockett - how impersonal and very disappointing.

The rooms were very well appointed, newly refurbished and a good size. We both particularly appreciated that the shower was not over a bath! The hotel is next door to the International Market Place, across the road from Waikiki Beach, within walking distance of 4 of the Waikiki Trolley stops. We ate across the road at the Cheescake Factory, down the road at the California Pizza Kitchen or down Duke's Lane at Duke's Lane Market & Eatery, just to name a few places. Of course we also had meals at the Maui Brewing Co, and at Aroma Cafe, both of which were withing the hotel complex. There was also a small shop that which was competitive to the ubiquitious ABC stores around town. I also can't fault the staff at the Hotel. The following section shouldn't be considered criticisms of the hotel; rather they are bits of info that a traveller probably should be aware of. We had an Ocean View room which overlooked Kalakaua Avenue, and eventhough we were 12 floors up, noise from the street and particularly the Maui Brewing Co outdoor bar area filtered up to us fairly unhindered. Therefore, if you are sensitive to street sounds etc, perhaps book a partial ocean view or Waikiki view room. Also, to be fair the sounds died down by around midnight most nights. I'd aso suggest that the Laundry be expanded. There were only 3 machines and one was out of order the entire time we were there. Last year we stayed at the Outrigger Waikiki Resort across the road directly on Waikiki beach, and to be honest, I'd prefer to return to the Beachcomber on our next trip back to Oahu, whenever that happens.","Wantirna, Australia","Seekereleven</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wantirna, Australia</strong>",6,5.0

I was so impressed by this hotel that I have to include some words.The location is great and not so great -- depending on what you want. It is right in the middle of the main street in Waikiki so is handy to everything. BUT there is no beachy feel -- it is not beach front and doesn't feel it. It feels more like a boutique hotel than a beachside resort. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning if that is important to you.The pool is also on the tiny side. From what we saw in Waikiki this is usual -- but being from Australia we are used to resort pools that are huge and have hundreds of sun loungers, especially at the Aussie Outriggers. This is a square pool, the kind you would find in a city motel, and there are buildings in the background. Again, not a big deal -- but if you are looking for a more resort style hang, this is not your place.Now that those things are out of the way.....the hotel itself has reopened with a plush reno about 5 months ago. Maybe they are trying hard right now, but it is just top notch. The staff at the desk go the extra mile to be helpful, courteous, give you advice about Waikiki and Honolulu. The luggage staff are mixed -- they are nice, but a bit sleepy. Our bags weren't even in our room when we had checked in 6 hours earlier. The room itself is a highlight. We also stayed at the Outrigger across the road for a night early in our Hawaii holiday. It is positioned perfectly on the beach and has a bigger scale holiday experience within it, but that building and the rooms are tired and musty and old. The rooms here at Waikiki Beachcomber are among the nicest I have stayed in -- fresh, modern, beachy, spacious.

We enjoyed everything about our stay and would love to go back in the future.The Beachcomber is located in the heart of Waikiki and our room had a nice view of Waikiki beach. Our room was always cleaned beautifully and housekeeping staff were (overly) generous with towels, toiletries and other accessories. In fact, every staff member we met were friendly and couldn't do enough for you to make your holiday extra special. The friendly staff at Beachcomber were a highlight of our stay.We also felt safe with security being quite visible in the hotel and no access to the floors without a key card.The pool was quite small and this was the only downside to our stay. The pool was always over run by children and although they were having fun some of the things they were doing were not safe and no one (including their parents) stopped them or even looked like they cared about the impact their games were having on other guests. (They also took over the spa on many occasions) They tiles around the pool are very slippery when wet and I slipped twice although I did not fall - this could be very dangerous, especially for older people.We enjoyed breakfast and drinks at the Aroma Cafe, although service is a little slow and my daughter enjoyed nights at the Maui Brewing Company. We also ate once at the MBC but there are better places to eat at as better quality and affordability can be found in other restaurants close by.The Waikiki Beachcomber is located near Waikiki Beach and within walking distance to major shopping areas. Their trolley and public transport stops are also close by and easily take you to all other points of interest.Overall the atmosphere and friendly staff at the Beachcomber helped make our holiday memorable and I highly recommend staying here.

Firstly, the process to order food there takes soooo long - the person taking orders is so slow causing excessive lines (waiting up to 30 minutes just to order). The second day we asked to upgrade our breakfast from what the coupon provided and they charged $20 US for us to upgrade from a ham and cheese croissant to two eggs on toast. By the time we got to the fourth day of our stay, they decided instead of bringing our food to the table they would call our numbers and everyone would collect their food (lack of constancy, obviously just doing what they felt on the day as on the fifth day only every second person had their coffees brought to the table).For four straight days, we were told the 12 oz acai bowls were included in the coupon (which we did and then paid $3 to upgrade to a 16 oz), on our second last day they decided that we would have to paid full price for a 16 oz and pay $3 to upgrade to a 12 oz.

All of the common areas and rooms have been completely renovated and so everything is really fresh and new. It is located smack bang in the heart of Kalākaua Avenue close to the beach, close to all of the shops and attractions of the main strip. You could not get a more convenient spot. The hotel has a driveway off Kalākaua Avenue and valet parking, so really easy if you’ve hired a car and need to come and go. Rooms are a good size for Waikiki, and on higher floors will have a great view. Our room on 22nd floor faced Diamond Head and had a great ocean view. Lovely beach decor, comfy bed and a well designed, very new bathroom. Great service from everyone we encountered, our room was refreshed with complimentary bottled water daily and we enjoyed eating breakfast at the in-house café. The pool area is smaller than some of the other hotels but perfectly fine, the café serves meals and cocktails poolside and there were ample lounge chairs and towels available. There was also a hot tub/spa.Overall, for the price the Beachcomber is a great choice in Waikiki. We have stayed at the Moana Surfrider and the Royal Hawaiian, which are more expensive and have the advantage of being right on the beach. But the lower price point of the Beachcomber makes it a really attractive option in Waikiki.","Rozelle, Australia","Fussy123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rozelle, Australia</strong>",42,4.0

I think I have a good grasp of what should and shouldn't happen at a hotel from my experience and this one just rattles me still. This is all from my own experience.1. There was a fire at this hotel. I know this isn't the hotels fault. However, the customer service during the fire was atrocious. People staying at the hotel were ushered out of the hotel late in the evening. Many of them had robes and pajamas on since a lot of families stay here. No representative was available to give updates or to provide a place for families to stay temporarily. There are several Outrigger locations and a banquet hall could have been opened for people to at least sit and let children get some sleep. Many parents had small children and were forced to shop or find a small bit of waikiki that was comfortable enough for a toddler to sleep on. No updates were given. Instead guests shared information with each other when the doors were reopened at almost 1:30am. I was one of those parents and I ran into several others in the same predicament. After the fire, no recompense occurred and a simple chain letter was slipped under doors. While I don't expect much the apathy of the hotel chain was unacceptable.During the next few days professional cleaning crews were present to get rid of the smoke smell and whatever else they do. They were awesome! They were professional and went the extra mile to assist guests in the hallways. Personally they held doors open and offered to take garbage from people they saw in the hallways. The hotel staff in comparison only cleaned the rooms and not any other areas of the hotel. Since elevators were affected due to the cleaning and fire escapades we had to to utilize the stairs. For two days I saw the same wet soggy toddler socks and an empty Starbucks coffee bottle in the stairway leading from guest rooms to the lobby. It wasn't picked up and the stairway was never cleaned as far as I could tell.Additionally, the night we returned to our room we had to pass security because someone had broken into the room next to ours while the fire escapades occurred. It happens, not much you can do about that in a fire. However, there was no proactive response for several days. On our third day at this location, and two days after the fire there was a security guard posted at the elevators that were now working. Never was there a security guard posted at stairways that all guests had to utilize to gain access to their rooms during the prior two days. This is unacceptable. Additionally, only the main lobby elevators had a security person in-place. Please update your security to provide a safe haven for guests. There is better security measures at hotels that cost less.Lastly, the escalators were needing maintenance at this location on my last day here. I usually don't care, but when there are multiple fails this just adds to everything. Instead of doing the maintenance at night or maybe doing the down escalators after the check-out period (they shut them down without notice at 0700 when I was leaving) they had shut them off at the prime time for people to check out and leave. Kind of a pain when you are trying to depart. Not to mention we had to show our receipts to the security guard, who just saw us depart the elevator to check-out, in order to get back on the elevator for the ground floor (lobby is on the second floor).Please improve your processes, cleanliness, and improve the customer service at this location. It's a nice hotel don't let it tarnish the other outrigger locations.","Okinawa Prefecture, Japan","blackhawke2019</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Okinawa Prefecture, Japan</strong>",3,2.0

Very quiet, I didn’t hear any noise from neighbouring rooms. The staff were attentive, helpful and friendly. Anita from house keeping looked after me beautifully. The Maui brewery company restaurant downstairs was a great spot for breakfast, dinner or a late takeout, and we had some fun nights at the Duke over the road. You are in the centre of everything and it’s great people watching below and feeling the Waikiki vibrancy from the comfort of your lanai, or wandering across the road for a swim. The elevators were a little slow, but it didn’t bother me at all.

We stayed in the deluxe ocean view room with diamond head view on the 19th floor and the view was stunning. No obstructions, full view of diamond head and waikiki beach from the front of the moana surfrider down to diamond head. The price of a similiar view at a beachfront property would likely be 2-3x more expensive, so that in itself was a great bargain. Street noise dies down around 9-10pm, but unfortunately, there is still a large AC unit for the international marketplace down below and its humming drowns out any sound of waves crashing. We tried to sleep with the sliding door open, in hopes that the sound of waves would come through at some point, but no such luck, and we ended up having to close the door because the hum of the AC unit was just too loud. In Waikiki, I don't think you're going to get the sound of waves in your room unless you are at an oceanfront property - and even then you may have to be in an oceanfront room or room very close to the beach. The rooms are really nicely furnished, nice bathrooms, dual-head showers, brand new very comfy bed. The location is directly across the street from the Outrigger Waikiki Beach, which, in my opinion, is the best stretch of sand on waikiki, so walking to the beach is super easy - less than 5 minutes. The hot tub and pool are recently renovated and good enough. Hot tub is very large and well-heated, so that does the trick. There are some nice day beds on the patio free of charge. The coffee shop in the lobby is also good and convenient. Customer service is great. If you call Outrigger directly to book they are super nice and beat other rates, and they were also incredibly helpful when we had to reschedule our trip due to a family emergency - no change fees and they let us keep the original rate even though we were rebooking on very short notice. The downsides: - From the street you do not enter a lobby, rather, you ride an escalator up to a windowless lobby that, although renovated, doesn't totally give that aloha/hawaiian charm feeling. Not the end of the world.- The way they make you enter and exit with your luggage, down to the street level on elevator rather than taking the escalator needs to be improved -- your first impression entering the hotel is walking down a weird alley past the giant trash dumpsters that absolutely reek in the heat. I honestly can't believe this is the best situation they have devised. It's really off-putting and should be changed. Definitely my biggest complaint with this property. If beachfront properties are out of budget (or you don't want to be staring at the towering hotel next door) and especially if you desire the strip of beach from the Moana Surfrider up to the Royal Hawaiian this is a great option.","San Francisco, California","Alexandra M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",23,4.0

The hotel is modern and fresh looking, and the rooms are large with a nice size balcony. We got an Ocean View King Size room. It was nice. The one downsize was that on the 14 floor, we could hear loud fans noise from the roof next door while sitting on the balcony. The noise is muted while the baloney door is closed. Friendly staff at the drop off, bell services, front desk, and house keeping. The internet works well. The TV is a large screen flat on the wall.

The hotel is 1 street from the famous Waikiki Beach 3 min walk down dukes lane that is almost across the road from the hotel. We booked a parcel city view room and got a room on the 4th floor not much of a view, all we could see was l the top of the hotel lobby and a few large buildings oh well we didnt spend much time there anyway. Having the Maui Brewery in the hotel was great good food and drinks. The room was clean and well appointed with modern furniture and comfortable bed and pillows. Hot water and fluffy towels. Toiletries were nice and room large and well set out. Reseption staff and service staff very friendly and attentive. Check in and check out easy and fast. Conciege and porters all very helpful and knowledgeable.Lane way next to hotel has a small market place but prices a bit expensive but lane does go through to the next street where there is a lot of restaurants, shops and other stuff. Next door to macys not a large store. Very close to the ABC stores(like a 7eleven) sells everything.A good stay and would definitely recommend.","Western Australia, Australia","wenzzzz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Western Australia, Australia</strong>",138,4.0

What a transformation after a multi-million refurbishment. The rooms are now modern and elegant. Room and bathroom size are still the same but so so much better. The colours used are a sophisticated palette with a beach vibe. The layout of the bathroom area is more functional and appears bigger. Love the tiles used on the floor. Looks like grey wood but is tile. Lots of storage for clothes and baggage. Great size tv above fridge and drawers. Comfy king size bed. Small lounge, table and chair. Lanai/balcony has plenty of room with a table and two chairs. Asked for and got an electric kettle. Much better than the dripolator supplied, for making cups of tea. All staff encountered during the stay, were friendly and helpful. Pool area clean with new lounges and cabanas. Café good for drinks and snacks. Able to access Maui Brewing Company from inside hotel for meals and drinks.Husband's birthday and our 42nd wedding anniversary celebrated during our stay. Thank you for the bottle of bubbles and the chocolates. Lovely surprise.NEGATIVES – 1. Pillows are dreadful. Like logs. Good for support if sitting up in bed watching tv. But awful to sleep on. 2. The lifts are still slow. Excruciatingly slow. Apparently, a new system is being installed at some stage. 3. The new Marketplace shop wasn’t open. Still being worked on. 4. Unable to charge café purchases back to hotel. Cash or credit card only. Don’t like taking cash or cc’s to the pool. A theft waiting to happen. 4. Not enough shade around pool. Only 5 cabanas available. At least 2 more could be accommodated. Some shade cloth over the pergolas would be a great addition. Still leaves plenty of room in full sun for those who wish to bake themselves silly and risk skin cancer. 5. Resort Fees – used nothing except for beach bag. Waste of time and money. Rather get a credit to spend at café or marketplace shop. Or better yet, no resort fees! 6. Changed the brand of toiletries in bathroom. Used to have coconut and lime (my favourite). Am hoping they may stock it when new marketplace shop opens.Negatives aside – it was a great stay. Hotel is fabulous and in a great location. Right across the road from The Cheesecake Factory. Above Macy’s. Shops and restaurants abound nearby. Perfect. Totally recommend. Will stay again.","Newcastle, Australia","nle69</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle, Australia</strong>",237,4.0

We did have similar issues to other reviewers regarding the elevators, air conditioning and shade around the pool ...all of which appear to be addressed by the hotel. Our room was comfortable and quite. Our housekeeper, Anita looked after us and was very welcoming.I was, however, concerned about the amount of single use plastic used. With no glassware available in our room we had the rely on plastic cups which were wrapped in plastic! Such a waste and environmentally unacceptable. Also the lobby area was constantly filled with guests eating takaway food and drinks..something I haven't experienced before staying at an Outrigger hotel.","Sydney, Australia","kate b</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",36,4.0

It was good value, however the breakfast voucher to us was a problem as the Aroma Cafe ware a separate business to the hotel and their food and staff needs some attention. The pool area is nice , but needs to be shaded more, very exposed. The spa is also great. However an outdoor shower and foot washing station needs to be installed as some guests think it’s okay to come straight from the beach with sandy feet and get into the pool and spa, hence they are then dirty and you end up sitting on that sand. The rooms have been beautifully renovated and decorated and the housekeeping staff did a wonderful job servicing our room, could not fault. The only problem with the room is the air conditioning, it seems to have a problem with maintaining temperature and kept cutting in and out(yes we did try setting it at different temps), other guests we chatted with also had some problems with their air-con. I am sure the management will sort out these problems as it has only been recently re-opened and taken over as an Outrigger resort.

It has very close and easy beach access. The hotel was remodeled a few months ago and everything is brand new. The Maui Brewing Company restaurant off from the lobby of the the hotel was absolutely fantastic. Rates are reasonable.I'm giving 4 stars because our one bedroom beachcomber suite on the 22nd floor was very hot and stayed hot for our entire 6 night stay. Beware: There ARE NO air vents into the bedroom part of the suite, only the sitting area. The A/C will come on and run ONLY when the room is occupied, which isn't adequate to get it cooled off before bedtime. We called and had 2 giant fans brought into our room which helped but we did not sleep well at night. The 4 elevators are not up to par with the amount of guests.

Room 1606. Was supposed to be a full ocean view room. To me it was partial ocean view and partial diamond head view - two partials don't make a full. The room was functional. Comfy bed, serviceable but small bathroom, small balcony to watch the goings on in Waikiki. They provided plastic and paper cups for tea and coffee, which is a real turn-off. No wine glasses - had to specifically ask for them. Asked for proper cups as well but apparently they don't have them!! Large wall mounted TV where you could cast Netflix. Latest movies cost $20 US- very expensive. Room tip. We were facing the Diamond Head side. Below us is Macy's. On top of Macy's is a set of large air conditioning systems which are quite loud.

Yes, it was recently remodeled, so relatively nice. It has a more modern tone to it, but it clearly is not where Outrigger is spending their money. You start noticing cracks in drywall, dirt on the stairs, and other things that you just would not expect in a well run hotel - particularly for the money you might spend. Service was acceptable and friendly, but never did I feel anyone went out of their way to make me feel like a real guest.The 4 elevators are notably slow in getting to you. Expect to wait a minute or 2 each time, regardless of congestion. In the 3 days we stayed there, one of them went out of commission at the lobby, twice. As it was stuck at the lobby, no other elevators would come to the floor and we had to take the stairs, which are unfinished concrete, similar to what you would find in a parking garage.The day of check-in, their phone system was down, so we were unable to call in to determine a good time to arrive and had to drive into the city to find out. The lights on one of our bedside tables were dead (fixed fairly quickly by maintenance after a call) and their Chromecast service was out for our entire 3-day stay (apparently for the second time in 2 weeks). Don't worry though! You can watch one of the 8 TV channels, or pay the low-low price of $15-20 for a single movie..or $10/day to listen to music.Parking is Valet only, and they charge you $40/day - which seems typical, if on the slightly higher end of the normal Waikiki pricing. I would complain about them being valet only, but their team in the parking garage is very fast. Overall, I think the only things that this hotel has going for it is a reasonably competitive room price and a decent location. It would certainly not be my first choice, though.","Henderson, Nevada","zodiacvii</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Henderson, Nevada</strong>",4,3.0
