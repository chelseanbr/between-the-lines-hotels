Rooms in tokyo are mostly 11 or 12sq meters and thats a bit small for 2 people with suitcases but this hotel has larger rooms much more pleasant for 2 people. Getting to shinjuku or shibuya from yotsua is very simple i would be happy to return to this hotel again.","Bali, Indonesia","Bryce96budokan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bali, Indonesia</strong>",4,4.0

The staff at checkin were lovely but during my stay found the staff were disinterested. The WiFi was great. Once again only one English Channel on the television, CNN. Come on if you want to host international guests have some more television options. The biggest disappointment was the breakfast. AWFUL does not begin to explain it. It is served in the pizzeria and it is not equipped to do breakfast. Stale bread, cold everything else! This hotel would do well to remove a breakfast offering as it is disgusting!

Easy access into shinjuku and various nice restaurants in surrounding area. Room was very well looked after the breakfast was excellent. Unfortunately reception staff were quite unhelpful when asked for anything outside of check in and check out. Simple services, assistance you would expect at any decent hotel were not recieved well. If they improve customer service and learn to go the extra mile could be a top notch place to stay.","London, United Kingdom","Blackadder83</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",0,4.0

The hotel is in Yotsuya, which is a JR stop from Shinjinku, so it is really close to the action, but nice and relaxed as it is not in the thick of things. It is a few mins walk to the JR station (same side as the hotel - walk and cross the main street and down the driveway to the station) and the Metro station (the Marounouchi line - walk down the opposite side of the road to the hotel and cross the street). The Marounouchi line is the key line that is used - so VERY convenient. We only used the other Metro line (Blue line), which is even closer, as it is the on the same side of the street - we used this to get to the Imperial Palace. Aside from transport - the location is brilliant because of its proximity to:- Restaurants and bars - the alley behind the hotel has loads of bars & restaurants - we went to a number of these restaurants and they were brilliant! - Family Mart, Local supermarket and pharmacies - all across the road using the zebra crossing at the hotel front door. - Coin operated launderette - it is a couple of mins walk from the hotel (out the back door - turn left, then right and look for the orange canopy). You will need 100 yen coins for this.  - Taxis - they just stop out the front - if you flag them, or have one of the front desk team members flag them.The room was great. Small - but not as tiny as some Tokyo hotels - we picked it for this reason. The bed was a Queen size (another rarity in Tokyo), which meant we slept really well. The mattress was super firm and very comfy. There was also a sofa - so we had an alternative to the bed to sit on. Great shower. The breaky is basic - but if you want to fuel up to the day - it does the job. It can get busy (in the small space), but this was only a problem on 1 morning - other days - we always got a seat. The team members on the front desk are helpful and very friendly. One night we got pizza (I know I know . . .we were in Tokyo!), as we just wanted to eat in after a huge day out in the rain . . . we just went down and purchased it, along with a wine from the Family Mart. We got wine glasses bought up to the room from reception and the restaurant provided all cutlery & napkins etc. We stayed for 5 nights and it was great value for money.","Melbourne, Australia","chelseaM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",5,5.0

Check-in was odd and involved a combination of both an automated check-in system and reception staff but we were allowed to check in early, which was very accommodating. The room was relatively spacious for Japanese standards. Beds were large and comfortable. Plenty of cupboard and storage space. Furniture and bathroom looking past their prime, though. All staff very friendly but a special shout-out goes to the cleaning staff who all greet the guests warmly in the mornings if they are around and frequently ran ahead to call the lift for us when they saw us coming.We had an especially good deal for this hotel. If the price is right, it's a great choice. We would definitely stay here again.","Hattingen, Germany","tkminDE</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hattingen, Germany</strong>",30,4.0

The hotel is located just a 5 minute walk from Yotsuya Station which is only a 3min train ride to the famous Shinjuku Train Station.The hotel staff were always smiling and helpful and well spoken in English which made communication a lot easier. The lobby has visitor information booklets and maps. The rooms were small typical of most hotels in Japan. They were clean and housekeeping was done everyday including provision of fresh bathrobes. The best part was the handy amenities bar located opposite the lift which enabled us to use the quality Japanese face products. The hotel also has a restaurant on the ground floor which serves throughout the day including pizzas. The check in/out process was smooth. The room rates were reasonable and the hotel was well located to restaurants, convenience stores ( family mart) and bus/ trains.

I went to Japan with my brothers on a “boys” trip and we stayed at the Hotel Keihan in Yotsuya. I honestly don’t have many gripes with this place, I just found it to be an average hotel. Here’s the quick breakdown:Pros:-Close to Yotsuya Station (2-3 minute walk)-enough room for both of us as most Japanese hotel rooms are cramped. -very friendly staffCons:-bathroom was not my favorite. Bidet was lower tech then most others and didn’t look very clean. Also didn’t care for the faucet in the sink. It’s over sprayed a lot when washing your hands unless you had the water just trickling out. -bed was a little short for a 6 footer.Overall, my real only gripe was with the bathroom. The rest of the experience was fine but nothing special. I would probably stay somewhere else next time, but wouldn’t rule this one out if I had limited options.

Reception counter is equipped with big auto check in / out machine needs hotel staff’s help. It looks like staff are not encouraged to communicate with their guests.2. In the room, there is a phone but no information on numbers to reach reception or any other section. 3. No service directory is available. You should check their website to know what they offer.4. So you need to call land line to reach hotel staff from your room.5. Now, staff look like sometimes-moving-mannequin for my eyes.6. You should know that hotel management doesn’t allow their guests to invite anyone who is not staying in the hotel to your room, even just for a few hours.7. That’s why, I will NEVER come back to this hotel.8. For those who consider this hotel, Tokyu Stay Yotsuya, located opposite to this hotel over main road, seems to be far better according to my friend who stayed there before.

There are many convenience stores & restaurants store too next to the hotel.The room is very clean too & provides 1 bottled mineral water every day.
