The best I can say is that WBH is kind of okay, and does offer a relatively inexpensive place to stay in Waikiki. We had a semi-private room which is a partitioned area inside a larger dorm room. the beds were okay and the sheets and pillow case were crispy clean. Our ""roomies"" just outside were considerately quiet when they came in very late (thank you!). Unfortunately, the whole place has the air of a place slowly falling apart, and no one giving a rip. Staff seems resigned, at best The place was very noisy with party noises going on until late - not unexpected with young traveling crowd, and not a problem for us (...ironically, when we went out for breakfast the next day we were greeted with the sight of our old guy neighbor outside in only his droopy white BVDs, sigh...not really a problem, but not really appropriate either). Our room had a small deck with sliding door, but just across was a loud drinking party, so we needed to keep the door closed, which made the room very hot. the air conditioner literally roared, so we turned it off. Slatted curtains over slider door were filthy and were also useless, as all but four slats had broken off. Room was dirty - weird stuff (euuww...) had run down and sort of coagulated on one wall and not been washed off. there was a lamp, but cord was unplugged and wrapped around lamp base. Corners and edges of floor were deeply dirty. Door was dirty and blackish around knob area and edges. Bathroom tiles were grimy. outside walkways were also dirty. My feeling is that the place gets ""cleaned"" but not with any efforts to actually clean things. Did not even want to experience ""breakfast"" here, so walked around the corner to nearby Denny's. We are not picky people, and not looking for luxury, but this place just looks like no one cares, and mostly just do the minimum. However...gotta say the location is great. We were returning from several weeks of low-budget ""third world"" travels- our most expensive place cost less than 1/2 of WBH and each place was extremely clean with evident pride of ownership. The contrast between these places and the very slovenly aspects of WBH was glaring. I'm giving my first ever poor review because the issues I raised could all be addressed with a little effort.",,Alisalani1,2,2.0

Danny at front was extremely hospitable, and communication was great via email until they eventually got me in a female dorm that covered my entire 12 days in Hawaii. People say the room is what you pay for, it is modest in terms of facility but it is fine but the location right by the Waikiki is on point and very convenient to plan your trip.Every Wednesday, there is a free tour around the east coast of the island that is affiliated with the hostel. I was noticed that there is one free spot left last minute and decided to join on a whim- which is one of the best decisions during my vacation! You can visit multiple local places around the island that is not accessible with public transportation, and the 5 hour tour covers all the major must-see visits- Hanauma Bay, Spitting Cave, Hanola Blowhole, Makapu Point. Ryan is the most experienced and professional guides you can see in Hawaii.

Usually you would give a deposit and when you bring the towel back you get your money back. Well here they sell the towels for 4$ and on too of that it's really bad quality.No personnal lights at the bed... kind of sucks if someone needs the light but the other person is sleeping. Not convenient at all. Saturday tour (organised by the hostel) leaves at 9 and breakfast starts at 9... went there at 8:45 to grab a toast before the road, the ladies making the breakfast refused to serve me.. the toasts were ready, the jam was on the table... it's a self serve process... i don't know what is the big deal to open it 10 min before, especially when they are the one who organised the tour at 9amThe breakfast is from 9-10am which is way too late. All other hostels serve their breakfast before that. I only had breakfast there like twice during the whole week because I wake up at 7, wanting to enjoy my day and not waste time, so can't wait until 9 am for a couple of toasts.As other people have mentionned, there are no blankets. I went in July so no need for a blanket, but in the colder season you definetely need a small blanket...They offer a tour for a discounted price but there is only one tour. The full island tour on Saturdays and a half day tour on Wednesdays. I noticed that other hostels offer different discounted tours every day.Pros:The location is great you can walk to restaurants, shops, beach, etc. Only 10 min drive to Diamond Head. The island tour on Saturday is only 35$ when on the streets they try to sell it to you for 85-120$. It's totally worth doing the tour with the hostel. Book your spot asap. They also offer a half day tour on Wednesdays, for free.They clean the bathroom every day. For a hostel, it has everything you need for a couple of nights. The staff is very nice and helpful.

There were 2 bunk beds in the front room and 2 bunk beds in the back room with a bathroom for 8 girls but that worked out ok.

Mine luckily had a large fridge and clean microwave. - though I didn’t use it, laundry was cheap ($1-3USD)Cons:- pictures didn’t match in booking.com, makes it look lovely but these are only the top tier rooms (I presume)- cleanliness was poor. Housekeeper did attend daily though only for a quick wipe down of the floor and remove trash. Bathrooms could be improved greatly. There was hair left over. Showers were poor pressure, and no hand wash provided, not even a bar of soap. - during my 4 day stay there were multiple smoke detectors running low battery that beeped every 2 seconds literally. I asked reception to investigate and change but they left them to beep for days. Yes, days. Sleep was terribly interrupted. - “breakfast” is toast with a choice of peanut butter or jam/jelly. Water and drip coffee provided and only served for one hour (9-10am), not a minute before or after. Gluten free or celiacs nightmare. - the communal area is outdoors so there isn’t even a place indoors to hide from cooler weather. This is also the ONLY place to get wifi.

By far the most comfortable accommodation is the four-person space. There's a bedroom (more or less private) and two twin beds in a kitchen-like area. The bathroom is shared by all. My suitemates were a mostly silent young woman in a coat and long pants who'd fall asleep with her music playing, a visitor from France who's self-employed and has come to Hawaii five times in 2018, and ... the mystery woman, who found herself a BF and returns to the hostel to change clothing. In that room, someone had brought in a dispenser bottle of hand soap for the bathroom (yay!) and there was dish soap provided by the kitchen sink.My first night on the return was in an eight-person dorm, and it was untenable. I moved the mattress from the upper bunk to the kitchen floor (can't climb up and down). There was no place to set things other than to pile your luggage on the floor. (I've stayed in much more well-planned hostels where there are drawers under the lower beds, shelves with charging stations and reading lamps for every bed.) The three young women already in the room had used every inch of space: clothing and swimsuits hanging off the bunk frames, cosmetics and belongings from one end of the dresser to the other.) I checked with the front desk, and was moved to a ""co-ed"" room with four beds. The private room was used by a young couple, and my roommate was a very pleasant young man visiting from Germany. He was a delight to talk with; best conversations of my four-day stay. This room was also the cleanest and most nicely appointed -- decorative tiles in the bathroom, extra space to set belongings. While there is a very large public area, with various set-ups for lounging and visiting, I found it difficult to find a good discussion. Everyone seemed to be glued to their phones. There was a small gathering near the large TV watching the surfing championships. Since I was up and on the beach by 8 am every day, I never partook of the free breakfast (coffee, toast, peanut butter, oatmeal). None of the three rooms I sampled had the sort of total darkness that I am accustomed to. In the kitchen mattress space, I discovered that I was sleeping in front of an uncovered window. That room was also the most noisy in the early morning, with delivery and collection trucks driving on Lemon Street right beneath the windows.Having typed all that...I would stay again. The property is almost right on the beach, and there are many amenities practically at the doorstep. (I became a habitue of Starbucks-on-the-sand, all four mornings.) When my trip plans changed, they had space for me, and the on-line reservation system worked for booking. There are several Biki bikeshare stations very close. The staff ranged from helpful to very friendly, and the rooms are cleaned daily. You can't lose the key: it's a digital wristband that works on your own door. Did I mention how close the beach is?

There are also public busses and excursion busses that leave from Waikiki to other parts of the island.Staff are very knowledgeable and polite. I also got very nice roommates that were easy to get along with (although one did turn on the light to read at 4PM some mornings). I hung out and did stuff with them part of the time and then did stuff on my own as well. I also was put on the fourth floor and there was no elevator but walking up and down all those stairs provided me a much needed workout and they staff said they can put people who don't want to do that much climbing on the 2nd floor instead.My own complaint is about the locker needing a quarter each time you want to put your stuff in to take out the key but there is a change machine in the lobby.

Don't bother with the breakfast - there is a great juice/sandwich spot just a couple blocks down toward the beach that is worth your time. I still have a bit of the backpacker spirit in me, but wouldn't recommend the shared rooms to anyone that can afford better.","Anchorage, Alaska","Jonathan P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anchorage, Alaska</strong>",27,2.0

The hostel is located very close to the beach. It's like a three minutes walk from there. The rooms are pretty clean because the friendly staff takes care about them every day. Unfortunately there are still cockroaches running through the room. Two things really annoyed me: The wifi and the lockers. At the wifi I got kicked out every couple of seconds, it's absolutely no fun to use it like this. So if you plan to video call somebody, this is definitely not the place to be. The bad thing about the lockers is, you get charged a quarter dollar for every use. You can't just use your padlock like in every other well equipped hostel in the world. A quarter dollar doesn't seem to be much, but well, you have to pay every time you lock the door, so you really have to think about, if you got everything in or if you need anything out before closing the door. I don't understand why the hostel accepts that guests may get robbed because they just prefer to refrain locking their stuff to safe their change. ",,Manuel M,4,3.0

That being said, I wasn't too sure on what to expect during my 8 night stay.For me, check-in was quick and I was given a couple sheets and instructed to find a bed in my room and place my confirmation sheet on the clipboard at the end of the bed. So I located a bed, verified with the front desk that the person on the old confirmation sheet was no longer there, and made up the bed leaving my bag on top. Later, I came back on find my bag had been moved and someone sleeping in that bed. He didn't speak English so, that was a loss for me. That put me on the top bunk right in front of the small wall AC unit in the back room (the front room beds had to deal with the downstairs noise). I slept with ear plugs to muffle the noise. The unit also made it too cold for me to sleep...so I blocked most of the air with my backpack...but at least the room still had some cooling.The room was messier than I expected to find. There was stuff, clothes, suit cases here and there...but usually around a bed. The refrigerator (old) was about the same...impossible to tell what food belonged to who. The floor looked dirty (it was) and the bathroom was also pretty messy (at the end of the day, I guess that is what it should look like after guests are hitting the beach and then returning to clean up). It almost appeared as though there was no housekeeping services...but I later saw that there was a daily service. So apparently, we were messing up the place that quick! There are lockers in the room (takes US quarters only), but only one worked as the other 3 had foreign coins jammed in them. I was on the 4th floor so the free WiFi wasn't very good due to range. The bathroom definitely needed to be renovated. So these were a few negatives for me.There's no smoking anywhere on the property per a local law. But a couple of my roommates went on the patio any way to smoke...one of the other roommates complained to the front desk. They put up no smoking signs all over the hostel including inside our room.I had a rental car so I was really popular with my roommates. I parked on the street and usually had to walk a little ways for free parking. But never too far (at least for a jogger).You are located just a block from the beach and the Honolulu zoo. Also, this place is located at the end of the ""tourist strip"" of stores and restaurants....so walk up one side of the street as far as you wanted...then back on the other side. So these are definite pluses to picking this hostel.I did a short 5 mile jog around Diamond Head every day...usually in the morning, but a couple runs were in the afternoon. Going clockwise, I was in city for the first couple miles...but the second half was all along the ocean side where there was some awesome views. This again is another plus in my book.Now the water coming out of both the kitchen and bathroom faucets had a foul smell too it. To me, it smelled like something rotten or dead. I dreaded brushing my teeth..yuck! I mentioned this to the front desk and the hostel manager said he looked into it, but didn't notice it. So on check out, we both checked it out together. He agreed there was a weird smell to the water coming out of the bathroom faucet. So this is a negative to this place. I have no idea if anything was actually done to resolve this but suspect some effort was made based.There are only 3 washing machines and 4 dryers (US $1 each). When I went to use them, the housekeeping staff were using all but one of each. Why aren't they using the hostel industrial washers/dryers?...I later found out they don't have any. The rule is they leave at least one washer and one dryer open at all times. That is good in theory, but if more than one guest wants to do clothes at the same time, it doesn't work. So this was a negative.Breakfast: toast, coffee, water, peanut butter & jelly...no juice. I don't usually eat breakfast so I this goes down as a neutral rating cause I couldn't honestly rate a free breakfast...if that is what it really is.There's a big screen TV down stairs and some charging stations. Lots of people would hang out here depending on the time of day. I met people of all ages from everywhere around the world here. So overall, I don't know how to rate this place..compared to a hotel, it wasn't even close...but it's not supposed to be...you're sharing! I asked a lot of the other wayward travelers staying at this hostel how it compared to others they've stayed at...most said it was about average. Some have had better and some had stayed at much worse. So overall, I feel the place was a little run down and needs some updating. But it is manageable. The price is tough to beat. It's been years since I last visited Oahu..I was extremely disappointed in what I found due to growth and tourism. I probably won't ever be back to this island for vacation...that being said, it is not because of this hostel.Best advice I can offer on this place, is to reference other reviews for advice on this place as I just don't feel I know enough about hostels to give an accurate review.","Oxnard, California","Kitman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oxnard, California</strong>",104,3.0

If all you're looking for is a cheaper hostel in good location, where you can put your bags and sleep at night, then go for it. But don't expect much here and you won't be disappointed. Rooms are somewhat clean, but in poor condition. When we arrived we checked into our room which hadn't been cleaned yet so that was a pretty bad effort by the staff. Staff are average to say the least. The job sort of gets done eventually, e.g checking is into a room which hadn't been cleaned then we had to wait while they cleaned it.The beds are very average, our doors and windows had holes in the mosquito nets and the air conditioner barely worked. The kitchen in the room had a stove and fridge but no cooking utensils or pots and pans etc... so the kitchen was a waste of space. The water was hot in the shower, that was a bonus.

The rooms are previous 1BR / 1BA / 1 living room apartments. The bedroom in mine was converted to a semi-private room with a small AC. The living room which is by the door and kitchenette had two single beds very close to each about (about 2 feet) which made it a little awkward with a male and a female that close. The beds were very squeaky, not the bed itself but the frame would move on the floor metal on tile every time you moved much. The bed was not very comfortable, thin. You only get two thin sheets and a pillow cover - but since it's so hot that's all you need.There is a box fan in the room, only one fan for the room. It is very hot, even in October. It would be better if there were two fans so each person could have a fan blowing on them (there isn't a way to angle the fan to get it hitting both people. The kitchenette was a surprise, with a full refrigerator, oven/stove, sink, microwave, and some dishware.As others said, the lockers cost 25 cents each time.The room wasn't in very good repair. There were small ants that would roam the kitchen several times. The bathroom had a bunch of mold behind the sink. The shower was a little grungy.Breakfast is just toast, peanut butter and jelly, tap water, coffee (pretty good), and hot water for basic tea bags. It's only 9-10 am which means if you start the day any earlier you’ll miss it anyway. They don’t give you plates at breakfast, which isn’t good for a messy sandwich. Bring a plate from your room if you have one.It wasn’t too loud when I was there except for two of the seven nights when inconsiderate guests were loud in the lobby past the 10pm quiet hours. I called the desk and they said they would handle it, but nothing happened so am not sure they really cared.The only thing really good about the hotel is the location and the price. If that’s most important to you and you aren’t expecting a nice place, then this is your place. The bus stop is just a block away and I didn’t have to connect too many times. You are walking distance to the free Kuhio Beach and free hula shows on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at 6:30.

The beds are firm enough to sleep on. You get a set of sheets to lay on your bed from the front desk. Housekeeping is punctual. It is not noisy at night as there is a noise curfew at 10 PM. A scooter/moped rental place is attached to the hostel for convenience. Local residents are discouraged by asking for an onward travel reservation, this keeps the hostel trouble free. The airport shuttles recognize the address. Breakfast is free, but it only consists of PBJ sandwiches and coffee. Residents are friendly and it is a good option to save money if you are travelling alone. Waikiki hotels are pretty expensive. The main shopping area of Waikiki is a short 10 to 15 minute walk away.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Sundncr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",256,5.0

We had a full sized refrigerator and microwave. This meant we could buy local produce and prepare food during workshop breaks. We could eat late at night when restaurants were closed. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Coffee and toast at 9:00 a.m. come with the room and the laundry area is easily accessible. It was clean and housekeeping staff came in daily. This is may be a no frills stay, but it is well worth the daily rate and perks. It is only a couple of short blocks from the beach. (Just bring your ear plugs if you are sensitive to early morning urban noise.) In just a few minutes walk and you'll be at the beach, shops (if that's your interest), restaurants, and public transportation is easy here. We would recommend this hostel.","Denver, Colorado","M S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",2,4.0

I stayed in an 8 bed mixed dorm both times. The 8 bed dorms are split into 2 rooms with 2 sets of bunks in each. It is well priced for a great location (5 min walk to the beach), the rooms are neat and tidy and cleaned every day. You get a waterproof wristband which is your key so you never have to worry about forgetting or losing it! There is a deposit for this but you get it back when you return the key. It is also close to bus stops to get to Diamond Head or Pearl Harbor. Walking distance to convenience stores and supermarket. I really enjoyed my stay here. The front desk staff were really helpful and cheerful. Linen is included in the proce and is clean and pressed. Lockers are 25 cents per use. There are plenty of social activities and free breakfast every morning! They also do surfboard hire and have a bunch of floaty rings and beds for the beach. There is also a scooter/moped rental place next door. The rooms I stayed in had a kitchen but I also know there are some without. If you are a light sleeper I would recommend earplugs and an eye mask because of the noise and sometimes there are trucks on the street early in the morning. If you rent a car there is on site parking but spaces are limited and there is a fee. There are a lot of stairs if you are on one of the higher levels so pack light!

My friend and I stayed in a shared room with 2 other travellers (we had a semi-private). I would never book at this hostel again just because it was quite dirty and not maintained at all. No one came to clean the rooms and by the time we got there, other travellers have left the room and the bathroom as it was. We were given our own sheets to make our bed and then return it once we left.Even with the semi-private room, we had to walk across the living room where there were two other beds for the two backpackers who were quite friendly and cool. We ended up hanging out with them! This place is great for meeting other travellers, but definitely not if you want to properly sleep or feel clean...We also got to see the dorms and met other travellers- I was so lucky that I didn't book a dorm because it seemed horrendously gross! Backpackers' stuff everywhere on the floor; I don't know how no one would be worried about their belongings. The dorm smelled and was just like a bunch of college students' afterparty. Not the hostel's fault, but seems like they don't really enforce any rules or look after their rooms as much. The staff didn't really do much - check in and check out was simple, fast, and easy. The BEST thing about this hostel was the perfect and central location! It was just a step away from the beach and we went out several nights and walked back home around 3am/4am and was all fine. Everything was at a wonderful distance to go and explore. Even catching a LYFT/UBER, or the bus to Ala Moana was cheap. If you want to save money (even though this place is really expensive for the quality!!! BUT everywhere in Waikiki will be exorbitant, even the horrible ones), meet other travellers, party, this is the place for you.

The stay in hostel was overall a good experience, especially for the price and location. I booked a bed in the 4-bed female dorm. 2 beds are in the semi-private room which has access to a small balcony. The private room doesn't seem to have a door. My bed is one of the two beds outside in the kitchen area. My roommates were quiet and considerate, besides, none of us cooked so it was quiet enough to sleep at night...well, most nights. The last night there was a fight/argument in the other building, and the noise lasted hours in the early morning, until after someone pulled the fire alarm. It was my last night there so I didn't even bother to complain. I just wanted to sleep for as much as I can and leave the next morning. I don't remember the room having A/C, or maybe I didn't pay attention. I traveled in mid-late April and the temperature was perfect. I didn't find the need for A/C. pros: - Great location, close to everything. 5 minute walk from Waikiki Beach and bus stops, surrounded by plenty of restaurants, bars, and of course the famous ABC convenient stores. The area seems to be safe. - Price: You just can't beat that price for a location like this. - The fun - I became friends with two of my roommates. We did some exploration and activities together in Hawaii. One of them even came visit me in my city a few months after the Hawaii trip!- Staff at the front desk was friendly and helpful. - My room was on the second floor, above the reception area, and wifi was strongCons: - Cleanliness. When I arrived the first night, I found huge (I mean huge) brown stains on both of my pillowcases. I was grossed out, but since it was my first experience staying at a hostel, I wasn't sure if this is considered ""common"", and I was very tired after a long flight, so I slept on it that night. The next day I bumped into the cleaning lady and asked for a clean pair. She looked apologetic when she saw the dirty pillowcases. I am not sure if they have just forgotten to change my sheets before I arrived or what. - No place to hang clothes or towels. There are 1-2 hooks behind the bathroom door, but outside the bathroom there are no place for guests to hang their damp towel or clothes. Even tough I kinda came ""prepared"" and brought two clothes hangers, there was no where to hang them. I eventually hung them on the metal bar on my bed. I found this very inconvenient. I mean, no one wants to put wet towels and bikinis on their beds. And how much does it cost to put some some plastic or metal hooks on the wall? Like 2 dollars? This is a cheap and quick improvement the management could have done, and it would have provided so much more comfort and convenience to their guests.- Leak problem in the shower. In our room whenever someone showered, the water would leak from somewhere on the bottom of the tub and the floor would be all wet and slippery. The one tiny towel on the bathroom floor isn't enough to soak up that much water, so we have wet slippery floor all the time. It's dirty and could be dangerous. My tips for staying at this hostel: 1. Bring two towels, or buy two at the front desk. One for the shower and another for the beach. 2. Bring 1-2 clothes hangers. You'll need it to hang your wet towel or bikini, but good luck finding a place to hang them. 3. The in-room locker cost 25 cents per use -- every time you take out someone from the locker, you'll need to pay again to lock it. If you want to save a few bucks, only lock the valuables that you don't use during your stay, such as your passport, extra cash, etc. During my stay I put these in the locker in my first night and retrieved them the day I left. 4. If you are a female, it's worth paying a little bit more for the 4-bed female dorm. The beds in the kitchen don't cost that much more anyway. You'll feel safer and more relaxed compared with staying in a mixed dorm with 6-8 other people. 5. If you rent a car, which I did for one day, you can park at one of their two on-site parking lots. But be sure to reserve a space at the front desk in advance, since there are only a few spaces. The cost is approximately $10/day (can't remember exactly). The conclusion: If I travel solo again to Honolulu, I'd consider staying at this hostel again. If I travel with someone else, it may be better to stay at a lower end hotel and split the cost.",,Em C,2,3.0

We booked a private room but for a week but had to stay in the all female dorm the first night because the private wasn't available.

Hostels are budgets accommodations, if you want 4 star or 3 or even 2 star service book a 2,3,4, star hotel and pay the price. Or call and ask questions before booking.Also I am writing this 6 month after stay Mar 2015 so I am focusing on most basics that shouldn't have changed. Staff was ok though they may have changed. The locations is ok for Beach, zoo, but you'll need bus or car to get to most other attractions. Fortunately bus stop 1 -2 blocks away. There is also a strange small car rental next door.There are 3 ABC Stores nearby for quick food and souvenir items and 3 blocks of shopping mostly major chains with some independent types, also same with restaurants.I will say this is the first hostel I stayed in that had a full size fridge and 4 burner stove in the room. I don't know if all have this so ask. but that is why room got above average. It was an 8 bunk mixed dorm booking but two rooms with 4 bunk in each made it less crowded. 1 full bath for all 8 bunks, but wasn't a problem.neat wristband key made I a little less likely to lose.Breakfast was simple with peanut butter and jelly no juice or milk so if this is important to you ask if it's changed.

It was really good. It is really close to the beach, perfect to go take a walk, however you can't see the beach from there because of other buildings. They don't allow to smoke in the room which is good. And they rent stuff to bring to the beach like surf boards, body bords and even snorkel. The rooms have six beds and we were in 5 so there was always a person that we don't know there which was good because we could get to know new people but if you don't feel safe they have lockers inside the room. The key to get in the room is a wristband that can get wet, so very convenient since you can't lose it, it is always on you. You get a kit of bed sheets upon your arival and they dont change until you get out of there, if you want they have a laundry there to wash it for some coins. We could park the car there too for some bucks but I don't remember how much was it. And to finish, it was a really good experience, you don't need to care much for a room in Hawaii you stay all day out of it visiting the beaches so this hostel was a cheaper choice.","Fortaleza, CE","YanReis</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fortaleza, CE</strong>",15,4.0

So instead of trying to compare it, I'll go over what to expect.I stayed in a 4 bed room, along with 3 roommates. The place was extremely bare, with only the minimum furniture, although it did have a mini kitchen. There were almost no amenities - no soap, no towels, etc. In fact, they were even out of the towels that they sell at the front desk. At check in, I was given some pillows that I had to carry to my room. There is activity in the main area 24/7, so expect a good amount of noise throughout the night. The bottom line is that you are getting a lot less than a hotel, but for only $30ish a night, that trade off was well worth it.

I would say the hostel was clean but starting to look worn down, like a cheap motel. My partner and I stayed in a semi private room, which meant that we had a closed off room from a 2 bedroom dorm that was also the kitchen, making cooking meals a bit awkward since we were basically in their bedroom. We had good access to wi fi and a TV in our own bedroom. The four of us shared a bathroom, which is pretty good for a communal hostel where usually there are a lot more people sharing bathrooms. Although the staff was friendly, I was disappointed in the lack of recommendations of things to do from the staff – they really didn't seem to know what was going on in town and suggested instead that I look online. They do not plan events for the guests, which for a hostel, seemed very odd to me to not provide opportunities to get to know the city/other travellers.

A great location, right at the hearth of things at the beachfront. It is a hostel, and not a hotel, and you do get what you pay for. However, rooms were regularly cleaned and front desk were both efficient and informative. A special word of thanks to Chris and Yonni on the front desk. Chris for assisting my booking, and Yonni for his genuine friendship during my stay, and invaluable advice on dealing with jet lag. Met some great people there, and we went on a number of excursions together including Stand Up Paddle Boarding ( SUP). I stayed in the four room dorm, with two single beds in the front room, and two in the private room. Not suitable for everyone, and a lot depends on your roommates. In my case, I was lucky with a great disparate group from Switzerland, Michigan, Montreal, Calgary, Japan and England.

I learned that the parking was not guaranteed (something not mentioned when booking), so I had a rental car and nowhere to park it. Little did I know my visions of driving around all night for lack of parking would be better than the actual room. The room was semi-private, meaning we had to walk through a cesspool of filth to get to the locked door. Once in the room, I was reluctant to touch the beds or pillows. The sliding door to the lanai was broken, so there was no way to close or lock it. I never slept that night because people were playing loud music outside all night and the two people sharing our semi-private room partied loudly until about 5am.

I've already recommended it to others and I can't wait to return!!! :)Check-in was good/straightforward, all of the staff at the front desk were so helpful & friendly! :) I particularly liked that the room/entry key is a light blue silicone wristband, it worked great, it is waterproof & was so comfy to wear - I never took it off for my entire stay. SO much better/cooler option than keys &/or cards!I reserved/stayed 4 nights in a Female 4 bed Dorm and I LOVED the option to have a single bed instead of a bunk. I seriously wish every hostel had this option!!!Our dorm had 2 'rooms' & a bathroom (with shower). The first room when you enter (which I stayed in) had 2 single beds. Note: both my bed & pillow were comfortable. I dislike carpet so I liked that we had tile floors. There was a ceiling fan above the beds (which did a remarkably good job circulating the air, it was so comfortable at night with just a sheet) and also there was a spare fan stashed above the fridge too. Between the 2 beds was a night stand w/a lamp. There was a basic, clean open kitchen along one wall with a fridge/stove/sink/microwave/lots of cupboard space, a small round table & 2 chairs. One bed was next to a long dresser below the wall/window(beside the door/entry) the other bed was along a wall that divided the 2nd bedroom which had the other 2 beds dresser and patiodoors (which led to a small lanai). There was also a closet by the washroom that has 4 small-med coin lockers (25cents per use) I roughly estimate they'd hold approx an average school backpack.The rooms were cleaned every afternoon and I was REALLY impressed with the housekeeping staff who did such a great job! NO bugs & it was by far the cleanest hostel of the 4 hostels I've stayed at in Oahu!!! Also, kudos to my roomies who were all friendly, thoughtful & conscientious - which really added to the experience! :)On the ground floor there is a open area with vending machines, a tv & seating where hostellers can hang out and the hostel provides comp coffee, bread/toast with pb&j every morning between 9-10am. The hostel staff are diligent at politely making an announcement reminding guests to be aware/considerate of quiet time (usually at around 10pm). Note: I've stayed in a variety of hotels & hostels all over Waikiki and it's a fairly noisy city (I've found that there is a lot of traffic noise, late night party-ers and early morning delivery/garbage truck noise to be expected anywhere in Waikiki) but our room was substantially quieter than I'd anticipated.Around the corner from that common space is a coin laundry area.WISHLIST: To make this place even better I might recommend:1-some shelving &/or towel rack + hooks in the bathroom or closet-y area... because there was nowhere to hang towels (or swimwear) and its Waikiki so almost everybody has been at the beach! (Also, FYI not a huge issue for me but on the topic of towels, the website mentioned towels sold at front desk but I got the impression that they are are not typically available...so if you didn't pack one, they are $12-25-ish range at any ABC or a little cheaper yet at a Ross or Walmart. (Or if you spend $75 @ rip curl I've found they often have promo towels for $15.))2- ok this is me being kinda OCD/nit-picky (because our room really was great) but there was an odd amount of pily dusty linty stuff all over the ceiling in our room (around/above the ceiling fan) i'm thinking a swiffer(floor thingy) might take care of that easy peasy?Just outside of/beside the entrance there is a lil cafe attached which has breakfast, lunch & dinner items for super reasonable prices. (There was a flyer on our fridge which was super helpful - thanks!)There also is a bike/scooter rental place (I never used) but if you need one its super handy.PS: If you've never been to Hawaii there are incredibly convenient ""ABC stores"" on atleast EVERY BLOCK in Waikiki - they have pretty decent prices for almost everything you might need in a pinch - from bottled water(typical 99cent deal for 1.5L is pretty standard) sunblock, cold meds, towels, postcards, souvenirs, snacks, juice/pop/beer/wine/liquor. (If you save your receipts they offer a promo deal your cashier can tell you about.) If you think ABC is too pricey or want bigger selection there is a Safeway on Kapahulu a Ross on Seaside or a Longs Drugs in the awesome AlaMoana Center(my fav mall ever) and a few blocks from that a Walmart & Sam's Club and another Ross. Oahu also has more than one Costco.Also, around the corner from the hostel on Kapahulu there is a restaurant I think is called Teddy's burgers - I've heard from several ppl that it was good.

We all shared one bathroom which was fine and there were lockers in the room-you just need a quarter to operate them. Towels were available very cheaply indeed! They give you your sheets at reception to make your own bed so you know it's been freshly made up. Full kitchen facilities in the room were a bonus! When I needed to check out and leave my bags, they had a very secure system for this. The only downside was for the guys in the main room having no aircon-it got very hot in there and was also quite noisy but I was happy in my room, especially at that price.

To put it in plain language, I basically spent most of my money on the air tickets (from Indiana) and concert tickets (2 nights). Hence, when I was looking for a lodging, I was hoping for something cheap and decent enough.Price wise, this is not too bad in terms of value for money. I chose the option of having a semi-private room. Semi-private in the sense that it is a room (with a locked door) within a room and the bathroom is shared with the other occupants in the room. The semi-private room is not sorted by gender so I have two male room-mates who shared the main room while I have my private room. The room: Two beds, a large screen TV and air-conditioner (thank goodness!). The mattress are not really in the best condition but I figured for the price I paid, what do I expect. In addition, once I made the bed with the fresh sheets provided, it is good enough. The air-conditioner is a great help in combating the Hawaii heat. The bathroom: This is my biggest sore point. It is clean but just barely. The water pressure is weak and thus difficult to take a shower. At least there is hot water, the saving grace for the bathroom situation. Location: This is a strength of the hostel. The location is great! walking distance to the beach, with plenty of shops and food places nearby. Overall: Will I stay there again? Most likely not unless I am heading to Hawaii again on a super limited budget.","West Lafayette, Indiana","julianatay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Lafayette, Indiana</strong>",56,3.0

Overall - great first experience in Hawaii. Met some really great people. We paid $330 (together!) for the 8-bedroom dorm, which is super cheap considering the location.DORMS - we stayed at the 8-bedroom girls' dorms. It's divided into sort of two rooms with no door, and we stayed at the room with the AC set to 60 degrees (like 15 degrees C). It still got hot, especially in the other room.There's a kitchen in every room, but not extremely well equipped (brand new stove + fridge and such, but not much silverware and plates etc).The dorms are not cleaned daily I believe, not super duper clean but not too horrible.STAFF - super friendly, super helpful! We loved talking to them and getting to know more about the island. The staff is the best asset of the hostel.LOCATION - 3 minute walk from the beach and all the restaurants. Take in consideration Waikiki is SUPER touristy - it's not the ""real"" Hawaiian experience. However, there are bus stops very close to the hostel which will take you anywhere on the island (including trails, hikes, beaches, etc). Kinda safe to walk at night. Very close to all the bars and clubs around the Waikiki strip. MISC - free ""breakfast"" is toast, PB&J and coffee. There's a sort of a lounge/hang out place downstairs where you can meet people and drink and chill. There was a lot of noise coming from the building next door, which too us wasn't a bother but it might be for some people.

Its literally a 2 minute walk from the beach and about 10/15 minutes walk from the main shopping area. Out of the hostels that were down the same road i definitely say this one was the better choice. My favourite things about staying here are that if you chose a small dorm there would only be 4 people in the room and you get a single bed and if your lucky you will be in the other half of a semi private room. The shower and bathroom facilities are good and there is a small kitchen with an oven, stove and fridge. I ended up in an 8 bed dorm and hated it only because the girls that were in the dorm were messy and left the bathroom in a state. However i complained and i was moved to a 4 bed dorm for slightly more money but it was definitely worth it. Downstairs there is parking and also a large communal area.My biggest criticism is that the rooms get very hot and that there should be air con in each room, i would even go as far as paying extra to stay here just for air con.

The Waikiki beach is totally in the walking distance, and that beachfront road, Kalakaua Ave., is totally alive at night with tons of shops, places to eat, torches lit with flames dancing in the wind (especially very nice ones flanking the Duke statue). If you're looking for nice and cheap fast food, go to McDonald's on Kalakaua not far at all from the hostel, but not Burger King nearby which charged a lot more for the similar food. There are also quite a few ABC grocery stores near the hostel where you can get everything from toiletries to bananas to postcards for souvenir.If you're doing an early morning tour of Pearl Harbor, Queen Kapiolani Hotel is where you would want to wait at for your Discovery or something tour bus, and that big hotel is just at the end of the back lane of the hostel and on the left. The bus stops to and from the Airport are also in the walking distance from the hostel (I dragged my suitcase from the arriving bus stop to the hostel and then back to the departing bus stop to the Airport).The Wi-Fi was excellent. The only thing maybe they could improve on was providing towels and small bars of soap and shampoo even at a price. I actually bought a towel from them for a dollar or two, but I had to go to an ABC store for soap.It is definitely recommended for budget travellers who can do shared accommodation and without a TV but you will get to enjoy all that Waikiki beachfront has to offer for a fraction of what people at big hotels pay. Last but not least, the staff were very friendly as well, the gentleman at check-in had a friendly smile and the gentleman at check-out very kindly helped me with storing my bags at their storage since I could not take them with me on a Pearl Harbor tour before leaving the Island.","Coquitlam, Canada","Myo M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coquitlam, Canada</strong>",531,4.0

Waikiki Beachside Hostel was a pleasant surprise. It was inexpensive, but clean. Decor is dated and dingy which makes you think it's dirty. However, upon closer inspection it's not. My two travel companions and I shared a 4 person dorm room. The young lady from Hungary who shared our space was hardly there, was quiet and did her own thing. No conflicts or weird vibes. I think this hostel is a perfect solution for short-term, budget-conscious travelers/visitors to Waikiki. Oh, did I mention the free wi-fi and all-you-can-eat toast? High-end hotel I'm staying at now doesn't offer either (daily wi-fi charges and no breakfast of any kind unless purchased in hoidy-toidy restaurant).This seems quirky, but breakfast under the building's overhang was quite relaxing and delightful. I had fun making pbj sandwiches or filling up on toast and jam before heading out for the day. If I return to HONOLULU I will definitely stay there again. A two-minute walk to central beach area and shops is by far the greatest part of this place. I concur with R00m402's reviewVictoriaDenver, CO",,Victoria A,4,4.0

What a WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE! The Waikiki Beachside Hostel is just one road back from the beach and right beside a beautiful park, the zoo (no odors) and the aquarium. Diamond Head is in plain view as you walk out the hostel's front door, and a very affordable restaurant ($3-$4 for breakfast or lunch or dinner) is right beside the hostel. What more could you ask for at such a reasonable price in Honolulu! This was my 5th trip to Honolulu but my first time at the Waikiki Beachside Hostel. My travel mate and I rented two single beds in the front half of the hotel room - just inside the front door - while two other folks rented the private bedroom in the back half of the room. Our hostel room had a full sized kitchen - 4 burner free-standing stove/oven, microwave, full sized refrigerator, sink w/disposal unit, art work on walls, telephone in room w/no charge for local calls, huge shower, sink, and bathroom mirror outlined in lights! Guess what...EVERYTHING WORKED and all of what I just mentioned is in EVERY ROOM, regardless of what type of room you're renting!! Room was cleaned everyday. Huge screen tv on ground level common area w/complimentary toast/coffee/peanut butter & jelly everyday from 9a-10a. EXTREMELY helpful staff and at SUCH A LOW PRICE in HONOLULU!! Very ""ALOHA"" experience. But here's the BEST news: Three of my previous 5 stays I spent at the other Lemon Rd. hostel just a few doors down from Waikiki Beachside Hostel - that hostel has the word ""Polynesian"" in it's title. You know what I got when I stayed at their place for the SAME PRICE?? A barren/empty room with two sets of bunk beds in it and NOTHING else - no furniture in room...no private kitchen in room...no art work in the room...no telephone in the room. A light bulb hanging from an electrical wire from the ceiling. A shower stall with dead bugs in the shower EVERY DAY! Broken/burnt out light bulbs in the bathroom that were never replaced. So do the math. For the SAME PRICE, why stay in a dump like the Polynesian Youth Hostel when you can stay at the Waikiki Beachside Hostel which is so much nicer, cleaner, safer and comfortable. Thank you to the staff of the Waikiki Beachside Hostel for making my 5th trip to Honolulu a very pleasant and memorable experience.

Diamond Head was a good hike up but the view was the best. I went para-sailing and that was so fun I want to do it again. They have a culture center there. Well worth the time to go see especially the evening show. There is a farmers marker in the evening for a few days of the week. Excellent local food.Front desk people were so friendly and helpful and they can tell you about anything local if you ask. A few nights in the lounge area there was one or two people that got loud but did last all night. The last couple nights I was there it was very quiet. Food was expensive to me to eat but there was a store of the corner that had daily salads for about $4. But ask the front desk people and they will tell yo where to go.

I was a bit worried after reading a couple reviews about bedbugs. Despite the daily cleaning I got attacked by a bedbug in the 1st night. I had to switch rooms.. TWICE ! That was the only downside of this whole experience.The hostel overall is great. Let me separate into small topics so it's easier to follow. LOCATION - Perfect (the street is a bit dirty and ugly cause it's the backside of the hotels and stuff), great for anyone who is just gonna walk around town, ride a bike (recommend you BUYING a bycicle at WALMART to really get to know the place around) or a car. Bought a bike for $ 85 and sold it for $ 40 a week later when I left.STAFF - Really good. They are all helpful and friendly ready to solve your questions about the main activities and places.ROOMS - Really good as well. I would suggest paying $5 extra dollars and getting the small dorm (only 2people + 2people from semi-private room) instead of paying $ 28 for the possible packed 8 dorm. I stayed in both rooms (both good) cause the 8dorm had only 4 people in it. VALUE - Best deal you can find. The 7th night is free, which is a really good deal that other hostels don't have (as far as I remember). So this is by far the best option for the price. Rooms are good, clean + free breakfast (bread + butter + peanut butter + coffe) + free wi-fi. OBSERVATIONS:- Hawaii isn't a place to party. I thought the crowd staying at the hostel really quiet and some of them seemed really boring. Lot of people just using their computers in the common area in the middle of a sunny afternoon. Stay home next time, nerds.- There are plenty of places to go in the Island. Try to look for: North shore (Pipeline/Waimea Bay/Sunset Beach), Lanikai/Kailua, Haiku stairs, Diamond head, Ala Moana Beach Park, Koolina Lagoons, Makaha, Pali Lookout, Army Museum, Turtle bay resort beach, Hanauma Bay.... these are just a few good ones to visit.- BUY A BYCICLE. Best way to get around and optimize your time. It takes from 15-20min to walk the whole Waikiki Area. If you ride a bike you can go all the way trough Ala Moana and beyond. Tourists don't go that far cause walking/taking the bus is the only option they see. Take a bus to Ala Moana and look for a Walmart Store (behind the mall).- Rent Surfboards at the Maku surfstore. It is located on the street where there is a Billabong store on the corner at Kalakaua av. They have the best deals and boards.- Enjoy as much as you can the daylight. Wake up early and go running and exploring places. Nightlife is good to go out for dinner and nothing else. You will get tired of walking pass stores at night in Waikiki.Had a great time in Hawaii once again. Hope to get back soon.Regards from Brazil !Tks","Caxias Do Sul, RS","Gabriel L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Caxias Do Sul, RS</strong>",7,4.0

Zack truly made the ""impossible"" happen (I won't bore anyone with the details); and, I was able to get a reservation (other hostels were fully booked; and, hotels (low-end, medium-end and high-end were also fully booked, etc.). Zack literally worked for hours so that I could get a reservation. I spoke numerous times with Zack over the phone; and, each time I found him to be pleasant, friendly, courteous and extremely knowledgeable. Zack not only did his job ... but ... he went the extra mile (or in my case ... 10 miles!!). FYI: If you're expecting the hostel to look like The Hilton Hawaiian, Outrigger, etc., you will be disappointed (maybe even a little shocked!!). If you, however, want to spend the very minimum on lodging ($33+ per night) for a ""shared"" dorm; and, spend the rest of your hard-earned dollars on luas, water activities, island-hopping, buffets, tours, shopping, souvenirs, etc., then I highly recommend Waikiki Beach Hostel. Waikiki Beachside Hostel cleans the dorms daily. No, one should NOT expect to eat off the floors ... but it is cleaned daily. There were eight (8) females in my dorm. I met two (2) Marine Biologists, a Physicist, two (2) ""almost"" dentists from Chile; and, students from Japan, Korea, etc. Lots and lots of interesting people.The best part?? You are just one (1) street away from Waikiki Beach!! All for $33+ per night.Almost forgot ... Getting around Honolulu is easy. Oahu's public transportation is second (2nd) to none. If you don't buy a bus pass or a 4-Day Visitor's Pass, ALWAYS remember to ask for a transfer when boarding the bus (not de-boarding!!). You can buy the 4-Day Visitor's Pass at any ABC shop.Zack, I will never be able to express my sincere gratitude for all you did for me. Again, you truly went ten (10) extra miles for me. I am so thankful.

There was even a balcony with a clothes line so you could wash by machine and dry by hanging. Perfect if you wanna take off for the beach and not bother wasting time with machine drying. I also had a rental car so I parked in one of the 5 parking sports just inside the hostel gates which was a little difficult at first. It was easier to parking backwards so you could leave with ease.

She was warm and very pleasant. When I went up in the room, I wasn't expecting that the room would be that clean because I know that I am sharing the room with four other female guests, but yes, it was all neat. The sheets are clean and the air-con is working. In the bathroom, the shower is working, water lines aren't leaking, but the mirror is obviously stained and old, but I don't think that's a major problem. The kitchen inside the room is small, but complete. It gave me the perfect excuse to just buy vegetables, meat and other seasonings in the nearby grocery store and cook my own food. They also have free local calls and free WiFi (password will be provided as soon as you check-in). Safety deposit boxes are located inside the room, and you can use it for 25 cents per use. I could say that you get more than enough for what you pay for. They also have the perfect location. This hostel is really close to the beach. It's actually just behind the Aston Waikiki. Room service personnel are very friendly and in my 5-day stay, they never missed cleaning our room. Nice! The only thing that I wasn't completely happy about, is their breakfast. Although they serve free coffee and tea, they also CONSISTENTLY serve toasts, butter, peanut butter, and jam. It would have been nice if they have an alternative to this. Parties are frequent, headed by the visitors, of course and they stay up and loud until 10pm. If you feel this will affect your sleep, then you can move to the beds inside their twin sharing with air-con. In general, putting my disappointment with their breakfast aside, my stay in this hostel is one of the best. I love the place. I like the staff and it's close to everything you need. If you're a Roman Catholic, church is just a block away.

I was told I could buy one at the ABC store down the block, but the cheapest one I could find was $14. The hostel refused to reimburse me the difference, even though I was forced to buy a towel because they ran out.

Despite the fact that we'd read lots of reviews of the setup, we were still kind of amused by the layout - basically you walk into a motel-style room with twin beds and a kitchen area with dining room. At the back are two doors - one to the bathroom then another into the semi-private room, which is just more twin beds albeit behind a locked door. The other guests in the main bit were a mother and daughter and I think it's safe to say that both parties were quite relieved not to be sharing with some all-night partiers... We felt perfectly safe with them and had a good chat.Both rooms were clean, if not anything special, but the bathroom was pretty grim. As we were only there for one night I skipped the shower - it was filthy, full of other past guests' stuff and had a dirty towel in place of a bath mat...On the plus side, the staff were all friendly and helpful, the location was great and I liked the hangout area/bar downstairs. If you only need somewhere to crash and want to be in the heart of Waikiki beach, this is a good choice.

WBH is the largest and definitely has the most fun and social vibe out of the three hostels on the same street, but has a professional staff that still makes sure everything runs smoothly. It is larger than average (2 buildings facing each other with 4 floors each).Rooms are cleaned daily, the front desk is manned 24/7 (and by actual staff, not down on their luck backpackers), and the rooms are locked by magnetic wristbands that are waterproof and practically indestructible (I took it to 100 feet scuba diving and went surfing with it). Each dorm room is equipped with a kitchen, fridge, coin lockers, and bathroom. However, there is no restroom on the ground floor which is a little inconvenient if you've been drinking beers all night and live on the 4th floor. There is a large and airy lounge on the ground floor where people tend to congregate and drink after dinner and before breakfast. It's fairly easy to meet people just hanging out there. I remember earlier during my stay there was a large group that stuck to themselves, but it got easier as more people traveling along or in smaller groups of 2~4 showed up. The lounge shuts down at 10 and everyone left gets kicked out so the party people walk out to the pier or to the rest of Waikiki and everyone else can get some sleep. Now downsides: The free breakfast is just toast, but the internet cafe in the base of the eastern building serves decent breakfast food and local island food. The hostel is located at the very end of the beach so it is about a longish 20~30 minute walk to the center of Waikiki if you want to explore some other bars or take advantage of the backpacker specials on Lewers street. Some reviews talk about creepy long term guests. There were more older (35+) guests staying at this hostel (1~2 in my 8 pax dorm rooms) than I had encountered traveling in Australia or SE Asia, but the only long term guest I met was a 20 something who had been living there with his wife for a month. There were some awkward guys so if I was a girl I would try to stay in one of the girl dorms. But regardless, I would probably stay here again if I came back to Waikiki since it is close to the beach and social. Another hostel I would consider in Waikiki is the Seaside that is more centrally located, but smaller and slightly further from the beach.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States","ChK827</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States</strong>",2,4.0

Hotel prices in Hawaii are really high due to the large number of visitors, especially those coming for cold places this time of the year, like mainland US, Japan and Korea, so I decided to save some money staying at the Waikiki Beachside Hotel, in a small dormitory room (2 bedrooms, 4 beds, 1 bathroom).Many youth hostels reviews said that these places are so noisy and full of party-goes that is it really difficult to sleep, but actually there´s an ordinance that people stay quiet after 10 pm in the Waikiki area. Even on weekend nights, the Waikiki Beachside Hostel was pretty much silent after 10:30 pm, so unless you plan to go to bed at 8 or 9 pm (which you shouldn't), there is nothing to worry!Each room has its own shared bathroom and 0.25 USD lockers, which can come in handy for storaging your valuables.Locaiton is great. Waikiki beach is only a couple of minutes walk away. Since I was traveling solo, I would leave my valuables (passport, wallet) in my room and go to Waikiki Beach with my towel, sunscreen and swimming clothes only. The area is very safe even at night and there is an ABC Mart 15 seconds away on foot.Also, this hostel has a very easy access. Buses #19 and #20 take you from the airport to Waikiki and drops you off only 2 blocks away from Waikiki Beachside Hostel. Public buses going to Pearl Harbor, Ala Moana Mall, Downtown Honolulu, Diamond Head and more and trolleys going everywhere stop very close, too!Reception is open 24 hours a day and they're friendly and helpful. They have a storage service too.I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Honolulu on a budget. Oh, as for the free breakfast, it is very, very simple, but I actually had it everyday. Many guests gather there, so it's a nice time to share advice with them.","Tokyo, Japan","EdHigg</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",7,4.0

I am absolutely serious about that. Put it this way: Are you willing to spend $100/night for the hotel if you save money for something important? Why to pay so much if you need a room only to take a shower, to have a snack and some rest? That's my point! On Hawaiian islands you are basically outdoor. Hostel like this - best way to save $$$ and to meet really great people in a lounge hall. I have staid in hostels only 3 times in my life: in Arizona, Nevada and here - in Hawaii. I can tell you straight up: I fell in love with this hostel. I've spent here 1 month. Perfect place for the open-minded travelers. Rooms are clean. Staff are AWESOME - always nice and helpful. Just don't mess with basic rules, don't get drunk too much after 10 P.M. and they will treat you like V.I.P. There are only 6 guys and girls working in Waikiki Beachside Hostel - personally to me they were super nice.

We arrived around 6 pm, and the hostel was easy to find. The people working there were also very nice and friendly.My first impression was that it is a party hostel. Mostly young people (around 18-28 y.o.) that are there to meet people and have a good time. My boyfriend and I were staying in a private room and the price was very decent.The room was ok, but the thing I thought was a little weird is that you had to go through someone else's room to access yours. In the frist room, there was a kitchen with a table, fridge, stove, etc. which was nice. But we felt a little bad using it because the people in that room were always there sleeping. Anyways. The room itself was ok, but nothing more. It was clean-ish, but my overall opinion of this place is that it has potential, but it needs a little love! The paint is cracked everywhere, the mirrors and bathtub are stained, the floor is white ceramic but the cracks in between are really black (like dirty).. You know, they should fix the broken stuff just to make it a notch nicer. Apart from that, bathroom is OK; not dirty but not clean.Everything just has an old feel and that it hasn't been taken care of. The paintings on the walls are really cool though, and the patio area outside is nice, wi-fi is ok (a little slow.)We ended up looking for another place the next day, and so we decided to stay at the H.I.

Not like you are going to fall off, but you fell bad for the other person. And that's it for bad. And it's not even that big of a deal.The Good: Location is prime, right next to the Waikiki Marriot, 1.5 blocks from the beach. The staff is extreamly helpful and nice. There is 1 really surfboard for rent ($10/ 4 hours) and rest are softtops. Snorkel gear is free and there is PB&J toast for free at 9am. Next door, there is a moeped rental that gives a 10% discount if you stay.The Great: Nothing beats staying in a hostel. They have a requirement that you show you will be leaving to make sure homeless people don't just crash there (which is what 1 down the street looks like). The people who stay there are some of the greatest I've ever met in my life. We played drinking games at night, surfed (I taught) during the day. It was so insane that many of the people I met will be meeting up in each of our host cities. Life long friends are made here.From now until the day I die, I will always stay at the Beachside Hostel.

Over the 4 years that i've been staying here I've seen a lot of changes happen here and it seems like they're always trying to improve this establishment. They are always adding new things around the hostel to brighten up the place and make it more appealing to the guest! From the free wi-fi, surfboard rentals, scooter rentals next door, or the lounge for everyone to hangout in, this place is definately becoming one of the best hostels i've stayed at. They've almost caught up to the quality of the hostels in Europe that charge almost double the price! Only negative things i'd have to say about the place is the staff at the front desk at night can be a little rude, but i guess who wouldnt be dealing with a bunch of drunk kids at 4am when you're an elderly man. On the same subject, the street the hostel is on is kinda dodgy, and me being a single young female, knowing that my only protection is an elderly gentleman that couldnt outrun a turtle, it does make you think twice about going on a stroll to the beach by yourself.

There was a guy and girl that worked at the front desk during evening shifts, named Travis and Sara, both of which always came out into the lounge to interact with the guest. It seemed like even on their days off both of the workers could still be seen around the hostel socializing and befriending anyone in the lounge. Sara used to hold different theme parties in the lounge, and on big holidays would hold huge parties for the guest. Travis on the other hand would always be willing to give guest directions to local sites around the island and take people on free pubcrawls just for the sake of entertaining the guest and showing them a good time. The atmosphere they created there always brought a smile to the guest faces and I have talked to many of guest that have stayed repeatedly at this hostel solely on the fact of how good the staff made them feel welcome. This hostel does need to get the staff more involved like they used to be and Im sure they'll have more repeat guest. Kudo's tho to Chris Davis, everytime i'm there I see him and he's always there to welcome you back with a big hug and a smile! Overall this is by far the best hostel in Hawaii to stay at; Cheap, fun, and an all-around great place to stay!!!!!

The people that worked in the hostel were lovely. The rooms were very spacious. I was in a strictly all girls room. It consisted of two rooms connected, both with two single beds in each. There was a bathroom for the four of us and a full kitchen! There was also a balcony. It was clean (a little grotty but clean).Because it is such a holiday destination I found that a lot of people had travelled there alone. There was a great buzz about the place with a social area in the court yard below. People could have a full dinner at the hostel for a small charge and they could also drink and listen to music in the out door area until 10ish. This meant that everyone got speaking to each other and you were never really alone. I stayed for two nights in the hostel before moving onto a hotel.

The best thing about this hostel has to be its location from the beach - it's literally only a block away!Stayed in an bed all girls room. The room was a decent size with a kitchenette and a balcony! The dorm was separated into 2 four bed rooms which was nice for a little privacy, although mine doubled up as the kitchen/living area too. Room was of a similar standard to the two hostels I've stayed in in Edinburgh and Berlin, if slightly a little more run down - the bathroom was a bit shabby but fine. The atmosphere here was great - I met some lovely people from all over the world who were down for road trips/surfing in the daytime and drinking/endless games of Uno in the evening! A free (although limited) breakfast is provided and you get can dinner (spaghetti, burger and chips etc) for $5 a night. Staff were friendly and helpful. Travellers are mainly in their 20s with a few older ones too. BAD:However, if you're going to stay on a hostel in Lemon Road - this is the only one I'd recommend - the ones on either side of this one are quite dodgy, with more long-term travellers. On my first day, I witnessed the police carrying a guy out next door who'd got in a fight and been stabbed in the arm.Also, the nearest supermarket is like 30 mins - there are millions of convenience stores around but this is a little annoying if you want to do your own cooking and are trying to save money.","London, United Kingdom","RachelBL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",24,5.0

They helped with hand-outs and Bus information on getting around. Breakfast was low key, consisting of Toast, Tea and Coffee. My last visit (Septemember 2010) I noticed that they had a little shop in the Computer room that was offering a nice breakfast. And in the evening, they held a Bar-B-Q which you could order your dinner for a few dollars. Of course the Beach is just about 1 block away.

I stayed at the Waikiki Beachside Hostel for 1 week at the end of January. My main concern about accommodation was security for my belongings since Honolulu was a stopover trip for me, I had 2 expensive guitars and a laptop. From the first phone call the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help me. I kept my guitars in a store room which only the staff have access to and they give you a ticket to take the item out. There are reasonably large lockers in the rooms which is where I kept my laptop and cameras, they are $1 per use and quite secure. I probably could have kept that stuff in the open anyway since all the people who came through were friendly and seemed trustworthy. I was in a 4 person dorm, me and one other in the front room and 2 others in a 2 person room that locked in the back room. I did have friends in 8 person dorms who had some very shady room mates so if you're worried about that that I recommend the 4 person dorm.Basic breakfast (Toast, tea, coffee) is free from 9am and they often have a heartier option for about $4. They also have dinner on offer (burgers, pasta etc.) from 5:30ish for about $5. This is a great way to meet people.There is Free wifi in all the rooms.If people are being noisy past about 11pm, they're pretty good at telling them to shut up and go to bed so sleep quality isn't too bad, but like any hostel in a busy area, I recommend ear plugs.Hi lights in the area were climbing Diamond Head, snorkeling at Hanauma Bay, finding the beach where LOST was shot (kinda near pipeline) and skydiving on the North Shore (find a van with a rainbow on the side that says ""skydiving"" and talk to them to organise it).DO NOT STAY AT PACIFIC OHANA NEXT DOOR!This place looked so shady, I think they have a lot of long term tenants and there's all sorts of weird people and sounds coming from it, I've only heard bad things.A few of these shady looking people smoke out the front of Waikiki Beachside Hostel but don't seem to come in.","Vancouver, Canada","wayfarther</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",19,4.0

Definitely a steal considering the price of places in Honolulu. The location here is amazing!!! You are literally less than a block from the beach. There are also several bus stops, convenience stores, and restaurants within a block or so. The staff is great. Much better than I've had at real hotels.

(I should note that these people work here full time, they are not working temporarily in exchange for lodging like at many other hostels.)The rooms were ok. I would guess they were pretty standard for hostels. There were 8 bunks in the room we stayed in. I wanted to stay with my boyfriend so we were in a co-ed room. I was the only girl though. There was also a microwave, refrigerator, a table with some chairs, and a balcony. The beds are definitely not comfortable, but you get what you pay for. A maid came through daily, but the room was still pretty messy. Especially the bathroom. I would attribute this to the 5-7 guys that were in the room at any one time though. From what I saw of the all girl rooms, they were much cleaner, lol. The other people staying there were super nice. Definitely gave me the multicultural hostel atmosphere that I was looking forward to. The lounge is great if you just wanna hang out and relax. There's a huge tv and some boardgames and vending machines. I always felt really safe here. It's kind of in an alley, but it is well lit and generally just a nice, touristy part of town.

The guy at the front desk, David, was very helpful, and all the staff were friendly. But if you're expecting the Hilton, with all the amenities, you're in the wrong neighborhood. Sheets are free, but bring your own towel.But for a middle-aged dude, it was a great place to crash, although my former roommate snored like a pig being raped by the Hell's Angels. I just moved next door and solved the problem.As far as cleanliness--well, it seemed clean to me. You have to provide your own definition of ""Clean."" Remember, you might be sleeping in the same room with seven other men who might've been surfing, hiking, sweating, and drinking all day, so ""Clean"" is a relative term. If you're a military veteran, or active duty, it's just like the barracks.Overall, it's a cool place to stay for little money.

I have stayed at hostels off-and-on since I was in my 20s (I am now in my 60s and probably the oldest one staying there at the time). Wow! Was my decision a good one. It was so much fun and just a busride away from the rest of my family. It is literally a block away from the beach and a hop-skip to the zoo and aquarium. I roomed with women from Sweden, France and Switzerland. The staff was friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean with TV, a microwave and a refrigerator. There is free breakfast, but you are also offed a homemade breakfast for $5. At night there is a barbeque offered for $5. The food is delish!

If you can come here, try to stay in a two-person room. odds are good you will have it to yourself. you can still easily meet people in the lobby or during the barbeque.

I have the option to retreat to the privacy of my room or to mingle with the guests and staff in the common meeting area. The common meeting area is a great place to meet new people, read a book, eat dinner, watch television, and simply relax. What I like the most about the Hostel is its location next to the beach, and all the conveniences that surround it, like internet access, moped rentals, and good food and shops.
