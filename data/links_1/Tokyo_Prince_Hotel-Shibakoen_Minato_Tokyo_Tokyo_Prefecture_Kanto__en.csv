When we arrived at Haneda Airport we took the easiest, and cheapest route to take: THE MONORAIL - don't be afraid of the train, it is safe and a cheap way to travel. Step one: After leaving customs and immigration, head over to the monorail terminal on the left side. Purchase your ticket to the Hamamatsucho station. I think it's about 800 Yen (or about 8 USD) or chose to get an IC card from the machine and place enough on it for your return - my husband and I put about 1600 YEN on the cards (we bought two for both of us). Take the RED line to Hamamatsucho station - it will be the last stop. Once you arrive, follow the signs to the bus terminals at the station. It's not a far walk, just follow the signs. Get to bus terminal 5, which is at the end of the bus terminal (not far). Wait for the Tokyo Prince Shuttle. They will take you to your hotel for free. They do stop at another hotel, so make sure you get off at the right one! Easy! Check in was a simple process as we made reservations ahead of time, of course. They will take a credit card, but make sure you have cash (YEN) as almost every place will only accept cash. Wait until you change your money once you get to Japan and you may do so at a 7-11 ATM (yes, they have 7-11 everywhere!). We arrived at our room which was beautiful and had a wonderful view. The bathroom was well stocked with needed items, such as razors, toothbrushes, shampoo, etc. They even provided lounge robes for our stay. Everyone was so helpful and our room had a mini fridge, which we stocked well with snacks and drinks from the Lawson market located on the Basement level. We were close to the Tokyo Tower and also the Temple where Wolverine filmed the funeral scene! This made sightseeing easy and fun. I cannot express how truly great this hotel was and we highly recommend Tokyo Prince Hotel! Thank you to the wonderful staff for making our stay Perfect!

The beauty of Tokyo is that all areas are easily accessed by train or metro so it doesn't really matter where you stay.This hotel is semi close to the Hamamatsucho station and several metro stations, but a little too far to walk from these stations to the hotel with bags. Fortunately, the hotel runs an hourly courtesy bus from the Hamamatsucho station. The hotel is medium priced, with a beautiful foyer. The rooms are good but just beginning to get a touch tired at the edges; nothing too bad though.The area between the hotel and Hamamatsucho station is excellent for dining; there are hundreds of options.One thing to keep in mind is that if exploring the close by [short metro trip] Roppongi Hills area/art triangle, and the Mid Town complex, is that most stores and galleries don't open till 10am or 11am so one has to find something else to do till late morning.

The hotel is located very near the Tokyo Tower so easy to find!! First impressions are very good, this is a large hotel and the reception / restaurant floor is huge. Welcome was good and check-in very easy. Most staff had some English language and we certainly did not have a problem being understood.First half of my stay was in a standard room. It was a fair size (especially, as I understand, for Tokyo) but gave the impression of being a little dated due to a lot of wooded painted furniture. Maybe the effect was exaggerated in contrast to the huge, modern and luxury reception floor! However, the room was reasonably equipped, clean and comfortable. Later in my stay I moved to a Club floor room which was very much larger, better equipped and felt more modern (but a lot more expensive!). My slight disappointment in both rooms was that the shower was an 'over the bath' type rather than a walk in but I guess some people prefer the bath.The restaurants in the hotel are extremely good (at least the ones we used) but very expensive. There didn't seem to be much in the way of restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel either. There is a small convenience store under the hotel in the basement level with very basic food, drink and general store options. It does usefully have a cash machine that accepted my UK cash-card.There is an airport limousine bus that regularly connects the hotel to Narita for 3,100 Yen.

Shiba-Koen, I thought, was not a bad choice because of its central location in the city. I knew this hotel was old and operated by the local company (which may be slow to catch up international hotel changing standards in time). I have stayed many 5 or 4-star hotels in Tokyo for the last twenty years. The TA reviews about this hotel also gave me a very mixed feeling before I checked-in. Here are my observations for recent three nights stay. Pros: - Location: easy access to Tokyo Tower and the underground station (Onarimon station- operated by Toei, not a big subway operator comparing Tokyo metro). - Room size barely acceptable (considering Tokyo situation)Cons:- Local staff's poor English communication capability everywhere - Literally no true concierge services (because of a language barrier and lack of training for this services)- Very small bathroom (not a room, it is a bath module with a low height. big western people may be very difficult to have a proper shower), poor shower mechanical facility- Club lounge (not convenient, in a far corner of lobby floor with no windows at all, meditation room?... Minimum beverages and no hot dishes...Never experienced this kind of lounge in my life.) - Chance of being bumped into a large unmannered loud tour groupOthers- Breakfast was acceptable (Western, Asian, a few vegitalian..)My unpleasant case: - One morning, I stopped by the concierge and asked about the Toei-bus route (the largest bus operator in Tokyo) map because I was sick of moving around in the dark underground. At first it seemed to me the local staff (Mr. Maeda) did not understand my inquiry in English (I asked two times) he suddenly showed me a big Tokyo tour guide pamphlet which carried only sub-way routes. I asked again with more clear and easy English words - B U S.. Route.. M A P.. He threw the pamphlet on the desk with a noise, again. (Oops-) I called out the duty manager and complained.. only to found out that I could not get the proper simple concierge service..... No one wants to start the day with a very unpleasant memory. I am the guest paid a regular room charge. Well 1) This incident changed my general feelings of Japanese manner and hospitality which they have boasted of a long time 2) How will they host 2020 Tokyo Olympic games with this kind of manner?

I loved this hotel so much more than I expected. I once stayed at Intercontinental Tokyo Bay, but Tokyo Prince Hotel is waayyyy better! The room condition, staff, the view, everything! I personally thought the cheapest room of Tokyo Prince Hotel was even better than Club room at Intercontinental Tokyo Bay.Tokyo Tower view was fantastic! I was afraid I might see the only part of Tokyo Tower because it is so close to the hotel but I could see the whole Tokyo Tower, loved the view and could seat there and watch it forever.Tokyo Prince Hotel was beyond perfect up until I met the rudest hotel staff in my whole life! I went down for the breakfast, I admit it was super busy sunday morning, packed.There were tables along the window to see out the garden, but the tables were all taken and I was informed to seat at the sofa at the back, which was fine.Later I saw that the table along the window was empty so I walked to a male staff who was cleaning the table and said 'Excuse me' in English. Then, that male staff didn't even bother to look at me and yelled at me ""NO!"". NO what? I only said Excuse me with a smile. He couldn't be bothered to deal with me and he waved at other staff then she came to me, walked with me back to my table and explained that this table along the window is only for 3 or more people. So I said I understand that now, and thank you for kindly explaining that to me, and that male staff was super rude. (The kind female staff was Miss Ryuda, European who can speak fluent English and Japanese). She tried to cover that he isn't normally like that but he did only because it was busy morning. I still don't think that gives him a permission to yell at a customer. I have never been yelled at a hotel, even at the crappy one. This was definitely something you don't expect from 4~5 star hotels, and definitely not from Tokyo Prince Hotel.Tokyo Prince Hotel has its history, its pride to be one of the oldest hotel is Tokyo, and the perfect Tokyo Tower view but the whole thing can be ruined by one staff who thinks he can yell at a customer if he is swampted at work.I talked to the front desk while I was checking out about this, I didn't have much time and there was no manager available at that time, so instead of complaining at their face I wrote a very very long customer feedback. Hope the general manager received the feedback. I still can feel the anger when I think about what happened at the Tokyo Prince Hotel.

Both are within 500 metes of each other and within a 5 minute walk to the iconic Tokyo tower. Princes Park hotel is more expensive but for that you get to stay in a more modern and upmarket hotel. Nicer rooms better breakfast buffet selection and stunning views. Prince hotel by comparison is a 3 star compared to a good  4 star. Its still nice and for Tokyo hotel accomodation value for money. Rooms especially by Tokyo standards are are good size. The hotel is getting a little long in the tooth and coyld do with some modernization but havinf said that they are clean and comfortable.

My top tip if you can have the choice and are staying more in central Tokyo fly into Haneda Airport rather than Narita Airport . Its so much closer and handier. Prince Park hotels are both connected to Haneda Airport with Bus Limousine service that will take you to the airport for 950 yen. A taxi is about 20 minutes in light Traffic and cost around 6500 yen.

Arrived after lunch but was hungry because no lunch had been served on the plane and I was jet lagged. Most of the food options in the hotel were closed and there is NO ROOM SERVICE!!!! Eventually found a snack in the lobby bar. Later that evening visited the buffet restaurant for dinner... but left because the buffet was awful. Very poor choices for a very expensive buffet price - maybe only 2 or 3 main course options on the buffet! This morning had breakfast in the buffet restaurant - again pretty poor choices (better than last night though). A few limited western options, at least, some fruit, some toast, pancakes and something approximating to bacon. The room I have (deluxe room) is plenty large enough, but very old. The desk has no plug sockets. There is no air conditioning so the room was very hot last night (I managed to get the window open a crack, but its still hot in here). Bed is comfortable, but the twin beds are narrow single beds rather than the more usual doubles. The soundproofing of the rooms is non-existent - last night I was kept awake until 2am by the people (at least 3 voices) in the neighbouring room. I eventually knocked on their door and asked them to be quiet. Similarly, when I was trying to take a nap in the afternoon, the noise from people shouting in the corridor was deafening. Its surprising in Japan to find such a poorly designed hotel. The bathroom is both tiny and clearly ancient although there are plenty of toiletries provided. Neither a proper bath nor shower - just one of those japanese half-tubs with a hand shower - which I would not expect in a hotel of this price. The convenience store in the basement is - well - convenient. The location is fine because my client is in this area and it's a 10 minute walk to the Monorail to Haneda airport. Nice park grounds and temple next to hotel. Airport bus takes 40 mins (apparently, did not take it yet) but this is slower than taking the monorail to Haneda. There is also a bus to Narita. On balance I would not stay here again.","Various, UK, Aus, NZ, HK","fairhsa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Various, UK, Aus, NZ, HK</strong>",121,3.0

There is a shuttle service that takes you to the nearby train station to take the monorail to the airport (Haneda) Unfortunately do not expect the shuttle driver to assist you with your baggage and you will have to carry your own bags up the stairs of the bus, as for unknown reasons they do not use the storage compartments on the side of the bus.

Windowless room with no character and poor quality food. While my reservation said ""breakfast included"" and I was assured by the booking agent that it was the regular hotel breakfast (which costs 2500 yen when not included in the room rate) this turned out not to be the case.

They recited the Nembutsu Prayer accompanied by drums on the left, it was an ecstatic atmosphere. The congregation was invited to remove their shoes and led up to the Main Altar. We participated in the ""Havan"" (ritual of sprinkling sesame-like seeds & offering them into the consecrated fire), given pieces of white paper to place on our tongue, handed an elongated peacock feather to touch the feet of Amida Buddha.

The hotel's HVAC system had already been converted to heat mode and it was not possible to turn on the air conditioning. While low 70s may not sound like it necessarily warrants A/C, being on the 10th floor, combined with humidity outside made it very uncomfortable. The hotel also had no fans - their answer to the temperature issue was ""open the window!""Everything else was okay. The hotel itself is old, very outdated and in dire need of renovation. The staff meant well, but I think there are probably better places to stay at about the same price.One very bright point was the convenience store on the basement level of the hotel.

The Tokyo Prince Hotel seems like it used to be a truly excellent 5 star hotel, which slowly degraded to 3/4 star territory. The good news is that this means that the rooms are very big by Tokyo standards. The bad news is that the bathroom, furniture and other equipment is visibly old. I gladly took this trade-off, as I truly enjoy being able to open my suitcase without stepping into the bathroom.The staff spoke fairly decent English, but they were fairly overloaded so they couldn't always be as helpful as they would have preferred to be. The reservation system was a bit funky, as the smoking and non-smoking rooms are not reserved separately, but instead your preference is recorded separately as a ""best effort"" comment. This would explain why other reviewers ended up in smoking rooms despite their preference.The air conditioner worked very well and was unusually quiet, which is important in the Japanese summer. The smallish LCD TV had the standard Japanese channels, but no foreign broadcasts. The bed was big and comfy. There were individual mini wifi-routers for the rooms, which helped keep the wifi link uncongested. The only real problem I had with the room equipment was that the mini-fridge emitted an incredibly loud and sharp screeching noise, even by mini-fridge standards. There was a sign on the fridge saying that if the noise bothers you, you should turn the fridge off. I took their advice but was left without convenient access to cold beverages. Fortunately there are vending machines on several floors, and there is a fully stocked convenience store right on the basement floor of the Hotel.The Hotel is located in the garden of the Zojo-ji, a very pretty Buddhist temple with a nicely groomed park surrounding it (it is especially beautiful in cherry-blossom season). Too bad the area in front of the hotel was converted to a huge parking lot instead of leaving it as a park. There are indoor and outdoor restaurants on the premises, and the eateries of the Hamamatsucho-area are also within the reach of an 8 minute walk.The nearest train station is the Onarimon subway station on the Toei Mita line (so getting to the Imperial Palace and Tokyo station is no problem).

It was more like a soggy/humid kind of smell mixed with cigarette smell. Our room was SMALL – we were running out of luggage space! Two guests, four luggage, and a bunch of shopping bags. We had no room to walk without tripping over our bags. Our room had quite the view! Right outside our window was the Tokyo Tower. It was a nice way to see the tower without having to walk over to the tower. So, asking for a tower-facing room would be your best bet if you have no intention of going to the Tokyo Tower.The staff was extremely friendly – from the moment we checked-in to our departure, the staff was friendly and helpful.Although they were not super fluent at English, after a few attempts in re-phrasing our concern/inquiry, they were able to assist us and provide us with answers.

Most of my negative feelings are probably from a lack of understanding, or a failure on my part to fully read and understand various options the hotel has to offer. First off, the good:This hotel is in a really nice quiet location. It has semi-quick access to 4 different stations:Onarimon (Subway)Hamamatucho (Monorail, Trains)Daimon (Subway)Kamiyacho (Subway)The area is very quiet, almost too quiet. But if you want to feel like you are not in the city, this area is great for that. There are a few temples near by, one of which is right next door. The Zojo-ji temple. You also have very close access to the Tokyo Tower (not to be confused with the Tokyo Skytree). This place is an easy 10 minute or less walk from the hotel. The room was quite spacious, and had a decent TV, Chairs, large bed (King for us), and a nice view. We were on the 10th floor so we could see quite a distance.There was a convenience store in the basement level of the hotel. This was by far the most money saving option we had as far as food. Not only that, but the service was fantastic. Speaking of service. The hotel staff is very friendly. They are quick to help you, and find someone who can speak English if they are not familiar. I was very happy with their service. Now for the not so good:Laundry service. If you absolutely must have the hotel do laundry, be prepare to pay big bucks. I misread the paper, and thought our bill was going to be about 3,000 Yen (or about 30.00). Nope, not even close. It turned out to be 13,000 Yen! Or roughly 115.00 USD! This was for 2 very small bags of cloths. Needless to say, I wasn't happy at all with this. I attempted to speak to the laundry manager, but they said the price was fixed.Restaurants = Expensive! Talk about over priced. I'm not talking just a little bit, I'm taking 2 meals were 75.00 USD! Not only that, but the food quality was not the best. We ate at the Shimizu Japanese restaurant for some sushi. Some of the sushi was good, but I've had better in the states, which was quite disappointing. Also, unless you are willing to pay out the wazoo for breakfast at their buffet, don't bother. It was ""okay"", but I ended up preferring to get food from the in house convenience store on the basement level. Mixed Feelings:The bed. The bed was as hard as a stone slab, but quite honestly, we got a good night sleep on it. Just don't lay for too long, or your back will end up a rock itself. The AC in the room wasn't very cold (perhaps I'm just used to colder air). The staff was really nice, and brought up a floor fan to help cool off the room. Final Thoughts:Would I visit this hotel again? Maybe (if there were no better options).Would I find a hotel in the surrounding area? Yes.Would I ever eat at the hotel restaurants again? No.Would I recommend to others? Yes, but only without warnings on the *extra costs* that might sneak up on you.","Fort Worth, Texas","onetravelingbear</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Worth, Texas</strong>",16,3.0

But if you still have energy after dinner, I strongly recommend you to walk to the closed by neighbourhood - Roppongi Hills. This is a newly developed area attracting for international visitors. There are some stores and restaurants as well as a variety of other facilities such as an art museum, and cinema. The viewing platform on the 52nd floor of Mori Tower above Roppongi Hills offers unbroken view of Tokyo Tower and the surrounding areas.There is only one downside from the hotel: Even the hotel guest will be charged JPY2000 per day to access to the hotel swimming pool. This is the only hotel that charges swimming pool access for its guests by far for me. I thought this rule could be optimised in the future.","Beijing, China","Zangwill</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beijing, China</strong>",37,4.0

It has a huge car park (for central Tokyo) out front and is surrounded by temples.I would agree that there are parts of the property that are a little tired but here are the good bits:The rooms are far bigger than anything you will get in Tokyo at a similar price, you actually have room to move and open a suitcase here. The rooms I've found are always clean although some of the rooms are a little worn.There are 3 subway stations 1 JR station and a Monorail to Haneda airport all within walking distance. The Ginza is just a few stops away.Haneda airport is a short monorail ride and 520 Yen away compared to Narita at 3000 depending on how you go and Haneda is in my opinion a much nicer airport. Hammatsucho is a 10 minute walk away from the hotel, so bars and good local restaurants as well as western options are everywhere.Roppongi and Tokyo tower are also close at hand, you can actually walk to and from Roppongi if you want to save a cab or tube fare. Rooms on the back of the hotel have lovely Tower views.The hotel does have vending machines on each floor but more importantly has Lawsons shop in the basement for most of your needs.On the bad side: The breakfast is expensive for what it is, as is the food and coffee in the lobby. I do thing that this is a common problem in hotels though.The rooms do need attention and a refurb would be most welcomed.Overall though the hotel is very good value for money, cheap for its room size and setting.If you are looking for an action packed tourist experience, don't go there.However if you want a quiet base for business or pleasure, this hotel is well worth a try.Great central location, lots of food choices, and quiet.

There isn't much to do around the hotel so if you're looking for a hotel with action right outside the door, don't book here. There seemed to be a lot of tour companies having their guests stay here. Every morning, they would be a huge tour bus bringing dozens of elderly tourists to and from. We considered moving to an area with more nightlife but didn't end up moving.

I paid $150/night including breakfast buffet and free in-room Internet. As others have pointed out, the property needs to be updated to be at the level of a top Tokyo Hotel, but this is a far better value. I would stay at this hotel again for many reasons. Location: it is away from the hustle bustle but walkable to Hibya; subway stop Onarimon on the Mita line is essentially on the property. Peacefulness: Like many Prince hotels, there is greenery on the property. Gorgeous azaleas were in bloom during my trip. You can walk next door to the beautiful grounds of the Zojo-ji Buddhist temple and buy incense from the monks, and access a large park behind it with flower gardens and people walking their dogs. The area is very quiet and you can get a good night's sleep - I heard birds instead of trains in the morning. My room was large enough to do morning yoga and Qi Gong, and I had a great view of the Tokyo Tower (Tokyo's Eiffel). While the hotel restaurants are expensive, there is a Le Pain Quotidien adjacent to the property with that delicious Euro bread and inexpensive red wine - no matter how much you like Japanese food, after 6 days you are ready for something other than salty fish fare! Le Pain is a huge plus in my book. Speaking of red wine, not to mention cheese: there is a Lawson convenience store in the hotel basement, open until midnight you can go down in your slippers! Rooms have refrigerators and hot water makers, and you know you're in a real Japanese hotel when the vending machines have beer. The bus to Haneda and Narita comes to the property. My bus to Narita stopped at a few fancy Ginza hotels, and noticing the crowds and noise I felt happy that I had stayed at the Prince.","La Jolla, California","hollyberry57</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Jolla, California</strong>",57,4.0

The best part of staying there was how convenient the location was. It was close to the Hamamatsucho station on the JR Line. There is also a free shuttle bus that goes to and from the hotel to the station, which we appreciated on days when our feet were too tired to walk anymore. The hotel is also next to the Tokyo Tower, which we spent an afternoon at on a rainy day. The downside of the hotel is that it does not cater to English speakers. There were no TV stations in English and the staff spoke limited English. That was fine by us, as we had done a great deal of research in advance of our trip. Also, I hired for our first day in Tokyo an excellent guide, who took us to the Meiji Shrine (a highlight), toy shopping on Takeshita Street, and cruising on the Sumida River. Our guide also gave us a good introduction to riding the trains and travel trips for the remainder of our week. We were very fortunate to be in Tokyo when the cherry blossoms were blooming. The best viewing we found was in Ueno Park, which was very crowded on a weekday. I wouldn’t attempt to go there on a weekend. As we were jet legged having traveled from Minneapolis, we were awake early on our second day in Tokyo and did go to the Tuna Auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market. They only allow 120 people to go in each morning. We took a taxi from our hotel at 4:00 a.m. Make sure your taxi driver drops you at the right gate to line up for the tuna auction. When we arrived at 4:30 a.m. we were number 109 & 110 in line. Many people showed up in the dark after us and didn’t get in that morning. It was a terrific and unique experience. We also signed up for a day trip to Mt. Fuji and Hakone in advance of going to Tokyo. We were picked up at our hotel and spent a day riding a bus as part of a tour group. The weather was good so we saw Mt. Fuji. Some tours are two-days with an overnight in Hakone, but I am glad we only did this as a day trip. The highlight of the day trip was riding the Shinkansen Bullet Train from the Odawa Station to Tokyo Station. What a thrill!I had read that the Tokyo Prince hotel had a line of people when they opened the breakfast buffet and that was a problem. We only had breakfast early one day, the day we took our day trip to Mt. Fuji. The buffet opens at 7:00 a.m. and we went down for breakfast about 7:15 a.m. The dining room was crowded, but they open adjacent rooms to accommodate the demand. That is to say, we found the breakfast buffet opportune and tasty with both Japanese and Western items to select from. We did have every breakfast at the hotel, though we did not eat any other meals there. The hotel does not have room service, which we wish it did as there were a couple of times we did not want after a long day of touring to have to put our walking shoes back on to go find dinner.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","Mike D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",16,4.0

We requested a room on an upper floor with a view of the Tokyo Tower and they accommodated us perfectly. The view of the tower was incredible, especially when it was lit up at night. The room was smallish by American standards but perfectly adequate size-wise. It definitely was not shockingly small like I'd been warned about Tokyo hotels. The bed was hard, being pregnant this was a definite downside. Walking all day around Tokyo and then sleeping on a hard bed made me very sore. I would guess that a more Western hotel would have the softer beds? There were three train stations near the hotel, one was a five minute walk, another a ten minute walk, and the one we used most often was fifteen minutes from the back of the hotel. The hotel had very expensive restaurants and the tea room was extremely over-priced. We only tried the tempura restaurant and it was not great to our palettes but it was crowded so I'm guessing others liked it. The restaurant was gorgeous, though. We never ate at the tea room since it was way too expensive. I was glad I had brought lots of breakfast foods with me to eat in the morning and then we ate around town the rest of the day.The hotel staff was very friendly and nice. You definitely had to know Japanese to be able to communicate with them however. We would always try speaking English and then resort to Japanese to get our full point across. I imagine if you didn't know any Japanese you would not be able to ask them about how to get places or recommendations very easily at all. You would just have to tell them very basic things in English. They didn't have an ice machine but were willing to send ice to our room for free. The tub was very deep and nice. The heated bidet/toilet and heated steam-free mirror were pretty fun, too. Overall, it was a great deal, and we loved the view. Probably not the closest location, depending on what you wanted to see.

After getting a tiny room (must have been a single-room), getting upgraded to a bigger, but dirty, smokingroom, we finally got a nice big room. The reception area was huge and reminded of some transportation terminal, there was even a taxi-stop outside the hotel, filled with taxis. The hotel had an overall 60/70-feel to it, which is ok, but could have been better maintained. A bucket of paint would have done wonders for the place. The hotel also had a small shopping mall in the basement, with a small convenience-store, your usual souvenirs, but also furniture and 1 000 000-yen priced purses (and that was on sale!). We found all this very strange for a mid-range hotel. The food was good, both the full breakfast buffet and the light breakfast buffet were good, and the japanese style had both good sushi and tempura meals. A bit pricey, but good. As for the pool, we didn't use it because they charged 1000 yen pr day, even for the guests, and tattoos were actually not permitted in the pool area! The location is good, close to several underground stations, and right by Tokyo Tower, which is actually pretty cool. The view of Tokyo by night from 250 meter is awesome!The room we finally got was ok, good size and a good sized bed. The bathroom amenities were also good. The personell were friendly and polite.

Both of them are Prince hotels - be careful not to make the same mistake!The Superior rooms face the swimming pool, not the Tokyo Tower which we wanted, the receptionist did not recommend the standard rooms...OK. So the room was clean, but old. You could see on the appliances that the white plastic was already beige and so. However the high point was the bed: it was 2.3m wide (close to 8 ft)! Amazing, I've never seen such a big bed. Also the room was pretty large, 35 sq m (~400 sq ft).The receptionists spoke English, but the concierge was really incompetent and the limousine/ shuttle services were badly organized. There is a free shuttle to the closest train station, but it stops by other hotels so you end up getting there slower than if you went on foot! The airport shuttle is equally inconvenient: it takes 3 hours because it stops by other hotels too. It is better to take a cab to the Tokyo station and the train - we were at the airport in 1.5 hours.The concierge service was incompetent: we were trying to get to Odaiba Island and the person first looked at the map then still could not tell which is the correct metro/train to take. At the end he recommended two connections where one was enough on our way back. This Odaiba Island, if you aren't familiar with Tokyo, is like Central Park in New York. So imagine you stay in a hotel on Manhattan, ask the concierge how to get to Central Park and the guy has no clue...The Swimming pool was another low point. The whole pool is about 3-4 ft/ 1.1 m deep and the water was way too warm, you can hardly swim in it. Despite that the ask $15 per person from hotel guests to enter the pool. If you want to sit on a sunbed, it is another $30, and these sunbeds are at least 10-15 year old, white plastic already with a brown tint from the sun, not very appetizing.

Roppongi is a 15-20 minute walk in the opposite direction with lots of restaurants on offer ranging from traditional Japanese to Italian, Mexican, American and various other Western options. Toji Temple is also directly next to the hotel offering great photo's and culture on your doorstep. There are 4-5 restaurants in the hotel and we had sushi one evening at the secluded Sushi bar. I was a little disappointed in the quality (given that we were in Japan I expected it to be the highest level/grade sushi) and the chefs are not willing to deviate from the menu at all so you are forced to order only from the limited options they have (I'm pregnant so was trying to order only the cooked fish - ie. shrimp/crab but they didn't understand me at all). The staff in the hotel are helpful and friendly, but sometimes the language barrier proves an issue as their English is limited. The breakfast buffet was excellent with lots to choose from but be warned, it opens at 7am sharp and on the days we went at this time there was a long line out the door waiting for tables. So you're better off heading down a little later and not having to wait - the same options will still be available (minus perhaps cereal one morning as all the little boxes has already been taken). So all in all a good hotel with all the amenities you may need on a basic level.

We had been told we'd get a king sized bed but when we got there, they had already passed it on to someone else. Not a big thing as they managed to get it for us the next day. However, I didn't find that they were willing to help or were more grumpy because we were asking for something they should have given to us in the first place. The hotel room was huge and the bed was comfortable so we had really good sleep. In terms of decor, it is definitely a bit outdated but considering for what we had paid for it, we didn't mind it at all!!!
