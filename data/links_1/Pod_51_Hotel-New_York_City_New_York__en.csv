Having read the tripadvisor reviews prior to booking, I decided on this hotel. We got the airlink and subway from the airport even though late at night, the subway stop is literally 5 mins walk from the hotel, which was a lot cheaper than a taxi. Room was clean, small but adequate for city break as didn’t spend much time in the room or hotel. Only comment would be that the shower is a glass door into the bedroom, which wasn’t any issue for us, but may be a problem for anyone staying with a friend or family member who isn’t their partner. Hotel has a small cafe downstairs which we didn’t try, so can’t comment. Upstairs has a small sun deck and chairs with a good view, probably nice in the summer! Hotel reception were efficient checking us in and out and looked after our bags in the storage room due to us having an evening flight. Ideal location, 10 walk to rockafella and 15-20 mins to Times Square! Would definitely stay at this hotel again if choosing a budget friendly city stay.

Check-in was quick and simple, can't remember the name of the guy but he was very friendly and was eager to help. Note that you don't get much documentation about the hotel in your room (if a small menu for the cafe downstairs was in the rooms I would have went a lot sooner)of what is nearby but if you ask at reception they had pages of nearby bars/restaurants that they gave.If you go accepting the fact you aren't getting a huge room and accept it is a budget hotel, you'll love it. Cosy rooms albeit a bit more sound protection from the hallway would have been preferred (I fear my loud snoring may have went through to every room ).I opted for a full pod which included a bathroom inside, tight squeeze but worth it I feel. Rooms included a safe, comfortable bed and a TV. Make sure you do one of the walking tours offered by the hotel.When you're visiting NY you'll not be spending much time in your room but Pod 51 was a perfect location to be able to get out in the morning, pop back for a recharge if needed and head out again.

I opted for a room where you share a bathroom with people on your floor. They were pretty small and didn't have much space for me to set my things but long as they were cleaned regularly, they were fine. The rooms however were tiny. My friend and I stayed in a bunk bed and we could barely stand next to each other. IT WAS TINY. The walls are also very thin. Also, you better hope you're not neighbors with any couples because I heard the action as if i was right there with them LOL.I think its a decent place to stay if you book a room with a private bathroom.

Overall, it is definitely a hybrid of a hostel and micro hotel. Did not get to check out the roof, but it is February. It was considerably cleaner than I expected, but the hallways were quite dim. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Will hold your bags on checkout day if you have plans beyond checkout time. I stayed in a queen room with private bath; the shower was about 30""x30"". On morning #1, I had hot water in the shower within a minute; on morning #2, it was an 8-9 minute wait for hot water (I ate a cup of yogurt and a banana and still had time to kill). Bath and hand towels were provided, but no washcloths. When I inquired about this on checkout, they told me that they had a limited quantity, and washcloths were available upon request, I found this to be quite odd. Other reviewers mentioned difficulty with rooms being either quite warm or quite chilly. When I returned from dinner on night #1, the room was 76 degrees; I switched from heat to AC, set it at 72 degrees and the room stayed around 70 all night. I turned the heat back on for about an hour on evening #2, and then went back to AC, and the temperature was fine, overall. Other reviewers also commented on the noise from outside of the hotel. I didn't have a problem with this at all. The walls are not at all soundproofed, however, and I could easily hear the shower running on the other side of the wall, and people talking in the room on the other side of me. Overall, it was convenient, clean, and met my needs for a very reasonable price close to midtown. Close to subway stops and lots of good restaurants. Will definitely stay here, or at another Pod, again when in Manhattan.","Harrisburg, Pennsylvania","sand0113</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</strong>",4,4.0

The room layout was as expected--a small room but everything needed was there and this had the full bath. The bed was reasonably comfortable and it would have been fine for my travel needs for this trip. What I did not expect was the noise level in the room from the outside. The room was on the second floor and had a cheap in-window AC unit with an accordion-like space filler on each side of the unit. That meant there was only a thin piece of plastic separating the room from the street. As a result, I heard EVERYTHING from the street--even peoples conversations at the front of the hotel. The purgatory started with a very loud dripping noise on the metal AC cover from water generated by the AC in the room a floor above at 4 AM, I mean loud! I am a sound sleeper but this woke me up. Since the window was sealed around the AC, I could not open it to put something on top of the AC to stop the loud dripping. The water torture lasted for about 30 minutes and was enhanced at 420 AM by garbage trucks with whining hydraulics. The final auditory volley was delivered about 630 AM from some ungodly generator noise outside along with the delivery trucks.The other thing that bugged me a bit was that the floor was covered by an indoor-outdoor carpet that had no padding underneath, making the floor pretty hard, and the carpet did not seem that clean to me.

We only realised this after turning the air-con off on the first night and assumed it might be a generator outside our window or something, so requested to move rooms and they did oblige. The new room was on the outside of the building rather than the inside which they said was quieter, and while it was a bit quieter I could still hear the noise even with foam earplugs in. I will stress that the aircon was definitely turned off. Luckily we were exhausted each night and slept ok but for light sleepers this would make this accommodation hellish. The room we were first in was also significantly more dingy than the one on the outside, with a cigerette covered roof outside the window and little natural light. My friend commented that it reminded her of a prison cell. Another issue was the customer service. Consistently, the blonde woman at the concierge desk was chatting to another blonde staff member and ignoring us even when we went to the desk to pick up brochures. The other woman staff member even gave my friend a nasty look when we approached and, despite my making eye contact with her, didn't acknowledge us in any other way. When we checked in, the man behind the desk said something that implied the room he was giving to us was a rubbish room which should have been our first warning sign for the above. Not a great way to make people feel good about their stay. The staff at the luggage store were significantly more friendly. The bathrooms were okay but the water was boiling even on cool and there was nowhere to put your stuff to keep it try, no stool or surface, just one hook which was only enough for your towels, and they didn't seem to get cleaned often as when things like cups or towels were left in there they stayed there for a long time. The elevators took a long time as 1 of 3 is constantly used as a service elevator.The good: The location of the stay was fantastic, we could walk out to a lot of the landmarks we wanted to see and nip back to have a rest, recharge phone / camera batteries or get changed throughout the day. The price was very reasonable for the location, and the luggage store was very useful. The rooms are pretty small, but we expected this from this type of accommodation and they were clean which is the main thing. The star appeal of this location has to be the rooftop terrace, which has phenomenal views and is a suntrap throughout the day. It was never rowdy or crowded out there, every time we went out whether it was to have a morning coffee or an evening drink (BYOB/food, there's no bar or anything) we always got a seat and there was always a nice vibe.Overall: If you want to the location and rooftop views for a low price, then it might be worth your stay and trying to ensure you get a good room on check-in. Rooms with private bathrooms might be better, but you will have to know your room-mate very well as the in-room toilet / shower isn't very private! If you're a light sleeper or intend to spend a fair amount of time in the room, don't bother, find somewhere else.","Aberdeenshire, United Kingdom","kmtravelli</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aberdeenshire, United Kingdom</strong>",18,2.0

We expected the room to be small after reading the reviews online before booking, so it wasn’t really an issue, but there were other factors which spoilt the stay somewhat.Firstly, the room was very hot despite using the air conditioning unit in an attempt to cool it down. The higher you turned up the unit, the louder it was and it did become extremely loud on the highest setting (which was the only setting that cooled the room).At 7.40am in the morning there was a truck directly outside the hotel pumping water or something of that nature and the noise was unbearable. I understand that there would be noise, being in New York and all, but this was terribly loud and woke us up. Some sort of warning from the hotel would have been appreciated.The toilet was very small and low to the ground, so I would not recommend for those who struggle with back issues etc. The basin was also outside of the bathroom and had a very public toilet look to it (it was stainless steel) and just gave the room more of a budget feel.On a positive note, there were plenty of towels provided, a hairdryer and a small desk and chair.

Easy Airtrain/Subway ride to Lexington and 53rd and a less than 5 minute walk around the corner. Our room (218) was a 'full pod' with built in toilet and shower and as expected based on reviews was small - but with no complaints from us. Having our own bathroom was handy, but with one warning - the toilet door is frosted, but one is very well silhouetted when using it, and the shower curtain needs to be pulled across for a little privacy otherwise having eye contact with your partner whilst going about your business might be a little weird. Some might be OK with this, but personally I'm not into that. Likewise, the shower has a see-through panel which cannot be covered so again, unless very comfortable in providing a show for any other occupant of the room, probably best that one goes around to 2nd Avenue for take-out coffee whilst the other completes the morning routines...unless you have a burning desire to get to know each other MUCH better than you already might!This did not detract however from opinions of the hotel, neither did the rather noisy aircon in the room, which made quite a noise as whether set to cool or completely turned off there was a constant loud hum but seeing as one only really uses the room to sleep it was not too bothersome and being tired after exploring Manhattan it certainly did not prevent sleepLocation-wise, it was perfect for our needs.

Has a bed, small desk and chair, tv, phone, and clock radio. Bathroom had bar soap and shower supplies. Bathroom was really tiny. I would have been happy stealing 5-12"" of space from the stupid closet to make the bathroom more useful for an adult. As it was, the toilet was slanted slighted from the wall to allow one to sit, but you had to step over the toilet to enter the tiny shower. Don't drop the soap - you wont be able to pick it up in the tight quarters. Aircon worked - but was very loud - which is ok - as every room is right on top of each other. Good to drown out the noises from outside the room. This place has the feel of a former SRO apartment building and I'm amazed at the building code that permitted these narrow corridors and minuscule bathroom. I presume it complies with code - but I would hate to be in this hotel if there were ever a fire or other emergency.

Any last minute additions or changes will cost as much as another other local budget hotel. (I had to add an extra night on both ends of my stay and it set me back over 340 bucks) 2) Understand that this place is NOT a ritzy hotel. The best I can describe it is a very high end hostel. I chose to stay here for 8 days while my wife was a patient at Sloan cancer center. I was attracted by the price but worried about some of the reviews. I can tell you that all of the negative reviews here are by people who expect FAR too much from a budget hotel. Pros; Room was super clean. Bed was comfortable, view from the 12th floor corner room was nice. I honestly felt 'at home' in my small room. It was like spending the night at your friends house in their small guest bedroom. Cons: I really cant list any deficiencies with the staff, facilities or property. The hotel does have peculiar perfumed smell too it. I didnt dwell too long on the odors it was covering up. Face it, everything in New York city stinks. With that being said.......Ive spent almost 20 years in the Army and Im used to shared bathrooms and small living spaces. These rooms are small and functional. They aren't claustrophobic, but they arent any bigger than the smallest room in your house or apartment. Secondly......the shared bathrooms.....quite a shock if you weren't expecting it. The bathrooms were always clean and well stocked, but some of you may freak out when you walk into a tiny bathroom/shower thats still all wet and steamy from the previous user. I never had to wait for a bathroom, which amazed me. Overall, this is a great budget hotel to stay in as long as you understand what you are booking. Make your reservations at least 7 days in advance and you will get the best rates in NYC. The rooms are clean and comfortable but very sparse. Shared bathrooms can be intimidating for those who arent expecting it.","Ovid, New York","drunkensoldier</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ovid, New York</strong>",19,4.0

The Pod was cute and well designed, clean and modern. We had a shared bath but there were 4 bathrooms on the floor and a light in the room went on if the bathroom was occupied so you could see when the facility was vacant. The cleaners work hard and do a good job. There is a reasobale cafe in the lobby where you can grab a coffee and a bagel for about $6. We mostly had breakfast over the road at Carol's Cafe in Greenacre Park. I loved the rooftop deck where you could chill out in the sunshine. The hotel do a shuttle service to the airport for $22. If you are travelling with a party of 2 or more then I would say that it is better to get the flat rate yellow taxi service. There is a subway 51st just 2 blocks away and a Duane Reade (like a Tesco Express) just down the road which was handy for snacks etc... I like seeing shows and the walk to Broadway was fine.

Where do I start. Let's start from the beginning. The attitude of the front desk did not respect us as humans being but as objects they can milk money from. No greeting or professionalism whatsoever. When we got to the room, we found out that it does not have any bathroom in it. Something that was rather a surprise since in all my years of hotels in the United states I have never experienced that before. However and regardless this was not at all represented in the pictures of the room. But okay. With that we can live. What we couldn't live with was the LACK OF HANDICAPPED ACCESS inside those pitiful so called bathrooms at pod51. My mother suffers from severe RA and is handicapped and could not squat down to the low level of the toilet nor could even take a shower due to lack of handicapped railing in the shower. The room was dirty and smelled like mold. The bathroom had rust everywhere, holes in the walls and even roaches. Pictures attached. This was like a stay in a horror show.

The hallways are very dark and our queen room rather small, but we really were only there to sleep. The employees were very helpful. There is a rooftop area for sitting. We arrived about 10:00am and were able to check-in early and get our room. We had a late flight leaving, so they held luggage in secure area. The only real downside is the bathroom. The shower is very small and with a large rain shower it is impossible to get out of flow of water. Also, there is light on back wall of shower that is hot if you bump it. The solution to that is turn on light over sink, not overhead bathroom light. The biggest issue is there is no way to completely close bathroom from room. If sliding door is closed toilet covered, but there is clear glass at sink that looks into and out of room. It was just my daughter and I, but could be problem depending on the 2 people in the room.","Lakeland, Florida","57SusanHL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lakeland, Florida</strong>",25,4.0

This is my second time staying in a Pod hotel (I previously stayed at Pod 39) and I was very satisfied with the stay. The room at Pod 51 was much smaller than the room I had at Pod 39, but I was expecting a small room so this did not bother me much. The location is great and so is the price considering the location. My only complaint is the bathroom is SO small, even the shower! You can barely wash your hair without the rainfall shower rinsing it out at the same time- they may have been better off with a regular shower head or making the shower a little bigger. It's also nearly impossible to change in the bathroom because of how small it is. Other than that everything was very clean and we greatly enjoyed our stay. One tip- request a high floor!! We were on the third floor and since the room is small our room was so hot even with the heat completely off (there is no AC in the winter). We wanted to open the window to be able to sleep, but being in Manhattan it was noisy all night so neither of us slept well.","Long Island, New York","jsmith493</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Island, New York</strong>",8,4.0

It’s very clean and comfortable the hotel and rooms (rooms as you might have guessed are a little on the small side-but as everyone says your not really in your room much as your out exploring the amazing NYC). My wife and I found the room totally fine, we only had carry on backpacks with us,no luggage taking up room space). We think the rooms are cool in the way they have laid them out and used every bit of space possible. Rooms are super clean, and warm (stayed in December).we had a queen bed and our own private bathroom, although every single time we walked through the corridors to go to lift we noticed all the shared bathrooms where always available (we poked our heads in to one,to have a quick look while it was vacant and they where spotlessly clean, very spacious and very safe-it’s one toilet and one shower In the one bathroom, so you won’t actually be in there with anyone else, you use your key to open the bathroom door and lock it once in there. Very private! We said we will save a lil money next time and pay for a room with shared bathroom). Found the hotel to be of a complete mixed age range. Young, middle aged, older (70s,80s+), singles, couples, friends, groups. Great vibe!! My only set back from giving it 5 stars is the doors slamming through the night. When people enter or leave their room the doors do make a loud metal bang, I really hope they invest in fixing this as it would easily be a 5 if we didn’t get woke up a few times in the middle of the night in our comfy bed to loud slamming from doors). The best parts - location! Great central spot,5 min walk to Rockefeller center , st Patrick’s, grand terminal etc etc, but it’s quiet away from all the hustle and bustle of Times Square (you’ll appreciate the 5-10min walk at the end of the day to go back and chill from walking all day). One of our highlights of our NYC trip was getting up real early (5.30am) and walking around the corner to ess-a-bagel to grab an amazing filled bagel for breakfast with a cup of coffee.the most tastey filled bagel there is.it was still dark at that time, you get a really cool feel to NYC at that time,it’s more quieter (still bustling tho lol), you’ll see locals heading off early to work,see deliveries coming and going,and after your bagel go for a nice fresh,early morning walk with your coffee around the blocks and take it all in, brilliant). As we went first thing to ess a bagel there where only maybe 10 people in the que, as we walked past later in the afternoon there where ques out the door and down the street, what a total hotspot, for obvious reasons, so if staying at pod51 go grab breakfast early there).. last but no least, is the amazing roof terrace (again go early as no one will be up there). Go up to the top floor on lift and follow the signs up the stairs leading you out to the roof terrace. What amazing views, unreal. We had the place to ourselves (around 9am) for lots of cool photos and to really take in that we where in NYC. We will 100% stay again, looking forward to returning,just hope the door slamming noises gets sorted :) :) 5 stars for location, price, cleanliness, safeness and comfort.","Greater Sydney, Australia","Ross N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greater Sydney, Australia</strong>",10,4.0

If you're expecting anything other than very small then this is not the hotel for you. We had a bunk room and the other people we were with had a queen room. The bunk beds aren't very well suited for tall people, I don't think they're the extra long twin size. We found the mattresses to be comfortable. The shared bathrooms in the hallways make the hallways a little louder than other hotels and there was a gap between the door to our room and the floor, which let in noise. The queen room has just enough space to walk around the bed. The bathroom in the queen room was odd: the sliding door into it was opaque, so not much privacy, and then it also had a window into it, so you could totally look in while someone was sitting on the toilet. I appreciated that there was a small cafe in the lobby to get coffee, light breakfast, wine, etc. I was prepared to have a shared bathroom since we were in a bunk bed room; however, it didn't occur to me that sharing a bathroom might increase the odds of seeing someone partially nude in the hallways--which is what happened. A man was walking to the bathroom in the hallway with nothing on his bottom half. I likely wouldn't stay here again for that reason, it made me feel unsafe.

It's close to the 51st st subway station if you take the 6 train to things, but mainly I just walked. I had a shared bathroom floor and my friend and I had a small room with a bunk bed. It's small but really, for the space they thought of everything. There's individual tv's for each person, cutouts in the wall so each person has plugs and USB power. There's a small airplane-like sink in the room with towel beneath. There's a light above the door that tells you when the bathrooms / showers are occupied. We never ran into issues with people fighting for the showers. There isn't much space on the hook to hang stuff though, so definitely bring flip flips and consider a bathrobe / sweatpants. The shampoo / conditioner / body wash they have in the showers is decent. The other thing is that it's not very well insulated, so you can hear a bunch of hallway noise as people come in or out.

We were on a budget during our trip and chose Pod 51 for it's location and reasonable price. First we booked a double room with private bath but I was worried the room would be too small so we upgraded to a Queen Room with private bath and I am glad we did! The room was small but had everything we needed and rooms for our 2 huge suitcases and carry on bags! Every inch of space in the room is used effectively whether it is built in shelving with plugs by the bed or the top shelves above the closet. The nice thing about our room was that it had an amazing balcony (we were on the 11th floor) so the view was great and having coffee on our balcony each morning was perfect. The rooftop deck is really nice too as well as the cafe for coffee and pastries in the morning. The staff were polite and helpful (especially the concierge!) and the room was cleaned well each day. Highly recommend the attached restaurant, Clinton Hall, as well - great food and atmosphere! Finally, the location! Pod 51 is in a great section of Midtown and in perfect walking distance to So many places. It is also just like 2 blocks away from the subway so getting to other parts of NY was super easy! There weren't many things I didn't like about our stay here however, there were some areas for improvement but these didn't dampen our stay. (1) At check-in we weren't given any info about the hotel at all (e.g. cafe hours, concierge hours, wifi info, floor to access the deck, etc.) - some general info would have been helpful and we wouldn't have had to call the front desk so many times; (2) There is no vending machine for bottled water, soda, snacks, etc. If you want bottled water or snacks for your room there is a Duane Reade Pharmacy and CVS pharmacy just 2 blocks away; (3) Elevators were very slow. There are 3 but one is a service elevator and it seems one was always being used by the hotel staff or something as it would stay on one floor paused so that left one lift for the 14 floor building which made for long waits in mornings.Overall, value for the money especially the week after Thanksgiving in Midtown!

I called the front desk around midnight and they lied, telling me that the music would be shutting down in the next half hour. The light over the bed wasn't working and the room was dim. The clock/radio was unplugged and I soon found out why--none of the controls worked. The attendant at the elevator was surly and unhelpful. If I had been staying more than one night, I'd have raised holy hell. The location was good and the price was low but not low enough to compensate for all the aggravation.

I cannot fault anything about our stay outside of our room. The staff, hotel layout, location, services, decor, atmoshpere and cleanliness were excellent. In fact, for an affordable hotel in Manhattan I do not think that you can do much better than Pod51, especially as because we were there for only four days, we spent no time in the room apart from to sleep.We did have three issues:1. We were woken on two separate nights by people returning back to the hotel later than us (and we got in late!) by extensive talking in the corridor at normal voice volume levels and also by the doors of other rooms closing. The sound proofing of the doors in Pod51 bedrooms is not good enough and the doors should be fitted either with a sound softening seal or a mechanism that slows down the door swinging speed so that it would stop the doors from slamming when closing.2. I am 6ft 2 inches tall and the double bed was too short to sleep in without my feet or head off at one end. Similarly the toilet did not give enough leg room so my feet had to be in the shower to use it when sitting.3. 2 out of the three electric sockets in the room did not work which meant taking turns to charge electric devices/hairdryer etc. which was easy enough to get around but did make it a little bit more difficult.","Solihull, United Kingdom","tbadders</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Solihull, United Kingdom</strong>",1,4.0

Drunk people yelling right outside my open window at 4a. To make it worse, the front desk called my room at 4:30am to say I had a package. I don't care when the package is delivered - unless a guest tells you to call them when it arrives, you don't call up. You slip a note under the door. Not that it was my package anyway. I don't mind minimalist surroundings. I've done airbnb's and hotels of a wide variety across the US and Europe. But minimalist and inexpensive doesn't have to mean cheap (which everything in the room was, in fact, very cheap). To make it worse, the price was only about $25 off from other 3 and 4 star hotels nearby. Just pay the little bit extra and get a real hotel. This place isn't worth it. Only positive is that the front desk staff who helped me check in and out were nice.

On arrival we realised how compact the room was. Having said that everything we needed was catered for. We had en suite facilities and although no wardrobe or other room furniture could be fitted in, there was sufficient hanging space and drawer space for the clothes we had brought with us. Whether this would be adequate for a longer stay, I'm not sure. The small bed was comfortable and both my wife and I, 50 years +, slept well. The room was clean tidy and kept very spic and span by the hotel service team. Reception staff were polite, courteous and helpful with information on the best transport options to the airport at the end of out stay.As our trip was for sight-seeing, we had no need of anything else from our accommodation and it fitted our needs very well. As had been said elsewhere the roof terrace is a real 'pull' for this hotel and the 'downtown' views of the surrounding streets, is fantastic, especially at night. We were disappointed that the garden area next to reception was closed for the duration of our stay. We used the cafe for breakfast. There are a variety of options and while I thought it was good value, the man behind the counter seemed very stressed and struggled to cope with the demand from other guests.To sum up, the accommodation is very compact, but having spoken to fellow travellers, no more than any other local accommodation and you cannot expect anymore if you wish to stay in Manhattan.

I have stayed in Pod 39 and Pod 51, but not yet in the one near Times Square. What do others have to say about that one? I like its location, but worried it might be too noisy, so decided not to stay there. Would appreciate feedback.After staying at Pod 39 for the past several years, mainly because I love how close it is to Grand Central, I saved $400 this time by switching to the Pod 51. That $400 soon evaporated as my Pod 51 room turned out to be a single with shared bathroom, and I opted to upgrade to room (610) with queen bed and private shower/bath. It faced 51st St. The phone and desk chair both were broken when I arrived, but a very nice staffer soon remedied both of those minor problems. Otherwise, the room was fine. It was a bit noisy, as there seems now to be a pretty busy restaurant/nightlife scene between the hotel and 2nd Avenue. I was able to drown out the noise one night by shutting windows and using AC. Sunday night it was much quieter and I could leave the windows open (a rare luxury at a NYC hotel, and one that I value).The bell captain was very nice and helpful, booking my shuttle to return to LGA ($20, ride took 32 minutes). Front desk was a bit chilly. I did not venture into a sports bar adjoining the lobby because, eww. Great water pressure and hot water in the shower. Everything else was fine. The tab, just over $1,200 for for nights, is getting beyond the price of a budget hotel with tiny rooms, and I was told it was because of the craziness in the east '50s due to the U.N. meetings coming up.",Minnesota,"claudeboyd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minnesota</strong>",2,4.0

If you are a light sleeper you might want to wear earplugs, the room itself was quiet but the hallways are very narrow so you'll hear everyone coming & going. If you like modern it is quite modern with a trendy feel (so trendy there aren't even bags in the trash can!), and very clean. There was no breakfast or ice machine or coffeemaker in room. Not all rooms have a view so you should request that if it's important to you. They have 3 elevators but there's always a wait for them. Don't bother asking for late checkout, they will knock on your door anyway. You can't beat the location, everything in terms of transportation, grocery/pharmacy, nightlife, restaurants are within walking distance (also MoMA, Central Park, etc), I put an extra star back for location!

The bathrooms were always available when I needed them and were all very clean. After checking out I realized that above the door, it has a notification section with four toilets and the lights light up when a bathroom becomes available. There is nearby parking. Though after parking several blocks away the front desk gentlemen told me I could park at any icon parking garage and I would get a discount. After parking at an icon garage 10 minutes walking distance away, i learned the hard way that the parking garage I chose was not one of the garages that provides a discount for my hotel.

Pod51 has it all! If you are on a budget but still would like to stay at mid-Manhattan, I highly, strongly, recommend this place. I chanced upon this hotel because the hotel which I was meant to stay, upon checked in, the room which I had paid for, was sold out. You can see my review of Blue Moon Boutique Hotel and avoid staying there. 4 reasons you should stay at this hotel:1) The Pod room of course! Their rooms are designed to make full use of space, very trendy and stylish. The bathroom towels are white and feels so clean. I stayed at the Full Pod room with my private shower. The room is tiny in space but big in all essential amenities. Full bedPrivate bathroom with rainfall showerhead - Awesome shower with good hot water option! The bathroom is so clean with very clean and white towels. Complimentary wireless Internet - Super fast, really good connection. Better than the 5 star hotel I stayed at earlier in the week.Hairdryer - so thankful! Air conditioning - a little noisy Two flat-screen TVs with cable channelsWork desk and chair2) Locationclose to a train line, many small bars around and next to the Pod. 3) Friendly staff4) Clean space and affordable. The only disappointment is that on their website they had advertised a rooftop bar at Pod 51. However, the reality is the rooftop bar is at Pod 39 so that was a little disappointing. And Pod 39 is closer to Macy's hence had I known, I would have book Pod 39 instead. I will definitely stay at Pod hotels the next time I visit NYC and so should you!

If you're looking for a place to sleep and are not big on luxury, then stay here. For the price, quality and location you can't beat it. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. I stayed here while on business. Because it sounds like a hostel style setup, I was expecting the place to be full of young rowdy travelers. It was not. I saw families, young people and business travelers like me. I stayed in a double which was plenty of room. Lots of storage with drawers under the beds to utilize space. Lots of pillows. Beds are comfortable (I prefer a firmer mattress btw). Room is clean and is well maintained. The safe in my room wasn’t working so they sent a maintenance person up to fix…he was there in less that 10 minutes. The bathroom reminds me of a typical European bathroom (aka small). Which was perfect for my stay. The soap/shampoo dispensers in the shower were a nice added bonus. The air conditioner was loud, but I actually like that as it drowned out the street noise (horns, sirens, etc.). If you prefer quiet, bring your ear plugs. I will stay here again on my next trip to NYC.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","Tom S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",41,5.0

Each bed had its own tv and remote, a light, a recess with an outlet to hold phone, glasses, etc. And there was a sink in the room with a mirror.The major problem was the window air conditioner. It was so noisy that we turned it off, then suffocated from the lack of ventilation.The hotel also offers free walking tours, a concierge service, and a small coffee bar.

It’s in a great location surrounded by restaurants and bars. Easy to walk to business meetings in midtown.

There is only one USB port and it’s by the desk not the bed. The clock radio only supports an iPhone4. The hallways seem darker and the elevators slower. I also didn’t find the service to be as welcoming as in the past. Very unfriendly and distracted front desk staff. Frankly, I’m not sure I would stay again despite having been a fan for years. There is more competition for this sort of hotel these days in NY and Pod51 needs to step up to compete. I used to enthusiastically recommend this hotel to friends and business colleagues but will no longer do so.

Recently stayed here 1 night while in town for business. Not my first time at this property and have stayed at other PODS in NYC. You need to know what you are getting... clean comfortable, no frills, inexpensive place to sleep in a very convenient location. If you are looking for Tons of Space... or staying for an extended period of time... not sure this is what you are looking for. I stayed in a Queen Room by myself for 1 night. I contacted the property ahead of time and inquired about an early check-in (1:30 pm as opposed to 3p) and they were very accommodating. Room was very clean but it did have one of the smaller bathrooms I had seen (Room 520). Other rooms had a bit more space in the bathroom.... but for a night or two on a budget... No Problem. They have a snack bar in the lobby...which btw is always Very clean and Very well lit. There is also the Roof Top Bar but I have been to this property twice and have not had time to visit it. There is also a bar right off the lobby with an interior entrance. The bartending staff might be the nicest I have encountered in my time going to a bar. I hung out for 2 pints and a snack from their bar menu before meeting some coworkers. This bar also had an Old School Bubble Hockey Game (USA vs USSR) - loved this growing up and wished there was someone around to play. :) This POD also has a comfortable lounge in the lobby with a foosball table. Overall Very Inviting and the Staff Was Beyond Pleasant. This has become my good to place in NYC. Under $200 for a night on 51st St and Lex?

Felt like an economy cruise-ship cabin. Room was possibly as small as my smallest bedroom at home, with a combo shower/toilet. Toiletries in pump dispenser on shower wall. Captain's bed (twin) that had drawers underneath in place of a dresser. Surprised that the room included a teeny little desk and mid-century modern wire chair - nice touch. The elevators have piped-in music. Club like. The hallways are dark - didn't like that aspect. LOVED the rooftop patio - great views and you really know you're in the city when you're surrounded by all the other towers. Perfect selfie opportunity. Midtown location smack in the middle of everything else. Walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Saks, St. Patrick's, as well as Grand Central Station if you're feeling ambitious. Subway station close by, and also close to stops for the 2nd and 3rd Avenue buses. Made getting around town a breeze. I got injured during the trip - was obviously limping and in pain - staff didn't seem too concerned, so in that case, they lived down to the stereotype of the uncaring New Yorker. Also didn't care for the varying rates on billing the room depending on the day of the week - seemed that the booking service didn't mention that when I originally made my reservation. However, the convenience of the location outweighed my concerns. Will this be my first choice hotel when I return to the city? No, but if I have no alternative and they have openings, I'd stay there again. Pity that Salvation Burger, right next door to them, closed.

Very nice.It was obviously very cold in mid Feb’ so I only paid a brief visit to the roof-top terrace but it looks like it would be a perfect place to hang out during the summer. Very funky. Very New York.I was staying on my own and one of the real plus points for me was the relaxing vibe in the dining area on the ground floor. You could buy a bagel or muffin and some fruit with a decent coffee in the morning for about $15. Not cheap but nothing is cheap….Its New York…ha ha. The dining area was also a cool place for me to kick-back with a beer in the evening before I headed out. They had a decent choice of beers and plenty of ports to re-charge your phone. Also a very helpful and knowledgeable concierge was always on hand with free maps and advice about the best way to get around and the best places to see.Also if you are staying for a few days I can highly recommend the Indian restaurant Amma which is right next door. I visited 3 times while I was there and tasted some of their very best Indian dishes. The staff were lovely and even though I was on my own I wasn’t made to feel the slightest bit uncomfortable or hurried. Highly recommended.The location of the Pod was also another big plus. It’s a few blocks away from the heart of New York but close enough to a couple of Subway stations so all of the sights of New York are within easy reach.I will definitely use Pod 51 as a base to explore New York if I ever return. ,Gibraltar,"merrydave</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gibraltar</strong>",32,5.0

I was travelling by myself with my own money to a conference, so I wanted an inexpensive place close to the conference location.I reserved a room with a single bed, shower, and toilet. Some rooms have shared bathrooms. The room was great. They come across as sort of a hip boutique hotel so the spartan fittings work well. Everything was clean and the staff was professional.The hotel attracts budget travellers and on my first night there it sounded like some young party types were in the mood to be really noisy. After a while I heard someone come ask them to be quiet and they did. Other than that I had no issues. The doors are very thin so you hear other doors slamming. There was also a party going on in a nearby bar that was loud, but it didn't bother me. I think people who are overly sensitive to noise may not like it here. I have pretty normal tolerances to being annoyed and it was fine.The shower was really good. It had a big overhead shower head and was way above average for a hotel shower.I reserved on their website and got a couple of glasses of wine as a result. That was nice too. They held my luggage for me on my last day. The room was made up every day nicely.This place might not be the best for business travellers. There is no iron or ironing board in the room although I suspect you could borrow one. There's not a lot of space to do any ironing anyway.I think it's perfect for my situation.

It was one of the best value options we found. You could go anywhere by foot (knowing of course that Manhattan is huge and it means that you will daily walk a lot haha). We arrived around 9 am in the hotel and they said that we could check in early because there were rooms available and it would not have an extra cost. The first room we were offered though was really weird, once the bathroom had a strange layout and you could not sit in the toilet without having your knees to touch a corner in the wall - the shower also had a low pressure, so we asked them to change rooms (our request was promptly attended, no issues). The second one was fine but I feel like I need to give you a ""heads up"" about the bathroom... Our shower had a totally transparent glass wall, which in our case was fine, but if you're not traveling with your partner and ask for a double room it can be very awkward. The bathroom door was also an issue, once it sealed the toilet space and it was not totally closing, so we had to use a bag to ""seal it"" and make who was inside more confortable. The bed was okay and there was a sink outside the bathroom, which worked fine for us. The room is very small (NY reality), but we could make it work. A nice thing was that we ordered some things online and by the end of the day, when we got to the room the deliveries were there waiting for us already without any additional fee. It's important to mention though that in case your deliveries arrive before you check in, they're gonna charge you USD 25 per package.

The entrance is very deceiving, it gives the impression of a hip & modern hotel as described but then you get in the lift and it takes a drastic turn. We stayed on the third floor which seemed pretty full, i only know this because i could hear everyone in their rooms very clearly! Paper thin is an understatement. The corridor is dimly lit and narrow and it struck me as a breeding ground for your average serial killer. On entering the room itself you only need to take two steps to reach the end and a quarter then to touch the bathroom, touch the bed and touch the desk all at once. Now i know the manager will say , its New York they're all small but this really is bordering on the ridiculous if there's more than just yourself. The decor is very basic and you get no luxuries like a kettle but that is what is advertised. However the price it charges is so overpriced for what is simply a dank hostel! The sheets and pillows smell of stale bodies and the view is diabolical, a broken roof covered in rubbish! I would suggest getting some cheap astro turf and a cheap plastic dog to make it more aesthetically pleasing.

We usually opt for shared WC in Europe, so the concept wasn't new. And just like there, it's no big deal to slip on your flip flops and walk a few doors down.

They had the bed flipped so you had to sleep horizontal rather than vertically, and your head or pillows were falling off the side of the bed.

We stayed on the 8th floor which has 4 shared bathrooms and we never had to wait to use the bathrooms at all. The bathrooms have secure locks so you feel safe that you won't be disturbed.In fact, having the shared bathrooms was a positive as it meant we could both get ready for the day at the same time and didn't have to wait for each other to finish.

I choose Pod 51 because at the time it was the highest reviewed hotel at the $200 price range. I scanned some of the reviews and the ones I read were all gushing. What I didn’t realize was the bathroom is shared and it is shared by the entire floor of twenty rooms or so. There are only two bathrooms per floor from what I saw on the 14th floor where I stayed. Because I paid $200 for the room I find this ridiculous. I also noticed when I checked in the same room could be booked for $79. I feel totally hoodwinked. The staff are friendly, the location is excellent near Rockefeller center but the rooms are so tiny and the bathroom situation unbearable. If I was single and on a low budget and could get the room for $80 then I would be happy. But I am way past the age where I need to share a bathroom with a whole floor of people. The worst part is that for $200 I could have gotten a private bathroom at another hotel. I think the reviews here are good because budget travelers who actually got a budget rate get good value. Do not pay a premium rate and be prepared to rough it. The bathroom is so small and there is not even a counter to set your clothes or toiletries on.

(If you don't want the city noise, it's quiet with the windows closed.) 3. Great restaurants within steps of the hotel! (Amma - fine Indian dining; Le Bateau Ivre - wine bar/French; Stag's Head - pub food with great selection of beers and ciders). There are only two small things that prevented this from being a solid 5-star experience: 1. No washcloths. It's really hard to scrub off makeup or dirt without a washcloth. I wound up using a hand towel for this purpose. 2. No magnified mirror. This is a really common feature in hotels these days, and it would have been nice to have.

Previously I've stayed in a bunk with shard bathroom and a single with shared bathroom.On this occasion I booked a double with private bathroom and for me it worked great. The only thing to be aware of is there isn't a great deal of privacy if your not traveling alone. The shower is separated from the main room by a shower curtain and frosted glass door. Also, the toilet just by the frosted glass door. Another thing, the bed is sideways and doesn't have a headboard. It's a weird little setup but guess it makes the most of a small space. Be aware it is a small room but this is as cheap a hotel as you are going to get in Manhattan... and that is why.On my 3 stays, dating back to 2013, the hotel has always been clean and really hasn't shown any sign of ageing.

At $155 per night for a room in Midtown Manhattan, it is indeed a very good deal. The hotel is not far from a subway and many attractions in Manhattan.The room itself is tiny. There is a desk, a small bed with a very hard and unpleasant mattress and a sink. My biggest issue with the room was the noise. My room was on the second floor, and right outside my window (with no view) there were a number of AC units which I assume contributed to the constant noise that was impossible to get rid of. The TV was okay, and there was Wi-Fi, but otherwise not much in term of amenities. The room rate promised red wine at check in, but I didn't see any of that. There is no restaurant or anything on site either. You are getting a very no-frills experience. The room had four shared bathrooms. One of them, with a shower, had literally no space for placing your clothing. I'm not sure what they were thinking. That their guests would walk around naked in the public hallways? The shared bathrooms were generally pretty small and not very pleasant.

I booked the single pod with shared washrooms. My tldr review: staying here is a compromise between price, room size, and location. Pods and washrooms were clean. Price is much cheaper than other Manhattan hotels; I also booked two months in advance. The pod is much smaller than a regular hotel room. Location is fantastic. Would stay again.(I didn't use the lobby cafe or patio.)ROOM: The pod is very small, only meant as a place to sleep. Room includes sink, mirror, towels, tv and desk. Room was clean, housekeeping was good. The air conditioner can be quite loud, but as I sleep best with white noise I did not mind it at all. Two complaints: 1) Mattress is too firm for my tastes. 2) Poor sound isolation between the room and the hallway. The sound of the door closing is very loud, and sometimes I was awoken by the loud slam of doors down the hallway very late at night.WASHROOM: There four washrooms per floor. There are lights in the room to indicate when a washroom is being used. Shampoo, conditioner and body wash is provided in the washrooms. Washrooms were quite busy during morning and evening hours. They were clean for the most part, even with the heavy use during the long weekend. However the floor can get wet after showering as there is no shower mat or floor drain. In one washroom the previous user laid down tissue paper to soak the water, but it just turned into a soggy mess. Definitely recommend wearing shower flip flops. I would also recommend checking out each washroom as they all have different layouts, and some are more spacious than others.LOCATION: Within walking distance to UN Plaza, St. Paul’s cathedral, Rockefeller Plaza, Grand Central Station, and Times Square. At night the area is quiet (but not sketchy). There are two nearby subway stations serving multiple subway lines. Steps away from the hotel there is a bagel shop that seems to be a major destination for locals and tourists alike – although the line was always an hour long when I went out for breakfast.","Toronto, Canada","Roseanne S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",1,4.0

You defiantly get what you pay for. We booked a double room with a private bathroom and the room was tiny. Suitable for one person. Not big enough for two people and luggage. Our first night in the hotel was just the worst night we've had. The room was very warm, we couldn't put the air con because it was so noisy. The noise from the street was unbearable and there was a constant noise from the main air con unit what supplies the hotel. Then to top it off our room was next to the communal bathroom which was in constant use all night with the doors being slammed. It got to the point when we realised we wasn't going to get any sleep so I went to reception to ask if we could be moved to a room towards the back of the hotel. The receptionist wasn't much help, he just said he couldn't do anything and he came to check the noise in our room and just said that's the noise so you will have to deal with it. So after a sleepless night we went to ask again at the reception and this time a different receptionist was very helpful. He gave us two rooms to go and have a look at to see which one we thought would be better. We chose 702. It was the same size room but the noise levels were considerably lower and we managed to get a good sleep. So overall it is a budget hotel, don't expect anything amazing from it. The location is good for all the main attractions. ",,foodforme85,4,2.0

The room was very small, but well designed and it had everything I needed. There were plenty of outlets in the room for charging devices. The full bathroom was definitely compact, but again, everything I would expect from a more luxurious hotel was there, which was good because this place isn't cheap, even though it is on the more budget end for NYC.The space was very tight. I'm one person, and very average sized. If I had been traveling with my partner, who is 6'3"", I suspect there could have been a lot of issues, particularly with the bed and shower stall.I had read other reviews that mentioned that the walls were super thin so noise was a real problem, so I was concerned, but that turned out to not be an issue. I rarely heard my neighbors. The hotel staff were fantastic. The little cafe in the lobby was great for grabbing a quick breakfast in the morning. The seating areas were comfortable, with both indoor and outdoor seating.The hotel offers ""Podwalks"" Monday through Friday, where they have a tour guide from a local tour company do a walking tour that takes most of the morning. I did the Thursday tour, which is Chelsea Market/Meatpacking District/Greenwich Village and it was excellent. The tours are free, though I did tip my guide generously at the end.The hotel itself is very colorful and fun. There is music piped in all the elevators, and the entire hotel is very artsy. The rooftop deck is nice, though the building is significantly smaller than other buildings in Midtown, so it isn't a great view for sightseeing. But it is a lovely space to hang out and enjoy a glass of wine.The hotel also offers a $40 flat rate car service to the airport, which I found more convenient, quicker, and cheaper than the taxi I arrived in.The only complaint I have is that it was unseasonably hot when I was there and the air conditioner in my room wasn't the greatest. It did work, but not exceptionally well.

Felt like sleeping inside the engine of a jet plane. And I had to turn it on constantly, because I couldn't open the window.3. When I asked to borrow a plastic bowl so I could hand wash some clothes, they said they didn't have one. I think that a hotel which presents itself as a budget hotel should have this option.4. There was no shared fridge - also something I think a budget hotel should have.5.

The staff was very accommodating and friendly. The rooftop had a great view of the city, but they did not have a bar up there like I thought so bring your own drinks! My only issue with this hotel was the bathroom situation. I got a room with one full bed and a ""private"" bathroom (They had a shared bathroom with about 4 other rooms for cheaper). We paid extra for the private bathroom, but they only had one sliding glass door to cover the toilet AND the shower. So to take a shower you would have to cover the toilet side to unchange, then do an awkward shimmey into the shower while sliding the glass door to the other side so you wouldn't flash your roommates. A simple second curtain or door would have fixed this issue!

It was like two smaller rooms put together plus some space! Two tvs and two desks and our own bath. The rooms are clean, chic and comfy. I love the shower stalls and high pressure showers. The locations is great - not too touristy - not too residential. With the Morning Star Cafe a half a block one way and Ess-a-Bage the other way - how can you go wrong. Two metro stations are very conveniently located. If you exit the hotel and walk left for five blocks you have St. Patricks on your left, Rockafeller Center right in front of you!

I rented a single room. I had a twin bed (mediocre comfort level) clean sheets and towels, IKEA desk and chair, and an airplane size sink. I would estimate my room was about 50 square feet. THIS WAS FINE! The room was great, clean, good smell, nice TV. Only complaint in the room would be that the actual door to my room was quite THIN, more of a bedroom door, than a hotel door. made me a bit uncomfortable since my head was 3 feet from it while sleeping.My issue is the community bathroom. the positive: LIGHTS illuminate above your hotel door when community restrooms are occupied. This is nice in that you do not have to make multiple trips to busy restrooms to relieve yourself or get clean. the negative(S): So, the community water closets are the size of a ... water closet, in your home. EXTREMENLY SMALL. which is fine, however if I were overweight, I would not be able get in, and close the door... The issue is that they are NOT designed for multiple person or continuous use. there is NOTHING to sanitize between uses, or even control SMELL (just being real). and the showers with cloth curtains allow water to spread across the tile floor in the small restroom, with no drain, no towels, so its impossible to even clean after yourself, upon leaving. These community restrooms are a fine idea, but at $165 on a friday night... You better have it clean for me. its not a youth hostel pricepoint. The idea is a great one,but they have alot of work to do to make the financial commitment match the minimal amenities. P>S> I would NEVER stay here as a couple, or two to a room. just. too. small.

I struggled over the rating because there are things about this hotel that are really good, and some that are really not. I decide to split the baby and go with average.First of all, Pod 51 will not be for everyone. It worked well for us because when we travel, our hotel serves as a place to sleep, change, and shower. We don’t hang out at the hotel or entertain in our room. That means that we don’t need a large room or tons of amenities, we’d rather go small and simpler and pay less. Other reviews complain about the postage-stamp size room (I would estimate the main area of the room to be around 100 – 120 square feet), but that’s what a pod hotel is. There were a few amenities that we would have liked, but we did fine without them and preferred the lower cost. Things sacrificed in the name of space and cost include: a refrigerator, microwave, alarm clock (I always use my phone anyway), ironing board and iron, and maybe another thing or two that I’m forgetting. But again, I’d rather not pay more for those.Here’s the good stuff. Even though the room is very small, the space utilization is pretty efficient. There are drawers in the platform bed, a couple of small shelves, and a small but functional desk. There is also a small alcove closet with no door (a smart move, it makes the space more usable). One complaint I always have about hotels is that you have to turn on every light in the room (usually six or so) and it’s still dark. Being small, the overhead ceiling light provides ample light. There are also two bedside lights and the natural light from the windows is great. The room is very modern, with a hip, industrial-minimalist feel to it. There is a nice area downstairs to hang out if you need some space, with a garden patio and rooftop seating, so if the pod starts feeling claustrophobic, you have a place to go. The hotel is very conveniently located, there are subway stations nearby, plenty of decent restaurants and bars, a good bagel place, a pharmacy, and plenty of retail in the area. It’s an easy walk to Grand Central Terminal, Times Square, and other stuff. With the subway so close, nothing is too far away. The staff is friendly and helpful, the concierge was able to give us good directions and advice.We had a room with a private bath (I’m way beyond my communal bathroom days). While small, the bathroom was functional enough (I’ll say more later) and they provide shampoo in the little bottles even though they have the dispensers with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner in the shower—I hate those so I appreciated the bottles and bar soap being there without having to ask. Due to the limited space, the faucet and spout is wall mounted with a gooseneck; this is great because you don’t have to stick your hands into the sink to use the water. I wish more hotels would do this.The free wi-fi worked well and was fast. The room itself, despite its size is quire comfortable. The A/C worked well, the beds were comfortable, and while there was a bit of noise from doors opening and closing (more than normal due to the community bathrooms in the halls) the place was quiet, not much street noise. Overall, Pod 51 served us well.But… there were some negatives as well. Most of these are minor, but some are a bit more significant. First is that while I understand that it’s a pod and it will have a pod bathroom, it is VERY small. My wife and I are not very big, and we were cramped in that bathroom. Seriously, if you are a large person, the bathroom could be an issue. Excuse the visual, but if you’re on the commode, your knees may be pressed against the door. The shower is miniscule, I was constantly banging my arms against the tile while soaping up and rinsing off. There is a light that juts out from the wall at elbow height that I kept knocking with my elbow. Luckily I’m fairly short or I’d hit my head on the rain style showerhead (the showerhead is actually pretty nice). The stainless steel counter has little room to keep your toiletries and such, and if you leave then there, they’re going to get wet. One amenity that I missed was that they don’t give you washcloths, just hand and bath towels. There is only one hook to hang a towel and it’s really for a place to put your towel so you can grab it after a shower. Your hand towels have to sit on the counter where they’ll get wet, there’s nowhere to hang wet towels.Now this one I can’t figure out. The bathroom door is a frosted glass sliding door, barn door style. When you close the door, the part of the wall between the bedroom and bathroom that get exposed has a window—not frosted glass or some sort of privacy glass—clear glass. Yes, there’s a clear glass window that puts the person in the bathroom on stage. So, you can either keep the door open, or let people see what’s going on through the window. Bottom line is that there is NO privacy in the bathroom. WHAT were they thinking??At first, when we closed the bathroom door, it would just slide back open. If you were on the commode (again, sorry for the visual), you had to hold the door closed with your hands or foot. This leads to another problem, we left the next morning and asked to have someone fix the door. Upon our return late afternoon, nobody had come to fix it. I called and they said that someone would be right up. We wanted to shower, but held off because he was supposedly on his way. Over an hour later, he came. The maintenance guy fixed it in less than a minute. It shouldn’t have taken two calls, and “right up” is not an hour.Quite frankly, housekeeping could have been better. The first day, they didn’t dispose of the used plastic cups, replace the shampoo bottles, or empty the “ice bucket” (more on that in a second). When we checked in, there was a spare roll of toilet paper, the next day it was gone, never to be replaced. The room was basically clean, but not replenished. The next day they did bring additional shampoo, however, we had to wipe off the faucet because residual cleanser was on it—they didn’t wipe it off well.Here’s one of my biggest complaints: they do not give you ice buckets because there is no ice machine. You have to ask for ice from the coffee kiosk attached to the restaurant for ice. If you need ice after 10:00pm closing, it appears you’re out of luck. When you request ice, they will only give you a little disposable container about the size of a quart container you’d get filled with potato salad from the deli. The use full size cubes instead of crushed ice, so you don’t get a lot in the container. It is a battle-royal for them to give you more. Complaining to the front desk just gets you the information that the coffee kiosk is separate from the hotel and they have no control over it. Even the worst fleabag motel has an ice machine. This is one missing amenity that is not excusable. It is irrelevant to me who manages what. You should be able to get as much ice as you need 24/7. My first fit yielded me a stainless steel wine bottle holder of ice, which was OK, but not being an ice bucket, it melted quickly. Not a huge problem if you can go to the machine and get more, but obviously that’s not an option.I know this was a long review, but there was a lot to talk about. Would I stay again at Pod 51, perhaps. But I’d probably check around before making a decision.","Sacramento, California","Valleyblue</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, California</strong>",83,3.0

Bed mostly comfortable. Small TV but fine for my purposes. Quite cost-effective for mid-town. Be prepared to walk. While this hotel is on 51st St, it is pretty far over on the east side, almost to 2d Avenue, so if you need to go over to Broadway or 6th Avenue, it is a but of a hike. It is also a hike from Penn Station, but not so much from Grand Central. I only had two complaints. First, the security seemed a little loose. It seemed that anyone could come in the front door and go right up on the elevator to any floor. This could be easily fixed by having someone attentive right at the elevator to deter outsiders. Second, the sink was aligned on a wall in the main room, but was not very deep front to back, and as a result, water kept splashing on the floor, which was carpeted. That was a bit distasteful when you think about the number of times that must occur, day after day. If you want to spend $50 more a night, you can move up into the hotels with regular size rooms, but this is a pretty decent alternative for those on a budget who don't need to spread out.","Annapolis, Maryland","Martin201564</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Annapolis, Maryland</strong>",7,4.0

But this hotel does it reasonably well and in a funky and friendly way.The room itself is incredibly compact. I had a single room which I described to my family as being like student accommodation - you had a single bed, desk,small cupboard, sink/mirror and a side unit and that is it. If I wanted both my bags out they were on my bed or floor as there was only room for one to be out at a time. The room doesn't have a clock radio or a hook to hang your towel on but does provide everything else. the bed is on the firm side but was reasonably comfortable.the rooms aren't well soundproofed from the corridor noise - I never heard noise from my neighbors rooms but I did hear doors banging and any louder conversations in the corridor. normally not a problem except when a couple had a domestic at 2am.The compromise to get this price was a shared bathroom and its condition really depends on who you are sharing the floor with. I found it mostly OK, except that I had to double check the seat and floor in front of the seat was clean every single time (as men leave residue on the floor) which was a pain in the middle of the night but part of the deal.

There are 4 on each floor and I never had an issue getting access to one of the two nearest my room - tip - there is a set of lights over your door to show when they are in use!The staff were a bit aloof for my liking - they did their job well enough but I didn't find any effusive, extremely friendly service in my stay and certainly no friendly greeting as you came in or left (in fact one of the staff roused on a poor girl for not having cash to pay for the shuttle service - who doesn't accept cards these days!).The hotel does try to provide some nice shared spaces so that you can relax. there is a lounge near the reception area and a garden area beside this. there is also a roof top area that you access by travelling to the 14th floor then walking up 2 flights of fire stairs - it is an effort but the view is fabulous!there is a cafe on site that is run by the adjoining cafe however the offerings are expensive and limited - in fact you pay a $1-2 premium compared to that cafe, or nearby businesses. you are better off walking to the end of the street to the Market on 2nd st or cafe's on 3rd or Lexington and either eat there or bring it back to the lounge area.","Canberra, Australia","Tania S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",26,4.0

Check-in was smooth, very pleasant staff, super clean rooms and a prime location in midtown. For the price we definitely feel we got good value. My main feedback for the hotel would be design, design design! My husband and I knew the rooms would be on the small side, but we both agreed that a few changes to the room could have improved the experience immensely. For example we found the oversized bedframe to be quite unnecessary in such a small space and we kept smacking our shins on it on the way to the bathroom. The ledge at the head of the bed was also a bit weird - I wouldn't be surprised to hear a lot of people bonked their heads on that. Why not get rid of it? The wooden shutters on the window with the AC unit wouldn't close, so they stuck way into the room and my husband found it annoying. Replace those things with some sleek panel blinds and you're golden!

We got great weather during our stay we were able to take advantage of the rooftop patio. The location of the hotel is also ideal. It is centrally located in Midtown away from the busyness of the tourist areas but only a 20 minute walk to Times Square and the theaters and a couple blocks from the 6 subway line. One additional perk is the free guided tours you can take via Streetwise NY. These are great tours of specific parts of the city. We took 2 of the tours and loved them!

The location is perfect. They store/hold your luggage before checking in or out. The negatives: It was like sleeping in an MRI machine. You could sit on the bed and touch the shower, toilet and sink. When you showered the entire room filled with steam and condensation. There was no privacy in using either the toilet or the shower. (I'm not a prude, but there are some things I like to keep a mystery in my marriage...like the face I make when I'm pooping.) We stayed on the second floor, and all day we heard music coming from either another room or the restaurant downstairs. At 8am every morning, housekeeping would start knocking on people's doors to clean, and even though our room wasn't being cleaned, we heard everyone elses get cleaned. I have multiple bruises on my shins from repeatedly bumping into the bed. There wasn't room for two suitcases, only one. There was construction happening on their roof, so we heard that all day and weren't able to make use of the patio.If you find a good deal, like under $100 a night, then it's worth staying. If you're traveling alone, or you're young and just don't care, this is a great option.

It is in a great location. One block east has tons of restaurants--from expensive to reasonable. A few blocks north is Bloomingdale's. And we were within an easy 15-20 minute walk to Times Square which we did each of the three nights we were there. The hotel itself is clean, contemporary, and comfortable. We got exactly what they said we would get. I opted for the room with a bunk bed. We had a small sink with a mirror and window and the bathroom was in the hallway. Above the door are lights to tell you when the bathrooms are available. We never had to wait and the bathrooms were clean and well-appointed. The room was tiny--like an interior room on a cruise ship--but the beds and linens were comfortable. Each bed had its own light and tiny flat screen TV. We did see other rooms that looked larger and had their own bathrooms. Our air conditioner wasn't working well. When I called the desk, maintenance was there within 15 minutes with a window unit that worked great. I would definitely stay here again.

Good size and sturdy looking safe in room.

I don't think my room, with a private bathroom and full sized bed, was a good deal. The bunk bed rooms with a shared (outside of room) bathroom are a much better deal. Depending on the time of year, that kind of room costs as little as $75 a night. However, if you don't want to get dressed to walk down a poorly lit hallway to make a 2 a.m. trip to the bathroom, or own shower slippers, upgrading to a room with a private bathroom will cost substantially more money, and is not worth it. Check TripAdvisor--a room in a Hilton Garden Inn with a queen or even a king sized bed could be had a for only a few dollars more and they throw in free wifi and free breakfast. There is no free breakfast option at Pod51. You can go next door to Salvation Burger and pay $4.00 for a bagel or walk a few blocks down 3rd Avenue to eat at Ess a Bagel or Starbucks. Additionally, although the neighborhood is nice, the selection of subways is limited. The M train does not run on the weekends, the 6 train is an unreliable local, and the E train is constantly being rerouted due to Hurricane Sandy repairs. Something to think about when picking a hotel for sightseeing.On the plus side, the service was good (although my ""free glasses of wine"" never materialized, and I was originally given the keys to an occupied room) and the hotel was spotlessly clean.

The first two nights were at the new Marriott Fairfield Inn at 58th and 10th as the rates were $118 and $154 for the first two nights. However, a combination of Christmas and some event raised rates to over $400 at almost all of the chain hotels. I had researched POD 51 and their rate was $126 for two nights. As usual I will list the PROS and CONS:1. Value. $126 vs. $400 no brainer provided you are one person and only plan to sleep there. If a Marriott or other chain was $150-$175 I would stay there instead.2. Quiet. Location is on 51st street between 2nd and 3rd Avenue. I requested and received an inside room and never heard a thing except when people shut their doors in the a.m..3. Location. Easy walking to most things and Metro is at 53rd and Lexington (E train) which goes right to JFK.CONS:1. Incredibly small rooms even by New York Standards. Bare bones basic, though the tiny TV mounted on the wall received a very clear picture. 2. I had a ""full size"" bed which was a bigger than a single and smaller than a double.In summary, if you are one person, only plan on sleeping there and other hotels are much more expensive this is a good choice. If you are a couple and/or plan on spending considerable time in the room you might consider another venue.One tip, Ess-A-Bagel is right around the corner on 3rd Avenue.

There was a guy complaining at the front desk about how small his room was and the desk said, 'yes, the rooms are small'. It was a perfect answer. And this guest just didn't get the vibe.

This time was a solo trip in a single room with shared bathroom. As with my previous stay everything was as expected, nothing fancy but clean and well presented... pretty much what you'd expect at the budget end of the Manhattan hotel market. If anything I was pleasantly surprised with the size of my Pod, much bigger than the previous twin I'd been in.Previously I'd noted that there was very few limited power sockets, that wasn't an issue this time. Also, your room comes with small sink, safe, basic toiletries, hair dryer and TV.Shared bathrooms might be an issue for some but they are always clean and during an 11 night stay I only once had a short wait for a bathroom to become available. I was on floor 14 and there was only two shared bathrooms on that floor. I know on other floors there is up to 4. One minor thing in the bathrooms, it wouldn't hurt to have an extra hook on the wall/door to keep things off the floor.Location is good for getting around Manhattan by subway and Times Square, Rockerfeller centre and Central Park are within comfortable walking distance. And it's really easy getting to and from JFK with subway (direct line from Airtrain and cost just under $8).There are a number of small eateries/bars on 51st and just around the corner and also Duanne Reade just block away (right next to subway), handy for drinks, snacks etc.On this occasion I didn't take advantage of the free tours the hotel put on but have previously.

The hotel is only a 2 minute walk from Lexington subway station and was very easy to find with the help of google maps. Upon entering the hotel there was some quite music playing in the reception and the whole atmosphere was very relaxed. The gentleman on reception was very nice and after taking my credit card information gave me my key with no fuss and told me what floor my room was on.First of all the lifts are very slow and have a mind of their own. Allow a few extra minutes if you are in a rush as they do like to take their time however this is only a minor issue. The room itself was very small however the whole premise of this hotel is compartmental living so it was to be expected. As it was just me staying in the room the bed was only just a bit bigger than your standard single (i believe in the US this is called a twin) however it was comfy enough for me. The tv in the room did make this odd buzzing noise when the sound was turned up to an audible level but it wasn't too bad.The communal, shared, bathrooms were very clean and easily accessible. You didn't have to wait at all to use them and in your room you have a little display above the door that tells you when they are engaged to save you a trip. The Hotel itself is geographically a short walk from all the action in times square and there are plenty of taxis nearby to get you there faster. Make sure you know the address of the hotel as some taxi drivers don't know the hotel,to avoid this i used Uber for the majority of my trip.Overall this is a very nice hotel with a fantastic location, great for the budget traveler.","Manchester, United Kingdom","Nadia L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",5,5.0

The bathroom was miniscule but stylish, and it serves its purpose: there's a small shower, a toilet, a tiny sink and mirror. What more do you need? There is a place to get a simple breakfast in the morning. It is on a quiet street, and the windows have shutters that really block out the light. It is really quite inexpensive, especially for NYC. It would probably feel pretty small for more than one person with luggage for more than a day or two, but to be able to stay for a reasonable price in NY, it would be worth it.

But the two Pod hotels are a not-so-secret third option for travelers that don't want to blow their budget on a bed for the night (or stay at a chain motel on the flyway path for JFK). After Hotel17 cancelled my reservation with no explanation and only a few days' notice, I scrambled to find a comparatively priced (under $200/night) room. A friend recommended Pod51 in Midtown, and I was lucky to get a ""single pod"" room at the last minute. The room was bright, clean, and West Elm/IKEA chic, with all the necessaries packed stylishly into a very small space. (As a former Manhattan studio apartment dweller, I'm used to snug quarters.) Comfortable bed with storage drawers underneath, useful little desk, sink and mirror, plenty of towels, open closet, wall TV, plenty of outlets. There's a separate clean, private toilet/shower room for every few hotel rooms, for those (like my single room) that don't include an in-room bathroom. (Each bathroom has a lock and is used by only one person at a time, so while the bathrooms are technically ""shared"" there won't be anyone but you inside when you're using them.) The busy, slightly scruffy cafe/lounge downstairs offers good croissants, coffee, and other breakfast/snack basics. Clientele was all kinds of people--older, younger, both foreign and American. Definitely not just a 20-somethings hostel. CAVEAT: if you're on a hallway w/ shared bathrooms, bring earplugs! The door to my room had a wide opening at the bottom, so I could hear the loud, metallic clanging of the bathroom doors opening and closing down the hall throughout the night.

The sink and toilet area were as big as an airplane bathroom. I'm a petite woman and found myself uncomfortably close to the shower walls many times. The rain-head shower was not as luxurious as I thought mainly because you were either directly under the water or inches away from the shower walls. Regardless, the water was always hot and had good pressure. Our room didn't come with wash cloths and when we asked for some, we were told they didn't have any as they run out of them quickly. The bed was clean and comfortable and we only had one night where our neighbors down the hall were having a loud argument that could be heard clearly in our room. We stayed on the 7th floor and hardly heard any street noise despite being in the city. LOCATION:The hotel is walking distance (less than 5 minutes) to 2 subway stations.

We arrived at about 3PM so we were able to check in straight away. We had a bunk bed room on the 8th floor. Staff were very friendly, the hotel was very clean. Bunk beds were very comfortable and each bed had its own plug sockets with USB ports which was very welcome. Each bed also has its own TV. Towels are supplied in the room and were changed each day. Room itself is small, which is expected but I was pleasantly surprised as it wasn't as small as I expected after staying in similar style hotels in the U.K. We each had a full sized suitcase which were left open for the entire stay and we moved around comfortably.Above the door of the room was an indicator panel to show which of the shared bathrooms were free / occupied. The bathrooms were adequately sized and shower soap gel / shampoo is supplied. Would recommend taking small towel from room for the floor as there are no shower matts. The overhead showers were great, full range of temperature. The rooftop is definitely worth a visit, great views and nice furniture to relax with food or a drink. The bellhop can keep store luggage and also arrange flat rate shuttle or car service to the airport on departure which is very handy.

When I arrived to my room, my room was directly across from the elevators. The doors and walls are very thin. I heard the ping of the elevator all night long and didn't sleep. The next morning, I went to take a shower and the handle fall off the fixture. I asked for a room change for my second night. I walk into the second room, it was hot, smelled horrible and the air conditioning did not work. It was also right near the bathrooms. I ended up being woke up each time someone used the bathroom all night. The rooms themselves are very small and with a small sink similar to what you would find on Amtrak. The bathrooms are tiny and there were only 2 for the entire floor. The showers and toilet is in the same unit. If someone is in the shower and you have to go, you are out of luck.

The room was so much better than we thought it would be. Although quite small, which was to be expected, this was not an issue at all. Each bunk had it's own good-sized TV at the end of it and a compartment in the wall for charging phones etcThere was also a small desk and chair in the room, a safe, and a sink with a mirror and plenty of towels. There was also a place to hang up clothes.The fact that we had a shared bathroom was not an issue at all. There were 4 bathrooms on our floor and we never had to wait to use one. There was only ever 1 or 2 being used at any 1 time. The bathrooms themselves were very nice, they varied slightly in size but all had powerful showers with lovely hot water and were cleaned regularly. The thing that we were particularly impressed with was the fact that our room was cleaned every day, as well as our beds being made and towels replaced. This was not something we expected at all. The thing to really mention about this hotel is the amazing roof deck! It has the most amazing views of the surrounding skyscrapers and really makes you feel like you're in the heart of NY. It's great to just sit there and take in the views. The location of the hotel is great as well, it's on the upper east side, and is about a 15/20 minute walk to Times Square and 15 minute walk to Central Park. Other places of interest such as Greenwich Village are about an hours walk away, but this is not an issue if you feel like walking there because there's always things to take in and explore when walking around the city. The closest subway is about a 3 mins walk away (53rd Street, Lexington Avenue) so that's really handy for those times when you don't feel like walking. All in all we had an excellent stay, the hotel was very clean and comfortable and has everything you could possibly need. It's perfect as a place to come back to have a good sleep after a long day exploring the city.The other thing to mention is that the hotel is in a very safe area so it would not be a problem for solo travelers. The hotel also provides free fast wifi which is also very handy. We will definitely be staying at this hotel again and we highly recommend it, especially considering how affordable it is!Tip: If you are coming in to NYC via JFK airport and want a straight forward cheap way of getting to the hotel, then get the airtrain from the airport to Jamaica Station, and then get the E subway train to 53rd Street Lexington Avenue. It only costs about 7 bucks per person.","London, United Kingdom","Elsa W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",4,5.0

Booking in and out was easy. Often after booking out staff lose a little interest but when it came to sorting us a car to the airport they could not have been better.

Two staff members really stand out: Brian who is the concierge and Maria who helps with reservations. Kudos to them. While many hotels have rooftop bars etc, Pod 51 has a great rooftop that you can access to free! You can grab a glass of wine or beer from the downstairs' lobby and bring a picnic up and watch the sunset. They also serve the famous Essa-bagels (the deli is right around the corner but the Pod charges less and you don't have to wait in line for 45 minutes!). There is also an outdoor patio on the lobby level and a fussball table in the lobby as well as ipads mounted into the wall where you can pull up info and print out boarding passes etc. My favorite ""pocket park"" is across the street next to the synagogue. Great place to hang out and decompress and listen to the sounds of the waterfall. The rooms are compact but very smartly designed with underbed drawers, plenty of hangers in the two small closets with shelf, a safe, a long built-in table desk for working/eating. Compact bathroom with shower and toilet. Sink is in the room and the only thing I would change would be to put a towel hook to the left and right of the sink for hanging used handtowels. We had a room with two queen beds and our own bathroom. Other rooms have bunkbeds and shared bathrooms. Rooms are clean and air conditioner worked well. Although our the rooms with two queen beds are located across from the elevators, they were not bad noise-wise. Like most New Yorkers, it is easy and cheap to have your laundry picked up and delivered the same day. I would send out about 10-15 pounds of laundry and pay $10-14 USD. The clientele are mostly young professionals/ travelers but there were older couples, a few families, and clientele hailed from all over the globe. Free internet and decent speed. I would probably recommend this over Pod 39 because of the free rooftop and access to restaurants.",seattle,"travelmutter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>seattle</strong>",176,5.0

After reading reviews online, comparing it to a European hostel, the primary reason for booking it was the reasonable cost. Through a booking service, it was literally one of the most reasonable stays in Manhattan (and that is saying something!) After arrival, check-in, and an elevator ride to our floor, we approached the room, entered it, and I almost suffered a panic attack! It looked somewhat like a prison cell - the INCREDIBLY small size of our room was shocking! There was a bunkbed, with nary two-three feet of space to walk alongside. There is no bathroom in the room, just a very small cubby, with a working sink. There is a small closet cubby, with ample room for neatly stacking a suitcase or two, along with coats and shoes. There is a desk and chair at the foot of the bed. There are shared bathrooms on each quad of the floor. Above the door in your room, there are indicator lights, which let you know which bathrooms are vacant and which are currently in use. (These shared bathrooms were initially the source of my greatest concern, but I have to say that they were kept INCREDIBLY clean! And it was also nice that individual packets of necessary toiletries were provided, as needed. The shower units also had wonderful, adjustable spa shower heads and depending on which facility you used, some also had massage jets, adjustable for neck and back - nice touch!) Each bunk was equipped with its' own television, which was attached to an arm that could be extended out for viewing and then pushed back in to place the tele out of reach...quite clever. We had a lovely, old-fashioned barn-door shutter that opened for spectacular views of this extraordinary city. Considering we spent very little time in our room, it ended up working out fine for us, after adjusting to the very confined space. There was a wonderful concierge, who was happy to help with providing pamphlets, city maps, and gave great advice on where to go and the best and most affordable ways to get there. All in all, it was a good pick for us. They do have other room options available...we did not have a chance to view any of those rooms during our stay.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","SteelerNationBabe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</strong>",17,4.0

Now When I first got to that 230 I noticed the smell, the smell of a serious damp problem in that room, I didn't see any but it just smelled of damp and the smell stung my eyes but then things got worse when I couldn't touch the light switch; the light switch was extremely sticky! There was something like glue on the light switch or something all I knew was that I had to use a tissue to use the light switch and that tissue got stuck, which is disgusting. So I asked for a second room and I got given the room 812, a much, much better room I was so happy the only downside to it was the over powering smell of cheap air freshener.  My favourite feature of this whole hotel was the roof top. Every morning I would get breakfast from one of the cafes close by then take it up to the roof top and eat breakfast, the view was spectacular and it was great to it breakfast there. There was a garden but nobody really used it because there was literally nothing in there, but the cafe was good even though they only sold breakfast food and stopped selling hot food at 11:30am after that time it was only snacks that they sold.  The location was good, a good 10 minute walk to Times Square, 15 minute walk to Empire State Building and 20 minute walk to Central Park. But if you don't want to walk that far there is a lot of subway stations close by the hotel to take you around. I personally I chose to walk everywhere and it was a great walk to everything; even walked the hour and 30 minute walk to the 9/11 Memorial & Museum.  Another down side to the hotel was check out time. I got confirmation I would check out at 6pm, as I had chosen a late check out but when I went to the front desk and asked them about this they said ""Check out is at noon, if you want to check out at 6pm you'll have to pay for an extra nights stay"" which I found absolutely ridiculous considering I wasn't going to use that extra night if I had paid for it. Only good thing was being able to leave your luggage in storage while you go out for the day and come back for it later.  I highly, highly recommend the walking tours, especially the tour on Wednesday! The walking tours are free, you just speak to those at the concierge desk and they set you up then you meet at the scheduled time. I found there really wasn't much choice in the walking tours but the Wednesday one took everybody around Grand Central Station where they let us buy some New Yorker snacks like Black & White cakes, New Yorker Cheese cakes and took us around the Rockefeller center telling us little facts we wouldn't have known before. They were so informative and after the tour gave us precise directions back to the hotel. Overall I highly recommend this hotel and when I am next in New York this hotel is definitely a place I will be staying again!","Chesterfield, United Kingdom","Lucyj96</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chesterfield, United Kingdom</strong>",83,4.0

However once there I was more than happy, I never once had to wait to use the bathroom. It was always very clean and so was my room. The cleaners do a fantastic job in Pod 51. The air conditioning was a little on the noisy side but I still slept well. The cafe is well priced and I had breakfast there 4 or 5 times. Reasonable selection of food and drinks available. Coffee, bagel and granola with yogurt is about $11. I would highly recommend staying here as it's very handy for seeing the sights especially as there's the stop for the 4/5/6 a block away and only two blocks away on 53rd street is the E which takes you down to the World Trade via Penn Station or you can use it to get from JFK once you're off the AirTrain.

My first time I managed to find a good deal for an ensuite and the room was perfect for my needs. It was a decent size for New York (although still on the smaller side), and the room was very clean and comfortable. A/C was amazing, and unlike some other hotels, you can keep it on during the day so you can come back to a lovely cool room. Being a solo traveller, I had no issues with the ensuite bathroom although some couples may find it a bit awkward as the shower section was just transparent glass, with a frosted sliding door to close off the toilet area (my door kept sliding back).I checked back into the hotel a few days later and stayed in a room with communal bathroom facilities down the hall. Room was smaller but still adequate for what I needed, and the bathrooms were always clean.Wifi worked perfectly during my entire stay, and being able to leave your luggage after check out was very helpful for people like me with late night flights. Also the location of the hotel is perfect as it's walking distance to many tourist sites and there are two subway stations that are a 5 minute walk away. As a female solo traveller, I felt safe walking back late at night as all the streets were brightly lit. There is also a yummy bagel place nearby (Ess-a-bagel), a cheap diner that was great for breakfasts and also a bakery with the most amazing cupcakes and puddings. Tip: my first day I spent 20 minutes trying to find a grocery shop to buy bottled water and snacks but there is a large pharmacy called Duane Reade nearby that sells almost everything you'd need.Would definitely recommend this place, and I will be staying here again during my next trip.

You really can't get any better for the price in this neighborhood - while it the Waldorf Astoria it ain't, it fulfills everything it needs to be for the no nonsense traveler who wants to spend more time exploring all that NYC has to offer versus holing themselves up in a hotel room.The desk staff were very nice and helpful, and having luggage check was superb as I literally got in, dropped my bag, and ran to get to the Yankees game. The elevators a wee bit tiny, especially when it comes to fitting multiple people and luggage, but it's Manhattan, so what do you expect...I was always able to find a spot to get in and get to my floor. The 14th floor rooftop terrace was awesome. You're situated right in between so many beautiful buildings, so the view may seem blocked to some, but I really enjoyed the feeling. They have it laid out really nicely with reclined chairs and a table, so I would definitely check it out as a place to unwind after a long day out and about. The rooms are small, like barely a dorm room small, but that's what they're supposed to be. Mine looked a little well worn with some scuffs on the wall, but it was very clean, and it mini-sink was stocked and also very clean. Honestly, the pillow provided was 110x better than any of the pillows I've had at any of my recent, large name hotel stays. Loved the flat screen TV! Air conditioning works GREAT, so bring a jacket if you get cold at night. The shared bathroom thing felt a little weird to me when I originally booked, but it's totally doable. There's a light up display above your door that let you know which bathrooms are occupied, and they are decently clean. The only downside is that they don't furnish paper towels, which honestly is kind of stupid. I get that we're supposed to bring our hand towels with us, but that seems fairly unsanitary, and doesn't make sense when you've been out all day and want to make a beeline to the bathroom without having to stop at your room first (especially when you already need to wash your hands!). Everyone ends up trying to use the bathroom tissue to dry their hands, which shreds and then gets on the floor. I think you'd save more money in the long run, as well as keep things cleaner, if you shelled out for some paper towels! The only other downside is that they don't furnish any kind of water like a lot of chain hotels do now. It would be nice to put those water cooler-esque water jugs on the floors so that people could refill their water bottles after long days walking around the city.Overall, this is not a place I would bring a large family to or stay for a fancy, romantic vacation, as it is pretty much the bare bones of traveling. However, for similar solo trips or trips with a few friends, I would absolutely book again because the location is great, and it was very fairly priced for NYC. You're literally a less than 15 minute walk from Grand Central, and are in a cool neighborhood with a lot to offer right on the surrounding blocks. You can easily get to any of the main tourist spots via a less than 30 minute subway ride, or there are a bunch of Ubers/cabs always nearby. I felt very safe staying here as a solo female traveler, and am glad I took the plunge and tried it out!Thanks for a great time, Pod 51!","Atlanta, Georgia","Ashley L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",28,4.0

I went to their website to see what that entailed and it said TWO full sized beds. When my girlfriends and I arrived to our room and it was the size of a bathroom and had ONE twin sized bed! When I complained to the manger and showed him receipts of my payment AND the picture that THEIR website showed for the room. He still proceeded to tell me that because I made the order through a third party website (working advantage..perks from my job) that I was not guaranteed that kind of room. This does not make sense for many reasons: 1. There was no disclaimer for this on any of their sites or even my email confirmation. 2. If your website shows two beds for that type of room am I wrong to assume that is what I will be getting? So after talking to him some more he finally gave us a room with two beds (although not full) AND a balcony which was nice. Another issue I had with my stay at this hotel was the fact that I had a random man come knocking on my door at 5am claiming that I had his belongings, as I told this man that he had the wrong room and would be calling the police soon, he proceeded to go downstairs to the front desk and call security. Security came back to our room with this very crazed and angry man insisting that we should all come out of the room. As three young females in NY fro the first time, none of us felt comfortable or safe showing our faces to this clearly violent and abrasive man accusing us of having his belongings. We obviously refused and sought safety in our room. It baffled me that the security guard would want us to show our faces to this man who., for all we know, did not even stay in this hotel! As security his first priority should have been the safety of the CURRENT hotel occupants. For the rest of the night we stayed up waiting for police to come...they never did. The next morning, we went to the front desk to complain. I was shocked that no one from management had come to check on us to make sure we were alright. With our luck, we saw the same gentleman in reception STILL claiming we had his belongings. After speaking to the manger for the second time in 24 hours, he found the REAL culprits. The crazed man tried to apologize but we were all to shocked and disgusted by the situation to even care for one. Another thing, you would think that after an ordeal like this and paying nearly $500 for two nights (granted it was labor day weekend), that we would be compensated in some way by the manger....NOPE! All we received was a 'sorry'. No discount off, No free breakfast, NOTHING! Another thing to add, this hotel does not have an ice machine or a water fountain to make sure to bring bottles with you. We were so displeased with our experience with this hotel that we did not even try to go to the rooftop (a big attraction for the hotel). We just wanted to leave ASAP! All in all, make sure you are very safe and call and confirm everything with this establishment before you actually go.

There were bunk rooms and shared bathrooms on our floor, and we had to pay a high price for a private double room with ensuite. Maybe this is New York prices, but it was expensive for what seemed like a pimped-up youth hostel. Having said that, they tried hard to make the communal feel of a hostel work well, with a nice bar with a small selection of essential food items, a nice outdoor courtyard and absolutely excellent rooftop area, with amazing views across the city and comfy loungers scattered around. They had no problem with your bringing in your own food and setting up a nice little feast on the rooftop. Lovely. The room was described as small, so yep, it surely was very small. Barely larger than the bed, but comfy and lots of (openable!) windows, so it didn't really feel that cramped. The bathroom reminded me of those moulded fibreglass cubicles you have on overnight trains - squeeze in and don't breathe out or you'll get jammed in there. We're both skinny and it was a struggle to sit on the loo without crashing your knees. They had installed a light in the shower cubicle so it didn't feel so tiny and dark, luckily, otherwise you'd never find the soap. But the location was great, and we can highly recommend getting your breakfast across the road in the most beautiful 'wild' garden in NYC - and the city's best kept secret. The simple cafe food and good coffee can be enjoyed in front of a spectacular waterfall in serene garden - no cost, no hassle, no stress and a cool haven from the heat and crowds just a few metres outside. I can't remember what this miraculous garden was called but if you get a chance its on 51st street almost directly in front of the Pod 51 hotel.","Warsaw, Poland","melangedevise</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Warsaw, Poland</strong>",41,4.0

In a city where even Holiday Inns are expensive, Pod 51 is like a hidden gem. It's right in Manhattan, it's affordable, and it's nice. A close walk (or uber ride) to wherever you need to go in Manhattan. The rooms, although small, are very clean and well-kept. We only stayed for one night so we didn't need a big room since we'd be out of the hotel most of the time anyway. The beds (especially the pillows) were also surprisingly very comfortable. When we arrived on a hot, slightly humid day, the room's AC was on and it was so nice and cool inside. And since I forgot a blanket, we set the AC on a bit of a lower temperature and on a low-cool mode and it was the perfect temperature. I was initially worried about the shared bathrooms, but after reading reviews, I was relieved because everyone described how clean they were. I'm very particular about bathrooms and it's the one thing that needs to be clean when I'm staying somewhere besides my house. I found them to be nice. I don't doubt that they were clean, it's just that I'm a bit of a germaphobe. On my floor, bathrooms 1 and 2 were very small, while 3 and 4 were bigger (3 was the biggest). So make sure that you check all four to see which ones you'd like to use! I was glad I decided to go to bathroom 3 even though 2 was vacant. There was never a line for them and I only ever saw one bathroom occupied at once. I do wish there were paper towels inside for your hands though.There's also a nice little waterfall-rainforest-themed area across the street where you can sit and relax, along with a little food kiosk close by.

They have a system of lights where you can see in your room which bathrooms are vacant. Fortunately I had one next door to my room. The room itself has a tiny wash basin and it seemed like the room was about 6 by 12 feet or so. The a/c is a tiny and very loud window unit and the bed was pretty hard.

Although the other hotel is probably better located (as a tourist) and costs more i preferred pod 51. Pod 51 is located in east midtown and appears to be in the business district. There is a subway within a few minutes walk which makes it easy to access the rest of the city and its attractions. Some of the sights like rockefeller centre, bryant park, ny library and even central park ate within walking distance, but otherwise the train is convenient.There is many restaurants/cafes near the hotel. The hotel has a good rooftop deck and i got takeaway and ate up there which was quite nice.The room is smallish, but given the hotel name is pod i think guests expectations should be clear. The bed was comfortable, there was aircon, a safe, tv, sink, free wifi. There is shared bathrooms (appears to be 2 bathrooms per floor) and only a few times were they both occupied (if so just go to another floor). There is also a light in your room which indicates whether the bathrooms are occupied or not (good idea).There was no real issues. The lifts at times took time to be free and the aircon is a bit noisy but for the price (given the cost of hotels in ny) i was happy and would stay again for the right price.","Melbourne, Australia","AdamJK_82</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",182,4.0

I really liked the design of the double room we stayed in and, surprisingly, it was plenty of space for two people! However, one thing really let the whole experience down. On the day we were leaving, we saw two cockroaches running around the room! It was really disgusting to know that they had been roaming around the place - we didn't even keep any food in the room at any point. I would normally consider it as an unlucky one off situation but I have seen some other reviews mention cockroaches so it really is about if you are willing to take the risk or not.

The rooms are cute and fun as long as you know going into it that you're getting a tiny pod of a room. But it works and it's fine. The big problem for us was the air conditioner unit. Since it was very hot when we were here, we didn't have the option of not using it. But whenever it would come on every 20 minutes or so, it would emit a very loud buzz two or three times in a row before fully engaging. So it was literally like an alarm clock going off every 20 minutes, right next to my head, jolting me awake, all night long. In addition to that, you could hear every other nearby room door open and slam shut all night long as well. So between the A/C and the doors, we hardly slept at all. Thankfully the staff was cool and only charged us for the one night and refunded us the rest. Perhaps other rooms are quiter or have better A/C's. Or maybe in cooler months its a non issue.

Our keys didn't work on the room we were given, so they easily switched us to another one which was fine. The walls are extremely thin, we heard lots of ""adult play"" at all hours of the day and night. The sign on the back of each room door encourages it, ironically! The rooms are small but we expected it, and were very happy with the space we had and the room organization (drawers, hangers, shelves etc). We had a bathroom in our room. Note on the bathroom in your room, there is a sliding frosted door and it will either cover the shower or the toilet, but not both. So be comfortable with the person your staying with!! We used the hallway bathrooms for #2 because that worked better for us. If you use your toilet you will want to slide the bathroom door shut, but then as soon as you step into the shower you want to open the bathroom door so it slides to cover the shower...its interesting but didn't bother us. The room was serviced every day. The cafe down in the lobby is great for breakfast! but is open all day for snacks and food. We really utilized the rooftop deck, brought up our own food and drinks and relaxed. There are 2 day beds, and about 10 relaxing chairs, as well as another 8-10 around a large table. The deck was the most memorable perk to us! The location is great, only a 3-5 minute walk to the subway, and about a 10-15 minute walk to Times Square. I highly recommend the pubs on 2nd Ave (right around the corner from the hotel, less than 2 minutes walk) The food is wayy more reasonably priced than anywhere else in NYC.

We have stayed in a similar (small room) hotel in London and Pod 51 is much bigger. We had chosen the bunk bed option (as it was cheaper). In the room there was a small desk and chair, a rack to hang your clothes up, a little sink with an area to put toiletries, a hook by the sink which was perfect for your towel, towels and a hairdryer, coat hooks then the bunk beds which both had plug sockets with a little shelf and their own telly. The beds were very comfortable and all bedding was clean. The air con was ok but a little loud. We had 2 bathrooms on our floor and lights in the room indicated if they were available or not. I was a bit apprehensive about shared bathrooms. However, they were always clean and had good water pressure. I would sooner have clean, modern bathrooms that are shared than older, dirtier ones that you can come across in cheaper hotels. The staff were friendly and helpfull.

I've not had the best of luck with hotels in NYC, but I was really pleasantly surprised. It's cool and comfortable. The range of folks staying there was very diverse. From families on vacation to business people, with a broad range of languages being spoken. The staff is very nice and welcoming. The rooms are exceptionally clean. it was really wonderful.The rooms are very small, which is fine. I stayed in a Queen Pod with it's own bathroom. There is no dresser, but there are drawers under the bed for storing your stuff and an open closet. There is not ironing board or coffee pot, but there is a hairdryer. The safe is pretty useless unless you have tall, narrow objects. The bathroom is tiny, but if that is a problem for you, the shared bathrooms are much larger, but they are shared (natch). It's a lot like staying on a cruise ship in the extreme functionality of the room. I had a corner room, so there were windows on both sides. Really nice to have the sunlight and the breeze. I kept the windows open at night, since the air conditioner was a little loud.I stayed there for a week and plan on staying there again. The hotel is quiet and on a quiet part of 51st street. There are a number of nice, neighborhood restaurants close by and the cafe in the hotel serves a simple, tasty breakfast and snacks all day long. There is a garden on the first floor for lounging and a rooftop garden. The hotel has no parking, but they will give you a discount at the Icon parking garage about a block away. They validate your ticket at the hotel desk, so make sure you take it in with you.

Our room was cleaned daily and the bed made. We had a great air con system in our room which was welcomed after miles of walking. We went up to the roof top patio i guess you would call it twice, there's no signs for it but if you go up to the 14 floor and turn right out of the lift then walk to the end of the hall there is a door on the left which take you up to the roof. It's great for sunbathing and has great views! We had clean towels everyday and a hairdryer in the room (a reasonably good one too). We were located on the 4th floor facing the front (street) we had little to no noise as the neighbourhood is quiet but you do hear the occasional horn from a car but that is everywhere in NYC. The rooms aren't huge but they are practical but I’m not fussed on size as I’m only there to sleep as i spend the days/evenings out exploring the city. Location was great, everything is about a 15 minute walk away (times square, grand central, central park etc) there is also a subway station 1 block away. There are great little places to eat located all around the hotel so you're spoilt for choice. You can also order food from the hotel which we did on occasion which was good and reasonably priced for NYC. another thing to mention is the rooms come with a safe and you get free wifi during your stay. there is also a good space in the room to hang clothes with hangers provided.We were there for 7 nights and i would definitely re book to stay here for my next visit to NYC.","Bristol, United Kingdom","Natalie S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bristol, United Kingdom</strong>",6,5.0

Located on east 51st St. near 3rd Avenue, it is within a block or two of two subway stations and within walking distance of St. Patrick's Cathedral, MOMA, Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Station, the New York Public Library, and the Morgan Library. A French bistro is just next door, a Thai restaurant two doors up, and a 24-hour Duane Reade drug store just a block or so away. Of course, this is an ""economy"" hotel, so I expected the minimum of service and was startled when, just after my airport shuttle dropped me off, a bellman suddenly came rushing out the hotel's front door, greeted me, and assisted me with my luggage.This hotel is priced for the budget-minded traveler, but nothing about it is ""cheap"" or ""low rent."" The clean, spacious lobby features a nice mural about New York life, and just off the lobby is a nice lounge where guests gather for breakfast, chat, or checking e-mail or the internet on one of three terminals built into the wall (I was able to use one of them to check into my return flight and print my boarding pass to the printer behind the front desk). Just outside the lobby is a garden balcony for enjoying one's coffee in the cool morning air. And the roof, 14 floors up, features a very spacious deck with plenty of chairs and a nice Midtown NY view. I was in New York to meet friends and had breakfast elsewhere, but prices on the a la carte breakfast menu (posted in the elevators) seemed reasonable, and alcoholic beverages were also available for purchase. WiFi is free and works well.The staff are all professional, courteous, and accommodating. Although no one announced this, I'm pretty sure they have a plainclothes security officer in the lobby each shift, from the way the men I saw looked and carried themselves, and of course, this adds to the feeling of security, even though the hotel seems to be in a nice neighborhood anyway. Complimentary copies of USA Today are available at the front desk, and a soda machine is nearby. Walking tours are available for guests two or three days a week, and guests can even seen up to be in the audience on the Larry Wilmore show.Room prices are a great bargain for Manhattan. The room was one of the smallest I've ever been in, but everything was so efficiently and elegantly arranged that I never felt cramped or closed in. I suppose there must be rooms large enough for couples, but I stayed in a single. The room included a sink and mirror, a recessed ""closet"" space that even included a built-in safe, a bath towel, hand towel (but strangely, no washrag), a blow dryer, plastic drinking tumblers, two bars of soap, small vials of body lotion and conditioner, a wall-mounted flat screen TV, a single chair, a spacious counter-type desk, an in-room phone, a clock radio, a wall-mounted reading lamp, a bedside table, several conveniently placed electrical outlets for recharging your phone, and an extra pillow on a shelf in the closet. ""Clean, comfortable, cozy, and convenient"" were the words that came to mind. Rooms are available with in-room toilets and showers for a higher rate, but I stayed in one with a shared bath for the sake of a lower price. I haven't shared a bath in years, and it was my only misgiving, because I thought that two rooms had a bath between them and that I might end up locked out because the tenant of the other room forgot and left the door to my side locked from within. In fact, there was no need for anxiety. Each floor has two adjacent rooms marked ""W.C.,"" with a clear indicator on the door as to whether it is vacant or occupied. Your room key also opens the bathroom. Each bathroom has a toilet, sink, and shower stall with plenty of hot water and wall-mounted dispensers of soap and shampoo. Over a 3-night-stay involving 3 morning showers and one in late afternoon, as I prepared for an evening out, as well as one nocturnal visit each night to use the toilet, I never saw either bathroom occupied at all or had to wait for one to open. One or two guests were a little inconsiderate and left their wet towel mats lying next to the shower instead of taking them back to their rooms, but overall, the bathrooms were clean and neat.The bed was only just big enough for one person, of course, but quite comfortable, as were the pillows. The air-conditioning kept the room cool and pleasant. Interestingly, though I would hear music and conversation coming from other rooms as I passed them on the way to mine, once inside my own room, I heard nothing at all from outside, though part of this may have been because I had a corner room. The window shutters kept out the outside light sufficiently to let me sleep.I have only four complaints:1. No washrag with your bath linens. I haven't bathed or showered without a washrag in 35 years.2. Although I got maid service, on my second day there, no hand towel was left with clean bath linens, and I had to stop a hotel staff member in the hall and ask for one.3. On one of my mornings there, I called the front desk around 6:15 (in other words, when it was not busy), and it rang ten times, and no one answered.4. The elevators are sometimes so slow that you wonder if the call buttons aren't working.Overall, though, I highly recommend this place. The location can't be beat, and if you are traveling alone and watching your budget but still want a place that is clean, well-run, and with some reasonable (and even unexpected) amenities, the Pod 51 is worth a serious look.","Fort Worth, Texas","Michael H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Worth, Texas</strong>",113,5.0

There was an indicator over the door that lit up to show which bathrooms were occupied. Having the bathrooms out in the hall was not an issue - not once did I encounter another person while on the way to the bathroom, and not once during our visit were more than 2 bathrooms occupied at once. The showers were fantastic and spacious, with rain showers and temperature adjustment by degrees. The location is also excellent; a block and a half from the subway. The rooftop patio was lovely as well. We would definitely stay here again.","Toronto, Canada","Jess2136</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",2,5.0

This is a nice, simple, easy on the wallet hotel. Clean. Polite staff. So, I forgot my cell phone in VA, so I wasn't able to take any pictures to go with the review. The room I stayed in was the most affordable type, bunk bed suite, I had the room to myself. You don't share the rooms with anyone. The room is small, equivalent to a dormitory single in college. Small desk, sink inside the room, plenty of towels, pillows, tissue, hand soap, lotion inside the room, hangers, and a luggage rack. The bathrooms are shared, outside of the actual room. They have these little lights inside of the room that notifies you which restroom is occupied. The bathrooms are clean. Equivalent to a gym - a clean gym. So, you take your towel and shower stuff, use your key card to enter the bathroom and lock up. The shower is inside, and the water falls down like an overhead waterfall. Kinda cool actually. They have shampoo and shower gel inside, but I always bring my own. I recommend shower shoes or flip flops and a bathrobe - or you will have to dry and get dressed *inside* the bathroom which is sort of narrow. It gets humid and muggy so getting dressed inside was annoying. Next time, I will bring a long bathrobe. I considered sneaking out in my towel and running to my room, but I figured that may not be following polite etiquette. So, I sucked it up and got dressed in the friggin sweltering, humid bathroom. The lobby area has a nice little patio off to the side, tables and benches to sit on. They have a mini-snack bar that sells coffee, snacks, bagels, breakfast food, beer, wine, etc. There is a rooftop deck that you can hang out on which closes up at 10 pm - or slightly afterwards. The rooftop is cool, has nice lounging chairs you can just sit back in and take in the night time view of the city. I forget the hours of operation. I took my meal I had purchased nearby and ate it up there. I noticed they offer free walking tours and the opportunity to sit in on the Comedy Central studio audience on Wednesday night. Bummed I was checking out so I couldn't attend.I saw families, people traveling alone, business people, couples, and people from all over, different languages floating in the air.Decor is modern, colorful, and I would add...sleek and upbeat. I made reservations for the bunk bed room and said to myself, if its too small, I would bump it up a notch. It was fine.Not noisy at all - but I was here on a weeknight, not the weekend. Beds are comfortable. If you're into paying $300 + per night at a fancy schmancy hotel - just to sleep...then go right ahead. I paid $158 total, including tax and slept like a baby! I will definitely return. Maybe I will try the other pod hotel the next time. This place is awesome.",,NinzzR,4,4.0

Check in was quick and hassle free and all staff were helpful and friendly. Our room was on the 9th floor and it was spotless. We knew it would be small and this didn't worry us as it was just a base for our busy week. There was only a couple of niggles for me, one was that it did not have a view of the city as this would have been nice and the other was the lack of any privacy with regards to the loo & shower. (Frosted glass on the shower would be better). That said, it was a very nice room with an extremely comfortable bed, a desk with phone and i-pod charger/clock, hairdryer, air conditioner and a lovely rain style shower. The maid service was fabulous and we left a little tip each day (she didn't take it on the first day as we just left it on the desk so on the other days we left it with a note saying 'thank you'. Proves the honesty of staff.There is a wonderful roof terrace with modern loungers and big beds to relax on. A little shade would have been appreciated as it was really hot and sunny and I did get burnt, but it was a great spot to relax, surrounded by skyscrapers & listening to the sounds of the city. There is also a small garden/courtyard area at the back of the hotel which also has a lovely atmosphere. If you fancy an early morning bagel, there is a fantastic bagel shop just round the corner called Ess-a-Bagel, which I cannot rate highly enough. Try the PB&J, it's amazing. Pod 51 is perfectly situated close enough to be able to walk to Times Square, Central Park, Empire State Building, Rockefellar Center and all the shopping in the city, but it's also far enough away from all the noise to feel less hectic and quite relaxed.

First, the size of the bunk pod (@ Pod 51, twin bunks) that I had was dorm room size. My guess is around 100 square feet. But the designers put a lot of thought into what you need in a hotel room: Desk, chair, hooks, individual TVs, individual lights, safe, etc. No refrigerator. A small window. The mattress is just OK. Enough space to open your suitcase. You are back in your dorm room, only NYC is right outside. So the room size and its design are OK. Second, the shared bathrooms for the least expensive rooms are just OK. They are clean, but the shower head is difficult if you are 6' 2'' or taller, the toilet is difficult if you are obese, and another clothing hook would be useful. The doors lock for privacy.Bathroom indicator lights for the shared bathrooms (on your floor) are on your room's wall. (I think the Pod 39 location only has small private bathrooms). Towels are in your room. Your room has a small metal wash basin with running water. So the shared bathrooms are acceptable.Some overall comments: the communal spaces are good and well designed; the area around Pod 51 is pretty good. Times Square is about a 15 minute walk. So the location is good. The hallways are dark. I did not get to go to the hotel rooftop because a fire broke out next door (May 16, 2016) and the hotel was evacuated by NYFD for about 2 hours, and still smelled like smoke for the rest of the night. The concierge can call a car for you to go to LGA airport for $40.Finally, the price is right.

The staff, as per their sister hotel were extremely helpful. Especially the concierge team right next to the door - don't think we ever walked in or out without a hello from them. The hotel had a fantastic bar upstairs with a great view and friendly atmosphere, with most of us all there for similar reasons. Location wise, you are in good walking distance, if you like walking, from rockafeller centre, empire state, 5th avenue, public library and even Central Park if you enjoy a good walk. On my previous visit I had a shared bathroom, which I would probably do again on my next trip based on that the en suites have frosted glass doors, which leave very little to the imagination and made worse in our room that the bed faced the bathroom. On this occasion I was travelling with a friend but even as a couple I think I would find this uncomfortable.

You can have a little breakfast and drinks and snacks, however, best bagel shop ""Ess-a-bagel"" is around the corner, plus many good restaurants with Thai Food, Burger, Irish pub, Indian cuisine, Original New York Kitchen like Clam Showder, etc., etc. A true highlight is the small but quiet garden and the fantastic roof top terrasse on 14th floor, I loved it! I had a room with own shower. Yes the rooms are small but everything has a very good functionality ( e.g. drawer under the bed to store extra parts). With a small desk and wireless LAN, I was able to work without problems. I'm quite a big guy but didn't have any problems using toilet or shower and the mattress and pillows were really fine, I slept very well!

The location was just ideal, it was maybe a 20 minute walk across to Times Square and it's only afew minutes walk to the 6 and E Metro lines which pretty much took me everywhere I needed to go!The surrounding Neighbourhood of Turtle Bay was cool with good pubs and restaurants and there are two 24/7 Duane Reads/Walgreens really nearby which is really convenient. There are also a few laundry's within walking distance if you're travelling for an extended period as I was. I had a single room with shared bathroom and it was actually a more spacious room than I had expected based on the pictures and the previous reviews I had read. For me on my own there was ample room! There was a sink and hairdryer in the room as well as storage space with hangers. The window ledges behind the shutters proved very useful for keeping a bottle of wine cold too as there was no fridge in the room. The shared bathroom was always perfectly clean and there were 4 on each floor so I never found myself waiting for access. They also have this cool light panel in your room which showed you whether any of the bathrooms were occupied, so you didn't walk down their in your PJ's only to stand and wait in the corridor! My only slight criticism was that I felt the reception and concierge staff probably could have been a little more friendly and welcoming but to be honest, I had such little interaction with them that this didn't impact my stay in any way.In comparison to prices of hotels in Manhattan this was such great value for money and I would definitely stay here again on return to New York.","London, United Kingdom","N3325ZJlaurenh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",8,4.0

Walking down the hall was an easy accommodation to make for the great price.The room itself was clean and neat, offering all of the amenities of a regular hotel room, just with a smaller square footage. No complaints there. And despite the fact that everyone was walking down the hall to use the bathroom, I don't remember footsteps outside my room keeping me awake at night.Lastly, the area is solid, close to a few different subway lines and very walkable.

You are steps to the subway and/or buses and have awesome restaurants surrounding you. Walk to Times Square if you must, it's easy to do. It's really incredible that they can offer such inexpensive accommodations in such a fabulous neighborhood. But of course there's a price to pay if you want this neighborhood for this price, and it's minimalist living-- bunk beds for some, shared bathrooms for many, and paper-thin doors for everybody. BRING FROM HOME: earplugs for sleeping and flip flops or shower slippers if you have a shared bathroom because EW, you never know what's on the bathroom floor when you're sharing it with forty people.BRING FROM ROOM: a hand towel from your room if you share a bathroom you will be using your jeans to wipe off otherwise.Now, the longer form:Pod51 is a mostly-successful attempt at cooperative, short-term living. The vibe is slick and modern with clean lines and uncluttered spaces. It is clean and well-managed. The common area has large, shared work tables, free WiFi, communal iPads and a small commissary/bar. Free walking tours are available three days a week--each targeting different ""hip"" areas of NYC. It's nicely thought-out and the standards are higher than you would find even your typical name brand hotel (sorry, Hilton). All for an incredibly low price. The upsides are that the location is OUTSTANDING and the building is fresh and contemporary. Rooms are tiny but serviceable. The rooms that do not have bathrooms come with a small sink area which makes sharing a bathroom with forty of your closest neighbors survivable. Outside noise was at a minimum for NYC, which was a welcome surprise. Front desk staff are friendly and helpful and check-in was a breeze. We did not avail ourselves of concierge services, but the desk is adjacent to the front desk and was staffed at most reasonable hours to help you with any information or resources you might need. After you check out, the ""doorman"" will cheerfully store your luggage as you continue on your New York Adventure to maximize your stay.We loved 90% of Pod 51. But we also spent most of our night listening to the 24/7 bumpin' radio in the room next door. For some reason, the doors of Pod 51 allow an incredible amount of noise to penetrate any given room. I could speculate why but it's not important: what's important is that you prepare yourself with earplugs in advance.Besides that, you'll have a blast staying at the Pod 51. Which my kids read the sign as Poo 51 (thanks to an ambiguous ""futuristic"" font) and that's how it will forever be known by our little family, on our no doubt regular returns.","Evanston, Illinois","ZaMartin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Evanston, Illinois</strong>",35,4.0

How stupid of me to believe that anything in this price range ($150) would be nice in NYC. We requested a Q bed w/ ensuite bathroom. Well, the first room we were put in had the bathroom with a door that did not shut and was about 2 feet from the bed. As in, one could literally sit on the toilet and almost touch the bed. In addition the tv didn't work properly so we requested a new room the next day. Management was very happy to oblige because there just happened to be a nicer room available. We moved our belongings to the new room immediately without having to wait and went out for the day. The room was nice but it the design is quite comical. At least the bathroom door shut.When one is laying in the bed, there is a huge window that looks right into the shower (no privacy at all. IF the door happens to be open then there is a good sized window looking into the bathroom.. one person on the commode and one peaking in.. what fun. It is ok for partners sharing a room but a bit awkward for 2 singles etc.The second night we realized how very thin the walls must be as our 'neighbors' returned at approx 2am and laughed loudly almost the whole night... and hey, we were in NYC so of course they got take out at 3am. The walls must be paper thin. You can hear everything!! Well, you get what you pay for. IF these little issues are no big deal to you then yes it is a great little hotel, nice staff, a restaurant/bar on the lobby floor and a great location.",york pa,"travelinmama1731</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>york pa</strong>",109,4.0

We paid in total 1147 pound for direct flights and 4 nights on Expedia. We found this to be the cheapest rate at the time and this hotel is a cut above the rest you'll find for that price. The location is fantasic, about a 10-15 minute walk to Times Square and Applebee's (of which we had pancakes and coffee every morning) it's about 8 mins walk from the Rockefeller centre. We found taking the subway line 4&5 (I believe it was) for 2 dollars to get to lower Manhattan was a no brainer. Bit scary on the subway but worth it lol otherwise if only going 5-6 blocks take a taxi for 6-8 dollars plus a tip. The hotel was clean, modern and basic. YES the room is small as people keep complaining, but who flyes 3000 miles purely for the hotel room? All that matters is it's clean comfortable and a good base to get your head down, with polite friendly staff. If you want space for this price go stay in a flea bitten shack that hasn't been cleaned In a week or get real. Only buy from the hotel bar at happy hour unless your rich. There's always someone sat by the hotel reception who will give you advice and directions for a small tip, we recommend keeping the map they give you, it was a life saver. The restaurant was under refurb when we visited so can't comment however this was good as it forced us to get out and explore for food. We had shared bathrooms which is no trouble at all and I'd do it again, you have about 3-4 per floor and they are clean and have a good jet on them, you rarely bump into anyone and they are so close it's really not worth paying more to have your own. Plus bare in mind we are quite conservative in nature and were concerned at first but it's really no big deal.Couple of recommendations for you if interested:For a good authentic candle lit Italian with fantasic service and food try Osteria Lounge on 209 East 42nd street.For a more upmarket restaurant serving amazing food try Hillstone on 153 East 53rd street, this is the best restaurant Ive been to, the atmosphere and style is like you see in a movie. I had the campfire ribs. Best ribs I have ever eaten without doubt. Same prices as every other restaurant which was surprising. Make sure you wear a shirt and smart shoes or you'll feel out of place.For a proper greasy American diner check out Genes diner, 26E 60th street. We asked a bellboy where he recommends. The service was great, food was good and a great experience, close to Central park.Be sure to get some honey roasted almonds from one of the food stands, watch out for the guys on them, they can be a bit hostile and money hungry. Plus if anyone tries to give you a free CD saying they are a performer, just ignore them. Being a friendly person and from England I said okay then when i didn't want to give him the exact tip he asked for he just turned from nice to nasty. I get the tip culture but saying it's free but you have to give me 5 dollars for it means Im buying it for 5 dollars. Plus when I said I have no small notes he pulled out a wad of cash and said its okay I have change. Get lost pal. So yeah just ignore them.Biggest con is tipping everyone, it ends up costing you a lot more than you bargained for. But this is their culture and I am a big believer in embracing people's culture if you're a visitor. However what's annoying is when people think they can choose their tip, 95% of the service was fantasic and youll take pleasure in giving them a nice tip. However when the service is lousy and they still expect a tip and write what they want on the receipt, that I don't agree with. But this is rare and happened about twice amongst dozens of restaurant visits.Sorry to go on. But I'd 100% recommend this hotel and I'd stay here again and id also like to say thank you to all the friendly New Yorkers who actually made it a much more pleasant, friendly and awkward free place to be compared to England!

The story made international news and was quite distressing for all those involved. I instantly notified the hotel from the plane saying we'd be a day late. Upon arrival and a call to booking.com, the hotel flat out refused to have any compassion and shift our stay by one day, charging us for a night we weren't there. As a consequence we had to pay another $102 for another nights stay (as Virgin were kind enough to move our return trip ahead by one day to compensate) since then the hotel have still refused to show any understanding or reimburse us. The maids were also incredibly rude and do their cleaning from as early as 6.30am, causing much disruption through the thin walls and even knocking on the door at this time to see if we were in. The location is fantastic and there's a little table alongside the reception where there are two people who are very helpful and friendly in helping you to find your bearings. The bathroom door in our room didn't even close and had a window??? So it took very little effort for my partner and I to watch each other do our business, which is pleasant in any hotel. Normal amenities of a room like a fridge or kettle aren't included so expect to eat out all the time unless you want their $4 croissant.

We had a room with 2 queen beds and private bathroom and found we had more than enough space. The rooms were extremely clean and very modern. The beds are very comfortable and the room temperature was well maintained. All the amenities of a 5 star hotel for much less money. The location is perfect- very close to the subway but only a short walk to 5th avenue and Times Square. The let down for us however was the staff. We found the reception and concierge staff to be rude and uninterested in helping guests. The bell boys however were very nice and helpful. We unfortunately both became extremely sick while staying here and called a doctor. The doctor came and arranged for some medication to be brought to us at the hotel. On arrival the pharmacist asked the front desk to call the room to let us know he was here and when she called she said ""I guess you have ordered medication""... It might just be a petty observation in my part but I find that comment a little inappropriate. We also went to the reception desk at 5:30am and asked if there was anywhere in the hotel we could get bottled water (due to our illness) and she just responded with ""no"" and went back to her work. I guess we just felt the staff to be extremely unenthusiastic compared to the other hotels we stayed at this holiday and we felt like we were bothering them if we asked them anything. For the younger crowd that this hotel attracts, I would think the staff would be a bit more vibrant. Unfortunately we just became too sick and had to cut our trip short. The lady on check out was surprisingly lovely and didn't charge us for the 3 nights we did not stay which we were more than happy to pay. Mixed review for a mixed stay.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, check in was smooth and quick, and we soon found ourselves comfortable in our room ""full pod with private bathroom."" The room is small, but what do you expect when the name of the hotel is ""pod"" but for a couple this is not an issue. The bed was comfortable and wide enough and the shower was always hot water and refreshing. We stored our clothes and belongings in the draws under the bed and hanging space so we did not need to live out of our cases despite the lack of space. If you're not spending much time in the hotel, it is the perfect place to stay for an amazing price if you are exploring New York. We had made service everyday which we were very appreciative of. The subway station is a 3 minute walk away, and we purchased a 7 day pass for $31 which we used all the time. At first the subway is confusing but within 4 trips on it we had worked it out and found it absolutely great the rest of the week. I would recommend anyone staying in New York to take the subway everywhere, it's just great, quick and actually quite fun! We purchased a ""New York city pass"" online for our week in New York which was an absolute godsend, It gains you entry to all the top attractions plus discounts at resteraunts and loads more. We worked our we saved $603 by buying the New York pass as entry fees are very pricey everywhere, I can't stress enough how badly everyone should buy the New York City pass! It is a blessing. If you want the worlds best hot chocolate, visit the ""deli 2 cafe"" in Times Square, we went everyday for the amazing hot chocolate and we are having withdrawal symptoms already! Overall, we had the best week in New York City and would happily visit the pod 51 hotel again and again if we ever return. Will be recommending to anyone we know who will be visiting the city.
