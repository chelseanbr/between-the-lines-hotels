The previous night we were at the Hilton Odaiba. We had dinner with friends at the Ninja Restaurant next door to the Akasaka Excel so decided to stay here. It is your typical Japanese hotel. We arrived an hour before check-in but couldn't go to our room (normal in Japan). We came back and had to queue for some time as there was only one staff member on the desk. This was not your usual Japanese service.The room was small but fine. The beds were very comfortable and there were some nice shower amenities. The window was only single glaze but there was very little traffic outside at night so noise wasn't a problem. We got some breakfast at the 7-11 in the basement of the hotel.This hotel was fine for a night.,"Brisbane, Australia","mjref</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",43,3.0

The rooms have sufficient space for the standard tourist's needs, and the shower in particular was fantastic (not a universal thing for hotels).

It was close to five Metro lines (Akasaka-mitsuke & Nagatacho stations) which made getting around the city via train very easy. The hotel also had a 7-11 in its lobby, which was very convenient for getting water and snacks (more on this later).The check-in process was very smooth when I arrived at around 7pm. My room was on the larger side for Japanese rooms, with a good sized desk, clean, and located on the quiet side of the building facing some green space surrounding a few government buildings. The room included all the amenities you could need, including a small fridge, electric kettle, single cup coffee maker, hair dryer, and pants press. The bathroom also contained many single-use convenience items like toothbrushes/toothpaste, cotton swabs, hair comb, razor, etc. The glass-enclosed shower was large and contained a multi-function shower (overhead shower, body spray, or hand-held wand) with excellent water pressure. The wifi was a little finicky, where I'd have to force my iPad to ""forget"" the network so I could log in again to get it to work, but that was usually limited to once a day, and it was speedy the rest of the time.I would like to give extra praise to the hotel staff. When Typhoon Hagibis hit, everyone in the hotel was very helpful in answering questions. They communicated when they weren't able to have room service or have housekeeping come around (though you could always call the front desk for extra towels or other items). And the 7-11 in the lobby was perfect for grabbing food and water in case anything happened. In the end, the hotel never lost power, and the food I grabbed at 7-11 saved me as most everything nearby shut down by 1pm on Saturday and didn't open for 24 hours. I would definitely stay at this hotel again, though hopefully next time without a typhoon!","Cambridge, Massachusetts","kalanz02</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, Massachusetts</strong>",14,4.0

This was our second port of call in Japan having traveled up from Osaka. We had 2 rooms booked but decided a third would be needed. We asked for a price for the third room and were given it. We decided to look on other booking sites before deciding. We found a room in the hotel on Booking.com for a much lower price than we had just been offered by the hotel. We asked if they would match the Booking.com offer and they said NO.....No movement on price at all. So, we found ourselves in the position of my wife checking in to our 2 previously booked rooms will I sat down at reception and booked another room on my phone. We weren't looking for it to be cheaper than Booking.com and realistically if the hotel had have made a reasonable offer we would have taken the room directly from them but nope...The guy seemed to be senior and the other staff seemed a bit taken aback by his decision but there you go.

The lobby of the hotel is on the third floor and my room was located almost at the end of the hallway on the ninth floor which is a long hike from the elevator.Like most of the hotel rooms I experienced in Japan, it was a little on the small side in comparison to U.S. hotels. The bathroom, although small, had a deep soaking tub - which worked for me because I'm not tall. They also had one of the Toto high-tech toilets which was a blast - pun intended. The amenities package was overwhelming - toothbrush with mini-toothpaste, razor, comb, brush, hair ties, make-up removers, Q tips and probably other things which I have forgotten.There is a Tully's Coffee on street level a few doors down from the hotel entrance - kind of provided a home-away-from-home feeling. I bought a suitcase for a good price at the store across the street so I could avoid overweight charges on the airline. The entertainment district across the street was fun - lots of restaurants, karaoke places and a cat cafe. Can't beat a Cat Cafe if you're suffering pet withdrawal. There is a large temple - the Sanno Hie Jinja - a few blocks away on the same side of the street as the hotel. The shrine was originally built in the 14th century, but the present shrine was constructed in 1958 after the prior shrine was burnt down in a 1945 air raid.My main complaint was that I couldn't figure out the air conditioning controls and had to open the window to get some air circulation - along with lots of traffic noise.

We had a room with two twin beds facing the busy street. Noise wasnt much of an issue for us but the occasional siren would go by. The room is small compared to US standards but not for Japan. There is a nice sized closet that we kept our bags in to keep them out of the way. In comparison, we had a room in Kobe with no closet, so that when we opened our bags we couldn't walk at all.Room was clean. Beds were nice. They have a couple pillows on the bed. One felt like it was stuffed with plastic beads which we thought was a little different. But very usable. The window set up was nice. They had the black out drapes, then a light filter slider which was nice for privacy but allowed light thru. If you opened up the slider then the window also opened up which was nice to get fresh air in. They provided everything you could need in the room - toothbrush/toothpaste, razors, q-tips, hair bands, liquid shampoo and body wash. The room has a safe, refrigerator, and two bottles of water were provided everyday. They also had the ""handy"" phone which is very nice. Our phones ran hot and cold, but the handy phone could be taken out with you and meant that you always had Google maps and could download apps - like at the Imperial Palace to allow a self guided tour. Also, free international calling but found it only worked to phone land lines not other cell phones.Staff assisted us with reservations at a cafe. Conveniently, the bus to the international airports stops right there several times a day, and is only a few dollars more than navigating the subways. 7-11 is right down stairs.The subway station is right across the street which is handy. If you you go past the subway station, west, you are into a ""quieter"" neighborhood. The staff provided us with a list of their recommended ramen restaurants. We did not get their breakfast package because of the price, but it is offered. Downstairs is a coffee shop but we also found the McDonalds :-) about 5 minutes away.In summary, if you want a very accommodating, service oriented with no surprises hotel, this would fit the bill. Staff spoke English. The hotel feels like you are in a chain hotel that could be anywhere in the world, which may be exactly what you are looking for.

Yes, the rooms are small but not unusually so for a Tokyo hotel. It is slightly more expensive than the other hotels in the area, but not by much. And the hospitality service has the usual high Japanese standards. But the main reason why this hotel is such a good choice is that it is the best hotel near Akasakamitsuke station, a well-known crossing point for the two oldest subway lines, the Marunouchi and the Ginza lines. These two lines allow you to get to all the major Tokyo districts of interest by just using one line (no changes) -- Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ginza, Tokyo, Ueno, Asakusa, and Ikebukuro. Add to that, there are great restaurants covering all tastes and budgets in the main Akasaka district just across the street. Plus the hotel is major enough to be one of the Limousine Bus stops, handy for those with a bit too much luggage to lug around the subway.

And it's all because of the location. The hotel is located in Akasaka which is really the ideal place to stay when in Tokyo if you want to be close enough to take a very short train ride (on a direct line) to the key areas, and walking distance to an array of great restaurants. The hotel is literally across the road from Akasaka Mitsuke station and it's incredibly convenient.The hotel itself is quite lovely (on the inside, maybe a little 'practically designed' on the outside), you don't really see the staff as the foyer is not on the ground floor. The room we had on the 10th floor was relatively small (especially compared to Hotel New Otani which is arguably much fancier and cost the same), and as a result there was limited storage space and the bathroom was truly TINY. The bathroom door got in your way when you're at the sink to give you an idea.You did get a Nespresso machine though and a Handy free-wifi phone which is great. And the bed was excellent, just the right firmness. I got a great nights sleep here, it was actually hard getting up.I'm increasing the rating for the hotel purely for the location, otherwise the small room and tiny bathroom would have brought it down (for the price).","Melbourne, Australia","Joasia-AU</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",25,5.0

The metro station and the heart of Asakasa is just a stone throw away, divided by a main road/foot bridge. Having said that, this is also a negative as you do receive a considerable amount of traffic noise during peak hours. Luckily the traffic does die down at night (unless police/ ambulance decides to whiz pass the hotel) Corridor – The corridor (approx. 100m in length) runs the full length of the hotel with a main lifts foyer in the middle. If your room is close to the lifts foyer, it can get noisy; but if your room is at the end of the corridor, it’s a long walk to the lift… choose your room location wisely. Room – Reasonably sized by the Japanese standard, not big and just enough room to place your luggage. Considering the size of the room, it’s probably adequate for business traveller but I can’t say the same for our 4yo. There’s not much character to the room and it feels a bit dated considering how grand the foyer is. Don’t expect too much as it’s just a standard room – 4 walls, small TV (no English channel) and a large window facing the main road. For the very least, the room is clean. Check in/Check out – Super fast and effortless. Having said that, do expect a long queue at the time of check out. Service – In typical Japanese fashion, everyone (but one) was super nice and really helpful, most speak English which is handy. We did endure an incident with the man-in-charge (the manager, maybe?) at the porter area whereby we wanted to use the scale to weight our luggage at the waiting area (no traffic and less than 5 metres from the porter area). Not only was the man super rude and inflexible, he would not let us use the scale unless it is 1 metre within the porter area – this proved to be extremely inconvenient given that the porter area was within a high traffic area. In the end, we had to move our luggage one piece by one piece (between the waiting area and the porter area) and battle the traffic to weight our luggage. Despite the bitter experience, some of the (female) staff did offer to help (move our luggage) which was nice of them. 7-Eleven – Located on the ground floor, this proved very handy for snack.","Sydney, Australia","DonIsGood</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",105,3.0

It’s a great home base for seeing this side of Tokyo, and it eases you into Tokyo life at a slower pace than Shinjuku. The metro and buses are just steps away. The room sizes are large by Japanese standards, and very comfortable. We especially like the superior double, it has a bit more space and well worth the little extra cost. There are restaurants in the lobby, but you’d be better off going out to the terrace restaurants or across the street, where there are tons of places to eat.The bed is very comfortable and the style of the rooms is light and airy with modern zen overtones.

It's not really a luxury hotel. It's not cheap but compared to the rate at say the Intercontinental this was nearly half.Lets start with the room. Yes it small. Very small but it's very comfortable and has everything you need. Its clean and tidy. Not modern but everything worked fine. I actually was very comfortable. I'm a big guy and was fine in this room. the room had a small refrigerator and a Nespresso coffee machine with 4 capsules each day. Nice touch. My room was on the main road side and there was very little noise, except the occasional siren. You could open the window which I liked and the room was completely black with the curtains closed.My only issue was that I ended up in a smoking room. My mistake at booking (I'm not used to hotels allowing smoking anymore). Unfortunately they didn't have a non-smoking double room and I have to say I suffered with the smell. If you are a non-smoker, make sure you check when making the booking that you are getting what you want.Getting to the hotel from Narita was fine. I like the fact that this hotel is on one of the Limousine Bus stops, or you can get there very easily by train. I had to depart early from Haneda and it was a very simple 30 minute taxi ride for about US$60. The location is excellent. It's directly across the road from a massive electronic store (Bic Camera) which keeps any gadget nut like me busy for a few hours. Apart from that there is a huge (I men huge) selection of restaurants and bars in the same building and directly across the street. Simply walk across the street and there are three narrow lane ways each about 300-400metres in length stuffed full of restaurants and bars, many open 24 hours. All of them cater for English speaking visitors. Remember that Tokyo is a 3D city so when looking for a nice place to eat look up, as many of the are on the 3rd or 4th floor.There is a 7-Eleven on the ground floor for everything you need. There are numerous cafe's and restaurants in the place.The service was professional and helpful but not overly so. They provided the information I needed when I asked and gave me enough information to get me where I was going.As for breakfast I would suggest dump the hotel breakfast and go and get something from one of the Cafe's in the building (Tully's Coffee is right there) or across the street. There is a Starbucks about 3-4 mins walk away/The hotel is a very comfortable mid range hotel.

Can I eat something small for lunmch, like a sandwich. No sir, we are full for that. Does my room rate include breakfast? No sir, you must buy a ticket in advance (non refundable). Would you have some tomato sauce (ketchup)? No sir, we do not have that in cluded in a $25 breakfast. The room is dark and stuffy and VERY small.

You can see them in the photos.Secondly, the amenity were below average. Before this I stayed at Super Hotel LOHAS Tokyo Station Yaesu Chuo-guchi and it was much cheaper with much better room (smaller but cleaner) and amenity. The bed is ok, but in the middle of the night the speaker on the desk started to make static noise and we had to unplug it. It was not a pleasant experience after a long day.Lastly, we booked this hotel with the expectation that it has coin laundry machines. I booked directly on their website and under the list of facilities there is a link for ""More Details"". After clicking into it, you can see ""coin laundry"" clearly listed under the Facilities section. Screen caps attached. Or you can visit their website directly.However, when we arrived, we were told there was no coin laundry. When I showed the staff the website, he was confused as well, and said it must be a mistake because they have never had coin laundry, but only laundry service (which was very expensive). I asked if we can get compensated because of their false advertisement, and he said he would get back to me. Half an hour later he called our room and said we were the one mistaken, that the list of Facilities were just ""possible facilities"", and only the icon in the previous page (before I click the ""More Details"" link) were the facilities actually offered.Ok, I suppose that is an explanation, that I have misinterpret the website. But why not make the website more clear? Why name the link ""More Detail"" as if suggesting that there were more facilities? Why not make it clear which facilities were actually offered, and which ones were not? And why would their own staff be confused when he first looked at the website???When I presented these question to them, all they did were apologizing. No actual action were taken even though the staff admitted that the website was confusing. I'm not just complaining about the service because of this incident. I stayed at 3 other hotels during my trip, and every one of them offer better customer service than this one. They were more accommodating, caring, and valued your business. They gave you warm greetings when you walked in and out of the hotel. Akasaka Excel Hotel Tokyu offered none of these. They just did the very basic and wanted you to get our of their way. For a big hotel chain I expect them to have better maintained rooms, better customer service, and offer some kind of compensation for falsely, or at least, confusingly, listed facilities they do not actually offer. However, there is not even a comment/complaint section on their website. This alone tells you how much they care about their customers.I seriously recommend you staying away from this hotel. If you are looking for a location close to train stations, go with Super Hotel LOHAS Tokyo Station Yaesu Chuo-guchi. It's a 3 min walk from Tokyo Station, and it's much cheaper and better than this place.","Los Angeles, California","Sirian W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",1,2.0

I can't speak highly enough about the house keeping team. They are excellent. We asked for an iron and ironing board to be sent to our room and it was delivered in less than five minutes. Also I needed some items sent to the laundry. They were collected first thing on Monday morning and were waiting in our room on our return after a long day of sightseeing. The three shirts had been washed and ironed perfectly. Each sealed in plastic. When opened it was like putting on a brand new shirt. Adjoined very conveniently to the hotel is a 7 Eleven store with all the usual offerings. There are also various restaurants and a Tully's coffee shop within a very short walk from the hotel entrance.As mentioned earlier this hotel is in a great location at Akasaka-mitsuke on the Tokyo metro system. There are two entrances for this station at either end of the hotel. Akasaka-mitsuke metro station has five different metro lines that you can connect to via different station entrances or station walk ways.Most of the metro stations in Tokyo are huge in size. At first they can appear intimidating and confusing. No need to worry if you are patient and take your time to read and follow the signs which are in Japanese and English. By the ticket machines there is usually located a staffed information booth were you can get a metro map and ticket advice.The staff on the metro are extremely polite and helpful and all of the metro and station staff we spoke to on our trip helped us to navigate our way around this amazing city.I would highly recommend this hotel.

I immediately went to the front desk and asked about moving to a larger room. This was granted for a nominal additional fee. The breakfast buffet is so so for a westerner ( I am sure lovely for locals). I don't have really any complaints just nothing great that I can place my finger on. If available, I would definitely stay up the street at the New Otani (The Main) as my experience there was much nicer.","Denver, Colorado","DNver</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",36,3.0

The location was excellent, with the railway station opposite the hotel and the quaint older area of Tokyo only a stone's throw away. The area has many international restaurants including an excellent selection of Italian ones, all very reasonably priced. In fact, food in the restaurants was not nearly as expensive as we had been led to believe. Even fish and chips is available for those who are less adventurous! However, the hotel breakfast which was included in the price of package was disappointing. The Japanese breakfast offered a reasonable selection but the American/Western style breakfast was very limited. One could have scrambled or boiled eggs, bacon, small sausages and a small selection of bread rolls, most of which were on the sweet side. Moreover, the food was lukewarm or cold, making it less than appetising. The coffee was quite good. There can be a long queue so it is a good idea to go to breakfast early. In addition, the bedrooms were not very comfortable. The first room that was offered to us, a double one, was so small that there was nowhere to place our two suitcases and hanging space was almost non-existent. We asked the hotel reception to transfer us to a room with more space and we were were given a room with twin beds, overlooking the main street. The staff were very obliging in allowing us to change rooms. Reasonable English was spoken at reception. Another point is that the mattresses are extremely firm, which one can get used to. However, the two pillows on my bed were difficult to sleep on! One pillow had husks, rather like small marbles inside and the other was filled with some sort of sandlike substance - I believe it was buckwheat. Both were extremely uncomfortable to sleep on. I asked for a softer pillow on our second day and the staff obliged,mercifully! There is a small smoking room in the foyer area but it does not have chairs.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","juliejt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",69,3.0

Across the street (where also the subway station is) you have a very big BIC electronics store.

There's also a fridge, a water cooker with different temperature settings so you can prepare tea, a Nespresso machine with 4 capsules, TV, free Wifi, and sufficient storage space for luggage (see also pictures).Be aware that street noise is present in the rooms facing the street.A recommended hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to go back there - although not cheap, it fits within the hotel prices in Tokyo.","Hasselt, Belgium","MarcMich</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hasselt, Belgium</strong>",301,4.0

Just beware the quilt cover as it appears to be made of some man-made non-porous fibre that caused me a sweaty night or two until I realised, and then slept with it off!On the positive side the shower is one of the best I have ever had in a hotel and was fantastic to wake up to.

It is across the street for the Akasaka-Mitsuke station on the marunouchi line and ginza line.It is 3 stops from Omotesando station, 4 stops from ginza station, 4 stops from Shinjuku and 4 stops from Tokyo station.On top of the station is a 9sty shop called Bic Camera. It is a must see destination, other than cameras, they have a drug store in B1 as you exit the station, a liquor shop on the 5th floor and a stationery shop on the 4th floor. Prices are cheaper than most retailers.The akasaka area on the other side of the station is a few streets choked full of restaurants and drinking holes. There is even a decent supermarket.So the hotel is well positioned for both business and shopping. The 7-11 within the same complex is also well stocked if you will not walk 5 minutes to Akasaka for the usual lawson and family mart.The breakfast buffet offers a good selection of western and japanese style spread with very fresh ingredients. Very dependable for 2500Yen if it is not included in the room price.The rooms are small, typical in Tokyo but generally larger than those around Shinjuke stations and the APA chains.The hotel was closed for renovation and reopened a few years ago. The bathroom with a decent size tub (by that i mean you need to be not more than 165cm tall) is still spotless. But the carpet inside the room was already showing signs of wear and tear and stains. This is my only gripe.Otherwise all good.Oh, and the cherry on top of the icing for me would be the limousine bus service to both Narita and Haneda Airports that departs from the hotel.

The location is its strong point being across the road to a train station that links easily to all the major tourist spots in Tokyo and is only 4 stops from Tokyo station. This is helpful if you are using the train system to get to the airport and access to the bullet train system for further access to most of Japan. The other good point is that across the road and in the streets behind the station, there is a fantastic array of restaurants to tempt the taste buds. The place is a little tired for a big city hotel but the staff were pleasant enough. There were some significant bad points. Despite requesting a non smoking room, it took all day to get the smell of the smoke coming from the bathroom, presumably from the last occupant who didn't know/care of its non smoking status. The really annoying point was the air conditioning. It defaults to 22 degrees Celsius and then when you try and turn it down it won't allow less that 20. There was some weird round thing which I assume was a portable air conditioner but it's fan hardly put any air out. If you have heat loving daughters, no real issue but with 4 hot males the situation was pretty ridiculous as none of us sleep in a room heated to 20. The window, for safety reasons, only marginally opens which is understandable but didn't help our cause.

The room was quite small by American standards but met my needs with only on exception: they have a system in place where you put your door's key card into a wall holder, which then switches on all the lights in the room (as well as the heat). However, when you remove the card it shuts off everything in the room except appliances connected via wall sockets. There seems to be no switch to turn off the ceiling light, so if you're reading in bed (using a convenient wall sconce with its own switch) and then decide it's time to go to sleep you have to get out of bed, remove the card, and then fumble back in the dark, as now no lights work (or heat!) Definitely a very strange system that had me wondering if I was doing something wrong.It should also be noted that while the room was quiet, the door itself is paper thin. Whenever someone was in the hall, or if a door opened, you could hear absolutely everything being said.

The bathroom was well appointed, including the latest in in toilet technology, complete with heated seat and other functions.I only ate one dinner in the hotel and had a good meal from the a la carte menu - the usual buffet was unavailable that night, due to a corporate event.

Actually this place has improved quite a lot from when I last stayed here maybe 7 or 8 years ago. At least some, maybe all, of the rooms have been updated and now justify the price. They used to be a bit pricey probably because it's a government/finance/entertainment area. The rooms are now more stylish, clean (which they always were) and modern.Check-in was very fast and efficient, but courteous and delivered with a smile). They were a little busy, but so pleasant they don't make you feel rushed (even though the whole process took less than a minute).Our double room was what they call ""和のテイスト"" (Japanese taste) room with a shoiji (wood/paper) screen window and other Japanese accents. However, slide the shutter in front of it before sleeping, to keep the room dark. Rooms at the back (sometimes) face onto trees which is nice. The room was an OK size by Japanese standards, but of course it'll be small if you're used to US/some European hotels. One nice thing about our room was that there was a small table by both bedsides (we always like to have mobile phone and water bottle there). There's also free WLAN. There's TV, not sure of the channel selection, we didn't check.We both slept OK, you get two pillows neither of which are especially soft so the harder one was relegated to the floor quickly. The beds are very comfortable in my view. It's a Simmons bed so should be good.The bathroom had a shower but no bath (I think this depends on room type) with a toilet on a raised section. Beware of that step if you get up in the night and forgot! The bathroom has a window between it and the bedroom, so set the blind to not allow light into the bedroom... Overall the room looks good, with brown/white striped carpet and dark wood/veneer. Facilities include trouser press, tea-making set, toothbrushes and some toiletries, of course air-con, and WLAN and power points (but only on one bedside table - hmmm). PC rental is available for 1500 yen per night. Note that there are several types of room so your room may vary a lot from the above. Price may also vary widely, and to get the best price you probably have to get a special rate from a Japanese web site. It's probably not allowed to name them here, but Japanese hotels have many very short-lived specials which don't get translated for the big international web sites. If you compare this hotel against other big chain hotels in the area (Tokyu is a big company) and they are in the lower price range, you got a good deal.The area is well served for transport, some of the orange-and-white Airport Limousine buses stop right in front (didn't see, just checked the bus website though). Akasaka-Mitsuke metro station (Marunouchi line, Ginza line) is just over the road. From the airport, if you don't know Tokyo, maybe take the above-mentioned bus. From Tokyo station, metro, or taxi is probably under 2000 yen if the luggage is heavy.Depending on price, this place comes back onto my list of should-check hotels due to (a) refurbished rooms and (b) sometimes reasonable pricing.","Chiba Prefecture, Japan","mjb1001</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chiba Prefecture, Japan</strong>",109,4.0

I enjoy travelling to rural areas like Kamakura and Kawagoe so I take the JR and subway a lot. The location of the hotel is located opposite of Akasaka station, which is right in the middle of Tokyo station and Shinjuku. I can easily get to Tokyo station to change to JR trains for rural areas, whilst I can just as easily get to Shinjuku for shopping and food. There is also a Bic Camera, a pharmacy (a must go in Japan), a street filled with restaurants (my personal favourite is a cafe named Choco Croc) and convenient stores all around. So if you just want a quick bite near the hotel, that is also available. there is also an airport limousine bus stpp right in front of the hotel. All in all, perfect location.Aa for the room, it is perfect for Westerners. It is quite big considering it is in Tokyo. There is also a nespresso machine and a bose sound system which is a nice touch. The air purifier/humidifier is also a god sent. The bed and pillow is very comfortable although the duvet is a bit heavy for spring weather. There is free wifi which is very nice. The bathroom is well equiped, with the ubiquitous heated toilet seat and a rainbath shower with massaging spray heads in the wall. All in all, excellent functionality.There is no free breakfast coupons as in most Japanes hotels but because I usually leave my room late in the morning anyways I prefer it like this so the coupons wont go to waste. The staff are friendly and spoke decent English. Excellent hotel. Will definitely recommend to others and will go back next time if I travel to Tokyo again.","Toronto, Canada","jensen0811</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",94,5.0

Though we had the option to take rail, there is the ""Airport Limousine"" shuttle bus that stops here among about 6 other hotels. After a long day of flying, an easy and direct option is appreciated.Staff was very friendly and certainly spoke enough English for us to get all settled with no trouble. Bags were delivered directly to the room.The rooms are decent sized for Japanese rooms - modern and clean. The bathroom was large and the shower had a fantastic 'rain-shower' style shower head, best of all the hotels we stayed at. Windows did not open, but each room had a cooling air purifier which kept the room cool provided you could figure out the buttons. I hear that windows in rooms on the street side do open.The hotel is very conveniently located right next door to the Tokyo Metro Akasaka-Mitsuke station, through which runs the Ginza and Marunouchi lines. From this central location, it was easy travel in all directions to other major stops, often with no transfers.Attached to the hotel is a 7-Eleven, which is a tourist's best friend in Japan. 7-Eleven ATMs are among the few that will accept North American bank cards, and the consistent selection of foods and amenities is very useful after a long day of traveling around. Several other restaurants are also located directly in Tokyu Plaza with a variety of styles.Across the street, the BIC Camera store offers a wide range of electronics and general goods (even a pharmacy), and the narrow streets around and behind the building offer a great range of smaller eateries, cafes, and sweet shops.As a first-time visitor to Japan, this hotel is highly recommended. #1 out of the 8 different accommodations we stayed at while in Japan.

There are however big sized dispensers of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel available for use. What you pay is what you get. Having been in Tokyo before, I was prepared for the size of the double-bedded room, and as Japanese standards are always high in terms of cleanliness, I really had no fault to pick. The bed is firm, which I like. There is free wifi in the room. We were out most of the time and only needed a decent place to sleep. Its proximity to the train station makes travelling easy, and the food streets lined with eating places and restaurants just across provided a large variety of choices. There is the BIC Camera shop, it sells many things! Other than that, I do not see much in terms of shopping. There are the usual big grocery type of stores that sell everything! But it's in a nice quiet area. We spent Sunday morning having breakfast at St Marc and enjoying the street view from the cafe. The only gripe I would have was that the aircon did not seem to work and it felt stuffy in the room, my husband assured me it was like that but there was hardly any cold air emitting - difficult to breathe. (The next hotel that I went to did have cold air.)

The purpose of my trip was obviously work, and my role as a software developer will give you an idea of my personality type (perfectionist, tidy, punctual, orderly...etc).The staff were fantastic - typical of Japanese hospitality service.The room is good for the price (I got a corporate rate of JPY16000/night). Free WIFI in the room, and connection by LAN cable in the room a bonus - great for SKYPE and watching online TV/movies through laptop connected to TV (I supplied my own HDMI cable). The room has tea/coffee machines but I never used them. The bathroom (with shower over bath) is typically small especially for someone 185cm tall. More expensive rooms have a walk in shower (would have been nice!!). I had no problem with the air-con during winter, but did not experience a summer there. Nights can get noisy with sounds from neighboring rooms and/or sirens on the main road outside - but not that frequent. Good wardrobe space. I always ordered more hangers for all my business shirts. Didn't use the hotel laundry service as I preferred to save money and use the laundromat 5 min walk away, and then iron my clothes myself (using good equipment from hotel)When it comes to food I'm very much a foodie - expect high standard at reasonable prices. IMO the hotel does not offer this. I ate dinner at the main restaurant many times only because I was using loyalty points, and even then I struggled to find good value. I had the full buffet breakfast once just to experience it, and at JPY2500 IMO it's not good value for the limited range of food on offer. I only enjoyed the scrambled eggs and toast (but I'm really fussy). The bacon is not what I'm used to in Australia. Not sure what it was so did not touch it. The range of fresh fruit was limited to 2, but not surprising given the cost of fresh fruit in Japan. For breakfast I was happy with my Weetbix I brought over from Australia, eaten in my room with my own bowl and spoon. But if you're into food you need not worry - within 5 min walk across the road you have everything you could want at reasonable prices - japanese, ramens, sushi, kebabs, subway, pizza, pasta, turkish, steak, indonesian, chinese, pubs, coffee, even a McDonalds and Hungry Jacks...etc,etc. Just brilliant. It really is food heaven. Exceptional lunches for JPY1000, and dinners for JPY2000. Much more expensive places also if you are after something special. Downstairs in the basement is a great cheap Italian place which was also great value. Don't try the Hooters - burgers I would only feed to my dog. I tried one and the bun was still cold (from fridge) in the middle. You go to Hooters for the novelty of the girls dancing around.The location is great because of the access to the subway across the road, and also the food choices. It is also about 25 minute walk from the nightlife district of Tokyo (Roppongi)l. I did this many times on Fri/Sat nights after the last train (which is around midnight). It is very safe to walk the streets in the early hours of the morning.For those interested in fitness the hotel does not have any facilities because they refer you to a gym in the building next door. I payed around JPY5500 for 2 weeks. Other rates are available. It is not a big gym, but has the basics and does the job.Overall great place.

The room wasn't huge, but it definitely accommodated the three of us comfortably. The beds were cosy and the bathroom was big, with a lovely hot, well pressured shower. The hotel is located about 2 minute walk from the Asakasa-mitsuke metro line which has you in Ginza, Shinjuku or Toko stations in a couple of minutes. There is also a Tokyo Hooters nearby :-)...or for he more discerning tourist, the hotel is located across the road from a little restaurant district with plenty of different cuisine's to choose from. We got a pretty good deal through Booking.com - room rate was about $AU200/ngt for a triple room so, given the location and cleanliness of the hotel, I thought this was VERY reasonable for Tokyo. Front reception staff all spoke very good English, and were also happy to entertain my average-at-best Japanese. Friendly and polite like all Japanese people!There is also a 7-11 located in the entrance to the hotel which is great for avoiding those minibar fees.Would definately recommend this hotel to family and friends!!",Aussie in London,"onthego83</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aussie in London</strong>",21,5.0

The bathroom on the other hand is really on the small side, even by Japanese stantards. My room was quite clean (spotless bathroom) and the overal hotel environment seems to be that way.Reception is a bit understaffed so be prepared to queue a bit for check-in and check-out if you do that at a busy time.Breakfast is really sub-standards both in terms of choice and quality especially with the hefty price tag unless you get it within a room package. So I strongly recommend you skip the breakfast there and get it outside in one of the coffee shops around.All in all I find value for money to be below standards.

For those who hunger for a midnight snack, there's a 7-11 at the basement of the hotel itself. How's that for convenience. The hotel room is rather tiny. I would recommend you give the Double Room a miss if you want space to move about amidst your barricading suitcases. Maybe opt for a Twin Room instead. And don't bother sliding open the window hoping for a view. The 4th floor Double Room window looks out to a backlane! And I reckon the walls and doors could be better soundproofed. Quite often you can hear conversations in the corridor outside. But there are nice touches aplenty really. There is free Wi-Fi connection, complimentary Nespresso pods for those who need an instant pick-me-up in the morning. And then there's this spiffy sci-fi shower adjustable head that directs jets of water on your head and all over your body. Brilliant.

Hotels in Tokyo frequently (usually?) have small rooms, but this one was ridiculous. I have been in bigger closets -- even in Amsterdam. One literally had to sidle crab-like simply to move around the bed. It was a shame the room was so tiny, because otherwise the hotel had everything going for it. Location (both for transport and for restaurants) was excellent. Limo buses from both Tokyo airports stop literally outside the front door. The internet connection was good. The room was well-appointed. But I would have happily given up the expresso machine, the Bose stereo speakers and the trouser press for a couple of feet of ""desk"" space. (I use the term advisedly: the ""desk"" was a ledge under the (sealed) window that started out the depth of my laptop and tapered down to just four inches.) There was neither a closet in which to hang clothes nor a chest of drawers in which to put clothes. (True, there was a rail on the wall that had four hangers. Let's see: one for an overcoat, one for a suit jacket, one for a shirt, one for trousers. (And, no, getting more hangers was not an option. The rail would only hold four hangers.) That may work for a one-night stand/business trip, but is wildly inadequate for someone like me who came to Tokyo to work for a week. Don't get me wrong, I am happy living out of a suitcase. The problem is that there is no place to put a suitcase. True, there is one of those folding suitcase stands, but that didn't get around the lack of floorspace upon which to open it. I assume the more costly suites have more space, but for the life of me I couldn't figure out who the room I had was designed for. Presumably businessmen use it. Certainly it wouldn't work for couples or a family.","Oxford, United Kingdom","sleepysteve</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oxford, United Kingdom</strong>",10,4.0

It was across the street from a Metro station and had a lively area nearby filled with plenty of restaurants. We did not spend much time in the room, but for sleeping the beds were very comfortable. We did not spend much time in the neighborhood, as we were more into sightseeing and I think this neighborhood is more about great restaurants. The room got a little hot at times, we kept the window cracked in December most days, but I found that every place I went in Japan ran a little warm so I think they just like heat. I found the hotel to be extremely accommodating, I needed an American style iron, and one was delivered. My husband needed a converter for his laptop, they had ones at the front desk that you could borrow. I wanted to mail postcards. They mail them for you at the hotel, and you just pay them for the postage! Small conveniences like this go a long way for someone like me. We did the breakfast buffet 3 out of 6 mornings at the restaurant- it had a really nice spread of both Japanese and Western style food. My only complaint would be that they served the exact same things at the buffet every morning, (but everything was delicious). The Airport Limousine (which is actually a bus) includes this hotel on their stops, which proved very convenient for getting to and from Narita AIrport.

Even then, I always left satisfied with a good collection of international bakery products, variety of cut fruits and vegetables.My Pain area, and this is the one that sweeps off ALL the good things mentioned above, is when I had to make the payment. They do not accept any MASTERCARD Credit cards (3 of mine they didnt accept) , although on day 1 they had swiped my card for checking (and due to some reason, some money was also debited from my account, which they refused to believe!).

I've checked out online hotel reservations, seem to be abt SGD200 per night which i think is reasonable. - Located near shopping area but i didn't do much shopping there because they look expensive- Convenience store just downstairs, good to grab a bite if you want!Bad:- Very expensive local calls ~290YEN for less than 10mins of local call. I stayed in Shinjuku Washington Hotel later and found out it was so much more cheaper 40Yen/3 min",Singapore,"Yvonne B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",18,5.0

Our hotel room was much nicer than I expected – it has been recently redecorated and doesn’t have the IKEA feel seen in the older pictures on this site. It was also a decent size—not huge, but you could actually walk around the bed. The double bed comes with two memory foam pillows and two buckwheat pillows. The bathroom is compact but you can still move around in it, and it has a borrowed view thanks to the corner windows in the interior wall - just be sure the shades are down when you take a shower! I recommend you ask for a room on the street side of the building, or, if they give you one facing out the back, a higher room. They tried to move us to a ""better"" room across the hall because it was marginally bigger. However, it was slightly below ground level, facing a dirt patch and a cement wall, with windows that didn't open. The last part was the deal breaker for me because this is one of those hotels where the thermostat in your room doesn't work unless they've turned on AC for the whole building... which they hadn't... and it was so stuffy in there I could barely breathe. Fortunately, we were able to switch to a smaller room facing the street with windows that opened.Other cool features of this hotel: It has a 7-Eleven on the first floor, which means an ATM that accepts US ATM cards and a cheap meal are always close by; it is adjacent to two shopping complexes with restaurants and stores and even a post office; and there is a street running behind the subway station that is jam-packed with restaurants and clubs.It's also one of only 15 Disney Good Neighbor hotels in Tokyo, which means it offers free motorcoach service directly to the parks - no small thing when the alternative is a 30- to 45-minute subway journey that includes a long slog with your luggage through parts of Tokyo Station that don't have elevators.Also, unlike many of the other Good Neighbor hotels, it is centrally located right in Tokyo, not out in the suburbs—good if your Disney trip is at either end of your vacation and you aren't planning to commute out there daily, although it can be done. The hotel is directly across the street from the Akasaka-Mitsuke Metro Station, which connects you to the Ginza and Marunouchi lines. If you don't use the shuttle, it's four stops to Tokyo Station and then a 10-minute walk down a loooooooong hall with stairs to the Keiyo line for Maihama Station and Tokyo Disney.",Los Angeles,"MrsJ0hns0n</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles</strong>",9,4.0

So compared to other Tokyo hotels, i felt it was good value for money. Recently renovated. Nespresso machine provided free. 7-11 store on entrance level. Metro station across the road to get you nearly anywhere. Great food across the road. Limousine bus takes you straight from airport to front door. recommended. free internet.","Townsville, Australia","LindaQld</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Townsville, Australia</strong>",12,4.0
