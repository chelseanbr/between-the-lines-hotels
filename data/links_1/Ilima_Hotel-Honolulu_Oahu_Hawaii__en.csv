I think it’s one of few if any hotels in that area which offers free parking . It works on first come first serve basis, however we never had a problem to find a spot. We enjoyed pool and sauna after long day around the island. Hotel personnel was very nice and friendly. We had cleaning service daily, and they did a good job, although we are not that messy.

There is a pool, a gym, and how many hotels actually provide FREE parking to the guests.There is no restaurant - so no room service.But you can get food and/or grocery delivery (just like at home) from DoorDash or GrubHub, or...)In fact, we did order and the delivery man brought the food to our door.We made the mistake of moving to the Outrigger Beach Resort, wanting to be on the beach and to have a restaurant in-house with room service.It was TOTALLY not worth the extra cost. In fact, the room service was sub-par. From the Illima, you are 2-3 blocks from the beach, one block from some really good restaurants, and one block from inexpensive city buses.

We were meeting friends for a cruise. I was not too crazy about the destination because I dont really like ""beach"" places. I prefer Europe. I had no idea, even after reading reviews after reviews, what type of accomodation we would find. I was very pleasently surprised. We were there 3 days before the cruise and 3 days after. The building is and older property but it is located right in Waikiki close to everything. For those who know the place it is right the next street from Seaside, between Kuhio and Ala Wai. Many shop and restaurants in the area.The hotel staff greeted us extremely well after that awful loooong flight and we learned that we would be on the 6th floor (606). I was afraid about the noise due to the proximity to the main streets, it wasnt too bad with the AC on. The room (efficiency) was really big. The kitchen area is well placed and the bathroom is the old style of bathroom with bath and shower together but it is very practical. There are minimal dishes, cutlery, pot, pan,stove, fridge, toaster and a small coffee maker. All was clean and in working order. The only minus I could see is that the fan in the bathroom is extremely noisy and it works with the light switch, so no way to leave it off. The other minus is that the Air Conditionning is of the old window type and although it work well, it is also very noisy. The hotel parking in an Inside parking, it is free and is first come-first serve basis. We never had a problem. I dont know how many suites they have but considering the amount of parking spaces, I see it as excellent. The staff is very friendly, helpful and makes sure that you are satisfied. The hotel offers some classes of different things, like lei making classes, hula classes.Unfortunately, we were not there on a Tuesday when the Lei making classes take place. When I told the reception agent, she told me that since we were back after the cruise, she would make us one, and, we got them. That is special!After the cruise we were assigned room 506, so , just below the one we had on our 3 first days. Exactly the same set up.I would definitely recommend this place.It is excellent value for money. Our friends stayed in another hotel, close by, which was supposed to be upscale but they had less than half the size of what we had and not as many facilities for much more than what we payed.Should I ever go back to Honolulu, they would definitely be my first choice.","Saint Jerome, Canada","Montrealeronthemove</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Jerome, Canada</strong>",161,5.0

The location is great. It's not too close to the beach where you have to deal with the noise. But it's close enough to the beach to walk. The hotel is also just a block from Duke's Lane Market and Eatery which is a nice place to grab some breakfast and coffee in the morning and bottled drinks in the evenings. The hotel also has a small kitchen in each room where you can cook small meals rather than go out to eat every meal which costs money. The employees of the hotel are just lovely! They are always friendly and try to be accommodating. Their communal computer was down and I needed to print a ticket for Peal Harbor that was in my email. They were nice enough to print it for me. They also had a free nut lei making class one morning. The ladies who taught that class were just delightful! They were a lot of fun. They even took a picture of me and my sister and my husband wearing our leis.Here's the but... parking is an issue and I'm not quite sure what the hotel can do about it. The parking stalls are far too narrow. Just about everyone parks over the line which will sometimes garner phone calls from the staff asking you to repark because you're over the line. When we were there, they were painting the parking garage. So, we had to move our vehicles constantly and because of the paining a handful of parking spaces were unavailable. There is a small lot across the street but it's not cheap. My advice... get a small rental car. They are easier to park between the lines.I am willing to stay there again because the positives at the hotel far outway the negative of the parking situation.

We like clean and safe, and this fit the bill. The room had a separate bedroom and a sofabed in the living room. Both were very comfortable, and the linens were very nice. It was nice to be able to spread out a little in a living room rather than just a bedroom. There were many windows, so we skipped the AC and let the breezes through. Our big balcony had a view of both the canal/hillside and the ocean, as well as a sliver of Diamond Head. It was so nice to sit on the balcony and have a drink. As mentioned in many reviews, the hotel is older, but this was fine with us because it was immaculate and reasonably priced. The location was great - Kuhio Avenue was at the other end of the block, and there are many restaurants and stores along it. The beach was only 2 blocks away, and the entire downtown Waikiki is walkable. Take the time to walk along the canal on Ala Wai Blvd, and look back at the great view of Diamond Head crater. For some fabulous food and a good time with other people, walk to the food trucks (left out the door, left onto Kuhio, and 3 blocks to Ka'iulani Ave). It's delicious, cheap, and fun, especially at night when the lights are on. Try the Kalua Pork at the first truck on the right, and the Pork Patty about 4 trucks on the left. We also had amazing fish and vegetarian tacos from a truck about halfway down on the right. The staff at this hotel were among the friendliest we've encountered - a nice smile and Aloha every time they saw us. They gave us lots of good information about the area, food, and buses.

Now we’re staying in a 2 bedroom until our house is ready. The place is big enough that we could stay here indefinitely and not go stir-crazy.The “full kitchen” has saved us a lot of money on food, but it leaves something to be desired. The small single basin sink is barely adequate for washing dishes for a family of four. We’re using paper plates to cut down on dishes. It was fine when I was by myself. They provide plenty of dishes, but cookware is a bit sparse. The refrigerator and freezer are pretty big, almost full size. The mattresses and pillows aren’t great, but this isn’t the Royal Hawaiian, so I wasn’t expecting much. I did buy a pillow, since we’ll be here a while. There isn’t a lot of room to unpack your clothes, and it seems like there are extra blankets and pillows in every drawer. We just piled them up in a closet. The bathroom is fine. The water pressure won’t knock your socks off, but the towels are good and the water is hot. Parking is free, that’s pretty awesome in Waikiki. They issue every guest who has a car a parking pass, and it’s first come, first served. The garage doesn’t always fill up, and you’re virtually guaranteed to get a spot if you’re in before 8. There are washers and dryers on the third floor, $2.50 to wash and $2.50 to dry. The pool is small, but great for kids. It’s kind of stashed between tall buildings, so rarely in direct sunlight (that’s good). The water temperature is inconsistent. Sometimes it’s just slightly chilly, more often it’s icy. There are sun decks on the 10th floor and the penthouse floor. Those are locked at 8pm. One small annoyance is the street that the hotel is on. There are a lot of one way streets in Waikiki. Nohonani is not one. But you can’t make a left onto it from Kuhio Avenue, forcing you to circle the block. Getting out of Waikiki is easy, it’s half a block to Ala Wai BLVD, and then a straight shot out. Waikiki beach is a couple blocks west, and there’s a grocery store, lots of high end shopping, and tons of restaurants and bars within two blocks. If you plan to get real use out of the kitchen, though, I recommend buying your groceries at the Target on Ala Moana BLVD, it’s 8 minutes by car and half the cost. The staff is amazing. Housekeeping and maintenance are friendly and efficient, but the front of the house really takes hospitality to another level. They raise this hotel from three stars to four.

The rest of the hotel was clean, thank goodness.We chose this hotel because it had a car/hotel bundle which saved us money, the reviews were not that bad (no concerns of pesky bugs) and it had a kitchen.

My husband has plenty of room to store his bike on the balcony and from here it is quick to get to Mount Tantulus for an exhilarating ride. The room is very large with one king and a double, so we can get alone time when we want. It’s spotlessly clean and the housekeeping staff ( thanks Savannah) are great. I especially like the Hawaiian feel here and how quiet it is in the lobby and by the pool. There are plenty of gray cafes and restaurants around as well as a Food Pantry if you want to eat in.

My main criteria for hotels are clean, healthy, safe (and good wifi), all met easily here. If your tastes are for ultra crisp Hyatts and similar it won't do the job for you, but that wasn't a problem for us. It could probably do with a multimillion dollar refurbishment to replace older surfaces that have been repainted too many times, older furniture and carpets though they are still clean and comfortable. The front desk is very friendly and helpful,had some experience with the back office which was the same. There is a free internet, computer, printer set up in the lobby that I probably overused, and the room wifi is strong. Our two bed room was very large with a dining table and chairs, kind of older fashioned kitchen set up, stuffed chair and a lanai (pictured) which though caught a lot of wind and wasn't as usable as I would have liked. If you rent a car in HNL - which I recommend, driving is not difficult and the rolling refrigerators of the bus system could kill you if you're not used to Arctic exploration (see my review elsewhere) - the parking here is free, although when we arrived at 11PM we got the last space available and it was a real squeeze (there is available public pay parking across the street).

In Feb , we stayed there for 7 nights before our cruise and 2 nights after (really 1 night and an extra day).Our Deluxe studio gave us a great mountain view and was plenty big enough for 3 adults (one King and one Queen Bed). We had a full kitchen which we used mainly for breakfast and snacks. Everything worked just fine. There is ample storage space.The beds were comfortable. Extra pillows were promptly and cheerfully supplied when requested. Lots of towels. Towels are supplied for the beach and pool, as are beach mats. Free coffee for the coffee maker.Hotel - General comments: This is an older and smaller but well-kept hotel. It is located about 1/2 block from Kuhio (all the major bus routes run along Kuhio - so it is especially convenient if you plan to use local transit) and about a 10 minute walk from Waikiki beach. This is a very good hotel for budget minded people who don't mind not being at a big resort on the beach.Housekeeping deserves a special mention. The room was spotless when we arrived and was very well-cleaned every day.Facilities we used:The small laundromat is very convenient and we used it twice. The front desk will sell you quarters and laundry detergent.Free WiFi - we used this a lot!Pool - the pool is small but was quite adequate to cool off in.Front Desk Staff - always helpful. Plenty of tourist brochures around and they will give you a local (Waikiki) map.What impressed us the most: When we returned from our cruise for our short pre flight home stay, our room was ready for us even though it was only about 10AM (They normally don't guarantee rooms until the afternoon - so this was such a pleasant surprise!)

You get a kitchen with a proper fridge, cooker, microwave oven, space to prepare food and a table to eat at.

Nobody comes to Hawaii to sit in their room all day looking out of the window.It may lack the historic grandeur of the Moana Surfrider or the legendary service of the Halekulani but it provides all the essentials for a great vacation at a fair price.Tip - although there are many convenience stores nearby such as the excellent Food Pantry, if catering on a budget you can save money by heading to the Safeway supermarket at 888 Kapahulu Ave, a 10-minute drive from the hotel or hop on the #13 bus southeast-bound on Kuhio which runs every 15 minutes.

The hotel has some age on it to be sure which felt a little odd for such a large structure. Our room was surprisingly large compared to most modern hotels. The kitchenette was a nice convenience but had the feel of a cabin-in-the-woods type kitchen with the old mini electric stove and very old cabinets but everything worked. It was also interesting that each room has a consumer type window AC unit retrofitted into the old louvered windows on the sides of the sliding glass door to the large balcony. It took the AC a while to cool the big room and while the balcony is a nice size, the roaring AC unit in the corner robs from relaxing and enjoying the view a bit. The bed was big and comfortable, the bathroom was clean with plenty of water pressure and hot water. The neighborhood was no worse than what I've dealt with elsewhere but I could see where it might make some a little uncomfortable. The walk to Waikiki Beach wasn't bad and there was a McDonalds about two blocks away where we like to go for breakfast. We walked or used Lyft to get around so I didn't have to deal with parking. Other people mentioned the elevators being slow which they were but not to the point of inconvenience. Staff was very friendly.

It was okay - pretty dated but mostly clean. I gave it 3 stars for a couple of reasons: Firstly, I was told I had paid in full before arriving and was hit with a $15 a day amenities fee. This was not in any correspondence I received. I was told this was for the WiFi and the tea and coffee. How I am charged for the 'free' WiFi they advertise is a puzzle to me, especially when the connection dropped out every few minutes. Secondly, the parking is a bit of a nightmare. There was a couple of spare parks, but inconsiderate parkers had put their car into two spaces with no other parks being free. I know this isn't the hotels fault. What is, though, is when we told the male desk attendant who was checking the car parking tags and his reply was, 'Well, if you hadn't already parked I would probably try to do something'. I thought this was pretty poor form considering he had just watched my husband struggle into the park for 5 minutes, could see the other car well over the line and watched my husband have to get out of the car through the passenger door, not to mention there was another car there over 2 car parks. They have everyone's registration and room number. On a positive note, the mountain view from our room was lovely and most of the hotel staff were very friendly. The desk staff when we checked in and the male attendant were all pretty ordinary. Overall, the hotel was okay for the price we paid and compared to the cost of other hotels but I really hate being hit with additional fees upon check in. I would have been even more ticked off if we hadn't been able to get a park because of the careless attitude of the desk attendant.","Townsville, Australia","Eaf23</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Townsville, Australia</strong>",8,3.0

The position suited us very well - just off the Ala Wai Blvd, a block away from the seething crowd of beachside hotels and the bustling Kalakaua Ave, our room overlooked the Ala Wai canal and golf course and had a fantastic postcard view of the hillside and Manoa valley. No huge buildings blocking our sight, the view of the lights on the hillside at night was simply magical. And the breeze, oh the breeze, it's probably one of our best memories of Hawaii - so lovely and cooling, we never had to use the airconditioning at all, and we could dry our our swimming gear easily on the balcony. This hotel may not be everyone's cup of tea especially those who want posh and plush hotels with designer toiletries and fancy accoutrements - and pay the exorbitant rates for it! This hotel is small and has an old, lived-in feeling and the charm, decor and ambience of a 60's style hotel, complete with pink carpets, bamboo chairs and wooden kitchen cupboards - it's certainly got character!We had a deluxe studio on the 15th floor and boy, it was huge! We have been to so many hotels all over the world and this one was definitely the most spacious we've stayed in. It had a king size bed and a double bed and a large open lounge area where we could spread out. And then of course, a fully equipped kitchenette with a big fridge, microwave, filter coffee maker, toaster and a full size electric stove (4 cooking rings and an oven). We even had a small dining table with chairs. These were all a godsend as we could start our day at a relaxed pace, eating breakfast at leisure (and knowing that we didn't have to fork out for a hotel buffet breakfast which are often too much and of poor value or walk the streets to find a cafe serving decent food). We saved heaps (and probably ate healthier) by going to the Food Pantry in the next block to stock up on fruits and yoghurts. The wifi signal in our room was consistently strong which meant we could regularly check our emails and even chat to our kids across the world. There is also a self-serve laundry on Level 3, full size washers and driers and good value at $2.50 a load. And oh, did I mention how comfortable the beds were? With the breeze, the view and a comfy bed, my husband said ""this place is just perfect for relaxing!"" - exactly what a holiday is all about! I must also mention how nice all the staff were in this hotel. I was bowled over by their friendly disposition, we were welcomed like old friends and in the end, like family. The ladies in the front office: Emily and Remy, deserve bouquets for accommodating our simple requests, nothing is too hard, all accomplished with a smile. Overall, when it comes to value, location, service and comfort, I'd say this hotel ticks all the boxes, I'd recommend it to many except that it may get too popular that it won't have room for us the next time. I really hope it doesn't change, this is just my kind of hotel.(I was delighted to discover that this hotel is just a 4-minute walk around the corner to Ross Dress for Less, my idea of fashion shopping heaven, cheap and cheerful!).","Queensland, Australia","geckopoo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Queensland, Australia</strong>",213,5.0

There's a tiny pool on the ground floor and a seperate sun deck on a higher level (but why sit there when you have the beach!) It is set 3 blocks back from the Royal Hawaiian with the canal right behind - which is good for running along in the mornings. It is only about 5 mins walk to the beach but the street has a few low-rate hotels in it so is a bit shabby and you have to walk through the Holiday Inn alleyway - or Duke's open marketplace (cheap trinkets) to get to and from the beach. It is close to a v popular Japanese restaurant and Hola Hola mini market which is handy. Waikiki is very crowded and expensive so this place is a good find to save a bit of money and get away from the crowds. Ask for a room above level 8 (there's 16 floors) as we were on level 4 and stared at car parks and shabby buildings.

However, if you get your head around these facts and compare the rates with other establishments newer/nearer it really starts to look like a good deal!We had no problem with the location. Everything is easily walkable (Waikiki has very good pedestrian facilities). 10 mins to the beach, 5 to the nearest mall and 2 around the corner to the nearest restaurant. Bus stops to/from Honolulu are a minute away.Yes, it is dated, but not in any way dirty. It was actually quite fitting with the tiki-tacky atmosphere of Waikiki anyway! Pink wallpaper, bamboo furniture etc. Our room was enormous with 2 beds, a kitchenette and a balcony (and I had booked the cheapest option). Our previous lodgings had no hot water, so we really appreciated a proper shower! Only problem was the ancient a/c, which was oddly at floor level on a corner of the room and didn't really do much but make noise.Overall we had a positive experience. The service was lovely. I read from some previous reviews that this is one of the only remaining independent local hotels and you could really feel that.Yes, it could be so much nicer, but unless you intend to not step outside your room and/or have piles of extra money lying around, it's a solid choice!","London, United Kingdom","undome</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",49,3.0

We booked this hotel for 6 nights primarily because it did not have a daily parking fee and the reviews on Trip Advisor seemed favorable for the most part. At first glance, the exterior is looking a bit rundown but nostalgic looking. The lobby was pleasant and the lady who checked us in was very friendly, however she was unable to accommodate my request for a canal facing room on a higher floor. Based on reviews on this site, we weren't expecting a 5-star hotel. However, upon entering our ""superior studio suite"" it was obvious that this property had not been updated in decades. I don't even know where to begin! The cupboards and cabinetry were so old I think my Grandfather had the same ones in his garage for tools. The stove was straight out of the 1960's with tinfoil under the burners. There was a single sink and small counter with chips in the top. The carpet/linoleum was worn and stained. The bathroom did not have a vanity - just a skinny metal shelf above a pedestal sink. The furniture was dated and worn. There was a newer flat screen television but it was only maybe a 32"". In one corner, there was an old safe with a sign taped to it that said ""Do not use - there is another safe in the closet"". There were three ""deadbolts"" on the door - none of which worked properly. The bright pink and peeling balcony contained two plastic chairs and overlooked what appeared to be the ""ghetto: of Waikiki. Our view consisted of low income rental properties and their balconies loaded with junk and laundry hanging on railings. We observed a dude scratching his belly and sorting his bottles. The air conditioning unit had moldy foam stuffed around it. To top it all off, the distinct smell of pot wafted through the ventilation system at one point. That was the icing on the cake for us! After not being able to access their free wi-fi and having to phone the local internet provider to remedy this problem, we were able to secure another room at a much better property (4.5 star) with a view of the ocean and Diamond Head and overlooking a beautiful park for the same price per night!! Yes, we did have to pay a daily parking fee at the new property but it was so worth it in the end. We never would have enjoyed a minute had we stayed at the Ilima! The front desk lady at the Ilima was very nice when we explained we were not going to be staying. She was apologetic but unfortunately there was nothing she could have done to entice us to stay. It was that bad! In the end, we were charged for one night as well as a day of their ""resort fee"" to cancel but we did not care. My suggestion to anyone looking to stay in Waikiki area is to really do your homework. It is an expensive destination and most hotels do charge for parking. However, room rates in better properties can be comparable and sometimes even cheaper than the Ilima. Do not try to cut corners to avoid paying the parking at a better place - it is not worth your peace of mind and will make for a much more comfortable and enjoyable vacation in the end.",Edmonton,"Moester3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton</strong>",11,2.0

The property is definitely aging and could use a total renovation. But everything worked and I was completely comfortable for my entire stay.

I needed something walking distance to the beach, two beds, and wasn't going to cost the world for a week.'Ilima was perfect!The rooms are HUGE! so you have heaps of room to spread out post a day at the beach or shopping. The full kitchen means you can save money on food and drinks and can pack picnics when you go to the beach.Being a girls' week away, we needed lots of mirrors - check, lots of towels - check, good water pressure to wash our hair - check, and plenty of hanging space - check. Added to this was the fantastic view from the balcony (lanai), the pool and sunbathing areas, loads of windows for natural light, plus lots of lights/lamps in the rooms.I had read some reviews that weren't too favourable, but seriously don't understand how anyone could not like this place. The decor is a bit dated, but this adds to the charm of a vacation, and everything was spotless with excellent housekeeping (I've stayed in supposedly better hotels and found them grotty).There is a car rental across the street. you are literally two minutes from the heart of the tourist district straight down Duke's Lane. There is a Food Pantry the next block over for stocking the kitchen, but the little 7/11 style shop two doors down is well stocked and cheap. There is a bar two doors down where the people were very friendly and respectful (I don't understand the negative comments I had read about the the neighbourhood, every night my girlfriend and I walked past the bar and not once were we heckled). And the kitchen had all the utensils, glasses, plates etc you could possibly need.But enough about the room, you go to Waikiki for the beach, sites and culture. Ilima has ample free beach towels and beach mats - you just grab fresh ones on your way out each day. The hotel is an easy walk to all the local beaches. There is a tour information desk in the lobby and the reception staff will bend over backwards to help you. There is ample undercover parking and a full guest laundry. I'd suggest saving the money on using the dryers and just hang your clothes on the balcony over night. The hotel offers guest events too, like singalongs and lei making. They also have a luggage scale so you don't get stung by fees at the airport.All in all, I was very impressed with the 'Ilima. I've stayed at other 'budget' hotels in Waikiki and this one is definitely the best. Considering the room size, full kitchen and excellent staff, I would rate 'Ilima above a lot of the more expensive four star hotels.Being Australian, I'm not so fussy about having a breakfast restaurant in the hotel. But I know my American friends are big on their breakfasts. Don't fear, if you don't want to use your own kitchen there is an IHOP down the street, a Starbucks on the corner, and hundreds of other excellent cheap breakfast option you can pick up on you way back from an early morning swim or run on the beach. I can recommend the Seaside Cafe for super cheap but good quality food.Oh, almost forgot, Good free wifi and no resort fees!!! And did I mention, the rooms are HUGE!Seriously, for the price, this place was great. It also has so much character - everyone knows the 'Ilima - ""it's the pink one, right?""

Plus with the kitchen, free parking and internet this was a great deal. The best part of Ilima though is the staff. They are always super-friendly and helpful.

It's only a short walk to the best (less crowded) part of Waikiki beach and there are tons of food and shopping options within a short walk.

Not a big deal and the room was very clean, but it looked unattractive. There's also a pretty rowdy bar right next to Ilima.

My husband, daughter, and I felt we found a home away from home with the Ilima Hotel. Our room was a simple studio with a kitchenette, not a lot of extras, but it worked for us! Though a breakfast is not offered, this hotel is much less expensive than those that do. The Food Pantry is about a quarter mile away with reasonable prices compared to the ABC stores so this is where we got our breakfast and sometimes dinner supplies. Every time you walk into the lobby, you are greeted with a friendly ""Aloha!"" and a much welcome blast of air conditioning! The staff couldn't be kinder. Every Wednesday, the staff offeres complimentary lei making with kukui nuts for hotel guests from 10-11 a.m.. Our daughter's 13th birthday was on a Wednesday, but we were unavailable to take advantage of it, so I asked the folks at the front desk if they could set aside some supplies for my daughter so she could make one on her own. I was told they'd check and get back to me. When my husband returned from a trip to the post office, the front desk person gave him a small baggie full of everything my daughter needed to make her own lei. Also, two days later, when we were checking out, our daughter was given a shell lei, unlike the ones you get at other attractions at the area. If we ever have the good fortune to go back to Oahu, I want to go back! Thank you all, so much, for making us feel at home!","Spokane, Washington","JeniG1989</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Spokane, Washington</strong>",4,5.0

As others have pointed out this is an older hotel in need of refreshing. The carpeting is a little stained, the wallpaper peeling in spots, older appliances - a little rough around the edges for sure. The trade-off is a large spacious room with a full working kitchen and lanai, free parking, pool (although small), sauna (again small but great to have), good location, good bathroom and terrific staff all at an attractive price. A few months earlier we stayed at the Parc Wakiki (lovely but $$$$) but I have to say overall this was a more enjoyable (and practical) stay. Although a little funkier, I like the area better. It felt more ""local"". The beds were comfortable with very good pillows. The only negative was the major construction going on directly in front of the ocean view side: a new large hotel and a new 4 story market place set to open sometime in 2016. (There is major construction going on all over Wakiki: be warned). If you expect to sit out on your lanai between 9-4pm you will hear a lot of jackhammering and construction noise. We got up early and spent most of the day out. The beach is a short walk away and there are some very good Japanese restaurants nearby. A full-size supermarket is just a few blocks away. We used the kitchen and overall enjoyed our stay here.

We were in room 1201 (12th floor) overlooking the golf course & canal - lovely view sitting out on our small veranda having happy hour before we went out for dinner.

There is no resort fee. The pool is small but adequate and clean with pool towels. There was only one lift working but didn't bother us. There is a seedy bar at night you might pass to get to the restaurant, beach, shopping area. To avoid passing it walk on the opposite side of the road or street adjacent to get to the hotel if this bothers you. We walked straight pass the bar quickly and had no concerns. We are budget conscience, in our late 50's and loved the hotel. If you stay closer to the beach you will be paying triple the price and resort fees.

There were periods of waiting literally 10 mins only to have a full elevator arrive. (They are re-doing the 2nd elevator - so no idea when that one will be functioning.)

Running the AC also helped cut out the noise.Parking is tight, but free which is a rarity in Waikiki. Knowing that ahead of time means we rent a smaller compact car. The location near the canal means easier access to H1, no matter which direction you are heading to on Oahu.The kitchenette is very convenient to cut down on the cost of your stay.

I was greeted with genuine smiles and was attended to immediately. The reassuring staff went the extra mile answering my questions and gave us a lot of personal attention. I had originally reserved a room for 3 nights, but asked if they could accommodate us for a longer period of time. I knew it wasn’t going to be easy during the high season, but they found a room for me and it even was a better price!They really did go out of their way to make me feel at home. I attended the “sing-along” on Friday morning. The staff handed out binders of Hawaiian song lyrics so guests could sing along (or just watch and enjoy). The staff sang beautifully and were accompanied by live bass fiddle, guitar and ukulele. It was lovely and fun!I signed up for their free craft class, held on Wednesday mornings. It was just an hour, and we all made lei’s from kakui nuts and shells. You have your choice of many different colored kakui nuts. I highly recommend it.Every room, other than the penthouse units, are the same. They are quite spacious (approx. 1000 sf (93 m2) including the bathroom area). Each room has a balcony and some kind of view. Our view faced the ocean, but was mostly blocked by taller hotels. There was a major building construction project going on (and will continue until about March 2016) and we actually enjoyed watching them work. We made a time-lapse movie of the trucks, dozers and cranes at work all day long. On Friday nights, Waikiki puts on a fireworks show. We could see it from our lanai. There are also viewing decks on the 10th and Penthouse levels. There is a small, outdoor, heated pool, sauna, coin-operated washers and dryers and other amenities. Every room has a kitchenette. My rooms (1604 and 907) had very basic kitchen equipment and no dishwasher. There are pots and pans, dishes, glasses, silverware, a tiny coffee maker and toaster. The hotel does not stock plastic wrap, foil, paper towels, coffee filters, salt, pepper, sugar or anything else consumable. If you like making your own coffee, buy it ground. If you think you might want to use a measuring cup, measuring spoons, a vegetable peeler, grater, or a baking pan, you will have to provide them yourself.Our rooms were perfectly clean. Bed linens were high quality and seemed new. Towels were extremely plush. The hotel provides beach towels and beach mats (tatami) to guests as well.The WIFI was very good. We were able to stream videos without a hiccup. The room was equipped with a large flat screen TV that had HDMI cables (we used it as a computer monitor).If you like a room that gets warm, ask for one that faces south. If it gets hot from the sunshine pouring in your room, you can open the large sliding doors or run the air conditioning.The downside is the loud city noise. This is not the hotel’s fault; in fact, every hotel in the city is surrounded by the same noise, 24/7. This is Honolulu, after all. It was a bit louder on the ninth floor than it was on the sixteenth floor. We closed the doors and ran the air conditioner which greatly reduced the noise. This was the only way we could sleep.This hotel is in a great location, only 2 ½ blocks from Waikiki Beach, 2 blocks from Food Pantry for groceries, and 1 or 2 blocks from bus-stops that take you all over the island for far less money than the tours charge. Consider ditching the car rental and exploring the area via TheBus.If you do drive a car here, you’ll be pleased to know that the hotel has a free parking garage for guests, which most hotels do not have.We saw no insects in the hotel the entire 2 weeks we were there.I recommend this hotel for visitors who don't mind somewhat dated decor and reasonable prices.

We needed a minimum of two bedrooms and preferably three and would not consider a place that listed the living room with sofa bed as one of the bedrooms. We began our search in early July and already the options were few and far between. Hawaii has been having a problem with short term lets and has been trying to clamp down on the casual rental business, without a lot of success. Minimum rental periods of one month were the most legitimate on offer and there was only a limited supply of these. Reports of scams where people paid deposits on properties that were never on the market in the first place were not encouraging. The Ilima Hotel has penthouse apartments and we started to look at this option seriously. Penthouse A (PHA) and Penthouse B could be linked to provide two plus one bedrooms, with a separate living and dining room and full kitchen. There would be sufficient beds to sleep eight. more if you used the living room. There was one full sized bathroom in each section as well as one washing machine and free standing dryer. Each apartment had its own WiFi router with free access. A big plus was free on-site parking although it was on a daily first-come first-served basis. Also a weekday newspaper was delivered each morning. It was a pity that they charge $3 a day for the use of the room safe, it seemed a mean-spirited charge when WIFI was free. We locked passports inside one of our bags. The Ilima Hotel is not one of the big names on the Waikiki scene and the property has been around for a good while. It is a sixteen story block and the Penthouses are on floor seventeen. Level thirteen seemed to have got lost. It is located only two blocks behind the main Waikiki street, Kalakaua Avenue, that could be reached in an easy five minute walk. Even closer was Kuhio Avenue with bus stops for The Bus, the efficient Hawaii transit system, and other shuttle transport. The apartments face the ocean that could be glimpsed between various tall buildings. Directly in front was a massive construction site where the International Market once stood. All the work going on there was still at ground level but if a tall building is to go up it will limit the views more. Construction noise was heard on and off, as was early morning garbage collection. The linked apartments turned out to be a great find. For four people it was spacious and supremely comfortable and would have been so for six. PHB could be easily isolated temporarily in the evening and would be ideal for up to four children if they could all sleep in two very large beds while their parents could have a double room each as well as a generous living room. The kitchen had a large refrigerator, full sized stove, microwave oven and a waste disposal unit. The cutlery, crockery, glassware and kitchen utensils were rather sparsely supplied. Four guests stretched what was available and we made do by buying paper plates to eke out the mismatched crockery and drank our wine from tumblers. Some matched crockery and well chosen glassware would be classy and work wonders.Each of the rooms was individually air conditioned. The units were silent and efficient. December is the Hawaiian winter so we needed air conditioning only infrequently, mostly in the late afternoon when there was full sun on the balcony windows. There was a small balcony with furnishings outside each room and it was a pleasant location to take drinks in the late afternoon or evening. The penthouse level also had a large terrace carpeted with green astroturf and furnished with sun loungers. There was a good supermarket five minutes away and a huge Safeway a few stops away on The Bus from our corner. The Penthouses are let as Hotel rooms, with daily service including Christmas Day. They were generous with towels, clearing garbage, and frequent linen changes.All sixteen floors are serviced by two lifts and except in the early morning around check-out time there were never delays. Guests joining and leaving the lifts included lots of families sometimes with a surf board or other beach gear. Our experience was good. The hotel is quiet except for some modest external noise and it is well run with friendly helpful staff.

The in suite washer and dryer are tiny (fits two pairs of jeans and four t-shirts in a load), but don't require coins. Both of our washrooms had very deep jetted tubs. The only downside is that my preschooler had to be lifted high to get in and out, I can imagine that someone shorter than my 5.5 feet or not so nimble might find it difficult but there are hand holds on the shower walls.The top floor hallway (and maybe all floors, I don't know) is open to the outdoors with wide spaced metal bars to keep you in. The same wide spaced bars were on each lanai. My child stuck her head between the bars to have a better look and that was the end of our using the lanai as none of us wanted her to plummet to her death. We kept the doors locked and told her the lanai were haunted and it was never an issue with her going out there.The kukui nut lei making class was better than expected and was fun for all of us. We left with gorgeous leis made with glossy painted kukui nuts and coloured shells.Decorating the lobby are obscenely ridiculous paintings of nearly nude men and women in quasi erotic poses which made us giggle every time we came and left the hotel. It made the hotel memorable!The outdoor pool is small and doesn't appear to see much use, but why would it? The beach is a short walk away. The gym hardly deserves to be called a gym as it is really just a low ceilinged converted storage closet with two beat up old exercise machines inside. Some of that might sound awful, but it really wasn't. I liked the older decor in my room, I felt like I was staying at an auntie's beach house instead of a hotel. The hotel staff were kind and responsive to our needs. The check in and check out processes were simple and fast. The maintenance and housekeeping staff were thorough and friendly. The parking was free and the lot wasn't as frighteningly tight as I had anticipated and we parked our Dodge Caravan without trouble every night.We will be returning to the Ilima for our next Hawaiian vacation and telling anyone who will listen about how great our stay was.

I know this is going to be a long review, but please take the time to read it as I have nothing but praise for the hotel and staff. We stayed there for 2 weeks and had a great time. The hotel was just lovely, clean and very comfortable. Our room was so spacious and having kitchen facilities helped with the occasional breakfast/ dinner. We booked our room directly through the hotel website, and as such, the price was more competitive. In doing so, I was able to be in contact with the booking staff and specified that we would like a room on the 16th floor - with canal/mountain views. The lady was so accommodating and answered every question that I had, and this was months before our actual trip. When we arrived, our room was so spacious, clean, comfortable. Staff were so friendly, everyone of them from reception to housekeeping - we were always greeted cheerfully and everyone was willing to stop and have a word. Any question regarding transport, getting around, shopping etc was answered patiently and we were provided with maps, directions etc. Our first day at the hotel, we couldn't get the microwave to start and contacted reception early in the morning. Within minutes someone was sent up to have a look and fix it. At the time, our fridge started making a loud noise - they replaced the fridge!!! The service we got was just sensational. They have free lei making classes every Wednesday which i would highly recommend. The hotel staff also have a choir that sings every Friday; this was really special and again, if you stay at the Ilima, you must watch them. There have been a few negative reviews on the hotel, but when we were there, none of them seemed valid. Yes, there is a pub a few doors down from the hotel, and you might be a bit wary about walking past it at night, but you can easily get around this issue by coming to the hotel from the Ala Wai end of Nohonani street rather than the Kuhio end. That is what we did, we walked up one of the other streets eg. Seaside avenue. There have also been negative comments re the room decor, colour. Again, these just did not appear valid to us. The views from the room were just spectacular and we spent every morning having breakfast on the 'lanai', looking out on to the canal and mountains.A few tips: eating out in waikiki can be expensive till we discovered restaurants on Kapahulu street. It is a bit of a walk from the Ilima (30mins), but so worth it. To name a few, uncle Bo's pupu bar and grill, the blue water shrimp and seafood truck - we had amazing food there. It is just a blue truck (opposite Lennard's bakery). They have just 5 items that you can order, but the shrimps were delicious and food was so cheap. Another must is the Malasadas from Lennard's Bakery. I've never tasted doughnuts like that before. Another place is Side Street Inn. Just walk down Kapahulu and you will find lots of lovely places to eat. And don't forget to eat at Marukame Udon - a Japanese restaurant just round the corner from Ilima. The long queues will give it away. Get there early - around 5.15pm. Having said that, the queue moves very quickly.And finally, there is free entertainment almost every evening from 6-7pm at the Royal Hawaiian Grove at the Royal Hawaiian Centre. The Friday evening performance is especially good and you can buy the CD after the show for $15. Get there early to get a good seating spot if you would like to record the performance. Don't forget to attend the Rock a Hula show and Fourever Fab. These are paid performances, but well worth it.A big thank you to all the staff at Ilima - we had a wonderful holiday !",,Patricia R,17,5.0

The small pool area was immaculate and the water crystal clear.Every member of staff, from front desk to housekeeping, greeted us with a smile and a cheery hello or wave whenever we saw them.

So I can/will equally give 5 stars to a ""budget"" hotel as I would a fancy resort. OK onto the review.Disclosure: our friend is good friends with the GM so we got a ""friends and family"" rate, much less advertised than any website etc. during their 2nd busiest month of the year. While that made our vacation an even greater value, I don't think it affected service, meaning, I believe they treat EVERYONE as VIP (although, I'd like to think we're special lol ;)Location 4.5 stars: approx 3 blocks/10 min walk to Waikiki beach (if it was beachfront, it'd get 5 stars, but guess what? You'll pay much more!). For us it was a practical location: 2 blocks from Food Pantry, within walking distance of all shops/restaurants and across the sreet the little ""alley swap meet"" where I got a whole bunch of souveniers at a fraction of the cost of ABC stores/Walmart etc. Also across the street is a store (can't remember the name) that sells shirts 8 for $19.99.Since we didn't have a rental car, the location was great for us b/c we walked everywhere and all places conveniently located.Hotel/Service 5 stars: It is an older hotel, as you can see from their website/other reviewers, but it was comfortable, very clean and kept up nicely. Our room was a superior King (see their website for pics) which included a King & double beds and a full kitchenette (full sized fridge, stovetop and microwave) complete w/ dining table. This kitchenette was for us, an important feature for our 1 week stay. We wanted a good value to save money (I'd rather spend less on a hotel/food and use the savings for healthier eating, shopping/excursions etc.). It was very clean, no bugs or anything like that. Also comes with utensils, cooking utensils, plates/cups etc.). We saved $$$ by stocking our fridge.The AC is a wall unit and it kept our entire studio room nice and cool. 2 big closets/plenty of hangers, shelves, etc.Bathroom: has a bathtub, it's clean, basic. Comes with toiletries (shampoo, soap, face wipes, shower caps). Comfortable temperature even though no AC in bathroom.We requested the highest floor possible (got 15th floor) that was quiet and facing canal (see pic of view of balcony, very nice). You can hear sirens of driving by but other than that, very quiet.Beds: firm mattress (which I like), comfy and clean :)Service: BEST housekeeping, we just called when ready to leave to request the time we wanted our room refreshed. They always provided extra towels and toiletries per our request. Sometimes if I needed something in the evening, they'd send someone up right away (unlike other hotels where their housekeeping takes forever, or sometimes don't even show up). Made me feel like we were the only guests they were catering to :)Front desk, we got to know some workers more than others but all were extremely friendly. We just loved Nicole, who on our last morning said she wanted to invite us to her place for breakfast (but we had to go to airport). I let her know we'd host her when she visits So Cal :) She felt like family.Courtni reservations: Awesome in booking our room and providing all of our requests for quiet, highest floor, non smoking etc. Super friendly (in fact, just spoke w/ her this week to book our next visit there...which reminded me that I needed to post my review :)General Manager: Phil Sammer, GREAT GM, you can tell he does a great job in how his employees treat guests. They seem more like a family/team, than ""workers"". Very impressive. Again, he knew we were friends of his friend, but based on other reviews, I think this is how they treat everyone. I love the friendliness and service at Ilima.For value minded travellers who aren't in the hotel much, and do not mind that it's not ""on the beach"", it is a great way to have an affordable trip in the heart of Waikiki. This hotel had EVERYTHING we specifically wanted/needed in our hotel room. We didn't experience any problems whatsoever during our 8 day stay. Other amenities/perks: - Free lei making class (which I need to partake in next time :)- Free parking (we didn't use b/c no rental car)- Partner w/ Ilima Shuttle (800-713-0146) we got airport shuttle for $11 per person HNL to hotel and $10 per person hotel to HNL airport. You can probably get it a few bucks cheaper elsewhere, but this was a recommended company from the hotel so we used them for reliability. They were great/on time etc.- Coin operated laundry (didn't use)- Litlte fitness center (didn't use)- Beach mats at front desk- Free WI-FI in the roomsOverall, a great value, EXCELLENT service and for us, we couldn't ask for more. Having said that, there's no such thing as perfect and what would make them even better (based on other reviewers comments too), few tiny little things:- Fresh coat of paint to ""modernize"" the rooms. I think this would make a big difference to reviewers commenting on the rooms being ""dated""- Eliminate the daily safe fee. It's an item already in the room that bears the hotel no cost in allowing guest usage so I think people who don't like to feel ""nickel & dimed"" would give them higher ratings if this $2.75/day were removed. This was mentioned alot by other reviewers. For us, we avoided the charge by simply bringing a lock for our luggage to lock up our iPad & passports.- Provide free coffee packs in rooms like all hotels do (for us, we didn't care b/c we aren't coffee drinkers but I saw alot of comments on this one too)- Allow free printing of boarding passes (most hotels do this)Whether an overnight stay or an extended vacation, the Ilima hotel will suit your needs. We can't wait to go back in 6 months. They are awesome and I'll be bringing them goodies from So Cal :)Aloha & Mahalo :)",Southern California,"SoCalTravelGal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southern California</strong>",364,5.0

The staff is very friendly and helpful. Check in/out was easy and quick. All the times I've stayed here, it was quiet. The hotel has studios, 1-3 bedrooms and a penthouse I think comes with four bedrooms, but not sure, check the website. I stayed in a deluxe studio that had both a king and double size beds. The room is very comfortable and clean. There is a nice size refrigerator with freezer top. Also has a stove and there is cooking and eating utensils in the room, so you can save some money and make your own food instead of eating out that could be pricey. If you like seeing the ocean from your balcony, then this is not the place for you. The only views it offers is a mountain or Waikiki city (basically surrounding buildings) views, depending on which side of the building you stay in ( the best is the mauka or mountain view), but that's why a room is just to relax and refresh yourself, not to view Hawaii from inside. Keep in mind, if you want a room with a ocean view, its more expensive. There is a sundeck on the 10th floor and if you go there on a Friday night, you can see the Hilton Hawaiian Village fireworks show (check with the hotel staff for start time).
