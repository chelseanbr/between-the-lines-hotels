The room smelled like corn chips and some funky tangy spoiled dip. Had to freshen it up with some febreze and Giovanni Versace cologne oh yes yes! The playstation was an nice upgrade it needs an new controller left an good movie in there hopefully someone will enjoy it. The room and the entire hotel is overdue for renovations all over as well as updated amenities. Almost slipped and fell out of the tub, there is no made in rough surface mat that is needed to assure guests won't injure themselves trying to clean them selves up. The was alot of dust and debree everywhere as well as broken or disabled hangers that can cause major health problems and insurable risks to guests and employees. The windows where needing cleaning and didn't provide an good outlook or view to the ocean or city area. The carpet smelled very musty and a few stains where in there and it seemed contagious as well as an few insects flying around mating on anything they wanted to mate on. The bed was comfy although the sheets and covers smelled like tobacco products felt like I was dumped into an astray next to an filthy trash can. The microwave worked although it was handicapped in remembering how many seconds to heat up my eatable items and it smelled like melting plastic so I threw away my hot food and was forced to buy an tuna sandwich from the convenience store right under my room. The convenience store looked okay from the outside although inside it smelled like there was an power outage, the floors need sweeping and mopping and products properly placed on the shelves instead of the floor that was kinda unsanitary to the fullest degree. Some of the products was out of date and warm when they should of been cold dripping wet. The elevator seemed okay although it was faulty and felt like an amusement park ride with out the seat belt.

Not sure what was going on with the smoke detector, but there was a washcloth over it. The bathroom door was so dirty on both sides. There isn't a chain lock on the front door, and I just didn't feel very safe here. The area isn't the best area either, but it is close to the Walmart. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because they offer free movie rentals at the vending machine and have a PlayStation 3 in the room.

The views are good and shower was great and nice and hot! I didn't have the dinner buffet, but the breakfast buffet is delicious and priced right. All of the staff were very friendly. I only had two issues while there: A minor cleanliness issue in my first room, which when I told the front desk agent (didn't get her name) she immediately moved me to another room with a smile. Also, I could not get the tv off of anything but the menu screen - none of the remote buttons did anything - but did not bother to mention it as I decided to just go to bed. The neighborhood was decent, with several good restaurants nearby as well as some fast food and WalMart for supplies and the hotel also has a shop for supplies and gifts.

We came to the Pagoda Hotel for a 2 day conference. It was suggested we stay at the Pagoda and were offered a special rate for our stay which added up to $179 per night. We were given a ""deluxe"" room. On the 12 th floor, we found our room and entered to immediately notice a moldy smell. The carpet at the end of the bed was in a small depression, and the carpet itself was wet and spongy. On the interior of the A/C window unit you could see it was covered with black mold, and there was actually a huge - 1/4 inch mold spore hanging on the edge of the window frame, just above the a/c unit. There was mold coming through the paint on the ceilings, walls, and in the shower the mat was circled with mold. It looked as if a recent paint job had been intended to cover the mold seeping through. Attending our conference in the room above the Koi pond was no better - mold smell blowing all day through the a/c, with many of the attendees complaining about trouble breathing, raspy throats, and hoarse voices by day 2. By the end of our stay I was so sick that I was unable to speak directly with the hotel staff, altho they did a great job of ignoring us as we checked out and waited for our ride to the airport. Now that I am home and beginning to feel better, I am following up so no one else has to experience this dangerous place. MY ADVICE IS DO NOT STAY HERE. MOLD EXPOSURE IS EXTREMELY HIGH.

I was excited to spend the weekend here because of the location, size, convenience and atmosphere. I don't enjoy gigantic buildings and properties that take you all day to navigate with a map, and through large crowds of people, where everyone is just blended together. The Pagoda Hotel offered all the comforts of home which I appreciate and prefer. The elevators to the rooms is a quick few steps away from the front desk. The public spaces were clean, well kept and always had a great smell to them. It was nice and cozy, simple and enjoyable. Our room was clean and well put together with more than enough space to enjoy but also to feel relaxed in. Convenient location allowed us to simply walk to different eateries around the area whenever we felt. Parking was simple. Shop located in lobby with so many things to choose from. There was power outage on the block our first nigh there, but there was no panick anywhere. Hotel staff were addressing things well and when we were able to confirm our safety, we ended up going right back to bed. It felt so great to relax and I want to thank Hotel Manager Paul and staff for helping me celebrate my birthday. Paul even took the time to wish me a Happy Birthday in a hand written letter.

Countertops were of some industrial-grade fabrication, not attractive at all. Discounts were available for guests at their adjacent restaurant. The food was just okay--many of the buffet offerings were cold when they should have been hot (cold scrambled eggs). Staff in the hotel as well as the restaurant were very good. The Pagoda offers a lesser price for stays in Honolulu, including a pool and nice landscaping. They have a caveat about bugs in the room, which didn't bother me.

On a final note, I must add that the owner of this hotel, Peter Savio, has to my knowledge, single-handedly done more in supplying affordable homes to local residents here on Oahu than any other individual over the past decade--which I take to mean that he is more interested in helping people than making a killing in real estate investment, which I honestly believe has a positive trickle down effect on the friendly and accommodating staff at Pagoda.

One of the best amenities with the Pagoda is that the room rate includes free shuttle to Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana Shopping Center (and anywhere in between) and back every half hour from about 9a.m. to 9p.m. Overall, our stay was fine, no complaints or unhappy surprises and the price was right. I would stay at the Pagoda again if it was a short stay, but probably not for a longer vacation where I'd prefer a little more luxury and a place closer to the beach.","Metro Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota","C K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Metro Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota</strong>",1,3.0

It looked nice enough from the online photos, so we decided to stay. Our room was large and had a king-size bed. It had a window air conditioner which worked well. That's the good news. The entire hotel needs to be updated. It is in downtown Honolulu, far from the popular Waikiki Beach area. There are not a lot of restaurants around the hotel, except their own on-site restaurant, which has old facilities and limited selection. It is conveniently located near a WalMart and a Walgreen's and local grocery stores. On a brighter note, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. From check-in to check-out, we were treated very well. Another plus was the DVD rental program which was included in the room rate. We watched a different movie every night. However, during the week we stayed there, the water was turned off completely during one weekday morning and the hallway carpeting was replaced over four days. Next time, we will personally pay the difference and stay at a higher class hotel (Hilton Waikiki Beach Resort or the Ala Moana).

If you want to bring a car, parking is $10 a day at the parking garage across the street (the garage is shared with the Ross store). Amenities include a small pool, air conditioning, and access to new release DVDs (there is a small kiosk in the lobby). The hotel room I stayed in was clean and maintained well. There is no free breakfast, but there is a breakfast buffet ($10/person if you're a hotel guest at Pagoda) a half block down at the Pagoda restaurant.

The return to the airport by taxi for two persons was only a couple dollars more than the shuttle. My husband and I stayed two nights at the hotel before our cruise around the islands and one night after the cruise. The price was very reasonable in comparison to many of the other hotels nearby. For a first time visitor to the hotel, the major construction work can be very disconcerting. The Reception desk is temporarily located in a very small room in the back of the property. This meant going through a dim passageway to get to the main portion of the hotel and the elevators. This was somewhat of a negative, but our purpose for being in Honolulu was to visit the city and see the sights rather than spend the day in a luxury hotel. Although a budget hotel, we found the rooms to be pleasingly comfortable once we were inside despite the need for some minor work. Any negative impressions were totally made up by the friendliness of the staff. Everyone was so accommodating and helpful. We did not have an opportunity to eat in the restaurant, but were impressed by its unique style --floating with waterfalls and ponds. A list of items covered in the daily convenience fee was posted at the front desk. The two of value to us were the wireless internet service and the free shuttle to Waikiki.

Looking at the reviews for this hotel, I expected that it would be a clean place but nothing special. And I was right. The location of the hotel makes it easy to walk to the Ala Moana Shopping Center and the numerous shops/restaurants in the area but the room could have been much better. The room was clean but the A/C wall unit had a large gap running around where it met with the window frame. It was large enough that traffic and conversation noise from the street could easily be heard. And I was on the 11th floor! Also, there were several mismatched paint spots above the bed and the bathtub surface was peeling. At least these cosmetic issues will be addressed on February 23rd when the hotel goes through a major renovation to bring the hotel back to its former glory according to the employees and locals I spoke to. Be prepared that if you think you will have wireless Internet access in your room, you will be wrong. The hotel only provides wireless Internet at their lobby area. Free Internet access in your room is only via Ethernet cable. So only your computer will work. Smartphones, iPhones and tablets are left without a connection. Getting past the cosmetic issues of the room, it is a quiet and comfortable. When comparing room rates for my business trip, the Pagoda Hotel was half the price of the hotels along Waikiki beach, an area I wanted to avoid due to traffic.Be prepared when using your GPS to find this hotel, Google Maps will send you to their shared parking structure with Ross Dress for Less. You will need to park in the Ross parking structure from the fourth floor and above. The first three floors are reserved for the Ross customers. The Pagoda Hotel is across the street from the parking structure. The Pagoda Hotel will provide you a parking pass for in/out privileges to the Ross parking structure but you will pay a daily rate of $10/day for your stay at the hotel separate from the room rate. The area around the hotel at night is not the greatest. When I was returning from the Ala Moana Shopping Center during the evening, I was asked by several homeless people for money. Unfortunately, they seem to camp themselves on the main routes of foot traffic people must use to get to and from the hotel. Overall, I probably wouldn't return to this hotel again until they complete their renovations. Unless you are under a budget constraint and like me, wanted to stay away from the Waikiki beach area traffic, I would try to find a condo or room elsewhere.","Fremont, California","slbenz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fremont, California</strong>",23,2.0

One issue I have is that the maids don't clean, they basically come in and make the bed and leave when I think they should Hoover and do some cleaning.

However everything from there goes down hill. The rooms are relatively priced however their is fee on top of fee for every standard hotel amenity. It is $10 a night for them to clean your room, which is minimal, new towels only if they are on the floor in the bathroom if they are anywhere else they stay where they are, remake the bed with the same sheets, the entire 9 days we were had the same sheets on the bed, as well as change the trash but once again they only took out what was directly in the garage can. On top of that the house keeping walked in without knocking twice while we were in our room, one time I was in my bra and she just continued to clean giving me no privacy. The other fee I found ridiculous was another $10 parking fee to park in the parking garage however you had to park on the fourth level or higher which made this convenience into a pain in the butt.Nose was another huge problem I had with this hotel. The doors needed force to close them therefore every time someone closed a door on the floor you could hear and feel it in your own room. As well as every morning around 6 am there would be loud banging from the dumpsters being empty in the food court across the street. This went on for at least an hour, there were only two dumpsters so I don't know what they were doing but I was up by 6:30am every morning due to them, which was a huge bummer for being on a leisure vacation. My final complaint was the fact that the vents in the bathroom were connect to the room to your right. This was a problem because the people in the room next to us would smoke in their bathroom and it would fill out bathroom and room if the door wasn't shut with the smell of smoke. On top of this, the hotel in none smoking all over.This hotel overall is out dated however that can easily be over looked if the service and standards were their as well as wifi in the rooms, all they have is a Ethernet cable which is not compatible with tablets which is what I travel with.

When I checked in, Bill, the front desk attendant started to check me in with no problem. When my partner approached, after the room had been paid for, Bill's attitude switched once he found out I was openly gay. He then started to have an attitude problem with me and my partner by interrogating my partner to the point my partner felt discriminated, fustrated and unwelcome. My partner told me to forget about this hotel and demanded I get a refund. I did get a refund, then we proceded to a near by hotel called The Ala Moana Hotel, rates were slightly higher. However, we did not feel discriminated, Unwelcomed and disrespected because of our sexual orientation. We had a amazing time at The Ala Moana Hotel. The reason I felt the need to write a review was because the following: a.) I phoned the Hotel Manager, Paul Dunn and left several messages at his office as well as his cell phone 2.) Four days after the incident and no call back showed me that this hotel displayed no respect for their guests and any concerns. So due to lack of management I felt this review was important for me to convey to the public. If you are openly gay DO NOT stay here as Bill will disrespect you beyond belief.",,T759657,2,1.0

This is the first time I've ever seen a hotel photo not match up with the actual hotel. I stayed in the tower of the lower part of the hotel, so it was cheaper and also much creepier.The bad:The noise was awful. People were slamming their doors or making other noise all through the night. The room had louver windows, which I will never understand the purpose of in a hotel. They let in all the street noise, which went on at all times of the day. I recommend bringing ear plugs and turning on the air conditioning to drown out the noise at night. The room was dirty. There was mold growing in the air conditioner and mold growing in the vent in the bathroom. I brought cleaning wipes with me, so I got rid of some of the mold in the aircon before I turned it on. The door has one lock. I'm used to double-locks, so this made me pretty uncomfortable.The curtains are thin, so there's no blocking the light to not be woken up early in the morning.The okay things about it: If you need something super cheap and aren't staying too long, I might recommend this place. Otherwise, spend the extra money to get the vacation you want. The staff is pretty nice. I didn't have any trouble with them.It's nice that it's close to Ala Moana Center, Wal-mart, and other shopping. I thought with such a great location, this hotel would be better.

The shopping at this mall is really upscale, all the really big designer names are there. Surprisingly, just outside the mall is a 24 hour Wal Mart and next to that is Starbucks. The Ala Moana beach is not a good choice, there are a lot of homeless sleeping everywhere.  From the hotel it is about a three mile hike into the main strip of Waikiki beach shopping and hot beach spots (tourist heaven).There is a $10 per vehicle, per day parking fee. Wifi is a charge of $10 a day and only accessible in the main lobby. The swimming pool is as big as a oversized jacuzzi. Sleep in Tower 2 is difficult at best. It is currently being renovated for sale as low income housing. Construction is all day long, work and noise. At night people walking on the block can be heard as though they are the room with you (the walls are that thin).

Many locals from other islands book their stay on Oahu at the Pagoda because they give a 'Kama'aina (local) rate' if you have a Hawaii drivers' license. Even without the local connection, you can usually get a very good rate for a very basic room at the Pagoda, and you can get a room on short notice!The hotel isn't located on the beach or in Waikiki, but pretty centrally in Honolulu, within reasonable walking distance of Ala Moana Shopping Mall, lots of restaurants of all types and local bus service.If you want to sample traditional Hawaiian food, the Pagoda Restaurant is a good choice, especially for breakfast - all the eggs, bacon, Portuguese sausage, white rice and sides you'd ever want, plus local juices and teas.If you are on a budget and need a room for just a few nights while awaiting your flight to another one of the Hawaiian Islands, I highly recommend checking out the Pagoda. A basic room has full bathroom, AC, TV, queen or 2 double beds, maybe a small fridge and microwave, maybe a cooktop and some cabinets to store some snacks and food. Wi-fi is optional for a fee or maybe free in the lobby - it was sketchy the last time I stayed. If you want to park there, there is a fee, but considering how much parking is in Honolulu, it's reasonable and safe.

A small ant problem in the kitchenette, but I liked having the kitchenette. If staying in the terrace location, be prepared for the more ghetto side, people walking past your doors late at night with no consideration of others while talking very loudly. Because of the renovation the pool was out of order so you have to walk across the street to the main lobby and use that pool. Don't walk out at night, seems that party goers and crack heads will be all over, possibly walking in and out the hotel possibly from someone they know opening the door for them.

I understand getting what you pay for but I couldn't believe the amount of problems we experienced while staying here. Most of the rooms had cockroaches in them; in ours specifically we not only had them in the bathroom, but also all over the kitchen. There were hundreds of tiny ants covering the kitchenette counter and crawling into the microwave vents. The water for the showers was always fluctuating from scalding to freezing and some of our rooms wouldn't have sufficient pressure coming from the shower heads in order to properly rinse out your hair. Room service would sometimes skip over our room unless we called around 5pm to ask for our towels to be replaced. Room service and security do not knock prior to entering, they simply use their keys and enter the room. The Pagoda is currently undergoing some construction as they plan to turn their towers into condominiums. A letter was left in each of our rooms stating that investors would be stopping by to view the rooms with a security guard for a week long period, during hours that covered the majority of the day, and that our consent was implied, not requested. I find it very unprofessional that they did this, and couldn't offer a scheduled date and time that a room was empty for someone to come and view it, or even talk to the people who were in that room to schedule an appropriate time. There were a few people from our group who actually had security come into their room unannounced (not even knocking) and wake up someone who was taking a nap because they wanted to show that unit. I couldn't believe the audacity of someone to barge in like that and invade someone's privacy.On top of all of this, whenever we would call down and ask for something from the front desk (ex. an extra pot or a bottle opener) we would sit and wait for about 30 minutes and would have to call back again to ask for things. I'm not sure if they hoped we would forget or they were legitimately always busy, but when we called back to ask they would have someone come up within 5 minutes. Sometimes the service at the front desk wasn't even close to personable, as you would be continuously be interrupted by someone starting to do another task. Needless to say I would NOT recommend the Pagoda to anyone, and I hope that what we experienced was simply bad service due to their attempt of overhauling the building.","Kingston, Canada","756natalier</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kingston, Canada</strong>",10,2.0

The only negatives were minor cosmetic issues on shower/tub tiles (beige paint covering peeling off in places where it covered blue tiles underneath), and the basin worn in one lavratory. The main complaint is they charge $1 for local calls and toll free calls...almost no motels'hotels do that. Parking note: It only costs $10 a day to park in Ross garage across the street from Tower (4th through the 6th levels), BUT there are many meters around the perimeter of the hotel that are NOT enforced at night until early morning.

Over the years, I've heard MANY things, as this is where many locals stay while visiting Honolulu. For the most part, many say not to expect a whole lot, simply because it's an affordable place to rest your head. It's all about the location (which, after spending four days here, I will say CANNOT be beat!)You can imagine my concerns when I finally started to look at reviews (especially on TripAdvisor). Roach/ant infestations, horrible service, and old beds. Like many of the previous reviews mention, talking to friends and family about the Pagoda were met with sighs, side glances, and worst of all: silence.I'd heard a few good things about the renovations, and the location. So, rather than running away, I decided to wait and see. I booked a 4 day/3 night stay Tower room, room & car package for about $550-600... not a bad deal, if you ask me.Arriving at the Pagoda Hotel, we were met with a speedy, efficient check-in. I'm glad to say that both of the elevators in the Tower are now working (previous reviews say they were not at the time). Elevators DO require your key card... a good security measure.We drew our breaths as we opened our room door, wondering what we were in for. The rooms are okay. It was very obvious that the room we got was one of the renovated ones, as the walls were newly painted, the carpet seemed new, the bathroom was clean. I checked the beds and they felt brand-new/fresh. I wouldn't say the room was pristine-- you could tell that the wall paint was a layer over what was there before-- but the room was clean, and actually felt pretty comfortable. Very doable, and acceptable.A couple of weird things. We had a room with two double-sized beds. Next to one of them was a wall-sized mirror with a shelf and a sink. A sink next to a bed...? I can't imagine what kind of scenario they were thinking about when they were laying out the room. Yes, it's weird, but I will admit to using it once or twice. An odd convenience! lolSecond, the AC unit, while new, emitted a weird ""milky"" smell. We observed that the smell only came out when it reached the set temperature and switched from AC to Fan mode. After catching a whiff of it the 3rd time we entered the room, we decided to do something about it. We went to Wal-Mart across the street (did I mention the location rocks???) and picked up one of those Febreeze car air fresheners that attaches to the AC vent. Worked like a charm!As far as ant/roach infestations... they were not existent during our stay, except for 3 tiny ants, which were immediately smooshed and tossed away.The biggest reason I would recommend Pagoda is the location. This is a PRIME spot for anyone who is anticipating a lot of shopping and moving around Honolulu. Ala Moana Shopping Center is 2-3 blocks (5-10 minute walk) away. Around the corner is the Don Quijote (not Quixote) store, where they have a bunch of outdoor eateries, and tons of Asian stuff. Across the street you have Wal-Mart and Sam's Club. I would highly- HIGHLY recommend checking out Likelike Drive-In. They have a good menu, their prices are right, and their service is on it. We ended up eating there more times than any other place during our stay.In the end, I was fairly happy with our stay here. The room, while I can't say it was flawless, was acceptable and comfortable enough. And, I think I forgot to mention the location is awesome.","Los Angeles, California","Jeremy T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",7,3.0

There were pigeons nesting between the window jealousies and the screen, making all kinds of cooing noises all day & night long. Not to mention the problem of diseases and lice from these birds right by the kitchen window. There was a big dark wet stain on the carpeted floor in the main living room area uncleaned, also the smoke detector was hanging off the wall. We made complaints to the front desk, than couple of hours later a repairman came by and said the detector was working...but still hanging off the wall. Then our microwave started smoking, a repairman took the broken old one to the next room and exchanged it out with ours. After complains to the district manager, we received no compensation in any way, no apologies, he told us he tried calling and for us to call back. We did, left a message twice a month after the stay and also emailed him, sent him photos and still didn't get any response to the problems. We gave up phone tagging him and calling or emailing, we ain't getting no where with him. His name was Paul. What a ripoff and bad customer service from Pagoda Hotel. We wish we didn't even come to Honolulu to this place! There were also problems with children going in the elevators all soaking wet from the swimming pool, no noise control from all the loud people that were staying there. People smoking and hanging out by the main gate that leads to Rycroft Street fronting the hotel late at night. We were afraid to go out of our room once it got dark. Children running on all levels playing chase master. Never again!! Beware tourist and kamaaina, better to stay in Waikiki, better hotels there and service!

I asked the bed sheets be changed and got new sheets (I hope), but it has a hole from a cigarette burn - totally tacky. I also got a $20 ticket when I parked the rental in the parking lot behind the check-in counter marked reserved for hotel guests. This was terrible because in the 10 minutes I spent checking in and in the process of getting a parking pass, I got a ticket. The TV also turns off and on randomly after an hour or so, and resets to the main menu screen. I wish I had known what I was getting into. The tub is unacceptable for use with an infant because there is pain chipping off and I have never stayed in a hotel with such conditions. The AC in the bedroom is good, but the AC in the living room is extremely loud to the point where sleeping soundly will not happen.

Even after reading some not so great reviews about this hotel, I decided to give the Pagoda a try after comparing the rates to other hotels and not wanting to be stuck in the middle of Waikiki. I thought that since we would be on vacation and be out and about - we basically needed a clean & safe place to sleep. We arrived late at night and the parking situation was terrible. Front desk staff was not at all friendly as I am accustomed to with most businesses in Hawaii. Each shift had conflicting information about the parking. Although Wal-Mart was close by the immediate area around the Pagoda did not feel safe and there were suspicious individuals loitering in parked vehicles outside the hotel which made me feel like they were in the middle of a drug deal. The rooms were old, smelled funny, and upon our arrival there was a note asking for our cooperation to let workers in our room the following day to ""treat for cockroaches"". When we called housekeeping to inquire what type of treatment and who would be doing it, they informed us that the company contracted would be spraying in the ""corners"" and would be unescorted. We put up the ""do not disturb"" sign because we did not want out personal belongings to be affected. The room door did not have any type of security latch or deadbolt. I ended up having to buy Clorox wipes at Wal-Mart because the toilet did not look clean and even had hair on it. We slept on top of the covers as even the sheets didn't seem clean. We did not feel safe in the room whatsoever. The one good thing was it was quiet and there was no outside noise other than the trash truck which comes way too early. Like other reviews, there was still only one, very small, working elevator so my family decided to use the stairs which smelled of urine and we practically ran down because it too looked like it was out of the scene of some horror movie. We ended up using the elevator for the duration of our stay there but it was always a long wait. The internet and staff will tell you that you need a room key to access the elevator. This is NOT true whatsoever. Anybody can enter the hotel and use the elevator - there are no security measures or swipe machine. My children are so embarrassed to tell people where we stayed for vacation. Lastly, when informing friends or relatives in Hawaii where we would be staying, their initial response was that we should find another hotel!! I have stayed at Ilikai, Hilton, Ihilani, Best Western, Maile Sky Court, Pearl Harbor & Tripler Lodging and a place in Kaneohe so I do have a frame of reference to make comparison.","Agat, Mariana Islands","Jay Q</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Agat, Mariana Islands</strong>",2,1.0

When I checked in at the front desk I was told that even if I use my credit card to pay for our room, that we would have to pay up front for the whole bill. I asked the clerk at the front desk if this is their new policy and she said it was and that at the behest of the management, they would have to enforce it. This is not only asinine it is different from other hotels I have stayed at. During our stay, the elevator on the east side of the building was not working a couple of times. We had to walk all the way to the other side of the building in order to use the other elevator. The room was supposed to have utensils including knives. I called the front desk to ask for knives but we never did get any until we left. The Terrace was full of people who were not only seeming under the influence, they were not necessarily people whom you wanted to invite to your Sunday picnic. The attitude of the people at the front desk especially males need major ""renovation"" just like their hotel. They were rude and uncooperative. This is so different from the usual and ubiquitous Aloha spirit that Hawaii is known for every day. They should not be working at a visitor industry, or they need major, major training in customer services.My overall review of the hotel is that the daily rate is a bit too high for the quality of service they have plus the Terrace side of the hotel is very old and need a major big time renovation.

Checking into the hotel went smoothly until we reached our room, we booked the suite that had a king bed and 2 twin beds. The tower they put us in had chained up gates, the slowest elevators ever, and was very run down. The room that we received was even worst! There was such a big gap under the door that COCKROACHES were getting in. We woke up to find roaches all over our belongings and in our kitchen; sink and counters, and we were on the 2nd level of the tower too! When we went to complain about it and to move we found that those room types were only offered in that tower so we accept a SMALLER room in the main hotel. The biggest issue was that there wasn't enough room to accommodate all guests. Since we paid through a 3rd party they weren't able to financially accommodate our stay but did waive our parking fees; 2 vehicles, which we did appreciate but what we really needed was another room so that we didn't have anyone sleeping on the floors but we had to pay for another room! We didn't come on this vacation to try and cause trouble at the hotel and give a hard time or to get anything for free, this trip had become so uncomfortable for my family and especially my parents. It was very hard coming back to the hotel at the end of the day because we were so unhappy. Even after speaking to manager all they could offer was another room in the same tower that we had bug issues (among other issues), a smaller room in a different tower and to waive our parking fees. Even simple requests such as extra towels were a hassle, it would take over 30 minutes each time we requested for any. Now maybe they're understaffed, but when being told they are on their way I would expect them in the next 5-10 minutes, it was just very inconvenient. It's sad to say but I unfortunately would not stay here again, and the main reason being is that these issues were not simple fixes and they were not handled properly; I work for a hotel and the service that was provided does not compare to the service that COULD have been provided.","Las Vegas, Nevada","Krystle S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",5,1.0

Another complaint I have is that they don't seem to have any ""real"" queen or king size beds. They say there rooms are two queens but the are more like double bed sizes. Also, in two different rooms, both tv's had trouble with the on/off switch on the remote. They have two elevators but both visits only one elevator was working.

But maintenance is an issue. Grounds are full of litter. I watched a staff member clean the parking lot. He sure missed a lot of stuff lol. Some facts;One elevator is out if order. Long term guests (I think they live here sinc they say both elevators were out for a week or so and they had to use stairs) (this is a high rise with I think 13 floors). It is a pain waiting on one elevator when all the rooms are sold out. They are packed. Spider webs on light fixtures. With spiders attached. Pool is not heated, about the size of two very large spas. Parking very limited and $10 per night. Our room is strange, it has a sink next to the bed. Trashe scattered in employee only areas. No pride of ownernership. WiFi in lobby $10 per night (I think). I did not try hooking up, just sounded like a problem want to be so I used my phone the entire stay. Good things. Close to Walmart and Starbuck an other shopping. The area is hopping at night. Though I think it also gets working girls if you know what I mean (I observed two very nicely dressed laidies negotiating with two men at 6am going to the Starbucks. When I turned around they were all gone. Only one car in the entire street, lol). Water pressure good, water always hot in shower. Priced for room was good about $100 per night. That is about itOverall I felt safe and had no problems. This is just a place for me to sleep and move on out to other places to enjoy. Will add a few photos to show you my observations.

My only complaint was that they had 2 elevators and one never worked the three days I was there. The other one was working but they decide to work on it one day so at the time there was no elevator service and guests had to walk up and down up to twelve flights of stairs! They are trying to improve as the elevator work they were doing was to upgrade its security features. I would have given them a two-rating, but when I complained to the management I promptly received a response and apology from the manager.

Restaurant: I'm pretty sure they still have the buffet style for dinner so I recommend that because looking around they had lobster which looked delicious. We had the steak which was also very tasty so if you enjoy a meal being brought to you, it's still great here. The waiters are very friendly and joke around which gave off the aloha spirit. There was also two waiters during the breakfast hour that were fantastic at their jobs. They were on top of everything from getting our orders, bringing our food, and asking if anyone needed refills. Room amenities: There's the AC, mini refrigerator, flat screen TV, alarm clock, hair dryer, iron and iron board, telephone, and coffee maker...in the room. Internet access is available with computers and a printer down in the main lobby area you just have to put in a couple dollars/ or use a credit card.

First the good. It is located in walking distance to Ala Moana Shopping Center, major shopping and countless eateries. Also close to big box stores such as Walmart, Ross for Less, etc. Employees are extremely friendly and courteous. The hotel is reasonably priced for Honolulu. Now the downside. Hotel was recently purchased and is undergoing renovation. The rooms are stark, at best, and haven't changed in decades. There was a distinct odor in the hallway, less pronounced in my room. Major negative, due to renovations, there is only one working elevator. Stairs are located at the far end of the hall. It was common for me to wait 10 - 15 minutes for the elevator only to find it jam packed, unless you're using it early morning or late evening. Per the sign posted, the elevator situation will continue for another two months. Thus, I would not even consider staying here until after June 1st.

There's no denying that the establishment shows its age and the rooms are fairly simple. During my stays, I've always found the staff to be friendly and helpful -- in fact they often go out of their way to offer me help before I ask. The location is what keeps me coming back. I don't want to be in Waikiki. I want to be close to shopping and the bus lines to other neighborhoods so I can easily visit my friends. The Pagoda is an easy walk to Ala Moana Shopping Center, Ross, etc. There are also a number of eateries around besides the ones you'll find at the mall. Between the bus stops at the mall and those you'll find on other streets nearby, it's quite easy to get around.However, depending on where you stay, you do tend to get noise from outside. Between the Terrace and the Tower, I found the Tower to be a bit better in this regard. I got some noise from the pool area, but at least that closes at a reasonable hour. When I was in the Terrace, the noise from the parking lot never seemed to stop. It wasn't so much the loudness as it was the constant nature of it -- hard to sleep when someone is always outside talking.The rooms I've had were a good size and comfortable. I've never tried the Internet there and have no intention of doing so at the rate they charge. No in room safe, which is a bit of a negative to me. The beds were fine. The bathroom has both a tub and shower. Good pressure in the pipes, plenty of hot water. The air conditioner can be loud but at least that helps drown out the sound of voices from below.If you're looking for an affordable place outside of Waikiki, this isn't a bad bet. However, first time visitors to Hawaii might find this a bit of a letdown if they're looking for something more than a clean secure place to rest.","Honolulu, Hawaii","LM606</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",163,3.0

When booking the hotel we thought that we did not need a nice place, all we need is a place to sleep, and shower, after all we would be out and about all the time so wasting money on a nicer hotel seemed ridiculous. Plus the pictures made it seem like a rather nice place. Boy where we ever wrong, this is just horrible. You cannot imagine how bad this hotel is! Every morning, yes EVERY morning even Sunday, garbage trucks made very loud banging sounds while picking up the large medal garbage containers on the street. This happened from 2:30am - around 6:00am, our guys usually sleep like rocks but even they woke up. We traveled with a young couple and their baby could not sleep at all, so they transferred to the Aston on the beach in Waikiki and paid $300 more, I wish we would have done the same. Rooms, filthy, stinky, moldy, beds uncomfortable, the halls are not even painted, cracks at the seams in the drywall, my garage has a better interior. The AC units have large gaps around as they are the ""in window"" type, ours almost fell out. The window opened and closed like a shutter blind which let in a-lot of sound at night as previously mentioned. Bathrooms are dirty, tile was cracked and peeling off, the bathroom doors had gaps in them which you could clearly see into the bathroom if someone opened the door to the hall. Also when we where the they were doing renovations and starting at 7:00am they were drilling and hammering outside and it sounded like it was in your room! Pool was also closed.This hotel also is NOT structurally sound! Call me insane but when I placed my coffee on the table it was not level, so out of curiosity I went into the WalMart next door, purchased a small level and to my surprise parts of the floor where almost 3/8"" off level, the walls and ceiling are also not level. I don't know who their inspector , but here in Cali those structural problems would have them shut down for sure. This hotel is for the ""hourly"" people only, this is not a Hotel to say with a couple or family.The Pagoda Restaurant has bad food too, at high prices, not nearly as horrible as the hotel but we went in for breakfast it tasted stale and wasn't fresh, even our toast tasted off :/ There is a McDonald's & Denny's in walking distance if you want a better breakfast. In conclusion, I would say cancel your Beach-side Steakhouse reservations and pay the few hundred dollars more for a nicer place. You can actually get a nicer hotel for a mere $30 more than this. Just stay away.","Sacramento, California","ArtStayedHere</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, California</strong>",5,1.0

We planned to come to Oahu in January/Feb. 2013 for the Chinese New Year but the rates are now $139-159/night. Typically, they average $79/night or less. Who can afford these new rates? The Pagoda Hotel has traditionally been a hotel that caters to the local community, including people that live in Hawaii and those that were born there and return to visit. Now, the Pagoda is charging exhorbitant prices like Waikiki! It's a 2-star hotel, not an exquisite 5-star hotel. Improvements have been made, but they're not of the magnitude which would justify these new prices. We like the hotel and have stayed there many times before, but we may actually cancel our trip to Hawaii because of this. Wake up, management.

It still had that well lived in looked that was both welcoming, but not fancy. The only problem was that during my five day stay, only one elevator was working.

Flat out it is just very old. The halls are dingy and smell of old folks home.Our towels had stains and so did the bottom mattresses. There was cockroach poop on the table in our room. It is incredibly noisy as the windows don't close all the way and the bed feels like a table top so don't expect any restful sleep. We had requested a queen bed but were given a room with doubles so we had to squish quite uncomfortably on a tiny bed. They were not able to accommodate us except for switching to an only smoking floor which was not an option as I am allergic to cigarette smoke. The shower temperature never stayed consistent and sometimes only half the water came out of the shower head, so you were partially taking a bath as well. Parking is across the street at the Ross for only $10 a day but you can only park starting on level 4. This would be reasonable if the elevator worked but it did not, so we had to walk up and down 4 to 6 flights of stairs multiple times a day.

We called police, who were great, but the management more or less ignored the problem, despite the fact that it was a registered guest who stole. No security in lobby, nor any ID checks of registered guests. This guest was registered under a false name by the front desk.

I have friends who like it, and many people I know have stayed in the past. I didn't know it was a 2 star until after we left and I was asked to review it for another travel site. If it's a 2, it's a pretty good 2. We planned to stay at a resort for 3 nights of our trip, so I was looking for somewhere less expensive for our 2 nights in Honolulu. Pagoda's good points: clean enough. Very friendly and helpful staff, especially Jasmine who remembered my name twice. Pool was small, but nice and clean. Beautiful gardens, pond and waterfall at the restaurant next door. Convenient location to Ala Moana mall, walking distance to the beach, restaurants nearby. We ate at LikeLike driven across the street, were able to take a quick bus to Waikiki Beach, very easy. It was good central location without having to stay in the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. Parking, although across the street, was only $10 per day compared to $20-$30 in Waikiki. Appreciated the ice water in the lobby. Happy to have a fridge and microwave. The negative: a few minor things, I don't mind outdated decor and furnishings as long as it's clean enough. While the room was pretty clean, the carpet felt grubby and felt the need to wear socks in the room. There was kind of a musty smell, not a horrible odor, probably from the old school window ac, which was loud. When we got there the room wasn't ready, and the front desk although very pleasant was short staffed and the wait to check in took way too long. One of the elevators was out for a day and a half of our 2 day stay, so sometimes the wait was longer. Overall, I would stay there again. if you're looking for a 4 star hotel and luxury accommodations, this isn't going to be for you. But if you plan to spend your time on the beach, exploring the island and visiting all the wonderful foodie places nearby and you want a less expensive and convenient location, I recommend the Pagoda Hotel.",,Kuidaosumi,11,4.0

The windows didn't close very well and we were able to see the ground through the closed windows. The good: We had a window air conditioner that worked well. The bad: We had to run it almost 24 hours a day. The good: The parking lot was a blessing. Two other couples in our group overlooked the pool and there were noisy groups there until very late. We had a small fridge, microwave, coffee maker (bring your own coffee and filters) and stove. Decor was really outdated but functional and clean. The locationThe bad: It was a 15 minute walk to the beach. The good: I've stayed in Waikiki for every other visit and I much preferred this Honolulu location. There was a mix of residents and tourists so it felt much more friendly and A LOT more reasonable for meals. There is a Walmart and Sam's Club at the end of the block and a really unique market named Don Quijote that was an experience! You can buy motor oil, steaks, a comforter and bananas all in one store. I'd opt for Don Quijote because the prices are the same and it is such a wacky place. There is a great coffee place named Poppy's that we visited regularly. A very friendly place. There are lots of Pho places close by but my husband is not a fan so I wasn't able to try any. Bottom line: The hotel is OK. Lots of families, I felt safe and the staff was friendly. Having said that: The hotel was dated & the AC was loud and endless. For a good price it would be fine. When I return I will probably look for another hotel in the same area.

I was greeted by Daniel and, although the place was buzzing, he made my check-in fast and easy.I was assigned a lower floor room, but-- being a light sleeper-- asked Daniel if it would be at all possible to switch to a higher floor. He searched until he found an available room in the middle of the building. I was really happy, since this meant I'd be able to get some rest before heading out for the night...The room was spacious, but had a slight odor. I turned on the A/C and, after a while, it kind of went away. Needs some work, but it wasn't a big deal. All the basics utilities (e.g. hairdryer & iron) were supplied, which was a plus! I wanted to experience Waikiki, and I knew exactly who to ask: Daniel actually took the time to recommend some places to go, gave me a map and pin-pointed it all!

To start off the reason why i booked at this hotel was because of a family emergency and i was coming in from new york so it was a last minute thing. Pros: in a great location with all types of stores all around like walmart and a huge shopping mall which by the way was the most beautiful mall i have ever been to. Front desk staff were nice. Cons: The hotel needs serious renovation. One of the elevators were out of order the second night which i had to walk down the stairwell from th 5th floor. I had a total of 3 guest in my room and housekeeping would leave 2 bath towels only. I left a note for housekeeping letting them know there were 3 guest but it continued to happen for about 6 nights until i complained to the front desk. If you did not throw ur towels on the floor hosekeeping would not give you new ones. The bed sheet were not changed everyday.  I bought a cup of instant soup in the store at the hotel and i asked for hot water and they looked at me as if i was not speaking english. They sent me to the front desk and the desk sent me to housekeeping, it was a huge run around.

We chkd in on 4/21 for 3 nights in their std room w/2 beds on the 6th flr. The room was very neat & clean with cable TV (not flatscreen), round table w/2 chairs, dresser you can put your luggage on & the 2 beds that were comfortable enough. There is a small sink by one of the beds which is convenient if you need running water. The bathroom was older but it was clean with nice white towels, a shower with good water pressure & a drain that really drains. Isn't it awful when you end up standing in ankle deep water at the end of your shower? But not here! Keep in mind this is not the Ritz Carlton so there was no view, no lanai but that's okay. Every unit has a room airconditioner but didn't use it. The elevator is a little wacky sometimes by not stopping at your floor, but press your floor button again & it will get you there. No big deal. I found the associates at the check-in desk to be professional & helpful when I needed directions. The hotel is within walking of Ala Moana (2 blks), Ala Moana Park (a longer walk crossing a busy street), Don Quijote and the HNL Convention Center. The area of the hotel is considered Koreatown, so there are many Korean restaurants & Korean owned shops. Heard good things about some of the restaurants. Would probably stay here again staying in the main hotel bldg or would try another Aqua location.

We live on the Big Island of Hawaii and was visiting Oahu. We got a good deal through expedia for only $93 a night for a studio with kitchenette. Well we got off on a rocky start, arrived at the hotel after 3 pm which is the check-in time but our room wasn't ready till little before 5 pm. So we killed time by walking to the stores near there, there is a Ross and a Wal-mart (which is very good where you can buy groceries, and close to Ala Moana Mall nearby and checked out the eateries along the way. $10 for parking, maybe we were lucky because we were always able to find parking right near the building. We stayed at the Pagoda Terrace which is across from the street from the main hotel, in a studio because of the kitchenette, our refrigerator was leaking so we called the front desk. They sent someone fast to fix the problem. Overall, the room we were in, looks like they are in the middle of remodeling the room, looks like it was recently painted. The bathroom looks like it was being remodeled. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. Hot water every time you take a bath or wash dishes. We were facing the parking lot, so it does get noisy when you are trying to sleep. Could hear other guests talking, yelling, slamming there car doors, car alarms going off. We told the front desk and they were understanding, they said we could call back when the manager comes back and ask to change room. But we just decided to stay in the room we were given because I think the noise would still be there because there are clubs nearby. The room has a microwave, stove with two burners, toaster, coffee maker, pots, pans, plates, forks, knives, can opener which were all clean, also ironing board and iron. Our room was cleaning on a daily basis the entire time we were there, we would go out for an hour or two and when we got back the room was cleaned, we got fresh towels and our beds were made, thrash taken out. The maids were very nice and friendly. They lock the gate at a certain time and you need your room key to get in the building which is kind of good. The Pagoda Restaurant is great also, we went on a Saturday night so it was Prime Rib, Crab legs, and other seafood and entrees for around $31.00 which is a pretty good price. I had been reading the reviews before I left for Oahu and was kind of nervous of what kind of room I would be getting since some of the reviews I read were bad so I had emailed the hotel several times and made some requests such as requesting a remodeled room and to be by nearby family who was staying at the hotel. I guess they listened to my requests. My family had the two bedroom with kitchenette on the same floor and there room was just as clean and spacious.

This hotel was fairly close to my morning meeting location, and Honolulu morning traffic is as bad as any city in the country, so the location trumped the bad reviews.The building is old and run down, the room furnishings are cheap, the air conditioner was old, loud and smelled of mold, and the room didn't seem to be all that well cleaned. In short, both the hard product (the room furnishings) and the soft product (maintenance and service) were poor. The walls are thin and the room was loud. I woke up at 1:30 am from noise, and again a couple of hours later.There is no internet, and a hefty upcharge for parking. The location has issues as well. It is not close to beaches, and the neighborhood has a significant homelessness/vagrant problem. I'm not blaming the hotel, nor am I insensitive to the homeless problem, but I'd personally rather not stay at a hotel where someone is defecating in the bushes outside.Interestingly, the public areas and lobby are actually kind of nice, which made the room experience extra-disappointing. They have a restaurant I didn't sample and a sundry shop open late. It is a short walk to Ala Moana Center, so if you have a big need to visit a mall, that's convenient.I would not stay at this hotel again even if it were free.","Marina del Rey, California","Fitch7600</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Marina del Rey, California</strong>",52,1.0

Do not go with the expectation of flat screen tv's or the latest furnishings as that is not the market that they serve. The rooms are spacious comfortable and clean While the Hotel could use new carpeting and furniture, such a remodel (esp. in this economy) would likely be reflected in a huge price increase. For now, the rooms are comfortable, clean & affordable. While Pagoda does cater to the local Hawaii population (esp. local folk from the outer island like myself) this hotel could also appeal to the value conscious mainland visitor seeking accomodations comparable to many mainland chains such as Ramada, Motel 6, Super 8 and the like. Their excellent staff are very friendly and helpful. Kudos esp. to Bill at the Front Desk for being patient & understanding with an indecisive guest and for recommending/finding a great room that was a short distance from parking/elevators so that my elderly father didn't have to walk far. I also appreciate the Housekeeping staff who knew immediately about the items I had left in the room at checkout whe I called and who made arrangements to get those items back to me.

We had no problems with bugs the night we were there. The room is not soundproof and we could hear lots of street noise lasting until after midnight. The bed was more comfortable than I was expecting after first seeing the room and despite the noise we managed a good nights sleep.

I'm sure that there was a time when it was quite a substantial property, well liked and respected. I spoke to locals who said that its restaurant was once well-regarded and people came from far around to eat there. Not anymore. I recently stayed at the Pagoda as part of a conference delegation. Locals who I spoke to were shocked that an international delegation would be put there. It's old, tired and in a fairly dodgy area, with seedy s-x shops dotting the neighbourhood and the sort of people hanging around the hotel foyer that you would not want to mix with. It's also a very noisy neighbourhood and sound proofing has not been undertaken in the hotel. The hotel is clean and the staff are alright, but the place is tired and ugly. A full renovation is required, but this may not be possible. A bulldozer might be the only solution. Note, the hotel is also a considerable walk from Waikiki so don't believe promotional material which suggests it is just around the corner. It is quite poorly located.

Over the many years the Pagoda has always been my home away from home whenever visiting Honolulu, my last stay being only two weeks ago. A thirteen-floor tower offers rooms that are large enough to easily accommodate the needs of a traveling couple. Across the street from the tower is a complex of apartment type rooms complete with kitchens and separate bedrooms suitable for traveling families. Additionally, the hotel’s onsite restaurant offers an eclectic selection of food dishes designed to satisfy the palate of any traveler. Alas however with the passing of time coupled with ever changing travelers’ demographics, the Pagoda has sadly long since lost its initial luster. Five decades of wear and tear have taken their toil and now only a major overhaul can restore this venerable establishment to current standards found in more modern-day hotels, of which there are many to choose from in Honolulu. During my most recent visit to the Pagoda, one of the two balky elevators refused to function properly leaving in its wake long standing lines of disgruntled visitors. My room, while certainly clean enough, was as usual compromised with an undersized and noisy air window conditioner. To make matters worse, the one time enormously popular Pagoda Floating Restaurant had radically reduced its hours making dining options very problematic at best. Not even the still wonderful garden ambiance complete with its multi-hued koi fishpond could compensate for me these encountered shortcomings. As it currently stands, if you’re visiting Hawaii seeking a tropical reprise the Pagoda is probably not the hotel for you. One would be well advised to seek something closer to the center of Waikiki, which is another two miles away. Even if you can’t afford an ocean front room and must walk a few blocks to Hawaii’s premier beach, there’s something to be said for the experience of a strolling leisurely past the numerous exotic visitors’ attractions en route to a white sandy beach. However, if you’re simply looking for no frill accommodations for a couple of days and don’t mind mixing in with a sometimes raucous crowd, the Pagoda is as good (or worse) as any other you might find in Honolulu.

This last time was particularly poor, though, as we had to change our room three different times and we never did get a good, quiet room. To the new hotel management: I don't mind the old furniture and old pictures on the wall or the sink/bathroom decour. If you have limited funds to invest please, please consider the following suggestions from someone who has stayed there many times: 1) get new drapes that are thick enough to block the incoming light from outside; 2) get new, soft velour blankets for all the beds; 3) get sheets that are long enough to span the entire length of the bed; 4) place a microwave & fridge in every room. If you want to compare favorably with other hotels in the area, then you should consider offering free Internet service to guests (including password for lobby computer), some token breakfast items, and free newspapers (USA Today & Honolulu Advertisor). And, you shouldn't be charging extra for coffee - that's ridiculous, considering the price of the room! I suffer from migraines and really need to sleep in a dark place.

I looked in need of repair but the layout had potential in a Melrose Place sort of way. There was a small pool area in the center of the 5-story building. We chose this place because the rooms had 4 separate beds + kitchenette and that's exactly what we needed.The room we had was generally clean but when furniture and appliances get older they just get to that point where they look dirty no matter how much you clean them. The rooms were big though. The staff was also very nice but the five minutes you spend interacting with staff really don't make up for the biggest issue - NOISE.It seems as though many of the people -- families in particular -- who were staying there that week didn't understand that the HALLWAYS ARE NOT PART OF THEIR ROOMS. We heard kids and adults talking, yelling, running around the halls at all times of day and night. 12 noon, maybe it's okay. But at 3 or 4 AM? COME ON. And playing guitar and singing??? There's only so much asking you can do for people to be quiet without starting to feel that it's futile. It also seemed like there was a kids' pool party going on every day. I really don't know where all the kids came from.We saw the door for the Security Office downstairs but never happened to see a security guard. I think this noise problem could be solved if they actually had someone who just strolled about the halls every hour or so and told people to go into their rooms and close their doors if they were being noisy, but also after 10 at night -- no matter what. Seriously people, go in your room and shut your door! Another noise-related issues was the doors -- both the knocking and the constant slamming. It seemed like everyone but us on our floor knew each other. Kocking -- slamming -- knocking - slamming. Again at all times of the day. Our room was also unfortunately near the stairwell whose door squeaked and slammed all the time. If they would get someone to WD-40 the doors and maybe adjust the door closers so they didn't slam shut then maybe they'd be able to fix this issue as well.Needless to say we bought earplugs as soon as we could but it should not be that way.Oh, and the water hammer in that building was by far the worst I've ever heard. Every time someone would use a sink in our unit or above or below or next door you could hear the pipes hammering at you when the water got shut off. I swear to God we could have all gotten drunk playing a drinking game based on the water hammer noises.Lastly, the elevators, particularly the one nearest our room smelled AWFUL. It was like the combination of a bunch of strong chemicals and you seriously lost your appetite if you didn't hold your breath. I really don't understand putting carpeting in there. Why not a tile or pergo floor or something that could be easily cleaned that would NOT soak up whatever stench happens upon it?Anyhow, I heard that the hotel was recently under new ownership so I hope the new owners do something about this -- in which case my review would be null and void. But as of Jan 2011 the above seems to be the case.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin","frequenttraveler222</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milwaukee, Wisconsin</strong>",2,2.0

This place didn't even look like a hotel, it look like an apartment complex where people lived. The folks next to us must have had 20 people crammed into the room. All 3 rooms that we rented were equally bad. We had to crank up the A/C just to mask the awful smell. The carpet looked like it had not been changed in 50 years. The beds, I think they picked up from a city dump. They were so bad that sleeping on the floor probably would have been better. The sheets were so thin that if you pulled on them it probably would have ripped. The bathroom had broken tile, and the showers were probably original from the 1940's.

This review, however, is based on a stay this year!The hotel is in Honolulu proper, a few blocks from the Ala Moana Shopping Center, but is not next to Waikiki -- one reason it seldom gets mentioned. For frequent visitors who don't need the full resort experience, though, it is more than adequate. The price, at least when booked through their web site, is excellent, and parking is plentiful (there's a charge, but a lot less than most other properties).There are two separate buildings -- the tower and the terrace. The terrace is actually across the street from the tower, which is connected to the check-in desk and the restaurant. I stayed in the tower, and found my room to be more than adequately large. I was impressed that there was a sink separate from the bathroom, which also had a sink, facilitating matters for those sharing the room with others. There were also a refrigerator, a microwave oven, and a safe -- all handy to have! Incidentally, each building has its own swimming pool, so no inconvenience there.Desk staff were friendly and efficient, as was the woman tending the shopette. I can't say that I had any interaction with other hotel staff.Shopette prices, by the way, are more than reasonable, quite a difference from even the mid-range properties in the US.The restaurant is renowned for its koi pond, for good reason. The pond surrounds the entire restaurant, and there are lots of tables at the windows and on a small lanai that allow views of the fish (or you can see them from the walkways outside). Feeding is scheduled for several times daily.For the daily breakfast buffet, the food is good but not spectacular. For the price, though, I'm not complaining. Sunday brunch (served after breakfast) and nightly dinner are also buffets, but I didn't partake this time. Hint: be sure to have reservations for dinner; I didn't eat dinner there because I didn't have a reservation and didn't want to wait 2 hours!I had a couple minor quibbles with the room. First, the plumbing in the tub could have been secured a bit better. I tried to adjust the shower head, and the cap hiding the hole in the wall slid all the way down the pipe.More important -- to me, anyway -- was the inefficiency of the air conditioning in the room. I realize I'm visiting the tropics, but when A/C is provided I do like it to work. It was provided by a window-mounted unit, which had a huge gap between the unit and the wall beneath it. Fortunately, I didn't notice any critters coming in, but there was a lot of gunk in there that should have been cleaned out. Also, the unit wasn't large enough to do its job. The temperature in the room was actually quite comfortable, but I was trying to lower the humidity a bit. I ran the air conditioning on high cool, full cold temperature for 48 hours and it was finally starting to make a difference when I checked out.The only other advice I would provide is that while the hotel's address is on Rycroft Street, and the main entrance (a breezeway, not a door) is indeed there, the parking is behind the property on Kanunu Street. There is a small parking lot, while validated parking is available in the Ross Dress for Less garage across the street (levels 4 through 7 for hotel guests). Since two school buses were taking up the entire space in front of the hotel entrance, I ended up feeding a meter and walking back to the hotel because there was no advance indication of where to park.To sum up, I recommend this hotel for those who don't need a resort experience, don't need to be right on the beach, and don't need a lot of fancy amenities. If you just want to be pampered, you're better off elsewhere, but for those of us with more pedestrian tastes the Pagoda is quite suitable.","Federal Way, Washington","FlyerDave</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Federal Way, Washington</strong>",4,3.0

Location and price is their foremost concern which are the true advantages to this hotel. Location is good for those who like being conveniently located in the midst of Honolulu but without the excess press of people (and cars) that characterize Waikiki. The hotel is very near a Walmart and Ala Moana Mall and, if you didn't know, has its own well known restaurant downstairs. A decent diner is also located in the retail complex next door and a sprinkling of other restaurants abound in the area (mostly ethnic). Price is reasonable for a hotel in Honolulu. What you should keep in mind is that Hawaii's largest industry is tourism so a lot of hotels have been around for a long time. This makes the average hotel in Hawaii fairly aged, unless or despite renovations. So you're not being cheated for what you get; that's just how it is in Honolulu.I've stayed with my parents a number of times at the Pagoda. Each time, we get a moderate room in the hotel tower. Usually we get one fairly high up, because you do have some street noise (not like Waikiki but sometimes loud cars or teens, etc). Parking for the hotel tower (the one without the kitchenettes) is usually in the small restaurant/hotel parking lot below or across the street in the upper levels of the parking garage. You do pay for the parking; the front desk gives you a pass that you put on your dash. Rooms are nothing special, definitely dated but clean. We've stayed there at least 8 times over as many years and nothing we've seen has been revolting. The hotel tower usually have a small fridge, microwave, and coffee maker which is what my parents really appreciate. The pool at the hotel tower (I understand there's another one for the terrace) never seems to have a lot of people in it (usually one family at a time) but was definitely small. If you're unlucky I'd say 6 to 8 guests would stuff it to the gills. We've never had a problem with the hotel staff, but we don't usually ask for much besides a lot of extra towels, which the cleaning ladies usually give us immediately.This isn't a place to get excited about, especially if you're making a special trip to Hawaii for that much anticipated family vacation. It isn't in the bustle of excitement that makes Waikiki and isn't very near any beaches. What it is is a decent affordable hotel to rest and sleep before going back out into the tropical sunshine.",California,"rea3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",3,4.0

The location is fine if you are willing to take The Bus to get around; it's a 5 minute walk to the nearest ""The Bus"" stop; and it's about a 30 minute walk to Waikiki Beach, slightly less to Ala Moana Beach Park. There is a parking fee if you have a car. The kitchen is great to have if you have a family and want to save some money on meals. That said, there were some problems, although they were not serious. The worst was the nightly noise level from the street outside (we stayed in the building called the Pagoda Terrace; it's possible other buildings are quieter). The A/C drowned some of the noise but not enough for restful sleep. The kitchen was minimally equipped...two pots, dishes and flatware for 4, one sharp knife, one cutting board, one small two burner stove, coffeemaker (and coffee), fridge, microwave; but plenty of small ""sugar ants"" to get into any food left on the counter. The unit was older and somewhat worn, but otherwise clean. However the front desk person was very brusque upon check in., enough that I would try to stay elsewhere next time. MAKE SURE you have the EXACT SAME credit card you used to make the reservation and first night's deposit, as they will not allow you to use a different card to pay for the rest of your visit. This policy is to prevent ID theft, but the logic escaped me as we had ample photo ID to prove who we were and the reservations were made in our names! (We wound up paying with traveller's checks and having the original deposit credited back to our card). There was a nearby WiFi network we could access but it was not the hotel's network, and it was not always on. There are two small pools but the one at our building was full of small children whenever it was open.

Conveniently located close to Waikiki (within 6 blocks), Ala Moana Shopping Center, Walmart and several ""local"" style restaurants. I like the location because its fairly centrally located, if Waikiki is not your only destinaton. Our room was in the Terrace across the street from the main lobby. The rooms were clean, but definitely shabby (cracked plaster, stained tub, chipped sink, ""tired""/dated paint job). This place has definitely seen better days. It looks to be stuck in the late 60s/early 1970s era. The room had a coffeemaker, small refrigerator, microwave, sink and some kitchen utensils. Small bathroom and water temperature changes when someone on another floor flushes or uses the sinks. Small air conditioning unit, but it worked OK. Not great lighting, but better than some I've seen. Closet space was good and there is an in-room safe. Parking is included and there were adequate, but small spaces; additional parking is available in the Ross parking structure one block over. Maid service was inconsistent - one day our kitchen towels weren't touched and no new towels were put out; another day, everything was replenished incuding extra soaps, towels, etc. Staff were generally friendly; some of the other guests were more somber and standoff-ish.They have 2 pools, a gift shop, a beauty shop and travel/tour agency on site. The buffet restaurant across the street was nice and reasonable considering the offerings (with a Japanese/""local"" slant). The restaurant has a massive fish pond filled with koi and nightly feedings are an event. Any phone messages to your room are taken by and then relayed to you by a live person, not a voicemail service. There was some noise from gardeners and other guests using the pool, but after 9pm it generally was quiet. Access to the terrace after hours is by keycard only.Pagoda seems to be a favorite for expatriates returning to Hawaii and low budget customers. It is generally cheaper than Waikiki hotels, but you do get what you pay for. I wouldn't stay here if you want any amenities or to impress anyone.

The rooms are mostly clean, but not to mainland standards. The locals swear by this place, at least my wife does. Everyone I met there, both staff and guest were more open and down to earth than the other big hotels on the strip. I go to Hawaii to relax and enjoy life as the Hawaiians do. Having fun can sometimes be a little noisy. The Pagoda has a very good security force who are also very low key. I have always felt safe. Use common sense about your valuables. The food is fantastic, especially the dinner buffet. I will stay there again. Locals from the outer islands are the bread and butter for this property. Enjoy the chance to see real Hawaii.

To make things worse, you can not open any of the windows. The walls were bare, painted cream which made the room very dark- even with all the lights on. It did not look like any of the pictures that they advertised. The paint in the bedroom was peeling. The bathroom smelled and the bedsheets were soiled. The noise outside the hall was unbearable. We were scared to even go to sleep. We had no choice but stay that one night and were very lucky to find accommodations somewhere else. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Please give this hotel an extreme makeover.","Hercules, CA","Inspiration24843</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hercules, CA</strong>",1,1.0

I would definentley avoid staying there again. The room was very dusty and there were people who lived there long term ( it seemed like) hanging outside our room and in the halls at all hours of the night and day. In the middle of the 2nd night I heard someone in the hall screaming and arguing with someone for about an hour straight!

The rates are reasonable, and the rooms have been upgraded, to include a microwave and small refrigerator. It's a great hotel for people who don't want to be in the tourist ghetto of Waikiki; the restaurant (especially the buffet) and lounge are popular with locals. The staff is friendly, if not always efficient. I have friends from the mainland who won't stay any place BUT the Pagoda. They don't want to be in the tourist ghetto of Waikiki, and love the 24-hour Korean restaurant just across the street.",,ariana,46,3.0

Yes if you stay at the hotel side it is much better then the other side across the street. People do live on the other side because it's cheaper than renting a house in Hawaii. The staff is friendly. If I felt it was not a good or safe placce to stay I would not be staying their again for a 3 time. It's a popular place with the locals.

I had read the reviews and thought it couldnt be that bad, but i was wrong. The hotel smelled so disgusting. People lived there and were always in the hallways hanging around our room. the staff was very friendly. The rooms were clean but nothing special. Elevators are slow. While we were there all of our friends including us had got the flu not sure if it was from the hotel....and in our friends room they had found drug parafinalia in the closet. Finally we changed hotels, The Waikiki Terrace. This hotel was great. same price and it is right on the waikiki strip. I would not recomend the pagoda. I hope if you do stay there you will have a better experience.","maui, hawaii","Kikihawaii</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>maui, hawaii</strong>",5,1.0

Was told that they would let us know if one was available later. The next day, around 2pm, I asked if there was a non-smoking; was told that I should have asked before noon. I was later shown a non-smoking room, which was worse than the smoking room we were in. The rooms, including the one we stayed in, were damp, moldy and stuffy. The room was probably vacuumed, but looked like it hadn't had any deep cleaning for decades; layers of dirt on the windows and air-conditioner; carpet pulling up and wrinkled; no vent in the bathroom, which made it even stuffier. The hotel looks like it hasn't been renovated since the 70's, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but coupled with the uncleanliness, and damp stuffiness, it is bad. Except for the room snafu, the staff was OK to indifferent. I would not stay there again. I've stayed in several Waikiki hotels and would take the bother of the traffic there before I go back to the Pagoda.","Ventura, CA","Jet22452</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ventura, CA</strong>",2,1.0

I had to drive around the block 4 times, then stop to ask for help before finding the entrance on Rycroft. The staff there were terrific; at my request, even sent me (COD) several items I'd left behind. The room was clean and large, with a full kitchen. The value was terrific. The elevator and hallways were dirty. There were lots of people hanging around, apparantly long-term foreign (?) residents staying in Honolulu for medical treatment. The restaurant was delightful in its setting above an extensive koi pond. A car was essential to get around and to the beaches, since the Pagoda is off the beaten path. But it is very close to the Ala Moano Shopping Center and convenient to Ward Center. A stay at the Pagoda is a great place to get a more Hawaiian experience (rather than staying on Waikiki with all the other mainlanders).","St. Louis, MO","Kathleen M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Louis, MO</strong>",10,3.0
