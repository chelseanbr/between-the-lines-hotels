I was told booking the hotel was a big mistake. However, my experience contradicted that advice; the stay was great! Clean room, friendly and accommodating staff, and an excellent location. I would definitely stay there again. That’s the Pro’s. The Con’s? The hotel charged me above and beyond my $160.68 “Resort Fee” an additional $71.00. Here is the crazy part. That charge appeared AFTER I checked out! I called to complain. The only rather unpleasant person on their staff (because he insisted on rudely interrupting me) said, “Oh give it 24 hours and it will fall off your account. We do that all the time.” My problem? That you do it all the time doesn’t make it right. The person said it was for incidentals. What incidentals are there after I’ve checked out? In my opinion they do this to ride the customer’s money for a few days. The hotel was great but there are no incidentals. They have no room service, no amenities (In fact their vending machine had only two choices: Coke and waters and you have to pay at the machine. In conclusion, it was a very pleasant stay. I would stay there again, but to charge an additional $71 dollars on top of the city wide ripoff practice of charging “resort fees” that supposedly are to cover those services was the one thing that tainted the experience.",,66cliffordf,0,4.0

Hopefully no one has the same problems I did, it was just bad timing and a bad room. On the first night a hotel staff came up to our room asking if we had just showered, and we had, he said the room below us was leaking. A couple hours later of the staff not showing back up, I went to the front desk and asked if I could take a shower because of the leak, they said we could but that the leak was essentially our fault, that we had overflown the bathtub and got water all over the floor, we had not done that, there was almost no water on the floor. I told him that was not the case and he proceeded to argue with me telling me I was wrong and there HAD to be water ALL over the floor. I told him that I just wanted to shower and if it did leak again, I don't want to have to pay for damages or anything. He said ""well i don't know what to tell you about that"". At the check in I was told I was paying a $90 security deposit, and I have not gotten that back. I left my room in good condition so I don't know why I haven't gotten that. Apart from my bad experience, the other staff was friendly, and the place was pretty clean, you get what you pay for, the rooms are very small. ",,lenanyilas,0,3.0

We had already stayed there several times. We liked the excellent location of the hotel, as well as the good treatment by the staff, all very friendly and attentive. However, the last time, we noticed the presence, among the employees, of a tall, thin man who wore a turban. He seemed to be a type of manager.Such an individual never spoke to us, and he seemed to try to avoid any contact with us, as he always left the room when we approached. Such a situation was very uncomfortable. The breakfast, which according to the hotel, is a courtesy, has dropped in quality. The hotel, in addition to its name, also needs to change its furniture, which is very old and old-fashioned (the ironing board was broken ).

I'm sure others have better experiences.The Good - Times Square Location: Usually we stay at the Crown Plaza two blocks away, which is also next to Times Square, but the cost was less at the Broadway @ Times Square (the name when we booked in February), Casa Tui (name last week when we visited) or NYCASA46 Hotel (name I found on TripAdvisor today in order to post my review).The Bad - Billing: Wow. So many people in the lobby having trouble with their bills. Lots of raised voices. Primary issue is that if you booked months ago under the Broadway @ Times Sq name there wasn't a facilities fee (or it was lower than the new owners' current facility fee) and the staff had to manually match your copy of the booking invoice to their computer screen pricing. If you didn't have your original booking notice it was a mess. Thankfully we prepaid in full with the actual hotel last February and had that email confirmation and they had to match it. They took a copy of the email and asked us to come back in an hour while they manually adjusted their computer system to honor it. Also those that booked through a third party (like Booking.com) had issues with the pricing of the fees as well. So... watch your invoice if booked before ownership change.The Bad - Comp Breakfast: I had thought this would save us some money, however, the food was so pitiful that we ended up eating out after that first breakfast. Unripe bananas, Trix flavored yogurt (strawberry and VERY sweet), stack of frozen Eggo waffles, hard boiled eggs in a crockpot, dry pastries... The Bad - Size of Room: I mean very tiny. We were on the 9th floor (top). There are 10 rooms per floor with one permanent resident (sweet old man we met in the lobby). Anyhow, the bathroom counter was only 11"" x 25"" with a corner shower of 33"" x33"". The 31"" television is on the SIDE of the queen sized bed so the two guests can't sit and watch the television without sitting on the side-edge of the bed. We didn't watch the tv, but placement was awkward. Clock in the room had USB outlets for charging your phone bedside (great) but the time not the clock was wrong by over an hour and there was no button to adjust the time. No, it did not synch with your phone to the correct time when you were charging either. Bed was comfortable though.The Musty - AC: Beyond the tiny size, the very musty smell of the AC was barely livable. We tried spraying Fabreze but the AC/heating units need DEEP cleaning. Next time we are going back to Crown Plaza or trying another Times Square hotel.","Seattle, Washington","LiveAGr8Story</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",211,2.0

On the day we checked out, we learned that the hotel had been sold and renamed Casa Tua Hotel. I can tell you that the former owners provided an outstanding breakfast (bagels, cereal, hard-boiled eggs, donuts & sweet breads, pre-made waffles, bananas/apples, yogurt, orange juice, tea, and coffee from 6 am-10 am. There was an room with more than adequate seating and an attendant made sure the food did not run out. Our room had a comfortable queen-sized bed (I have back problems so I have to have a good mattress). There was a dresser and plenty of room for our bags. The air conditioner was strong and reliable. There was a safe for valuables and a full-size iron & ironing board. The bathroom was roomy and had a good-sized shower (no bathtub). There was a hairdryer. The shower gel, shampoo, and body lotion were dispensed from wall and shower receptacles so bring your own bar soap, shower puff, etc. if you’re particular. We were in Room 905 on the ninth floor and hear absolutely no noise from the street. The location of this hotel cannot be bearer if you want just a short walk home from all the theaters and the discount TKTS booth is a short walk away. The employees were very friendly, especially the doorman, who allowed us to store our luggage for a few hours between our noon checkout and our departure for LaGuardia. I hope and pray the new owners maintain the service and facility and don’t increase the reasonable (for NYC) rates.

I visited NYC to go shopping and see some sights, this hotel was central, near to broadway, near to the train stations, near to shopping, NBC studios and so on. Lots of activity nearby including getting to a tour bus. HAd all the basic amenities in the room and a comfy bed.... VERY IMPORTANT after walking up and down each day. The room that I was assigned did not have much of a view - just the back of buildings across the street.. But it was all good. helpful front desk. easy check in and out and business centre you can print your boarding pass for travel.

I left the hotel and walked the half block to Times Square arrived back at the hotel as 12:15 and the room was ready to check in to.I was given a relative large room on the 5th floor which was very clean and looked inviting. Room included a microwave and a fridge, neither of which I needed but nice to know they were there. I was a little skeptical of the noise factor as the room faced 46th St but it was relatively quiet.The hotel offers free ""unsecured"" wifi and a continental breakfast. I opted for a full breakfast at a pub around the corner. They also have soap and shampoo dispensers in the bathroom so you do have to deal with small bars of soap.

We couldn't justify the price to stay there without the package, so we moved to the Broadway @ Times Square for the last two nights of our trip. The Marriott Marquis it is not, but this hotel did have some great things going for it.Pros:The location... just a block or two from Times Square and a short walk to Avenue of the Americas. There were lots of great restaurants nearby as well.Staff - Everyone we encountered on the staff from the front desk, to the baggage valet, to the maid were very friendly and helpful.Free breakfast - it's a very basic breakfast (yogurt, fruit, toast, hard boiled eggs, cereal, coffee, etc) but it's free! With how pricey things are in NYC free food is an excellent bonus.Rooms - were clean, beds were comfortable. They have soap and shampoo dispensers as opposed to the little bottles. I prefer the dispensers as it cuts down on waste and is more environmentally friendly.Cons:Rooms - While the bedding and bathroom was clean, the room was cleaned with a very strong perfumey type cleaner... the smell was so strong that we had to open a window to air it out. I sometimes feel hotels do this to give the impression the room is clean and fresh when it is actually not. That being said, the floor and wall paper were definitely in need of a deep cleaning and/or refresh. The room we were given was also VERY small... like once you get the bed in there there isn't much floor space for anything else. There was a very spacious closet though but no in room fridge. No view - Like I mentioned we had come from the Marriott Marquis where we were given a large room on the 20th floor with views of the NYC city skyline. When we looked out of our window at the Broadway @ Times Square we saw a brick wall. Overall, we did like our stay and had we not stayed at the Marquis prior to staying here we would have found these accommodations adequate.

Nobody told us that we are not allowed inside to park the car, we've been kicked out of the car, with kids and luggage, while the car was half in and half on the sidewalk. The front desk area seemed to be nice and clean, soon we discovered that it is the only area like that. The room was a total disappointment. A tiny room, 2 queen beds so close to the walls that you could barely walk in between. One of them was six inches away from the air condition unit that was blowing right towards it. To get to the bathroom you had to squeeze yourself in between the bed and the TV stand. The carpet was a dark color, mostly due to accumulated dirt. Everywhere it looked like nobody cleaned the dust in a while. The wallpaper was peeled off and it had a grey look. In the bathroom the vent was full of dust. The smell in the room was almost moldy but they tried to cover it with a lot of perfume.Breakfast was a joke. Same thing every day. Boiled eggs, bagels, doughnuts, apples, bananas, cream cheese, butter, cereals and milk. In one morning we arrived at 9:30 am, while the breakfast is served until 10 am. Everything was completely empty. When I went to the front desk to ask for some food, another employee, that was just sitting there chatting, told me that is to late because in a few minutes the breakfast will be over. When he saw that his answer almost made me explode of anger, he quickly went to the breakfast area and started to pull out of a closet different things to eat. After that he had to refill it several times, since more guests came in.I thought to change the hotel but it was in too short notice and they would have charged me the first night anyway.The only good thing about this hotel is its location, just a block away from Times Square.Over all, if you have standards, pick another place to spend the nights in New York.",,Cristi S,4,1.0

The reception and breakfast area have been renovated but the rooms are tired, dated and on the small side. Breakfast was a massive let down unless you like doughnuts and even then the cheap long life large box type. I understand this hotel offers only continental breakfast but slow cooked pre-shelled boiled eggs (literally being kept warm in a slow cooker),long life yoghurts, bread for toast etc and a fruit choice of bananas and apples served on paper plates with plastic cutlery did not make the mark, oh and the coffee was dreadful too. As stated the bedrooms need an overhaul, there was clean linen and towels but the carpet and shower area were ingrained with dirt (due to age, not the dirt that hoovers up). Due to the room size, you have to shuffle around the cupboard door to get to the safe, taking care not to smash your toes in the process as you cannot step back due to another piece of furniture. However if you are after a good location near Times Square then this is the place for you, but if you want any quality, look somewhere else.

The rooms were better than 3 star and would honestly say between 3.5-4.0 overall. The cleanliness was very good. The continental breakfast is definitely a 4.0 and was very good for a start every day. The local NYC prices for food are very high so having drinks and some nice basic breakfast every day was a real treat. The room price was very good but the Apple Core chain itself are priced properly. This location is 300 feet from Times Square. There are several noisy restaurants close by. The luggage steward on arrival was lacking any service and the front counter staff were friendly but recommended walking the 300 feet and hail a cab on Broadway ourselves, which we did and became very successful at it. I pre-booked VIP airport pickup and redelivery thru USA Guided Tours and I was very happy with that but I would recommend that you use the GO bus thru the hotel staff as it was a lot cheaper but realize it is by the person whereas USA was by the vehicle and if you 3 or more folks it could be cheaper just to have VIP services do it. The front desk had many months to put us together with rooms but did not set aside rooms close by but 2 floors away which was NOT convenient. We was told to try and change rooms the next day. If they had done it right the first time we would have to try anything. I even called and they were not friendly or helpful on the phone to get it done months in advance.

I know to expect smaller rooms, and I even try to avoid the major chains and stay at the boutique hotels when the price and location are right. So when I saw all the excellent reviews for Broadway at Times Square Hotel, I gave it a try. But this hotel goes beyond ""boutique"" - small is one thing, but this was a pit. First, a hotel can be small and still be modern and useful - like the Cambria. But Broadway at Times Square was not useful. It was old and cramped. To start, the elevators are so tiny 3 of us barely fit with our bags. If you needed a luggage cart, forget it. The housekeeper got on with her cart and pushed us into the corner - it was that tiny and claustrophobic. The hallway outside of the elevator is also so slim that only 4 people can wait in the hallway for an elevator. On either side of the hallway is a fire door leading to 2 rooms. So if there was anyone waiting for the elevator, you had to basically wait in your room. OK, so much for fit. The condition of our room was so disappointing. Our room was beat - peeling wallpaper, rust on the bathroom window, tiny old rusty sink, no internet service, no place to put your suitcase. Luckily, it was a one-night stay. Maybe there are better rooms at this hotel and that's why so many good reviews? I feel like the reviews I read were for another property. I didn't realize when I booked that this was ""formerly Comfort Inn"" -- maybe that should have been a clue.","Northern Virginia, Virginia","PHinNOVA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northern Virginia, Virginia</strong>",23,1.0

There were some good things and some bad things. Let’s start with the good. The location and price was very reasonable (according to our research). Just a block from Times Square, close to subways, bus lines, restaurants, theatres, the Rockefeller center and a 15 minutes walk away from a lot of the midtown attractions. The staff was very friendly and the room was fairly spacious by NYC standards. Now the bad. The room was a little stinky/musky smelling. The carpet was damp, yes damp. Not sure where the smell came from, ventilation, moisture, or what? But that should be taken care of for future folks. I have read several reviews on here about the smell, so I am sure it wasn’t just the room we were in. The breakfast wasn’t good at all. I just went for a cuppa joe and a couple donuts every morning. If you are a breakfast person you will be going out every day. The room we were in did not have a microwave or refrigerator, so that was a bit disappointing. And only one elevator. I guess it’s not so easy to add another...We were basically in our room just to sleep, so most of the complaints I have, we could live with for the price we paid on our first trip to NYC.

As it turns out, a cleaning person accidentally tripped the fire alarm, but the night staff didn't know how to disable it. We, ever cautiously although there was no hint of smoke, made our way downstairs (literally, not using the elevator) to the lobby, where the night manager sheepishly confessed to the cause of our rude awakening. After about 15 minutes they figured out how to use the PA system, notified the mostly still-room-bound guests of the error, and a few minutes later managed to turn off the lights and sound. Training is in order, don't you think? Located just one-half block East of famed Times Square on 46th Street, this nicely remodeled six-story property features adequate if tiny rooms, well-designed with charging stations for your devices, a desk, hairdryer and iron, a super-tiny closet (we had to remove the luggage rack to make room for clothing), and a tiled and well-appointed bathroom. Linens and towels are high-quality, the bed is comfortable, and the WIFI is no-charge. A respectably good deal for the price. We also enjoyed a continental breakfast featuring all the stuff you'd expect, and maybe more considering the fresh-every-morning NYC donuts, yogurt, and bagels, included at no extra charge. I believe in rating properties by comparing them to their peers, not to higher- or lower-priced alternatives, and the Broadway would have won a ""5"" had it not been for the careless alarm event. We'd stay there again when returning to Times Square and the Theatres along Broadway.","Provo, Utah","Stevan D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Provo, Utah</strong>",286,4.0

Given queen room 700 , which although compact and dated, ( the paint work could do with being freshened up and the carpets could be brighter. ) it was ample for the short time we were going to be in it. The room was extremely quiet, no street noise and warm . Too warm , as we had to turn the A/c heating off. The room had ample storage with a safe , coffee and tea maker, iron & board, very comfortable bed and if you wanted, the linen and towels would be changed daily. The bathroom which was large enough, had a low bath with shower and dispensers for shampoo, shower gel, soap and body lotion. There was also a diffused night light incorporated in the hairdryer, great for reducing disturbance if visiting the bathroom through the night.  A nice little feature was the cube clock, with 2 USB ports and 2 A/c outlets. The room door with keyless access, had a deadlock and security door stop.  In the evening, we were always met by a security guard at the entrance. The elevator was not the quickest, sometimes you had to wait couple of minutes , as it served all 9 floors and lower level. The floor tiles down the staircase were immaculately clean as was the reception area, an achievement in its self.  Down in the lobby is a business centre with 2 computers, printer and fax. Also next to reception is a small fitness centre, with cold water dispenser and cups. Free Daily papers are also available here.  The breakfast area is kept clean and well stocked by a very helpful Jovianne, who works tirelessly to ensure his guests know how things work and what is available. Mainly breads, cereals, bagels, eggs , yoghurts, fruits and refreshments. Enough to set you up for the morning.  For getting about, the Orange line subway is 1 block up on 47th Ave , a 200 metres walk from the hotel, this will take you to Central station; where you can access all lines. There are some great little bars for food and drink on E 44th Ave, we used O' Donohues, the staff came over more friendly than some and they remembered you! Finally after storing our luggage until mid afternoon , reception pre booked a private taxi to the airport , a flat rate of $ 65 . Well done to all concerned for making our stay memorable and pleasurable!","Lake District, United Kingdom","eltel432016</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lake District, United Kingdom</strong>",182,4.0

The coffee seemed to be always available; and rooms had a refrigerator, microwave, safe, TV and adequate shower. The location is both in the middle of the action, yet on a relatively quiet block. I asked for a quiet room and was offered a rear room on the second floor, which was both quiet and convenient to the lobby without needing to rely on the hotel's only elevator, which might have been a frustrating factor if I had stayed on a higher floor. This property is a great option for a recreational trip to the Midtown/Theater district.

We weren't thrilled, but after more than 10 calls, the desk couldn't find another place with an opening, so they explored options within the facility. Magically, they found a room which we went to and had for the following four nights. I'm guessing someone was coming in even later than we and we ended up with the room, but I didn't ask. I didn't want to know. We had the room as planned and onward.The room was small, but comfortable. I believe, based on the map, every room is slightly different in size and shape. The bathroom is comically tiny, but works well if you are used to your partner's routine, and my wife and I have it down. All the 'stuff' worked as it should, but the smallness of the made temperature control an interesting issue. We did fine, but anticipating a quickly heating or cooling room is imperative. We had no noise issues. Breakfast was reasonable and the space was more than sufficient for the traffic. Desk help was always available and was indeed helpful. Location was the reason for our choice and it was close to Times Square, so that made us happy. There was construction on the adjoining building so navigating scaffolding was necessary every time we came in or left. We noticed the majority of folks at breakfast were European, with English, at least American English, not in the first two languages spoken. No problem, just an observation. We might try another hotel in the area next time, but we'd also be more than comfortable at the Broadway.

The lady that checked us in, a Sikh gentleman who sometimes was at the front desk, and both of the bellmen we met while staying there were nice. The lady who checked us in went out of her way to check with housekeeping when we had arrived to see if a room had been finished. The other person at the front counter when we tried checking in early took 2 seconds to look at the computer and tell us no. When we did get to the room it was underwhelming. It was ""clean"" but there were other issues. The one good thing is we didn't get bedbugs (which was a concern when we saw the room).While we were standing at the front counter waiting to hear about a room we noticed a sign posted that water would be off in the hotel starting at Noon that day with no end time provided. We were assured it would only be off for three hours (To be fair, this time period is between standard checkout and checkin). While waiting to get on the elevator we heard one of the front desk staff say it would be 3 or 4 hours. They then followed that with should be no more than 4 hours. We were heading out to Central Park for the afternoon so it didn't really matter too much to us but was a point of concern such that we looked for other hotels nearby to transfer too if the water was still out when we returned. The water was on when we returned but the lines had not been flushed in the rooms and the water was very, very brown and had a bit of an oder to it. We let the water run in the sink and tub for a while and it cleared fairly quickly but put us off drinking it. We went and got bottled water at Duane Reed to use for toothbrushing, contacts, and such. The room stunk of must and mildew. The AC unit smelled musty at best and like urine at the worst. If the AC unit got turned off or the temperature turned down too low the smell would get pretty bad. The carpets in the room don't look to have been steamcleaned since President Bush was in office (43 or 41, I couldn't say). The bed sheets did seem to be clean. They looked and smelled laundered and the bed was in decent shape. We didn't get bed bugs so, all in all, it was okay. The bathroom and towels were clean. We had one housekeeper the first day we stayed who was pleasant. The gal that was there the rest of the time seemed to have a perpetual frown and a matching attitude. She was NOT happy one morning at 9am when she knocked on the door wanting to clean the room. When we asked to come back later she wanted to know when we would be gone and wasn't thrilled when I gave a time range. Same with the guy down in the breakfast area. The issue with the water had put us off eating the light continental breakfast they offer and we went out for breakfast anyway but still yet another surly person. I thought we could save some money by moving from the Marriott after a conference. This will teach me to try and save a buck.

The hallways were one way streets and when we opened the door to the room it was no better, as it was tiny. I think if you get the ones with a king bed they are bigger (they have to be a king bed wouldn't fit in our room) so make sure you reserve a king bed. You had a bed and enough space to walk around it and that was about it. But in its defense I will say it was clean, the bed was ok and when you are in NY its not like you stay in your room anyway!

We wanted to be centrally located in Times Square but not pay a crazy price. I feel we made a fantastic choice!In doing my research, I didn't find many hotels that offer free continental breakfast and this one does. Granted, it was VERY basic. Lots of carbs and not much else but it was free and gave us a start to the day. White bagels, white bread, donuts, muffins, waffles, 2 cereals, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, watered down juice, apples and bananas. It was ok. But again, it was free. Would have been great to change up the fruit options like maybe oranges one day. Also, maybe some whole wheat options instead of just white bread everyday.Also, we really wanted our room to have 2 beds and many of the options only had 1 Queen or King bed. This hotel had 2 beds so that was another plus.Everything was clean and updated. The lobby was pretty contemporary. Our room was small but livable. Most of the room was filled up by the 2 beds. But they still squeezed in a table w/ TV and a desk and chair.The location is fantastic. 1/2 block from Times Square. But at night, trying to go to sleep, you wouldn't know it. I never heard a thing. Never had a hard time falling asleep. Absolutely no view out the window but who cares. We were only in the room to sleep. The view was of the wall of the neighboring building.We arrived a little early before check in time and our room wasn't ready so they had a guy to help check your bags into a storage room until the room was ready. That way we could head out into the city to explore a bit and then come back later to settle into our room.There was a little sign in the bathroom to hang your towel up if you didn't want it washed or put it on the floor if you did want it washed. So the first morning, we left our towels hung up so we could save water by reusing them. We returned to the hotel later that day to our towels missing and replaced by new folded ones. Why put a sign that says what to do if you are just going to replace them everyday? This happened each day even though we followed the instructions to hang them up.There is shampoo and shower gel in the shower. Only thing is that the shampoo was so liquidy/runny that I would squirt it in my hand and it would run off into the tub before I could get my hand to my head. Maybe the hotel should invest in a little higher quality shampoo.All the staff we encountered were friendly. Ran into the cleaning ladies a few times and they chatted with us and were very friendly. Made sure we had everything we needed. The guys at the front desk were very helpful. They helped us get a taxi to the airport the day we departed. There were a few times where multiple people were at the desk needing help and they managed the crowd well.Overall, this hotel was perfect for us. We didn't need anything fancy. Something affordable (for Times Square NY standards), clean and great location.

On the plus side, the staff at this hotel are wonderful - everyone always had a smile on their face and a friendly greeting. The front desk staff were always ready to offer a hand with anything we needed and generally everyone was very accommodating. The breakfast that is included in the room was a huge plus, as we found NYC to be quite expensive for restaurant eating. It is stated to be a continental breakfast, but we found it to be ample, with lots of choices from fresh fruit and yogurt, to boiled eggs, to waffles and pancakes, and, our favourite, amazing bagels. The rooms, though small, were very clean and the bed was quite comfortable, with good pillows. There is also a safe in the room for our passports and other things that we didn't want to carry with us all the time. The fitness room looked good, although we didn't use it, and the business centre, which is also complimentary, was very handy for booking some sights and tours in advance and printing off our tickets.

Second pro - two queen beds.Most NYC hotels seemed to have plenty of rooms with two full beds, but this was one of the few that had queens, which was necessary for our family of four to sleep comfortably. Third pro - the breakfast. While not fancy necessarily, there were plenty of simple, filling options that saved us an estimated $20-$30, had we ordered those same options at a restaurant. The decor is old school hotel versus a more trendy look, but the rooms are clean and comfortable. As other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms are small - but what rooms aren't in NYC?

Since the tickets were so expensive, we needed a moderately priced hotel to balance the budget, but wanted to be near Times Square. This hotel met all expectations. It was a smaller hotel that is literally a block from the Richard Rodgers- you can see Times Square from the entrance of the building when there isn't construction going on next door. The room was NYC sized, and we did not have a view from the window (it was just brick outside). However, this is balanced by its proximity to everything- Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Grand Central, and train/subway lines all around it. It could not be more convenient for a trip to NYC. We were able to leave our stuff in the room and pop in if we needed anything without going out of our way. The front desk staff was great. They were very kind and accommodating and after the first day recognized my partner and I and greeted us on our return. The maintenance guy was a bit grumpy when we needed help in our room (the bathroom window didn't shut all the way, and in the middle of 20 degrees weather I needed it closed!) Breakfast is simple- pancakes/waffles, cereal, toast/bagels, yogurt, and eggs. I mostly used the free breakfast to start my day and then ended up eating well for lunch and dinner.

It is also one of the few hotels in New York to offer a room with 2 queen beds, making it an easier sleep for our family of 4 with two teens. This hotel is about 2 blocks down the street from Hamilton the musical. Everything Times-Squarish/Theaterish is a no-problem stroll. And the noise really isn't too bad inside the hotel. Sometimes we could hear the people in the next room but they tended to pass out quickly!The room is indeed tiny. It's definitely a one-way street to go from the bed to the bathroom, or the bed to the closet, or the bathroom to the front door, etc. Just get everyone coordinated and you'll be fine. The room was clean. The beds and pillows were super comfy. We had a view of a wall but the room still got good light. The wifi was free, good and fast (we were on 5th floor.) The business center was in good working order and we were successfully able to print things.The bath always had warm water. One thing to note -- when I refilled my water bottle from the sink, it came out a milky white. It turned out to be minerals and after a couple of minutes it cleared up. It was a little jarring, but I promise you will not die. Or, at least, I haven't yet.The best part of breakfast is that it exists. We had fruit, yogurt, donuts and cereal most mornings, but there were eggo-style waffles and hard-boiled eggs available. The coffee was really not that great, and I'm pretty easy in that department ... so I'd suggest really gussying it up with sugar/milk, making your own in the room (coffee maker) or going out. The breakfast room was large and clean. The hotel lobby is very nice and modern with plenty of places to sit. There was only one elevator, but we never had to wait long and it was always in working order. The hotel contains only 79 rooms. We were able to check in an hour early which was of great help to us, and it marks the first time EVER we have been able to check in early anywhere in NYC.If you get your parking ticket from the garage listed on the hotel's website validated, you will get a great rate. We parked our car for 3.5 days and only paid $78. That is an amazing rate in Manhattan! They do charge more for SUVs or luxury cars, but we just have a dopey old Toyota.I'm not sure where the staff-to-rave-about was. In all of our time there we only had one perky person ever say hello to us when we entered the lobby. And the maids were very nice. The rest never made eye contact or offered any sort of greeting. They were not impolite, just not very friendly. It's NYC though, those hard, jaded city people!Honestly, an overall good experience. I would stay again.

Being two ladies alone in the city, I felt totally safe and had no issues whatsoever. The staff was very helpful and the continental breakfast was a welcome treat. How many hotels have FREE breakfasts in NYC!? We even took a piece of fruit to go for a snack. I noted on the reviews that a few complained about the size of the rooms, but I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of space we had. The bed was so comfy! Seriously, I hate hotel beds, and my daughter and I agreed that this was the best hotel bed we've ever slept in, a queen size which was great with very nice pillows too.

It's literally a few steps away from Times Square and very near to other main attractions such as Rockefeller Center, Radio City music hall and 5th Avenue shopping. The location is excellent. Also once inside it's quiet and you don't hear the noise of Times Square.The hotel is very modern, the lobby is quite attractive. The room was nice, well appointed, clean and comfortable. I have no complaints about the room whatsoever. What I will say though is that the hallways are very narrow, which isn't much of a problem except for the fact that you hear other nearby guests going into and out of their rooms which at night can be a bit disruptive. We got continental breakfast included which was decent enough. It's not extensive, but the options are satisfactory. The staff are for the most part very friendly, courteous and helpful.

The hotel sign is fairly small but my husband spotted it. Parked our car check-in was at 3pm we arrived early. I suggest to have hotel hold your bags we didn't took a bit for garage to get our bags cars are stacked and hard to get to. Front of hotel looks like a brownstone it's a nice small hotel I felt it was homey for a hotel. Nice clean modern. Check-in went well very friendly staff.

We looked at over 50 different hotels and not one them offered free breakfast, free wi-fi, two beds and a price that we could afford for a week long vacation. Until we found this one. My sister and I were both very impressed with this hotel. All members of the staff were friendly, courteous and ready to assist us with anything we needed during our stay. The free confidential breakfast did not skimp on options and included fresh donuts, cereal, waffles, yogurt, fruit and a variety of other choices.The double room itself was a bit on the small side - for example, if someone is sitting at the desk, there is no room to walk in front of the beds to get to the bathroom. But, we weren't in the room very much and since we are both young, we could just climb over the beds. But, it is something to note for people with physical limitations. The room was clean, the beds were very comfortable, and the most pleasant surprise of all - the room was very quiet, even on the second floor. We stayed there for a week and I never heard so much as a single siren from outside, despite being less than a block away from Times Square. Indeed, the only sound the permeated the room was the sound of church bells from the late-1800s church next door, which was actually quite nice. If I wasn't already up when they were ringing, they did not wake me. The sound of other doors slamming was pretty loud, but there was almost none of that after 11:00 PM or so. This may seem silly, but my favorite thing was the window-seat style window frame in the bathroom. When space is limited, having that extra shelf to place things on, such as a change of clothes when showering, was a real life saver. Wi-Fi was free, fast and easy to use. No problems at all. And finally location. The location of this hotel could not be better, especially if you're a Broadway lover me. As I already mentioned, the hotel is less than a block away from Times Square and as such, all the major Broadway theaters are a ten minute walk or less. We were able to see a show every night we were in the city because our close proximity to the theater box offices allowed us to be there when they opened in the morning. All the must-see sights of mid-town Manhattan are easily within walking distance and those that are downtown or uptown can be quickly reached by subway.The official pictures of the hotel are accurate.

It's very convenient for that due to its location, and is only one block from the subway lines that go down to Herald Square (a couple blocks from Penn Station, I arrive/go by train). The rooms have comfortable beds, are clean and well-equipped. I always ask for a room that does NOT look over the street for quiet reasons, and one away from the elevator although that tip is true for any hotel. This hotel is considerate in that they have door closers on the doors leading to the elevator foyer, unlike many hotels where they can slam. The front desk staff is polite and helpful. I don't eat breakfast so have no opinion and don't care about that. They have a coffeemaker in the room. The rooms are small, of course, but I've had smaller in the budget category (like the Paramount nearby). This hotel has extremely reasonable rates compared to any nearby hotel that I know of, sometimes by hundreds of dollars (not usually that bad, but recently I was there over Columbus Day weekend and nearby moderate hotels were charging $500 or more a night for some reason I couldn't figure and this hotel was less than $300). It's easy to walk to decent restaurants in hell's kitchen or west of Broadway. Of course it is a total zoo right around Times Square itself, I would never stay here if I weren't going to the theater as the crowds can be so bad you have trouble walking in the streets. It's just a good location for short theater trips and convenient subway access. YOu can walk east a few blocks to the buses that go up Madison to the museums or come down Fifth to return, also. The only thing I don't like about this hotel is the TV is set parallel to the bed due to the room configuration of walls/windows, which makes it difficult to watch TV easily. I don't know why they didn't just put the flat screen on the wall in front of the bed, which could solve that problem.

Check-in was quick and smooth; the lobby has two generously-sized seating areas and the 'business center' consists of two desktop computers in a corner of the lobby. There is just one elevator to serve the hotel's 9 floors but the waiting times weren't too bad. The 'fitness center' is a very small room with a couple of treadmills and elliptical trainers - no weights or other fitness equipment. If you want a decent workout you can buy a day pass for $10 to the fitness center at the Sheraton a few blocks uptown. Continental breakfast is included although I didn't take advantage of it so can't comment on the offerings or quality. The room itself is tiny, but not out of the ordinary by NYC standards for a 2- to 3-star hotel. Cleanliness was good overall but my one complaint is that the carpets were filthy and in dire need of a deep shampooing - bring flip-flops or keep your socks on! Despite a few minor shortcomings I'd stay here again and recommend it to others - during the week of the US Open I paid a rate of just $150 per night and it just doesn't get better than that in the Times Square area.",San Francisco,"brokerchick</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco</strong>",18,3.0

My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights, we got there like at 12 and they allowed us to check in, even though it is not until 3 pm. The room was quite small but you don't go to new york to stay on the hotel so that wasn't a problem at all. Ask for a higher level room so the noise doesn't bother u. The hotel is located in a perfect place. You get out of the hotel turn right and you are already at the heart of Times Square. 15 min walk to central park. They have breakfast included, which is very good and very convenient. They have a variety of stuff like pancakes, waffles, eggs, bagels, donuts, butter and cream cheese for the bread. They also have yogurt milk juice coffee tea , bananas apple. I loved it, plus you don't need to spend more money on breakfast cuz its already included. They have computers wifi and printers, we had to print out boarding pass and we used their printer. Also, for the check out you can leave your luggage with them, they have a little room where they put them and they give you a little card for each bag so they know which one is yours. Which is awesome because you don't have to be walking around the city with your stuff. That way you can enjoy your last hours in NY. The only thing I didn't like was last day, the guy that was in charge of the luggage room, he was nice at first but at the end he was kind of telling us stupids for using uber. He said that ""in NY you don't do Uber, because of the traffic "" idk how am I supposed to get to the airport, I think he said that because they can call someone to pick you up if you want to, I guess they get commission for it and he was upset cuz we used uber instead.

Our reservation was booked through applecorehotels and when we arrived many hours prior to check-in (7:30am), without asking, the manager was happy to hold our luggage until our room was ready, and offered us breakfast (although we technically weren't guests yet)! The breakfast host was friendly and did a good job keeping items stocked. Breakfast included yogurt, muffins, pancakes, waffles, boiled eggs, donuts, oatmeal, tea, juice and coffee... no meat.Since the hotel was able to hold our luggage, this allowed us time to get an early start wandering the city. The subway we used most often 49th/7th was fairly easy to get to. We decided to take the train down to Staten Island to see Lady Liberty. By the time we took the ferry, stopped at the 9/11 memorial, and back to Midtown to shop at the Lego store, our room was ready by Noon... still hours earlier than expected!Upon check-in, I was able to get an additional discount using my AAA card!Our room was on the 5th floor, the doorman handled our belongings and the elevators were fairly quick. Our Deluxe King room was just spacious enough for the two of us. In room 507 there is no view, but it was quiet. Comfy bedding, coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator were the best features of the room, imo. The 2nd night I asked to change rooms and management was happy to oblige without question and moved us to room 907. Same layout, corner room, different view. We could see a bit of Times Square, the steeple of the church next door and the rooftop of a bar/restaurant. In addition, the price of the Deluxe King had gone down on their website, and I was able to take advantage of the discount. The room(s) ended up being $30-$60 per night cheaper than when I initially made my reservation. Winning!There is a 24 hour deli/grill/grocery right across the street from the hotel called Cafe Abbondanza and they have fresh foods, some grocery, and yummy made to order items that are reasonably priced. There is also seating upstairs. We shopped items for our fridge there and also at a Food Emporium on 8th. Upon check-out, the front desk was able to arrange car service to LaGuardia for a flat cash fee of $50. I think Uber would've been a little cheaper, but I didn't have a problem using their car service.Yes, I would definitely stay at this hotel again (only) if I wanted to be in the heart of it all and have a decent place to lay my head.","Columbus, Ohio","marque235</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>",5,5.0

They have parking arrangements with a garage conveniently located just across the street at a discounted price so take advantage if you are driving in. I mistakenly noted only 1 guest on my reservation and the nice fellow at the desk only charged me an extra $15 instead of the usual $30 for having a second guest in the room (figured that was better than having my husband sleep in the lobby). The hotel is not opulent by any means but our room on the second floor, although lacking any view, was quiet, clean and had a nice comfortable bed. We also had a room safe in the closet, a mini fridge and microwave. Staff was friendly and although the continental breakfast they served was not spectacular, the bagels were nice and fresh and the coffee was very good.

But this room with two double beds was SO small we couldn't roll our suitcase in the room because the foot of the bed nearly touched the desk and chair !! I called the front desk to please remove the desk! Which they did! Very happy with their service but I do not recommend this hotel if you have more than two people to a room. We had 3 the first night and then just 2 the remaining time. For us 2 it was fine but 3 and 4 would be too cramped. And my friend kept her suitcase on the half the bed and I put mine where the desk was previously!! Also...the breakfast was all carbs. Besides boiled eggs that looked sketchy. I like hot eggs and bacon and fruit. The fruit was apples and bananas. Well...we got bananas one day. No other days. Overall...I wouldn't choose this hotel again...there was also a fight in the hallway around 3am that frightened me. Screaming men n the hallway. I'm guessing security was called immediately and it was taken care of. But the walls are very thin and we could hear the man next door hacking and clearing his throat Early in the morning as well!

The room was nice, but small. I had 2 plumbing issues. If i turned on the shower to the right temperature the whole room vibrated. So I had to either take a cold shower or a too hot shower. Obviously I took the cold route. I told the front desk that I had the problem and also that the toilet ran incessantly. The next morning I told them the problem had not been fixed. The 3rd morning I just let it bang and bang. My friend said to me ""did you hear all that construction at 8 this morning?"" and I explained what was going on. I waited for the manager to come in and told her that I felt that if they couldnt fix the problem they should have let me know. She knew nothing about it so I brought her up to the room and let her hear the noise. At 6 that evening she was still waiting for a plumber. The next morning it was fixed. I asked if my bill could be reduced somewhat because of my inconvenience. The front desk girl said no.I went to get my car and they rang up the bill and I said that I was told the parking was $26/ day not $55. He said I needed a stamp from the hotel. No one told me I needed a stamp. They only told me the parking was half price if I was staying at the hotel. I asked if he could cancel my transaction and rerun it if I went back to get a stamp. He said no. I hate feeling cheated. Life is tough enough without having the deck stacked against you. The bellman was very grumpy and said he hated working there. He said he is underpaid and can't wait to find another job. That's not my problem and I don't want to hear his woes.

I did not pick this hotel to stay in - a relative did but I enjoyed my stay very much. This hotel, (not to be confused with its sister hotel - The Hotel at Times Square) was off of the crazy Broadway but is a very convenient location if you are going to a Broadway show. The rate was reasonable and check in was a breeze. We were given an upgraded room because our room style wasn't ready when we checked in - EARLY! That was nice. In fact, everyone employee we encountered - the check-in and check-out clerks, housekeeping staff, the breakfast room attendant- were all very nice and professional. The hotel is small and the hallways are tiny. I was glad I didn't have a big suitcase. That might have made it hard to navigate out of the elevator. The room was a normal NYC size room. The bed was very comfortable. It wasn’t the most luxurious room I’ve every stayed in but it was clean and had everything you needed and more. It came with free wi-fi, a microwave and refrigerator which I wouldn’t have expected for the rate. We were lucky to get a room at the back of the hotel so we didn’t hear any street noise. The lotion, soap and shampoo were in refillable pumps which I had never seen before in a hotel and have mixed feelings about. On one hand, it is very smart and eco-friendly for a hotel to have. But on the other, I do like having a bar of soap in the shower. I was disappointed that the windows didn’t open. We love fresh air whenever possible. There isn’t a restaurant or bar on premises but the free, extensive, continental breakfast was all we needed to get started in the morning and there were plenty of places all around for our meals and nightcaps.

We had the benefit of reserving the hotel by way of free cancellation through booking.com up to one day before arrival so we did have that to fall back on.We made the right decision to fulfil the booking.Most hotels you attend will normally have a welcoming reception which looks very smart. This one was no exception. On the same floor was an area to use the Internet and print were required free of charge. Further down was a very small room which houses a running machine, bike and cross trainer. We never used it but would of if we hadn't done so much walking !!Staff were in attendance at all times and were very helpful.The main seated area was the breakfast room. This does have UK football on match days which was handy when we ate our breakfast one morning at 1000. Breakfast is included within the price and is excellent and offers the following :Toast (make yourself)BagelsFruitYoghurtPorridgeDonutsTea, Coffee and juiceAll help yourself but a member of staff was normally round so it's nice to drop him a couple of dollars as he does keep the area clean.Tea and coffee is available anytime free of charge.Our room was on the top floor and whilst looking old was clean and acceptable. Lots of plugs available for charging phones, laptops etc. TV was good as the reception was quality with a large amount of channels on offer. There was a heater in the room which was AC or Heat with the latter being on as it was -17 outside during our stay. There was a large wardrobe for the storage of clothes as well as your cases. Within this area there was also a safe which was free and very easy to operate.WIFI is available in the room with no restrictions on the number of items which connected. Signal was excellent throughout the stay with the odd refresh of the connection if you wanted to FaceTime.Bathroom was today albeit it cold but when the door was closed you couldn't feel how cold it was. It did however ice up on one morning giving the water we bought a nice cold taste. It was a very small bath so more a shower use but it was very difficult to get the shower to work to a temperature which wasn't burning hot.Location wise, what can you say - excellent !! Come out the hotel , turn right and walk 200 yards and you are on Times Square. Access to the majority of Broadway shows within 10 minutes, subway within two minutes. 5th Avenue was a 10-15 minute walk left out the hotel with Macy's about 12 blocks away but lots to look at on route.There are a number of bars opposite the hotel and all sold food. We didn't visit these but noticed that the prices appeared reasonable for the area and they did have happy hours every night. There is also an excellent deli offering fresh sandwiches should you not wish to venture out or if you are waiting for a transfer to the airport.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. So much so, we will be booking there next time we stay and my wife has recommended it for her girlie trip next year. Having visited NYC on three previous occasions it has been the best value for money especially with the $10-15 per day saving made for free breakfast and wifi.","Liverpool, United Kingdom","scousemanblue</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Liverpool, United Kingdom</strong>",22,5.0

It is right in around the corner from Times square. Took us literally less than 1 minute to walk there. We hot-wired and got this hotel at like $100 a night which was pretty great considering where it is!It is right beside a T.G.I.F's restaurant if you get hungry and across the street is a variety store and a bunch of bars! LCOATION:Perfect location. Right around the corner from main square in times square! Make sure you don't miss it. The sign for the hotel is small so keep your eyes peeked. Its right beside TGIF! ROOMS:Rooms are a good size with a bed, and a desk and the bathroom is normal! Read lots of reviews complaining about the size of the room. This room isn't any smaller than any other hotel room i've stayed in. The hallways and elevator are tiny but the rooms aren't bad. It has a bed and the bathroom has a toilet, and shower ... all you need. The rooms also have a small tv and a radio/alarm clock! We didnt get a nice view but thats okay! We were in room 300 and we actually had a view of a brick wall ahaha BREAKFAST:Continental breakfast from 6-10 am in the downstairs room (small - all there is, is a lobby and the breakfast room).Lots of choices for breakfast!! There is pancakes, waffles, fruit (banana's & apples), toast, jam, bagels, muffins, cinnamon rolls, cereal, oatmeal, boiled eggs, etc. There is also coffee, and tea which they have all day in the kitchen/ breakfast room. We always took a couple bananas and apple for the road!! GYM:Right off the lobby. Very small. Only has 3 machines. A treadmill, bike and elliptical. Went all 3 days i was there and never saw anyone using it. Also has a water machine in there so you can fill up your water bottle!! So you don't need to buy one when you are out. Just reuse yours and fill the water up there.Overall a great stay! The front desk staff is very nice and the one gentleman that woks in the breakfast hall is super nice and helpful!

Just got back from a two day stay and I just might not book here again. I reserved 2 rooms at the hotel for this recent stay when I was there in August. Two days before my arrival this past week, I received my customary ""Pre Arrival Confirmation"" stating I was confirmed for my 2 rooms. Upon checking in, I was told by Julio that my reservations were canceled due to my credit card being canceled and that there were not 2 rooms available. He said there was nothing he could do. I had been using that credit card continuously so I honestly could not understand how this would happen. This, despite the fact that I had my confirmation from the hotel, and this, despite the fact, that I stay at this hotel a minimum of 4 to 5 times every year. I was very upset and embarrassed. Julio said he could try to find us another hotel but I didn't want another hotel. Plus, it was the day of the Christmas Tree lighting in Rockefeller Center (Dec 1) so it would probably be a bit difficult. When I spoke to the manager, she finally did find us the two rooms I had reserved by changing someone from one room to another. I called my credit card company and they said my card was never denied by any company, including this hotel. Later that afternoon, we observed the SAME thing happening to another guest. Maybe it was the hotel's fault, not their guests! I still am unhappy about this, especially since I brought 3 friends with me. I was not treated like a guest and the manager and the hotel did nothing to make me feel like I should return.","Williamsville, New York","Ann1948</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Williamsville, New York</strong>",29,3.0

I am pretty sure this place was renovated recently from a hostel, I felt like it was a Hostel on steroids. NYC is a city to be explored. Spend your money on the millions of good restaurants, shows, stores, vendors, and bars instead of spending all your money on a room.","Chicago, Illinois","mrscraw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",13,3.0

All of the staff were extremely pleasant to deal with. It was about 1/2 a block from Times Square and a short walk to many other famous places to visit. We had 2 queen beds in our room that were very comfortable. We heard no noise from outside (although we brought a sound machine with us). Our room was on the second floor. Heard a door closing next door 2x but that was it. Very clean and no evidence of bugs. The bathroom was clean and had a big windowsill that doubled as an extra large shelf next to the sink. The water was hot when we wanted it to be. We were able to store our luggage before and after check in/check out and had our parking validated for a garage across the street for only $27 a day! The street never made me feel unsafe and there was a TGI Fridays next door (but MANY other places to choose from a short walk away). You have to keep in mind that unless you have a huge amount of money to spend, most rooms in NYC are small. I was pleasantly surprised by the space our room offered. Breakfast was ok but included with the room fee. Clean and spacious place to eat. Waffles and pancakes to heat up in the microwave, muffins, cereal, and great bagels.

Can't fault this hotel at all as it was everything that we needed and the check out time of 12pm was ok too as there is a luggage room with an attendant so all of your luggage remains safe while you explore the city.

They have friendly staff and the location is near Times Square. So what is the problem you say ? Well, the rate quoted for the room initially for a weeks' stay was from $ 124.99 to $ 224.99 per night and each day had a different rate. At first I thought that it might be because of the weekend but upon reflection the $ 124.99 and $ 224.99 both were on a Sunday so that ruled out the time of the week as a varying factor. The only thing that made sense was the expected occupancy factor. Since I made the reservation only a few days before arriving I was given a lower rate the first Sunday and a $ 100.00 more the second Sunday and each day in between a different rate.This practice I find very annoying and objectionable that I am paying a different rate each day for the same room and same amenities. I discovered the answer. I would call reservations every day to get a price quote for the remaining days of my stay and if it was a saving of $ 100.00 or more I would check out the next morning and then check back in - same room.On one occasion the front desk told me they could not check me back in because the hotel was full, to which I replied ""no"" I just checked out. They checked me back inAt times it is annoying to have to play this game but when the savings are substantial a tourist can well justify the process. If only the hotel would give a fair price up front for all the days a tourist is there then the feeling of being ripped off would go away.The last time I booked in for three days and I ended up checking out three times because of the large pricing fluctuation. Possibly if more travellers engaged in this process the hotel would reconsider their objectionable pricing structure and make it more palatable.","Toronto, Canada","KeymoSaabbee552</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",41,3.0

The bathroom was good size, with bathtub and hand held spray, but it was too short. Towels were thick and fluffy and changed daily. Liquid soap and shampoo, so if to do not like liquid, better bring a bar of soap. We requested a fridge and microwave which we had. Large flat screen TV with many channels including foreign. The lobby is clean and has seating area and 2 computers. The breakfast room is larger than normal and the selection of food was adequate to start your day, youghurt, breads, danish, eggs, cereals, coffee, and juices. 2 elevators and short wait time.

Upon arriving in the hotel, a member of staff greeted us and after asking if we wished to check in, helped us haul our bags up the steps to the hotel check in desk. We waited for a few minutes whilst another guest was being helped. The desk clerk was friendly and polite and made small talk with us whilst checking us in. We were inside our room within minutes and were pleasantly surprised how spacious it was as we'd read negative reviews about room sizes. Everything worked, the room was clean...look, we did the 'seasoned traveler' thing of peering upside down at the sink and the shower stall etc..and yes it wasn't 'brand new' looking, but it WAS clean and tidy and was cleaned every day whilst we were there. The hotel maids are polite and helpful too and replenished our coffee/tea etc daily too. I guess if you walk in like a hotel inspector then you can find fault if you keep looking for stuff but as a whole it was one of the cleanest hotels we've stayed in, and we've stayed in a heck of a lot of hotels. The breakfast room was open 24/7 and we wandered in at different times to grab a coffee or a free newspaper. It's a nice space to sit and relax if you don't want to be holed up in your room. The breakfast was okay too. Again we had seen some negative comments, but personally I feel this is harsh as the food offered (and there's plenty of it!) was of a very good standard. Again the staff on duty are helpful and polite. The free wifi never dropped out once in the week we stayed. The TV worked the whole time too. Only issue we had was our key which locked us out of our room one afternoon, but the cleaning lady and desk clerk sorted it between them and we were issued with fresh keys in minutes. Given the location, and having stayed at the hotel, I am even more amazed by the hotel, the price, the facilities, and the staff who helped us. They are a credit to the hotel and the company and helped us whenever called upon, right up to storing our bags safely for the day after we checked out. We used the free printing/internet on the computer in the lobby for printing our bus tickets to the airport, which was convenient for us. One other thing to note is that even though it is 2 minutes walk from times square, we had no issue with noise, either from the street or from other guests.

I simply called the hotel and spoke with them and they gladly matched the lower rate without hassle.  My flight was cancelled after we were already on board the plane. This was due to an aircraft sliding off the runway at a New York airport. The airports were closed and there was no way to get to New York to honor our reservations. I immediately called the hotel to cancel the reservation. I was transferred and could not find anybody that had ""access"" to my reservation. My reservation was always available when they changed me to a lower rate. I finally was given a number to the manager and I left her a message. She promptly returned my call, but advised me there was nothing they could do because charges are made through the computer and nobody there had a way to override this. They charged me for the first night even though the airports were closed. The amount I was charged was approximately $25 more than they told me it would be.

Although this is a chain, it's a small one...unknown to me at the time. I booked our room at a decent rate for the area,after doing some research to make sure it got fairly decent reviews. It started out very well with the quick, friendly, efficient check in. It only got better. Since our room was quite small...not a problem because we were only in the room to sleep at night, we asked the bellman, George, if we could have an extra luggage rack. It was in our room when we returned from our first trip out of the hotel. George was always friendly, upbeat, and helpful. Indeed an asset to the hotel. There is another bellman who is equally as efficient and friendly, and an asset. The breakfast are quite routine, but hey...it's in the hotel and we didn't have to go hunt someplace else to eat. The Houseman handles the breakfast room, keeping it stocked, cleaned, and ready for all who take advantage of the meal. Another asset to the hotel.Our room was always cleaned spotlessly when we returned from our days outing. I can only say good things about all those who work at this hotel. We asked for suggestions for a restaurant a couple of times...got great ideas, and used them! This place is definitely a gem for the otherwise busy, very expensive, Times Square area. We walked to GCT and to our Broadway shows. It's in a perfect spot. I should say that anywhere you stay in NYC, you might want to have ear plugs just in case the noise bothers you. It's a busy, noisy city...no matter where your room might be. I am generally a light sleeper, but with earplugs I slept like a baby in the comfy bed. I've been to the city a few times before, and always stayed in one of the big chains on Broadway, never again....even though I might have free nights available. This is just a great place to feel 'at home' while on vacation. You are like one of their family while you're here.

It's located less than a block away from Times Square and other sites. It is an incredible value for the money. This is a smaller hotel with only 79 rooms or so, so it's not too overwhelming. As others have said, it makes a great base to do some NYC exploring. The hotel is near both the Orange Line and the Yellow line metro, which is nice, but you may have to walk a little ways (or transfer) if those lines aren't where you're wanting to go.The room itself in the hotel was adequately sized, with a queen bed, nightstand, slim dresser and table. It was also very clean. Nothing was outdated. Even the bathroom had ample space for the shower, sink (single sink) and towels. They have dispensers for soap, lotion by the sink and for shampoo and bath soap in the shower. The water pressure wasn't as high as what I'm used to perhaps, but nothing horrible. Also, the bed was not as firm as I'm used to (it seemed a little to ""squishy"") for me, but I slept okay in the room. Since this is a small hotel, you should know that it has narrow hallways. (I was glad I only had a backpack with me because I'm certain that anything more than a small carry-on luggage size suitcase would be difficult to fit width-wise in the hallways). The staff at the hotel was very nice and offered directions to anywhere we needed to go. Also, they told us about their free business center where you can make print-outs of tickets or reservations if needed. They also have free Wi-fi that worked great.The included breakfast was just okay for me. They had a variety of foods (mini-muffins, bagels, bread, pastries, a few cereals, yogurt, fruit, pancakes & eggs) but the pancakes were cold and the eggs were a little on the runny side. But...you can't beat it for something quick to eat before beginning your day. I guess if you don't expect that much for breakfast, then you'll be happy with what you get. Lastly, don't expect a view from your room, as this hotel is tucked in among other buildings, and there are only 9 floors, so my view was an office building (I was there to sightsee, so the view from my room wasn't important overall).

There is a roof top bar at the back of the building and you can hear people talk and the music going to late into the night. Never really heard any noise from other rooms though, that is a plus. The only real complaint we had about our room was the damp musty smell. It hit you as soon as you walked into the room. You could see signs of moisture and mold in the bathroom. The window in the bedroom constantly had condensation on it. This definitely bothered my wife more then it did me. The water pressure was also terrible and our tub didn't drain well. I just chalked those up to being a really old building. I think 90% of this buildings/rooms problems could be fixed with new windows.

Needless to say I was very unhappy when we arrived at midnight (after travelling over 12 hours) only to be told there was no room for us and that they would pay for our cab to a pre-arranged Chelsea hotel (and they paid for a cab back the next morning).

We were on the 9th floor and never had a problem with waiting for the lift as some other reviews mentioned. Our room was a large king room with a spacious bathroom. We had a lot of luggage as we'd travelled from the UK and were then heading to Mexico but the room had a large storage cupboard which held our two large suitcases and backpacks as well as space to hang clothes. There was also a free to use safe in the room. The bed was huge and the room was very quiet considering how close to Times Square we were. The window in our room overlooked other buildings so we did not have a street view and I would imagine the rooms overlooking the street would have been much noisier. We didn't use the air con so can't comment on that.The reception was always staffed and they were very friendly and helpful.We had breakfast twice and it was OK, basic but served it's purpose when we had a couple of very early starts.I would recommend this hotel to family and friends and wouldn't hesitate to book here again.","Yorkshire Dales National Park, United Kingdom","SGPW</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yorkshire Dales National Park, United Kingdom</strong>",5,5.0

We were also advised to take a minibus to Newark Airport on our departure at a cost of $25 per person rather, than a taxi at $90 plus tolls.

But the hotel was excellent and let us change to a room at the back of the hotel. The breakfast is ok. It's very basic bit you could have a piece of toast, bagel, a yoghurt or fruit. The staff was very nice and polite. Always greeted us with a smile. I will definitely stay here again next time I visit New York.

It is a very crowded area, alive day and night, with lots of restaurants, shops and of course the theaters.The room was clean and comfortable, maybe a little bit small if you have a lot of luggage but good enough for a good night sleep after a long day.

We were arriving very late on the first day and leaving very early on the third so planned very little time at the hotel. The rate was about $300 per night including taxes. However, after arriving with our luggage (and walking past all the homeless people camped out for the night right outside the door), we were told there was an electrical problem with our room and they sent us to a sister hotel about a block away. Really? They had our phone number and could not have notified us of the change? The ""doorman"" didn't bother to open the door on our way in our out and just pointed down the street when we asked where we were going. After arriving at the Hotel@Times Square, we were told the rate was the same (even though I looked online at the time and the rate was significantly lower). The desk person said they couldn't change the rate given at a sister hotel and I could take it up with the manager. That policy makes no sense, especially since we'd booked a king room and ended up with a queen sized bed. Then they were going to send up back to the original hotel the 2nd night. I said we wouldn't move so we were given the room for 2 nights. Personally, I think that they sent us to the lower rate room so the higher rate room was available for last minute reservations. I will rate the Hotel@Times Square in a separate review. Both hotels have great locations, but are lacking other benefits. I think, with a little research, you can do better for your money. I rely on Tripadvisor reviews and do many of them myself......my research failed me on this one.","Green Bay, WI","KRGreenBay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Green Bay, WI</strong>",25,2.0

There was no mini fridge in our room.The complimentary breakfast was also good, with offerings of donuts, pastries, oats, fruits, yogurt, eggs, tea/coffee etc. There is also a microwave here which was a bonus so we could heat up any leftover takeaway.If you're after yummy Chinese food, give John's Shanghai across the road a go.

The doors slam and there was someone in the room next to me that kept going in and out about 10 times in the mornings and afternoons slamming the doors which was really annoying. The rooms are good size and had everything i needed. The shower ran cold though after only a couple of minutes so have to be quick. Having a room at the back was great for the winter as window is a view of a wall, i didnt open the windows so dont know if this will be good in summer when you would want fresh air. There isnt a fridge so i kept my drinks on the window sill with the curtain closed it kept my water very cold.I only had my room cleaned twice as travelling along and dont require services everyday, i put the private sign on the door and on two occassion housekeeping rang to see if i required cleaning, this both happened whilst having afternoon nap and on one occassion rang twice and then knocked on door which annoyed me as woke me up. Room was great size for one person bed kingsize but quite soft and pillows too soft for my personal liking.I only had breakfast one one occasion which was good and also like you can have tea and coffee during the day as and when you want.I kept myself to myself so didnt really ask reception for anything but they were polite when checking in and out.

We stayed in the hotel all afternoon and occasionally went down to the road which was cut off.

The closet safe held my laptop and the bathroom was a reasonable size. Everything was crisp and clean. With the A/C and the white noise machine we weren't at all bothered by the street noise...until 4 am. That was when the garbage was picked up, by multiple companies we came to learn. Apparently owners contract nightly garbage collection. There was no sleeping through that metal on metal noise. It didn't ruin our trip and I can't say I wasn't warned but I would recommend taking a room elsewhere. I am sure the second floor was worse than other floors as well but we did enjoy the quick access with the stairs.Staff were all fabulously friendly and helpful.

The interior design is slightly outdated so the room did not look modern but it didn’t distract much. The bathroom was sufficient with a decent sized tub and good quality soap, shampoo and lotion.The breakfast was not exciting. There was no cooked food at all but the bread was fresh and well tasting. Fruit was in good supply. The guy working in the kitchen was working hard to keep supply. Another person who deserves a mention is the very friendly porter who was always greeting guests and was helpful at all times.There are two Apple computers with a laser printer which was quite useful since many people print out tickets etc. Just remember that any document that you download on these computers remain in the computer even after log off.Overall this is an affordable hotel by New York standards and right in the middle of the action.

It wasn't ideal, but I rolled with it. (2) The other negative -- the hotel really didn't offer any consolation for my inconvenience. I didn't ask, but they should have offered something. Positives: Value - much cheaper than the Marriott Marquis and the Renaissance which are right in Times Square. The Broadway hotel is just a half block off of Times Square but much less expensive. And it's a nice and clean hotel. Modern and updated but not over the top. Nice furniture in the lobby, breakfast area, and rooms. The size of my room was average, but good. A little smaller than the rooms at the hotels mentioned above, but def. larger rooms that at the Night Hotel. The free breakfast was very good for my taste--It wasn't a hot breakfast, but they had bagels, toaster, cereal, hard-boiled eggs, and fresh apples and bananas. Wi-fi was free and worked fine.

First of all, do not be turned off by the small size of the hotel. Yes compared to some of the chains in Times Square it is small, but it really makes up for the size in charm and cleanliness. The staff is accomodating and helpful and you really cant beat the location. Half a block from Broadway, how can you not like that?! I was also quite pleasantly surprised by how fast the wifi was here. Faster than in some of the larger chains hotels in the area. Yes you will say that a smaller hotel will have fewer people and fewer people hitting the network, but i have stayed at another boutique hotel closer to Central Park and the wifi there was abysmal. Here it was like i was back at my home network, easily able to send a ton of emails and stream vids if i wanted too. The room was a tad larger than i had anticipated which made me that much happier. I asked for a room overlooking 46th and i got two windows, small ones, but it was still nice. The corridors are small and there is only one elevator. The key here is to ask for a lower floor room and just take the stairs. It is better for you anyway. Breakfast was what I thought it would be, no omlet stations or anything like that, but a reasonable amount of choices. There was some door slamming by other residents, but this cant be avoided anywhere you go. I did have some issues with the Lodgenet movie services, but the staff did refund the movies that did not work back to me. Bottom line, if you dont want to spend upwards of 400+ in a room you will only be sleeping in, then this is a nice choice for you. Might be a bit small for a family of four, but for a couple getting away, perfect!","Baltimore, Maryland","John W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Baltimore, Maryland</strong>",13,5.0

The location is something which cannot be beaten doe the price and this is what sold the hotel to me, along with the plethora of good reviews, thanks for trip advisor reviewers. The hotel itself is good, its clean and comfortable and offers a lot of plusses included in the price, Free WiFi, Free breakfast and which as much as people complained about it, is free and is just toast, bagels, doughnuts cereal and coffee and juice so it does offer a lot for very little. Price wise as I've said, it cannot be beaten for location and comfort. We were offered room 901 and while this was a great room, the problem we found was the elevator, the staff seem to use it a lot to move cleaning carts from floor to floor and they can obviously override call up, so this means a few times the lift came up to floor 7, then went straight down, so my advise to any of you would be to ask for a lower floor and like other reviewers have said, ask for a location at the back, it does get a little noisy. When we first arrived the lobby was covered in dust sheets and there were workers hammering and sawing and there was an overwhelming smell of pain thinners and dust, this was a bit of a let down, but on a positive note the breakfast room is complete and I have attached a photo.

I depend on reviews from fellow travelers when booking new travel. The reviews for the most part were good so I took the plunge. When we arrived last Saturday.....it had been raining and we walked from Penn Station to the hotel....looking like drowned rats! We walked into the lobby and it was completely torn up under construction, temporary desk....looked rather shady. I became very concerned but the staff was very warm and welcoming, stating that the breakfast area had already been completed and they were renovating the lobby. We checked in and went up to our room. It is typical New York, small halls and tight on space, but the room was wonderful! King sized bed, full bathroom. Very Very Clean! All nicely decorated. True the view wasn't wonderful, looked at a wall and other windows, but hey this is New York City! It's a concerete jungle.....if you want a hotel view, go to the beach! For the price it is amazing! Full breakfast every morning including pastries, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt.....you just can't get any better. We came to New York a couple of years ago and were lucky enough to stay in the Mariott Times Square.....of course it was fancier....but we didn't get breakfast and paid significantly more for the room. If you are on a budget, don't hesitate - stay here! You are half a block off of the main portion of Times Square - great value and location. A couple of pubs across the street - got the Irish and Scottish covered! And you can just walk back across the street. In short, very nice hotel, great value, and welcoming staff.

I knew NY was expensive, and coming from Australia where everything is expensive, I thought I wouldn't get any wallet shock from hotel rates. This was our first trip to NY, and since we only had 3 nights and 2 days to spend here, we wanted to stay in a hotel that was close to a lot of things but won't break the bank. Broadway at Times Square was just that - average hotel at a perfect location. The location didn't disappoint us - it was about a 1-2 minute walk to Times Square. The hotel itself was average - very small lobby, breakfast room and bedroom. But for the price we paid ($290/night for 3 adults and 1 kid, vs $450++ for other hotels in the same area), this was a good deal. Breakfast was also included in the price - buffet selection which had waffles, fruit danish bread, sausage, bagels, loaf bread, yogurt, fruits, fried eggs and unlimited coffee for the whole day. It was an average selection and quality was so-so, but still a great plus for the price we paid.The room itself had two double beds, and a reasonable sized bathroom. The room was quite small, there was about 0.25m distance between the beds and the walls, and about 1m distance between the two beds. It was quite a challenge fitting all our luggages and ourselves in the room. I would have preferred a bigger room, but again, we weren't really there to lounge around in the room. The room came with free wifi and cable tv.The concierge was very helpful, he gave us maps and was able to book us on the hop in hop off Greyhound tour. He also booked us for our trip to JFK, which was about an hour trip from the hotel.

We finally asked her who she was as she had given no clue and were informed that she was the manager.

There was some problem with how it is adjusted, since there are no thermostats for individual rooms. We actually turned on the window unit AC to cool off.

Oh, and when the deak tells you that the parking garage (a GREAT discount) is right across the street, don't believe them. It is half a block before you get to the hotel.

We were very happy with our stay. For anyone looking for glitz or glamour, or spacious rooms suitable for a group, this is NOT your place. It is a small, clean, comfortable place that feels like a little European hostelry, with its small lobby and tiny lift. You stay here for the friendliness, the cleanliness, and the convenience, and brag about getting a very reasonable deal, not about staying in a la-di-da accommmodation!Staff at reception were very friendly. When we called late at night to ask for extra pillows, a member of staff arrived within minutes!Our room at the back of the hotel was very quiet and we were happy about that. And I cannot begin to tell you how well organized it was. In order to fit a king bed into a small space, someone went to a lot of trouble to figure out how to arrange the furniture. The console under the television is more than adequate for a couple medium- to large-sized pieces of luggage, and the drawers are deep and held all our clothes. There is a desk and there is a small closet. The bathroom has a low, deep sill and you could sit down on it if you needed to, or store toiletries on it. The only suggestion I might make is that there be an additional towel bar, as we couldn't easily hang up our damp towels unless we slung them over the shower rod, which only puts them in the way of your travel partner when he/she is ready to take a shower. If you have some sort of over-the-door hook or hanging clip you can stash in your suitcase, pending the installation of extra towel bars, that might do the trick.Please note that if you are traveling with someone else, and one of you might need to go into the bathroom and turn on the light while the other is sleeping, you should be aware that the bathroom door has a long frosted/reeded glass insert, and the bathroom light will shine through it. This could bother a light sleeper. I love the glass, but was glad I had my sleep mask with me.As to the water temperature - you might have to run the water for awhile but it will get hot.Breakfast was fine; personally I would like to have some more healthful selections, such as plain yogurt, rather than the sweet/fruity type; and some unsweetened cereal choices; but I realize my preferences might not be shared by most guests.

This was the first trip that I planned from start to finish (my husband usually handles the trip planning) and I wanted to make sure everything ran smoothly. I read through dozens of reviews on Trip Advisor and received a lot of useful information that helped with my decision. I read many horror stories about travelers reserving rooms with various hotel chains through third party sites only to find that their reservation was lost or the hotel was overbooked after arriving at the hotel. With that in mind, I reserved my room by calling the hotel's reservations line instead of booking my stay online. The reservationist was very helpful, answered all of my questions and immediately sent the confirmation email to me. They told me to bring my AAA card for a 5% discount and to call the day before checkin if I wanted to request a particular room. The week before my trip, they sent another confirmation/reminder email of the date of my check in.The day before my trip, I called to request a room facing 46th Street and they handled it without a problem. Checkin went smoothly the following day and the hotel honored the AAA discount. Once we entered our room, I followed the advice of other reviewers and immediately checked the room for signs of bed bugs. I didn't find any. The room was clean, cozy and perfect for my son and me. The bed was comfortable and my son and I slept very well every night.The staff was friendly and made us feel welcome. Breakfast is served from 6:30 until 10:30 am and there was always lots of food. The hotel offered cereal, waffles, eggs, sausage, danishes, doughnuts, yogurt, bread for toasting and fruit. They also offered tea, coffee, apple and orange juice. There was more than enough food to fill our bellies so I was very pleased. The hotel is located half a block from Times Square and is within walking distance from the Theatre District, Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center. At night we did notice that there were a few homeless people sleeping on the steps of the church next door to the hotel. This might bother some travelers but we always felt safe in the area, even at night. Whenever we entered the hotel, the staff greeted us with smiles.

We found it to be a bit rude, but proceeded to pay and then went up to our rooms.We now knew why....The extremely small & stuffy room but was clean (which was at least ONE good thing about this hotel). We then decided to unpack and go to bed. Our heating started spitting out gas or something so we called up Maintenance. He 'fixed' the problem and went away. It didnt stop for the next 2 hours. It was SO loud so we called them up AGAIN. We tried to ask the maintenance man what was going on, but he couldn't speak English, so they just moved us to another room.The breakfast was cereals, stale doughnuts and juice - I wouldn't bother eating there at all. Go across the street to the cafe deli shop which is open 24 hours.The rooms have paper thin walls, and can hear everything next door. When next door opened their door, our door shook and sounded like someone was trying to come into our room. I even heard someone going to the bathroom one night!!!One morning we were heading down stairs to go out and put the 'do not disturb' sign on our door. We ran into the maid on the way out, and she asked if we wanted our room serviced. We said no thank you and went out. When we got downstairs I forgot something in my room and my partner went up stairs to get it... He finds the maid at our door with it open?!?!?! I found that disgusting & very rude. Glad he got up there when he did in case she stole anything.The days we didnt get our room serviced, the maids got VERY angry and rude. They were very pushy. I know that is their job, but Im not letting people in my room who I don't trust.One day she asked if we we're leaving and then started cheering in the elevator. She was SO rude!!!The LIFT/ELEVATOR - slowest lift in NYC. There were broken tiles which my sister tripped on. And you would think that it would have a sensor if someone was getting in, the door wouldn't close on them? I started to walk into the elevator and instead of opening back up, it rushed towards me and closed, and have a terrible bruise on my leg.The staff are very rude and unprofessional, and not friendly at ALL.On the last day that we were here, we found out they charged us an extra $5000 on our card, on top of what we already paid!!!!!!!! They said the computer automatically charged it and would try and fix it soon. How many other people has this happened too????The ONE thing I liked about this hotel was the location, but PLEASE pay a little bit extra and go somewhere nice and professional.I was so excited to stay here from the great reviews, but NEVER, EVER EVER AGAIN.We have been extremely disappointed with our stay in NYC and cannot wait to go home.","Brisbane, Australia","Lauren C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",74,1.0

It definitely filled us up. It was great having that to start us off each morning. Tea and coffee were available all day long, so when we had come back from our adventures we could easily pick up a hot drink without having to buy one from a store. There was always a man standing in the lobby greeting everyone who walked in and helping them if they needed it.Our only concern while we were there was the elevator. It has a limit of five people at one time and as there was four of us there could only be room for one more person each time we used it. One day we were on our way to the lobby and two other people got in and then it the doors closed and it got stuck half way down. We only had to wait for about three minutes before one of the staff opened the door for us. They do have one sign stating that there is a limit of five people but if the elevator is full no one can see it because it isn't that big. My only suggestion would be is to put a bigger sign on the outside of each level so people can read it before they enter.
