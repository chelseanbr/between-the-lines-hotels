Yes, the room was small, but adequate and well equipped. The shower was good. Great views from top of hotel and probably from many rooms.Some staff were indifferent, some were very friendly, no different to all walks of life. The restaurant was a little lacking, it was very quiet, therefore lacking atmosphere and the staff were maybe not very well trained, constantly looking to see if we had finished eating, waiting to clear! The décor was interesting, it was a little expensive for what was available, but the food was tasty.

The room is nice but quite smallbut it's OK as we are in Manhattan. Well located hotel. Noce bathroom but with shower only. 36th floor, beautiful view. 3 fairly fast elevators.Several problems:1. There was an air leak around the bedroom door which produces a hissing sound that can be heard very well. The second night, this hissing woke me up and kept me awake for part of the night. 2. Surprise, they charge $30 per day for coffee in the room, 2 bottles of 330ml of water per day, access to the Business Center (included elsewhere when available), to the Cycling studio (included where available), 3 tokens 20% discount at the restaurant and 10% on certain items on sale. Most people do not use these services. It ends up to $15 a bottle of water a day. Almost theft...3. Saturday evening, party on the 40th floor. From my room I hear the percussion of the music and the people screaming. Luckyly, the music stoppes short after 11:00 PM4. That Saturday evening, for the party, an elevator was reserved. Long delays for other customers who only have 2 elevators left.5. I Don't know what fabric is used for the top sheet of the bed but it was FULL of static electricity! Each time I was touching it I was having an electricity chock. I had to remove it from the bed.6. With my reservation, I received a coupon for a special gift (not knowing what it was). I showed it at the registration desk and they said they will took care of that.

After an international flight!! So we waited until 4om out of principle, the girl on check in was not friendly, that's when we found out about the ""destination fee"" 34 dollars per night plus 150 deposit! This was not something I had budgeted for on my trip! She didn't explain what it was for? Explain what floor we are on, that there was a gym, nothing.The room was nice and clean but as other reviews say it was small, this is is OK for 2 people but not with 4 big suitcases, can't be stored under the bed.The bed was big but mattress dipped down in the middle so was slanted, needs to be replaced. I felt the room constantly cold even with the heating system on, there was a very cold draft coming in the window, could only leave heat on for a short time as it was dry air and in a small room it just stung my eyes after 20 mins.Housekeeping were great our room was serviced everyday!The roof top bar has beautiful views but is expensive at 17-18 dollars a drink, plus tax and tip. Not part of the hotel so you need to reserve with staff in the lobby beside the lift. Good location about 8 min walk into centre but quite area so didn't have much noise at night, didnt see any dangerous characters around hotel which was mentioned in other reviews. Felt safe.

The location is fab. We used the airtrain/tube to get into the city and walked out to find the hotel just at the side of the tube station. The central location is great for exploring the city and is just off Times Square. This does mean it is busy and that there are homeless people close by as other reviews have commented but this is true of many places in this location and we did not feel unsafe at any point. The rooms are small but are very clean and have everything you need. The bed is large and was the most comfortable I have ever slept in!! The hotel staff were very helpful and polite. The rooftop bar has brilliant views of the Empire State and the city generally. The destination tax is high but I guess not down to the hotel itself. We were given tokens for 20% off food and drinks but they could not be used at the rooftop bar which I think they should be. However, I could not really fault the hotel overall. The rooms could be bigger but the size is understandable when considering the location. Would recommend. If you are not staying here then definitely give the bar a visit.

We normally stay at another PHR hotel but it was booked. The location was surprisingly convenient to most mid-town spots. The proximity to the Port Authority Bus Terminal may turn some people away, but it wasn't an issue.Interestingly - there are only 8 rooms per floor, so you get a sense that this is a smaller (boutique) hotel. But this is a tall hotel and you'll wait several passes for space on an elevator during peak times. Rooms - Typical NYC size (small), but very cleverly laid out. Great use of mirrors to make the room appear larger. Good storage, power outlets/USB, and lighting.The ""roof top"" bar is nice. Good drinks, great views.The ""fitness center"" is only good if you want to do virtual spin class, so make sure you pack gear so you can take advantage of one of the resort fee services.Staff was generally very helpful, but the Front desk seemed a little moody.

Good location. Good coffee pods/coffee maker in the room. They had a room for early check-in well before 4pm. Room was quiet.Now for the disappointments. The biggest is the mattress in my room was well overdue for replacing. I was at this hotel for 6 nights and I did not sleep well. You know those indentations on beds, where the mattress needs to be turned or flipped or replaced. On the second day, I mentioned this to the front desk. They said they’d report it. But nothing was done to improve the situation and I mentioned it again when I checked out. The response was, “we have in our notes we reported it.” The bedding in the room was ok, not luxurious. The comforter was thin. No blankets. So, you may have to run the room warmer than you might otherwise choose to do so, When I checked into my room, the thermostat and heater was not working. It would only blow cold. I had to call for engineering staff to come fix it. They actually disconnected the thermostat and asked me to manually operate the radiator during my stay. On the first night they did not clean the room. Be careful that the wall switch for “do not disturb” is left on by a prior guest. This is what happened to me. When I asked for refreshed coffee from the front desk they gave me a couple of pods, I didn’t know until the next morning, they’d given me decaf. When I returned to the front desk, I was told they didn’t have regular coffee replacement pods, only decaf at the front desk. Huh? I waited and waited and they couldn’t find their runner to bring some to the desk. I told them to forget doing it, but soon while I was getting ready for work, they knocked on my door to deliver some coffee pods. Amenities in the bathroom are ok, a bit too scented. No shower caps provided. They don’t provide complimentary water, but there was water available with a $8 per bottle cost attached. Go to Duane Reade and buy a gallon for $2.00. The bathroom is fine. However the shower is the type where half the wall is glass, so you need to reach in to turn on the water. Make sure the shower head is pointed to the wall (every morning) because you will get snow with cold water...and if you’re in you Pajamas you’ll be annoyed they got all wet. This is what happened when I went to take my first shower there. If you travel a lot, you are familiar with these small spaces and the solid wall barriers that don’t easily allow you to access knobs etc. I travel a lot. And I love trying out new hotels. I had read good things about Aliz and was looking forward to trying it. This was one of my most disappointing hotel stays in NY I have experienced. (And when I checked in, I told them I was an avid trip advisor reviewer.) The biggest deal was the bad mattress. That is unacceptable.","Los Angeles, California","OBD2142</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",303,2.0

The hotel lobby is small nice with modern furnishings. it was too small for the traffic of guest coming in and out,with only 2 attendants. The 3 elevators are small and you have to wait a long while to get on. If you are going on an off busy weekday or weekend it may be more accommodating. The rooms and bathroom are small for a family of 4 but very nice clean modern.I think for 2 people it’s perfect. The beds were double beds, too small for 2 adults. Not very comfortable.

It’s very close to Times Sq, but the location opposite to Port Authority Bus Terminal is not necessarily the nicest area, especially at night. No complimentary water is provided on the room, and coffee capsules and bath amenities were not provided sufficiently (some days, was just forgotten to refill). Checkout times are bit ridiculous: you can only CheckIn at 4pm but have to leave already at 11am. Market standard in NY is 3pm CheckIn and 12am checkout. Don’t know why they take their right to cut your stay by 2 hours.But overall, I am shocked by the lack of customer service and unfriendliness of front desk staff in this hotel. I can absolutely not understand previous reviews which praised the friendliness...One night, a hotel staff was painting the walls on my floor right in front of my room. I gently asked at 9:45pm (evening!!) to stop it, but the staff just responded he cannot stop without his management approval. So, I called front desk to inform them about and they said they will take care. As you can imagine, nothing happened. I briefly feel asleep but the ongoing noise woke me up again at 1am in the middle of the night. I complained with the staff about the situation and asked to immediately stop it. Another call at front desk, another time they promised to take care. I was really close to calling the police, and at around 1:45am, the work finally ended. Next morning, I approached front desk and asked for some kind of compensation (ie deduction of this single night from the final bill). Nothing, not even a „sorry for that“. I sent a formal complaint email to the hotel management which was not even responded to. Either front desk staff did not forward to management to avoid raising awareness of this, or even worse, management received and just did not react.This is completely unacceptable and I already told my company to stop supposing this hotel for future business travels. This hotel is really giving nothing about its customers. Finally, even after all above, a real late checkout was not granted. They generously offered 12:30 whereas other hotels would easily give you 2/3pm. As they absolutely don’t take care, at the day of checkout, housekeeping knocked at the door at 9am and then again at 12am to clean the room. This again shows how careless they are.What also annoys is that the three customer lifts are regularly used by housekeeping staff with their trolleys which often makes your lift journey an endless one. Don’t know why they don’t have a separate housekeeping and staff elevator, this would ease the lift situation.","Frankfurt, Germany","Hoschbert79</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Frankfurt, Germany</strong>",98,1.0

This is by far the smallest room we have ever encountered anywhere we have been in the world, let alone New York. The closet is a small cupboard which also houses the coffee making machine and does not have enough room to hang anything more than 6-7 items WITHOUT jackets or coats etc. I had to hang most of my clothes on anything that would take a hanger in the bedroom or bathroom.When I complained, we were moved to a disability room which we were told was larger. The only difference was, you could walk around the bed without tripping over your suitcase. The bathroom was larger but there was absolutely nowhere to put your toiletries. No shelves, nothing. Not even a glass to place our toothbrushes so that and everything else had to be placed on the floor which was disgusting. I have never experienced anything like this in a hotel in my life!Although the receptionist was really lovely when I complained, she said that one of the hotels main selling points is it’s location to Times Square. This I don’t understand because like someone else has mentioned in a previous review, it’s a good 12 minutes walk to Times Square plus the street it’s on is horrible.

I did my reservation via Priceline and there was nothing in my reservation that warned me about this fee, so it gives you a feeling when you are checking in that your stay in NYC is not starting very well, but other than this issue, the hotel is great and our stay in NYC was the best.","Pomona, California","cctrimsusa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pomona, California</strong>",0,4.0

Check-in experience was bad, arrived early to see if I could check-in but was told to come back at 4pm. Came back at 4pm, and was told to wait as the room was still not ready. This was a sign of things to come. 4:20pm was told the room was finally ready. Went to the room to find the room reeking of cheap cologne, smelled like teenagers using too much Axe body spray after gym class. Also, the room was obviously not used in a while as the tv was unplugged and the remote not working. Noise from the rooftop and adjoining room made the window and walls shake. I could clearly hear the television's dialog through the walls. Went down to reception to see if we could change rooms, was told they couldn't, during my conversation with reception, the security bumped their shoulder into me and walked without saying a word. I commented to reception about the rudeness, was given a lame excuse by security about tripping on their own feet. Another incident with the security happened the next morning during check out as they stepped on my feet and knocked into me again, again not excusing themselves. No manners at all. Here is the final straw, found out that they double charged for the room, once during check-in and again at check-out.

Despite an email indicating we had paid in full we were greeted with a ‘Destination Fee’ of nearly $35 a day. This I was assured, was for bottled water in the rooms (small bottles only, the larger ones are charged at $8 each), coffee & tea!?! I was intrigued - having been in the US for the past two weeks & received complimentary tea, coffee & bottled water everywhere, was annoyed to say the least. In fact in over 40 years of staying in hotels was not accustomed to being charged - these are included in the price. I questioned this issue with reception staff and was informed this fee also entitled us to 20% off in the restaurant for breakfast or evening meal - really!?! So we are charged nearly $35 a day, only to receive a proportion back if we eat in the hotel. Not really very convincing - just fleecing your customers!We found the staff courteous, polite and helpful throughout albeit I note other reviews are not so complimentary.

There was constant noise, screaming and smoking coming from the hallway outside our tiny room, we called the lobby several times to inform them, but nothing was done to address this issue. The noise and smoke went on from 11 pm to 4 am, and we had the worst night with no sleep. The next day they moved us to another tiny room, and then we realized that housekeeping doesn't do housekeeping. They do not replenish toilet paper or soap, and even when you request housekeeping, all they do is make the bed. We asked for housekeeping one morning and came back to the room and realized they didn't clean the room, and when I called the lobby, they said housekeeping ""had left for the day."" We were here on business and to celebrate our anniversary and were hoping for a great experience, but sadly ended being one of the worst hotels ever. We would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Also, watch out for the sneaky resort fee they do not inform you about until after you book your room.

Our room was on 12th floor at the front of the hotel. The room was modern, clean, comfortable beds, a good New York skyline view and we were happy with the space to store our 3 suitcases. Space to unpack/hang our clothes was very limited, especially for 3 people but that would be our only complaint about our room.As mentioned by other reviews, there are undesirable people about the street outside the hotel but we noticed they were not there from Friday evening until Sunday evening so maybe it is because the department of correction is next door and perhaps doesn't operate during the weekend. As the hotel was only about 50 steps from 8th Ave, we did not feel threatened and there were always plenty other tourist/pedestrians around when we were arriving/departing the hotel.Location was great, subway at the corner of the street and port authority across the street (with escalators/lifts for travelling with suitcases) for our direct ""E line"" train to connect to air train back to JFK. We walked to many of the tourist spots from the hotel but also used the subway lots as we had our $32 unlimited subway ticket and it was so close to the hotel. We were told on check in about the rooftop bar but also advise our son could only visit between 2-4pm due to his age, which we did and took lots of great pictures of New York. We did not use the restaurant as there are so many food choices nearby. The only minor issues we encountered were:1. Reception staff NEVER smiled, they were polite but not especially welcoming on checked in/out or anytime we asked for info/assistance. 2. The lifts were INCREDIBLY busy around 11am on both days we were heading out at that time, waiting ages for them to stop at our floor and then they were already full. Based on this experience, on check out day, we headed for the lifts around 10.30, had no waiting time, plenty space in the lift and there were bellboys already waiting in the lobby to tag and store any luggage from guests checking out. (Thank you gents, your luggage storage and collection processes were excellent).3. We noticed the hotel has now introduced a resort tax of approx $34 per day, fortunately this did not affect us, but other guests who perhaps booked before this was introduced may not be aware they may have this additional cost to pay.A great choice of hotel, although we may choose to stay slightly further from Times Square/8th Ave on any future trips due to the non-stop traffic noise and the volume of pedestrians in this central area.",,Lesley F,0,5.0

Other than maybe two employees one of them being Zach many of the employees were standoffish and seemed irritated when you asked questions or asked for assistance. At check in we were required to pay the security deposit as well as the $30 per day ""resort fee"". I am sorry but paying that much per day for a 20% food credit that you were not allowed to use at breakfast and a couple of small bottles of water each day was not in my opinion worth the fee. I also not once saw anyone in the cycle room (which we also pay for). The lobby although very nice is very tiny and often extremely crowded. We would have liked to sit at the lobby bar and have a drink during happy hour however with the large number of guests that were checking in during those times it was not a place where you could even sit and enjoy a glass of wine.Our room was located on the 38th floor with amazing views however if you were on a lower floor your view would have consisted of a brick wall. The room although small was lovely, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was small but bright and well laid out. The coffee maker in the closet was a bit awkward to use and a few of the days the regular coffee was not replaced. In regards to location it was well situated for walking to almost anything, however I do agree with some of the other reviews that it was somewhat unnerving to walk past the filth and individuals living and sleeping directly outside ( I had my daughter with me). I believe that this hotel has a great deal of potential but needs to work on teaching its young staff better customer service skills.

We never felt safe leaving or arriving back at the hotel so we always crossed the road.We paid for the room in full when we arrived but they still took $150 US dollars as a security deposit. They then keep on taking money out of our account even though we had paid for the room in full. When confronted about it they were so rude, kept on passing it on to another staff member and then the manager finally came out she said she would investigate. The next day she finally got back to us and said the extra money that keeps getting taking out is more security deposits as they were scared we were going to run off ? This was an insult ! Considering everything had been paid for. The staff there are completely rude ! The worst customer service I have ever experienced! They don’t greet you, they just say “what do you want” . Then the roll their eyes at you, huff and puff . The motel in itself is tiny. The lobby is set out really bad. There’s a bar in the lobby which takes up a lot of room. They only have 3 really slow lifts for the whole building which is 40 levels. There is always a line up to go up and down the elevator. There is a bar on the top of the building , amazing views but we went up their and was told we can’t be here , I found this rude and weird considering we are staying in the building. The room we had was so so small. There is no room to put your suitcases. It was so dirty. The aircon is on the floor beside the bed and is extremely loud and on the other side of the bed you literally roll into the bath room. We had a balcony which was ok. The door to go outside to the balcony didn’t lock . We told the front desk as they reckon they fixed it but it was still broken.

I figured that any kinks should be ironed out by the time our stay came around. I got what turned out to be a fantastic deal as we had a great stay at the end of June/beginning of July. We arrived quite late in the evening and were warmly welcomed by [Max?] on reception. He allocated us a 'double' room on the 37th floor. The size of the room was perfect for two and, I believe, quite spacious for New York standards. It contained two double beds and had a great view of Hudson Yards and the Empire State Building. I loved waking up to that view - we caught an amazing sunrise one morning. The bathroom was also a good size with a very powerful rainfall shower and complementary luxury Beekman toiletries.We didn't eat at the hotel, but we did go up to the rooftop bar, Dear Irving on Hudson, for drinks one evening. The views from up there are amazing and the bar has such a nice vibe. I would say it was quite reasonably priced all things considered. All in all, we had a faultless stay at the Aliz and would 100% stay there again. Don't be put off by the reviews which mention homeless/drunk people outside the hotel - yes, they are there (and in many other parts of the city), but not one of them approached us or bothered us during our stay.

The location of the hotel is great! On 8th Avenue, across from the Time Square! Near metro station, convenience store / pharmacy, pub. Nearby you can find parking. The check-inn was with problem because the employee could not make a charge of $ 150 on a credit card. I received the wrong room.. But as a compliment, I got a free breakfast.The size of the room is small. The benefits - There was a modern coffee machine in the room and a large bathroom. Breakfast buffet was not bad. But the main advantage of this hotel is the location. It's impossible to get lost. From the hotel it is easy to go to the Central Park, to the Plaza Hotel, explore the upper and lower Manhattan. And also find and see the apartment of Carrie Bradshaw, lol) You can also confidently go to the embankment to the Hudson River.. The rooms are not for the family, but for the traveler. In Philadelphia, I had a huge room with a kitchen - this is more suitable for a family. The room is quite modern, with a comfortable bed and a well-equipped bathroom.",,AnetteG1403,0,3.0

One staff member spent 20 minutes flirting with someone off in a corner and yes I timed it, nothing else to do in a blackout. They were great other than that. There was no apology or sympathy displayed and no one even offered water to the customers until an hour after the blackout started and someone had to ask, you know for the free water we get in our rooms.

Reception helped us sort out our deferred helicopter flights, arranged taxis and provide helpful travel advise. 10 out of 10 to the staff.We had two rooms which were surprisingly quiet on this side of the hotel. They were adequately sized with adequate storage space for a boutique hotel, in this location during summer months. The beds were very comfortable. The rooms were cleaned well each day and topped up with complimentary water bottles. On one occasion they forgot the water. We advised the desk, received extra water and received a personalised note of apology from the cleaners.

In reality it is just another run of the mill hotel. Most of first floor consumed by restaurant that is usually empty. Had tiny little 4 seat bar in tiny reception area. There is another bar higher up with a nice view though. Extremely small room even by New York standards. If you walk out of bathroom too quickly you'll fall into the bed. Roughly 1ft of clearance between bed and sliding bathroom door which by the way has to be a slider because there isn't enough space for a normal door to open or close. Check in and out were extremely slow. Girl at front desk couldnt even manage to ask how our stay was at check out. 1st day housekeeping forgot to re-supply coffee in room. Went to front desk to get some but they didn't have any. Off on coffee quest at 5am when it was supposed to have been provided free. Saw another review that mentioned this. Starting to think it's a cost cutting measure. By the way, the coffee maker is in the little tiny closet lol. Second day housekeeping didn't refill the empty tissue holder. This wasn't a big deal but it really is housekeeping 101. Half of what should be a window in room was blocked off with a mirror. Probably to make room look bigger. Could not see the view unless you stood directly in front of the half window. Location is directly across from port authority bus terminal. Not the best area. Many bums and panhandlers.

Great restaurants (Bea and Boqueria) and Time Square and other sites within easy walking distance, and easy access to the Museum of Natural History, The Bronx Zoo, Chinatown...via the subway. The hallways in the hotel are small and it seemed likes the noise of people talking could be heard more loudly than in hotels that are larger. But, I wouldn't let that stop me from coming back. Additionally, the rooms are just big enough to be comfortable and everything is clean and new. Great food in the Farm to Burger restaurant was an added plus; especially on a morning where we didn't want to walk in the rain to go out for breakfast; as well as for an awesome burger and mac n cheese that hit the spot after a long day out and about.

We both had to live out of the suitcase as there was nowhere to put anything which meant lifting the heavy bags up off the floor everyday.

Took the train up from DC for a 1:30pm mtg, which concluded just after 5p. I made sure to grab a snack bar and a bottled water as I left my mtg so I wouldn’t have to stop at a Duane Reade along the way. I checked into the hotel after my meeting sometime after 5:30p. I picked the Aliz because I found a good rate last minute online, and it was walking distance from my meeting, Times Square and the train station. It was a typically small room, but was clean, modern and had good use of space. It was right next to the Port Authority (view from my window overlooked it). I decided to try my luck with last min show tickets and scored great seats to Dear Evan Hansen. After the show, I stopped in Hudson’s at the Port Authority and bought some OJ and some cranberry juice. For those keeping track that’s now 3 beverages I brought to my room. I checked out before 10am the next morning and walked to Penn Station to catch my train back home. Imagine my surprise a week later when completing my expense report and finding a mysterious additional charge of $8.71 on my card. When I inquired with the hotel I was told it was for taking a bottled water from the room refrigerator per information provided by housekeeping. I explained that housekeeping must’ve confused me with another guest room as I had NOT taken anything from the fridge because I had my own water and juice that I brought with me and was in the room for less than an hour before I went to the show, and brought juice with me on the way back!Despite 3 emails over the course of the month I never received a refund of the $8.71. While the amount is small, it’s the principle of the matter. And it’s a deceptive business practice to erroneously charge guests for something they didn’t consume/use. Imagine how much money they’re making by doing this to unsuspecting guests who they wager will not notice or not bother to dispute it. I had been excited to have found a cool new hotel as I travel to NYC frequently, but I will stay elsewhere (as I did this past weekend when I visited for 3 days) and I’ll avoid the Aliz because I don’t trust them and their management was unresponsive. If you decide to stay there BE WARNED of this deceitful practice. Take a picture of the contents of your refrigerator the minute you get in the room, and when you leave so you don’t get suckered like me.  ",,KarenP5296,3,3.0

We all rolled our eyes at one another.

The window in the room could not be opened at all so the room was stuffy and badly needed some fresh air. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were too plump and hurt my neck so I had to sleep without the pillow.

We tried to check in early but rooms were still filled.. WE returned about 30 minutes after check in to find out that our room wasnt ready because someone hadnt left the room we were supposed to be in or something. We were asked to return in about an hour. That didnt work for me. I explained that we had plans and that that would be too much of an inconvenience. Shortly after, another employee stepped in and gave us another room.

Per usual there's hella fees that you pay in NYC that you don't pay elsewhere so be prepared for that.

We live close to NYC, but since it was Spring Break and we had some appointments in the city, we decided to stay over. First thing, unless you are a tourist or love the idea of Times Square, the area is dirty and seemingly homeless people hang out on the street to the right of the hotel - all hours of the day. The front desk was woefully understaffed. There would often be one person at the desk with a snaking line of people checking in. The front desk staff is not especially helpful. I called down one day to speak with the concierge and was told "" it's really busy, you'll have to call later"". The biggest pet peeve was the elevator. There is no freight elevator! So, the staff, bellman, etc. would often occupy one of the 3 elevators. We were on the 35th floor, so this quickly got old. Other pet peeves - housekeeping would skip our room occasionally. When we called for fresh towels, they wouldn't take the used ones - leaving us with a pile of used towels by the last day. The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night - thankfully, a false alarm - but, the lack of clear communication, a few different ""fire directors"" coming over the speaker, etc. left my daughter afraid that we either were not safe or were being pranked. Good things: bathroom was nice, large flatscreen TV & a steamer.

After a very long day travelling when we arrived we were told there were no rooms and they were fully booked. There was no apology. The guy just told us to go and sit down and he would try and sort. He was gone for about 10 mins. He returned to the check in desk and continued to serve ... I then gained eye contact with me and shouted for us to come over. I was disappointed that when he came back he didn’t immediately come over to us and confirm he had found rooms for us. Also it would have been a good gesture if he had offered us a complimentary drink whilst we waited. To top this bad experience we then found our checking out process below our expectations. Extremely disappointed with the Director on checking out. He was rude, inefficient and had an attitude with with a hint of sarcasm. We were querying the charges with the young girl. We were at fault as we had not read the small print so she was trying to explain it. My friend was confused as we had already been charged a $150 holding deposit and needed to pay an additional fee. The Director interrupted and belittled my friend. Also, As there was a long queue forming I asked the director if he could serve me as the people behind us were being kept waiting. His reply was that he was meant to be in a meeting and that as director he doesn’t serve! I then asked if he had anyone to assist the queue and he then began to serve!His attitude was extremely disappointing. I’m not sure what his role is as director but clearly it’s not meant to be customer facing.  Good points of the hotel ... the young lady restaurant manager was extremely efficient, professional, helpful and informative during our stayThe waiters, waitresses and the bell boys were all very friendly and polite. We were pleased with the cleanliness of the rooms. The rooms were compact but perfect for what we needed considering we only slept in them. In summary, as a Manager in Retail Finance, working front of house with many years of member experience, I would definitely recommend a refocus on your front of house staff. In particular I am interested in gaining an understanding of the Director role. This may help me understand the reason why this young man gave such appalling service.","Ashford, United Kingdom","loumatcham</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ashford, United Kingdom</strong>",2,2.0

But unfortunately I didn't ask the name of the staff. Most of them have an attitude when you challenge them about something. Guess this is normal as we had a similar treatment on most of the places we have been in Ny.-The lifts are insufficient, once I stayed for 18 minutes waiting for a lift to be available.

The room was ready at 5:15. They didn’t offer me an explanation nor a compensation. I specifically arrived after the check in time so I wouldn’t have to wait and I ended up waiting. The check in time was already late and to not have my room ready was extremely frustrating. The front desk wasn’t even a little sympathetic. I asked if they could offer me something and she responded no. I wanted to get a refund and just not stay there anymore but they told me they couldn’t offer that. Then she proceeds to ask me “do you still want the room?” Well if I can’t get a refund I guess I don’t have a choice right? Usually a hotel will offer a free meal ticket or something to makeup for the inconvenience but nope not this one. The room itself was small but pretty standard for nyc hotels. It was clean and the design was nice. The bed however wasn’t comfortable, it was very soft my back was starting to cramp. It’s a very modern design there’s a lot of buttons in the room that have no explanation for what it’s for. Some are self explanatory but there’s one in the bathroom that has like 1 minute, 60 minute switch which I had no idea what it was for. The tv had no TV guide I had to go on the internet to check what was on tv. It had regular cable channels and hbo. Nothing special as all the modern tv now has Netflix, Hulu. There’s a burger restaurant located right downstairs, I got a burger and fries. Burger was average but the fries were soggy... unfortunately I ordered take out. Wonder if it would be the same if I dined in? I wouldn’t come back as service was below standard and I didn’t get a good nights rest. The people in the hallway from the other rooms were making so much noise at 8 am and the walls are paper thin so it woke me up.

I specifically booked this hotel for the hotel bar which closes at 1 AM on a Friday night and for NYC that’s early. I was so disappointed that the bar was not open later but I figured as long as the room was nice I could just go to another bar. Upon check in, I waited about 20 minutes while hearing some annoying loud and consistent beeping sound from their alarm system on the wall to the right of the front desk. Not one of the staff thought to eradicate the sound. Someone wearing all black walks in after spitting in the garbage can in the lobby and turned it off finally. Once I finally got to the desk, I was prepared to just pay for the room incidental charge of $150 that I was aware of. I was told that the room was never paid for even thought I went online to their website to pay. I then advised the two people handling my check in that I paid online and I wanted to use a separate card to pay for the $150 fee. Since the room was never charged I gave them permission to use the details they had online to pay for the room. The front staff said “I’m sorry it declined”. I told her that’s impossible and to try again. After she tried again I asked, how much are you charging to this card? She then replies “oh the room charges plus the room incidental fee”. I immediately got angry because I waited all that time, then had to deal with the confusion of them not already charging the room to my card as intended and her not listening to me saying from the beginning that I would be using another card for the room incidental charge. I was tired and frustrated that I had to repeat myself AGAIN! The process was slow and very much annoying. I finally get thought the check in process and get the room keys. I go up to the room and it’s the size of a matchbox. I didn’t expect a gigantic room as I’m from New York and know hotel rooms in the city are usually not very large. I didn’t however expect that the bathroom would be an arms length beyond the bed and hidden behind a mirror on the wall like a closet. The is probably the smallest NYC room that I’ve ever had. I spent over $200 for one night in what I would consider a cage. I called to tell the front desk that I was unhappy with the view and asked for a room on a higher floor. I was told that the hotel was at full capacity so they couldn’t move me. I know that was a lie because when I was at the front desk checking in someone just had their room moved and the staff said they were looking though the available rooms for “king beds” because that’s what I paid for. The thing to notice here is that there were other room options that I was not offered period. The room temperature when I walked in was like a sauna and I had a view of a rooftop parking lot! I was so upset by this. Overall, my trip was ruined by this hotel stay. I wish I never booked here and I will NEVER go back not even for free. The only thing I want at this point are the 3 free gifts I was promised for booking directly with the hotel which I STILL don’t have.

Let's start with check in, the absolute downfall to my stay. We arrived in NYC from AZ on a redeye. I didnt expect the hotel to check us in at 0900hrs, however we arrived to drop our bags and hit the town. Upon arrival, the lobby is tremendously small and cramped. The desk lady was nice, checked our bags, sympathized with us being on a redeye and told us they would text us as soon as a room was ready, so we could check in early and get cleaned up. Hours go by, no text. Get to check in time, stil no text. So we go back, after standard check in, and attempt to check in. By this time, my wife and I had been up for 36hrs. Get our room keys, go to the room. Room door bell is red, and key doesn't work. I recall seeing online that a red doorbell means do not disturb. Our key doesn't work. Back down the limited elevator. After a wait, they give us another key, assuring us the room was empty. Back up after a 10 minute wait for an elevator. Key doesn't work. They call in an engineer. They say it's mechanical failure. Wait another 30 minutes, then are told the room is ready. About to board elevator, and told actually the room is not ready. Wait another 20 to 30 minutes. Manager offers us one drink. We accept, and defer until after we get cleaned. Tech takes us up, says theres still work to be done on lock but he will over ride and get us in room. He bypassed the lock to find the privacy lock latched. Privacy lock latched plus do not disturb equals someone probably in the room, but that didn't click with them. They force privacy lock open to find people still sleeping in the room.. oops. Sheer embarrassment on hotel staff faces. Back down we go to get another room. About 30 more minutes go by. They assign us an ""upgrade"" room. We get to that room, doorbell is white. Key works. I had to ask for a second drink as compensation as they were content leaving it at one drink initially for almost 2 hours of mess ups. Room was very clean, but very VERY small. Not sure what the ""upgrade"" was. Bed was very comfortable, view was good. Staff downstairs was very disorganized. We get up to the roof bar for our drinks and order round 1. After round 1, I attempt to order round 2. They say hotel staff only granted us 1 round. I tell them no, we were assured 2. Rather than call, the bar manager has to go down 41 floors to confirm it is in fact 2 rounds. Comes back up 15 minutes later and takes our next order. Moral of the story is, if things go smooth, you'll probably enjoy your stay in a very cramped room. If it doesn't, hotel staff doesn't do well with things not going their way. Will not stay here again, as the compensation for our troubles was not worth the trouble itself. Not even sort of. Stick with a bigger name hotel who has the bugs worked out",,Rabidfox76,1,2.0

Not comfortable to sleep on, and it made me wake up in the middle of the night all the time- The hotel has 41 floors, but only 3 elevators, which are also used by hotel staff. This means that at busy times you’ll be waiting 5 or 10 minutes- The heater is this combined heating/ac that blows cold or hot air into the room. It is installed on the bottom of the wall, next to the desk. When I wanted to do some work sitting at the desk, I had constant warm or cold air blowing in my face. Shutting it down would make the room too cold (I was staying in the winter), also because cold air would come in through the unit, freezing my feet. Also, the air was extemely dry, my skin peeling and itching.- The top sheet of the bed is extremely staticly charged.

Its a short walk from Penn Station (at 34th st) and its around the corner (8th Ave) from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. This is a plus and minus. A plus if you are using public transportation to visit NYC. We parked in Secaucus and took the train in. It saved me on parking & tunnel fees. That positive is offset by a negative however. I was accosted by those in need whenever I left the hotel and walked down 40th or 8th. I also had to walk through a bit of pot smoke each time. Adjacent to the hotel is an apartment building, then a Chinese food restaurant and then an entrance to the Port Authority Bus Terminal underground. Aliz Hotel itself is nearly renovated. The rooms were small -- but that is common for the city and in older buildings. The bathroom was beautiful. Dual shower jets were glorious. The mirrors on both sides of the walls attempt to make the room look larger, but sort of fail. The bed in our room could be replaced. It was a little lumpy. Again...location location. The noise level of Times Square can be overwhelming at times. So having a good mattress can matter to a light sleeper. The room was clean. Aliz Hotel wants to be upscale. The lobby was beautiful. The bar looked entertaining. We did not use the restaurant or skytop bar. Nor did I use the cycling center below ground. I saw many guests use both so I'm sure they are very nice. Recognizing that Aliz Hotel wants to be upscale..I have to say. They put a hold of 150.00 on my card for 'incidentals'. Meaning I guess, it would be their version of the minibar? 2 Fiji 15oz waters and a 1 liter Fiji water. in a mini fridge. The 1 liter Fiji water would have cost 8.00 if I had used it. From a hospitality standpoint. I was disappointed. The reservation clerk upon checkin/check out said 'all' the hotels place holds. I've been staying in NYC for 20 years and this is the first time. I've stayed at several upscale hotels and no hold. Merely the charge for the room. Because of that...we will not return. Coupled with its location. There are better hotels, in similar locations.

The receptionist was calling while checking me in, not even apologizing or explaining to me. 1 out of 3 elevators was broke, this made the wait sometimes more than 15 minutes. All of this is understandable, the hotel is new and i’m sure that once they will improve this your stay will be great. Once again, the room and it’s location are perfect. The bad ending was the bill we got. They have charged us breakfast, that we have never ever used! They didn’t show the bill while checkout and told us that everything was okay, that they will charge the room and that’s it.

I booked through travelzoo.com and received an amazing rate of $127.00 per night. We stayed 2 nights January 2nd and 3rd. I called the hotel directly to see if we could add another night for the 1st but they were sold out. The rate quoted was $375.00. Big difference!We arrived at the hotel at 11:00 am on The 2nd and thought we would store or luggage untill the check in time later that evening. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a well dressed porter and front desk attendant. There were no lines. The lobby is very modern and clean. The lady who checked us in was friendly and efficient. She stated they would not need to to store or luggage and could accommodate us right away. We were so excited to get into our room early!****When we got into the elevator we realized it would not work until you flashed your card over a reader. This is a VERY important detail that needed to be told when we checked in. There were 5 other people in the elevator with us and they had no idea either. I am use to inserting a card to go to certain floors but not to actually ""run"" the elevator. ********I read all the negative reviews on the size of the rooms ahead of time. I found the room to be a good size. There were 3 of us ladies with several bags each and we made it work. The room decor was beautiful. The room was EXTREMELY Clean. The marble bathroom was so nice. Water pressure was firm and the water was HOT. That is all I need to be happy. The room temperature was hot. We cut it down several times but it seemed to never truly cool off. **** The chrome door handle on the sliding bathroom door was very sharp. I did not break skin but came very close several times****The rooms provided hair dryers, coffee , tea and water. Only the small Fiji waters are complimentary. The large ones are at a cost.We had absolutely no complaints on our room. We used the do not disturb the entire time so I have no opinion on steward staff.On our way out to explore the city, we noticed flavored water in the lobby. What a very nice touch!We did not dine in the restaurant. We did utilized the roof top bar. We got into the elevator and couldn't figure out why it would go to the top floor. I finally gave up and asked someone. They told me that all the elevators do not go up. You have to use a specific one. *** There were no signs and the front desk did not mention this***The second you step off the elevator to the rooftop it takes your breathe away! Remarkable views of the city. There are 2 sides of the lounge, make sure you visit both directions. The doors are Plexiglas and appear to have the ability to open all the way for alfresco dining in the summer. I can only imagine what that will be like!We ordered a drink and was told they couldn't make it. That they only could make drinks from their list. I looked over the cocktails and settled on a Manhattan. I am in the Hospitality business and have been for 27 years. This was the first time I have ever returned a drink. It was not good. I apologized to the bartender, he explained that they only serve Pre- prohibition drinks and that they may be an acquired taste. I'll say.. It just wasn't good.In my experience you shouldn't limit your offerings to one ""type"" of cocktail. But he took care of us and credited the drink. He was very accommodating.The area around the hotel is fine. Some people say it is sketchy. Not at all. It is very close to the Subway too!Times square in 5 minutes walk. Great location for everything! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I will definitely be back. I am a fan!I hope you find this review helpful!

It was my dream to visit New York but did not have a good experience with accommodation. Having not realized this is a new hotel, I booked without much hesitation as the room prices were good value, considering it was over the new year period. After reading other reviews and the experience I had I now see the hotel has a lot of teething problems. So when myself and my partner checked in my bank card was CHARGED the full amount of the stay plus a 150 dollar deposit, which I understand as this is a lot of hotels policy. I was told this was going to be the only payment taken because logically it included the room and deposit. So why would there be a need to charge the card again? Little did I know. We had a nice three day stay, the room was comfortable and clean, the rooftop bar was excellent and the location of the hotel was pretty much perfect. To me the rate of the room seemed very fair as it was a great hotel in the centre of manhattan.What caused me stress and hassle was when we checked out the girl at the reception, who was quite unfriendly, failed to mention that my card would be charged the full room rate once again. She said everything had been taken care of with the room when we checked in. So we left. The next day I checked my bank and discovered the card had been charged again. So at this point the hotel had taken 549 + 399 dollars from my account. The excuse is that the 549 is held, but it is as good as taken out as the bank does not allow you to withdraw that money and therefore you are left with very little money, as most people I imagine are in January after the holidays. This to me was totally unacceptable. After trying to solve this over the phone with a woman who worked at the hotel, who more or less told me I was mistaken and definitely didnt have any time for me, I had to get in contact with the manager of the hotel, who told me the first charge would be refunded to my account within 10 business days. Then after the 10 business days my card was charged 399 dollars again! For what reason this is beyond me...then I had to wait another 2-3 days for that to be refunded.Safe to say I am very unhappy and will not be staying again.If you choose to stay at Aliz be sure the same doesnt happen to you.","Galicia, Spain","Helenmcd3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Galicia, Spain</strong>",0,2.0

I’m not being compensated in any way for this review.For the past month, I’ve stayed in a couple of different NYC hotels. I am a frequent visitor to NYC and am very familiar with all of the boroughs. However, despite my many trips through Port Authority, I had no idea that this hotel was literally next door on 40th street. Most of my hotel stays have been at Marriotts around the country, so that is my “gold standard” for hotel service, quality and amenities. Aliz Hotel is solid gold. This hotel is all about luxurious details so prepare to be “wowed”!The location is perfect for tourists. Port Authority is not only an interstate travel hub, but the subway system is inside, so all you have to do is cross the street and be connected to almost all of the subway lines. Plus you’re only 2 blocks from Times Square.CHECK IN: I was immediately and warmly greeted when I arrived early. I was allowed to check-in early, which was very convenient because I was very tired from traveling. There is a $150 incidentals credit or debit card hold. The lobby is clean, gorgeous and luxurious with many seating areas. When I arrived there was no Elevator operator, but later that afternoon and evening, polite young men were stationed to press “Up” or “Down” for me which was a nice touch, but probably too extravagant for my taste.Elevator service is fast (there are 41 floors) and the Elevator is an experience with music and mirrors! My room on the 12th floor had a nice view of Times Square and only 1 window. I could also look down on Port Authoritys rooftop garage which I never knew existed!MY ROOM: Extremely elegant and clean room as pictured. Unfortunately, I did not get one with a bathtub. I asked the Front Desk about it and was told that rooms with tubs must be requested. The bed was the most comfortable I’ve slept in (other than the world famous Marriott bad). My bed at the Holiday Inn-Financial District was very good, but not as good as this one. My bed at the Hilton-Garden Inn Midtown was also not as comfortable as this one. But my bed at Madison LES is a close second to this one.The COMPLIMENTARY ROBE was soooo soft!The floors DO NOT HAVE CARPET so bring slippers or your feet will be cold. Lots of TV channels. Because I was feeling a little sick, I stayed in more than usual. I was surprised by how many cable channels were available. There is a FRIDGE in the room stocked with WATER (you will have to pay if you drink it). I didn’t have any food to store in it so ask the front desk before you open it.The BATHROOM is OUTSTANDING. The shower attachment is very rare in hotel rooms, especially at this price point (Less than $100/night). The bathroom wall has a light timer of 1,5, 10, or 20 minutes. Every surface is marble (or marble-ized) and sparkling clean. Water temperature is consistently hot at all times of day and night. The toilet tissue is artfully arranged. Excellent goat’s milk amenities (shower gel, shampoo/conditioner, lotion, and handsoap. A DOORBELL is on your room. So when the Front Desk brought me sugar, they rang it. It’s a very cute touch.NYC hotel rooms are not large and I felt a little cramped (I’m 5’5’”) so a really tall or large person may still feel slightly cramped,but the elegance of this property is worth it.STAFF: Both front desk and housekeeping were all warm and polite. I asked a couple of different staff how to get to the business center, including one who appeared to be off duty and everyone was consistently warm and polite. BUT I think the front desk staff should at least offer upgrades or ask about preferences (like high floor availability).AMENITIES: I used the business center downstairs with my iPad to wirelessly print. It’s just a corner with two computers and a printer.The gym is right next door. It’s not full service, just a few treadmills. As soon as the elevators open, anyone can see you working out.The ROOFTOP deck is SIMPLY EXTRAORDINARY. You must go up at night. The view is spectacular.DRAWBACKS: Old-fashioned chain shade pulley in room. It was very loud and a bit hard to pull. No complimentary breakfast (restaurants are on site). If you want an ultra-elegant and affordable stay in the city, THIS IS IT!","Hartford, Connecticut","CoCo775</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hartford, Connecticut</strong>",17,5.0

Immediately upon arriving I was blown away at how courteous and accommodating the hotel staff was. I had arrived 8 hours prior to check in, and although my room was not ready, I was able to leave my luggage in storage and they offered to text me when it would be ready. This allowed me to head around town, grab breakfast and get things done without having to worry about my luggage. The staff reached out to me 2 hours prior to the check in time and informed me that our room was ready! It was, without a doubt, a surprise and delight moment in which they also offered to bring our luggage to our room. The rooftop lounge had a stunning view of the city, and the servers were also pleasant. Joseph served us two nights, and his customer service was exceptional alongside his suggestions. The lounge is only open from 4-11, and when we asked, they mentioned that it was because it was still relatively new. This worked out for us because it wasn't crowded or overly busy. The room was slightly tight, but it was comfortable, had a great view and did had everything we needed. The Aliz is a hotel that I will continue to stay at in my many upcoming trips back to New York City, and is one I will suggest to family and friends wishing to visit. It is a reasonable distance from the shows on Broadway, Times Square, Hell's Kitchen and many amazing $1 slice pizza places for those late-night adventure seekers!","Stockton, California","dregarcia85</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockton, California</strong>",0,5.0

The room is very cocooning but extremely small (a suitcase can not open in the room, you will have to put it on the bed to do this). The bedding is excellent and the room was clean. Cleaning is done at the end of the day around 6pm. Even if the floor is dirty the housekeeper does not the vacuum or broom. The maid only remakes the bed. During my stay I was ""hacked"", someone took control of my phone. It only happened when I was in the room, outside and in France I never had this kind of problem ...

The location of the hotel was perfect for us. You're pretty much right at Times Square and you have great access to the subway and walking distance to about anything you could want to visit.All of the staff was super friendly to us. Joshua went out of his way to make our stay memorable. I've seen some people say the rooms are small, but from what I've read, most hotel rooms in NYC are on the smaller side. The four of us had no problem staying in a double room. We thought the rooms were very nice, especially for the price. It had a big screen tv, mini fridge, Keurig, hair dryer, steam iron and a shower with a handheld showerhead if you wanted to use it. We thought the décor was beautiful too.We were able to go into the rooftop bar to see it before it was open for the evening, which we were very appreciative of. The views from there were AMAZING!! If I had to pick something negative, the only ""complaint"" from our entire stay at the hotel was we asked two different people if the rooftop bar would be open Sunday night and we were told yes both times. Unfortunately, when we tried to go to it Sunday night, we were told that it's closed on Sunday and Monday nights. I'm sure being a new hotel and new staff, there was just a miscommunication. If that's the worst of our stay, we can deal with it.I think you'll be happy staying at this new hotel if you give it a chance.",Oak Grove,"Loenuf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oak Grove</strong>",40,5.0

I suppose it has built to improve the street so hopefully the rest of the street will be updated soon too!Room: Extremely small but very clean. We had an issue where the toilet blocked. I called housekeeping at 6am but they do not start until 7am so someone came to fix the toilet but the bathroom was still flooded so we could not use it. I asked for housekeeping to come urgently. When we returned to our room in the late afternoon it was still not cleaned. We had to go downstairs to wait for at least an hour until it was cleaned. We were told it was ready but when we went upstairs it was still not done. Went downstairs again to wait and were offered complimentary drinks at the restaurant. Unfortunately the staff were not told they were complimentary and ran after us for payment!Restaurant: Breakfast is good. Cereals and fruit and some hot options of egg, sausage and bacon but these were only luke warm. Lunch/Dinner at the restaurant was excellent although the menu has limited choices.We would have liked to visit the newly opened rooftop bar but this was closed for private functions on both nights we were there.The reception staff were not very friendly and I got the impression that because the hotel is so new, the staff are rather untrained.

I woke up in my room at 7am to the sound of a loud fire alarm that was going off in every room throughout the hotel. It went on for about 10 minutes before it was turned off. I called the front desk and they said it was a false alarm. It then proceeded to go off again. And again. The alarm went on and off again and again (starting at random times until someone shut it off) over the course of the next TWO HOURS (7am - 9am), and when they finally had it under control at 9am and the alarm stopped going off, they announced over the loud speaker (which is in every hotel room) that it was a false alarm and they have everything under control now.I attempted to call the front desk to see if I could get a late check out, but nobody would answer the front desk from my hotel room phone.When I went down to check out, I asked for a partial refund. Given that the fire alarm was going on and off over the course of 2 hours (about 20 times total... not an exaggeration), I thought this would be fair. The woman at the front desk went to speak with a guy (I’m assuming he was the manager), and then came back to tell me they’re not offering discounts but instead are offering credit for a future stay. I asked if there was anything they could do about THIS stay, and she said unfortunately not. I then agreed to a credit and she went back to talk to the manager (same guy as before, presuming he’s the manager), and then they both came back and he told me that “the information had been miscommunicated to me and that credit is only being offered for repeat customers”. Since I hadn’t stayed with them before, the offer was not open to me. I asked if there was anything they could do and they said they couldn’t since it was a real fire alarm (which isn’t true because it went off about 20 times on and off and they also ANNOUNCED to every hotel room that it was a false alarm), and then the manager walked away. It’s the holiday season in NYC and this hotel wouldn’t give me the time of day or consider my basic needs. There are so many options in NYC and Times Square - Consider your other options before staying at Aliz. Truly close to the worst hotel experiences I’ve ever had.

Most rooms with two beds were listed for at least $300 per night I’m assuming due to the influx of people visiting NYC for the Christmas holiday. Location: The hotel is in a great spot. The street the hotel is on has a plethora of other hotels and many eating places. Short walk to the middle of Time Square. Hotel: From my understanding the hotel is fairly new so the interior and exterior reflect a modern clean feel. There is a bar, sitting area, and of course check in desk. The young lady who checked us in was great. She informed us about the hotel’s amenities. This is a boutique hotel so smaller in nature but plenty of modern charm. The room itself was a typical smaller NYC hotel room. Reading the reviews from guest I gather most people have either have never travelled to NYC or have not read the reviews regarding the room size. Guys... please understand the room is not huge and you shouldn’t expect that in NYC. I booked a double room (2 beds). It was equipped with tv & chair and desk area, clean and bright white marble bathroom, and and a small cabinet which housed a Keureg coffee maker with sugar, cream, etc. there were plenty of hangers provided but not enough for two people so decide what’s important and hang accordingly. Keep in mind there is NO closet. There is one luggage crate so again decide who gets what. The beds were very comfortable and the lines were fresh and clean. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels for two people. My gripe regarding the bathroom would be the bathrobe. With booking a double room I would assume two bathrobes would be provided but no only one. The outside room doors in proximity to other doors are VERY close. With that in mind please be aware you will be able to hear conversations outside your door and doors slamming as well. No fault of the hotel you should just be aware. Now for the not so good:Elevators: On the website it states the hotel has invested in a state of the art elevator system. Though the elevator is fast in nature unfortunately it’s not always efficient. The numbers were not accurate as it is displayed and people were visibly upset that the hotel only has 3 elevators. Rooftop loung and bar:So according to the bartenders and front desk the rooftop lounge and bar has only been operational for about 3 days. Let me just say it is EVERYTHING and more! The view is breathtaking and the ambiance is unmatched. Drinks were around $17. BUT for the petty unhappy me. Saturday the space had a private event so guest were only to enjoy the space for 1 hour. The special event started at 6:30pm. I was a mad somebody. This is your third day and it’s closed!!!!!!! Ok... so let’s fast forward to Sunday. I’m all excited it’s been raining and snowing so let me take the elevator to the 40th floor. Guest what guys it’s dark no bartenders no one. I go down to the lobby bar to ask when it’s open and guess what. IT’S NOT OPEN ON SUNDAY!!!! Now I’m speechless. Literally everyone at the lobby bar made the same statement on how they couldn’t believe it was advertised but not open. Let me make this statement so I’m clear. The more this bar is shut down the more unhappy comments will show up on TripAdvisor. I’m calling it now. They have to correct this and fast. All and all this hotel has major potential to be a great spot in NYC. Would I stay here again YES it was worth every penny.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","travelallthetime83</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",4,4.0

Unfortunately, the street where the hotel is located is unpleasant, and the hotel is only about a block from a dirty adult entertainment/video booth establishment. I was harassed by vagrants asking for money as I entered and exited the hotel. Maybe this will improve with time, but I would avoid this area now - as it didn't feel safe.

Then a couple of weeks before we were going, I looked at reviews on Facebook and someone said that it wasn’t open yet. So I contacted the hotel and they apologised that I was never told when I booked as I had paid a lot of money to stay, and that they would come and meet us when we got there to make sure everything was ok...this never happened. We got to the hotel and the receptionist tried to charge us the whole bill again as apparently they had no record of payment. I then told her I can show my online banking as I had paid it and then she dissapeared into the back to find out what happened. She then came back and was not apologetic at all, just continued to tell us we had to pay another $300 for a deposit!!! I understand paying a deposit, but $300 is very excessive and left us short for the rest of our trip. We then went up to our room and it was tiny!! The pictures on the website are very deceiving and there is no room at all, I had paid for a view and it was ok if you looked upwards but straight ahead was a huge car park! However, good parts were that check in wasn’t meant to be until 4 but our room was ready early which was great. After the first day, the rest of the staff are always happy to help and let you use the reception phone and our room was very clean. Overall, I would not reccomend this hotel if you are going for a celebration as it is probably better for business trips on your own as it is very very overpriced and cramped.",,Roving35152414487,0,3.0

The room was small but acceptable for NYC, though it did appear that the rooms were not quite ready yet (i.e. a hole in the wall above the door where a fire sprinkler likely should have been). During the stay one of the elevators went down for quite a while. This was particularly problematic just because of the limited elevators and the crowds sometimes waiting for them. The biggest problem with the hotel was the horrible customer service I received with an issue as I left. I was in a rush to leave on a Sunday and left a blue blazer inside the closet of the hotel room. I called the hotel within 24 hours to report it and asked them to send it my way. They said they hadn't found it yet but would call me back with an update. The staff never called back. I called back a day or two later only to be told they didn't find anything and that there was nothing to do. First, it is absurd to think they couldn't find the blazer given the size, location, and time in which it was reported. Second, promising a call back and then failing to deliver is absolutely unacceptable behavior from a hotel. Finally, the way the staff responded to my issue was rude and unhelpful. It is things like this that show a hotel staff isn't ready.

Well I need not have worried, my transfer vehicle was met at the door and from there on it was 5 star service. The staff on reception were most polite and especially helpful when they knew that I was a solo traveller first time in New York and the US. They advised me on the best way to travel around and where to get a pass for the week which covered buses and the subway and also supplied me with that essential item known as a map. Also my luggage was taken up to my room while I finished the check in formalities so I was able to have a most welcome G and T in the lobby bar before going up to unpack. And what a room. Spotlessly clean well appointed with a fantastic on-suite. The shower was more than roomy and a pleasure everyday. The bed was a joy to lie in,so comfortable it was difficult to get up in the mornings and if it hadn't been New York I would probably spent most of my week away in that bed..There was plenty of toiletries in the on-suite and the bathrobe was like wearing a fluffy cloud.

We’ve stayed in many of the hotels in the theater district and decided to try the brand new Aliz last night. Big mistake. While the room was smaller than we’re accustomed to, the fact that it was brand new and immaculate made up fit that. The problems are the elevators. Only two of the three elevators were in service during our stay. And somehow, they kept passing our floor without stopping. We literally waited 20 mins to get downstairs. We heard them ding and then whiz by without stopping. When we returned after the show a fellow guest could not get the elevator to stop on his floor so he rode up to ours and walked down 5 flights. He had a key card and it just wouldn’t work. In addition to the elevators not working properly, there is the permanent problem of no service elevator. When an elevator finally stopped, in addition to being crowded with guests, the cleaning staff and their buckets were crowding on too. On my last trip out there were 5 or 6 guests in the elevator when a staff member, with a large luggage rack pushed his way on. Also, the insulation is so poor, we heard the elevators dinging until 2am. It’s really too bad, it would have been nice to have a new hotel in the neighborhood.

As an IPrefer Elite member, I trusted the brand as a boutique, service oriented hotelier offering a certain level of experience per the IPrefer brand. Checked in to find my television was not working, the reception was very scrambled with sound cutting in and out. Staying for three days this would be an issue for me so I let the desk know and left for the remainder of the day. Returned at 9pm and nofollow up on the TV situation. Upon entering my room the tv still is not viewable. Visited the front desk and was told this was a hotel wide issue pertaining to the vendor. I asked this time to please follow up as to when it may be fixed and requested a room change. They are overbooked and cannot move me to another room until the next day and they are sorry. Ok...Decided to grab a cappuccino from the bar. (Bar is in lobby with literally four stools and about 8’ long) Great bartender but rowdy crowd and he actually helped me defer some handsy gentleman trying to buy me shots. Kudos to the bartender. He’s a gem. Go back to my room. Phone rings and Tiana lets me know the TV will likely be an issue and they will move me in the morning and she will give me a free breakfast. I informed her my rate included breakfast. Again she is sorry. Ok. Staff is nice but young and inexperienced...she didn’t know what my room rate even was. Hotel footprint is small so be prepared to hear your neighbors and the elevator all night. Comfortable bed and probably the nicest robe I’ve slipped on at a hotel, but with no tv to drown out the noise I didn’t sleep well. Wake up to take a hot shower in this tiny but gorgeous bathroom. I’m in for maybe three minutes and I notice the shower is not draining. Opt for dry shampoo and get out quickly as to not flood the bathroom. So much for a hot shower before my conference...Realize my blouse is a bit wrinkled and alas, no iron but only a steamer. Ok. Let’s give that a try. As others mentioned this is a tight room. Nowhere to really properly hang anything to steam it and the short cord doesn’t make it much easier. Now I have a semi-wrinkled water spotted blouse. Go to outfit two. While changing maintenance comes by to inquire about my plumbing leak. I have no leak but I’m sure someone else does. I tell him about the shower not draining and tv not working. He says he is sorry and will come back later. At this point I phoned the AC down the street. I’m silver with Marriott so hoping that may help secure a room. I pack up and go to the desk to try and cancel my next two days. Again they offer to put me in a different room later in the day and to have breakfast. No thanks. I already paid for that and I don’t have tune now to eat. I’m going to be late and need to figure out where I’m staying because I’m not doing this three days. I’ll take my business somewhere else. I needed a good nights rest, an operable shower and a tv that works. Additionally I could not figure out how to operate the lamp,sconces or track lighting. I’m pretty savvy but if it’s that difficult they need to provide instructions. Photos of scrambled tv and non draining shower. Again it’s all pretty but not operable. Staff is nice but all young and inexperienced. Billed me for half the night - but now when I look at the charge that is not correct either...go figure. They also do not have a roof bar or room service and only offer breakfast with a grab and go - $8 for water. Photos are of non operable tv and water filled, non draining shower. Walked down to AC and they took my bags and promised a room by midday. Scattered today but hoping for a better stay there.",,Jbhtx76,2,2.0

The hotel is new and nicely designed. Loved the croc skin wallpaper/background in the elevator which was consistent with the room decor. Loved all the mirrors in the room. The girls loved the bed and the sliding door with dual mirrors to the all-marble bathroom with great toiletries. The room size was ample. Since we stayed just 1 night, we didn't have suitcases which I imagine would take up space in a cozy room. Views were great as well.

Staying here for 9 days and currently have 5 to go. Great location and staff friendly especially housekeeping staff. However the system they have for housekeeping is quite strange. Travelling with another couple they had their room serviced on first day and we didn’t. Asking at reception we were informed we didn’t request it. Well our friends didn’t either. The repose was they must have done with the light system on the door. I have since learnt green means service. Red DND and off is when the cleaning staff change it to when room is done. Not advised of this on check in Great if it works. You will come back after a long day. Room not serviced and both of us have had to wait in two occasions downstairs while rooms cleaned. Next is housekeeping will knock on your door while sleeping asking if you want your room cleaned after they had cleaned it. Seems they don’t understand their own system. Reception and housekeeping because both don’t understand when you ask how to fix the problem. Rooms are clean but small. Asked on check in if there are bigger rooms and told know. There are slightly bigger rooms we have seen them when doors left open.I think the reception staff think we are cereal complainers. We are not. But they look at us when we apprisch like we are Continplating if we should check or early Trevor Wilson,,TrevorNVG,3,3.0

Lovely hotel in close proximity to Times Square directly over road from Port Authority bus/tube station. As our visit was for our 10th wedding anniversary and our daughters upcoming 18th, I had emailed the hotel asking for a room with a nice view for which I received an automated reply. I was slightly disappointed they didn’t consider my request and we got a room overlooking the building behind the hotel but it was worth a try. The hotel is very impressive decoratively and the rooms are lovely, although a tight squeeze for 3 adults and a child however most hotels seem to have the same limited space. Beds were possibly the comfiest I’ve ever slept on and our room was cleaned daily when we requested this by pressing a button in the room. Sometimes the standard wasn’t the same I.e floor not swept/coffee etc not topped up. Also disappointed there was only one dressing gown supplied for four guests because again, the comfiest dressing gown ever so we ended up fighting over it! Not a great deal of storage space but we managed and only a few hangers in the wardrobe so maybe take a few extra. We didn’t get a lot of information on check and I hadn’t been made aware of the $75 per night deposit as it wasn’t on the hotel info when I booked but this may have been the agents issue rather than the hotel.

King bed is extremely comfortable and I love the plush bathrobe. Bathroom amenities top notch. Once I learnt from staff how to control the switch for the levels of lighting on the wall behind the bed then it went all the way down from bright to dim to no lighting.

Although they were nice enough to check us in early, since they were not fully occupied, they gave us a room that was already occupied! Then at night, while we were sleeping, someone else walked into our room!! Apparently they had alotted the room to someone else as well!! Key cards were required for the lifts, but they did not work, and we had to keep asking one of the staff to use their access cards to punch in our floor in the lift. One day, my daughter's card was not unlocking the room; when she asked for another card they told her there was no booking under our name for that room and kept her waiting for an hour!! The room was not serviced/cleaned the first day, since the housekeeping staff thought it was unoccupied. We had to ask them to get the room cleaned. The staff are nice enough, but very lost and disorganized. The room itself was decent with two queen beds and a tiny bathroom. Everything was clean and well maintained, since it was all new. Breakfast was not included in the room rate and although they did serve breakfast, it was steep. The hotel is conveniently located, close to Times Square.In all it is a decent place to stay.

And if people just keep giving 5 star reviews saying its acceptable because it is New York hotels will just keep charging more. With that out of they way....Overall the hotel is clean comfortable in a decent location to get around and the staff are pleasant. If your going now or soon then great you will benefit from the newness but I think once that wears off there wont be that much going for the hotel.You won't regret staying here or even have a bad time but I would probably only stay here if you get a great rate as there are too many other good hotels to choose from.Firstly as with all photos they are deceiving this hotel is tiny. The reception and the bar are opposite each other in the same open space and the rooms are very small (covered later). Don't let this put you off but just be aware its not a ""grand"" hotel.Location:It is within walking distance to most touristy must sees we only used the metro twice and walked everywhere else. It is within walking distance (10 minutes) of Penn station too if your getting the train from Newark so this was good.The street is behind the bus station so there are a few homeless people around but it is a busy street and you shouldn't feel unsafe they are just unfortunate people without homes they are not going to bother you. As for the probation office I didn't even notice it was there.The Room:The rooms are tiny, big enough for two people but just be prepared they are much smaller than the photos look and you might struggle with more than one big suitcase.I'm not sure I would pay for deluxe as the only difference is the higher room. The window is small and in the corner of the room so you don't really benefit from the view unless you go stand by the window. In my opinion its probably not worth the extra cost, especially once the rooftop opens.The beds are comfortable, the pillows are good and the towels are really soft. The wardrobe needs more hangers and the clothes steamer is pretty useless, they really should provide an iron at least on loan from reception.What I did find a little weird was the bedding. It consists of a very light duvet sandwiched between 2 sheets. It is not enclosed at all so inevitably it all comes apart and you end up with exposed duvet and sheets everywhere. Unless they are washing the duvet after each bed change its going to be pretty unhygienic .I would also say that the furniture in the room is pretty cheap and flimsy not a problem right now as it is new but I can't see how it will hold up over even a year. The blue indicator lights on the touch switches by the bed and TV are way too bright and they cant be shut off , I would imagine this will annoy a lot of people.Our room wasn't cleaned on one of the days even though we went out all day from 10:30 am.They had started providing water in the fridge on our last day and at $8 a bottle it must have some magical powers.Service:Firstly let me call out the guy who helped with luggage I think his name was Zakariy he was great.Check in and check out were fine just a little impersonal,it felt like checking in to a premier inn in the UK or travel lodge. The staff were nice but they didn't even ask if I had a nice stay. Surely they should be wanting feedback at a new hotel?Also I had mentioned it was my Wife's 30th (which they could see from passport too) and our anniversary and absolutely no notice was taken of it not even a well wish at check in. Again surely with a new hotel you want to impress guests?In summary None of the issues above ruined or even really affected our stay and hopefully the hotel will take them on board and not just reply saying sorry we cant please everyone.With a few tweaks here and there it does have potential but with the cost of a stay in New York I think the hotels should be exceptional not just ok.Would i stay again? Probably not simply because I would stay in a different part of Manhattan. Should you cancel if you have booked already ? No you will have a good time just make sure your expectations are set accordingly.","Belfast, United Kingdom","amberdemon84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Belfast, United Kingdom</strong>",6,3.0

I actually got to be there during opening week. Yes, that means I was there to experience some of the typical bumps that come from opening week, but I also got to be there to witness the swift action taken by staff to make sure accommodations were made and needs were met.  Here’s why I’m loving this hotel: Great location - I like being close enough to theater so I can walk, but far enough way that I am not in the madness of Time Square. You’re also right near 9th which has some of the best restaurants!  Smart design - The rooms are so thoughtfully designed that you aren’t even aware of the size - I actually have no idea the square footage of my standard room, but it felt roomy, open, fresh, and modern. LOVE the bathroom design and the bed was super comfy - these are bonuses.  Details - I appreciate touches like a super comfy robe, a staff that gets to know your name, and toiletries from a top brand …. these are the things that make you want to come back.  Work/Play hotel - I spend a couple weeks a month in NYC so I’m always looking for my “home away from home”, but not a hotel that feels like a “work” hotel. Aliz has created the perfect blend of feeling like home, while inviting you to play and enjoy the city.  By the time I left the hotel I could feel like it was finding it’s groove and had worked out some of those kinks.

The location is good - everything you need is right there and its an easy walk to the subway and everything else. As previously mentioned, the walk in from 7th is somewhat seedy - as there are already 4 hotels on this street between 7 and 8th, I'm sure things will improve down the road. Either way, it didn't bother us and I felt very safe walking in alone at midnight after the theatre. Every single staff member we interacted with where polite and friendly, they were all great representatives of this hotel. Our standard double room was typical NY small - not a shock and more than enough room for the two of us. Standard of furnishings/finishings was high, bathroom very nicely fitted with the best towels I've ever used, toiletries were U.S.-made and very nice. Shower powerful with good hot water. The small fridge was a nice perk. We did not use the F&B services but the breakfast buffet spread did look very good, it was just too expensive for us ($30 pp). We had no problems with noise, the street was quiet and we heard nothing from adjoining rooms or the hall, it was a good night's sleep both nights. The thermostat worked better on the second night than the first - too hot the first night, perfect the second. All building work appears to be completed and we saw/heard no construction work at all.THE BAD: The lobby entry is somewhat dangerous because its all clear glass and you have to take a minute to figure out what is a door and what is a window. The elevators are horrible - surprising for a new-build hotel. There is no indicator light on each floor to let you know where each car is, they are way too slow and as usual in NYC there is not enough of them. The room was very dusty - I even dusted myself and the next day, it was just as bad!. The lighting in the room is wonky - we couldn't turn off the headboard lighting and had to sleep with it on. The light on the desk turned on/off when it felt like it. Both of us felt the mattress already had a ""pit"" in the middle. A close inspection of the bathroom shows the shoddy workmanship - mortar not smoothed over properly in the shower, etc. and poor grouting of the tiles. Cleanliness was an issue - there were way too many hairs on the bathroom floor and it looked like the sink was stained. The window does not open. There were only two coat hangers in the closet. There is no iron or ironing board, just a steamer which I find generally don't work.Overall, this was a good stay, no real serious complaints but as there are so many options in this city, I'm not sure I'd stay here again unless the rate was good.",toronto,"lolabarney</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>toronto</strong>",123,4.0

Seedy section of cross street adjacent to Port Authority Terminal. Arrived about 6.30pm, homeless people and vagrants sleeping on street near hotel entrance.Hotel is adjacent to a Department of Corrections parole office with early morning lines down the street of the DCC Parole office ‘customers’....say no more as say it’s all. Not very welcoming.On check in I was advised due opening day previously no room service available. They could order me in from a deli But I’d have to pay cash....don’t travel with cash to The US aside for change for tips.Got to my ‘complimentary’ upgraded deluxe room which was the size of a postage stamp. At 6’3 I just about fitted in. Room is of course new and all fixtures and fittings very good, just can’t swing a cat in the room. Nice little mini bar with nothing in it? Asked for iron and ironing board to press shirt for following mornings meeting to be told don’t have but do have a steamer in room.....oh I laughed at the hair dryer shaped and sized machine they call a steamer that did nothing....just as well I do iron my shirts before a trip so hung up to let creases drop overnight.Let’s talk the internet that didn’t work for two days I was there? Had to use my UK data plan and connect to iPad via WiFi iPhone hotspot. Complained 1st morning and told it would be sorted that day as engineers on site. Got back from meetings at 5, went to room, no internet. Went down to complain again but told by different duty manager no issues and no one else had complained?!? Really I said....was offered a $50 F&B credit for my inconveniences so far. I changed and went down to the restaurant to get something to eat....hey it’s not open in the evening! Decided to go to rooftop bar for drink....guess what? Not open.....Got up early last day to check out at about 5.30am to avoid crowds as had business breakfast across town at 8. Check out took forever as systems weren’t working! Finally got a copy of my bill and no credit applied. Advised would be done retrospectively. Signed and left.Ultimately, appalling the services that were not available - this was not a ‘pre opening’ hotel stay - opened officially day previously....if you stay in a pre opening phase you expect things not to work or be available etc...that’s the point of a pre opening....when you open you open and expect services as advertised. Trades description springs to mind....Inconsistent staff. Lack of service, non Times Square location, tiny rooms. Once was enough for me. Hopefully when they sort their act out on services will be an acceptable tourist hotel, for the business traveller move on.","London, United Kingdom","Stevegeneux</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",139,2.0

We stayed on the 2nd official day of its opening. Angelique must be commended as she was able to rally after a co-worker gave away our balcony room after waiting 3 hours to check-in. We were still able to check-in at the advertised time of 4pm. Zachary and Nelson the two doormen were very hospitable and pleasant. The room itself was in great condition. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever experienced in a hotel. Location to Time Square and Broadway is great add-on. I will say a few minor constructive criticism would be having water readily available in the hotel. We have stayed a few times in NYC and that seems to be customary more and more. Also because the hotel just opened there was still a lot of construction happening on the floors. Either the rooms are paper thin walls or there was just so much construction. Either way it was rather noisy 8am wake-up call. I'm sure everything will work itself out though and this will become an elite hotel to stay in.","Toronto, Canada","dimascio23</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",11,4.0

Really enjoyed the elegantly decorated and immaculate clean rooms with SUPER COMFORTABLE beds. Luxurious sheets, pillows and comforters (slept beautifully and was recharged for the next day). Very thankful for the Keurig machine in the room. The marble bathrooms were filled with, great soaps, shampoo, conditioners and lotions(felt like I was in a spa with the comfy robe hotel provided and the super fluffy towels).
