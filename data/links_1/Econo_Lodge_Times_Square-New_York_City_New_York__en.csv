There are plenty of honest ways to make money, deceiving tourists isn’t one of them! When I booked I paid USD 19 extra per night to have a queen bed instead of a regular double bed.

I am wondering if prior reviewers stayed in a different type of room. It started off bad when, after many hours of travelling, we showed up to store our luggage. We were unable to even get in the front door because breakfast is served in the very tiny lobby. Also when we asked to use the restroom we were told there isn't one in the lobby and the clerk had no suggestions for me. So after you have traveled for hours there is no way to use the restroom, change or freshen up. We came back at check in time and were directed to our room. I was prepared for the size but not the condition of the room. Very dark and dated. No chair to relax on and no closet to hang our clothes. The carpet was in such bad condition and was so stained it was alarming. There were holes/ripped wallpaper on the wall. The window looked like it had never been cleaned and you could not see out of it. I walked in and turned around. There was no way I could stay in that room.

I have had an awful experience with this hotel. Yes it is in a great location but that is all it has going for it. The rooms are the most compact hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. It’s as if the room has been built around the dilapidated furniture - there is barely room to walk around the bed and my family and I booked a so called “deluxe” room on the top floor! We were only staying for 1 night and we didn’t expect luxury. I was changed $289 however £320 was taken from my credit card a full week prior to arrival. I didn’t mind this because we were going on a US road trip and I thought it was one less hotel to pay because it was prepaid before we arrived. BUT on checkin not only did they take an additional $100 from another of my credit cards (an incidental fee, supposedly), they charged me the full amount again for the room. So, a one night stay in NYC cost me £534. I queried this 2 days later with my credit card company to make sure the missing amount was pending against the Econolodge and they confirmed this was the case.We returned to NYC at the end of our 2 week holiday and needless to say, we didn’t stay in this hotel a second time but I did go back to query the double charge, to which I have yet to receive a satisfactory answer and the amount still hasn’t been put back onto my credit card - over 2 weeks after our stay!Take my advice and give this hotel a very wide berth. There are plenty of nice, clean, affordable hotels in NYC whose treatment of guests is far, far better. £534 for one night is definitely NOT acceptable - in fact we paid £600 for 3 nights in NYC at the end of our trip. We had a great time on our US road trip but having to deal with this hotel and the overcharge was a big annoyance as it meant I didn’t have the spending money I had hoped to spend on my kids.

Rooms are very small but we didn't care about that since we were out all day and basically just needed the room to change clothes and sleep. However we didn't get any sleep. The street noise was intense all night long. I obviously expect to hear some street noise as we were in the middle of NYC. However our bed could have been in the middle of the road it was so noisy. You'd swear the windows were wide open but they were not. It was loud. When I made the reservation a couple of months ago I specifically asked for a room on one of the upper floors away from the intersection to minimize the noise. We were on a higher floor when we stayed there 5 years ago and the noise wasn't as bad. But despite my request we were put in a room on the 3rd floor close to the intersection and the noise was horrible. If we were staying for more than 2 nights I would have insisted on being moved to another room up higher. If you don't get a room on an upper floor you'll need ear plugs.

Most of the employees of the front door weren’t saying Hi/Bye like in all the hotels we’ve been. Everytime I was going to them they looked they were pissed off and frustrated. I was quite scared to go and ask them something. Ok. We got on the check out day the chambermaid screaming check out at 12.00 and she keeps knocking on the door at 12.00: “check out at 12” and I was like “we are just using the toilet can we have 5more min” she keeps saying “check out at 12”. It looks like she was kicking us off. Come on! I know what hospitality means and this is not the case.

Although not as much an issue for me, my 64-year old mother wasn't thrilled about hearing the sirens (there is a fire station a block away) at all time of day and night. Second the room temperature. Since it is winter, the hotel handles the heat centrally which is a nightmare as the only way to make the room somewhat bearable is to turn on the window AC which goes back to point #1...noise. Third the staff. Although the men were very attentive and nice, there was one younger lady that refused to take clean extra linens from us and made us go back to our room and wait for someone to pick them up. This was pure non-sense for me. Fourth the breakfast. If you are debating between this and another hotel because of breakfast just pretend it is non-existent. It is basically boiled eggs, plain (not so great) bagels, little muffins and couple of cereals. Go walk a few blocks and look for egg on a roll from a food truck (at $2.50 they are a great deal). PROS: First the location. This hotel is literally 2 blocks from time square and a block from great places to eat.

Most rooms in New York City are small, we simply accepted it (how much time are you really going to spend in the room anyway). Although the hotel is clearly old, the room and bathroom were clean and we couldn’t complain - there was also free WiFi that worked well which was a bonus. The hotel staff were all very helpful and there was someone at the reception desk 24/7. There was also a 24/7 supply of teas and coffee in the reception area as well as cookies, fruit and iced water with lemon. The breakfast selection was wide - bagels, bread, pastries, boiled eggs, orange juice, cereals etc. The only downside was that we were told breakfast was available until 10am, however when going down around 9am or later there was no food left. The hotel is in the absolute perfect location if the Times Square/Hell’s Kitchen/ theatre district is where you want to be! Not even a 5 minute walk to Times Square and it’s surrounded by so many beautiful restaurants and bars. In saying that, this also means there is quite a lot of traffic noise at night time (ear plugs were already provided and in the room when we got there). If noise is something that bothers you then good luck finding somewhere central that isn’t noisy. Checkout was at 12pm which was nice considering most other places is 10am.

His description of the room, the property, it's location and the amenities is accurate so I won't repeat everything he said. Two thumbs up for his review.Two things I would add. We knew this was an Econolodge and our expectations were for an Econolodge. It was a perfectly acceptable property for a one night stay - I'm not sure if I would feel the same if we were there multiple nights. For a one night stay I would stay there again.We stayed with points and I chose the ""Queen bed efficiency"" top floor room as it was the same number of points as all the other options. This room was on the 7th floor; to get there we took the elevator to the 6th floor and had to walk up one flight of stairs. It was the only room on the 7th floor.So that anyone booking this room in the future will know, ""Efficiency"" does not mean there is anyplace to cook or prepare food. The room is slightly larger, has a sofabed that opens (although it must be a really tight squeeze if you do), and has a small, dorm sized refrigerator. A family could make do but I'd really hate to be one of two couples staying in this room.I rate the property 4 stars because, well, it is an Econolodge. Great location, great value, I slept well, there was hot water and clean towels, the morning coffee in the lobby was passable and all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.

I could compare this because after I'd checked out and left my bags with reception, we asked to use a restroom before we left for the airport and the helpful reception staff allowed us the use of a regular room. I'd also asked for a quiet room and I was allocated room 500 which was furthest away from 8th Ave but next to the elevator.

The room itself had clean linen and towels, and housekeeping did a good job.

The location was probably the best part of this hotel, you're gonna be within steps of times square & the Port Authority. The noise level, is loud! But ear plugs were provided in our room upon checking in. Consider the fact that most of your vacation you'll be outside exploring & by the time you return to your hotel, you'll be too tired to really notice the outside noise. If you're a light sleeper however, this may not be the place for you.The price is a great bargain considering where you're at. Steps away from major attractions & train stations to go out further. This is NYC and with that, space is at a premium. If you want a bigger room, you're gonna have to pay more.I do feel that the decor in the hotel is in need of a major overhaul, it's outdated & it shows throughout.

It was slightly better laid out and a bit bigger so we opted to switch rooms.If we hadn't we would have checked out and gone elsewhere!The 5th floor room was a bit better but was tired and dated. Not cleaned to the best standard, worn chipped furniture, scuffed walls, stuff (???) stuck on the dated carpets in places and splashed paint elsewhere on the floors and walls as there had been some DIY done to try and patch up the room. The bathroom was really dated, tiled floor was not exactly clean and cracked in places which could have cut your feet. Shower was really of a poor standard and you could not really adjust the shower-head so the water almost came out and hit the far wall. Bath and tiles were tired and there was lots of mould which as not pleasant. You also have no control of the heating in the room which is an antiquated old hot air heating system. So the room gets really warm and not pleasant if you've just been for a shower. We're we're not here in Spring or Summer so can imagine the heat in these rooms could be an issue as the fan system built into the window is fairly useless. The room does get really noisy! Partly because there is a Fire Station just across the junction at 47th and 8th. But even 5 flights up you can hear people in the street as there is an inner window, and a different outer window. Why the whole window could have not been replaced at some point is just cheap! Lots of drafts coming in around the window which you do have to open to vent the room.Other things we could mention was work getting done in adjoining rooms, emergency exits certainly on 3rd and 5th were partially blocked with paint tins, lights, tools, rubbish and other obstructions. At least there were no emergencies when we stayed.Generally staff were friendly and breakfast although okay was fairly basic.We have stayed at other Choice Hotels but found this one somewhat over-rated and in need of a general over haul, ""refurb"", and spring clean.",UK,"forsyb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>UK</strong>",41,3.0

The Econo Lodge Times square takes it to a whole new level. One side of the queen bed in our room was only about 13 inches from the radiator projecting from the wall. The end of the bed was about 9 or 10 inches from another wall. You had to inch sideways to get past the end of the bed to the far side. A small wardrobe took up most of the space on the other side of the bed. The narrow entryway was partially obstructed by a desk and chair which couldn’t be used without blocking access to the room door. Another odd feature of the room was a window air conditioner positioned behind the curtain so that you had the choice of a dark hot room or a cooler room brightly lit by outdoor lighting. The overall feeling of the room was uncomfortable and possibly dangerous. In our room, the air conditioner emitted a frequent spray of tiny water droplets. The bathroom door hinge made a squeal that was loud and sounded like a human cry – not so nice to hear in the middle of the night. The hot water would sometimes run cold briefly. Even on the upper floors, the street noise was more than is common in other NYC hotels. The staff were nice, the room and hotel were reasonably clean and the bed was semi comfortable but the size of the room and issue with the layout of the curtain and air conditioner made it a poor choice for a stay in NYC.

We visited 3 of them and they were great. ( a little advice if you go there, head towards 9th avenue for a lot better, choice, price and quality food)The breakfast at the hotel is just what you need to set yourself up for the day , light but filling. There is always coffee, tea, water etc available at reception to take away or drink there , and cookies in the afternoon.There's only one ""bad"" thing at the hotel and that's nothing to do with hotel. But expect a lot of noise 24 hours a day. Police, fire engines, taxi etc.... all day long.

Location is hard to beat, tons of things to do within easy walking distance. The staff is friendly as others have pointed out. The beds are comfortable and the shower was powerful. However, I have stayed here twice now and I never plan to return. When people say the rooms are small they are actually being generous. Imagine a bed that extends nearly from wall to wall. It is actually impossible to walk around the bottom of the bed from the far side to reach the bathroom. You can see the floor, but the gap is only about 8 inches so a sideways shuffle is required. To make a little room on the near side, we moved the chair from the table and set it by the entry door so we wouldn't hit it every time we moved. We were only spending one night so we elected to live out of our suitcase (overhead carryon size) and having it open used about one-third of the available floor space. But the problem that really made it impossible to return again was the heat. There does not appear to be any available temperature control. There is an air conditioner with a remote control that might be useful in the summer, but nothing for the winter to allow us some control. And the room gets HOT. In the morning, we propped open our door to get cool air in from the hallway so that we could stand it. Overall, the shortcomings are just too large for me to return, the real geographic advantages just don't compensate for what seems like living in a hot jail cell, albeit one with a comfortable bed.","Dayton, Maryland","Auerbachs1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dayton, Maryland</strong>",45,3.0

Our first trip alone in 10 years! Location was excellent in regards to Times Square, 5th Ave shopping and Broadway shows. We didn't have time to do any sightseeing, as we went to a hockey game at Madison Square Garden (still not too far of a walk for being 7 months pregnant!), three Broadway shows and shopped the rest of the time. They gave me the room on the highest floor they had, provided ear plugs (which are actually quite helpful for the noise--can't be helped being so close to all the action--but not too close that we were right within all the noise), the room and bathroom were clean and the staff were genuinely kind and excellent. Upon check-in, we had Jazmine and she was the sweetest and kindest person who's ever served me. We had another guy the next morning who helped us with restaurant suggestions, but I can't remember his name (started with P) and he was very nice, too. The girl we had when we left was also very sweet. Even though the room didn't have a fridge, Jazmine told me that we could have just called the hotel directly to request that one be put in our room and that we could still do that at anytime for no charge. We didn't end up needing one, but good to know for the future in case we come back and need to store baby food or milk. There's a convenience store ""Duane Reade"" right across the street on the corner for any late night needs (we got a 3L bottle of water for $1.79 and yogurt twice). The fresh fruit (all day) and cookies were a nice late night treat (one night--we missed the other nights). I had originally picked this place due to price, location and the fact it included breakfast, but I slept in everyday past 9am (a real treat after all the walking) and breakfast is over at 9am during the week (10am in weekends, but we were there during the week.). I usually had a piece of fruit in the room with me, so it wasn't a big deal, but it was a great option to at least know there was food there if we got up in time. Many hotels don't have breakfast included. Wi-fi worked great (some hotels don't have wireless wi-fi). Phone calls to the US and Canada were free from our room, so the first night we actually called home to Canada from the room. We left our luggage to be stored for a couple hours the day we checked out so we could take in more of Times Square before we left. We would definitely stay there again!

This was an awful, stressful start to our holiday as our plans for that night and the next morning were in the Times Square area. Also annoyed that the first I had to hear about it was from the receptionist despite them having my email address. We rejigged our itinerary and went up the ESB that evening instead of what we initially had planned. The hotel we were moved to, The Paul, more than made up for the trauma of being unexpectedly relocated: we had an awesome view of the ESB from our bedroom window, a spacious room with a big, modern bathroom and a sumptuous hot buffet breakfast. We were hesitant to leave to check into Econo Lodge the next morning for fear it wouldn't be on par. It wasn't, alas. No view to speak of from our room, the room was a bit too small for two of us and our luggage, and the street noise was very loud at night, despite being on the third floor and using the ear plugs provided. We were given 20% off our first night, which was appreciated. The breakfast area was too small and often hard to find a place to sit and eat. Breakfast was not the awesome bacon and scrambled eggs we were treated to at The Paul - another disappointment, but we were prepared for it knowing that it was only a continental breakfast included. Amusingly, this review would probably be a lot more positive if we weren't inconvenienced and sent off in a taxi to a more awesome hotel for our first night. After that, it's hard not to draw comparisons. On the plus side, some of the staff went out of their way to make us feel valued and it is in an excellent location.

Overall, we had a comfortable, safe and clean experience. This is definitely a budget-hotel with very few frills; however, it suited my needs perfectly. The hotel entrance is not directly on 8th and is on a quieter street, which I really appreciated. You can see they care for their property from the pretty plants outside and welcoming atmosphere. I arrived very early on my first day due to a red-eye from the West Coast. The receptionist was very friendly, and while she couldn't accommodate an early check-in, she did give us cold water bottles and invited us to have breakfast which was going on in the lobby at the time. She offered to hold our luggage, gave us directions for some places to explore in the area while we were waiting, and then even personally called me when our room was ready to let us know we could come check in. The room itself was comfortable, clean and QUIET. Our room was right on the end by the elevator and we never heard anything! (Of course, it is near Times Square in NYC, so the street can be a bit loud from the window, but that's Times Square, people.) If you looked too deeply, you can see where there had been places where the walls had been repaired or there were dirt smudges on the wall that had been cleaned. However - this is to be expected, and you can see that the hotel staff had worked to fully repair and clean the area. Very clean bathroom, which is important to me. We had a Queen Deluxe room, and it was incredibly small (as are all hotels in NYC, to be honest). The room comes with a mini-fridge, small desk, armoire, flat-screen TV and air-conditioning. No closet. The bathroom was spacious for a room of that size, too. Not too many towels, but we called down and asked for more and they brought some up right away. I felt very safe the entire time I was there as well.Very few amenities, however, they do offer breakfast in the morning. Pretty standard European-style breakfast - pastries, coffee, fruit, cereal, etc. They also have hard-boiled eggs and some ham and cheese. Right across the street on 8th is a great cafe with breakfast sandwiches, though, so just go there!TIPS:-There's a great grocery store on 8th Ave about 3 blocks up. Stock up on snacks and store in your mini-fridge to avoid NYC food-markup!-Wake up early and stroll through Times Square before everyone wakes up. Most stores open at 8am, and you can beat the crowds.-The concierge was really nice! Just ask for what you need and they'll help you.-The ice machine is downstairs in the lobby!-Only 1 elevator for the entire hotel, so make sure you leave some time for that (or just take the stairs)-They do offer WiFi and it was so strong that I was able to walk down to the corner of 8th and Facetime with my family to show them where I was!Honestly, it was perfect for what I wanted and needed (my fiance and I attending a conference together in Times Square) but I think a family or two friends would be really tight in these rooms. If it's your first time in NYC, it can be fun to be so close to the action, but you might also stay uptown for a bit more space and peace if you aren't used to the city and don't just want to be in Times Square.","Seattle, Washington","ohheyitsk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",11,4.0

The bathroom had basic toiletries – shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, as well as two sets of ear plugs. The TV was propped up on one of the corners of the room. The bed was very comfortable.What I love about the Econolodge is the location. It's central and close to everything.

One of us had to stand on the bed to get changed because there physically wasn't enough floor space for the 2 of us to dress. The hotel also failed to mention that a $100 safety deposit is required which took us by surprise on arrival as we had not budgeted for this, and being two young girls on an average wage, definitely felt the absence in our spending money, even though we did get it back on the last day. Another thing was our room was literally just across the road from the fire station and while earphones were provided, we were still awoken many times during the night with sirens going off practically next door. The staff were not rude or abrupt but were also not particularly friendly or helpful. Just neutral. My friend and I ate cold breakfast 4/5 mornings because your staff didn't mention there was an option to toast things behind the desk and only found out due to another customer requesting so.

The reason it is so awesome is the location combined with the pricing. It is literally one block away from Times Square, which means it is pretty much a walking distance from almost all of the tourist spots in Manhattan. Also, it was about 60% of the price of other hotels we looked at in Manhattan. We were there for 3 days and 2 nights and ended up benefitting from the close proximity on all 3 days - each day we made a quick stop back at the hotel in the evening for a couple of hours of rest before heading back out at night; which I doubt we would have been able to do had we stayed in say, Brooklyn. It is also just a 10 minute walk away from the inter-state bus station (PATH).The staff was very courteous as well. They let us keep our bags at the front desk on the third day after our checkout, and even let us use the restroom of one of the unoccupied rooms after we finished sightseeing on the third day, before we had to catch our bus out of New York. This effectively ended up saving us an extra day of booking, since we were leaving New York in the evening and did not have to carry our bags with us on the last day's sightseeing, and since it was so close to the bus stop and most tourist spots, we didn't waste much time in going back to the hotel to pick up our bags.Like some other reviewers mentioned, the rooms are in fact small, but we didn't mind that one bit, since we just needed a place to rest, and the location, service and rates offered by this hotel allowed us to have a wonderful stay in New York.

Times square was 2 blocks, a Duane Reade and Starbucks across the street. I walked to all of the theaters I had tickets to. It is in a very safe area and in the heart of the theater district. They also had a small continental breakfast which consisted of hard boiled eggs, choice of cereals, bananas, apples, toast, baked goods. They even got me a cereal that was gluten free upon request. They always had ice water, coffee, and fruit out for your taking throughout the day. There is free wi-fi which is a bonus in Nyc. I arrived early and sat in the lobby for 3 hours. They did their best to get me a room as soon as one becomes available. Please note: there is no bathroom in the small lobby. Sometimes if they are not booked they have a room available for the bathroom. This was somewhat of an inconvenience but I just went across the street to Starbucks. The elevators are very slow. The rooms can be noisy (they provide earplugs). I wanted to take a nap before a show on the first day around 3 or 4, but it was too loud with trucks, sirens, etc. even with earplugs. I also asked for a room not facing 8th ave as that is the loudest. The other mornings were o.k. except when they were patching the street right in front of the hotel. I would suggest asking for a higher up room, not facing 8th. Just be prepared for a looong elevator wait. Oh, also there is only an ice machine in the lobby which was a pain for me. Now for the room. It was very clean. I was by myself or else I would have no idea how 2 ppl would fit. There was not enough room to even walk around the bed, you can do it but is VERY tight. Your legs would be touching wall and bed trying to squeeze by. I have stayed in small NYC hotel rooms, read reviews for this hotel, but never expected it to be this size. If you have a problem with small enclosed spaces, I would not recommend this hotel. I might stay here again if I get a good deal like I did last time.

Called late Friday night to ask what time our check in was. Explained we would be arriving early and were told we could leave our luggage at the front desk until check in at 3:00. Called early Saturday morning while on our way to double check that we were booked for a stay. Showed up and were greeted followed by ""there's a bit of an issue"". The issue was that we supposedly didn't CONFIRM our reservation before 8am. They booked our room for someone else. Yet, econo lodge took it upon themselves to book a room for us at a boutique hotel 20 minutes away. The entire reason we booked the time square location was for convenience. It does not make sense to me to use the excuse of we didn't think you were coming because you didn't confirm, yet we booked you a room with another hotel. Bottom line is that was an excuse. Nobody told or mentioned to us that a confirmation was needed the two times that we called only hours before we were expected. The front desk receptionist kept asking us ""what would you like me to do"". That was a bit irritating. Luckily we found a room at the Westin with a much better location, much better atmosphere and environment for only $60 more. We asked the front desk receptionist to cancel everything and release our holds for the security deposit, since we were going to stay elsewhere.  To top it all off on Sunday when we were getting ready to check out and pay I checked my bank account and Econo Lodge had charged me for the rooms that we didn't even stay in!!!!! I cannot express my full frustration with them through words.

Breakfast is included. It consisted of two choices of cereal, different pastries, cakes, cheeses, bread and fresh fruit, I am a really healthy eater, so didn't eat breakfast here. There is tea, coffee, water and fresh fruit available 24 hours a day. I was able to refill my water bottle and take some fresh fruit out with me each day.

I knew it was not going to be 5 star as the price reflected that, it can be very expensive in some of the large chain hotels in NY. Firstly I want to say how clean this place is I am fussy about that sort of thing and found Econo Lodge spotless. The sheets and towels were clean and the bathroom spotless none of that mould around the grouting as you sometimes see. The Housekeepers made the room up daily and you could get clean towels or a change of sheets by leaving a card on the bed. The room is very small but adequate for me as I was travelling alone, there is a double bed but I did wonder how you get two suitcases in the room and two people would struggle to hang up clothes in the minute wardrobe. I was there to sightsee so lived out of my suitcase which fitted on the luggage rack supplied. I suppose two people would need to put the suitcases on top of each other. The room is a bit dated and tired looking but if you are only there to sleep this is not much of a problemThe facilities are good, free WiFi which is really unusual in NY and also a free buffet breakfast which is also rare in NY hotels. It consisted of the same stuff every day. eggs, cheese, ham, fruit, bagels, choice of cereals and pastries,and fruit juice, sometimes it was impossible to find somewhere to sit to eat it so I took it to the room probably at least three of the days I was there. Also very welcome was the constant supply of tea and coffee in the reception area, I found the de caff coffee ok and it saved me money on buying coffee. The staff are very helpful and answered my questions about directions and queries well, the maintenance man was also helpful, my telephone was not working so they offered me a late checkout as compensation which was nice. The shower had hot water every day and the room has a wall mounted TV with a limited amount of channels. There are points to charge, laptops and phones.Now the not so good bits - I know this is not the hotels fault but it is situated right on Times Square it is noisy all the time not only with traffic but people swearing and shouting, the location is fantastic and I was able to walk everywhere easily, but I did need the ear plugs which are in the room to sleep especially the first couple of nights, I did find leaving the TV on helped to block out some of the noise and made it easier to fall asleep. I realised just before I left that the hotel does have white noise machines which you can request. The problem is that the windows are not fully double glazed and I can see why as this leads me to the other issue - heating. There are no heating controls in the room - it is either on or off - when I arrived the room was like a sauna and I could not work out how to open the window and had a really bad nights sleep. The maintenance man opened the window for me and for reference you need to stand on the window ledge and pull the top section down (this is the bit that is not double glazed) Once I knew this it was much nicer in the room. If you ask at reception they do turn the heating off but then the room can get cold - its a difficult balance as you cant really control it. Secondly the curtains do not fit correctly and the gaps can let in some light this didn't really bother me but it could others.Overall I would stay here again, it was a good price for NY, the breakfast and great location all were important for me. Please don't expect luxury as you wont find that here but if you are going to be out and about all day and not in the room other than to sleep I would recommend it.

On check out the lady on the front desk looked after my bags for the day so I didn't have to carry them around before being picked up from the hotel she let me use one of the rooms to get sorted for my flight home which was very helpful. overall I was expecting a corporate average which I would of been happy with but my experience was more than I could of expected and very helpful and people I met saying In another hotel told me they didn't even get wifi in there rooms.

We had gotten there too early to check in so the front desk attendant was very helpful in getting our bags checked while we wandered the city. We actually came back to grab a few things and she was nice enough to let my mother use a bathroom from a room who had been recently been vacated. We got through the check in process pretty quickly and upon stepping into the elevator that is when I knew we were in trouble. Run down and ridiculously slow. Got to the room and immediately regretted everything. The room was no more than 300 sq. feet. Bathroom was a an okay size but you can tell this was a renovated apartment building. But to the most important part: YOU CANNOT CONTROL THE THERMOSTAT. You are forced to call the front desk who wasn't helpful at that point since the heat was still somewhere in the 70s. So then we opened the window. To which we were met with a barrage of swear words and racist slurs; among the group not directed toward us. I'm not unaccustomed to such behavior however, when trying to nap after a red eye flight, I was beyond displeased. So we closed the window and turned on the air conditioner. MISTAKE. It was extremely loud and with how small the room was, it became freezing so at least that functioned just not the way we needed it to. Moreover, it was probably a fire hazard that the cord drapes over the heater but at that point we were over it.I understand cancellation policies but at the front desk we were met with, ""My manager is on the phone and she'll be busy. I can't refund your second night."" Excuse me? We're a customer with an issue that you can't solve, so get your manager. Ridiculous. The manager did refund our second night and at that point we were willing to pay to not stay at this hotel and opted for a $50/more room at the Marriott a few blocks up. 2 hours for $99.

It really doesn't get much more central than this - one block east to 7th Ave @ Times Square, 3 blocks to a small subway Station (50th St), and 5 blocks to one of the biggest stations in New York (42nd St). There's nowhere in the whole of the 5 boroughs that you can't easily connect to from Econo Lodge2) Cleanliness - the hotel was clean and well-presented throughout. Housekeeping was undertaken daily3) Staff - we didn't need their assistance much, but they were nevertheless friendly and helpful4) Wifi - free, fast and reliable5) Breakfast - very basic (we only ate it once), but FREE. Guests can also help themselves to tea and coffee 24/7Cons:1) Size of rooms - FAR too small, even by budget NYC standards. Even though we only used the room to shower and sleep, it was still uncomfortably small for two adults. For example, there was nowhere to store a suitcase without tripping over it (we had to place it on top of the wardrobe), and you can't walk around the bed without doing a little shuffle in the process. If you're planning on doing a lot of shopping in NYC, leave it until the end of your trip, because you'll have nowhere to store it in Econo Lodge!2) Heating - the rooms (including bathroom) are way too hot. Heating is controlled centrally, so you have no control over the heating in your own room, meaning that two radiators to heat one very small room and one small bathroom are almost always ON. This created a stuffy and dry atmosphere, even though it was very cold outdoors. The small aircon unit did very little to combat the intense heat from the radiators. I did ask for the heating to be turned down a little, but it wasn't done.3) Noise and light - I'm not a novice NYC visitor. I know that it's very noisy almost 24/7. However, I've stayed at other Times Square hotels which manage to cut out the noise a LOT better (i.e. by having decent windows). The old-fashioned features of Econo Lodge mean that the building is quite ill-equipped to filter out most street noise. Being only a few steps away from busy 8th Ave, be prepared to get very little sleep (the hotel provides earplugs for this reason, but they can't fully block out NYC sirens and car honks). As for light - the curtains aren't long enough, so leave a 6-inch gap between curtain and ledge, into which sunlight streams early every morning :(I'm a lover of budget and mid-range hotels. My basic criteria is 'bed, shower, toilet', and I don't expect much more than that. However, Econo Lodge was TOO small (coming from someone who only ever books small, basic rooms), and the heating issue made my stay quite uncomfortable.Unfortunately, I wouldn't stay again. Only the location and the good price saved the day.",England,"JK49</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>England</strong>",108,3.0

We arrived at jfk airport and taxi's to the hotel cost $69 this is a fixed rate but please note they can only take 4 passengers. We went with another couple and a friend and we're staying in new York for 5 days.The trip to the hotel took 45 mins. Traffic is chaos. Please note driving in new York looks terrifying and you need to be very experienced if you want to take that on. To describe the hotel well I would compare it to a travel lodge in the U.K. Checkin was quick but please note there is a $100 deposit. PAY CASH (due to issues I had with my credit card) The rooms are very small and we had a room with 2 double beds in it but they are tidy and fit for purpose sleeping. The hotel do supply ear plugs you will need them. New York at any time of the day is busy and very noisy.. The room has air con and isn't controlled by the hotel it is very cold but noisy so if your a light sleeper this place will not be for you. The room has a safe and the hotel provided bottled water. Now to talk location well that for me wins it. The hotel is a 5 min walk into the heart of time squarely is close to subway stations and close to many of the big attractions. Very morning between 6am and 9am they do provide a continental breakfast pastries,fruit,coffee tea juice etc very nice little addition to the very good hotel.The hotel does look dated and the lift isn't the best but overall this is a great hotel.

The room was adequate for this purpose. My room was fine for a solo traveler, but if I were traveling with a companion I would pay for a larger room. This time it was ok for a comfortable bed and a shower for the night.The room had most of what a guest needs on a short stay, including a hairdryer and an iron for pressing clothes. Space is very limited, bu the furniture is equally compact to fit the space. The bed was very comfortable. My room had a window overlooking the street, instead of a brick wall. The room was clean enough (the sheets appeared clean, but I did see a couple of tiny stains of something). The bed was made without bedspreads, and that is always preferable to me because I strongly dislike hotel bedspreads that are never clean. The bathroom was tiny, but clean with excellent water pressure and temperature. Other guests who have stayed here have mentioned that it's noisy. The hotel provides foam earplugs, but I didn't need to use them and I slept undisturbed.There is a tiny reception area where a continental breakfast is served early in the morning. Hard boiled eggs, some cheese and salami cuts; sliced bread (no toaster), croissants, sweet pastries, butter and jam; coffee and juice. I had time to sit with a cup of coffee and a pastry and leisurely read the newspaper before I checked out before 8 a.m. Overall I will give this stay a Happy Face. I had a nice bed for the night, a private bathroom, and coffee and pastries for breakfast before checking out. Location in midtown Manhattan is great for easy subway transportation, and the price was right to fit my budget. And by the way, I appreciated having a bible in the dresser drawer.

Yes, the rooms are tiny. But we would rather spend our money on food and entertainment than on a room we are only going to be in while sleeping!Pros:1. Location: It would be impossible to be closer to Times Square for this price. Even some of the more expensive hotels aren't as conveniently located. At 47th and 8th, this hotel is one block west of Times Square. So while there is a lot of street noise, it's considerably less than it would be to be closer to 7th or Broadway. Access to a number of subway stations servicing a variety of lines is easy and convenient.2. Free breakfast: This was a huge pro for us. It was nice to be able to get up, grab our coffee and breakfast in the lobby, and bring it back up to our room where we could get ready and discuss our itinerary for the day while having a munch. It was nice not having to think about what to do/where to go for breakfast - we could just fuel up and get on our way. Even the breakfast food itself was better than expected - the boiled eggs, meat, and cheese were a pleasant surprise, in addition to the usual fruit/pastry/yogurt continental breakfast fare. They even changed the weekend breakfast hours after receiving feedback that the weekend hours were too early, and informed us of the change on Friday.3. Staff: The staff were super pleasant and helpful. When we arrived early (well before the check-in time), they got our paperwork started, took our bags, and encouraged us to go grab lunch and get our bearings. This is what we'd planned on doing anyway, but I guess they must get so many people doing this exact thing that they've really got the process streamlined. Checkout was also quick and easy.Cons:1. Wifi: The wifi wasn't really working while we were there. My husband and I were able to connect one device each (my phone, his tablet), but after that we were unable to get his and my tablet phone online, when we should have been able to connect up to 8 devices. I don't think it was *really* working properly on the devices we DID have - the two devices we were able to connect didn't even need the username/password we were provided. The next day, there was a notice posted in the hallway that the wifi was down but that they'd called a technician to address the issue. So while it was inconvenient, the hotel staff were very quick to act and to communicate the issue with guests. 2. Decor is dated: We have stayed in small hotels before, and even the smallest room can be improved by updated, tasteful decor. The lobby definitely gives a more updated impression, but the rooms could really use some love. Overall: We would absolutely stay here again. We are fairly low maintenance travelers who would prefer, when forced with the choice, to eat and drink in nice restaurant and bars, and stay in a budget hotel. This hotel was 100% comfortable and had everything we needed and more for a 4 night stay.","Newfoundland, Canada","Allison O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newfoundland, Canada</strong>",21,4.0

The air conditioner in the room was not good. It was blowing cool air but the room was hot, not uncomfortable but hot. Even with the window open I could not make the room get cool. The second and funny thing was check in. They take your credit card and use the old paper slide imprint machine to get your number. Yeah it works but that it so last century get with the times. I felt like I was back in the 80's. That said if the room was able to be cooled it would be ideal for the solo traveler. 2 people in that room may have been uncomfortable.

Clean if somewhat worn, comfortable bed, very friendly and accommodating staff both at the desk and tending the rooms, free safe in the room, decent & filling complementary breakfast. Free internet - the savings on breakfast & internet alone will give you money to spend on fun stuff! And location is the reason you're staying here - short walk away from Times square, theaters, restaurants, subway.

The staff were as good as expected and the location to Times Square was ideal for our trip. The included breakfast was good and wifi was included. We asked the staff about finding a pub which showed the 6 nations rugby and within about an hour they were knocking our room door with a 3 page print out of the pubs that might show it with descriptions and contacts for each around Manhattan. The room was clean and functional and if you arrange your luggage well the small size of the room can be managed. This is the only reason I have scored a 4 for room comfort. The location to Times Square means that your not going to get the quietest night sleep due to horns and sirens going through the night. For me this added to the experience of staying in New York and as the bed was so comfortable it was easy to drift in and out of sleep when I wasn't going to the window to see what was going on. For me this offered an ideal location and excellent service. If you can overlook the small room and live with the noise at night then you can't go wrong, particularly at the excellent rates they charge.

The staff were always pleasant, I was always greeted whilst exiting and entering the hotel. Typical New York sized rooms on level 5, basically a shoebox in a nutshell but I've come to expect nothing less in NYC on a budget however if I was traveling in a party of two, it would have been a challenge to store multiple cases etc. The room contained a desk which in my opinion was a space waster, I had to turn sideways to walk past the desk/chair to my bathroom. I was provided a mini fridge at no extra charge which was appreciated despite adding even less space to the room, small price to pay for the ability to store food etc. My only complaint would be the heating system, each floor is controlled by management and temperature regulation was a problem for me and caused some discomfort. At times my room was unbearably hot to the point of needing a cool shower in the middle of a NY winter night and other times it was too cold. I did not like this feature at all and would much prefer being able to regulate my own heating/cooling settings. I cannot imagine how there could be a happy medium for all guests using the current system. Other then that - location, location, location is the highlight, friendly and accommodating staff, comfortable bed, decent WIFI and affordable for someone traveling on a budget.

Incredibly nice and welcoming staff (every single staff member infact) the hotel is clean and the WiFi worked all of the time with good signal. We were on the 6th (top) floor in room 610.

The shower was easy to use and the bathroom spotless everyday. The free continental breakfast was always varied and well stocked and gave us many a wonderful day in New York City off to a great start. Check out time is 12pm but our flight wasn't until late night and the staff were so helpful and let us leave our cases behind the desk in the lobby until later on so we could have a full day out before leaving.

We were told the room we booked that morning would be ready at 3, but were able to check out of our other “hotel” and check in far earlier. When we checked out, they also allowed us to leave our bags in the hotel until it was time for us to leave for the airport. Oscar then arranged a cab for us which we thought at first was taking us on a creative route to LaGuardia, but actually got us there in good time and for less than a shuttle would have cost.

It is considerably cheaper than any other hotel in the area. But there's a reason for that. The rooms are unbelievably small - especially the ones for over 3 people. There was absolutely no place for our luggage. Wherever we put it, we would block a door or make it difficult for us to go to the bathroom or something. And the room was not well cleaned. Three days after our arrival, we found a bottle of beer under our bed – obviously not ours. We left it there to see if the maid would pick it up and throw it away. We stayed there for nine days. The bottle stayed longer. Upsides: breakfast is decent, front desk staff is helpful, and, of course, location, location, location.

For the price we paid though (under two hundred a night in Sept.) this was a very good find. Now on to the specifics...Pros: the hotel was an excellent price for the location (one block off of Times Square) and walking distance to many other major attractions plus it was about a block from the subway so you could get everywhere else, the room was clean and looks like it had been slightly refurbished at some point in the not too distant past, there was a free continental breakfast provided, the staff were very pleasant and helpful, and they stored our suitcase for us for free on our checkout date until it was time for us to leave the city. Con: the mattress was the most uncomfortable one that my husband and I have ever slept on. We woke up both days with a sore back (and we are only in our early 30's - this shouldn't be happening to us yet!). I don't know if it was just our room, or if all their mattresses are that uncomfortable, but it was bad enough for us to knock down the overall rating of this property to four stars (would have given it five - considering all that we got for the small price we paid - if we had a semi-comfortable mattress). Other people have noted cons re: the small room size and the noise of the traffic keeping them up at night. Since we only used our room to sleep and shower, the room size wasn't an issue for us. Additionally, since we live in a large city - okay a suburb of a large city - the noise wasn't bothersome at all.

This was our third time in Manhattan and I can say with certainty that the hotel was the best we have ever stayed there. The location is outstanding (one block from Times Square), next to the Broadway theater area. Those who enjoy (and have fitness) can explore the island on foot. Or use one of several subway lines with stations nearby. The hotel is small (56 rooms), thus quieter than those which receive tourists groups. The rooms are really small, which certainly is a disadvantage to anyone going to NY to shop or having a lot of luggage. As it was not our case, and as I have made the reservation straight with the hotel by email, I could choose a larger room (DeLuxe) with fridge, ironing board and iron, plus amenities like hair dryer, flat screen TV and wi-fi with reasonable speed. We were on the fifth floor and had no problem with noise from the street, elevator or other rooms. Bed, mattress and pillows very good which, added to the fatigue of walking all day, ensured a perfect sleep.The cooled air worked perfectly. The bathroom has both tub and shower and the temperature as well as the water pressure is adequate for a good bath. Cleanliness is impeccable and bedding and bath, white and spotless. If you want your linens changed daily, just leave on the bed a tag that can be found in the room, on the information directory.The staff is top notch. I specially mention Linda, Vanessa, Jessica and Oscar, who we have talked most with, but all without exception are extremely kind, friendly and attentive. The breakfast also deserves praise, especially due to the difficulty in finding a hotel in NY with breakfast included in the rate. It is rich and varied (fruits, juices, yogurts, cereals, bagels, pastries and savory breads, cheeses and cold meats, boiled eggs) far better than we have had in other hotels we had ever stayed. It can be taken in the lobby (for this is advisable to go down early because there are only five tables) or grabbed it and get to take in the room. Throughout the day, coffee, tea and hot chocolate in the lobby are at guests' disposal. In 10 days we found nothing that discredit this hotel. The only ""but"" is the lack of a toilet in the lobby to serve guests who need to stick around prior to the check-in (15h) and after check-out (12h). To sum up, I regard the daily rate fully compatible with the hotel location and the standard of services offered.","Sao Paulo, SP","Francisco M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sao Paulo, SP</strong>",0,5.0

Ever in the history of my life! ha! Yes, as you have read the room is tiny. I've been to NYC several times and this is the smallest I've stayed in. Now, who really cares about the size? I suppose if you are in NYC to hang out in your room this may not be an option but I can tell you I slept better and more comfortably in this room than any other time I've been to NYC. The room and tiny bathroom are the cleanest I've seen. The bed was extremely comfortable even though I shared it with my adult niece because of my own error in booking a room with 2 beds. But we both slept great with comfortable sheets, pillows and quilt. No yucky bedspreads to deal with either... just white lines and quilt. The walls are boring and for the most part bare (but too small for too much.. ha). But again, we didn't stay here to look at walls. We were on the second floor and directly across the street was a bar. There was some noise but the air conditioner was a little loud but steady which drowned out almost all street noise. Speaking of air conditioners... we turned ours on when we checked in and hit the streets to sight see. When we returned the room was still hot. Within a minute of calling the front desk someone was there to fix it. When it was discovered that the de-icing would take too long they immediately had key cards in hand for another room! (No such luck in getting lucky on a room with two beds). They offered to move us but it was right next door and easy enough for us to do in less than 5 minutes. So, the hotel staff are extremely courteous, always smiling and very helpful!!! There is a free breakfast, just fruit, cheese, yogurt, rolls with juice and coffee. Just easy grab and go stuff. Step outside the hotel and you are in walking distance (easy walking) to Broadway shows and Times Square. We walked everywhere even to Rockefeller Center and to Central Park. (Central Park may be considered too far for some but we walked everywhere!). Now, look left when you walk out the hotel door... you will see a row of apartments on a fairly quiet street which is nice. There are restaurants and bakeries, laundry facilities, Starbucks, Duncan Donut with a bit of a slower pace. With the great location, super friendly and helpful staff and a clean and comfortable room and quieter area I will never again book elsewhere when visiting NYC!","Pfafftown, North Carolina","Millie0702</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pfafftown, North Carolina</strong>",35,4.0

Based on the level of service provided here, I expect that there would be even more options if they had the space because they do seem to want to take care of their guests - they are just very limited on the space available for items. Even on just the two mornings we were there, there was at least a little variety in what was offered (though if you want something above just a continental breakfast, there are plenty of great places to eat nearby).The rooms were clean and well-kept. The only issue is, as many reviewers have noted, the size. That is obviously nothing that the hotel or the staff can do anything about and they make good use of what space they have available. However, I cannot imagine staying here for an entire week as I think I would become claustrophobic. Just a couple of days was great though. With two people in the room, one basically had to take turns sitting on the bed while the other moved around and then switch. It can also get a little loud as the rooms are street-side, but the hotel does provide ear plugs in the rooms if you need them.If you need somewhere clean, friendly, and excellently located and do not have hundreds of dollars to spend each night on the room, this Econo Lodge is a great option.

The room was a little smaller than expected but for my budget sufficed for my needs. My requirements: inexpensive in a safe neighborhood with a close walk to the train station. I had to sign up for the choice rewards to get a discount on the room but I was able to book the room for 150ish per night which was better than my AAA discount.... The staff was friendly, the room (however very small like really small) was clean, and we are only a few blocks from pretty much anything. The only thing kind of rough other than the room size with the Hotel here is the Wifi speed is pretty slow but it is way better than internet speeds while roaming with my smartphone( kept cutting in an out on my MBpro)... The room came with a TV (19-24 inch didn't even turn it on). There is a lot to do in NYC and the Trip advisor app for your smart phone is kind of a must. The staff suggested a few things to do for us while my girlfriend and I stayed here as well. We were going to do the on and off bus tour but ended up just getting the metro card for a week (about 30 each and just made out own the tour ourselves) I would stay here again but like I said the wifi is pretty bad; I had to refresh the page here about 3 times before I could submit it. The bathroom was clean with fresh towels but the bathtub ( could be my imagination) seemed shorter than a normal bathtub(could have been my imagination). The breakfast got the job done for me with Bagels, cereal and boiled eggs peeled pop tarts and coffee and some cheese and meat slices was perfect for a light breakfast. With everything said and done I saved myself at least 400$ staying here rather than somewhere else. I got a 20% off discount for my next stay: (Thanks to the awesome staff at the front desk) I can deal with that. Next time I roll through NYC I'll stay here again.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin","kingofrandom92</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milwaukee, Wisconsin</strong>",0,3.0

To clarify what ""cramped"" means.... there was less than a foot bwt the bottom of the bed and the wall -- which required either walking sideways / or climbing over the bed - to get to the other side. Apparently, for more $$$ you can get a room where it is possible to walk around the bed, but we didn't want to spend more $ on that night's stay. Only other issue was a broken safe, which meant that we had to be moved to a different room.Otherwise we thought that the Econo Lodge was a clean & comfortable play to stay. We are used to NYC noise, so the street noise wasn't a big deal - although I guess that might bother some people (use the earplugs). Breakfast was fine / seating a problem so you might have to bring your breakfast back up to your room. $$$ in that area are exhorbitant; if you are looking to save $ - this is a good choice.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin","rollngstone</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milwaukee, Wisconsin</strong>",506,4.0

When we arrived, two rooms (each with two beds, same as our reservation) were given to the walk-in customers just ahead of us in line. It took 2 people 20 minutes to deal with those people, then we were greeted with a pre-written apology letter claiming an ""unexpected maintenance issue"" meant we had to stay at a different hotel for one night. They offered discount coupons for attractions we could not visit, plus cab fare to the GEM Hotel which was nowhere near Times Square (at 449 W 36th St ... we liked the GEM very much despite its more remote location). The Econo Lodge offered 20 percent off the first night's stay. I didn't want a discount for one night; I wanted the room I reserved, and I didn't believe the story about a ""maintenance issue."" Overbooked, perhaps? Since we were only staying two nights, we had to change hotels each night at a hotel a long distance away from the area we needed to be in, causing extra wear and tear on my young niece who suffers from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The disruption was terribly inconvenient, a poor attempt at customer service, and the rattled front clerk (rattled perhaps because she knew the problem wasn't ""maintenance issues?"") was horribly inefficient in dealing with us and the earlier guests we saw checking in. Econo Lodge needs to improve its customer service training! Because our day started so early the second day (when we had to take a cab to drop off our bags at Econo Lodge) we had the decent breakfast buffet, served 6 to 9 a.m. We left our bags at the front desk, and they assured us the bags would be taken to our room when the room was ready. When we returned at about 5 p.m., the bags were still behind the desk.

The front desk staff were all very helpful and friendly. The lobby has a few tables, a computer & printer for guest use (for a fee, mind you), and the usual tourist brochures. There is ONE elevator that services all floors and also serves as the service elevator. It's slow and often has a mind of its own - push 1st floor button, for example, and you may find yourself on the 6th floor. Not a big deal, but if you're in a hurry, plan ahead.My room was very small, as is usually the case in NYC, pretty worn around the edges - but very clean. The room air freshener used is enough to make you puke - it's so incredibly strong and overpowering. I actually turned on the air conditioner's fan to try and dissipate the odor. The bed seemed fairly new and was comfortable. There was also a fridge in the room, a wee closet, a safe, and earplugs - good idea. iron & ironing board, alarm clock radio, curtains that didn't quite cover all of the lone window. Breakfast during my stay consisted of hard boiled eggs, pastries including fresh croissants, mini slices of 2 types of cheese and mini slices of a hard salami, bagels, yogurt, oranges & apples, orange juice, cold cereals, coffee & tea. There isn't enough seating in the lobby for all guests at breakfast - the front desk told me each room has a tray of some sort for people to bring breakfasts back to their room. (mine had an old plastic tray; i saw another guest with half of a cardboard box). The air conditioner's fan worked well for both white noise for sleeping and for getting rid of the awful air freshener odor. The shower was hot but not powerful, the wi-fi was pretty lame. Considering the rate for this hotel is often comparable to other properties in the same neighborhood, the quality of the room and stay doesn't justify the prices charged. I'm in NYC 4 to 5 times a year and this was my first stay at this property. I'm not sure I would stay again, although the 20% discount card offered to me upon my departure could be a nice incentive.","Lakeland, Minnesota","AdventureLass</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lakeland, Minnesota</strong>",378,3.0

Hotwire placed us here and we walked a few blocks in the pouring rain, with our luggage to the hotel. Lol When we got there, we were warmly greeted by the front desk staff and quickly checked in. What a relief. The room was on the 8th floor, and when we walked in, it seemed as if the maid had just sprayed 2 whole bottles of fabreeze in there. It was very thick. After about 5-10 minutes of light choking on the fabreeze, we unpacked all the stuff we needed. The room was tiny tiny tiny, but I guess that's to be expected in NYC. I mean, the wifey and I are not big people, but there were places that we needed to squeeze by each other, that's how small it was. After a night on the town in the rain, we got back and fell a sleep. We were woken at 3am by a loud knock at the door, by someone who was supposedly given our room number to stay in, in error. Luckily I had put on the door latch, when we go in, or he would've walked right in with me and my wife fast asleep! After going to the door and telling him we were there, we got a call from the front desk, asking for our name!? After I told them what they wanted, no explanation was given, and she hung up. I was not pleased at this point, and called them back to find out what was going on. It looks like there was a miscommunication with the day and night staff, and that they had given that guy out room to stay in. We eventually fell back asleep, and the next day when we checked out, they had a card for us apologizing for the mixup. All in all, even with that A.M. mishap, it wasn't that bad.

The price that we've paid was quite modest, comparing the other equivalent Manhattan hotels. There were three tolerated downfalls: one was the shower, for the unstable flow of hot water. We've complained about it and the stuff did check it out twice, but with no results. We felt discomfort to complain again because we did not want to nag, but it will be for the benefit of this lovely hotel to tackle this problem in order to avoid such complaints from future guests.The second was the street noise, but the earplugs supplied by the hotel helped to ease that uncomforting a bit...The third was the tiny space for breakfast.

Staff very apologetic but I was tired after a long flight and not impressed with the inconvenience, I think it was more a case of the room double booked. I was given discount vouchers and a bottle of wine which was a nice thought. When i did finally get my room, i was told lift was 'out of order' and i was on the 5th floor! Luckily the staff offered to take all my luggage up, but lift wasn't working for 2 days which made it very inconvenient, again staff very apologetic, it wasn't there fault.Wifi was also not working despite the front desk staff best attempts to reset it etc. Took 2 days for that to also be fixed. For a city that never sleeps wheels sure do turn very slowly or maybe its just this hotel.The rooms were functional, i booked the 'deluxe' room with refrigerator and it was very modest so wouldn't of booked the lesser category. House keeping was very efficient and punctual. Breakfast was ok, basic continental, same thing everything morning no changes, tea n coffee available 24hrs.All in all i am sure there are better hotels around but the location is good a block from times square, a grocery store on the corner, and beside that grays sightseeing office which operates the hop on off bus.

Last time I tried it in NY, the place was filthy and had bed bugs, so I was a bit worried about this. However, it was fine. The rooms were tiny, but about the same as many in that area I have stayed in, which are generally 1.5-2x the price. So I was happy for the location. We only planned to sleep there anyway. Unfortunately, the weather didn't cooperate, so we were stuck in the room a lot over the 3 days. Then I had a chance to use the internet. WIFI is free, but painfully slow. As is common, the windows don't open, so one cannot get fresh air. The room was very hot at one point. We could not control the temperature and called the front desk. They said they have to make the change, so it took a long time. In the meantime, we had to have the hall door propped open to get a little more comfortable. The room was clean and no sign of bed bugs! What a relief! The sink was cracked and did not drain well, but luckily the bath tub did drain normally. It is only a half tub - not sure how anyone could take a bath, but it was perfectly fine for a shower. The towels were adequate, but about half the size of regular hotels (you get what you pay for). It would be difficult to stay longer than a few days, since there is practically no storage. The limited space required a dance with another person, to get by each other. There was a tiny desk, tiny night stand and tiny armoire with a safe, that did not work for us (but I didn't bother asking to have it fixed). There were adequate outlets. The oddest thing for us was having to remember to get a new key card each day. There was a single, slow elevator, so if we forgot it was a long trip back to get a new key. Also, the WIFI code changes daily, although that is available by phone. We read complaints about the noise. Perhaps it's because we live in another city, but we found it all quite tolerable and did not have to use the earplugs provided by the hotel. The price (we paid about $160/night) included a free breakfast, which was better than I expected (some times hard boiled eggs, meats and cheeses along with fruit, cereal, pastries, bagels, juice and coffee). Coffee was available all day, too. I tried to describe it accurately. It was mostly about the location for us, so we will return. But besides that, we were pleasantly surprised by how wonderful all of the staff were - each one of them. That was another plus. They will hold your bags before check in and after check out, which is nice. The only bad thing is there is no public bathroom in the lobby, so we had to go to a restaurant before leaving for the long trip home.",Cape May Beach,"Donald S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cape May Beach</strong>",263,3.0

That means it isn't awful because you expect a nyc budget hotel to be terrible. It is clean. Everything works. The bed is comfortable. The internet was good enough to stream some TV (better late at night). The bathroom was free of scary things. The door locked. The maids cleaned. It was cheap...even cheaper with points which is how I paid. If a friend put you up here you would 'unfriend them' tomorrow. It is the kind of place that you book for yourself...rather sell to yourself by saying things like ""how much time will I spend in the room?"" or ""I do want to be close to Times Square"". But really, there is NOTHING about the hotel that you would brag about and you won't be sharing photos of your ""gem of a room"" with your coworkers back home. As Joan Rivers once said ""the room was so small that when I put my key in the door, I broke the window"". The desk is for a child, the toilet is for a child and the closet is for a doll. You can sit at the desk and reach back and remove things from the closet. You can rest your foot on the bed while you type on your laptop at the desk. You have to close the door to use the sink in the bathroom. Get the picture? You can't 'walk around the bed' as it is all but wedged into the room. So, the hotel is safe and clean but you may want to cover your face as you leave so nobody gets a picture of you there. Get it? Lastly, if you're a couple than it's better to be newlyweds.

Make sense? let me start by saying the hotel location ROCKS. we walked to the theater, we walked to dinner. we walked around. so simple to get to times square, 5th avenue, theater district and eats. it is also one of, if not THE most affordable hotels in the city, given the location. you'll still pay around $200 a night, but go hotel shopping and you'll see this is one of the best you'll get, for the area its in.as other reviewers have stated, the room is really tiny. however i have stayed in the more upscale hotel tiers in ny and they are around the same size. its a new york thing, and i am all for chillin' in my room, but in the city i really am only in the room to sleep.which brings me to the thing. SLEEPING. because of the location, u pay for it at night. i have no idea how such a large number of people have so much energy all night, and you can hear it all night long. i was definitely not super surprised, as when i flicked on the bathroom light upon arrival there were 2 packages of earplugs on the counter lol. they just didn't help. there is a party outside your window 24-7.anyhow, back to other good things. the room is super clean, comfy bed. the walls are paper thin, but you can't sleep here at night anyway.really loved the breakfast in the morning. yes the lobby is tight, but think of it as the same size of your room. they provided fresh donuts (cream filled too!), pastries, bagels, yogurt, juices and coffee. for free this was pretty great.beware there is no valet parking. u must park the next street over and its a garage at $48 a day. its tough....do u stay at a pricier hotel with parking or do you go cheaper but pay separate for parking? lastly, hotel staff was pretty pleasant. we were always greeted coming in and going out. all in all, if i was in town for a night, i would stay here. longer than that though...i mean, i dunno. a girl's gotta sleep:)","Baltimore, Maryland","kel400</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Baltimore, Maryland</strong>",94,3.0

It's not ritzy but everything makes this a great place to stay if you'd rather spend your money on Broadway shows and museums. First, the rooms are impeccably clean and the furniture is new. Size is small but who cares when all you use your room for is to sleep and shower -- but yes there is a tub to soak in if that's your thing. It's a short walk to the Broadway TCKTS booth. it's free breakfast is excellent -- it reminds me of breakfast in a French hotel -- except for the bagels, of course. In addition to the usual coffee, juice, danish, bagels and muffins, they have sliced sausages and cheeses, fruits and yogurt. I also love the mix you meet in their small lobby at breakfast -- people young and old from a variety of countries. It's a great place to stay. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't compete in size with the other expensive hotels. It is on a busy corner and the street traffic is a little noisy at night, so ask for a room on the top floor. I've never had trouble sleeping, but have sometimes heard noise. When I say sleep quality is average below, I'm referring to the street noise -- the bedding is very comfortable.","New London, Connecticut","Dottie N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New London, Connecticut</strong>",16,4.0

The location is great, the staff was friendly and the room was pretty clean. The rooms are extremely small, as it has been said before. I've stayed in other hotels in NYC and this was by far the smallest (there is literally maybe a foot on each side of the bed - no real room of lots of luggage).

And every one of them seemed genuinely friendly and bought into service culture. That's a BIG plus to me.The location, one block from Times Square and walking distance to our favorite NYC restaurant in Columbus Circle, is also a BIG plus.What's NOT so big is the room we had. I've had small rooms in Paris, Venice and New York before. I believe our room was 8 feet by 8 feet. There was no place to put our luggage except the windowsill and small cramped hallway - it would not fit on the floor between the bed and the wall on any side of the bed, and we only travel with luggage that meets airline overhead size restrictions. Now I have to admit the room was clean, and smelled nice, but it was beat up a bit (patchwork wallpaper) and the bed was comfortable on one side but not the other. Other observations about this hotel: The 19"" tv had problems with over half the channels (a black window would appear in the middle with a bunch of code - see pic attached to review). Ironically, the screen size did not seem small, relative to the tiny room.The elevator worked off and on, and I felt sorry for the Italian guest who were lugging huge suitcases up the cramped, dimly lit staircase. There was a note posted on each floor apologizing for the telephones not working as well. We are generally loyal to Choice hotels but I don't think I could stand a room this small again, even though we only come back to the room to shower and sleep. And I can't imagine the problems with the tv, elevator, telephones was a symphony of anomalies. Oh, I forgot to mention the cracked sink in the bathroom (pic) and the fights, sirens and endless honking outside the hotel until 3am on Saturday.","Washington, DC","IntrepidFromDC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, DC</strong>",140,3.0

Later that evening when I was checking myBank balance I seen that the money was also takenFrom my account!! I went downstairs to the same girl and told her, she advised that she contacted the bank and they said it was only a hold and be be returned straight away. I found it quite odd and off putting that she had chose not to give meA heads up about this when she first cancelled my card transaction, she just waited until I cameDownQuerying it, maybe she was hoping I wouldn't notice and it would go back in on time I'mNot sure, anyhow I was happy it was going straight back in and left it at that. However three days later and still no money returned, massive nuisance for me as my holiday was almost over and I was down 600 dollars!! I had to go back andForth 3/4 times about this and finally they did get it put back onto my card. After this happened I remembered that I had used a friends card to confirm and preauthorise the first nights stayBooking three days before I arrived and was told by email that it would return in 3-5 days, so I got onto him and of course the money still wasn't returned.. Still hasn't been returned!!! Again I was advised of this 30-60 day [--] , obviously I was very annoyed as it had now seemed like I was charged three times for one booking!!!! Another hour or two of nuisance caused by having to contact banks to get numbers etc so they could stop the hold on the money andStill nothing as of yet. I'mSure if this hotel was booked by credit card or cash it would have been a lot better but DO NOT pay by debit card as you will have to chase themFor the money back!

There was an issue with my reservations and I ended up speaking with Daisy (manager) who was very polite and accommodating. She made the first impression of the hotel great. She worked with me to fix the problem to a reasonable degree. All prices of hotels in Manhattan was so expensive to me and the price of even the Econolodge for what I was getting seemed high but after the experience I believe it was worth the price. The room was small (expected it after reading reviews) but my boyfriend and I had to get used to it and we did. I do know how people who have a lot of luggage and are taller than 5'9"" tall would fare in the room for long periods of time as we had to maneuevor around each other to get around the bed and to the bathroom. The bathroom toilet seat would not stay up but the hot water and water pressure were great. Having a hair dryer and iron in the room was also great. The room safe instructions did not match the room safe we had in the room so we did not end up using the safe. The room was clean enough (paint chips and older looking carpets) but we did have towels and bed sheets with noticeable stains a few nights. I did notice the room to be a little dusty for my boyfriend who is prone to allergies. I liked that after maid service we were left with two bottles of water each day and chips. All staff was very polite and helpful which was appreciated. The elevator is slow for having only 6 floors but not a big deal. The continental breakfast was a great thing to have each morning included in the hotel rate. They give you ear plugs which we had to use each night because we would not have been able to sleep without it due to the noise of honking taxis, sirens from ambulances/fire trucks but that is what I expected. The room temperature was perfect for our trip in the fall. The location was perfect. Close to subways stations on 49th and 50th street. Neighborhood is safe. Close to Penn Station if you take a train to NYC. For security, you needed to have your room key code changed each day which was a new experience for me. But I appreciated the security measures. Time square and the theaters are in walking distance and so is Bryant Park. I asked the front desk clerk to arrange a car service from hotel to JFK and they did. Did not realize the car service was ""cash only"" and didn't have change but luckily we had cash. Overall experience at this hotel was fine and I believe the staff made the hotel stay the best besides the location.

The desk is in the walk way to get to the bed and then to get to the other side of the bed nearest the window was also difficult.

Location is great. It's 2-3 blocks from Times Square and in the theater district, but it's off the main streets (between 8th and 9th) so you don't get the same street noise as from Times Square. There is great food on 9th Avenue as well. 2). The value for mid-town Manhattan is hard to beat (especially if you are a choice hotel privileges member). In my personal opinion, anyone visiting NYC for pleasure spends very little time in the hotel anyway and EconoLodge aren't trying to charge an arm and a leg knowing their patrons aren't spending much time in the rooms. 3). Even though the rooms are very small, they are clean and the staff are friendly, professional and helpful. The continental breakfast is good and they leave coffee out most of the day and fresh ice water. I've seen a few negative reviews on here about having to wait on the rooms, or the staff being not so friendly, but I've never encountered that in my stays. However, even if I did, I think I'd be willing to forgive because I know not everyone is perfect and everyone has an off day.

My wife and I were visiting her college friend from when they attended Cal State LA many years ago. My wife made the reservations and everything about our four-day visit (Friday through Monday) was perfect. The professionalism and helpfulness of the staff and the quality of the decor and furniture made me feel that I was staying at a hotel with a fancier name (going by California standards). The close proximity (two blocks) to Times Square and the tour bus station made for a memorable and fun experience. The room was a bit of close quarters by California standards, but my wife's sister-in-law had forewarned us of what to expect and it was just part of our NYC experience. The complimentary breakfast was one of the best I've experienced and they kept it well-stocked until the end of the breakfast period. When we come back to New York next year, this is where we're staying.My only somewhat negative experience involved the souvenir shop next door. The salesman gave us discounts and then asked for cash rather than take our credit card. He then didn't offer a receipt and I didn't press the issue. I was able to return a defective item the next morning with no problem, but I now realize he could have been pocketing the cash for himself. So I would recommend always saying I don't have the cash and paying with a credit card.","Los Angeles, California","Glenn W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",3,5.0

My husband and I arrived into LaGuardia late at night 9:30 p.m. due to a canceled flight in Chicago. However, our luggage was put on a later flight and did not arrive until after 10:00 p.m. We took a taxi from LaGuardia to the hotel. The fare was $34.83. I was a bit bummed because I really wanted to check out the city. I was not disappointed as NYC really does not ever sleep!!! We checked into Econolodge, a block from Times Square and walked around and had pizza at one of the MANY little pizza shops that must stay open til I don’t know when!!! There were lots of places open to eat within a block of the hotel…even after midnight. We ended up getting back to the hotel around 1:30 a.m. The Econolodge had a different vibe for me. Price was good by New York standards compared to the other hotels I researched. We had a Queen size room. However, the room was SOOOO SMALL!!!! I cruise as often as I can and a prior poster stated that this room prepared her for her cabin on the cruise she was about to go on. I kid you not, this room was smaller than any oceanview or balcony cabin I have ever stayed in on four different cruiselines. It is TINY!!!! The bathroom was probably about the size of a cruiseship bathroom. I am a small person and I had trouble walking around the bed in our room. Breakfast at the hotel was nothing to write home about unless you were venting. We ended up throwing it away it was so bad and going out for breakfast. Hotel staff was AWESOME!!!! Staff was very helpful and courteous. The hotel is situated at the corner of 47th Street and 8th Avenue. The location of the hotel is very noisy. There is a fire station within a few hundred feet. It seemed like sirens were going off all night long. There is also a travel tour company with the double decker buses a couple buildings away, GrayLine I believe is what it was called. We used City Sights New York and did the night tour of the city and the 1 ½ hour boat tour of the island and rode the buses as an “on / off” mode of transportation. There were other things thrown in with the ticket, but we didn’t use them as we had already been on those excursions. I believe our pass was $59 per person. On Sunday when we were there, at least 10 blocks by the hotel were blocked off for street vendors selling everything from Gyro’s; Funnel Cakes; BBQ; Lemonade; scarves; jewelry; t’shirts/sweatshirts; and notebook/phone covers, etc. The street vendors are there until 6:00 p.m. Ninth Avenue is loaded with tons of restaurants and nightclubs. While in New York City, we did the Statue of Liberty tour including the Crown; Rockefeller Tour with passes to the Top of the Rock; 9/11 Memorial Site; Top of the Empire State Building; NBC Studio Tour and went to see the Broadway Show Mamma Mia. We were very disappointed in the NBC Studio Tour. The tour starts out with a movie about the past shows from NBC that lasts about 7 minutes. You then go to studio where they tell you they film Saturday Night Live (Very Tiny). Then they take you to a “Simulated news/weather room” where two people from your group will pretend to be the weather person and newscaster. And that is pretty much the extent of it. Definitely not worth the $27.50 we paid for the tickets. When we left, we took a taxi from the hotel to Penn Station, to catch a train to Philadelphia. The taxi fare for that trip was around $12.00. Penn Station is an absolutely beautiful train station. Even if you are not taking a train anywhere, it is worth a look.",missouri,"branson4me</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>missouri</strong>",26,4.0

The lady at the front desk was nice and said to help myself to the free (continental) breakfast as it was almost over. I asked if I could get a mini refrigerator in my room, and she said if there was one available, they would bring it to my room. (That was the last I heard about it as they never contacted me either way, so I didn't know if one was available or not.)The room was very tiny, but I did expect that because I read the reviews before I booked it. Since I was going to be there only for two nights during the Memorial Day weekend, I'd be okay with it. However, it would've been hard for two people to stay longer with bigger luggage. Not much room to even walk around by the bed, let alone to have space to store your luggage. The bathroom was okay, fairly clean and small but enough for me to move around, but the closet was so very small! It could only fit my blouse. I had to hang my pants and dress by the lamp stand since they couldn't fit in the closet. Besides the free continental breakfast, the hotel also provided free wireless internet in the room, My room was on the top floor (only 6 floors), but I could hear a lot of noise from the outside, which made it hard for me to sleep. Not too sure if there was near a bar or something, but there a lot of people talking and yelling to the wee hours of the morning, not to mention all the cars honking.One other thing to note, you have to swipe your cardkey at the front desk after midnight every night.I will probably stay here again in the future because of the location and the price.",Honolulu,"NDC808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu</strong>",16,3.0

I made the reservation for 4 of us, 2 adults and our 2 children. When I attempted to make it online, the form indicated that children under the age of 18 are free. It gave me a price of $278. I called the hotel to verify the price and was told that I was mistaken and the price should be $350. I explained repeatedly that the site said 2A/2C was $278 plus tax totaling $322. The woman on the phone was adamant that it was $350 plus tax. When she asked the ages of the children, I told her 13 and 15 and I was immediately told that anyone over the age of 7 was considered an adult. I explained that the site said ""18"" and she again said that I was mistaken and anyone over the age of 7 was an adult. THis is absurd.I asked to speak with a manager and was told that SHE was mistaken but anyone over the age of 12 was an adult and the site was wrong. I was then told that the price should be $350 plus tax and again the site was wrong but he would give me a ""special discount"" which would bring it to $325 plus tax. I explained that I didn't want to make the reservation on the site because I have had those get messed up before and I wanted to speak with an actual person but that I felt they were playing games with the charges. Then he told me that although the site said the room would hold 4 adults, it 'really didn't and was very very small'. I asked if the room was still available and that we would have 2A/ 2C and I expected that the amount on the site be honored because I was at the point where I was going to call corporate since I was a Choice member. Immediately he told me that I was right all along and that the room would hold 4 people for the price of $278 plus tax. Sad that I had to threaten to call Choice hotel group to get that taken care of.Once we arrived, we rec'd a nice room. Actually the location was fairly nice -- the room was extremely small but it is NY so I didn't expect more. I can honestly say that we had to turn sideways to walk from the one end of the room to the other to get into the bed. The bathroom as well was tiny but it was probably one of the cleanest hotels I have stayed in. We had a pretty good view of Times Square (part of it) and it was convenient to lots of things to do and restaurants. I don't know if I would stay there again.

So, not even I was quite sure on what to expect with our stay in the Econo Lodge in Times Square. Upon our arrival in NYC, we decided to make the 15 minute walk from Penn Station to Times Square, and into the Econo Lodge's doors. Sean and I pride ourselves - maybe even a bit too much - on being hospitality geeks of sorts; having both worked for the likes of Disney and Universal - we've come to crave a certain level of hospitality when traveling. And, yes. I may or may not have some ""requirements"" hotels have to meet before I even consider staying there! The Econo Lodge in Times Square did NOT disappoint. We were greeted with one of the FRIENDLIEST of staffs I've ever met -- honestly, EVERYONE we came in contact with treated us like family, and extended us the warmest of greetings every time we saw them. The rooms were clean and perfectly comfortable for the time that we were there (a note to mention: hotel rooms, in general, in NYC aren't exactly the size many of us are normally accustomed to -- but this didn't bother us a bit as we used the room for minimal downtime and the occasional sleeping when we weren't busy exploring) - and we had a great view of the streets and buildings around us.Another GREAT feature of the Econo Lodge in Times Square is, quite simply, it's LOCATION! Found on the corner of 47th and 7th -- you're a quick walk from nearby subway stations. Where we were able to have quick, easy access to the E train (for downtown travel - think World Trade Center Memorial, Battery Park, views of the Statue of Liberty, etc) -- and even the B and D trains where we were able to get an express train to The Bronx and Yankees Stadium. In the heart of the City, you'll also find that the Econo Lodge is an easy walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, and even The Empire State Building.I honestly could not say enough incredible things about this property -- and we will ABSOLUTELY be seeking the Econo Lodge out on our future trips into New York.

Not only did she make that smooth, but she helped to make the stay a delightful one, right along with the other staff. The lodge is also conveniently located a hop and skip away from Time Square. Close enough for you to get back to the hotel soon after a long day of sight-seeing and shopping and just farther enough to be away from the noise.

It is located in the middle of the Theatre District and is within walking distance to all of the main tourist sites in Mid-Town Manhattan. The only negative is the size of the rooms. About 180 sq feet. In our room the wall from the head of the bed to the foot of the bed measured 8 ft. Really hard to get around the foot of the bed, especially for those late night visits to the potty. You have to walk sideways to get around the bed. The complimentary breakfast was the usual fare but well kept up. The bad part is that they have no tables and chairs to eat at. You either sit on benchs with your food in your lap or take it to your room and eat in bed. With all this said, it's still a great location for the price and the extra friendly staff make up for some of the inconveniences. I recommend that visitors go one block west (9th Ave.) to eat.

This hotel was exactly as I expected it to be based on the reviews I had scanned through first. I knew by the room number that I would be walking up one floor, since 700 is the only room on the 7th floor. Street noise existed in the form of sirens, but would have been worse closer to the street.When I saw that NYC water bagels were included in the continental breakfast on the hotel's website, I knew I would be delighted with breakfast. Breakfast also included mini muffins, mini danish, croissants, strudel, hard boiled eggs, several types of tea, coffee, instant oatmeal, 2 kinds of cold cereal and orange juice. I absolutely loved those bagels!! There was very limited space to put out the food or eat, but staff was busy re-filling everything as it disappeared. My only complaint with breakfast is this: why isn't there a later breakfast time on Saturday and Sunday AMs?Location, location, location! This hotel was a very short walk to Broadway shows, restaurants and Times Square. We also took a walk twice to Central Park, it was about 12 blocks. The parking lot was close by and a great reduction in the rate for being a guest at the hotel.The front desk staff was very helpful about all sorts of things, including looking up phone numbers and locations to wherever we needed. I suggested to the front desk staff that they put an additional chair in the room since there was space for it. There was only one chair in the Superior Queen and they liked my suggestion. My only other complaint: I like softer T.P. in the bathroom. :-)I will joke about the prices of hotels in NYC--we felt that the hotel was a 2 star hotel for a 4 star price, but in comparison with other hotels in this area, it is an extremely good value.","Fairfax, Virginia","Nurse_Joanie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fairfax, Virginia</strong>",9,4.0

We chose this hotel based on reviews, the rate that we were able to get and its proximity to where we needed to be the next day. The rooms and hotel are small, which we expected given that it is right in Manhattan. In general it was clean, but the appliances and decor was quite outdated. The elevator up to our room was so old and creaky, we were concerned we were going to get stuck! The main issue that we experienced is that we went in the month of March, which was still quite chilly and windy in NY. The hotel leaves the air conditioning units in the windows year round, which led to the room being very cold and also incredibly noisy. I barely got a few hours of sleep as I could hear every little noise on the street (which is a LOT of noise in times square!) I feel that if the A/C unit was out of the window, and the window could be fully closed this would definitely cut down on the noise. There was no background fan that we could locate to help drown out the noise. If you decide to stay here, bring your ear plugs if you would like to get some sleep.Also, the continental breakfast in the morning left a lot to be desired. We were hopeful that we would be able to grab something and go, and were lucky to be able to split a small muffin as there was nothing left. We ended up just eating at a diner down the road, so don't decide on this place because of the free breakfast.It wasn't the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at, and the price was decent but I don't see any reason why we would ever return to stay here.","Binghamton, New York","988ElizabethW</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Binghamton, New York</strong>",10,3.0

You touched the towel bar and it fell out of the wall, putting all the towels on the floor. We then found a large hairball/hair extension on the floor between the beds, so obviously the room had not been properly cleaned between guests. There were a lots of chips in the enamel of the sink and tub. So if this hotel was new in 2006, it has been a rough 6 years. The breakfast area is right in front of the check-in desk (within 5 feet) and there was only one small round table and 2 chairs, one wooden bench and 3 or 4 dirty black upholstered chairs, otherwise you had to just stand in the same floor space as people coming in or checking out with their luggage.

So we decided it would be more convenient to stay in the city since I am a paraplegic and in a wheelchair, and we didn't want to travel home so late. When I called to reserve a room, I spoke to Nigel at the front desk, and specifically requested a handicap accessible room. Also, I made sure there were elevators and handicap entrances/exits. Nigel reassured us that we would be staying in a wheelchair accessible room and the hotel was as well. When we got to our room, it wasn't AT ALL handicap accessible, let alone wheelchair accessible. We asked Nigel if he could switch us to a different room and he said ""there were no more rooms available in the hotel...all booked up"". He went on to say that the ""girl"" that reserved our room ""made a mistake and he would give her a call and get back to us"". When I told him I couldn't fit into the bathroom, shower, and could hardly move about the room, he said he would ""gladly check us out of the hotel, free of charge and we could stay somewhere else"". After an hour of Nigel blaming the ""girl"" that messed up our reservation, he finally credited a few dollars back on our card. I was hoping he would just apologize and take responsibility for his mistake. But he insisted that I ""must not have told the girl that I was handicap"". I have been a paraplegic for almost 10 years and spend about 90% of my time in my wheelchair. I am still offended beyond belief. But he denied that we ever spoke while making the reservation. I wasn't able to shower, I barely slept, and my husband had to pick me up and put me on and off of the toilet whenever necessary. I called Econo Lodge Headquarters to make a complaint and nobody will return my calls...It's been a month now. My family, friends and I take frequent trips, in and out of state.

On top of that, they even let me store my luggage for 4 hours after I checked out the next day so I could continue my site seeing trip without finding a storage area for my bags. They even gave me tips for hailing a cab without making me feel stupid having never done it before. Yes, the rooms are small, but I was only there for a few hours to sleep, so no need to have a huge luxurious place to lay my head.

The rooms were small, and so-so furnished (2 small pillows per double bed, very thin linens, scratchy towels) but functional. I thought the toiletries were awful,and smelt of urinal cakes. In fact they were really unpleasant - I've never used lotion that left my skin stinging!Free internet and phone calls were a nice touch. The basic breakfast in the morning was ok, but you often had no where to eat it due to a lack of space.

The location is incredible and safe, the room was very clean and comfortable, and the staff was extremely nice and helpful.

We have a 4 and 6 year-old and we will stay at this hotel with our family when we go back to NYC.We stayed in room 700, which is the only room on the 7th floor and it is the biggest room in the hotel with a queen bed. The room was big and comfortable; there was plenty of room for luggage; it had a small desk, a small armoire to hang some clothes in, and a small fridge; we had plenty of room to walk around the room we didn't have to crawl over the bed to get around the room or answer the phone; free internet via ethernet cable; since it was on the 7th floor it was quiet and we could not hear the ambient street noise. The only drawbacks with this room are: you have to get off at the 6th floor and take the stairs to the 7th floor, which was not a big deal for me and my wife, but it could be for some with disabilities; the water/shower pressure is poor during certain high-use times being on the 7th floor; and there is only one bed if you are looking for a room for a family and need two beds, but there is enough room for small inflatable beds for kids. We didn't eat breakfast here but it looked like your average continental breakfast and they always had coffee ready. There is a Starbucks (1 of 1,500 in Manhattan) across the street and there is a great little bakery called Amy's Bread one block away on 9th Ave. between 47th and 46th St. that we ate at several of times. There is a pharmacy across the street and several small markets within a block or two.

I would not recommend this hotel if you are travelling with a family, the room is ok for 2 people at most. There is little space to walk in the room, I would have to climb over the bed to get to the bathroom or door. Breakfast was non-existent it was just a shelf of juice, coffee, possibly toast, not much to choose from. The hotel room could use some updating: - The bathroom: Although the sink looked updated, the showerhead/tub could use some renos and spots of rust were noticed. The shower curtains had stains and looked ""old"". The overall space in the bathroom was small, the toilet was right near the door, so you had to ""squeeze in"" before closing the door.- The carpet floor was just average and dirty.- The room : Air condition was the one where you put on the window sill, I noticed stains on the walls and cracks.- The hallway is narrow and quite humid cause the aircondition does not flow though the whole hallway.- One day the cleaing staff failed to clean our room, and when asked, reminded us that they could not clean it since they were leaving at 5 o'clock. Even though we had been out of the room most of the day and it was still not cleaned. - Be careful with your valuables because our camera came up missing and the last time we saw it was in the room. When we discovered the camera was missing we had to call the hotel several times before getting a response that they didn't find the camera.I would ONLY recommend this hotel, just for the location. It is walking distance to most things and does not take long to get to your destination, but if you are looking for comfort, this would not be the hotel to book at. For me, I would have spent a little bit extra to be comfortable and have space to put my luggage.

They were up-beat and were able to check us in early because my transportation got us to the city earlier than expected. The room, although a bit small, was exceptionally clean and had everything the description indicated. In fact, the whole hotel is very clean and quiet except for the occasional sirens from the ""outside"" world .... but remember, this is the city of the world....you must expect activity outside. The next day, you are treated to a free continental breakfast which isn't the greatest but does offer bagels, yogurt, coffee, juice, and cereal, You are better off going a few steps away and have a ""real"" breakfast but it will cost you. They also held our luggage because our transportation wouldn't be ready until 8:00pm. This is a great service so you can get an extra day in the city and not worry about dragging your luggage with you. We would definitely stay here again.","Jefferson, New York","TazRon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jefferson, New York</strong>",61,4.0

The location is fantastic. Less than five minutes walk to Times Square. Numerous Subway lines are also within easy walking distance. There is a drug store on the other side of 47th street which provides all kinds of groceries, an ATM, pharmacy services, etc. There area also a few great take out joints nearby on 8th Avenue. There aren’t too many frills on offer at the EconoLodge. Breakfast is provided and consists of cereals, bagels, some fruit, coffee and OJ. There is only one elevator and it’s quite slow. If, for some reason, you’re looking for a room to do some aerobics, you may be disappointed because you’re going to struggle finding enough space to set up the ironing board, let alone do much else other than stow your luggage and lie down. 8th Avenue is a popular route for fire fighters, so you may find yourself disturbed at 3 AM by the sound of a fire engine. There isn't much insulation from the noise of the city that never sleeps (but if you're looking for some place quiet, why are you visiting NYC?).Having said that, the staff are very friendly and helpful. The place is clean. Who wants to spend time in their hotel room when they’re in New York City, anyway?! The EconoLodge provides a good place to lay your weary head.

The lady at the reception was very friendly and quickly booked us in to our room on the top floor looking out on to 47th Street. The room I found was extremely small, yet adequate for what we needed realistically. We just about had enough room to throw our suitcases in two corners, but for two people that were planning on being up early every morning, room space wasn't really a priority. We had expected it, especially at the competitive price we got the room for. The room was clean and tidy as was the bathroom however small it was too (I also found that after we'd showered the room got very warm, mainly from the steam in the bathroom), but again adequate. If you want a cheap room, expect a room along this lines. The big plus for me was the fact that the hotel was only literally a 2 minutes walk from Times Square. I did find that at night the location in general was very very noisy (horns blowing, trucks moving around, etc) but as it was only a block or two from Times Square, that was also to be expected, and as far as I'm aware all the rooms face the one way. There was breakfast served in the lobby every morning (coffee, orange juice, small selection of teas, croissants, bagels, etc - ps the orange juice was delicious!!!) but my problem with this was that it seemed to be cleared away shortly after 9am. I don't think it would have hurt to leave it out a little longer. Check out was quick and efficient too with the same girl that checked us in. She kindly took our luggage into the office as we still had time after check out to wander around, and booked us a taxi to the airport. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for a place to lie down for about 6 hours sleep, nothing fancy but a nice clean room where you can get a few hours rest to get up early again and get out for the day.

I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights with a girlfriend, although the location was awesome the room on the other hand, could have been better.As previously mentioned in the reviews the room is very tiny and cramped. I would not recommend this hotel if you are travelling with a family, the room is ideal for 2 people at most. There is little space to walk in the room, I would have to climb over the bed to get to the bathroom or door. One thing about this hotel is you would have to ""recharge"" your hotel room key every day before leaving. I tried getting back into the room late at night and my ""key"" would not work. When I went to the desk they said you have to recharge it every day when you leave and its could for that day only. I guess for security reasons that was good but annoying cause before going back to the room you have to ""recharge it"". Breakfast was non-existent it was just a shelf of juice, coffee, possibly toast, not much to choose from. And the Wi-fi would not load even with their password and login ID, just plain slow. If, you wanted to use the common area for the internet you would have to pay for usage and printer usage.The hotel room could use some updating: - The bathroom: Although the sink looked updated, the showerhead/tub could use some renos and spots of rust were noticed. The shower curtains had stains and looked ""old"". The overall space in the bathroom was small, the toilet was right near the door, so you had to ""squeeze in"" before closing the door.- The carpet floor was just average and dirty.- The room : Air condition was the one where you put on the window sill, I noticed stains on the walls and cracks.- The hallway is narrow and quite humid cause the aircondition does not flow though the whole hallway.I would ONLY recommend this hotel, just for the location. It is walking distance to most things and does not take long to get to your destination, but if you are looking for comfort, this would not be the hotel to book at. For me, I would have spent a little bit extra to be comfortable and have space to put my luggage. I guess it was just a place to sleep, but the bed wasn't that comfortable either.

The customer service was terrible. I made a call to reception and it took them 2 hours to respond to my simple request. The TV reception was extremely bad.Also be warned - they charge $3 PER ITEM to store your luggage - and they do not waive this under any circumstances. So if you arrive before 3pm - they will charge to store your bags. The same again on the day you leave. They do not do early check-ins. I was unable to speak to the manager - even though the manager was there - they pretended she wasn't. The customer service is rated 0/10. The worst customer service ever. They really don't care to make your stay pleasurable and if you are unhappy - they don't care in the slightest. Two ladies who checked in before us said they would never stay there again because of the $3 per bag charge (they had 4 bags). The hotel staff offered no discount on the $12 bag storage charge in order to make the customer happy. ICE is only at reception. The lift is VERY SLOW and only ONE lift in the building.

The place is OK, but a little shabby, and the room was pretty small. But, hey, this is NYC where shabby and small are the norm! Trust me, I've seen worse! I got a Queen bed, but the room was made for a double (at most), which is what I would order if I stayed there again. There was less than a foot of space between the wall and the end of the bed (the same applies to the space at the far/window side of the bed).-The bathroom wasn't huge, but was decently roomy when compared with other bathrooms in older, renovated hotels in NYC... and larger than most in Europe. Yes, some paint had peeled fromthe ceiling above the shower, but it was only a paint adhesion problem. Otherwise, the bathroom was clean & shiny with newer tile on both the walls & floor. There was plenty of hot water.- We found the bed comfy enough and supportive... And my back can be very fussy! The linens were clean, and the bottom sheet was fitted-- which isn't always true in budget hotels. Overall, the room was nice and clean.-The only problem was the air conditioner. It worked, but didn't cool too well. This would have been a major issue for me in the summer, but was passable in March. I reported it the next morning, and they had it repaired for our second night. It was better, but still barely sufficient. It was an old unit.-Still, keep in mind the excellent location... Close to everything in the theater district, and only 2 blocks from the subway. The neighborhood is NOT bad, and I don't know what that one reviewer was complaining about. Yes, I did hear fire trucks once. That 30 seconds didn't ruin my night.-Look... If you want the Hyatt or Mariott and can afford it, then go for it! However, if you don't mind sacrificing some room and/orsome minor creature comforts, then this place is OK. If the savings in $$ will make the difference in whether or not you you visit New York, and you plan to spend most of your time OUT of the room, then don't hesitate to stay there.-Oh, by the way... I never tried the continental breakfast in the smallish area one person griped about, but I've never based my judgment of any hotel on that, anyhow. You're in New York, for Pete's sake!

We sleep in it and get ready in it, so it was just what we were looking for. I have stayed in four star hotels in NYC, but wouldn't hesitate to stay in this two star again. The staff was wonderful and very helpful. We only took advantage of the breakfast once, it was small (grab and go), but a nice jump start to the day, and besides there aren't many hotels in NYC that have anything set out for breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised by our entire experience at Econo Lodge. We are big walkers and we walked all over from this location at all hours and felt safe, and I was with my teenage daughter. I don't make a point of nit picking small things at the places I have stayed at, I find the same problems in high or low end hotels; I think it's all in what you are looking for.

The review were right. This is somewhat of a hidden gem. The value ($169.99) was very good. The locaiton is fantastic - within 1-2 blocks of most theaters, short walk to Times Square, and 1 ""long block"" to 9th Avenue where there are tons of restaurants (and more on 8th Avenue too). The room we had was exceptionally small -- really little more than a bed, desk and bathroom. There was literally one foot on one side of the bed and one foot space at the foot of the bed. Other than that, there was very little room to maneuver around. Yet the room was very clean and fresh. The place has clearly been renovated from top to bottom. There is a small chest/wardrobe, and I mean small. It has a safe in it and it's not much wider than the safe. The safe was nice to have but too small for my laptop. There is a small desk which is good but if the chair is used you can't walk past it. The bathroom is clean and small but usable. Essentially it's like being on a cruise ship where there is no a spare square foot around. But since we went sightseeing all day, came back to get changed, went to theater and then late dinner and did not get back until midnight, we basically only used it for the bathroom, changing and sleeping.

My girl firend and I went here over a year ago and I still remember the look of the place. The hotel is within a few blocks of time square, but the hotel itself is a bit dated. You receive a continental breakfast in the morning of whatever bagels or muffins they have. They do offer coffee and tea for those who are interested. Not a satisfactory full meal, but good enough to start your day. The hotel room we got was one with a queen bed. With two girls and two full sized luggages, it was a bit cramped. We had to maneuver our luggage so we had access to it. The bed took up most of the room. The bathroom was on the small side as well. The room itself was old. The room had a weird smell without the air conditioner on and you definitely needed air conditioning in August. The hotel did manage to squeeze in a table into the room.

It was the best deal I could find (at least for a place that I felt comfortable staying in!). For $240.00 per night it was still pretty steep - but compared to the other hotels in the times square area for the dates I was traveling, this was was nice a bargain. When we got to the hotel, we had had TERRIBLE service from SuperShuttle, so I was not in a particularly good mood checking in. The desk clerk (who I am sure hear me yelling at the shuttle driver) was not super welcoming but she also wasn't unpleasant to deal with either. Then they told me I had to pay up-front; which is not the typical operation of a hotel. So my vacation did not get off to a good start. It was hot (our vacation happened to coincide with the 3 hottest days of the summer...over 100 every day!) and I was cranky and irratable after the flight and the horrible experience getting there. Then...we get to the room and holy smallville batman! there wasn't even room to walk around the bed - it was weged from wall to wall. But I had found in my travel research that hotel rooms in NYC were small. So okay - we will tolerate it. and Viola...finally a good vacation ensues! We headed downstairs to engulf ourselves in the wonders of NYC and find the nearest restraunt because we were starving. We stopped in the lobby to ask what they recommended nearby and the bellman was kind and most helpful. We were greeted when we returned by the nice bellman and a different desk clerk - and she was wearing a smile! Morning came and ...out we went into the great wide city. Passing thru the lobby we asked for extra towels for the rest of the week, and a wonderfully nice desk agent assured we would have them. We were also greeted by the kind bellman again, and there was a very nice continental breakfast to be had. Well...we got our extra towels. We got the extra blanket we asked for. There was fresh water bottles left for us every day, fresh soaps in the bathroom, and fresh linens. Every day we were joyfully greeted by the desk clerk and the bellman; and we had a splendid time! The service was good. The room was small but functional. The in-room safe didn't work and we were told the batteries needed to be changed; and I don't know if they changed them when we were out of the room; but we were never able to get it to work. It could have been the safe...it could have been us not being clever enough how to figure it out.

But when you're in NYC, you're not spending much time in the room anyway. I've seen the reviews on similarly priced hotels, and if you even get a private bathroom, you may see rodents. But at the Econo Lodge, the rooms were fairly clean and you get your own decent-sized bathroom. I actually stay at this hotel every time I go to NYC, because working for a non-profit, you can't beat the price for a decent hotel in that location. During my last stay, I came back from a day out working and almost cried with joy when I saw how much care the maid service took with my belongings when cleaning the room.

So when the hotel we used on our previous vacation to NYC closed, we obviously turned to Tripadvisor to select a new place to stay. All the positive things said about this hotel are true - the water pressure and hot water are just fine and for the noise complaints - I can recommend a great place in Alaska (this is NYC after all). But let's start at the beginning. We arrived early at the hotel after a 23 hour flight (yeah no kidding) and could obviously not check in but they offered to keep our luggage at no cost. After roaming the streets in our ""not so fresh"" state we got our room just after 12:30. Now use your imagination and imagine the smallest a room can be in a hotel. Take half of that and you have the Econo Lodge! These rooms are TINY but they are clean and the bed is comfortable. What more do you need really? So unless you are a little bigger than the average size this hotel is more than adequate to have a good night's sleep and a place to clean up. You will not spend your days in the hotel with the streets of New York calling outside. The breakfasts consisted of a few pastries, bagels, a choice of two cereals, juice, fresh fruit and good enough coffee. No room really to sit downstairs to enjoy the breakfast so most use the tray in the room to carry it back to the room. The hotel staff was in general friendly enough by New York standards. We had a problem with our toilet and this was dealt with promptly. Most people rave about the location and we must also throw our penny's worth in. It is absolutely true that you'll be hard pressed to find a better location for the price. In the heart of the theatre district, one block from restaurant row and Times Square. Across the street is a Duane Reade pharmacy for convenience shopping 24 hours a day. Another little gem is the Food Emporium two blocks north at 49th and 8th. We can really recommend them for a late night snack. Will we stay there again? Absolutely!!

I was at first disappointed not to see a toaster for the bagels, but it turned out they were so good you could just eat them untoasted. Despite reading about complaints on here, the lift was perfectly ok (by British standards).On the down side was the NOISE. Oh-my-god was it loud.

I knew it would be small but I was OK with that because of the price. The room was just big enough to walk around the bed and became a bit cramped with two people. There wasn't really anywhere to store luggage and if you sat at the desk, your guest could not fit to walk by to the bathroom. I would recommend this room to someone who does not plan to stay in the room very much. The biggest problem that I had, is that I never got to take a warm shower. The boiler broke and they had sent people there every day to fix it. It would work at night but when you woke up, the shower would be ice cold. After 4 nights of dealing with the shower, I had to cancel the final 3 nights of the reservation. There were a couple of other issues that are notable. The TV only had about 20 channels and three of those were Bravo, some did not have sound and a couple of the channels like HBO were on the same freeze frame. Also, the room did not have a thermostat so you could not control the heat. There was a widow AC unit. Also, if you plan on sleeping in late, I would not recommend this hotel because the windows are not sound proofed. The traffic noise begins around 7 AM each day. On a positive note, the room was very clean and the staff was nice. The check in and checkout process was not very long. On this trip, I changed my reservation to Hilton Garden Inn, which is about a block and a half away and I would recommend this hotel instead of the Econo Lodge. The room is at least 2 1/2 times larger, the widows are sound proofed, the room has a fridge and microwave and there's more furniture and closets to store your clothes and luggage. There's an ice machine on each floor and they have several fast elevators unlike the Econo Lodge. The staff let us check in before 11 AM even though the reservation was at 3PM. I got this room cheaper than the Econo Lodge on CheapTickets only because we booked it the day of.

The hotel is about 2 blocks off the bright lights and bustle of Times Square, but it was actually a quiet little residential area without a lot of outside noise. Breakfast was great : coffee, juice, tea, cocoa, oatmeal, croissants, bagels with cream cheese or jellies, danishes, muffins, cereals -- lots to pick from. No, there are not tables to eat at, we just brought the stuff back up to our room. They give you discount coupons for a great restaurant around the corner on Restaurant Row when you check in.

The TV was mounted on the wall, but easily viewed from the bed. There was a small armoire (we stored our luggage on top of it) with a few hangers and 2 drawers, and the safe was digital and free to use. There was a shelf above the sink in the bathroom to store cosmetics, and the shower was average-sized. The hotel was VERY clean! Our bed was made and our bathroom was cleaned and restocked every day. The free breakfast was also great - bagels, pastries, coffee, juice, oatmeal, hot chocolate, and fruit. However, there was no microwave or toaster. The staff was extremely pleasant. When we arrived, we found out that they charge to hold luggage - $3 per bag. They told us our room would probably be ready in an hour - so we decided to wait in the lobby - and our room was ready in 20 minutes! The elevator was slow, but they were doing maintenance on it when we left! The location couldn't be better! The only semi-negative thing I can say is that there is an Irish Pub/Bar directly across from the hotel and you can hear people all night (as well as traffic and sirens from the busy street around the corner) -- but, that's all part of the true NYC experience!

It's only 2 blocks from Times Square; across the road you book Gray Line tours; it's just uptown from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. It's local to all theatres which was important to us as we were 2 women who wanted to see some shows and feel safe walking back to our hotel. It's in a safe area.Everyone says that the rooms are small - and they are. We took the advice of a previous contributor and booked a disabled room.

There were sirens all through the night; the pub opposite seemed to have a lot of very noisy patrons who always left in a loud manner; people came up the street with their stereo on full volume all night long. There was no way of blocking the sound as we were there when it was cold so putting on the noisy air con was not an option. I suggest ear plugs if you want a good nights sleep. By night 4, we were so tired that sleeping was easy even with the noise.We were very impressed with New Yorkers who we found to be approachable and helpful - not what we expected at all.

We were pleasantly surprised that the gracious staff allowed us to check-in early (avoiding the customary bag check fee)!! Had enough time to stash our things in the room and proceed to the show. The room was TINY, but we fully expected that (do not stay here if you are claustrophobic!). It was comfortable and clean-----loved the magnifying mirror in the bathroom!!!! Perfect for applying makeup.The following morning we had to be at a TV studio----left around 5:45am and were surprised to see that the continental breakfast was already available----------we thought for sure we'd miss it!

But, thre was one problem at check in. They couldn't give us our room key! The card reader was down and was supposed to be fixed the next day. OK, no problem. Got to our room. Yes, the elevator takes forever like everyone has stated. You could honestly walk up faster. The room is postage stamp size. Actually a similar size to a small cruise ship room. Barely enough room to go around the bed sideways. I'm not kidding. Oh well, knew that coming in too. Friend of mine in NY said that if your door doesn't hit your bed when you come in the room then you have a big room. LOL! But here's where I draw the line. So, it's around 1am and the wife & I turn down the sheets only to find the most horrible stains ever! Disgusting. So we had to sleep on top of the bed sheets since we were really tired and already showered.Next AM, told front desk and they changed them right away for us and gave us a discount card to a restaurant (we never went). Still no keys available. Also, window unit sounded like it was powered by hamsters. Too loud, had to shut off.Saturday night keys became available! But when we came back to the room Sunday we were locked out. Oh yeah, they forgot to tell us that everyday you have to have the room card rekeyed. No big deal if not for the turtle of an elevator they have.And then Sunday night got into the elevator with 3 other couples and got stuck in there for 10 minutes. Won't go up and won't open. Had to use emergency button and then it opened. Funniest thing was girl at counter who said ""Oh you're all back down"". LOL! No we never left! Hey for the $129 a night we paid I got what I expected. A bagel and coffee in the AM, a room I'd be livid with anywhere else but NYC, a great location, & a friendly staff. So I give it mixed reviews.Don't come expecting the Ritz. But if you just need a place to lay your head, take a shower, etc. then it's great. By the way, don't plan on bringing a lot of luggage. You won't have room to put it anywhere.

Given that it's in New York and rooms are typically small and over-priced, this hotel was quite impressive and most certainly a good value. Small room?......yes, but passable. Definitely not over priced (I recall paying $171 plus tax). And very much clean and well-maintained.The staff were friendly and efficient during check-in/out, the hotel was in excellent repair and well presented.The elevator was slow....but given the age of the building and that it's in NY, it was passable.Aside from being small, the room was good...... clean, nice beds, plasma TV, good A/C, well-lit, etc.The continental breakfast consisted of muffins, cereal, toast, and juice (which was good, but in short supply....so I'd recommend going down to the lobby early).All in all, the hotel was an excellent value and had a great location. It's no Ritz Carleton or Crowne Plaza, but certainly above-average for the price and location.

The free continental breakfast was really good and really saved us some money ... which helped with the more expensive dinners and bar (Blue Fin in Times Square) we went to. We watched Hairspray and Beauty and the Beast ... both wonderful!). Shopping is great and subway pretty easy to use.

The window is open to accommodate the AC unit, and cardboards are placed around the AC unit so wind doesn't blow into the room. Needless to say, cardboards do not filter noise, so the experience is as if you were literally on the street. This is pretty outrageous considering the hotel is located on Times Square, which is pretty noisy day in, day out. It is even more outrageous considering that there is a bar right across the street that plays jazz till 4AM. I called the hotel staff to complain, and they told me that it was normal, and that I should live with it. If I didn't have earplugs, I wouldn't have slept at all.Secondly, the bed sheets had big black stains on them, which I realized when I was about to go to sleep. When I complained about this to the hotel staff, they sent someone that handed me new sheets. The new sheets had the same stains, and that person told me that there was no housecleaning service at night and that I was supposed to replace the bedding myself. He left, and while replacing the bedding I realized that the new sheets he gave me were in fact small for my bed!

So, prepare yourself for a little laugh when you walk in, but you will see that these rooms are very well planned out, and they are very functional. The room I had was absolutely perfect for one, and would be a little tight for 2 people, but still very manageable. There is not much room for a lot of suitcases! There was one nice freestanding closet with a room safe in it. The bed took up most of the room but was very comfortable. The pillows were soo nice and very soft! The decor is upscale and the room was very, very clean. The flat screen tv, which is moveable and can be adjusted to be at just the right angle while flipping channels in bed, was a delight. There are many lamp options in the room too, so good lighting was a plus as well. The bathroom, although really small, had great water pressure and even the upscale amenity of a little vanity kit with cotton balls, q-tips and an emery board. The shampoo/conditioner and lotion were very nice Herbal Essence brand. The towels were very soft and smelled like fresh laundry. The only negative note I have about the bathroom was that if you like nice lathering or scented soap, bring your own! The bars they provide are wafer thin, not very scented, and so dry they break in half if you drop them. There was a nice adjustable and reversible magnifying and regular mirror. The snack bag of chips, two mints, and bottled water provided every day were perfect for a snack on the go. The breakfast is very nice and I recommend using the tray from your room to carry items back to your room to eat. The croissants were huge and the muffins delicious. This was a really nice bonus to have breakfast provided since everything is really pricey in NYC. Breakfast was available from 7am til 10am. It was a nice security feature that they re-keyed the door keys every day too. There was an atm in the (small) lobby and a computer for online access (for a fee). The Duane-Reade drugstore right across the street has everything you could ever want in case you forget anything. The was a bit of a downside not having a mini fridge in the room, that would have been convenient. Anyway, this hotel was the perfect location for seeing Broadway plays and for roaming very reasonable walking distances to Times Square and Midtown Manhattan. It feels safe, is in a good area surrounded by gift shops, bars, restaurants and cafes. I would definately stay here again.","Toledo, Ohio","Kelly B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toledo, Ohio</strong>",20,5.0

It was also convenient to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, one of the drop-off spots used by the Airport Shuttle from JFK (which I would highly recommend if you want to save $ by not getting a cab.) Pros of this hotel include:-A fair price for the theater area. We paid ~180 for a room with two doubles. This included a continental breakfast.-Location near theaters, the overrated restaurant row, and a block from a subway line-Pleasant, helpful desk staff- Clean accommodations with sufficient air conditioning-Breakfast with big NYC bagels, juices, coffee, pastries, and fruit that we took along in our daybags.Cons include:-A small room. I've seen worse, though. For two women, the bathroom storage was inconvenient. Hard to find a place to hang our towels.-A charge for baggage storage. I know this is common, but it would be a nice touch if it were included. When we arrived early afternoon - some rooms were ready, and some weren't. Because our double wasn't, we had to pay for bag storage, and we had to pay for it again on check out day, adding $12 to our bill. More inconvenient than the cost is the lack of a changing space or restroom for waiting guests. We felt a little uncomfortable unzipping our suitcases in the small lobby to get our necessities for sightseeing.-8th Avenue Atmosphere. I you haven't been to the Times Square vicinity before, know that 8th Avenue isn't as polished as Broadway. 8th is full of trinket shops and newsstands and lacks charm. We felt safe, and even went to a few bars near the hotel, but I would be a bit uncomfortable walking the area at night if I were traveling solo.-The Elevator! We took the stairs. Thankfully, we were on the 2nd floor.Consensus: Might be worth it if ""Times Square on a budget"" is your agenda. But also check into the Holiday Inn Express, Comfort Inn, Super 8, Hotel Edison, and Radio City Apartments.

Many of the most significant tourist sites in NYC are within a 10-20 minute walk. Given the location, it would be very difficult to find anything less expensive with such accessability to so many places. I paid $125 per night (AAA rate), and that seems like a good deal, especially considering the other big-name hotels nearby charge 2 to 4 times more per night. The staff was friendly and helpful; they even let me use their computer to print out my airplane boarding pass. The continental breakfast was modest but tolerable (large muffins, 2 kinds of cereal, packets of instant oatmeal, bananas, apples, bagles, and juice). The room was tiny. I estimate that the room was not much larger than 100 square feet. The king-sized bed took up nearly all of the floor space. Even by NYC standards, this is quite small; however, I suppose that most people who stay here aren't coming to NY to spend a lot of time in a hotel room, so I will gladly sacrifice a little floor space for extra cash to spend out on the town. There was a nice LG flatscreen TV mounted to the wall; however, the lack of remote control made it inconvenient (had to climb across the bed and reach up to change the channel or volume). I did not notice the slowness of the elevator that others have complained about in other postings here; I even counted. From the time I pushed the button for my floor (2nd floor) to the time it reached the floor and opened the door was 9 seconds; perhaps it takes longer for the upper floors, but it wasn't bad at all for the 2nd floor. There was a little noise at night, but it's like that all through the city. Since this hotel is not right on 8th Ave, but rather 100 feet away from the 8th Ave intersection, much of the loud 8th Ave noise didn't reach the hotel.

We had a family of four and if someone needed to go to the bathroom or wanted to leave the room, everyone else had to get completely on the bed to make room. Our room also happened to be facing 8th avenue and it got really loud till past 2am. The continental breakfast consists of cereal, bad bagels (no cream cheese) and Entemens pastries. However, there’s no place to eat any of these items as the lobby only contains a front desk and no place to sit. The Ugly:The hotel elevator is so slow, that you really think it’s stuck at times. We ended up just taking the stairs, (a stuffy hot stairwell) rather than using the elevator.Summary:I think that they’re really trying to make this a nice place to stay, but when they were remodeling should have tried to make the rooms a bit larger. They just try to cram too much into a small room. If it’s just two of you traveling, and you only plan on sleeping in the room and not spending any time in it otherwise, then this hotel is okay.

I didn't mind it at all because when you go to New York; your not there necessarily to stay inside. The room was barely bigger than a storage closest. This location was right in the heart of everything going on in Times Square and if you are there for theatre performances; it's a great location! The only thing is; if you get there before check in; they do not have a bathroom or a place where you can change your clothes. For example, we paid to check our baggage in because we came straight from the airport dressed in first class business attire. So I ended up going through my bags, pulling out shorts and headed to Toy's R S' bathroom for a quick Clark Kent wardrobe change. Although this is besides the point....I would definitely go back to this hotel. One other thing: I did not like the way Travelocity over charged my card. After checkout, the hotel printed me out my 2 day stay with taxes included for about $215. Travelocity charged an additional $61 dollars. After I called them, they at first acted like my state taxes and other charges were not reflective in what the hotel gave me in the $215. When I told them, Econo Lodge gave me a print out of the state taxes and other charges; they agreed to refund my card the extra 61 dollars. Just beware of booking through 3rd parites or watch your statements closely. Other than that...this Hotel was the bomb!",dallas,"dallasgurl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>dallas</strong>",19,5.0

We stayed at the Econo Lodge the 3rd week of July and have nothing but good things to say about the hotel. The price was very reasonable. I would almost call it cheap. The room was incredibly small….but VERY clean! I was impressed because I am very picky about cleanliness!! The bed was very comfortable. The A/C worked fine, thank goodness because when were there the temperature reached 100 degrees. It was quiet and the people at the front desk were very helpful. The complimentary breakfast was ok. There was always a choice, keep in mind we always made it early…not sure what it would look like later on in the morning. The only negative thing I can say about this hotel that other people might find to be a nuisance was that the elevator was ridiculously slow. We took the stairs to our 3rd floor room every time. We had a great time and we would stay there again.","Kingston, Ontario","EKV100</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kingston, Ontario</strong>",16,4.0

The location is good. The breakfast is convenient, free, and had a great selection. . I should state that even by NYC standards the room was incredibly small. The small window air conditioner made funny noises and kept us up all night, and unfortunately the room never cooled enough. But my biggest complaint, however, was the cleanliness. The room was filthy. Upon entering I saw a large black hair clinging to the lampshade. There was a nichel in between the sheets and the blanket. The sheets has yellowish perspiration stains on them, and few dark curly hairs, and the blanket had a few of those same hairs too. There was NO WAY the sheets had been changed. I couldn't believe it. When I called down to the front desk to ask for more bedding a half and hour later I was still waiting for sheets. I called again and explained that it was after midnight, I was tired and wanted to go to bed and was still waiting for bedding. Bedding arrived 5 minutes later, with a ""here you go"". No offer to change the bedding (we did it ourselves) and no apologies. In the bathroom we found more hair clinging to the wall, as if someone wiped down the wall with a hairly cloth. It was just gross. I am actually not that picky, but I was completely creeped out by how dirtly it was. I suggest if you stay here you keep in mind that you had better be prepared to change the sheets before you sleep on the bed, because clearly they aren't doing it for you on a regular basis.

We were within 3 blocks of 3 subway lines and a block from Times Square, 5 blocks from the Port Authority.- Price. For Midtown Manhattan near Times Square, the price was very good.- Free breakfast. This was a nice touch that was very much appreciated. Trays are provided in the rooms so you can take your breakfast up to your room and eat it there.- Air conditioner. Very useful in humid weather (and to cover the noise from the street at night!)- Cleanliness. The rooms were cleaned daily and they were spotless. A very small bottle of water was left in the room every day.Cons:- Room size. It really is small. The queen bed takes up almost the entire width of the room (save for 5 inches). For a short stay and small suitcases, it's bearable.- Elevator. The slowest elevator we've ever been in. From the time it dinged for our floor (5th) to the time the door opened, we counted 18 seconds!Despite the room size, it really is worth the price simply for location and cleanliness.

After reading some reviews on this site and looking at the location I decided to give the hotel a shot as the PRICE ($180 all in) and location could not be beat. The only picture of the hotel I could find was a picture of the exterior, which made me hesitant to book, as it looks like a corner store rather then a hotel. I decided to look past this and booked regardless. A CAB RIDE from LaGuardia costs about $28-32 each way. When we arrived the HOTEL STAFF were friendly and quick as there was no lines, and we arrived right at check-in time. The ROOM was extremely small but I expected that as all the reviews pointed that out. The room was however, CLEAN and efficient in its use of space with AIR CONDITIONING you controlled. An added bonus was a bag of chips and bottle water left on the desk for free. The LOCATION was excellent.... walking distant to Times Square and most theaters, and near a subway station. We walked everywhere from the hotel on our stay only using the Subway once to get to the south end of the city. My only regret is that I didn’t discover the great restaurants on 9th Street until my last night. The BREAKFAST was basic but good...muffins, cafe, croissants, cereal, fruit and of course coffee and orange juice. The free breakfast must of saved me at least $10 from not having to buy breakfast elsewhere which was a plus. The front desk staff even allowed us on several occasions to use the INTERNET for free. The only NEGATIVES I can think of are the noise level at night from outside, which is quit loud and the elevator was a little slow, but there’s the option of the stairs. We were comfortable with the size of the room but if you have a lot of bags you may find it almost impossible to move.  I was considering staying at a large hotel with more character…I’m glad I looked past the Econo Lodges exterior because I truly had a great stay. If I ever return to New York I would stay at this hotel again. The BONUSES also help in decreasing the costs for a budget traveler with the free breakfast, free Internet, and being able to rely on walking as a form of transportation.",Toronto,"nevets_83</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto</strong>",91,5.0

Everything you've read about the small rooms is true. However there was plenty of room given the short time we were in the hotel. We had four people in our party including our children aged 16 and 19.We were on the fifth floor overlooking 8th avenue and yes it can be a bit loud, but we were so exhausted we slept fine. Next time we'll request a room overlooking 47th street to see if it's any quieter. Noise from other rooms was non-existent.The property was very clean. The hotel staff was superb. The continental breakfast was perfect. The elevator was painfully slow. We always took the stairs when coming downstairs.Our rate was $179.00 plus tax.

It was quite a bargain at $206 considering all of the other hotels were high priced for the weekend. We had read the reviews prior to going and knew that there was no luggage storage so we timed our arrival perfectly and got there shortly after check in. at 3:30p.m after ditching the car in a garage nearby. We walked to everything. This hotel is small but very charming and I found the front desk staff to be friendly and nice. We were able to drop our luggage and find a great place to eat on 9th avenue which is close. I highly recommend Vinyl for a great meal especially if you are a vegetarian. Meat eaters will fare well there too. The hotel is central to not only Times Square and mid town but to Central Park as well. We enjoyed eating breakfast outside at the Applejack Diner on Broadway across from PDiddy's Bad Boy Productions. That is a great place to eat and near the park. We rented bikes and rolled the entire perimeter of Central Park. We caught a great show, ""Hot Feet"" nearby. By the way, Starbucks is right on the corner and in view of the hotel. Sure the rooms at the Econo Lodge are a bit small. You will literally have to climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room. The room is only big enough for two people. I would never take a family there without reserving more rooms. The bathtub is really a square shower. My home clothes closet is bigger than the room which we laughed about. I must say that the room had an iron and ironing board. It had a hair dryer and toiletries in the bathroom. The alarm clock had been set by a previous guest and woke me up at 6AM. I hope they got a kick out of that. The room even had water and snacks. A digitally programmed safe will keep your valuables from harm. They had a flat panel TV mounted on the wall. There was no where else to put it in that shoebox of a room. The air conditioner in the window was small but worked perfectly. We spent very little time in there anyway. The elevator can be busy and slow so I recommend the second floor. You can take the stairs easily. The place is completely new and very clean. I didn't try the morning breakfast but it was available and very continental. It was the perfect NYC getaway on a shoestring.

These observations need not be construed as negatives, as this is still one of the all time great NYC hotel bargains. Everything is new here, including the bright and attractive lobby. The hotel staff is efficient and extroverted and eager to make their guests feel welcome. The room was pleasantly decorated, the bed extremely comfortable, and the compact, amenity laden tile bathroom virtually sparkled in its new incarnation. Housekeeping and maintenance are impressive. The hotel is in an outstanding location and all midtown attractions and restaurants are easily within a short walk. This was the perfect respite for a quick return from the city`s abundant activities and for a good night`s sleep. The included, expanded continental breakfast is an added bonus. The tariff for all this was $126 per night...an amazing bargain for the newness and quality of this property. In a city rife with shabby, expensive lodging, this hotel is a minor miracle. Those who are expecting luxury amenities, such as luggage storage, concierge service, room service, doormen and bellmen need to be paying a lot more than they`re paying here. There are plenty of those kind of options nearby.

They even gave us the front-most room with a great view straight into times square. The workers constantly asked how we were enjoying our stay. Overall I would stay here again in a heartbeat! It was only a block from the middle of times square, in a very safe area, convenient to all of the Broadway shows too. When I go back I will definitely stay here again!","Laguna Hills, California","FrenchFriend</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Laguna Hills, California</strong>",76,5.0
