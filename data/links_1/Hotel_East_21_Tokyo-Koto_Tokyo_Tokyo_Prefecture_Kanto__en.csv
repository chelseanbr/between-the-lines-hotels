Nightly price was very affordable, the amenities offered in the room was probably the best I've had for the price we paid. The room was always nice and tidy, and they always ended up refilling our shampoo/conditioner/body wash-- which was nice because in the U.S., you usually only just get that one travel size bottle. Some reviews complained that the hotel was too far from a metro station, but the walk really wasn't that bad. A big plus was that it was minutes away from a 711 and also inside a plaza. The staff was welcoming and accommodating. We were a party of 2 so we booked the small double room and I do want to point out that the space is very cozy but sufficient. Our room was also nice to have a city view of Tokyo. The hotel also offers shuttles to/from the airport and to/from Disney Sea/Disneyland for a fee, which was super convenient. ",,darlenechou,0,5.0

The gym is an additional payment and I think this should be included in a hotel stay and finally, only one English tv station which is CNN!

The per night cost of the hotel turned out to be a little over 100 USD a night. This is very affordable for a four-star hotel in Tokyo. The nearest subway station takes you straight to downtown, in about 10 minutes, and is about a 10-minute walk from the hotel. The neighborhood looks quiet but it surprisingly is teeming with a lot of office workers during rush hours. The hotel offers complimentary transfers to the subway station at set times. The hotel itself reminds one of the big urban hotels of the 1990s. Not to worry though, everything is kept spic and span. The hallways always had a faint smell of fragrance, which is perfect. The rooms are made up daily with nothing left untouched (even brochures which had been lying about had been stacked in order). There are a lot of in-room amenities, including a fabric freshener. Most 5-star hotels don't even have the same amount and variety of amenities. If I have to think of a downside, it would be the modest size of the standard rooms (higher categories seem to be on par with hotels of the same class), but such is the norm in Japan.","Luzon, Philippines","horacecima</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Luzon, Philippines</strong>",28,5.0

The hotel has restaurants but you can go around for eating as there is a small commercial center just downstairs with restaurants, cafes and supermarket, very convenient. If you go to Tokyo, maybe the only thing would be walking for 15 min (dragging a heavy bag maybe tough) to the subway station or if you decide to take a bus(challenging for foreigners). There is a bus to the airport and they have shuttle service to the subway station but early in the morning...they have a shuttle bus also for Tokyo Disneyland for the ones interested.

We learned of it the day of our departure which happened to be the day after typhoon Kazai and public transportation was quite disturbed. Luckily the concierge had reliable info on the metro network status. Still at check-in the employee did not bother to tell us much, maybe because of his poor english (I don’t blame him though but her mgmt). So we also found out by chance that the hotel was on the route of a semi-express bus to Tokyo Skytree and Odaiba, and that the fare could be paid with regular transport cards (e.g Suica) ... these are 2 major attractions that we visited on our own.Lastly the surcharge to access the garden pool: over 30 euros pp on week days and over 55 euros pp on weekends is simply a rip-off considering the room rate!

It will cost my family around £80 a day extra if I wish to go for a dip in my pool on what is already a very expensive trip. At the weekend this is around £110. We intend to do lots of sight seeing of course so there is no option to go for an hour to unwind later. These are all import considerations. The only outdoor space to sit and unwind is the pool garden and you have to pay the fee. If you wish to sit in any lounge area in the hotel you must buy food or drink. There are a couple of seats in the lobby. The rooms are tiny and is the only place we can chill when wanting to rest from sight seeing so it is very claustrophobic for a family.

They provide free shuttle to nearest train stations too. Anyway, we took our morning walk to Toyocho station everyday as it is less than 10mins walk away. We also took the paid shuttle to Odaiba which takes less than 20mins compared to taking train which would take longer. The hotel area has some restaurants and Lawson is just nearby.

There was still space to move and store our luggage which is amazing!Hotel lobby looks grand and ""expensive"" which is why I prefer small hotels for their quaint, cozy spaces. We got a bit confused at first when we reached the hotel because apparently the lobby is not on the ground level, but it's one floor up the escalator which we didn't easily see at night.It has a lot of eating places below the hotel. They also have a close by Family Mart and Lawson.The only drawback is that it's not really close to a train station (10-15 mins walk).

Asian selections are numerous. The rooms are typical of Japan, small but very clean and well maintained. A bit basic but perhaps because I just get the single corporate rate room. It’s still nice tho. My only complaint is that for me, the bed is extremely firm. A bit too firm for my taste. Access to subway station is only a couple blocks, 5-10 min walk at most. From there, anywhere is easily accessible a fairly short ride away. Subways are very easy to navigate and cheap. There are many resturants nearby, of all different types, several in the same complex.

The beds are not queen size but held two non skinny persons very comfortably. The room size is not the normal American room, but it was very clean, there was enough space and all we needed was there. electric hot water kettle, teas, Japanese style cups, TV, mini fridge, comfortable bed and linens. Fabulous Japanese Toto toilet, and brand name toiletries. The wash clots were disposable and a new hermetically sealed one was placed each day as well as sealed toothbrush and paste, Q tips daily and soft cloth covered bands to put up your hair, shaver. Room and bath room super clean. We arrived late at night and check-in was a breeze. My sisters luggage was destroyed by the airline. The next morning they helped her to contact the airline and spoke on her behalf.. Everyone was professional, nicely dressed and so very helpful.. You can walk to the Seven 11 and downstairs in a public space where there is a noodle shop, Burger King ,Tully's;, a full American laid out type Drug store, and other shops, including an Italian restaurant.. The Breakfast places don't open much before am. The only downside is the cost of breakfast if you choose to eat there at the 21.. Lobby is pretty. The bell service great...no tipping. They bring your luggage to curbside when your transportation arrives. Stayed in many 5 star hotels all over the world including Hong Kong and found Hotel East 21 holds its own exceptionally well. The price is very affordable for all you get. This is no ""rinky dink"" hotel. Feel comfortable booking it. . I would stay there again. It is a about an hour from the cruise pier and in not too near to downtown (central) Tokyo. We stayed 3 nights. Were we to return they have our vote.. . The guest who did recommend was accurate about them not encouraging the lounge /bar for causal sitting, but a minor detail for us. We never worried about the TV and it is Japan where they do not do large and extra large, so small trash bins and a smaller than usual room is within the cultural norm of a primarily Japanese hotel.. We had many people who spoke English and for me who resides in the USA in Miami, Florida where English is a foreign language it was pleasant to speak and be understood or not rudely told that they don't speak English.

Some good things are the fact that it is surrounded by a supermarket, coffee shops and restaurants of all kinds (however, it takes between 7-10 min to walk to get to Toyocho train station, the closest to hotel). Also, it is good that the Airport Limousine Bus from/to Narita and Haneda Airport stops here. The concierge service is good and they were efficient in booking our Airport Limousine Bus tickets and giving us the right information about things related to Tokyo. Room service was also good, they responded immediately.Unfortunately, the good things end here. There are a lot of things that are not matching average international standards. If the service continues this way, I don't see how the hotel can attract international visitors for the Rugby World Cup 2019 and the Tokyo Olympics 2020. These are the things were the hotel did not do well during our stay:1) Since we traveled with a 1-year old kid, the hotel installed a child guard in one of the beds. The problem was that one day after staff cleaned the room, the child guard was installed in the wrong way, there was a big hole and our son could have fallen through it.2) After check-in, we noticed our room had not been cleaned properly, we found a sock from a previous guest behind a sofa.3) This is the only hotel in the world that I know where guests have to pay to use the gym4) After we checked-out, the front desk forgot to give us a parcel that a friend had sent to us. They only noticed after we had arrived to the airport and they had to send it to us by airmail.(They acknowledged they forgot to give it to us)5) Staff in the lobby lounge were not considerate. One morning, my son asked me to take him to the fountain in the lounge lobby. The lounge was almost empty, one two tables taken. I sat with my son in a sofa next to the fountain and I am asked what I wanted to order. When I told them I was just staying here for my son to watch the fountain, they asked us to leave the lobby lounge, no matter I explained we were staying in this hotel. 6) Some staff in the front desk cannot understand English well.7) Trash bins in the hotel rooms are too small.8) Only one English channel on TV (CNN)My advice is to only stay here if you did not find accommodation in another hotel in Tokyo and/or you have to do something around Koto, Toyocho area","Singapore, Singapore","CKuriyama</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",68,2.0

Only concerns we had during the trip were a couple of nights when we had some really loud people partying in surrounding rooms which impacted on our sleep, but, can't really blame the hotel for other guests selfish behaviour. Hotel is now non-smoking, but, as a non-smoker, I could still smell remnants of when it used to be smoking, but, this is something you are going to encounter in most Japanese hotels - certainly wasn't overpowering and didn't affect our stay - you can tell a real effort is made to continually ventilate the property to get rid of remnant smells. One thing that is an area for improvement - the free shuttle to the subway only runs in the morning. Given that check in is 2 or 3pm, this is not helpful in transporting bags between the station and hotel, nor does it help at the end of a long tiring day when you are faced with that 800m walk.

We booked the family room which had 4 beds so although the adults were also in single beds, it was very comfortable and quite spacious, especially considering Tokyo size rooms. We had a little table were we ate the nights that we were too exhausted to go out and a fridge. A walking closet and plenty of tables/night stands. Large windows that although you cannot open, had incredible views. Lots of sunshine. Large bathroom with the typical extras on toilet features so the little one kept pushing the warming toilet seat button :)Breakfast was included and excellent considering we were in Asia. Both, Asian and Western options available. Very good espressos and lattes. Service at the restaurant was quick to replace items and the kids ate eggs in every imaginable form of cooking so they were happy. Fresh fruit and all sort of pancakes, waffles, etc.The hotel had a bit of 80/90's look but all was very well maintained. Few options around in case you are tired at night to have dinner or shop to take to your room. Once night we just grabbed chicken sandwiches from BK and were happy with those. After all the walking with the kids, by night, we had very little energy to do much more. They offered a trip to the Tokyo Tower. I didn't go buy my husband/kids enjoyed the views but also mentioned that they kept asking for more and more money to get higher in the tower so find out exactly what is offered before going. They also took a long time to get back. Tube is around 400 mtrs (4 blocks) away. Not too far but something to take into consideration.","London, United Kingdom","Solci13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",114,4.0

Being part of an inclusive tour we didn't pay direct to the hotel but as our tour was mid-range I have assumed the hotel cost would be mid-range. The tour company transferred us from the airport but I did notice that the hotel arranges airport transfers. The hotel staff were the usual friendly, helpful and accommodating Japanese standard (so wish this was the standard in UK). Our room was on 14th floor, there were another 3 or 4 floors above, we were lucky to look towards the Sky Tower dominating the skyline in the distance. This was an absolutely fantastic view, especially at night and we had a couple of evening picnic meals in the room looking at the view. In room eating is obviously expected as paper plates and chopsticks are provided. On the catering front, also provided are bottle opener, corkscrew, beer glasses, wine glasses (nice proper glasses), kettle but only 4 japanese tea bags and no teaspoons. The room was not large, possibly slightly too small for the 6 foot wide bed, two 3 foot mattresses with one large duvet, which was comfortable. There was a desk chair, a tub chair and a coffee table, eminently suitable for our picnics. The toiletries were comprehensive and nice quality, also disposable toothbrushes, razors, combs; there were robes and slippers provided and a hairdryer. There was a small fridge but no mini bar, suits us. Wifi was free and worked well. Generally everything was in very good condition not worn out, the carpet was showing signs of wear but within acceptable levels, can't expect everything to be brand new. There was a full size, deep bath with a shower over and a very novel toilet with heated seat and integral bidet with heated water! Everything immaculately clean.Breakfast was buffet with Japanese and western fare with an egg cooking station. The bread & pastries did all run out one morning and took 5 -10 minutes to be replenished but overall good.There is a large supermarket almost directly attached to the hotel.The nearest underground train station is 7-8 minutes walk away, the hotel does run a free shuttle.

The hotel is very clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. I fell asleep instantly there. I booked a Standard Single Room (like last year- small by US standards) but I was unexpectedly upgraded to a Deluxe Double Non-Smoking room. In-room Wi-Fi works fine (having access to Google was very welcome), and the mini-refrigerator works great, around the clock. Hotel provides complimentary bottled water and a nice set of toiletries, including a folding travel-sized hairbrush (yours to keep). The hotel offers a free Tokyo Disneyland/DisneySea shuttle, as well as a free shuttle to the Tokyo Metro Toyocho Station. That's very convenient on checkout day, so you don't have to schlep your own luggage down the street for 10 minutes walking to Toyocho Station. The Limousine Bus stops at Hotel East 21 twice a day. For a much better price (less than $15 each way) you can take Tokyo Metro at Toyocho Stn. to Nihombashi Stn, and then take the Toei Asakusa Line/Narita Sky Access train to the Narita airport. There's a small mall in the immediate area that has several restaurants, a Burger King, a pharmacy, and a bank of gachapon (toy capsule) machines. Also nearby is a Family Mart and a 7-Eleven for quick on-the-go eats, which are, BTW, of better food quality than anything a US 7-Eleven offers.

Access is straightforward after getting off Toyocho station. Head for Exit 1 and once you are on the ground level , look out for the 100yen shop that should be visible from the traffic junction. Cross over to the side where the shop is and walk along the path. It should take you about 8-10 mins walk to reach the hotel. You will pass by two 7-11 convenience stores after which you will see the hotel on your left along with a office building next to it. The hotel sits on top of a neighborhood mall where there is a good selection of restaurants as well as a supermarket and a pharmacy.This hotel appears ""grand"" and not the typical tourist class hotel in Tokyo. However , it is kind of dated as observable from the design and condition of the furnishing. That perhaps explain why the price is not as steep as equivalent ones that have been renovated and in a more convenient location. Our family of four was given a room on the 16th floor with a direct view towards the Tokyo Skytree. The room is comparatively huge by Tokyo standard and we have 4 single beds nicely layout to fit everyone. There is still space for 2 mid to large size luggages. I would give it a 5 stars rating as far as room functionality is concerned.The hotel provides an hourly free shuttle to the Toyocho station in the morning up to noon time. There is also a courtesy shuttle to Disneyland parks for hotel guests that is vey handy for those planning to spend some time at the theme park. More importantly , this is also a stopover point for the airport bus limousine service which saves me a lot of hassle when I depart for Haneda Airport. I believe the shuttle bus to Narita Airport is also available from this hotel.

Just arrange with the concierge the departure time from the hotel and the pick up time from Disney Resort. We love the surroundings because it gives you a subtle side feeling of Tokyo. Within the hotel grounds, you might already find what you need, we frequented this place everyday. There is a supermarket where you can buy everything from food, water, chocolates, and all sorts of Japanese products. There is a Create drug convenience store where you can buy face mask (during spring), beauty products, medical products, and many things. There is Saizeriya, a value for money Italian restaurant, always a good place to eat. There is a dollar store. When we arrived at the hotel from Narita, we immediately tried the ramen restaurant nearby, it was great. There is a Japanese shabu-shabu restaurant which we had a great experience dining. Burger King. We also had a good time at the nearby Volks, a family restaurant specializing in steaks. And many more shops just within the surroundings of the hotel. The hotel is also very near the Tokyo Skytree tower, where you can get a breathtaking view of Tokyo, I suggest to go there in the evening to see the city lights. Fantastic. To go around Tokyo, it is best to take the Metro trains, and the Toyocho station is just 15 - 20 minutes walk from the hotel.Our family size is four adults and the hotel had a room for us that has four beds! We were surprised with the spacious room and the free WIFI is fast. We loved the bathroom amenities, the nice smelling shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. I wish I could have asked the hotel if I can buy a set to take home. You always get a warm and comfortable feeling whenever you use the toilet. The beds are comfortable. There is a TV where you can watch local cable channels and prepaid movies.

The room, as with the whole hotel, was spotlessly clean and comfortable. Room size was, I would say, generous for Tokyo. A bit of maneuvering was required in the bathroom to get into the shower, avoiding the door and toilet. Much fun was had, as always, playing with the electronic toilet. The view from my twelfth floor window over this part of Tokyo was spectacular.The hotel had a wide range of excellent facilities, none of which I used. The wi-fi was generally reliable.I avoided using the lobby bar, as it was always devoid of other people, possibly down to high prices. I never quite made it up to the cocktail bar on the 21st floor, preferring to explore the city.Personally I found the location to be convenient enough. It is a little bit 'out East' if Shinjuku or Shibuya is your bag, perhaps 45 mins on the Metro avoiding rush hours (which you would be wise to do). But Shimbashi, Ginza and Tsukiji are all within easy reach. The Tozai line (Toyocho station) is an easy & pleasant five minute walk away. For those quiet nights or if you wish to avoid elbowing your way through central Tokyo, the area around East 21 has plenty of options - places to drink a beer, more choice in restaurants than you could ever need, small shops and good coffee for the morning.I'd happily stay with East 21 again.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","raptorman44</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",17,4.0

Part of the mirror also had heaters to prevent fogging.Hotel StaffThe staff we spoke with all tried to understand our English with the Filipino accent. They would also try to converse with us in English. If it seemed that we didn't understand each other, they would make the effort to explain directions to us to make sure we do not get lost. There were a few things we didn't fully understand but that's totally forgivable given the language barrier.TransportationThe hotel was close to Disney and there was even a free bus from the hotel to the resort. It was also just around 30-40minutes to Haneda airport. However, it was a long 15-20 minute walk to the nearest subway so we ended up taking the taxi a lot. It helped that they have estimated costs and arrival time for all the transportation available. Other transfers and tours are offered at the hotel lobby. Just don't forget to ask if you need to pay for them.ConvenientI think it was very convenient that there was a small commercial area within the hotel's property. We were very close to restaurants allowing me to sneak in sushi while my mom was already in the room. When I was feeling cheap, I could even get sushi or dinner from the supermarket nearby.

They take advance bookings each day till 3pm at a separate desk from the reception. They will show you different time slots and where you need to wait for the bus at the resort for the return trip. It takes about half an hour to get to/from Tokyo Disneyland, and slightly longer to get to/from Tokyo Disneysea.What are provided in the room: bedroom slippers (changed daily), Shishedo brand of face/hand soap, shampoo, rinse (ie hair conditioner) and body soap, shower caps, toothbrushes and toothpaste, hair rubber band, kettle, tea sachets, sleeping robes (fastened by buttons instead of just with a sash so they feel more secure!), bath tub, strong wifi (in room only !! Not elsewhere in the hotel).What we would have liked: a safe.Breakfast is buffet style. There is Japanese food, rice porridge, bread and jam, cereals, pancakes, food cooked the Asian way, and an egg station where a chef prepares scrambled egg of your choice, or sunny side up. Or you can take a hard boiled egg from the station. There is a decent variety but the food is about the same each day so if you stay for more than a few days you may find it boring.The reception is on level 2.

The made-in-Japan ones are the best).Ask at the Front Desk for a map – it shows the opening hours of all the eateries there and also directions to the nearest metro station (Toyocho; about 10minutes’ brisk walk away; there is a shuttle that takes you to the station too but I think it does not operate on weekends).We were there when the 8.5 strong earthquake struck in the ocean. There were a few announcements….all in Japanese so we were rather lost. Only the final one was made in English as well. We would have expected them to make announcements in a few languages besides Japanese, depending on the nationality of the guests who are staying there at the time.To summarise, it is well contained and a good economical alternative to a Disney hotel but if your intention is to be right in the heart of the action then this hotel is slightly out of the way.",Singapore,"NonDScript</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",74,4.0

Room are decently sized (believe me, I have stayed in several Tokyo hotels and many have rooms the size of a shoebox) but we traveled in a group of 3 and added an extra bed - the room became rather packed with not much space for luggage. Pic attached.Note that there is a possibility of adding 2 extra beds (1 at walkway perpendicular to beds), our neighbor did that but they probably slept with their luggages at the door or on their beds.Bathroom was very clean & well stocked with supplies including Shiseido face wash. Wireless internet available but not stable (I was way faster on phone's 3G than wifi). F&B: There's a supermarket right below the hotel (tip: buy cheap sushi there & be sure to grab some of those Jap mangoes, strawberries, honeydew! They're mad sweet & cheap at the supermarket!), a 100-yen store in the supermarket, some restaurants, Burger King etc. Restaurants are also available across the road.Location: It's far from.. City places like Shinjuku/ Shibuya etc. but near Disney. Hotel bus ride to Disney takes around 15 mins, but please book your bus trip in advance if you're using hotel shuttle to Disney. Late rides to return after the Disney fireworks show are usually full a few days in advance. However, if you booked a later ride & would like to hop onto an earlier bus from Disneyland - that's also possible, they're rather flexible. The hotel also provides shuttle services to the nearest subway station (Toyocho) as well as airport buses. Ask for the bus schedules at concierge.Train from airport to hotel with several station changes took about an hour.Hotel is about 10 mins walk from the nearest subway station, no problems for leisure walking but we had some situational grumbles - like when walking there dragging 2 full luggages per person or when our legs were breaking after a full day shopping. Service was great, though they sent me back to the room when I was in slippers to smoke downstairs once. Slippers not allowed downstairs, I was told.Overall above average and value for money but won't return for my next stay.. cause of its location.

They have a shuttle that leaves pretty regularly to take you to the local Toyocho station as well as some other places I believe. This is a huge bonus for lazy folk like me and is super handy when the weather stinks. I'm pretty slow so for me the walk is about 10-15 mins. The hotel is close to many restaurants that are reasonably priced. Last night we tried a soba restaurant and it was both amazing and cheap. There are a few convenience stores close which has some great snacks. I think Lawsons makes some great sushi. As far as the hotel in general goes, I'm not enjoying the bed, it's very hard and we both woke up with sore backs. It is very quiet and cozy, no annoyances. As far as amenities goes it's pretty on the low side, but you don't come to Tokyo to hang out in your hotel. Maybe bring some tea bags if you're a fan because they charge you for those. Internet access is okay but meh at times. I'm still enjoying my visit so if anything else comes up I will add. Also if you haven't been to Japan before I highly recommend learning to say a few things in Japanese, it really goes a long way here and it's nice to show the locals you have gone to some effort My Japanese has really gone over well! .I also recommend getting a Suica or Passmo card for the trains, it's a much easier way to pay your fare!

Bathrooms have all the usual immaculate Japanese fittings that i have grown to like so much... the bathroom has a well stocked bar(for the lack of a better word).. (the best i have seen in my decades of travelling) with pink and white hair bands as well as hair clips for the ladies.. now if only my wife was travelling with me in this trip i know she would have been delighted to see it as she often keeps forgetting her hair accessories.Rooms: relatively spacious.. bit dated like most tokyo hotels i've stayed in, but reasonably spacious.. if you want a WiFi Connection the front desk will provide you with your own Router (returnable at the end of stay) Location: for me close to my office so i am happy.. plenty of taxi's around.. train station is a 5 min walk.. located in the east part of the city i guess its good for those who want to go to Disneyland... beds are nice and comfortable...TIP: try to get the rooms facing the tokyo TV tower.. its a beautiful view at night!!","Singapore, Singapore","Farawayjfk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",86,4.0

East 21 boasts a beautiful outdoor swimming pool. On June 15, 30°C, they told me it's closed because it's not summer yet (only August, they say). I see it from my room, there's a wedding party there (see photo), which they earn a lot from, I guess. They tell me there's an indoor pool open, I go there ready to swim and they ask me 4,200 Y (42 US$!) to enter. Same for the gym.Breakfast is 22 to 30 US$!Location also not good. To any place in central Tokyo, it's 40 to 90 min., 1 to 3 changes through the metro lines. 1h 15' min. to Shinagawa station to catch a train for other cities.I suggest the Shinagawa Prince instead, which was fully booked this time, but I staid there before: quick metro to anywhere, pool and tea are for free. At East 21 they even charge you 200 yen (2 US$) if you use the single tea bag provided to make yourself a tea. Only hotel in Asia (I've been in 14 this trip, all with with free pool, gym, tea, water) where they don't give you even a bottle of water free.","Genoa, Italy","luca l</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Genoa, Italy</strong>",4,1.0

Our hotel was changed at the last hour as we reached Tokyo and members of the group were justifiably upset until they checked in at East 21. In the end almost everyone was happy to be in this hotel. The hotel is great and rooms very comfortable. We had a great view of the Tokyo Sky tree at night. The breakfast laid down at the ground floor restaurant had wide and quality selection. Great ambience. Staff in the restaurant was courteous and helpful too. Very pleasant experience overall. Needless to say that like other Japanese hotels we stayed in this hotel too had elegant, and very clean bathroom. Great smelling freshly washed towels and well stocked toiletry.

A good breakfast spread. Located at a beautiful and quiet area slightly away from the busy Ginza area. A Metro station about 8 mins walk allows us to travel conveniently to other parts of Tokyo. Best part for me is the supermarkets right next to the hotel. Convenient for a late night snack. The annex also has several eateries - a burger king and subway outlets, a western restaurant, a sushi bar and several small n medium sized japanese restaurants. There is also a Middle Eastern restaurant about 10 mins walk left to the hotel where you can get other Asian staples such fried rice and Indian cuisine.","Singapore, Singapore","dahliayusof</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",11,4.0

The room is spacious and clean and the room I had has a good view of the ferris wheel (a bit far though) and the morning sun rise is so beautiful. There are free Lan service in the room (not wireless), but you can loan a router from the front office and instruction for setting up is available in English. With this router, you can convert your room to wireless. Please be noted there are no safe in the room, but they have a safe keeping available in the front office.Daily breakfast is a buffet style of Western and Japanese breakfast. Though most of the dishes remains the same with a bit of changes throughout my 5 days of stay, but the food is good. You must definitely try their 5 Grains Porridge which is so well done. The staffs in the restaurant is very friendly, especially the cook at the egg counter. I remembered asking him for Onsen Tamago (Spa cooked egg) one of the morning which is not available, he remembered me and when I go down for my breakfast the next day, he stopped me and passed me an Onsen Tamago which he specially kept aside for me. I was really impressed by his service. There are quite a few restaurants available just outside the hotel. There's a super market there too which is very convenient. The Metro service is just 7-8 mins walk away from the hotel and along the way there are many shops and fast food available too. With the Metro service, you can travel to the city easily.This is really a nice hotel and I would love to go back again.","Singapore, Singapore","rosa_koko</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",11,4.0

There is a large outdoor pool, a good sized indoor pool and a well-equipped gym in the fitness center, but there is a rather high fee for using these facilities (4,200 yen for hotel guests). A wide variety of both Japanese and western food is available on the breakfast buffet.

The hotel is located in Toyo-Cha about a 7 or 8 minute walk to the Metro station.When you walk in the hotel lobby is nice enough with a big bar in the front and the desk at the back wall. Check in went well. You need to ask for internet access at this point as they will have someone bring up a modem to hook up in your room. This is the cheapest internet that I have ever paid for. It was somewhere around $3 a day which is less than a quarter of what it usually is in North America.As with many Asian hotels the rooms are quite small as is all the things within it. The bed is a small single that was long enough for my 6' frame. The like extremely firm beds in Asia and this was no exception. No such concept of pillow top or Heavenly bed here. Luckily I like firm beds so I had no issue.The work desk is also very small which makes it hard to lay things out. I had my laptop on it and combined with the modem they provide it doesn't leave a lot of room. The internet connection was one of the best I've ever used. Latency and delays were non-existent. I used my soft phone capability on my laptop to phone back through my company phone system and the people on the other end thought I sounded like I was next door and the delay was not noticable.The washroom was small but still had enough room to move around. As with many Japanese toilets this one had a heated seat and a bidet function. I personally don't like warm toilet seats as it leaves a very negative connotation in my head so I looked to find out how to turn that portion off. In order to do so you have to lift up a flap on the back right of the controls that are on your right. Just be careful not to turn on the bidet!There are multiple restaurants and bars in the hotel. Nothing is cheap as you would expect in Tokyo. The restaurant in the lobby the left of the check in is where they had a good buffet for breakfast each morning with North American and Japanese items. All were excellent quality so we had breakfast there each day.We also saw the bar on the top floor but drinks are expensive as you are paying for the ambience and not the drink really. We also tried the top floor Japanese restaurant for lunch. We had a traditional Japanese bent lunch and it was quite good except for a few things I wasn't really sure what they were. Also quite expensive.The TCAT bus which brings you to and from the airport picks up directly from this hotel and you can pick up tickets downstairs. It appears this hotel is the last stop so you go directly from the hotel to the airport on this bus. Very convenient compared to coming in from the airport using the TCAT which brings you to the station and you have to take a 10 minute cab ride to the hotel.All in all it is a good hotel. Only problem you will find here and most places in Tokyo is the porportion of people who smoke is very high compared to North America but like I said, it is not isolated to this hotel.","Vancouver, Canada","warmhappyfeet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",74,3.0
