I requested my luggage be taken to my room and this bellhop was a lot nicer and offered some great tips on local things to see and do in the area. The other standout was your housekeepers. They were always friendly and did a great job servicing the room. The breakfast was worthwhile if included. The pool was freezing and not usable.

At first I was super excited- had booked a king size bed with what seem like a whole other room with a pull out bed. Two decent size TVs in each room. And the free dvd service is an interesting touch. I even had 2 lanais.What they absolutely lost me was their bathroom. It does not match up with the feel of the “resort”. The sink is the cheapest and smallest sink you can buy that is only meant for washing your hands. The mirrors are awkward and faces each other but not you. There is virtually no counter space! What kind of bathroom is this? They could have easily taken some space from the extra room to make a bigger bathroom.Oh and so the hotel room also has a kitchenette with a sink. Brilliant me thought to myself, let me use the sink there instead (because I felt like I was going to bash my head on the sink whenever I wash my face or brush my teeth). The kitchenette’s sink doesn’t even turn on the correct way! I took a video to demonstrate the awkward way to turn the faucet on.After 3 days I couldn’t stand the sink situations and asked the front desk on a Thursday if I could change my room. The woman responded that they are fully booked (ok I can understand that) but also “all the bathrooms are the same. I can try to get you another room but the sink is the same”. I told her I saw the website, that is not true. But she insisted and said she will look into it but I highly doubt it. I can’t wait to get the hell out of here. All the amazing reviews here may be true but was not my experience. There are pros and cons but the bathroom is too big of a con for me.

I was surprised that I was upgraded to the nicer corner room with an amazing view of the ocean. I realized that other oceanview rooms may not have as nice of view as mine because of the high rises blocking some of the rooms. I was high enough to see above and peak between 2 buildings. The hotel was situation about a block from the beach which made it nicer than the hotel where the conference was held. The room came with a free DVD rental from downstairs (DVD Now). I didn't frequent the restaurants in the hotel, but I also got discounts for those as well as for in-hotel car rental. I was really close to so many nice restaurants that I hit Morimoto on my first night and concluded my trip with Momosan (should've tried here more!). These were few minutes walking distance. I was near everything! I was close enough to Queen's beach for morning yoga sessions. The room was so spacious that I was able to do morning yoga in my room while looking at the ocean from the balcony. I wish I could've heard the waves, but I think that's impossible in Waikiki with so much traffic and people. The staff was pleasant, and I had daily housekeeping. The room had a fridge and microwave which made my life super easy.

Nancy at the desk was wonderful and very helpful. They have 2 places to eat in the hotel one is a basic breakfast lunch and a Koren place that was very good, and bar that serves small plates. They also have Massage Spa too! We did the Pearl Harbor Tour of the Arizona and it was great! We loved the tour guide as he was fun and very knowledgeable. I learned a lot about the history of Hawaii which was cool! However, there are a few things that need to be addressed, There towel system is the pits! You must go down to the basement to get and return towels which is a pain especially if have with knee injuries, as i do. I suggested they put a hamper near the stairs to return towels so you are not going up & down. I forgot to get our towels a few times because it out of sight and had to go all the way back to the hotel to get them. On our last day I took the towel from the room so I did not have to go back and forth. Worked great! The other issue we endured as my husband has back pain now and cannot walk very well. They are not well equipped to cater to the unimpaired or handicapped. There was not one holding bar anywhere in the bathroom and my husband feel in the tub because there was nothing to hold to & he broke a few of the plastic shower curtain hooks and the towel rack because there was nothing to grab. They were very good about as I did report the issue and they fixed those items right away with any hassle. Another thing is the toilet was too low and hard to stand especially with anyone with a disability, & the door was so close to the toilet you could not open the door inward, you can only close it all the way unless you are using it. Poor designing there. The pool are is nice & they have nice loungers, but the water is SO cold you cannot stay in too long and they have no spa tub. The sun does not hit the pool til like noon as the building block it until it comes up. Also beware you must pay to use the chairs & umbrellas on the beach. 2 lounge chairs and umbrella will set you back back $60 bucks! Way too expensive if you ask me. We did it the first day but when I went by myself I asked for one chair only they charged me $25.00. They next time I went it was $20.00......then $15.00 as I only stated 1/2 day only.

We got some great advice on tours and helped with the coordination of activities, while Kenneth at concierge was very helpful in storing our luggage.The only thing I didn't like was the pool was very cold and not heated so we could not use it, however, the beach towel service was very handy for our beach time. The location of the hotel is perfect! Off the main street but a 1-minute walk to the beach.Thank you to the staff at the Waikiki Resort Hotel - you made our trip worthwhile and special.","Vancouver, Canada","MichelleMolli</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",0,5.0

Firstly, the bathroom had a half size bathtub with the shower, normally a deal breaker right there as I will often struggle to get in and out of it because I’m not tall. To add to that the grout was mostly brown and needed a good scrub. The safe was too high for me to see what was in it. The quality of the food for breakfast offered was ordinary. Lastly, and this is something trivial I know but we had read that kettles were available for tea and coffee which we hadn’t had at American hotels before. A new kettle arrived which was great but they only supply 1 bag of green tea and earl grey tea. So I asked for black tea and was told no that’s it.

For this trip in August we chose the Waikiki Resort Hotel to be closer to the beach & for better views; We assumed that accommodations would be similar. There is NO comparison. The Waikiki Resort rooms pictured are EXTREMELY enhanced and this place is maybe a 1 Star at best and very misrepresented in its advertising. The curb appeal of the property says “vintage” but at a closer look vintage begins to look more like significantly aged and in desperate need of an update & repair. The hallways are dingy, poorly lit, excessively humid, noisy, and brimming with various pungent odors. Yes, the halls are open-air exposed at the ends but the air within them is not circulating at all.  As for the guest rooms. the door exteriors are scuffed with black marks and dirty. The interior carpet is vacuumed and the bed neatly made but the carpet, headboards, bedspreads, wallpaper & most of the other decor is circa 1970’s, extremely “weathered” & very well worn in appearance while screaming I contain 50 years of dust mite debris. Our room view was even better than we expected but unfortunately the hotel ventilation and extreme humidity problems go beyond the hallways and are a significant concern throughout the building; especially in the guest rooms. The air handling system does not appear to be able to keep up with/control the demands of the island humidity and when viewing the room vents for the air handler (which are also broken & bent) extremely dirty & lack of maintenance to the system is easily visible to the naked eye. Upon entering the bathroom We were surprised (shocked) to see that the original scratched and worn shower basins were in place with the old-time rubber mats to stick in the bottom of the shower (gross) but we were even more appalled to discover black mold on the ceiling. Due to chronic illness black mold exposure will hospitalize 1 of us (me) & completely ruin our trip. Fortunately the staff was EXTREMELY kind and understanding. They attempted to show us another room but the same black mold problem was still there. The staff SINCERELY apologized and asked if there was anyway they could rectify the situation to accommodate us; when we explained that once it is airborne it’s just to big of a risk, especially for a 9 day stay they fully understood & gave us a full refund. As 20% of the population suffers from a genetic weakness causing severe mold toxin illness, anyone who has been through cancer treatment, has other illnesses that has left them with a compromised immune system, or a sufferer of airborne allergies the air quality and age of the living decor absolutely matters! This hotel really needs to update the air handling system, replace room carpeting & eliminate the “grass-textured” wallpaper as these can all readily hold mold spores to regenerate & the age of them also significantly increases allergen issues as a whole.... The property is in a great location but “buyer beware” the Waikiki Resort Hotel is completely unfit to accommodate anyone with a compromised immune system or airborne allergies! Lastly, this week is extremely busy on the island of Oahu, there were literally no rooms the 1st night til I’ll called around and found a cancellation at 7:30pm at night... we almost ended up sleeping in our car! Beyond that they’re were 2 hotel options for the rest of the week at 3 or 4xs the $$$... our budget is blown but our accommodations look like what we expected at the Waikiki Resort Hotel... however it’s called: the MARRIOT!!!","Hollywood, Florida","BuffCritique</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hollywood, Florida</strong>",2,1.0

Check in was quick and easy- however I had called and requested a crib and “quieter” room a few days before. I also confirmed my requests during check in. Neither of my requests were made. We were right next to the elevator and could hear people coming and going through out the night. Regarding the crib, I at first thought maybe they were all out, but I saw a bunch in their storage area so I think they just forgot. Room also did not have a tub, we made do and bathed our son sitting up in the handicap chair. Room was adequate and clean- 2 full size beds, flat screen tv, fridge, safe. Fridge settings did not work, we couldn’t make it colder. Big patio that faced Alohilani hotel and their beautiful infinity pool. Hotel is surrounded by other high rise hotels so I don’t imagine you’ll get much of a view unless you’re at the very top. My biggest gripe about the room- no fan in bathroom, I could see mold growing in various places. There is also a large vent right above you, that I couldn’t help but stare at every time I brushed my teeth, hoping no bugs would come out of it. AC worked fine for us, kept our room cool. Didn’t check out their restaurants but they give you discount coupons for them. Parking was easy. $28 + tax daily. There are 2 lots- one indoor, one outdoor. I can’t recall the exact amount of the resort fee- maybe $21+ tax? Both parking and resort fees combined for a 6 night stay cost us an additional $300. My advice- look into renting a condo if you’re renting a car. Or skip the car rental and just get it for a few days during your stay. You don’t need a car in Waikiki but we like to drive around the island. Location was great and the only reason I’d come back here again, if the price was right.

The greeting staff were very helpful. We had booked a suite for this 6 day stay. It was very roomy and nicely decorated. The living room and bedroom each had balconies with views of Waikiki Beach. Two of the best things about the hotel are the housekeeping staff and the generous yet economical breakfast buffet off the hotel lobby. While eating, we could see beach goers at Waikiki Beach. Slightly disappointing was the pool area, which could use some attention. The parking garage is relatively small for a hotel of it's size.

Fantastic Location close to quieter Waikiki beaches, shopping, main streets with public trans, and most touristy shuttle pickups. Hotel provides beach towels. Interesting convenience store in lobby with many unconventional, asian medicines. There is a pool and a spa parlor. Rooms have small coffee machine, safe, and tiny fridge. Rooms are clean and well tended. Comfortable beds. Lobby cafe is good for value buffet breakfast, but so many great breakfast options nearby.Cons. Don't try to leave before 9am, the elevators and lobby are swamped with Korean Air flight staff and massive tour groups trying to catch all of their shuttles and buses. Spa website has expired so no info unless you walk up. Korean restaurant in-house is overpriced. Wifi is located ""in various rooms on each floor so just connect to the nearest one""; doesn't allow you to connect most of the time since there is no password (meaning too many people probably using the free wifi so don't count on it). Bathroom is tiny and ""tub"" is practically nonexistent (approx 3' wide, 4' long, and 1.5' deep), you might be able to bathe your feet or a small dog in there. No true closet, just a hanging rack in the tiny bathroom area. When the wind picks up, the sliding door to balcony rattles quite a bit.

We (my 16 year old daughter and me) looked for a budget hotel in a good location. To that extent the WRH was fine. However the room didn't smell clean, almost like some old ciggie smoked up bedspreads, not sure - it was just a bit wrong. The room didn't have a view, it looked out onto some sort of concrete pad where something was being built or pulled down - 5 years ago. We could see another hotels pool, that was comforting. We didn't have breakfast included but also didn't buy breakfast there. Given the total lack of decent coffee anywhere (and a try hard coffee costs USD $6.50) we probably should have gone the breakfast and coffee. The room was just OK, the location is very convenient. ABC (like 7/11) store almost next door for quick but expensive snacks and beer. The guy who checked us in was a bit arrogant without need to be and that set the tone of the stay.Car parking is extra $25 USD / day and when you get your bill at the end there is an $ 18 USD / day environmental levy or some levy I wasn't told about.No milk in the room, some coffee and tea and a bag of something which looked like nuts.

However, I feel that I must give an honest review with the exceptional service and value that the Waikiki Resort Hotel gives. First and foremost is the location. It's only a block off the beach, and about mid-strip with the 1 min walk to Kalakaua Ave. This puts everything in Waikiki in walking distance. Second, I love that they have self parking. I mean I love Waikiki and all, but I spend a lot of time coming back and forth to different parts of the island. And honestly, valet parking is a hassle when you are in and out of the car. I have stayed here three times when visiting Oahu, and been treated with nothing but aloha every time. The staff is great, the location is AWESOME, and I love the amenities.

Very small, almost unusable basin/vanity in the bathroom. Great intimate bar on lobby floor, with excellent happy hour (6 - 9pm). Korean restaurant was one of the best for food. Great authentic Korean dishes but the atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired. We played music from our iphone to get the mood going. Seems the sound system was broken in the restaurant. But dont let that stop you from enjoying the wonderful Korean food. Comfortable room with a good size balcony, microwave, jug, sink etc. Our room backed onto the lifts which were very noisy.

Checkin - Is normally at 3pm. We arrived at 11am and asked if we could get our room quicker as we were really tired after a long flight. We were told it would be prioritised. We went for out until 1.30pm, room still not ready. Checked again at 2pm to be told that there was a computer glitch and nobody could be checked in. At 2.30pm we were checked in but they couldn't validate any credit cards so were we had to leave our card with them. We went down about 30 minutes later our card was given back.Room - Ocean view room on the 16th floor. Reasonably good view given that the hotel is one block back from the beach. Bathroom is a bit dated and could do with a bit of TLC. The room was clean, comfortable, housekeeping was great, king size bed was quite comfortable and there was an armchair with a footstool plus a desk and chair. Also a Keurig coffee machine - not the best if you are a tea drinker. Good amount of tv channels, wifi was free and pretty good speed (had to connect to other room's wifi though and sometimes got a message saying it was unsecured so I just switched which room I was connected to).Sleep Quality - We were right by the lift which didn't seem to be noisy, but there was a reasonably constant background noise which affected our sleep. Not sure what caused it - the airconditioner? the lift? the wind outside? Sirens from emergency vehicles are easily heard from the 16th floor and some mornings I could hear the trucks loading/unloading/reversing.Location - great location one block back from the beach, 2 minute walk to the beach, a short walk to Duke's Statue to catch the trolleys and cafes/restaurants, the Zoo is close by.Tour desk - We booked 3 tours through the desk which is run by Expedia. Good service but I think we could have got better deals elsewhere.Pool - Very basic on the second floor, was clean and a good temperature. Pool towels are available in the basement and can be taken to the beach.Laundry - Coin operated washing machines and dryers are in the basement/car park. Cost is $2 per load and change is available from reception. Machines did not wash clothes very well.Eating - Cafe for breakfast and lunch and a restaurant for more formal dinners. Also a food truck in the car park, which does quite nice food. We didn't eat at the hotel.They handled the hurricane threat well & kept us informed.

Tip: When they say that you can hear the elevators (mini suite next to elevator) they mean it. It makes a howling sound (like a strong wind). At first I was a little put off however it really did just sound like wind and was very quickly drowned out. I was never woken up by it and found it easy to go to sleep.

Every single time I bring my family/friends along, it always ends up being a memorable and eventful time with not one single dull moment for everyone to remember. I had booked a weekend at the Resort and my reservation was obscured in the process and was booked a day before my actual arrival. I arrived on the date not knowing that I did not have a room available for me since the reservation accidentally got pushed back a day. The staff jumped to the situation and helped resolved the problem and was able to rebook me a new room with no charge at all. I must say the short time it took to re-book a room for me was quickly completed within the time it took my family and I to have brunch.The hotel is in an unbeatable area, you are welcome to the pool on the 2nd Floor or take less than 5 minutes to Waikiki Beach to take a dip in the pacific! The location is quite central from a large variety of shopping, restaurants and bars! All of Kalakaua Ave is available to all of your endeavors from shopping at Hawai'i's tiny mom and pop souvenir shops to browsing some of the finest shops in Waikiki! The hotel itself is a wonderful place to stay and the staff really make sure our visits there feel at right at home! Their hospitality make staying there such a welcoming environment for all of their guests to enjoy. Quick to respond to room service requests, very accommodating to many different situations and customer service is just always A+. The cleanliness of the room always exceeds proficiency, the room never has that odd, stale odor that some hotels possess. A great thing about this hotel is it offers many different comfortable and inviting rooms at different affordable rates with the same customer service as a luxury room would. The hotel ranges from many different affordable room rates, featuring their very own array of Waikiki Resort toiletries! These rooms do include In-Room and Lobby high speed internet, as well as a dvd kiosk to borrow at your liking for the entertainment system, we used that to our advantage quite often. The children that travel with us definitely appreciated it when they travel with us. A thousand Mahalo's and Aloha's to the GM Glenn Vergara and family favorite, Brandon, for always creating an ambience filled with Good Vibrations, Aloha Spirit. Glenn has a way of maintaining an all around inviting and captivating experience.","Wahiawa, Hawaii","cabertocaesar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wahiawa, Hawaii</strong>",0,5.0

We saw 2 to 3 groups of Koreans checked-in, we saw 2 groups of flight crew checked-in. We saw a small Asian family checked-in. By then it was 2:30pm, we again went to the counter and spoke to a man, Connor. After confronting him, he gave us a key which was already ready to our room. The next day, we were so tired, we left our room a little later, we saw the house-keeping lady outside our room and told her we were from Rm 509, she then said ""Do you need service everyday?""

We arrived late at night & very tired, to find the guy on Reception very helpful. But no-one to help with our luggage and the trolleys all locked up so we couldn't use them. Finally he found someone out the back who helped us with the luggage. The hotel room was large but decor quite dated and the air cond not on when we arrived so we were hot AND tired. However, the bed was very comfortable I have to say. There was a coffee machine but no milk, and only paper cups with a plastic straw to stir, which I felt very poor quality.The bathroom must have been divided up at one stage as there was a large wardrobe area with a safe, washbasin and the fridge (with no cold water or glasses)!! Then the toilet and shower area. The toilet was very low (I have mobility issues) and the step-over shower recess had no hand-rail or anything for safety. The towels were thick and fluffy and the amenities changed daily.What I found odd was that there was no bar in the hotel, & the restaurant was only open for breakfast and lunch and no room service!! There was also a Korean restaurant but that was ""it"". If you wanted anything to eat you had to go outside down the road (not far though)The breakfast was ""OK"" but no choice in eggs (usual scrambled), there was an assortment of hot dishes and Asian dishes plus fruits & salad (???); the coffee very ordinary (and there was plastic sachets of milk on the table). I asked for cream and was told they didn't have any. We had to take some sachets of milk for our in-room coffee machine.They need to add in extra glasses in the room (only 2 small glasses kept in the bathroom); some cold water in the fridge and proper cups with milk left.We would stay again simply for the location and comfy bed but be aware all hotels in Hawaii have added daily taxes plus plus so it was NOT a cheap option really (and car parking another extra if you needed it).

Upon arrival I was informed that there had been an issue with my room and that I was unable to check-in at the time. I had just arrived from mainland US and it was about 11pm. The staff were very apologetic and I was gifted two vouchers for the breakfast buffet. I was also given a room in the hotel next door. So the inconvenience was minimal. The staff did a great job facilitating my check-in of the new hotel and offered their assistance with anything I needed.Upon checking into my the following day, I found the room to be spacious and open with a view of Waikiki Beach. I had booked a corner suite. The room had a king size bed, fold out lounge and kitchenette. The bathroom was old and in need of renovations, everything was outdated. The lighting was poor and there was no curtain on the bathroom window. I was on the 9th floor and it was pretty quiet, the major noise I noticed was from other rooms on my floor, this could not be helped and it didn't bother me. When I checked in I was advised to try and attend the breakfast buffet around 9:30am as this is when most of the guests had already eaten and it would be quieter. As I had a lunchtime flight on the day I left I went to the buffet from breakfast around 7:30am, expecting it to busy. It was, however what was disappointing was that fact there were empty tables for the people waiting, just not enough staff to clear the tables and seat people. If the hotel knows it will be busy why not have extra staff assigned to the dining room. This would have made a 40min wait around 20mins. While this did not have a major impact on me as I was expecting it, it is easily solvable by the hotel.The pool was not much, very simple but the Hotel is a very short walk to the beach and in my opinion one of the better places to stay off the beach in Waikiki. It was value for money and the staff were very friendly. There is a coin laundry downstairs for hotel guest use also. My room also had multiple USB chargers which came in handy.All in all a nice place to stay.","Newcastle, Australia","JohnKoot1981</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle, Australia</strong>",19,4.0

It's included if you book directly with the hotel.Despite several requests for a room on the upper floors, including at the time of booking (numerous months in advance), we were given a room in the lower half of the building. When I book a seat on an airline, I have the opportunity to choose my seat at the time of booking. Obviously, the earlier I book, the better choice of seats I have. I can't wait until hotels start doing the same thing - allowing me to choose the room I want to stay in at the time of booking. As it stands now, it doesn't matter how early you book, you are at the mercy of check-in staff as to which room you are allocated, regardless of how early you book.Overall, this is a reasonable place to stay.

We enjoyed all of our meals for breakfast and lunch that we had at the lobby restaurant(Llima). There wasn't a huge selection but it was adequate and reasonably priced and using the 20% off coupon the hotel gives their guests is a bonus. If they had been open for supper we would have used that option as well because of the prices and convenience. Having never been to Waikiki before we found the restaurant prices and just about everything else very expensive compared to home. Also being there over Christmas made it hard to find a place to eat in Waikiki at night that didn't require a half hour wait or more. The only thing we didn't like is the constant street noise in the room day and night and screaming guests using the pool at the hotel across the street. We are used to double pane windows at home so I imagine most of the problem is from the single pane glass door and window. There is also a metal panel on the other side of the street that bangs twice every time a vehicle goes over it and echoes up into the rooms. From our balcony we could see diamond head through two buildings and could also see the beach area looking down the street. The hotel is set in among other buildings so I wouldn't say there is a true ocean front view. We had a king bed on the 11th floor and was very happy with the size of the room and bathroom. Would have given it an excellent if it hadn't been for the street noise that affected our sleep-never thought of taking ear plugs as we also found this an issue at the hotel we stayed at before our cruise in Waikiki.

We had stayed at another hotel on the way over and called in here to enquire about airport transfers and a few other things. I found the staff to be very helpful even though I had to arrange my own transfer. The room that I booked was a city view but I did have a glimpse of the ocean. There was construction going on next door but to be honest it didn't have any impact on my stay at all. The hotel is 1 block from the beach to it's not too far to walk. The room that I stayed in was 1611. First of all I must say the bed was one of the most comfortable I had slept in, much appreciated. The room had plenty of storage which I didn't make use of as I couldn't be bothered to unpack for a 2 night stay. Yes the fridge is small but it works and all I had to put in there was water and milk. There is a safe in the room, it's on a shelf in the bathroom. For me being quite short I had to get someone else to get something out of the back of the safe as I couldn't reach the object that was the only issue I had. The bathroom was clean with the bath/shower and toilet separated by a door from the wash basin which is quite a good idea.Check out was quick with no issues.

We had just spent a week on Kauai so were only in Waikiki for one night which would be spent dining and shopping so booked purely on price.The room was a little dated (but which ones aren't in Waikiki...) although clean and tidy. Bathroom could do with a bit of an upgrade with new vanity tops etc but overall a nice room for an overnight. A little on the small side, and we booked a city view room which was exactly that, but for people who complain about the view of other buildings there are always oceanfront hotels to be stayed in for 2-3 times the price.Booked online and received breakfast included in the price which was a decent typical American breakfast selection.Front desk guys were very helpful and polite though possibly a little too casual for some people in terms of chatting amongst themselves, but I've been in the industry and if it breaks up the boredom of a long shift and complaining guests, go for it.literally a 30 second walk from hotel to beach with good shopping and restaurants within strolling distance.Would I stay here again, definitely, as I probably wouldn't be inclined to stay in Waikiki for more than a couple of nights tops.

At the last minute, my gut told me to select Waikiki Resort Hotel, and I am glad I did. I had called reservations after I confirmed to request a special room. My wife has been going through recent challenges, and I wanted her to have a great experience, it being her first time in Oahu. They told me they would work to honor the request, but couldn't gaurantee. Understood. It was just a request.Lo and behold, when we checked in, they were able to accommodate my request! David was fantastic. He checked us in, was not only efficient, but worked to build a relationship. He was not only a great ambassador for the hotel, but for Hawaii in general. He also recommended two great places to eat and made adjustments to our reservation seamlessly, as we were able to extend our stay for a day. We didn't have to change our room, and got a better value than we would have changing hotels. He is a true hospitality professional.The hotel is in a great location, central to all things by the beach and is accessible to everything you'd want to do within a short walking distance. This hotel, in essence, is a renovated motel, but the service is well worth it when you combine the price. It is a great, great value.It would have received 5 stars but the concierge was a touch rude (supposedly set up a dinner reservation for us that was non-existent when we arrived. It was suspicious mainly because she unnecessarily cautioned us about not honoring the reservation we requested) and the young lady running breakfast was very efficient, but not super friendly (side note...if you have breakfast vouchers, tell her ahead of time or you will get scolded). These small instances were not enough derail our positive feelings regarding the hotel, David, and the team. I am a 15 year veteran of the hospitality field and was a corporate trainer for luxury hotels. I currently run my own hospitality and service consulting firm. Genuine hospitality is not easy to come by, and I am pretty adept and knowing the difference. You will find it here at Waikiki Resort Hotel. They care whether you really are enjoying your experience.

I booked via a travel site where you are given a ""discount"" (that maybe everyone gets!)Even though the hotel must have been one of the first high-rise hotels around Waikiki, maybe in the 60s or 70s, there is a friendly atmosphere, and the staff go out of their way to make your stay pleasant. My flight from Japan came in early, and staff managed to get me the room before ordinary check-in.The building has some mid 20th century charm, but everything is well maintained, and there are the contemporary electronics and an OK wifi set up. Basically, everything you need for staying short term. The location is great; however, you should know that later developments built up around the hotel, which obstruct what must have outstanding views at one time. (I didn't mind, since I don't stay in a place to be sitting all the time in a hotel room.) I know a downstairs restaurant is sometimes important, but the one available was a little too crowded for me with tourists who seemed to be on a package. Also, Waikiki, like many southern Japanese cities, are magnets for Far East Asian tourists, and sometimes I feel there can be cultural misunderstandings when they are staying with someone who is not also on whatever group they are with.Location is really good, it's just one block north of the main avenue, and three beaches are within close walking distance. There is also a supermarket about 8 minutes away on foot, if you are gluten-free or don't eat restaurant food.Sequels are never quite the original, but I would definitely stay at Waikiki Resort, just for the great service and atmosphere.(P.S. the hotel across the way had some construction going on, which may be noticeable depending on what side of the hotel you are on.

Always welcoming and friendly staff. If you're looking for a reasonably priced stay in a prime location just a block black from the boulevard this is ideal. I like the retro feel of the hotel decor - some may call it dated but I think it adds character. Room was always clean and when I asked to be moved room as we were in a twin Scott at the front desk was very accommodating and sorted it out straight away. I wouldn't pay extra for an ocean view as the hotel is dwarfed by larger structures on every side. Beds are great and rooms have all major amenities. Our room this time didn't have a bath but some of them do. Worth noting if this is important to you. Liked the addition of the DVD rental. Perfect if it's raining! All brand new releases. Nice touch. There's a convenience store in the hotel with everything you need and of course an ABC store in every corner. We've never dined at the restaurant but there's so much more in close vicinity you don't need the hotel to provide you with this. Some investment could be made at the pool area. It's always been empty every time we've stayed. Yes the ocean is just a stones throw away but it would be great to have a place to grab a cocktail in the veranda. The general area looks quite run down. Even something as simple as upgrading the sun loungers would make a big difference so as it's not wasted space. Not a big issue for us though - just an idea!We are repeat visitors so it would be nice if breakfast was offered as an incentive to book again. Buffet on offer was a perfect mix of Asian and Western cuisine. I think this hotel is owned by Korean airlines so you'll see lots of their staff staying. Would book again. Always a pleasant stay and location is a winner. Also worthwhile to note that MacDonalds is right on the block in front - Waikiki is expensive so it's nice to be able to pop in before a bus trip for something reasonably priced. ,,vonni_m43,17,4.0

One only has to walk out the front entrance and two or three minutes later you will hit the beach!Stayed for two weeks with family.From this end of the Waikiki beach strip you have to swim out a bit before you see the beautiful Diamond Head. Alternatively, it's about five or ten minutes walk along the beach (towards the Royal Hawaiian Hotel) before you can see Diamond Head from the shore. At this end there were some cute schools of fishes in ankle-deep to waist-deep water (I saw about four different kinds). No waves at this end, so good for the kiddies, oldies, or just the super relaxed. The less good: there's not a lot of restaurant variety in close proximity, other than Eggs N Things, McDonalds, Burger King and takeaway places. It was difficult to find half-way healthy food without having to walk at least twenty minutes or more along the main strip. However, the Korean restaurant at the hotel was great. Hotel breakfast buffet was pretty standard - no complaints. Overall we were happy with our city view floor on level 17. Alas, at this stage of my life I cannot yet afford an ocean view hotel in Hawai'i. Next time!! Special mention to the Filipino maintenance man (I wish I could remember his name). He was super friendly and hospitable (he helped us with setting up internet and fixed a faulty light). He would always greet us kindly - his bubbly personality is an asset to the hotel. P.s. Wifi was generally fine. We were instructed to use the wifi from neighbouring rooms because ours ""didn't have a modem"".

When we saw just how close we were to the beach - one SMALL block - and how impressive all the staff were, we vowed that this is where we will stay on any future trips. The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. Contrary to what others have said, we didn't find the rooms small at all - very comfortable. Not flashy but we weren't paying for that either. Not one staff member from the maintenance staff to the retail staff in the downstairs store failed to greet us with a smile and they went above and beyond in their customer service.

We stayed on the 10th floor, didn’t have a view of the sea but we were happy with the view we had. We had a roll out bed in our room which was surprisingly quite comfy. Amenities DVD rental is great; they have a good variety really handy for those lazy days.Towel rental is really good and convenient. Swimming pool is small, but as we are so close to the beach not maybe people used it so we found it to be quiet most of the time. WIFI, no issues in the room or hotel lobby was able to facetime friends and family in England with no problems. Only downfall is that WIFI is not available by the swimming pool. Fridge, Safe, Iron, Kettle- usual stuff in the room, all very convenient and worked well. Breakfast:We tried this out twice it was ok, I personally don’t think it is worth the price. Maybe a little more fruit and variety of cereals. As hotel guests you get a 20% discount, but as it is attached to the hotel it is a convenient. Didn’t try the other hotel restaurant. Staff:Front desk, maintenance and especially housekeeping were all very helpful, friendly and work really hard. Location:Fabulous, Waikiki beach is a few minutes away literally half a short block. Hotel is based in a popular tourist area and there are lots of the usual shops/restaurants around. Activities: We didn’t book anything through the hotel so I can’t comment on their concierge service. We booked either directly with activity provider or used one of the reps on the beach front. Luah- Paradise Cove was amazing, entertainment, food, activities all were greatWater activities: we did Jet skiing and parasailing with H20 sports, staff were great and made the day enjoyable. Island Tour- nice way to see lots of things Big Island-helicopter tour- unfortunately the helicopter part of the tour was cancelled due to weather conditions but going over to the big Island was a great experience. Hanauma bay- is a must see Getting around:We didn’t hire a car and opted for public transport which was both reasonably priced and very convenient. Local bus stop is half block away serves many useful bus routes. Overall View: We had a very enjoyable 2 week stay at Waikiki Resort and I would defiantly recommend it to others.","Wembley, United Kingdom","806nicky_star</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wembley, United Kingdom</strong>",14,5.0

I was given a room upgrade where I just had to add over $100.00 something. And it was the Penthouse with 2 rooms and a living room! I was elated and thankful for the accommodation.My only complaint is the Shuttle that took us back to the airport the next day was not very nice. He drove us to the airport with a few other people. This was on the 26th of August. And I was with my grandbaby who is 5 years old. We have 3 big suitcases and few carry ons. And I take the wheelchair because of my knees. The driver dropped us off in between Delta and United. There is a walk to the check in area. The driver said because there were cars at the drop off area. He could have waited a minute to see but he did not. I had to beg people to watch over my luggages while I had to find someone to pick my luggages. This had caused me to get aggravated. All the nice experience I had with Hawaii just disappeared. The driver should have been more helpful. He wasn't.I would like for this driver to know he made our stay very unpleasant.

However, the rooms are another story. I looked at several hotels in the same price range as the room I chose and I can honestly say that I don't think the price I paid represented what I should have seen in the room. The room was clean and comfortable as you would expect, but despite the ""ocean view"" I paid extra for - the room is anything to be desired. You are cramped in like sardines on two double-beds and there is very little room to spare besides the bed and a small desk and dresser. With the price I paid I would have expected some other piece of furniture to sit on besides the desk chair. The maid kept the place looking nice and the beds were comfortable yet tight for two average size adults. You have to be very mindful of all the hidden fees of this hotel. There is a $10/day amenities fee that covers phones, internet, etc. which is about average for this type of fee - however I meant to mention there is a catch with the amenities. You cannot use the ""Business center"" which has two computers for that included fee. You must use a credit card to use the Business Center computers. The more frustrating charge that although disclosed on expedia's website is a total joke - in reference to Customer Hotel Parking fee. Parking in general in this hotel's general geographic area is very tight. They offer ""hotel"" parking for you as a guest for the ridiculous price of $25/day. What is ironic that for a hotel with 19 floors, there are only 30-40 total space available next to the hotel and underneath the hotel (in total). If you happen to be out late - you can forget getting a chance to park there. Also they have a weird ticketing system for this parking that is problematic from time to time. You must use the ticket to both enter and leave the parking areas. For those of you who don't rent a car the hotel does happen to be within walking distance of both the beach and several other shops and restaurants. So if you do not have a car have no fear. I would also comment in general that if you are used to to big city streets this town will be no surprise to you, however coming from a smaller town i was overwhelmed with the number of one way streets, buses, and people traffic in general. You can take any estimate on Google Maps and about double it if you are going to travel anywhere by car inside of Waikiki Beach.","Monroe, Michigan","Michael G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Monroe, Michigan</strong>",0,3.0

The staff were just amazing, managing to arrange for the rooms to be next to each other. The hotel was full so they really worked hard to ensure our holiday went smoothly. We had a bottle of wine and some lovely confectionery in our room on arrival as I had mentioned on the booking that it was my birthday and our anniversary. A really lovely touch. We were on the 18th floor and we had the end room which was lightly larger than my mother's. The rooms are spacious and the view from the balcony, just wonderful. We had breakfast included and this was a buffet. There was an excellent selection but if there was something from the menu you would rather (can't see why you would though) the staff were more than happy to oblige. After such a wonderful breakfast, we didn't want anything until much later. Big saving on the food budget!! The hotel is just one block from the sea and the main walkway. There are numerous high class shops and plenty of places to eat but mainly the best places are in the hotels. We did not eat at the hotel in the evenings and there is no bar in the hotel.

The horrible part was the extra $90/night to get a room with a view. A bit steep for a room upgrade. The room was nice, the refrigerator, coffee pot, small kitchen sink (no dishes or silverware) and coffee cups wonderful. As always, there's an enormous tv screen across from the bed - like you're going to spend your days in paradise watching tv. The pool was nice but it was annoying to have to get a pool towel in the basement and then have to return the towel there instead of leaving it for housekeeping. Don't eat the scrambled eggs at the breakfast buffet- they taste like whatever shortening they use to keep them from sticking has diesel fuel in it. There is a nice selection of breads for toasting and the toaster works well. Maid service didn't check the balcony so if you're staying for a few days you are in charge of tidying that area up. Very friendly reception desk staff - a huge plus! And the $12 shuttle to the airport is wonderful. Tip the bell desk guy and he'll put your luggage on the shuttle for you. But, I asked him to let me know when the PCC van arrived and he dropped the ball on that. That was the truly outstanding day of my vacation- book a trip to the Polynesian Cultural Center and they pick you up and drop you off at your hotel.

Lanai had decent space, regrettably no ocean view but the city view on the 16th floor was not too bad. Rainbows looked great. :)Couple of issues though...location of fridge on floor, under sink in bathroom area is not ideal. One, as it is the bathroom area, upon our arrival, the fridge had several long hairs inside of it, which was kind of gross. Then the amount of bending required to put things in and take them out was annoying. You could not see into the fridge properly without getting on the floor. Elevating the fridge and relocating it out of the bathroom area would be fantastic. The addition of a microwave to the room would be great too (hint,hint)Full disclosure, there was a roach sighting in our bathroom and in one of our friend's rooms which lead to intense scrutiny of our luggage and clothes in an effort to make sure nothing followed us home. Yes, it is the tropics and bugs are to be expected but no one ""wants"" to see them.Thankfully, there was only the one we each saw, so as to not be creeped out completely.Hotel was perfectly situated for everything we wanted to do in Waikiki which was great. Even walking distance to the car rental office. Very close to the beach with a nice protected area for kids to swim in.Front desk staff was very helpful in sorting out who was smoking (in a non smoking hotel) so that we could breathe in our room as well as helping with our Buffet ticket issue for our child.The Daily buffet breakfast that was included was in the restaurant in the lobby and was good.

I hate to give bad reviews but there was just a few too many things that went wrong on this visit to give a positive review. Firstly we asked if we could book in as early as possible as we had been on a long flight, well when we returned to the hotel at 2pm we were told the room was ready 'ages ago' but no one called us as my mobile number was an Australian number?? I can't believe the staff have not called an international number in the past.The room was nice enough but there was no sheers on the balcony doors so we couldn't have the curtains pushed back and the door open at all as all the neighbouring buildings has a clear view into the room. The room was just a standard room, I accept that, but all we had was a view to a small back road with apartment buildings. I would never pay extra to have a partial ocean view room let alone an ocean view room, I just don't believe this hotel would have any rooms with such views. Apart from no sheer curtains on the balcony doors I did see a couple of baby cochroaches in the room, there was no other mirror in the room apart from the bathroom which made it difficult for 2 people to get ready if someone was using the sink or hairdryer and someone just needed a mirror and the toilet blocked up completely on the second day. House keeping was a bit hit and miss, it seems it depended on who cleaned your room on a certain day as to wether or not all tasks were done...The pool was on a deck on the 2nd floor and although there was no view (which is often the case in Waikiki hotels) it was a very nice pool, clean with lovely outdoor lounges around. The hotel has a small convenience store in the lobby which was handy but the Japanese (?) woman running it needs to take some 'friendly' lessons, I don't think I got one word out of her during my several visits in there. On the plus side the hotel is in a wonderful location. There are nice places to eat nearby, 2 small blcoks to Kuhio Ave where the buses run and 2 small blocks to the front street and the beach 'lagoon'.The one shining light in the property is a wonderful man called Leo at the 'bell desk'. He was delightful, funny, helpful -going out of his way to find out some information about a transfer to a local tourist destination. He worked hard and always had a smile on his face. Not surprising he used to work at the Mirimar!

The Waikiki Resort turned out to be a great value for us based on location, amenities, and cost. Before booking, know that they tack on a mandatory $10 per day concierge fee at the end of your stay to cover use of beach towels, DVD movie use via a Red Box-like vending machine, and in house restaurant discount. The room bathroom is small and the bathroom light illuminates the whole room, not just the bathroom. The lanai is cool, if you're a smoker, but not so cool if you're not due to smokers on other room's lanai. The in room complimentary wifi was fast enough and didn't drop us once. The buffet breakfast was very good, fast, convenient, and reasonable versus other choices in Waikiki. Elevators were fast, which made the ice machine on the second floor seem not quite so far away. The tiny in room refrigerator froze everything we put in it overnight regardless of where we set the dial. No microwave. We saw mostly Korean patrons here versus seeing mostly Japanese everywhere else.Don't miss the free activities: shows at the Duke Kuhanamoku Statue, beach volley ball tourneys, surfing, etc, right at the beach. We were able to walk to the zoo and aquarium. We took a shuttle to hike Diamond Head, but walked (quite a ways) back to the hotel from there. The Ala Moana shopping center and Beach Park is about the same distance in the other direction, and I suggest paying the $2 each way for the trolley. It's $2.50 and over an hour one way on the city bus to Pearl Harbor, and $22 rt (+$7.50 entrance fee) to Hanauma Bay including snorkel gear. Alas, we didn't find much good local cuisine in Waikiki. Burgers in Paradise (next door) was an exception. Rainbow Drive Inn is a little far to walk, but very popular with locals. There is always a crowd and a line-up for food at Murakame Udon (noodles.) Otherwise, after a few mundane and overpriced meals at local venues, we took solace at Subway and KFC.So, get ready for a busy, fun vacation complete with beautiful sunny weather, awesome sights and sunsets, beach, shopping, and luaus, in a big, expensive resort town full of crowds, traffic, and foreign tourists.",,RadRasmussen .,7,4.0

There was no one there to help us with our bags. Although I am more than capable of carrying my own bags it would of been nice for at least a staff member to batter their eyelids and offered a helping hand or a greeting.While checking in (there was 4 of us, 2 couples, 2 separate rooms) the staff member gave us keys to a different room as to what he had checked us in on the system. This resulted in our account getting charged for parking.Hotel room is nice but the bathrooms can use a facelift. It is TINY. How tiny is it? It is so tiny that in order for you to take a shower or go to the bathroom you must first open the door, step inside the room, lean against the wall while holding your breath as you close the door! My husband who is 183cm tall struggled with the shower and found it beyond a joke that such small confined bathrooms like this still exists. Even NYC or Japan bathrooms were bigger! Walls are thin which means you can hear everythingAir con is exceptionally loud but if you put it down low then you can't feel anything. If you put it up then you can't sleep due to the noise. When we brought all of these issues up to the staff member they said there is nothing else available except for one other room which was a downgrade to what we had paid for. I found this very hard to believe as our friend had the same issues and later on was upgraded to a better room. Maybe we were not assertive enough? When checking out we got charged with the extra resort fees however, when our friends checked out they were told not to worry about paying for the resort fee. To charge 1 customer resort fees and choose not to charge another within 5 mins of each customer checking out is unjust and I will never be coming back here nor will I be recommending this hotel.

Parking is $15/day, resort fee is $10/day to cover amenities most hotels have standard.

The area is tough for parking, just about everywhere is on street but it's tough to find. So naturally something in short commodity will come at a price.  One feature i did like at the hotel was the free dvd rental in the lobby. That was a nice touch. Bathroom was on the smaller side, and could use an update. AC was consistent. Wifi had trouble connecting the first night but once you alter your security settings it can be fixed. The hotel has a partnership of some sort with Korean Air since that airline had a desk in the lobby. Rooms weren't terribly remarkable but were comfortable for our liking.

And huge hotels surround it, but we did manage to get a view of the ocean.. so my guess is some of the higher rooms also have a view. But I think it def depends on where you are located.

Top of the positive list is the location it is perfect, a very short walk to the beach, shops and restaurants. My second positive is the hotel staff, I had read in a previous review that there were no full length mirrors in the rooms and to my dismay, there was none in our room, We only had one medium sized mirror in the bathroom which is not great for 2 ladies trying to put on make up etc. I went to the reception to ask if there were any full length mirrors we could have and was told that they had none, I expressed my disappointment and went out for the day. On our return to the hotel low and behold a full length mirror appeared, apparently the receptionist a very nice lady called Nancy had organised someone to buy one and fix it in our room. Nancy I applaud you as you went the extra mile to make sure our holiday was perfect and I hope this review gets back to her. The breakfasts in the morning were reasonable with the 20% discount you get and it an all you can eat buffet, which isn't bad. I agree with some of the other reviews that the rooms could be updated and they charge nearly 10$ a day for wi fi in your room, which is expensive, you can get it free in the lobby but that can be inconvenient.

The second, well......our first experience at the hotel wasn't great. Before we left we had emailed the hotel requesting early check in (yes we understood it was a request only), a high floor and telling them that we were coming to celebrate my birthday. We arrived at 8 and was told that in a kurt way that check in was at 3 and to check back at 2. I explained that we had requested early check in and was told the same thing, after a long flight all we wanted was a shower and to rest for an hour - the kids were exhausted. So we accepted the rudeness, and sat in the lobby. Then we saw other guests being served by a different person, who were also told the same thing, but in a much nicer way and they were having their registration forms done - we weren't offered that. I then went back about 1130 and asked if there had been any change, by this stage another staff member was there and the original staff member was now being very nice to me - wishing me a happy birthday doing my registration and said my room was being cleaned as we spoke. Our room was fine, it had 2 double beds, and a small balcony. The bathroom was small and adequate. Then we discovered a couple of small things that that cleaners had missed but that was enough for me to ask to change rooms. This is when our holiday got much better, I met Branden - he is the most amazing and kind person I have ever met. I explained what had happened to me this morning and the concerns I had with our room. He listened and then went and saw the manager to see how they could make our stay more enjoyable. They upgraded us to Penthouse A, which was incredible. We were more than happy - and very grateful. We then received champagne and those yummy Hawaiian biscuits as a birthday gift - once again so appreciative. Branden continued to check on us during our stay, to make sure everything is ok. He is a great ambassador for this hotel - he turned our average start to the best holiday ever. I have to mention the beds were the most comfortable hotel beds that I have ever stayed in, and we travel a lot!! If you are looking for a hotel that is close to the beach and not overly priced this is the hotel for you - would I stay here again - absolutely. Thanks Waikiki Resort for a great holiday.","Brisbane, Queensland, Australia","Kellbelle276</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Queensland, Australia</strong>",5,4.0

Unfortunately, I ate my words as soon as we got there! At first sight, you can tell that the hotel is older and in much need of a renovation. We pulled up and immediately noticed that the hotel did not have valet parking! In fact, there are 2 self-parking places to choose from (basement or outdoor in the lot). Parking is scarce and $25 a night. When my husband and I would return late at night, we would be lucky to find any parking in their tight spaces. In addition, I didn't think the service there was anything special. I actually found their service rather slow and was hesitant to ask the front desk of any questions in fear that I would have to stand there for too long just to get an answer.The hotel itself doesn't have much to offer. The pool is tiny and was always packed whenever we checked it out. There's a convenience store downstairs next to another small vitamin (I think it was a vitamin shop) store, bar, and restaurant. In addition, the rooms are pretty small with an even smaller bathroom! If you have a fear of tight spaces, I wouldn't recommend this hotel for you.The only positive aspect to this hotel is its location...other than its price in comparison to nearby hotels! It's a few minutes away from Waikiki Beach and is within walking distance of Waikiki's main attractions. If you're willing to sacrifice luxury and decency, then this place is definitely for you.

What it lacked in sophistication, it made up for in space. I loved the large 3 bay room layout...a kitchenette and dining table, a living room, and a separate bedroom and bathroom. The view from the large balcony that spanned the length of the entire suite was pretty good too...Facing West towards Waikiki. There was a small view of the ocean over the parking garage across the street. I didn't care for the quality of the toiletries..the soaps and shampoos didn't lather, and the smell of the body lotion was a bit foul (so you might want to bring your own). The location of the hotel is great...one short block from the beach and tonnes of shopping and restaurant options. The pool was ok...clean and not used often. Probably because it is very small and basic. Overall it was a decent stay. Staff were very friendly. The lobby was a little crowded at times but it is crowded almost everywhere in Waikiki.

The room was adequate although I stress this that the hotel is the nosiest I have ever stayed in. You hear everything, including the elevator and we weren't all that close to it, anyone in the hallways and every door closing. I had a few awful nights sleep and was woken up early everyday.Breakfast is advertised to be served until 10:30 am in the elevator although my husband and I arrived before 10 am and they were packing everything away and we were told we would have to get only what was left and could only go up once to the buffet as they were packing it up. WiFi at the hotel is good in your room but you have to pay extra for it.On that note you have to pay extra for everything. I wanted to print off our boarding passes for our flight home and had to pay $4.00 to access them and print them in there internet centre even though I had already paid for internet in my room. They also charge you to mind you bags so I didn't bother with that. Lots of little add on extras, nothing is included.Good location to everything however very windy around the hotel.Staff service is fairly average, and had to go down to the car park to get some pool towels not ideal. Leah in housekeeping was lovely I left my safe open by accident and she made sure security came up and locked it just in case and a note was left to let me know. I spoke with her when I went down to get towels and she remembered my room number and told me again about the safe. A no frills hotel, don't expect too much if you decide to stay there, however is one of the more affordable hotels for it's location.","Melbourne, Australia","Victoria B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",7,3.0

The pros of this hotel are that it is a very affordable place to stay in Hawaii, it is close to the beach and shops/restaurants, the room was clean and beds were comfortable, the front desk staff, bell man, and restaurant (Ilima Café) staff were very friendly. The Ilima Café had a great breakfast buffet for a good price. We received a discount since we stayed at the hotel. Matt at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. I cannot remember his name, but my receipt says C. Barnett was the one who helped us book our day trip to the North Shore. He was full of helpful information and very friendly. The bell man was nice enough to store our luggage for free on our last day since our flight didn't leave until 7PM. This made it possible for my family to spend our last day on the beach instead of worrying about our things. This restaurant is within walking distance of many stores and restaurants. You are literally 1 minute away from the beach. The only cons that I can think of are that our refrigerator in room 612 was not very cold, and I didn't see a setting to adjust it. I mentioned this to the front desk and the man didn't act very concerned. My husband and I chose not to worry about this minor issue since we were eating out everyday anyway. The one and only time we did put food in the fridge it reeked the next morning. There is no microwave in the room, but maybe it is a fire hazard. The noise coming from the street may be an issue for light-sleepers. It wasn't an issue for my family since we were all exhausted every night and slept like rocks. If you want less noise then you may want to move to a higher floor. And the pool was clean, but ice cold. My kids were a little disappointed that the water was freezing, because they usually love swimming in the pool, as well as the beach, when we go on vacation. Over all, we had a good stay and would return. The front of the hotel is beautiful since the lobby is open and the nice, Hawaiian breeze can be felt. Free wifi is offered in the lobby, but not in the rooms. This hotel is not ""luxury"" by any means but it was exactly what my family was looking for. Through Expedia my flights and hotel were booked for less than $4,000 and this is the type of mid-range hotel that you can expect in Hawaii for that price. If you're looking for luxury, then expect to pay about $10,000 for a weeks stay. My family spent most of our time on the beach and walking around, but it was nice to have a clean, comfortable room to return to.","Bowling Green, Kentucky","Samantha W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bowling Green, Kentucky</strong>",26,4.0

Waikiki Resort Hotel fit that bill very well. From the hotel lobby, it's a short block to Kuhio Beach Park, so there's no excuse not to hop over to the beach and enjoy some sun and surf. You also can't walk more than a block without encountering shopping and restaurants. The shopping ranges from the always-present ABC stores (which are actually quite convenient) to top-line designers such as Ferragamo or Harry Winston and brand names such as Coach, Crocs, and many others. The hotel is located about 2-3 blocks from the Royal Hawaiian Center, so if your idea of vacationing is spending a lot of time in a beautiful ocean-front shopping center, this is a good venue for you.The rooms were average (and the bathroom less-than-average) and the interior furnishings are pretty dated. The carpet in my room had definitely seen better days, and given the close proximity to the beach, it probably would have been better if the room were tiled. As it was, every time I came back from the beach I tracked sand into the room, and although it was vacuumed each day, it never felt clean. Although I have to say, even the tiled parts of the room (bathroom and closet) were not cleaned well and lots of sand was left on the floor. I'm not sure why they didn't do a better job of sweeping or vacuuming - I mean, this can't have been the first time someone tracked sand in.My room had a sink/closet area with separate toilet and bathtub. Well, I think it was a bathtub - I've literally never seen one so tiny. If you wanted to bathe small kids in it, it would be fine. For an adult, however, there would be no way to get into the tub for a relaxing bath.Housekeeping was so-so - it definitely depended on the day and the staff. Some days, the room was cleaned well and supplies restocked. Other days, they missed the trash and didn't leave me any coffee.The bed was comfortable, the flat-screen TV worked fine. I had a balcony with a ""City view"" which basically meant that I was not on the ocean side of the hotel. However, I was 14 floors up and there was a lot of wind, so I was not comfortable sitting on the balcony.Parking was available in a garage below the hotel for $25/day, with unlimited in and out. Apparently, there is other parking as well but I never figured out where it was. There is also a small laundry area (wash for $1.75, dry for $1.75 but you get 54 minutes on the dryer so that should be plenty).","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Su H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",16,3.0

I wanted to be able to close a bedroom door so when my boys wanted to stay up I didnt have to hear them. The parking every night for your rental car was crazy they say u don't have a resort fee but the parking makes up for that.

The shower is a little different to the usual but reception gives you a quick run down on how it works. Water pressure was good too.There was a small fridge and also a safe in the basin/wardrobe area which was convenient.I would have ranked the hotel a 5 except for the fact that to get wifi in your room you had to pay a daily charge of $10 or so.

It was a very convenient walk to everything we needed in Waikiki, with a nice close bus stop to get to Ala Moana etc.This is our third different hotel (roughly all in the same price bracket) on our third trip to Hawaii, but it would definitely be our favourite.

This is the biggest advantage to the hotel for it's price point.The breakfast buffet offered is very good (fresh fruit, salad, eggs, meats (at least 2 options), cereal, miso soup, plain rice porridge/juk/congee, cereal, various baked goods, juice, coffee) - So if it's part of your room rate/plan, then go for it. Most rooms have a small balcony with 2 chairs (called a lanai in Hawaii). The Korean restaurant on-site is good/tasty (moderately priced in my opinion - good portions - don't order too much, Korean dishes come with several small sides and rice - there is a small discount on most dishes if you stay at the hotel (certain deals/specials are already discounted)).Cons: The rooms are dated and need refreshing. Although it seemed clean and well maintained enough. The breakfast location is small - Get there right when they open or wait at least 30 to 45 min after they open for the initial rush to die down. I think there was free wi-fi in the lobby only (I didn't use it). The staff were friendly and helpful.We stayed there a few days just before the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor (Dec 2014) so there were several American high school bands staying in the hotel at the same time. The students were a bit rowdy and a bit disrespectful of the other hotel guests (at night and in the lobby). Thankfully, the students did not eat breakfast in the breakfast location.This is not really the hotel's ""fault"" per se but I have the strong feeling that based on the hotel's price point and location, it's popular with for tour groups or other groups. So I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of guests at the hotel on a regular basis.I did not use the pool or the spa (I think there was a spa on-site...).Other food recommendations close to the hotel: 1) For Spam Musubi fans - Musubi Cafe Iyasume - It's in the Aqua Pacific Monarch Hotel (literally a block or so from the hotel) - Next to Jinroku (Japanese restaurant - I did not eat here) - On Kuhio Avenue - Very tasty spam musubis - Cheap (abt $2.50/musubi) - Good for breakfast or a snack - The musubis are made by little old Japanese ladies - Cute place - I only tried the regular spam musubi and the bacon/egg/spam musubi, both very tasty.2) Sansei - Good and creative/interesting Sushi/Japanese/Asian fusion cuisine - They have a few locations in Hawaii (Maui (Kihei), Waikiki, etc). It's about a 7-10 min walk - To the Left after you reach the main street - On the 2nd or 3rd floor of the Marriot. 3) Cheeseburgers in Paradise - Good comfort food with some Hawaiian twists/ingredients.4) Honolulu Cookie Company - Very tasty cookies!!! - Shortbread cookies shaped liked a pineapple.There are ""ABC's"" everywhere if you need a quick convenience store. ""ABC"" stands for ""Aloha Brings Customers"" but most Hawaiians refer to it as ""All Blocks Covered."" :-) I am NOT a fan of Honolulu/Waikiki overall. It's too touristy, urban and busy. The traffic is very busy. But if you are looking for an urban location with lots of shopping, restaurants, and nightlife but next to nice beaches, then Honolulu/Waikiki is a good choice.

Other things were average. I definitely recommend much higher floor (we stayed at the 3rd level which had no views at all) since others seem to be able to have ocean views. Room was basic and mostly clean aside from a leaky shower stall, part of the bathroom door was rotted off and also we managed to kill a small cock-roach crawling around on the desk. Staff were kind and courteous and no complaints there. Just that the room was not as good. They do have a nice delicious Korean restaurant on the 2nd floor that was nice. This was not by choice since we did a tour package so I do not have exact pricing for this place but if you spend all that money and time to fly to Hawaii, I personally would prefer a nicer place for a longer stay. Also no free wifi. Not sure if this is typical of Hawaiian hotels (this was our first time here) so be aware of that as well.","Overland Park, Kansas","Ming C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Overland Park, Kansas</strong>",7,2.0

We didn't really pick the Waikiki Resort Hotel, as it came as part of a package tour we bought. Having said that though, we couldn't say we were unhappy with what we got.The Waikiki Resort Hotel is located just one block back from Waikiki beach and, therefore, very well located. It is also within walking distance of all the shopping and restaurants in Waikiki and, is well serviced by the hotel pick-up services used by the local tour organisations.Having not used any other hotels in Waikiki, it might be a little unfair to call it a B-grade hotel. I would say that it is a little older than some of the other hotels we saw; it is a little smaller [maybe that's a 'plus'].The Waikiki Resort Hotel is, though, very comfortable. The staff we dealt with were great. The rooms were very, very clean and the daily house-keeping did a wonderful job. The bell desk guys were friendly and helpful, as was 'Steve' who helped us with booking a tour.There is a very good 'convenience store' on site too.Would we stay there again? Most likely. We're not 'luxury' travellers, and like to get good value for our money. Normally, we treat hotels as just somewhere to lay our heads for the night, so we look for reasonable value.Any negatives ... specifically to our room (#1111), the toilet wailed like a banshee at every flush, right up till the cistern was fully refilled! Only a big issue if used in the middle of the night.Little niggles ... the doors to the rooms closed with a decent slam. Again, only an issue if you or your neighbour came in or went out during the night. And, the rooms could do with another mirror. Maybe a full length one behind the door, or opposite the bathroom door on the wallOh, and totally out of the Waikiki Resort Hotel's control, the Pacific Beach Hotel, which our room faced, played music into it's outdoor reception area late into the night. NOT loud annoying music; kind of at 'background' level, but still able to be heard where we were on level 11. Maybe the music lulled me to sleep, I don't know. I just remember being aware of it every night. Very light sleepers could find this a nuisance. For me, it was just 'there'. Neither really a nuisance, nor a plus.","Melbourne, Australia","JeffJaneMia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",17,4.0

William Lee was especially helpful in giving advice on good places to eat, where to get coffee, things to do, and he always answered our questions. We were in a hurry when we left, and William Lee helped me print out our boarding tickets right before our shuttle arrived.

Inside lobby is just as nice! I rate it as a five since it is well maintained, room service was great and room was better than expected. One quick minor complaint though. We arrived around 1:00 p.m., which is early since check-in is 3:00 p.m.. June , the receptionist, informed me that our room wasn't quite ready but would be soon. That was fine with me. I told her that I would wait with my family in the lobby seated since we were tired from the flight and just wanted to relax. Mind you, the seats are in direct view of the registration counter and there are four of us total. About 2:30 p.m., I went to the counter to see how much longer to wait. June was busy with another person, so I asked another employee, an older gentleman without name badge, The gentleman said "" oh, it's been ready for some time."" Why then could June not inform us earlier? It wasn't busy at any time since. Good question! Anyway, we got our room , which was 1515. The room was awesome! Two double beds with a rollaway placed in between if we wanted it. We were told that if we didn't, just roll it out to the hallway.Two teen girls did not want to share a bed so it worked out even better! That was good planning and thinking on the staffs part in my opinion. Kudos to them !! The view was impressive both for the water as well as Diamond Head. Plenty of room in the wash basin area. Bathroom isn't large but not uncomfortable to facilitate. Shower was more than adequate. Small tub not designed for bathing but that was fine with us! Small refer, closet, coffee maker ( Wolfgang Puck coffee, excellent, ooohhh!) , safe, hair dryer and iron , located in basin area. Plenty of towels, too. Nice t.v. and clock radio are in the room. Pool is on the second floor, not huge but big enough, and is great for kicking back and relaxing after a long day. Plenty of lounge chairs and was never crowded. If you needed towels for the beach, just check them out from the basement and return them afterwards. Real easy!!! Newspaper every morning in the lobby. Overall, I feel as if I got my moneys worth and MORE here at Waikiki Resort. I would definately recommend the upper rooms as there is street noise early in the morning. Not bad where we stayed but I'm sure it would be worse on lower floors. Two blocks from the beach, so its a real short walk. Oh, did I mention room service was great? Worth another mention!!! One odd quirk though. We received a flyer, left by the maid, informing us that there would be a drapery inspection between 9:00-10:00 a.m. the following day. Is that odd or what ??? We were gone at that time, so I do not know if they actually did this but I found that really strange !!! I felt as if they were checking up on us instead. Peranoid I guess. Never had that happen in ANY hotel that I have stayed at in my LIFE ! Why could they not do that in between reservations? Or why not when the maid was in our room? She was there usually mid-afternoon. Oh well, thats life. Otherwise, great place stay, disregarding the two incidences.

Nothing super fancy, but had all the basics were included. Wifi is only at the lobby, as you have to pay extra to get it in your room. I can see how this might be inconvenient for some, but it didn't bother me. You also need to pay for parking at the hotel (which hotel doesn't in Waikiki?) but you're really close to the Zoo and Aquarium area that you can manage to find free overnight parking there if you are okay with walking 10 minutes or so. It's a nice comfortable walk along the beach in the evening anyways, so why not enjoy it? There are two restaurants at the hotel, which we did not eat at. Given that the hotel is owned by Koreans, it's not surprising that one of the restaurants was a Korean BBQ at a very competitive price. So the bottom line is, if you're looking for a true resort getaway in Waikiki, this might not be your place. For those who want to spend more on the things to do while in Honolulu other than the room you're sleeping in, I'd recommend this place.",,jackperng,3,4.0

I am a planner.. so I spent a lot of time reviewing and I must say the pictures had me feeling like ehhhh...not enthused. But once we checked in a was totally removing my foot from my mouth!Like I said, there were three of us in a double room. The hotel put in a cot, right in the middle. The cot was more comfortable than my mattress at home! Sure it made the room a little tighter, but that was the least of our worries! The room was extremely clean and tidy. Standard and clean bathroom. Tight shower. Nothing to complain about! The only thing that I really didnt like about the room was that balcony door that took way too much strength to open, but THE VIEW MADE UP FOR IT!! We were in room 617. Amazing!Lobby was beautiful and open. Free wifi downstairs. Sushi bar isnt really that good but its ok for a late night snack and karaoke.Pool is very nice and usually empty since the beach is less than a block away. Perfect for a little getaway or just a mid day relaxation laying out.Guests were somewhat quiet. Lots of asian tourist moving about in the morning that were kind of noisy but nothing to complain about. Really, I cant think of anything bad about this hotel. Dave at the front desk was really cool!

Yes we weren't right on the beach but as we were travelling as a family of 5, the options become limited. We booked two rooms with an interconnecting door and we were happy with the beds, space and rooms. The only negative I have would be how to operate the bath and shower. There were no clear instructions so we had to contact the front desk to find out. We didn't use the restaurants so can't comment on them. This hotel has a laundry in the basement which we used almost everyday as we had young kids and never had any problems with it being too busy.

Some of the pictures that were shown didn't match what we got at all. Essentially, a corner room gives you a slightly larger mini-refrigerator, microwave and a sink with a few plates and utensils. The room is also slightly larger than a standard room. The hotel is older as is evidenced by the upgrades made when an automatic fire sprinkler system was installed in the building. Also the rest of the construction says 60s at least to me. Fortunately, we did not go to Hawaii to stay in our hotel room.Check-in was fast and the staff was friendly. You have to pay $22 bucks a day for parking. Wifi is free in the lobby but if you want it in your room, you have to pay about $10 a day per device. Come on. This, today, is liking charging extra for sheets on your bed. One of the biggest headaches is that the street outside is so busy and so noisy that using the balcony or leaving the sliding glass door open is next to impossible unless you just want to drown out the noise from your significant other. ... Ouch! She just slapped me... The street is a one way street and there are service vehicles and tour buses using it all day long as well as regular traffic. The street is narrow and it is amazing that they can actually get two buses on the road side by side. One morning, a food truck stopped on the street to deliver to the hotel next door and the noise from his cooler was just unbearable. The next day, someone was jack-hammering on the parking structure next door. The noise was a real downer for me.One other minor irritation was the bathroom layout. It is the type with the tub and toilet in one room while the vanity is in another open to the bedroom. I'm an early riser and I don't like to turn on lights to wake everyone else up. The vanity room needed to be separated from the rest of the room by a door. Oh, and there was only one light switch for both the bathroom and the vanity room. It was all or nothing. speaking of baths, here is a tip when in Hawaii. Open a window in the bathroom and take a bath/shower with just enough hot water to not make it icy. I took a hot shower the first day and just couldn't cool off enough to get the water off of me so getting dressed was no fun with clothes sticking to my wet skin. The rest of the week I was just fine using my own tip.All in all, it was o.k. but next time I'll probably shop around for a different place.","Lindon, Utah","Pittakos</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lindon, Utah</strong>",31,3.0

This was really great of the hotel to do. I was on the 6th floor and had a partial ocean view. I could also see Diamond Head. The rooms all have nice patios with chairs and a small table. I was worried the noise would be loud from the street but I did not have any issues. The noise in the resort was also minium with people coming and going at different hours. I've read reviews about the showers and tubs being small but I did not notice that, and I am not a small guy. I tried the breakfast buffet at Ilima Cafe and it was pretty good. They have your typical items like bacon, scrammbled eggs, Portuguese sausage, fresh fruit...etc. It was enough to get the day started. For dinner I decided to try Seoul Jung as guests receive a discount. The prices are a little high and I am not exactly sure what everything was. I tried the BulGoGi or marinated beef, and it was outstanding. You also receive 6 little sides and a bowl of soup, so you definately do not go hungry. I would have dined there again, but I had to try other restaurants. The pool was never super busy so it was a nice place to lay and relax in the sun, without the noise of the beach.

Staff are nice , and the breakfast buffet is very decent with a good range (fresh pineapples were awesome) and 2 adult brekky coupons are usually included when you book on their website, but if you have 2 kids like we do, dont worry, kids under 12 are half price at $7 each. They also have self service laundry facilities in the basement which is so needed for young families. Pool was good as well, although the beach meant we hardly used it.

I never leave comments about a trip but I completely forgot to leave a tip in my room which is why I am leaving a feedback. It's the least I can do. I usually judge a hotel by its bed and bathroom. They were both very clean. The bed was so comfortable. I love the white sheets. They cleaned my room everyday. Hotels usually don't have a window in the bathroom but this hotel did!!! The fresh air flowing through, cleans sheets, the ocean view... I couldn't have asked for more. Oh, and here's a bonus. Location! Shopping and restaurants are right down the block.

The lady who checked us in was very nice, I think her name was Nancy?? Lobby was very nice and open - very welcoming. Wi-Fi worked great. There was a handy little shop with groceries and souvenirs, but we got shouted at by shop assistant for walking in with drinks - so didnt go back in after that!Room and balcony was a decent size. Two double beds and a good sized television with lots of stations. Bathroom was quite small with a low bath. Could not work out how to use shower. Had to go down to reception where the staff member whipped out a dummy tap and showed us how to use. Saw that dummy tap on quite a few occasions when other guests were asking how to use it, so I don't know why they haven't included instructions in the rooms.Rooms also featured a good sized safe (would fit a laptop easily, both our ipads got in there) and a fridge.On one day housekeeping did not make our room up. After two visits to reception it was finally done that evening.They tried to blame the ""do not disturb"" sign but we had removed this from our door after 10:00amBut again reception staff were very helpful and apologetic and got it all resolved for us.Hope to return to Honolulu at some point and would consider this hotel again.","London, United Kingdom","Gingeyjack</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",14,4.0

Stayed on the 16th floor - had a nice view of city, diamond head and some ocean view, the room was close to the elevator and thought it would be a problem but it wasn't nor did we hear and street level noise some have mentioned. Beds where comfortable, bathroom clean, one block from the beach - very easy walking to many of the area sites. Felt safe at all times, this was never an issue for us - there was a safe in the room for some valuables. Front desk was helpful, pool was clean, refreshing and fun at night, with pool and beach towels easily available.

Keep in mind if you are not travelling with your husband.parking is 22 usd per day.The staff, including the guy at the concierge, the housekeeper and the girl at the reception was great: always nice to us and smiling. Everyone except for a man we met at the front desk on our last night. The WI-FI was not working and i ask to him a suggestion on how to connect for having our fligh check-in done. Not jocking: he was like not paying attention to me as i wasn't there, He gave any answer but ""is not working"". So rude and i still can't get the point!!I know his name, but don't want to make it public.At the end on the day, i think i would search for another place to be the next time.","Milan, Italy","russolalaura</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milan, Italy</strong>",29,2.0

We had an oceanview room for 4 nights on the 17th floor which was pretty dated and not very clean. The carpet and furnishings are not up to scratch just like in the large entry foyer/ reception area. The small shower over a child size bath with curtain feels closed in and worse than the cruise ship we got off from. Free WiFi is only available in the foyer which is inconvenient at night when you want to relax in the privacy and comfort of your room with a drink while on line. In room our phone not working caused us to miss booking an excursion. When we reported it ,were told that local calls should be made from pay phone in foyer. WHAT ??Double glazing would be good to stop the noise from traffic and building work in the early morning hours when you want to sleep in.On the positive, it is a short stroll to the beach, lots of eateries and public transport, with friendly staff.",australia,"speaktruly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>australia</strong>",86,3.0

I chose this one because it is the farthest away from the area of upscale hotels closer to Honolulu and shopping at high end stores. We missed our first night because of United airlines so we only got to spend 2 nights. We had the balcony over looking a small stretch of beach and we could see Diamond Head in the other direction. The room was small but just fine. I wish they had more mirrors. There is only one mirror in the bathroom,and none in the main room. All the employees are friendly and helpful. The bell captain was extremely helpful on the day we checked out but did not leave for the ship until 2 PM. This is a Korean owned and run hotel and the breakfast buffet (included in our package) was great. They had both American and Korean type food. I loved having a salad and beef and radish soup (mostly a tasty broth) for breakfast.","Grinnell, Iowa","Susan M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Grinnell, Iowa</strong>",28,5.0

Waikiki Beach was just across the street, so we had a most wonderful time walking along the beach. The hotel had a delicious buffet breakfast as well.

We found it with this place. Very impressive lobby area, but arn't they all. The thing that struck us first was there are no doors to the lobby. Completely open, sounds weird but actually it is really good.The reception staff were very friendly and we checked in in no time. The room was not to bad, a little shabby and dated, nothing too special really but very clean and very comfortable. A nice two minutes stroll to the main front and beach and all the shops and restaurants, all very expensive and only fair quality.Not a bad place to stay and yes we would stay here again. Bad points. Internet is very expensive in your room. $10 per day and the car parking in very expensive too. If you rent a car the guys are the rental company will give you an idea where to park that is a two minute walk away from the hotel and cost less than half the price. The hotel also charge 75 cents to make a free local call. So be aware of all the extras.Apart from that, not to bad really.","Carlisle, United Kingdom","AlabamaRon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carlisle, United Kingdom</strong>",80,3.0

We had family friends who were at the hotel and as the bookings were made together we had arranged for the friend to notify the staff there. As we resulted in paying for another airline to guarantee that we would make the flight, we also specified the new date in which we were to arrive and even offered to pay the days we could not attend.The lady at the desk said that they were unable to keep the booking for us and we would just have to wait and see once we arrived. Upon arrival, after much waiting at the desk they gave us our new rooms and had upgraded one of the rooms to a king suite due to low availability within the hotel.The rooms were not very spacious for what we were paying, but the rooms had a spectacular view and were looking out on to the beach. The hotel was quite nice but there were so many groups of students from Korea and Japan and it felt overrun with teenage school kids and it was annoying when trying to wait for an elevator. The hotel was a block away from the beach and about a 7 mins walk from the main tourist streets within Waikiki.It is an amazing part of the world to travel to, and I feel like for what we paid, we got quite a nice deal as there were many more hotels that looked more outdated and similarly priced. It can be quite difficult to choose hotels within Waikiki because many of the newer, 5 star rated hotels were much more than if it were in another location.","Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","Gemma A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Victoria, Australia</strong>",7,4.0
