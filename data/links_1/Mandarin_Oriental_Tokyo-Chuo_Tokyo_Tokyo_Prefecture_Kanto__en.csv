Impeccable service like any other MO. Bath products are made of BV, which is especially easy to use. Clean and tidy room, comfortable bed, very good view from the room. There are two restaurants for breakfast. One is self-help and the other is fixed food. Both restaurants are very nice. There are several Michelin restaurants in Tokyo, so you can eat well at the hotel. The Wenhua Bakery on the first floor is also very good. Cloud cake is said to be very popular.

It was everything you'd expect from a Mandarin. The room was spacious and well maintained with amazing views of the city below. Excellent spa facilities. What most stood out, however, was the quality of the service -- personal attention at every turn. The concierge was very helpful in arranging dinner and show reservations. I left my glasses in a taxi one evening and the bell captain managed to track down the taxi and get them back. The location in the Nihonbashi area is well suited for touring the city. The hotel is directly on top of Mitsukoshimae Station, which serves the Ginza and Hanzomon subway lines. You get the benefit of easy access to different parts of the city while staying in an area that is quieter and less frenetic than the Ginza or Shibuya. I recommend joining Fans of Mandarin Oriental.

Madaoka san (the receptionist) took us to the room and we enjoyed talking with her. After that we didn't get to see her until the day we checked out but she saw us at the reception when we were checking out and talked to us again. It was very nice of her. Okazaki San was also nice and welcoming us upon check in and we just felt like we came back to our home in Tokyo!The room was clean (as always) and it was really spotless. I cannot imagine all the effort and the care they put to make sure the room to be always clean. One morning, I was in a hurry and had to leave the room with my cosmetics all over the place but when I came back to the room, cleaning was done and my cosmetics were neatly put besides the sink. Other hotels do that too but I think the ""Mandarin way"" is the best. We also enjoyed the buffet breakfast in the morning. We didn't ask for anything but they gave us a small fruits platter with ""welcome to Tokyo"" message written on it with chocolate. We have never experienced that at other hotels we stayed. :) We cannot wait to go back to stay at Mandarin again.

We stayed here for part of our wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time. The rooms are large with great views of Tokyo, understated but luxurious, and the bathrooms are just amazing. Well-kitted out too, with Bottega toiletries. They also use a lovely essential oil in the room which was blended especially for the hotel. It has a very distinctive but relaxing scent. We got the restaurant bookings we asked for, although my one negative comment would be that the team was probably not very well organised and would forget our requests until we reminded them. We did one dinner at Tapas Molecular Bar which was very special - only 8 seats per night. Coupled with the view and the “show” from the chef (who hails from HK!) and his team, it was very memorable.

The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful, the main lobby is on the 38th floor and the rooms are in the floors below (which always caused me some confusion but that's on me not the hotel). The room was beautiful and finely finished with full height windows with an amazing view of the Tokyo Skytree. The furnishings were up to par and the bed was sumptuous. The dining options in this hotel are top shelf with not one but two Michelin starred restaurants. We ate in the french restaurant and it was fabulous. The other Michelin is a Chinese restaurant that we didn't try. They also have an Italian restaurant that is excellent. We had dinner there and it was amazing. The breakfast brunch is also served in that venue and it was a smallish but very high quality buffet with some excellent items that where made to order (try the Ritz pancakes -- incredible). We also tried the spa and it was excellent with a therapeutic pool that overlooked the city -- amazing. A truly first class spa I should add. My first knock and the reason for the four stars was the concierge -- frankly I didn't think they were all that. They were nice and helpful but not quite the level of concierge that I'm used to from a Mandarin or other equivalent hotel. Maybe it was a language or cultural issue but they didn't seem to go out of their way unlike the other concierges that I had later in my trip through Asia. My second knock is that they seem to allow smoking in the bar which is on the floor right below the main lobby. The smoke wafts up from the bar and taints the whole lobby. One of the reasons I love the Mandarin in Vegas is that it's the only hotel that doesn't allow any smoking. I would note that the bar itself is beautiful and the bartender (I think his name was Add) was a true mixologist. See photo!! All in all, though, I would recommend staying here. You really can't get much better (if at all), the hotel is clean, modern, luxurious and with all the amenities you would expect from a Mandarin.","New York City, New York","RubenO942</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",4,4.0

Each time we were struck by the beautiful and pristine rooms, the excellent restaurants and spa, and (most importantly) the incredibly thoughtful staff. The spa is perhaps the best I have ever visited, with amazing views and skilled therapists. I greatly enjoyed dining at Sense and Sushi Shin, along with having breakfast in the hotel's charming lounge. At each, the service and food were impeccable. But what stood out to me most was the care and intelligence of the staff, particularly with small details that would be easy to overlook. Here's one example: I asked the hotel for help mailing to the US an unwieldy gift I had bought which didn't fit into my suitcase. I filled out a form for the package with the mailing address, item value, etc., and the package promptly arrived the day I got back. It sounds simple, and they made it simple. But when the package arrived, I noticed I had actually made an error filling out the form, but they had carefully read my entries on the form, noticed the mistake, and fixed it. Also, the actual box they shipped the gift in was unconventionally shaped, suggesting to me that either they have a vast assortment of packaging on site, just on the off chance someone needs it, or that they went out to acquire a specialized package. Either way, the experience showed that the hotel took great care to make sure the package delivery went smoothly. That's just one example; moments like this happened constantly. For instance, we noted to a staff member that we particularly appreciated something we'd tried at the hotel, and later found a gift of this item in our room. The concierge's recommendations were always great. And housekeeping was extremely thoughtful: they noticed we preferred to have no throw pillows or decorative items on the bed, as we had removed them and set them on the couch, so instead of replacing them on the bed daily, they set them aside unobtrusively in the closet. The care and attention left us delighted and touched. We are very much looking forward to our return.","New York City, New York","jtm852</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",0,5.0

From the minute we arrived to the minute we left, the employees worked in a way that earned my confidence in them. Upon arrival, the bellhop commanded the driveway for easy loading and unloading. The employees were eager to help carry luggage and provide assistance to get checked in. The lobby was on the 38 floor so we had a bellhop accompany us directly to the reception area. From there, the employees had a file of our stay, got us checked in, and explained amenities. They were very organized and knew exactly when we would be there, our travel plans, and reservations. The concierge was equally helpful. We contacted them even before we left for Japan and they were able to get reservations for us. They also pointed out excellent areas to visit and were able to contact our travel agency when we asked them to do so. Everyone was extremely kind and courteous. I could go on for days about how excellent the customer service is. Customer service aside, the views from this place...AMAZING! It’s in a very tall building where you can basically see all of Tokyo. On clear days, you can even seen Mount Fuji. The rooms were extremely luxurious and clean. I’m am OCD about hotels being clean and this one receives my stamp of approval. The toilets had heated seats. (I never appreciated this until I experienced it.) The room had many high tech features. There were floor to ceiling windows. The list goes on for days. The gym was equally luxurious. There was a lot of cardio equipment and some weights.

Conveniently located for Tokyo Station and the Underground Rail and within easy access of lots of stuff that's wort visiting.The room was immaculate, well appointed and had a distant view of Mount Fuji. All staff were engaging and in particular, I must mention the lobby ambassador, Chiharu Hashimoto, who provided us with a very warm greeting, and was of much assistance during our 5 night stay. She is a credit to the MO organisation. In fact, all staff that we dealt with were excellent, including housekeeping who we never saw in person but clearly did great work.The cocktail bar is well worth a visit. Great drinks, very well managed by the engaging Fu-Fu (hope I got her name correct) and a superb night view over Tokyo from the non-smoking section (yep, Japan still allows smokers to puff away indoors - so 1980's!). The rest of the hotel looks to be non-smoking.If you want to eat at the hotel's Michelin Starr 'Tapas Molecular Bar' get your reservation made before you turn up. We tried to book when we checked in only to find it was fully reserved for the whole of our 5 night stay. Luckily there was a cancellation a few days later and we managed to get in on our last day. It's pricey but it's more than just a meal - it's entertainment too - and be sure to get the wine paring.In my opinion, the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo is so much nicer than the Shangri-La just down the road.","London, United Kingdom","paulwW767UB</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",13,5.0

Booking us 2 twins(which are more like full beds) which would have placed my teen daughters on opposite sides of the hotel floor. Book directly, email them. I was very nervous because after spending 2+ hours and 2 days with AMEX they couldn’t figure it out. Unknown to me Platinum cards travel is just Expedia! Join the MO Fan and get same benefits. And the hotel emailed me to let me know that this would have happened. So here’s where Nao stepped in and despite fully booked because of holiday in Japan, we were able to get adjoining rooms after 3 days. She spoke flawless English and gave me many tips especially to the mochi place in Ginza that is part of turndown. She’s an asset to the hotel. I just felt service that was behind the scenes flawless execution and really trying hard even if things aren’t perfect. Comparable to my other fav hotel Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills. My daughter loved the spa and fitness areas there were killer views.The attention to details as you can see are amazing from a pillow bar, mochi to the aromatherapy oil. The views are KILLER! The warm Toto seats and towel bars are super nice touches.Breakfast buffet was too good, going home with a few extra pounds. The eggs are a bright orange and the pancake is not like an American pancake but more like a chiffon cake. Lots of dim sum and Japanese dishes too. The breakfast curry was to die for. The chefs are real serious about serving great food. Omelets and eggs dish lean more toward Eastern style and taste.A week in Japan we were really craving home food and they did accommodate us with pizza room service which was darn good NYC like pizza. I think it was expensive but very tasty.Concierge could be more helpful with dining choices but I found Yelp super helpful. It’s not about what you spend but how good the food is or if like us we want quick meals.Hubby had a $25 orange from their market, he said it was the best orange he tasted. Food looked so perfect it looked fake.Lastly, I’m super happy to stay in this part of town. The other areas are overcrowded with people and being from California and living in hills I felt like Disneyland level of people in a lot of Japan. I really like a quiet hotel where I’m not hearing a lot of guests or staff. I love being way up high too. The BED! Only other bed this comfortable is my own at home. I have major insomnia and this was the only hotel I’ve ever stayed in that I’ve gotten great sleep! I’ve stayed at Four Seasons and other 5 stars all over the world - none in Japan but this was a slice of luxury comfort. I got the aromatherapy pillow and my girls the booster.I recommend wearing layers because the heat is pumped in all over. I had a short sleeve T-shirt with a thin down jacket - was most comfortable.

I wanted to stay near Tokyo Station for convenience, since I would be arriving on the shinkansen from Kyoto, going to Tokyo Disney and also back to Narita on the Narita Express--all journeys beginning and/or ending at Tokyo Station. I had spent my first night in Japan at the Tokyo Station Hotel and had booked there for this 2nd segment as well. But when the Mandarin offered a complimentary 4th night, it was an offer I couldn't refuse. Although the Tokyo Station Hotel stay was perfect, my Mandarin Oriental stay was even more perfect and sumptuous.The Mandarin is about a 10-15 minute walk from Tokyo Station. Via email, the hotel staff had recommended I take a taxi from the station, but I opted to walk and got a bit lost, despite my pocket WiFi device. This never happened again after receiving proper directions from the hotel staff. Note if you do walk from the station, make sure you take the Nihonbashi exit. You will cross the famous Nihonbashi Bridge, originally built in the 1600's, with its current version completed in 1911.The Mandarin occupies the top floors of a 38-story office building, the Nihonbashi Mitsui Tower designed by Cesar Pelli. The street entrance has a lobby plus access to the office building, but the main lobby/reception area is on the 38th floor. Several restaurants and the fitness centre are also on this level. One story below (37th floor) are more restaurants and lounges, plus the Spa. All rooms are situated on floors below these down to the 30th floor. Ballrooms, the chapel, offices and the Business Centre are on the 3rd floor. My booking was for a Mandarin Grand room. These rooms are larger that the Deluxe rooms (especially the dressing/closet area) and all have Mt Fuji views. The room was indeed grand and filled with amenities and features expected from the Mandarin brand. I immediately noticed the similarities in decor, especially in the bathroom, between this Mandarin and my favourite Mandarin, the iconic and classic circa 1960's Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong. The extensive use of wood paneling, the granite bathroom with its black marble sink, the tortoise-shell-like accents on the bath fixtures, the sliding mirror all brought back fond memories. The only thing lacking was the signature Mandarin scent that I would notice in the hallways of several Mandarins I've stayed at. At nightly turndown, however, the housekeeper would leave a small dish with a soothing oil that would perfume the room, plus a mochi treat The room of course had the Mandarin's signature valet door. There were plush terrycloth robes and slippers, plus lighter-weight printed-fabric robes suitable for onsen. Pajamas were available upon request. There was a humidifier/air purifier, fixings for coffee and tea. The bathroom had a tub with an adjacent granite shower with THREE heads. There were shuttered windows into both the bedroom and dressing area. The room itself had electronically controlled shades both opaque and transluscent. Although I never heard any noise from the hallway or adjacent rooms, I would hear the footsteps of guests staying directly above me. The hotel has quite a few dining and lounging options. I would highly recommend joining the Mandarin chain's Fan of M.O. program, which entitles you to several perks of your choice. I opted for complimentary daily breakfast, plus a dining credit. An extensive breakfast buffet is served daily at K'shiki (egg dishes and pancakes are made to order), which seems popular with locals also. The restaurant offers Italian fare for other meals, complete with a pizza bar fronting the pizza oven.A set breakfast (Japanese or Western) is offered in the Oriental Lounge.I chose to use my dining credit at Ventaglio, located on the 2nd floor of the Tower lobby, somewhat disconnected from the hotel. It offers an extensive Mediterranean buffet for both lunch and dinner that is also popular with locals.The hotel also has French and Chinese restaurants, a molecular gastronomy restaurant, a tea bar plus a regular bar and a gourmet shop for sweet and savoury bites on the first floor. The sushi restaurant is currently closed and being revamped. I actually ate several meals within Tokyo Station. Just inside the Nihonbashi entrance are 2 levels of small restaurants each specializing in a particular type of (mostly Japanese) food. Delish and budget friendly. Service throughout the hotel was impressive--people almost breaking into sprints to help you, staff respectfully bowing. Particularly helpful for me was concierge Masahiro, who gave superb directions.Overall an outstanding and impressive stay.",Los Angeles CA,"pillowsofwanderlust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles CA</strong>",1202,5.0

I wish there were more stars on TripAdvisor, as this hotel deserves more than five. Everything feels new and a bit better than you might find in other hotels. The view is likely the best in all of Tokyo, whether you're on the Mt. Fuji or SkyTree side (I preferred the SkyTree side, with slightly more sweeping views and a spectacular sunrise). The bar also has great views, but is absolutely worth it just for the drinks and service. Head bartender FuFu took great care of us and makes outstanding drinks. Walk into the fitness centre and you are greeted with a towel and immediate offer to help you get comfortable with their facilities. Best view ever from an elliptical or rowing machine. Same for the pool. And the breakfast buffet. The dim sum was a highlight, as was their house ""eggs benedict"" with crab and avocado. Special thanks to Ms. Hashimoto for taking my luggage and key and sorting my checkout when I was late for a meeting. Might have to surprise my wife with a night there for our next anniversary.

Igor Apratz, the hotel manager himself, was there to greet us in person with Nao Kobayashi, their Guest Relations Officer who was awesome! I really recommending signing up for the free Fans of M.O. program, which gets you complimentary upgrades a free breakfast!Nao, who left us several surprises and touches thoughout our honeymoon stay, whisked us to our upgraded deluxe room (huge and gorgeous btw), prepared this beautiful fresh red rose petal heart display accompanied by these pairs of amazing white swans kissing each other made out of bath towels (I've attached a picture). Now if that wasn't already enough, Nao also greeted us with maybe the most amazing strawberry shortcake that i have ever more. Now Japanese people are known for their mastery of elevating something to an even higher level (more on this later). This strawberry shortcake baked in house and made to say, perfection, would be an understatement. A lot of hotels have restaurants that usually are..eh. But Mandarin Hotel Tokyo has 4 restaurants, 2 of which are Michelin star restaurants and one that should be (more on this later too) and an in house Bakery that is to typical of that Japanese way of perfecting things, perfect artisanal croissants (had lots of those in the morning), perfect strawberry shortcakes with just the right balance of strawberries, and cream and just the right amount of sugar and a swirl of crushed nuts on the outside. I'm still salivating about that. It's not easy to get a cake right in this modern day of mass production but the flaky crust was well, perfection.When we told Nao that my wife was pregnant that we'd prefer to exchange the complimentary bottle of champagne in our honeymoon suite for a bottle of Pellegrino, you know what she did? She got us a bottle So Jennie, a premium non-alcoholic champagne bottled IN FRANCE. I am so grateful for this because the only non-alcoholic champagne or wine I've had is basically glorified grape juice. This was anything but. It tasted like the best grape extracts without any added sugars and by the way it wrapped my palate in ectasy, it must be made the traditional Champagne method or something very similar. Nao taught me something my wife and I will remember the rest of our lives that this is what we will drink every time all of our friends have champagne and we want to join to fun but just sans the alcohol. Breakfast was a delightful joy every morning. The freshest fruits, vegetables, pastries, eggs, dear god, everything was the highest quality. I guess that's what you get for staying a a hotel with 2 Michelin Star restaurants and their own artisanal bakery. Every morning, my wife and I were attended by someone that we found out later was one of their management trainees, Flora Hye Soo Shin who had a musicality and gracefulness in your attentive and warm hospitality and, I really must say, Flora was, I guess in retrospect that every single staff member at the hotel, always looked perfect. Every hair in place, every thread of her uniform perfect. She always remembered that we loved San Pellegrino in the mornings and made sure our glasses were filled always. We always saw Flora at 6:30AM every morning so I was astonished when one evening, on the advice of the executive chef Daniele Cason, we hard core NYers opted to have pizza of all things Pizza Bar 38, we saw Flora in the evening hour, again perfectly coifed, perfectly fresh and perky attending to us at the Pizza bar. OK, two things. What?! Apparently, all the staff at Mandarin Oriental wear multiple hats, have multiples skill sets and tireless dedication to their jobs. When we asked her if she was tired after having served us at 6:30am in the morning and now into the evening, she, without even the slightest hint of fatigue that she was well rested and relished the opportunity to serve us again. Wow. Apparently this must be the culture of hospitality so deeply ingrained in their staff from top to bottom, because honestly the hotel manager Igor, who greeted us late at night when we arrived for our honeymoon, I saw early in the morning as well, fully in command and just like all of the entire staff, crisp, organized but relaxed and running every facet with precision.I need to say one thing about the corporate culture at Mandarin Oriental Tokyo. Their management empowers their staff to go above and beyond, to write us a little personal notes, to take time to really let us know the wonders of what makes them so special.Remember when i mentioned Flora worked the night shift same day after serving us on the breakfast shift at 6:30am. Couple of things i wish to say about that night.1) We ordered and savored our bottle of San Pelligrino sparkling water and declined to order. Flora sensed we would've loved more and she sent a few bottles to our room along with such such a lovely personal note. Kudoes Mandarin Oriental and the hotel Manager Igor. They empower their team members to take initiative and coddle their loyal guests. Bravo. It's the mark of a consumnate hospitality manager to entrust and empower. Says a lot about the top level managers and perhaps even more of their faith and belief in the team all the way down the line. Impressive. This is on top of all the premium fruit plates with HAPPY HONEYMOON written in chocolate from Flora at breakfast! Quick shout out to to the awesome manager Yoji Osada who greets us at the door as we come for our table! What wonderful smiles and Japanese bows all around!2) I want to speak about the Pizza alla Palla Pizzaolo, which is Italian for Pizza Maker. First let’s start with Executive Chef Daniele Cason’s pizza. We are from NYC and for me to talk about Pizza somewhere, well, it is something. Pizza Bar 38 at MO Tokyo is made in the style of Pizza made in Rome for centuries, what they call Pizza alla Palla. Is is truly out of this world and it is NOT easy to make. In my opinion, the best pizza int he world comes from NYC BUT let me qualify. The best Pizza in the world that is made quickly and from mass produced ingredients. Having said that, NYC city, yes, the city that never sleeps, does NOT have the best PIZZA. THE WORLD’S BEST PIZZA, must be made of the WORLD’S BEST INGREDIENTS, the best tomatoes, the best Bufalo Mozzarela and the BEST FLOUR. PiZZA BAR 38 HAS ALL THAT AND THE FLOUR THAT THEY USE IS SLOW MILLED BY MULES TURNING A STONE GRINDER (YES, THE SAME METHOD DONE IN ITALY FOR HUNDREDS IF NOT A THOUSAND OR MORE YEARS. They import it from Italy: Marino Flour, Mulino a Petra Naturale Della Langa. It is wow. Something about using only slow ground flour maintains the heartiness the vitamins the soul of the pizza dough. Modern bleached machine milled flour is just, well, nothingness. No flavor, no body, no soul, much less nutrients. The heat of the machine quick grinding of wheat destroys all that. Pizza Bar 38 at Manarin Oriential makes it exactly like the Romans have done for a millennia. Daniele Cason has shaped and trained Yuichi Ito, his Japanese Pizzaolo in Japan into a Master that leavens the bread for 48 hours until it is a cloud, yes, a cloud of dough, soft as the clouds in the sky if you could actually reach them. The result is the world’s highest finest Pizza crust. No one is better. No one. I actually thought Yuichi was Italian. With his Italian Pizza hat and warm bubbly Italian friendliness, somehow I blocked out in my mind and honestly though he was Italian. He had taken his training so well and sooo soo oud and into his craft that he breathed and lived as master Italian Pizzaolo from Rome. What Hotel in the world, really, has 2 Michelin Star restaurants and better get a 3rd for Pizza 38 or that would truly be a crime against the culinary world. You know sometimes when you see an Academy Award Winning performer and what makes his so good is that he is not acting. He is being. Yuicihi Ito is truly a master Pizzaolo in the centuries old tradition of Roma Italia. Bravissimo to the hotel Manager Igor Apraiz and his team. There are world class hotels and there are world class resorts. Somehow Mandarin Oriental Tokyo has both in one location. mastered I daresay. Truly remarkable. Bravissimo once again.","Hong Kong, China","robertcNYC212</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",1,5.0

It did all the basics well, cannot complain about the room other than the lighting in the bathroom which was underpowered particlaury around the basin, that too was undersized and awkward to use, should have been two basins with a decent amount of worktop to place your washbag on. Even the Bottega shampoo & conditioner seemed to have been stuck solid in the bottle.We found the buffet breakfast acceptable but get there too late and it feels like a rush,wolfing down your food before it all gets taken away. The signature eggs benedicte is nice but they must do something about the congealed hollandaise sauce. Surely this is not acceptable?The communal areas we found lacking, whilst running the gauntlet through the smoke filled bar between the two restaurants, this could have been better thought out. The bar was small but provided very good cocktails and drinks but as a non-smoker found it stuffy and the hotel jazz band would grind on you night after night - a little more variety would have been better received. This hotel lacked outdoor space, not surprising being on the 38th floor, maybe then maybe not. We have stayed in city hotels in NY, Bangkok and Seoul that are all high rise blocks and all had outside terraces and rooftop bars that gave you a hit of fresh air and openness. We used the spa once but were uninspired by it. Personally, there was no wow factor in this hotel and we found it sterile and lacking atmosphere, if you are looking for a stay that is well organised and good service then it is fine.

My fiance and I book a big vacation every year, but this year was special because we were celebrating our engagement. We decided to book a three-week trip starting in Singapore, then Bali, and finally ending in Tokyo. As an aside, we stayed at luxury five-star resorts at each destination (and always stay at five-star hotels whenever we travel, whether it's for vacation or business). During this trip, the service at each resort was exactly what you'd expect from a luxury hotel - each day, the hotels left little treats for us to celebrate our engagement, the staff would bend over backwards to accommodate any of our requests, every single staff person knew our names, and so forth. And then we got to Mandarin Oriental. I live in Vegas half of the time and the Bay Area for the other half; there used to be Mandarin Oriental properties at each place and I would go frequently for high tea, to the spa, or for staycations. When I first started going to MO in the Bay and Vegas, it set the standard for five-star service. I never had any problems at the Bay Area location, but about three years ago the service really started to go downhill at the Vegas location. I should've known better, but I thought that since we would be in Tokyo where service tends to be exceptional wherever you go, then the service at MO would be good. Unfortunately, I was wrong. It started when I emailed the hotel several months prior to our arrival to ask if we could do early check-in. Our flight was arriving into Tokyo at 9:00 a.m. and I figured that even going through customs and driving to MO, we would arrive at MO by noon. I offered to pay extra to check in early, thinking that we would be required to pay maybe $300 since we would only be a few hours early. The reservation desk replied to my inquiry, saying that they could not guarantee early check-in, that they would allow us to do early check-in if a room was ready, and if we needed a guarantee that we could check in early, we should pay for one extra night beginning on the night prior to our arrival date. While I understand that this is probably hotel policy, as a five-star and very expensive hotel, MO's job should be to provide the best customer service it can possibly provide. Telling a guest to pay for one extra night in order to check in three hours early is not, in my opinion, five-star service, particularly when MO appeared to have availability. If it didn't, why would they even suggest that we pay for one extra night? If the rooms were sold out, I would've understood where they were coming from with their response but that didn't seem to be the case. Things just got worse when we got there. Some of the things we noticed (too many to remember): the entire lobby on the 38th floor smelled like smoke (disgusting to us non-smokers), the water closet in our room smelled like urine, housekeeping was inconsistent and sometimes didn't restock our shampoo and body wash, there were guests above us that we could hear running back and forth early in the morning and late at night, several times there was no one at the reception desk or concierge to help us when we had questions, and a few times no one was at the desk on the ground floor (we would ask them for assistance hailing a cab, so we had to wait around for a bit on the several occasions when no one was there). The worst part came on our last night when we went down to the reception desk to request late checkout (by 3:30 p.m.) since our car service wasn't picking us up until then. The young man at the reception desk was nice enough, and after 15 minutes of him checking his computer and speaking with colleagues, he advised us that we could check out at 1:00 p.m. for no extra charge. However, if we wanted to stay until 3:30, we would need to pay 3780 yen, which is just a little under $30. While I understand that the extra charge is again likely hotel policy, if a hotel has capacity, would it really hurt to let guests stay a few extra hours at no charge? (side note - one of our resorts in Bali gave us late checkout at 9 p.m. to accommodate our late flight). In any event, given the relatively small extra charge, which we made it a point to confirm with the staff person at least three times, we agreed to pay the 3780 yen. About an hour later, the reception desk called our room, said they had made a mistake with the price, and that it would instead by $258 to stay until 3:30. We declined and advised that we would check out by 1:00 p.m. to avoid any extra charges. In our opinion, since the hotel made the mistake and we confirmed three or more times that it would only be the $30, the hotel should've honored the original price. My fiance, who is the most easygoing guy in the world and rarely ever gets upset, was absolutely furious and said that that ruined our last night there. Again, we understand that the $258 charge was hotel policy, but MO clearly wasn't fully booked as they were willing to allow us to stay if we paid extra. In addition, it was their mistake that they quoted us the wrong price, and gave the wrong answer each time we asked them to confirm the price. The next day when we checked out, my fiance expressed his disappointment to the person who assisted us with checkout. The only thing she did was give an insincere apology and kind of giggled about it. She didn't ask if we wanted to speak to a manager or offer any other remedy. In all fairness, we didn't ask to speak to a manager, but by this point we were exhausted, just wanted to get home, and decided to save our comments for this review. Again in fairness, not all of the staff was bad. There were a few really helpful ones whose names we wish we could remember, and we are very grateful to them. Too bad it was limited to just a few people. As a result of this experience, we will never stay at another MO property, and will share (and have been sharing) our poor experience with our friends and family to make sure they don't waste their money here.","San Francisco, California","TracyG1382</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",3,2.0

They both managed to memorize our orders on Day 2 of our trip! Incredible! Our start to each morning was engaging, interesting and always informative as both Robin and Flora addressed our litany of questions about the hotel amenities and must-dos while in Tokyo.

The environment is great-but that is kind of a given here. We liked the location, the lobby area is beautiful, the views are fab and the rooms are lovely-we had a really fine suite with corner views, a beautiful bathroom and dressing room area- ideal. The furnishings in the lounge area and bedroom were a little on the functional side for me personally but that is a matter of personal taste and others will love them.As I say, above is really a given here. What really impressed us about the hotel was the approach of the staff. Again great service is a given here as it should be but we found the staff here went beyond in terms of being proactive, approachable and personable. We had our four year old daughter with us and without exception the staff went out of their way to be friendly and kind to her. This applied right across the hotel from the reception to the restaurants. As another example, we arrived tired after a long flight from the UK but were quickly ushered into the lounge for tea and refreshments. We had great service across our trip to Japan but the service here stands out.We ate dinner in the Italian restaurant and the food was very good, breakfast was excellent. I also used the sauna and bath area which has lovely views. Overall highly recommended.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","je22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",134,5.0

We had plenty of space to put our luggage and the room was very spacious, even though there was three of us (thus, three luggages).We tried the gym which was great, the equipments were new, there were towels, water and fruits available, and there were some weightlifting equipment and some cardio ones and you could also see the fireworks from there. However, they do not have a swimming pool which would have been nice. The problems come firstly with the wifi - in order to connect you had to either because a ""fan of mandating oriental"" or have it charged to your room, but one of my friends who arrived later was told by the reception that she had to pay, and was not informed of the first option. I also had a problem connecting even after becoming a ""fan of Mandarin Oriental"" despite having asked the reception for instructions and followed it to the T, I instead had to pay due to such difficulties. I feel as though given the steep price, it is rather appalling that connecting to the wifi was such a hassle. We had stayed in the Peninsula the night before which was slightly cheaper and we faced no such problems with the wifi and I actually prefer the location of the Peninsula which is near the imperial palace and Ginza. Secondly we went for dinner in one of the restaurants (the pizza bar). Whilst they were considerate in allowing us to order from the pizza bar from the other restaurant as they were fully booked, we had to wait almost 2 hours for our order from the pizza to arrive. Nonetheless, the waitress was wonderful, her english was perfect and her recommendations all proved to be great and gave us complimentary deserts due to the wait. Otherwise the food was very good but not exceptional, and the price was reasonable given the amount we ordered and the fact that we were at the Mandarin with a great view. Lastly the service was at times inconsistent, firstly the problem with the wifi and misinformation noted above regarding that, and whilst the service at checkout was great, it wasn't so at check-in. The lady who checked us in gave us wrong information at times, not only relating to the wifi (e.g. we asked about the Sumida fireworks and a good viewing spot and she told us people reserve their restaurants to view it months in advance even though the fireworks were delayed by one day due to the rain, as such, people who reserve ""months in advance"" must have reserved for the night before), another minor problem is that when asking for some information, the lady who checked us in always referred us to another rather than making enquiries herself which I would expect from a 5 star hotel. Nonetheless, she was polite.Nonetheless, the problems weren't too bad, and the room, as noted above, was wonderful, therefore I am still giving the hotel 4 stars.","Niagara-on-the-Lake, Canada","c1424388</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Niagara-on-the-Lake, Canada</strong>",23,4.0

The view of the room was excellent and I've noticed that through out the stay I didn't hear any noise from rooms next to us or even any noise from outside the room. The gym was basic and of decent size.One great thing about hotel was that almost no tour groups stay here. I'm not sure if its by chance but it was definitely much more quiet compared to other hotels I've stayed in Tokyo. The breakfast included in my room rate was of high quality and they advised that the Japanese set breakfast will take a longer time to prepare and it did not disappoint, well worth the wait. Other hotels with a similar price wasn't as good as the one I had here. Another thing I find a little awkward is that a member of the staff will accompany us down to the first floor. At first I thought it was just coincidence but we noted that every time we took a lift down, a staff will follow us in and hold the elevator doors for us. I guess they are just very observant in a way.Just for the fact that there is less tour groups that are staying at this place, I would gladly pay the premium to stay here again.","Taipei, Taiwan","HamoL27</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Taipei, Taiwan</strong>",0,5.0

We have been travelling to Japan for decades and have stayed in so many different luxury hotels and can safely say the MO is the best one thus far. The staff was always attentive/alert and they quietly anticipated our needs. When we arrived, a concierge staff led us to Reception at the 38th floor and he whispered our family name to the Front Desk staff. I didn't even know he knew which group we were.Weeks prior to our arrival, we had contacted their Concierge to assist us in getting restaurant reservations. We probably exchanged more than 25 emails as they worked really hard to get us the reservations to 4 restaurants we really wanted to try. They replied promptly each time and although I felt we were the ones who were imposing on their time, they were always cordial and nice about the whole thing. At check-in, someone from the Concierge met with us to go through all our restaurant reservations and they had actually printed out an “itinerary” for each dinner with all the details (time, attire, etc.) and a map of each restaurant that we can show the taxi driver. Amazing!The bedrooms and bathrooms were huge for Tokyo! And they had every amenity imaginable...Nespresso machine, a yoga mat, hair brush (not a comb), makeup magnifying mirror beside the vanity table, office supplies, etc. We had sent out 2 shirts for laundry. Later in the day, we received the laundered shirts back and they included a note saying they couldn't get a stain (tiny!) out of one of the shirts and so they didn't charge us for it. The lobby staff (ground floor) were always there to help us get a taxi and they made sure the taxi driver understood where we wanted to go and sometimes they even went as far as making sure the driver input the correct address in his GPS. When it was raining, they immediately ask if we wanted umbrellas. When we said yes, another staff magically appeared in seconds to hand us a couple.Although the location is a business area, there are lots of dining and shopping options. The subway station was directly underneath the hotel and the turnstile for the Ginza Line (which we frequently used) were just a few meters away. Service above and beyond...is really what sets MO-Tokyo apart from the other luxury hotels in the city. The staff really put their hearts and minds into their work and it shows.

From the moment you arrive the excellent staff greet you warmly and with complete politeness and professionalism. Check in was in room and they had on their system when I last stayed and preferences. I was staying in a Mandarin delux room (with a very faint view of Mount Fuji one morning) which is by no means a huge suite but perfectly spacious and actually feels slightly larger than the corner rooms I have had before. All the usual MO touches are there from robes, Yakutas tea and coffee facilities, a huge bath although their new toiletries by Bottega are not as nice as the original Aromatherapy Associates (first world pains). I didn’t eat in the hotel apart from breakfast which was excellent. Perfect croissants and the congee and Japanese specials were excellent. Several well made drinks in the bar on 37 which is a nice place for a chilled drink before dinner or bed. I used the spa on the last day as I always like to and the 50 minute relaxation head and shoulder massage was one of the most effective I’ve ever had in an MO or anywhere. Drifted off a few times. The hotel is also conveniently located about Mitsukoshimae subway station.

The service is beyond my expectation. If you were as lucky as me to check in at evening, the city view in the lobby is so stunning and breath taking. The room design use lots of light color wood combine with dark color large desk , the decoration over the bed and sink in the bathroom. Overall they might not be as luxury as some other top end hotels, but elegant, simple and very Japanese. The location is in the business district. There are so many restaurants and stores within 5 minutes walking radius of the hotel, which people can enjoy all type of japanese food and looking for gifts and souvenirs. Two of my favorites are Naku, the 24/7 open fast food chain. Use machine to order beef bowls etc. The other is Kiya, which sells kitchen tools include the iconic Japanese knives. The oldest High end Luxury department store Mitsukoshi is on the other side of the street. The basement is heaven for all foodies, traditional japanese food, beautiful wagashi, fresh made sashimi, sushi and the ultimate kobe beef which doesn't come cheap. Heading north, about 20 minutes walking to Yodabashi Camera in Akihabara. Heading south, about 15 minutes walking to Tokyo station and another 15 minutes to Ginza shopping area.The concierge is exceptional, help me locate the items I look for within a few hours. I want special thank to the night shift crew Daisuke, Satomi and Kodai. I couldn't sleep due to jet lag during my 4 night stay, so I went to front desk every night and had some very nice and warm chat with them around 3AM. I also went to the bar after they closed. Though they were busy on the paperwork, we still had happy conversation. Overall, Tokyo Mandarin Oriental deserves the reputation of the best service hotel.There are restaurants in the lobby. Sushi Sora is excellent. The standard buffet breakfast is decent which offers large selection of food. But I highly recommend the Oriental Lounge which offers traditional Japanese breakfast set.I could only come up with two drawbacks about Tokyo MO. One is lack of a swimming pool.

We felt like VIP guests throughout our stay.Our hotel room was comfortable and wow, what a view! Our room had plenty of room, comfortable bed, and roomy bathroom. The housekeeping staff did a great job and very courteous even bringing multi pillows for my wife to ensure she had the right one. The hotel had multi restaurants though we did not visit them all, we wanted to mention our experience at the hotel bar and where we had our buffet breakfast each morning. The hotel bar was attentive and made sure we were comfortable though it’s our experience at the breakfast each day that made a big impact. We saw the same servers each morning and by our second day, they knew our likes. Our daily server was off on our last day and even though she was not working, she left a note with the new server of what we ordered each morning. My wife used the hotel spa and had a relaxing and pleasant experience. The hotel concierge desk was outstanding. They went above and upon our expectations each day. They spent time with us to plan out our short trip in Tokyo and make sure we knew our way. They booked two dinners for us and both were great however one was a Michelin Star restaurant which was very difficult to get a reservation. The hotel was situated conveniently above a subway line and walking distance to the Imperial Palace and shopping. The entire hotel staff from the bellhops to management did an outstanding job each day.

I have been a long time ""fan"" of the Mandarin properties and have frequented various properties of theirs around the world including London, Hong Kong, Paris, New York, Geneva, and Las Vegas - which has a gorgeous Mandarin Suite and phenomenal spa by the way. We even had friends warn us about their experience before staying there but we booked anyway thinking, it's the Mandarin - how can it be bad? The cigarette smoke hits your nose the moment you step off the elevator into the lobby. It was so pungent on every floor of the hotel and everywhere else except the gym - which was our only solace from the stench. I was dumbfounded as our room was non-smoking yet it reeked (please see photo of air filter). They had air filters or what seemed to be some sort of air purifiers on the floors but they did not provide any relief. Secondly, the rooms have not been updated since the hotel opened in 2005 (even though it looks like it's from 1995). The wood furniture was damaged and chipped, the black sink had caulk or silicone everywhere as a bandaid repair for whatever damage was underneath. The wallpaper was peeling on one corner and the bed was stiff with thin sheets. We could also hear the people on the floor above our room walking around which I've never experienced before. How thin are the floors? Seriously, this room felt so gross that we didn't want to spend any time in the room when normally I revel in lounging around and ordering room service in a 5 star hotel. The only saving grace was that the food at the restaurant was good, although the staff was not attentive. I'm sorry to say that this experience has deterred me from future stays at other Mandarin properties because of the mere fact that they would even operate this hotel under their prestigious brand. I normally wouldn't make a fuss but the fact that the hotel still charged an arm and a leg for a horrible room but I guess since other patrons are willing to overlook normal amenities then I guess they do not have to improve or update in any way. We traveled around Japan for a week staying at the Shangri-la, Four Seasons Kyoto, Ritz Kyoto and all of them by far surpassed this hotel. The management can look up my previous stays at their other properties to verify.","Los Angeles, California","Larina C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",9,1.0

Reception was on 38th floor. Our room was on 31st floor. To leave our room and exit the hotel, we had to take the elevator from the 31st floor to the 38th, walk about 50 meters through the reception area and then take another elevator to street level.Location of hotel. We took taxis everywhere we went. To Asakusa and Skytree tower cost about 1500 yen. To Disney Sea cost 6500 yen. To Kabukiza Theatre cost 1200 yen. Hotel to Shinkansen station was also 1200 yen. Obviously, prices vary depending on the traffic and road works.Check-in good. Room ready at 1pm. Helpful information from Concierge about places to visit in the vicinity and how to get there. We were told that there was a hop-on-hop-off bus service which passed close to the hotel every 20 minutes. We found the bus stop, but no buses arrived. It seems that that service does not operate in the winter months.Room:One of the most pleasant hotel rooms we have stayed in worldwide!! Great view, even Mount Fuji on a clear day. Large windows. Curtains providing complete blackout. Also, a blind for privacy.Single hand basin in bathroom. Large bath and separate shower area. Dark Marble floors in bath area. TV in bathroom and sound bedroom from TV..Most of the floor area was a light wood with carpet around the beds. Much of the wooden floor area was badly marked probably from guests dragging heavy bags across the floor. Also damaged by heals.Light, curtains and privacy controls on small bedside console. 8 switches, several with dual function. Not easy to select the desired button especially at night..Large TV with external sound system. Many foreign channels.WiFi – we were told was not included, but we did not receive an extra charge. Probably a misunderstanding.Nespresso machine and kettle filled with filtered water. Tea and coffee. Fridge with minibar.Large writing desk with 2 office style chairs. 2 single beds. Large, slightly firm for our taste. We slept well (apart from the noise from the room above).Noise from people walking in the room above. It woke us at 5am on our first morning. Quite loud. Also, resonant mechanical noise at times, maybe from a water pump?A man was admitted to the breakfast room (having apparently just come from the fitness room) wearing shorts and carrying a towel. My wife and I (and judging from the reaction of Japanese guests) would have preferred if the person on reception had refused the man entry to the breakfast room until he was at least wearing trousers. Sometimes Japanese should be a little less tolerant of westerners who disrespect their culture and the other hotel guests.Apart from self-service breakfast, we did not eat at the hotel restaurants. In the lower floors of the hotel and across the road from the hotel there are several buildings with every kind of cuisine you can imagine.Pleasant lounge area to relax with live music on 37th floor.","Nagoya, Japan","Aeroboffin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nagoya, Japan</strong>",52,5.0

Their airport pick-up also worked well.The only negative was the hotel concierge which we contact via e-mail a number of times before our stay. Each time we followed up on restaurant reservations or the airport pick up they initially acted like we were starting from scratch until we reminded them we had already enquired or given them our flight info. They need a better system for tracking these things.

To say we were jetlagged would be an understatement. What a welcome relief it was to arrive at the Mandarin Oriental. Check in was smooth and seamless with beautiful views of the city. We were escorted to our rooms immediately, one being a corner room and the other being a deluxe city view room with double queen beds. The rooms weren't adjoining but shared a small private entry hallway which was very convenient. I didn't make it to dinner however my family members said the food was delicious at the Italian restaurant located in the hotel. I took advantage of the pillow menu located in the room and was brought a body pillow within 5 minutes of calling in the request. The breakfast spread was absolutely wonderful and had a variety of freshly squeezed juices, made to order eggs, meats, cheeses, fruit, pastries, in addition to an array of traditional Japanese breakfast options. A member of the hotel staff escorted us to the train station and helped us with our bags so we made it onto the bullet train on time. I don't think we would have made it without his help and were truly impressed with his and the hotel's customer service during our stay.

Several exceptional instances include:• The room service team was extremely accommodating, customizing the menu to our needs and preferences. All of our orders were delivered fresh and hot, and always with a smile. Dining in was such a treat that despite the great temptations outside the hotel, we were often contented with dining in the comforts of our suite.• The staff and cuisine at K’shiki are exceptional. We hosted a dinner one night and could not have asked for better service and attention (despite having restless children at the table). The pizza was one of the best that I have ever tasted – better than even the “original” in Italy (and New York!). Breakfast was served efficiently and again our off-menu requests were accommodated without any fuss. The vibe was casual but the service and food were up there with the best establishments.• We were extremely thrilled with the special treats that we received everyday – be it a carefully curated souvenir from the local craftsmen or a creatively concocted dessert for the children (a pizza made of fruit, tic-tac-toe game made of cookies and chocolate, fruit parfait made to resemble a dolphin … what works of art!). This really goes a long way towards providing us with a personal and unforgettable experience – and not just another run-of-the-mill “5-star hotel stay”. In this day of customized luxury, I must compliment you for being ahead of the game.• Finally, I'd like to compliment the senior team for taking such a hands-on approach to managing the property. We met the director and assistant director of rooms, assistant director of F&B, restaurant manager also had the privilege of meeting the GM during our brief stay. The attention to detail and lead-from-the-front ethos shone through and go a long way to explain why in my opinion this is one of the best “home away from home” that one can experience. This stay has definitely cemented my faith of and loyalty to the MO brand, and unfortunately I will now measure all other hotels against this very high benchmark which means a high probability of disappointment!

Bathroom with la Bottega amenities was amazing. After check-in, I had a complimentary green tea service in the room and a prayer rug, what a detail this was because they knew I was coming from a muslim country. Mandarin Bar serving super cocktails was beautiful The breakfast with views was buffet style with high quality ingredients and with some japanese cheeses I had never tasted before. The spa was amazing with a nice small pool type jacuzzi and sauna facing Shinjuku. In this hotel every coin had amazing views even the restroom in the lobby area.

The service was excellent-the brand speaks for itself. When it comes to MO, everyone expects for perfection and that's exactly what we got. The check in was done in the room without having to wait at the lobby. They had 2 options for breakfast at K'shiki and Oriental lounge. We ended up having breakfast at K'shiki for both days as it offers an array of buffet as compared to Oriental lounge which serves ala-carte. Be sure to try their Signature crab egg Benedict/classic. It was to die for, I had them both days. The room was gorgeous and loved the bathroom and bathtub. Managed to spend sometime indulging the beautiful bathtub with Bottega Veneta amenities. Do check out the Mandarin Bar in the evening which overlooks the beautiful city skyline-a great spot to have a drink and unwind after a Long day. It's quite convenient to the train station, 10-minutes walk away and if you would like to get more adventurous it's about 20minutes walk to Ginza area, we walked both the nights to Ginza which was a great way to explore the surroundings and there are various eateries around the vicinity which will get you tempted to try.

We travel all over the world and only stay at top level hotels and resorts. I can say with confidence that the Mandarin Tokyo is not one of them. After checking into the room, my wife wanted to take a nap as we had taken a 13 hour flight to get to Tokyo. We were asked when we wanted turndown service and we had requested 7PM for each evening. I went out for a walk and housekeeping came into the room without knocking and proceeded to start the turndown service while my wife was sleeping in bed around 5PM. She woke up and thought I had come home from my walk and was shocked to see a stranger standing in our room. I reported the incident and someone did come to the room to apologize but this should never happen in any hotel. Today, we left our room at 1230PM and asked to have the room cleaned as soon as possible as we had slept in this morning. We arrived back after 4PM and housekeeping was just walking into the room. We wanted to shower but we didn't have clean towels or a clean room. I don't understand how this lapse of service could happen at any good property let alone a Mandarin.We also had issues at the breakfast buffet. Most of the hot food on the buffet was cold and many of the pots holding the items were left empty for a period of time. We also had dirty plates left on our table throughout the meal despite having asked to have them removed.Last but not least, the concierge service has not been good. We emailed the concierge in advance of our trip asking for help with restaurant reservations. Five days have passed since our first email and they were only able to secure one reservation for us. We also had several conversations with the concierge to discuss the restaurants and we had an issue with a language barrier earlier today and they also gave us a horrible recommendation for lunch where we had to leave the restaurant because the smell was so bad.This is not a good start to our wedding anniversary trip and I will not be returning or recommending the Mandarin Tokyo to my colleagues or friends.","Houston, Texas","Std63nyc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",115,2.0

It is a short taxi ride from Tokyo station. I could not give the hotel 5 stars, but if I could, I would have given them 3.5 stars. FIRST IMPRESSION - On arrival, we took the elevator to the 38th floor hotel lobby. As soon as we walked out of the elevators, we could smell cigarette smoke. The Mandarin bar mostly consists of smoking tables and is located one floor down from the lobby, connected by stairs, so the smoke persists in drifting upwards to the lobby. Not a pleasant welcome at all. The lobby also can be very busy as there are many sofas and chairs, so you never feel this is an ""exclusive"" hotel. LOCATION - Nihonbashi is more a commercial district than a tourist district. There are many restaurants nearby in Coredo, but most of them do not have English menus (not even photos), and if they do, the menu is very limited. The hotel is a short walk from the Mitsukoshimae station which is very convenient if as services on both the Ginza and Hanzōmon Lines. SERVICEEvery staff member at this hotel goes the extra mile for guests. They call you by name, and are always one step ahead. This is the only thing I cannot fault this hotel for. RESTAURANTSThe hotel has many small restaurants. We dined at 3 of them during our stay. Sushi Sora was an amazing experience. We were disappointed with the breakfast at K'shiki, as the buffet was very small and crowded, and the restaurant has poor sound insulation, which means it is very noisy. We just didn't think what was offered in the breakfast buffet was anything outstanding for MO. Next morning we went to the Oriental Lounge for their set Western and Japanese breakfast, and although it was a much more quieter experience, the Western breakfast was lacking in presentation and taste. Room Service is also very thoughtful as they replaced a drink that had been spilled. BARThe hotel seems to run its F&B outlets mostly for non-hotel guests and such is the case for the bar. 70% of the bar tables are for smokers. Non-smoking tables are near the windows but behind the live band, so you don't hear the music. If you want to listen to the music, you have to sit in the smoking area. The service here was very good though and again, cannot be faulted.SPALocated on the 37th floor, the spa has great views from the Heat and Water facilities. However, most of the treatment rooms are small and do not have windows. The treatments we had were good but not worth the price charged.ROOMSWe would not recommend the corner rooms as they have an odd layout. The views and layout of the deluxe rooms are much better, but the bathroom is not as nice. We were bit disappointed the toilet did not even have a dryer. If you pay over 50,000Yen for a room a night, you would expect a better Japanese toilet with automatic open/close and dryer. Overall, even though the service was top notch, we could not rate the MO with 5 stars.

Special thanks to Ms Fiona Villa, Front Desk Assistant Manager who ensured that my stay would be exceptional. It's this kind of attention that encourages my continued loyalty to the MO Group. It is appreciated that my loyalty with the various MO properties is recognised; where one may get an enhanced service. However, as with the many hotel loyalty programs notably the World of Hyatt, SPG & Hilton Honors, this system will further enhance the transparency & capture ones patronage with the group to obtain instant recognition. The rooms were spacious and beautifully appointed. However, perhaps there were some interior touches that need to be updated. The bathroom was a little too small where 2 basins would have been more convenient. And would love to have had a Japanese wooden tub to differentiate from the other MOs which would have complimented the Japanese style WC. The bathroom amenities were a joy, Bottega Veneta toiletries and even the fine design details of the cotton swabs, where those of my generation & culture would appreciate. In conclusion I would definitely recommend this hotel where the software & hardware were impeccable & where I look forward to my next stay at the MO Tokyo.

Unfortunately, we have had a very unpleasant stay due to the heavy smoke in the lobby area. We have stayed in numerous MO hotels around the world (most recently last summer in Bangkok) and luxury hotel chains such as the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Peninsula, Aman, etc in dozens of countries around the world (many developing countries as well) and we have NEVER experienced such disgusting smoke smell in the common areas of a hotel. We have not been able to enjoy any of this hotel because of the smoke smell. Just in the past hour, we ordered up room service instead of eating in one of the many restaurants in the lobby areas. It is difficult to use the concierge services because they are located in the smoke-filled lobby area. Even in the breakfast area, we have to sit in the very back of the restaurant to avoid the smoke emanating from the lobby.We have spoken to the lovely managers at the desk and they said that they have heard this complaint numerous times from hotels guests and have reported it to senior management but they report that their concerns fall on deaf ears.We only go to and from our rooms to the entrance/exit of the hotel and have not spent any other time on the hotel property because of the smoke smell. One of the members of our family has asthma and her symptoms have worsened since arriving at this hotel.

Its position at the top of these rankings is earned and then some. The location, the service, the rooms, the amenities: they are all top notch, and you will want for nothing. My main piece of advice is to go ahead and book the Mandarin if it’s in your price range (and, even if it wouldn’t normally be in your price range, you should consider making the splurge anyway), but if you want to know why, read on for copious amounts of detail about our stay. I’m not kidding either: this is going to be really long, and this first paragraph sums it up pretty accurately, so if you want to stop here I don’t blame you.  This review, like all of my hotel reviews, must start with a discussion of the Mandarin’s location, which is essentially in central Tokyo. Specifically, it’s in the Nihombashi neighborhood, which is more or less directly north of Tokyo Station. (The hotel is walkable from Tokyo Station, but if you take the Narita Express in from the airport and you’re laden with luggage a taxi will be easier; our ride cost just over 1000 yen.) The immediate area is definitely more business-oriented than other parts of Tokyo; it seemed like everyone walking around during the day was in a suit (we were there for three weekdays), and this is certainly not where you want to be if nightlife is your thing. The surroundings are far from dead, however. There are plenty of restaurants, bakeries, and coffee places nearby, not to mention a Family Mart convenience store about a block and a half from the Mandarin’s entrance. (Aside #1: once you start looking for them you’ll see either a Family Mart, a 7-Eleven, or a Lawson convenience store on practically every other block in Tokyo, which is great for many reasons but mainly because they all have ATMs that accept foreign cards.) The enormous main branch of the Mitsukoshi department store chain sits adjacent to the Mandarin and there are numerous other stores in the vicinity as well. Unless it’s a nightclub you’re looking for, you'll find whatever you need in close proximity. And then there’s the public transportation aspect. The skyscraper that the Mandarin can be found in is directly connected to the Mitsukoshimae station of the Tokyo Metro where trains on the Ginza Line and the Hanzomon Line stop. This means that you’re no more than one transfer away from pretty much any destination in Tokyo, and all without even having to go outside. (Two caveats: 1) The exit from the station that leads into the Mandarin’s building closes at 8:00 pm, thus forcing you to take one of two nearby exits and enter the hotel from the outside after that hour. Not a huge deal, but it could be frustrating if it’s cold or raining. 2) Though part of the same station, the Ginza Line platforms are much closer to the hotel than those of the Hanzomon Line. I’m talking like 500 meters closer (there are signs indicating such information), which is not an insignificant distance. Again, not a huge deal, but by the end of the stay I tried to plot journeys that started/ended on the Ginza Line.)  The overall convenience of essentially being on top of the Metro cannot be overstated. I’m a seasoned public transportation user, both at home in Chicago and when we travel, and for my money Tokyo tops any list of systems for efficiency, speed, and value. We rode all over the city at all hours of the day and I am not exaggerating when I say that the longest we ever waited for a train was about four minutes. The trains were never overcrowded (even during rush hour), seats were comfortable, straps were plentiful for standing riders, signage and announcements were in both Japanese and English, most lines had video monitors with helpful information, maps were abundant, and to top it all off there was free wifi. (Needless to say, the only cabs we took were the one from Tokyo Station to the hotel and then from the hotel to Haneda Airport when we left.) There are many fare-paying options for the Metro, but forget all the others and get yourself a Pasmo smartcard from a machine, as the fares will be automatically deducted from the balance based on the distance traveled. They’re easily added to with cash and can even be used at most of the thousands of vending machines you will see all over Tokyo. (Aside #2: cash plays a surprisingly large role in many transactions, and to a certain extent it’s easier to just get more from one of the aforementioned ATMs than it is to try to use a credit card in many places. And if you get tired of carrying them around, the yen coins you’ll end up with in change can simply be used in one of said vending machines for a refreshing beverage.)  (Aside #3: the proximity of the Mandarin to the Metro must be contrasted with the utter lack of similar proximity enjoyed by the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku, which a certain movie makes look like an appealing hotel option. And it might very well be, at least until you go there in person (we visited the New York Bar depicted in said movie) and realize that it is far removed from Shinjuku Station, which can only be reached by either a 15-20 minute walk through desolate, windswept plazas that are unfriendly to pedestrians, or a short bus/taxi ride. Not to knock a hotel we didn’t stay at, but if you care at all about such things, your time in Tokyo is too valuable to stay somewhere that far away from the Metro.) Enough preliminaries, it’s time to discuss the hotel itself. My discussion actually begins about three weeks before our stay when I sent an email to the general email address for the Mandarin asking three distinctly disparate questions. Within 24 hours I had received a response that indicated that each of the three parts of the hotel in question (spa, concierge, and restaurant reservations) had been informed of my inquiries and would respond individually. And so they did: I booked a spa appointment for my wife and was also able to determine that I didn’t need to make a reservation for one of the Mandarin’s restaurants for the night of our arrival because it was a Sunday. Special mention must be made of the assistance of the concierge, mostly through email correspondence, who went above and beyond in their attempts to make restaurant reservations. I initially emailed to ask if they could get us into a Michelin three-star restaurant that I had already called myself and learned was full. Alas, the concierge was unsuccessful, as they also were in regards to my request for a reservation at a second three-star establishment (aside #4: if you want to dine at a two- or three-star Michelin restaurant in Tokyo, of which there is no shortage, give the concierge a little more notice than the two weeks I did and they can probably make it happen). However, as an alternative, the concierge was able to recommend and book us a counter spot at a one-star sushi restaurant in Ginza and then also book us a counter spot at a different Ginza restaurant known for its Kobe beef. We arrived after our twelve-hour flight at about 6:00 p.m. on Sunday evening in the aforementioned taxi from Tokyo Station. As soon as our taxi was spotted pulling into the enormous porte-cochere a small army of hotel staff assembled to greet us. Our luggage was removed from the trunk and was on its way to our room before I even finished paying the driver. We were greeted by name (I still don’t know how they knew exactly who we were; they did have our flight info but we had landed about three hours prior) and offered a welcome beverage before we had even passed through the automatic doors. Our greeter walked us to the elevators, asked how our flight was, and accompanied us to the front desk where we were swiftly handed over to the person who would check us in. The preferences that I had noted upon booking the room (higher floor and away from the elevators) were both specifically noted and the entire process was extremely courteous and efficient. Once the formalities were completed, we were personally escorted to our room where we were reunited with our luggage and given fruit and tea to welcome us. This staff member asked us if we needed anything else and we noted that we wanted to eat dinner in the hotel and wondered if we needed a reservation. Once we had decided on Sense, the Cantonese restaurant, this person told us she would make the booking and called us within about two minutes after leaving to inform us that it had been made for our desired time of 7:00 p.m. (It turned out that Sense wasn’t full and we probably didn’t need a reservation at all, but the willingness to accommodate us, and to do so expeditiously, just speaks to the comprehensive service that a guest receives.)  Before I get to the room I must briefly describe the lobbies. The lobby on the ground floor is tastefully and beautifully appointed and is quite large compared to other hotels that are in skyscrapers. It also has coffee, tea, and bottles of water available for guests early in the morning. The door to the lobby of the office building is here, which is the way to the Metro station, though it gets locked at an unknown time. There are three elevators that whisk you to the main lobby on the 38th floor. The main lobby, also tastefully and beautifully appointed, is notable first for the pleasant scent that greets you as soon as you step off the elevator; I never did put my finger on its source but I also never failed to notice it. The standard chairs and sofas were in the middle with the front desk and concierge desk off to one side and a staircase down to the 37th floor on the opposite side. Oh, and the views are commanding: a view of the Tokyo Skytree to the northeast behind the front desk, and a view of the rest of Tokyo and Mt. Fuji (on a clear day) to the southwest behind the staircase. The main bar and most of the restaurants are down on the 37th floor, but we didn’t spend very much time down there. We booked a Mandarin Grand Room and were given 3508, which was indeed far from the elevators (though the halls are so quiet I can’t imagine the distance would make much of a difference). The room was large, spacious, and faced southwest with a commanding view of other skyscrapers, trains coming in and out of Tokyo Station, and the rest of Tokyo. (Though the room is advertised as having views of Mt. Fuji, it should be noted that Mt. Fuji is approximately 60 miles away and thus requires an nearly perfectly clear day to be seen from the room. Though there were sunny days during our stay, each day it was a bit hazy off in the distance, and aside from a brief glimpse just before sunset on the first night we arrived, we never did get to enjoy the view of Mt. Fuji.) Immediately inside the front door was the closet area with a pass-through locker of sorts which allows hotel staff to deliver items, or vice versa, without having to knock on the door (if you’ve ever stayed at an all-inclusive resort in the Caribbean you know what I’m talking about). This is where our daily newspaper was found each morning, and folded nicely in a protective sleeve at that. (Again, it’s the attention to detail that sets the Mandarin apart.)  The bathroom was behind the entry area and it might be the best I’ve ever seen in a hotel room. It was spacious with one sink and ample counter space, a separate room for the toilet (with phone, natch), a walled-off shower without a door, and a large soaking tub. There was a television on the wall with its own remote and a ceiling-mounted speaker for its audio (that is, if you could figure out how to operate it, which I could not). Both long walls of the bathroom had windows looking into the other parts of the room, but both sets of windows had blinds that could be drawn for privacy, and there was a pocket door to completely close everything off. A magnified mirror was on the vanity. Almost every single beauty and/or grooming item was provided, from the obvious shampoo/conditioner/body wash/lotion to both men’s and women’s razors, shaving cream, a toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, two kinds of bath salts, and even a foldable hairbrush. The shower had three components: a rainshower in the ceiling, a regular showerhead on the wall, and a detachable sprayer on the opposite wall. Two could be used simultaneously, but not all three. There was no door to the shower area but the tile was connected to that in front of the tub and thus stray water was kept to a minimum. Robes were provided and there was an ample supply of large, sufficiently fluffy towels. We never did use the tub so that’s about the only bathroom element I cannot comment on, but overall it receives very high marks. The bed was behind the bathroom with the aforementioned floor-to-ceiling windows at the far end. It was a king-size bed with a small bench of sorts at the foot and bedside counters (there were two levels) flanking each side. Both electrical outlets and USB ports were provided on each side. Slippers were also found on each side of the bed. There was an extensive pillow menu provided but the ones on the bed were deemed to be sufficient. Other furniture included a chair, a round ottoman, a chaise lounge, and a desk. The flat-screen TV was large (I would guess 42” but it might have been closer to 50”) with various Japanese and English language channels; the setup was a little confusing in that a specific button on the remote had to be pressed to access the HD channels, but once I figured that out it was smooth sailing. Climate control was via a wall-mounted panel and both heating and cooling were perfectly adequate. The lights were a bit wonky in that they were controlled by various panels located around the room but didn’t seem to be perfectly responsive to our selections, sometimes requiring multiple presses before the desired effect was reached (the bathroom lights were the most temperamental in this department). This was hardly a major problem, however, and with sunrise at about 5:00 a.m. when we were there, artificial lighting wasn’t needed very much anyway. Wifi worked for our phones and my iPad without any problems but was free only because I registered online with Mandarin first; while I quibble with any luxury hotel brand not providing free wifi as a matter of course, especially considering what you pay to get a room in the first place, creating a profile is not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. As expected, service was a highlight. One example was our request for an iron and ironing board (it was somewhat surprisingly not in the room already); I called before we headed out for the day to ask if it could be brought when housekeeping came later. Housekeeping immediately offered to bring it right away before I assured them that there was no rush. Upon our return later that evening the board was unfolded with a unplugged iron ready to go on top of it. Another example was my request for a prearranged taxi to take us to Haneda upon our checkout the next day. I called before the concierge was officially available but the front desk staff didn’t make me leave a message or tell me to call back. They effortlessly handled the arrangements, and a confirmation letter was left for us in our room for when we returned. As for the spa, my wife had a massage the morning following our arrival and she described it as very good. She also noted that the service was gracious. The spa itself opens at 9:00 a.m. to the public but starting at (I think) 6:00 a.m. the gender specific “heat and water experiences” are open to hotel guests only. I’ve never been a huge user of spa offerings but I enjoyed these amenities on two different mornings. There were two separate warm water baths with jets, an amethyst crystal steam room, and a dry sauna with commanding views (the men’s was to the Mt. Fuji side; my wife says she enjoyed the bath with the view to the northeast). Multiple shower stalls were found in this area with shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispensers mounted to the wall of each stall. Towels were in ample supply. There were two locker areas and all lockers had the computerized locks that allowed you to set your own combination. All toiletries were provided for post-shower needs and bottles of water could be found in multiple locations. The best part was that I saw a grand total of two other men during my mornings; this may have been a function of being there before 7:00 a.m., but it certainly wasn’t crowded at all.  Our checkout was early in the morning but was handled effortlessly. A bellman arrived to collect our luggage maybe three minutes after I made the call and they went ahead and placed it in the trunk of our waiting prearranged taxi. Water, coffee, and fruit were offered and accepted before we got in the cab. Flawless execution from start to finish.  If you’ve made it this far, thank you for staying with me. I could easily continue with more raves but 3000+ words already is probably sufficient. Seriously, if you’re even in the ballpark of being able to afford to stay here, just do it. Tokyo isn’t exactly a bargain travelers’ destination in the first place (e.g., we dropped over $300 each on two different meals) and if you’re expending the time and money to fly across the Pacific (or Asia, for my European readers) to get there, you might as well be rewarded for your efforts once you arrive. This might be the best hotel in the world. At the very least, it’s the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in.","Chicago, Illinois","mburtz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",77,5.0

What surprised me most is that I had previously stayed earlier in the week at a Ritz Carlton (Kyoto) and expected their world renown service to be tops. I was wrong - Mandarin clearly led the service excellence for the following reasons:During a bar visit, my husband and I mentioned that we were interested in trying different saki with our server. We were having an exploratory conversation with the server, when we then moved on to our next stop in the evening. Later that night, we had a letter in our room from the concierge following up on our request from that discussion. It is truly incredible to me that in the fast paced world of hospitality when an employee makes a point to follow up on such a request. Secondly, when we arrived, our room had not been quite finished for our check in (we needed to wait about 20 min). We were treated to a tea break in their beautiful lobby, overlooking the city (at their expense). Next, we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. This hotel truly did a great job remembering this - and acknowledged it with several special treats throughout, as well as a lovely parting gift of green MatchaLastly - the concierge truly aims to please - they offered up many delightful suggestions and made our holiday that much special. There was one opportunity for development here - we wanted to see the Sumo practice, and evidently this training is difficult to get tickets to see. It would have been better if the concierge had told us that and really prioritised that activity and we would have worked the other sight-seeing around it.Recommendation to future guests: Do take advantage of the concierge services, they know their stuff. Also, for a special night out go to the Sora Sushi and amazed at the chef's cutting and preparation skills!Recommendation to hotel management: Do ask your concierge to help prioritise the more difficult to book / high demand activities first, to avoid disappointment.","Basel, Switzerland","Lori P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Basel, Switzerland</strong>",252,5.0

After arriving at the ground floor entrance, we were warmly met by hotel staff who quickly unloaded our luggage and ushered us to the 38th floor where the hotel reception was located. Since it was ""Golden week"" in Japan, the hotel was very busy and our room was not ready, even though we arrived at 2pm. We were courteously escorted to the lounge on 37th floor, where we had coffee and a lght meal. After about an hour, a senior (and distinguished gentleman) staff member came to look for us, to bring us to our room - to our pleasant surprise, we had been upgraded to a corner suite on the 30th floor (perhaps because we had reserved our room through the Visa Luxury Hotel program), The suite was very spacious and bright, with superb views over the city - including Mount Fuji in the distance ! The decor was contemporary and in the signature colours of Mandarin Oriental. All the amenities, fittings, and appliances were modern - Nespresso machine, flat-screen large TV's, tall wireless speakers - wow ! The bedroom and bathroom did not disappoint either - super-comfortable bed with a large number of pillow choices; and the bathroom was very large, with an open, walk-in shower area (with 3 types of shower-heads), adjacent to a deep soaking bathtub. Colours were in grey black stone, and cedar wood-beige colour contrasts. The amenities included everything you can think of (Bottega soap and gels !) My wife could have stayed inside the whole evening ! We had superb sleep that night, in the very quiet room (Couldn't hear other guests, even though the hotel had full occupancy!). However it was very crowded in the breakfast area on the 38th floor, and we had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. Nevertheless, the service staff and attitude was execellent, even though they were so busy. Breakfast was buffet-style, with a decent range of interesting Japanese and Western food, juices, etc. After our morning outing, we checked out at 2pm - very prompt collection of our luggage, check-out, and then transfer to a taxi to the airport (all within 15 minutes !) Few negatives about the hotel - wi-fi charges are rather high; similarly laundry and pressing (no iron in the room). Food and beverage costs also expensive, but high quality. But there are many good restaurants within short walking distance. Many positives - very elegant atmosphere and luxurious furnishings and decor throughout the hotel, and superb staff attitudes and service quality, from the bell service to housekeeping, front desk and restaurants.

My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in October 2016 on the Japan leg of our honeymoon and had very high expectations given the reputation. Luckily, the hotel didn't disappoint. The location is great - located in the business district so not a lot to do in the immediate area, but it's very close to Tokyo station and had direct access to Mitsukoshi-mae station in the basement, making it a great base from which to explore this amazing city.Our room was stunning, had an incredible view of the Tokyo skyline, amazing bathroom and unbelievable amenities - truly everything you could think of, kettle refilled every day, binoculars, even the pencil sharpener in the stationary drawer was awesome. The care and attention that's gone into the rooms is really unbelievable. The hotel itself is gorgeous, we loved the classy and modern decor. The view from the lobby is to die for and leads you to the warmest and most helpful concierge team I've ever encountered. They went above and beyond in every aspect. The food and beverage services at the hotel are top class, from breakfast, the pizza bar, to cocktails in the evening, the food and drinks were excellent and the staff were even better. Everyone seemed to know we were on honeymoon, gave us their warm wishes and topped it off with lovely touches like complimentary drinks, fruit, cake, great seats with great views, we really were treated so well.There was a bit of confusion with what was included in the package we had reserved, down to a miscommunication between the agency we had used and the hotel, but management handled this professionally and courteously. Once they had identified the issue, they gave us complimentary breakfast (probably the best breakfast buffet I've ever seen) and a heap of goodies and information on Kyoto which was our next destination.We also stayed three nights at the RItz Carlton but we absolutely preferred the Mandarin Oriental. It comes with a hefty price tag but in my opinion is truly in a class of its own.",London,"RanjiJ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",109,5.0

I am a clean freak and the bathroom is probably one of the most important factors for me. The bathtub - I loved and in general the shower, bathtub etc was pretty impressive and clean. The views are beautiful especially sunrise and night views. You get a good birds eye view of Tokyo. You can the famous Yokohama Ferris wheel! The stay was comfortable and pleasant.

I had such a great time that I can't wait to return. I have always gone to Tokyo for business and never really got to explore the city so this short 4 day trip accompanying my husband for his business was a rarity for me.  When planning my two week trip to Asia and also the first time taking my 8 month old on an International trip, I checked TripAdvisor to see where we should stay. And am I glad I chose the Mandarin.  The Mandarin lobby has an incredible view of the city. It is worth going there for dinner or drinks just to see the view. The hotel lobby is typical of many Asia hotels where the lobby is high above and rooms are often below. When we entered our room, both my husband and I were shocked by how baby proofed the room was. The staff had baby proofed all the corners so that my son would not get hurt. Plus they had every baby amenity that you can ask! I had contacted the hotel ahead to ask for sterilizer, crib, humidifier but when I arrived there was more! They even had a changing table, bath tub, bottle warmer, and diaper pail for him! This is THE place to stay if you are traveling with a baby. I wish all hotels we travel to are like this.  The room itself was spacious and the furnishing was very traditional. I would say the rooms are nice but probably need a update soon to keep up with the times.  Breakfast every day was great. Incredible selection of food. The kitchen made my son applesauce daily. We didn't even have to ask for it a second day. Since there were 5 of us traveling together, they placed us in the same private dining area daily.  Concierge service was great and they made sure all the restaurants I booked were baby friendly. That was another thing that really surprised me about Tokyo restaurants. I took my son to a lot of high end restaurants this trip and they all allowed babies. One even had a bassinet in the tatami room! Will have to write a review on that one!  Overall, great hotel and incredible staff. Definitely keeps with the Mandarin Oriental brand. Area is conveniently located for business travelers but also quiet and walkable to main shopping area by Tokyo station. Subway is right below hotel so very convenient.

He got us into all 4 michillian star restaurants, he even went to the train station to get us tickets so we didn't have to. I honestly can't say enough about him he's the definition of kindness and dedication to service. The bar staff was INCREDIBLE especially Sarah from Germany she was best!! All the staff knew our names before we walked in how we wanted our drinks and even our reserved spot every day. Their attention to detail is bar none! We are officially spoiled and now nothing will be of our standard again. The breakfast staff was perfection they knew our drink orders and egg orders before we could even put our napkins on our lap!!

The location is great of course but the service is what really makes a great hotel. You are only 1k away from the Imperial Palace, which is a great place for a run. I had a box of collaterals delivered to the hotel prior to my arrival. I did find the box in my room upon arrival, but for the first time ever, I also found a pair of scissors next to it! No need to battle with a pen, a key or the bottle opener to open the box! I travel a lot and this is the first time I experienced such an attention to detail.Next day I went to the front desk to ask for directions for the subway. Two things happened: first when the front desk clerk saw me arrive, she steeped out from behind the desk and came towards me rather than just wait. Then she escorted me ALL THE WAY to the subway station and helped me buy a day pass on the machines.The room had a great view and the breakfast was fantastic.Definitely one of the best Mandarin I have aver been to and one do the best hotel, period.I will be back!",,Greg B,7,5.0

What swayed me to choose this hotel were really good reviews, but we were disappointed from the check in. The lady at the Front Desk was not very welcoming (I was surprised you can get it in Japan in a 5 star hotel). In addition to her rather cold demeanour, when we inquired about the spa, she said we have to pay for it or go in either really early (smth like 8 am, which would not work for us due to jet leg). As we were staying on my husband´s birthday I thought she would give us an exception and treat us on his special day. Unfortunately, she was very stubborn and treated us like any regular guest disregarding the special occasion. She said we could pay extra to enter, but the room rate was very high and it just did not feel right to pay more to enter the spa. So we said we would think about it. Once we entered the room there was another disappointment. It was all clean and fine, but the style was somewhat outdated for a sleek 5 star Tokyo hotel. We stayed in the Palace Hotel, Shangri La, Peninsula and Four Seasons and the decor of all these hotels seemed a lot fresher and more modern.In the end we left after 1 night and went back to Palace Hotel.I am probably too harsh with my review and probably the service from many staff members is impeccable as you get in Japan, unfortunately, our experience was different and so I could not resonate with the other good reviews of this hotel.

He's stationed at Yokosuka Naval Base. It also happened to be my wife's birthday. We had booked a standard room w/roll-away for our son. After traveling from Yokosuka we arrived about 12:30pm and decided to check-in and just leave our bags so we could see parts of the city. The staff at the front desk was highly efficient, warm and friendly. They suggested that if we would like to have a seat in the lounge, they'd have a room ready for us shortly. Also, anything we wanted to eat or drink would be ""on the house"" due to the short wait. Wow - didn't see this coming! Sure enough, after about 20 minutes one of the front desk staff came escorted us to our room. And by the way, they mentioned that the Mandarin had upgraded us to a full suit with their compliments! Wow #2! When we arrived at the 34th floor suite we were blown away. It was the size of the entire first floor of our home in the US. Two large rooms, artwork in niches, 2 baths, beautiful view of Mt. Fuji and the Tokyo skyline. Words can't describe it, really. Tokyo is expensive. So, I knew this suite must be in the thousands per night. But it's no wonder this particular hotel is rated so highly. Well, we still had some of Tokyo to see, so off we went for some chopping, site seeing, and eventually dinner. When we returned to the Mandarin we were greeted by a special desert delivered to our suite in honor of my wife's birthday. We briefly mentioned it at check-in as part of why we chose the Mandarin. On the coffee table were 3 beautiful glass covered strawberry shortcakes and a written card wishing my wife a wonderful birthday - signed by everyone on the front desk staff! Wow #3! We've traveled quite a bit in Europe. But this was our first 10 day trip to Japan. And this night at the Mandarin tops them all. We could not have been more delighted with the venue and friendly, ""over-the-top"" staff. I asked for a feather pillow at check-in. We got 3! And it would be easy to list all the other pluses about this hotel. Our stay, for one night only, was superb. But, we had a bullet train to catch to Kyoto.

Let me start with the positives:- The common areas definitely have that 'wow factor'- While the breakfast spread is limited compared to other 5* hotels I've stayed at in Asia, everything is very well executed and the view of Mount Fuji (on a clear day) from the breakfast table is a great experience.- The view from the sauna overlooking the city at sunrise is one of many great memories I will take from my time in Japan.- Customer service at the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo is one of the best I've experienced anywhere- The location, while not the most exciting, is very central and it is very easy to get anywhere one could possibly wish to get to in TokyoHowever....- The room, while spacious, is underwhelming does not compare to the common areas and could do with an update- I ate at one of the restaurants, and while it was good, it was extremely expensive for what you get, even when compared to other fine dining experiences I've had around the world, including my home (and comparably expensive) city of London- The use of the sauna etc is only complimentary for hotel guests early in the morning. A bit of a niggle given how much you are paying for a night here. However this appears to be common in Japan (in fact other hotels I stayed at didn't even have any complimentary slots for hotel guests)- Wifi is not free unless you book directly with the hotel. This is a policy of the Mandarin Oriental group of hotels and an annoying one if you (a). have things you need to organise while you are away and (b). wish to book through a hotel booking website in order to collect air miles / loyalty points etc. I find it a bit of an odd policy given the price point of the Mandarin Oriental hotels and that these days wifi is generally included by other hotels for free.","London, United Kingdom","Nomadiclondoner2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",13,4.0

I booked all hotels through GrandLuxuryHotels and have been very pleased by the service offered and all the upgrades we received. The Mandarin Oriental has beaten all expectations: after check in we asked, if we could receive a bigger room. We have been told, the first night is fully booked (New Years Eve), but there is a possibility for the next day. January 1st, we have been upgraded to a huge corner suite with two separate rooms, a huge bathroom plus a separate bathroom for guests. Breakfast, high speed internet, two loaded PASMO tickets (ach Yen 3'000) and a USD 100 Credit was complementary. The view from our room was breathtaking, the service level imperial! We had a great New Year's Eve dinner at Signature (French Restaurant) and they even reserved seats for us at the bar afterwards. The two other nights, we had dinner at Sense, the Cantonese restaurant. Those two restaurants are highly recommended (see separate evaluation)! Breakfast is being served in two different restaurants: one with a nice buffet, the other one is served: try out at the second one the egg Benedict with lobster...

Great wooden accents and open bathrooms equipped with rain shower and extra size jacuzzi. No complaints, small nit-pick is that soundproofing seems light though my neighbors were very respectful.2) Food: Raul insisted I try the hotel's own sushi restaurant in addition to the more celebrated ones I was trying around the city and I must say it was fantastic, if not better than the other more well known ones I tried. Will review this separately but incredible that the sous chef Hojo San stacked up favorably to Michellin starred chefs out on their own. Breakfast was also a pleasure, best French toast I've ever had. Although word from the wise, their pancakes aren't really pancakes as any one else would know them, so make sure to specify.3) Spa: simply divine and will forever spoil me as I don't think I'll ever get a massage or personalized experience any where else. The water lounges overlooking the city are simply mesmerizing.4) Service: team was very helpful in securing my reservations at all the restaurants and despite some trouble at the last minute they were able to save the day. Staff across the board are super friendly and aim to please. You won't be disappointed. Incredible how even the masseuse at the spa knew about the purpose of my journey, and Maria in guest services knew I was on my way to Manila after Tokyo, they really do take the time to make it a personalized experience and I doubt I was spending as much as many of the patrons there.

With the lobby on the 38th floor and guest room floors just below, customers enjoy expansive vistas regardless of what direction their room faces. As wonderful as the hotel facilities and central location are the thing that impressed us the most was the attention to detail, work ethic and genuine desire to please exhibited by every hotel staff member we had occasion to interact with. One example - leaving our room one morning I unknowingly turned on the do not disturb sign. When we arrived back late in the afternoon we noticed the room had not been cleaned so I called for service. I was informed why it had not been done (DND light on) and that they would send someone right up. Two ladies arrived within 5 minutes. I apologized and informed them that we just needed new towels and the trash removed, nothing else was important. The ladies insisted, politely, on doing a complete cleaning. Then, when they were done one of them, in her best english, thanked us for our patience and said that ""it was an honor to be allowed to serve you"". WOW, we were overwelmed by her genuine and heart felt remarks, made even more impressive by the fact that I had really inconvenienced THEM.

The accolades are true - the customer service here is superlative. Peninsula service tends to be much more impersonal and perfunctory. There was almost always a queue at the Peninsula concierge desk which necessited us having to wait to have a query answered. In contrast, the MO staff take the trouble to find out and remember your name, and in almost every interaction with them, be it reception, concierge or housekeeping, I was addressed by name. The concierge service is excellent. They were really responsive to our emails before the trip when I sought their help with restaurant reservations. There were a few staff members manning the concierge desk and we seldom had to wait, and if we did, it was a short wait. Even housekeeping was fantastic. They have the most extensive pillow menu I have seen so far. When I asked before coming if they had a power transformer so that I could use a 220v electrical appliance in the room, I was assured (somewhat to my surprise) that they did, and lo and behold, I found it waiting in the room, all ready for use, when we checked in. Little touches like a lovely essential oil scent and mochi during turndown added to the experience.The only downsides to this amazing hotel, in my opinion, are first, that there is no swimming pool (if this matters to you), and second, the location.

Period. Located in the Nihonbashi Mitsui Tower in Tokyo’s historic Nihonbashi neighborhood, close to Tokyo Station and Tokyo Stock Exchange and surrounded by many shops and restaurants (many good restos in the Corrado Nihonbashi buildings across the street). MO is a short cab ride to many favoured Tokyo destinations including Ginza, Ueno Park and Roppongi (if one must). It's also a short distance to the Imperial Palace gardens for a really pleasant run - easy run there/back. Facilities are truly superb - rooms, spa (spa facilities recognised by the travel press as a top destination globally) and dining/drinks options. The bar on the 27th floor has many seating options, excellent jazz and a warm, relaxed vibe. I should note that smoking is allowed at the bar, which is my preferred seating. Rooms are spacious and I like the open shower concept (not to Westerner's liking but this wet room concept is very common in Asia). Beyond the globally consistently high MO standards, it's the staff who truly distinguish themselves in Tokyo. From the moment one arrives MO staff provide incredible care and attention. I have observed this care on many occasions as guests have every need or question expertly addressed. This MO standard is well-above and beyond what might expect in Asia, a region known for hospitality and attention to detail. Housekeeping, Room Service, Gym, Spa, Dining - incredible care and attention. Prior to my arrival I spent two weeks coordinating several dinner reservations with the MO Concierge (most high-end Tokyo restos require hotel confirmation for out-of-region guests). Concierges Daisuke Hikota, Ana Gervasio, Asuka Kon, Yuna Choi were incredibly helpful to secure preferred dining reservations, offer-up alternative recommendations, provide directions and other insights, including museum and sightseeing options. Importantly, MO staff ask many questions to ensure that their guidance is appropriate.We saw Maria Yano nearly every day during our stay. She was incredibly helpful providing further insight into Tokyo, thankfully steering us away from tourist/expat neighbourhoods towards areas where we could really enjoy more of the local colour. She was genuinely interested to hear of our daily exploits and always had a fresh idea or recommendation on- offer. I am in Tokyo on business 4-5 times a year and always stay at the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo. It has a level of charm and simplicity that resonates w me on all levels.

Given the city's reputation for having among the tiniest of hotel rooms in the world, the rooms at The Mandarin are very spacious, beautifully appointed with Japanese charm that blend with modern decor and conveniences. The latter included a personal favorite : Bang and Olufsen Philippe Stark Bluetooth speakers that paired instantly with my smartphone. Blinds and curtains that drew open in the mornings with a switch were a favorite of my companion as it gave him a spectacular view of the city's skyline including the iconic Tokyo Tower.

Incredible and magical in person, we were overwhelmed initially. The service was impeccable and our room wonderful. Everything was great until around 1:00am, I started hearing tapping noises. Kept me from a sound sleep. Next day, once again the hotel met all our needs. Breakfast was fantastic and the lobby bar at sunset became an instant lifetime memory. However, at 1:00am again, the tapping started. And again, I had a restless night. This time, I addressed the manager about providing a solution. He assured me that at breakfast, we would be informed of his options. 20 minutes later, he suggested that we pack our bags(3 large suitcases) and than be moved to an upgraded room on the top floor. The notion of changing to a better and quieter room was the incentive to spend the time to pack to move. Hours later when we returned, rather than be escorted to our new room, the staff told us they had made a different decision. They had solved the problem and we would remain in the room. Never an explanation of the solution nor an apology. As I have learned in my visit to Japan, ones offer of an apology is integrated in the society. Our original plan was to return for our final two days to the Mandarin. That would be a true test of its greatness if the had made any effort to make us satisfied. Since that did not happen, our itinerary was altered and we switched to The Palace.

Of course, there is always the Mitsukoshi department store next door (the food hall at the basement is a must visit). If you want to venture out more, ask about the local bus which offers free rides and loops around the area. The hotel is also situated conveniently above the subway (Mitsukoshimae station). All rooms are very spacious.

Mt. Fuji mountain view is nice to have but not a must if you’ve stayed here before (in fact when we were there, the mountain was covered with clouds for days). The hotel is at the top 9 floors of the 34-story Nihonbashi Mitsui Tower, so all rooms got amazing view. The spa offers a spectacular wet area (steam/sauna/jet pool). Hotel guests can use this area for free before 9am in the mornings. The restaurants/bars/lounge in the hotel all seem to be doing very well as they are full most of the time. Make sure you book ahead! Suggest to try the Japanese set breakfast, dinner at the Tapas Molecular bar, afternoon tea at the Lounge (like all the Japanese ladies do), pizza at the café, weekend wine brunch, and taste a rare Japanese whisky at the bar! OR, there is also the MO cake shop and the super high-end fruit store Nihonbashi Sembikiya at the ground floor.Excellent staff at the hotel which truly distinguishes this hotel from the other 5-star hotels in Tokyo.

Perhaps can't blame the Mandarin, but it was a 3 star Michelin restaurant, presumably known to be in demand, and we ended up with a 10pm dinner seating. The taxi, though given printed directions in Japanese from concierge and guidance from the Mandarin staff, took us to the wrong location (within a couple blocks), even stepped out to point us in the right (wrong) direction.

Like the Park Hyatt, it is situated on top of an office block, with the lobby on level 38 and the rooms on the levels below this - a little disconcerting, as you need to go uo to the lobby from your room before changing elevators to go down to street level, however it does allow for some spectacular views, and a beautifully designed lobby/bar/restaurant area.The rooms are large by Japanese standards, and very comfortable, although becoming a little dated and will require updating soon, and service was impeccable as expected from a MO property.Disappointingly, MO Tokyo does not offer a club level with the inclusions that come with the Oriental Club. There is also no in-room ironing board or iron. In room wifi comes at a cost unless you have a profile set up on the MO website or have it specifically included in your package. The ""vitality pool"", whilst visually spectacular, is available to guests only between the hours of 0630 and 0900 - after that, you will be charged JPY 7000 to use it - rather outrageous on top of the already high room rate (apparently to ""avoid congestion with people paying to use the spa treatment facilities"").These are small annoyances, and overall the MO Tokyo is still certainly a very pleasant place to stay. If the vitality pool was available in the evenings as well as at dawn, and if their was a Club option, then I would be very happy to return.","Sydney, Australia","dr_gasman88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",41,5.0

The experience is magical, won't tell you anything about it, better if it's a surprise but dont miss it. We were very touched at the end as the chef did something special for our honeymoon that of course he knew!

So the last day, before going to the airport, we booked the bar counter of their Pizza restaurant... and OMG, you cannot miss that. That was the best pizzas ever, even better than in Napoli!

The rooms are spotless and relatively large by Asian standards. My room had an almost spa-like bathroom with separate shower and a huge bathtub. I really love the breakfast, where you have a huge selection of both western and Japanese style food. The only minor complaint I have is that the French style restaurant is not 100%, but that's something they share with most western style restaurants I've visited in Tokyo. I would have much preferred if it was a Japanese restaurant. But OTOH, there's an excellent Sushi restaurant just across the street.If you're not used to Japanese hotels it might be a bit confusing that the hotel lobby is not located on the ground floor. So upon arrival you take the elevator to the lobby and then there are separate elevators to move around in the hotel.As part of an international chain, the Mandarin can feel a bit sterile - If it wasn't for the staff it could even be difficult to realize you are in Japan.

The 38th floor reception area is beautiful and dramatic and is accompanied by two wonderful bars on the 37th floor. As a person that usually stays in 5 star hotels, I was very impressed with this hotel in many, many ways. The location was perfect for us as it is literally at one of the subway stops (Mitsukoshimae-next door to the the all-purpose/fun to visit department store Mitsukoski) on the ""orange line"" that can easily connect you to Shibuya (also a short taxi ride to Ebisu), Ginza, Ueno, and Asakusa-all super interesting places to visit. The highlight of this hotel is the service. The check-in was fantastic. The concierge service was amazing and extremely helpful. We did not take any tour and explored Tokyo on our own and had a great time. We worked with many of the concierges, but Tomoya Mori was one of the best I have every worked with-great job Tomoya! The breakfast was amazing and thanks to the over the top service by the breakfast manager, Niccolo Brachelente-our visit was very special indeed.

He explained that the desk phone had an LED touch screen that would allow us to access several of the room features at the touch of a button. However, in this room, the screen wouldn't work. He apologized for the inconvenience, called someone immediately and the phone was fixed within the hour. NOT a big deal to us but we ended up getting a written note of apology from not only the head of housekeeping, Takehiro Hosoi, but from the hotel general manager, Thomas Combescot, as well. In addition to that, the front desk staff also apologized to us and sent up a tray of specialty chocolates for our inconvenience. WHAT??? I spent the rest of the week earnestly looking everywhere for other faults or issues so that I could peruse myself of more of those tasty morsels but alas there were no further problems to be found. In truth, this is the kind of place that you read about but you must experience to understand the level of service that is routinely given here. For instance, months before our arrival, Maria Yano, in guest relations, reached out to us to inquire about anything that we might need during our stay. Whether it was directions or suggestions on places to dine or how to figure out the best way to negotiate Shinjuku Station, she was always ready to assist us. Niccolo Brachelente, the breakfast manager, would stop by our table each morning to inquire about how our day went. He made sure that all of our requests were taken care of promptly and went out of his way to make our dining experience a pleasurable one.Chef Kento at the Tapas Molecular Bar-many thanks for a wonderful time! This guy was channeling chemistry, biomolecular physics and Michelin-starred cuisine into a night that won’t be forgotten!  Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention our maid. I never got the chance to meet her but her efforts on our behalf were fantastic! She kept that room spotless and beautiful. Everything had its place. I accidentally flipped over one of the sugar cube packets in the small lacquered box by the Nespresso machine. My fat fingers were too big to turn it back right side up so I left it there never thinking that anyone would take the time to place it back right side up. Lo and behold, when we returned to our room that night, I opened the box up and saw that they were all back right side up! Impressive…We’re already making plans to return next year.

The lobby is situated on the 38th floor of a high rise building , but the rooms are on lower floors. So, to go to your room you go up to the 38th floor and walk across the lobby to an elevator to go to lower floors. There are broad views of Tokyo and the rooms are supplied with binoculars. I was surprised to find that our Grand King room had a bathroom with only one small square sink. The charming Rooms Manager Raoul explained that the suites had two sinks and that they were planning to renovate the hotel. The hotel has no Club lounge and the buffet breakfast is $38.00. The selections were ample and the smoked salmon was excellent .There is no swimming pool, though there is a well appointed fitness center. The Bar is particularly attractive with tables set on stone islands in the midst of running water. The Assistant Director of Rooms, Mr. Kaseda was particularly helpful as we tried to figure out where in the room to place an extra bed for a child . It was adequate for two nights. When compared to other hotels in the price range in Tokyo, I felt it was not competitive. Another hotel of similar price and stature offers a concierge lounge that includes free drinks, including alcohol, and four different menus all day long . A swimming pool is also included and upgrades more often available. Be careful if you ask the Mandarin to provide transportation to Narita, They were about to confirm a van for three people at a charge of 725 dollars. Luckily I caught it before it was too late. A similar van from Narita Air Transport was 225 dollars.","Alexandria, Virginia","celebrationtiger</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alexandria, Virginia</strong>",248,3.0

Any request is met promptly and graciously. Shoes need to be shined and returned immediately? No problem. Milk in refrigerator for morning coffee with decaf only capsules for Nespresso machine? No problem and no repeat requests. Room has stunning decor and the bathroom with the wooden slat floors, wonderful showers and deep bathtub (big enough for two) that fills quickly because of the superb water pressure. You never hear vacuums or other housekeeping noise, the sound proofing is excellent. Only negative is that smoking is allowed in the bar one floor below the lobby and because it is open to the lobby area it permeates the hotel lobby. We had an interesting conversation with the Italian chef (from Rome) of the Italian restaurant on site. He was in the dining area chatting with the guests and after I commented that unless you have good tomatoes you really shouldn't offer a caprese salad and he sent out a plate of much better tomatoes which were in a different salad after agreeing with me about the quality between the two offerings.

Quality and attention to detail are evident everywhere from the furnishings, the service, the food to the calibre and personal qualities of staff. We unexpectedly ran out of a routine medication and the reception/concierge staff could not have been more helpful in organising a prompt solution. I remember Kano's central role in organising things but all the staff were extremely helpful. The hotel is well located with easy access to the subway, a number of major department stores as well as other city facilities.

This reservation alone is important for me, as it was a promise I made to my wife when I proposed to her a year ago.

I'm a very picky 5 star traveler and quite frankly I can often find fault where others see none. Attention to detail is important to me; I don't mind paying a high price for service, but the other party has to do their part in the transaction and I feel MOTYO really lived up to their promise to me. Prior to our stay I engaged to concierge re sumo and kabuki tickets. While responses were somewhat delayed, the final result in terms of the tickets provided was great. Sumo tickets were particularly well chosen and I'm glad I entrusted the concierge with my credit card info ahead of time to get these things anchored before we arrived, as they would have been in short supply otherwise considering the timing of our stay which spanned Golden Week. We stayed 9 nights (May 2-11) in what I suspect to be the lowest grade room they have. It was a king room, on floor 32, overlooking Mt. Fuji (which we actually did see on a couple of occasions although I understand normally the weather makes sighting difficult in spring/summer). Winter sighting is much more reliable. Glad we didn't pay extra for this view, however it was special when we saw it. The room was lovely, yes, possibly showing some small signs of wear but on the whole still very beautiful and cared for. Bed was firm but cozy. Bedding beautifully soft and pressed and a large pillow menu that we used. Most astounding was the quiet and silence in the room. Never any hallway noise from adjacent room doors or guests and the hvac too was silent! Bathrooms worked brilliantly and shower area some had complained about on tripadvisor was not an issue at all. Again, everything beautifully maintained and cleaned. Toto washlet great obviously. Our room rate included breakfast and wifi and was negotiated directly with the hotel ahead of time considering the length of our stay. Wifi worked great on multiple devices with one single sign-on for our total duration with none of the daily signing in that is often required to access wifi in other, even 5-star, hotels. There was plenty of bandwidth available for FaceTime. Breakfast was beautiful and has been commented about at length in other reviews so I won't mention it other than to say that it made me cry on the first day because it was presented so well. Service was a bit over the top and some have criticized it as being contrived but after a number of days we could see this was truly the standard of MOTYO service and they are proud of it. That put the service into context for us. Extremely attentive and polite is what it was. We also had almost daily breakfast visits from the restaurant manager Kai who was interested in our plans for the day and helped to make recommendations for us with details. Smokiness many have complained about was somewhat evident in the lobby but was not a significant problem to me and I'm somewhat sensitive to smell. During our stay we used concierge services quite a bit for restaurants and maps and locations for shops and other things. All advice was good. We often had pounds of change which they converted to bills for us without batting an eye and ditto provided smaller bills no trouble after our visits to bank machine. I guess this is no big deal, but just something I really appreciated. Turndown service was great, flexible, and fast. We made use of the yakatas and appreciated the signature essential oil and after asking were provided with a sample upon checking out. We made use of the spa/jacuzzi/sauna one morning early when it's available to guests without extra charge. It was ok but helpful to see how other Japanese guests were using it. I just followed what they were doing and it all worked great. In-room dining provided fresh milk gratis for my tea in the morning as I preferred not to use the capsules provided. Ditto they cut one of the lovely mizakaya mangoes we had sourced ourselves out during the day. All free. This was something I really appreciated...no nickel-and-diming. We used the hotel car service to and from Narita which is very expensive yes, but which is always an awesome convenience and a great thing if it can be afforded. Car (Mercedes S class) was roomy and driver was great and upon checkout many staff from the hotel were present to make sure we had everything in order upon departure for our long journey home. At this price, you assume all the big things will be looked after so it becomes the little things that make the difference. For me the little things that so often go wrong and which MOTYO got right were the quiet room and hvac, the seamless wifi login, the elevator operation (once the doors start closing another guest pressing the call button does not interrupt the operation), the concierge recommendations and ticket service, the straightforward billing and absence of nickel-and-diming, and just the apparent ease with which everything is done. Service, service, service. Would definitely stay again perhaps next year in the fall. Have stayed at many 5-star and otherwise exclusive properties around the world including all the major brands at this price level (Four Seasons, The Peninsula, Shangri-La, and so on) and I think MOTYO may have done the best job ever.

Everything is impeccable and top notch. My only critique I can give is that it is astronomically expensive and caters to a clientele for whom money is no object. I think that is what they are going for, and they succeed, so they still deserve all of that 5 star rating, but if you are a traveler on the fence between this and something a few notches down in price, you don't actually need to spend this much money to have a great time in Tokyo. Tokyo as a city is just as much about the little local spots and cheap eats as it is about 5-star luxury.Our room had an unbelievable view of Tokyo. The design and the craftsmanship in the lobby, elevator, hallways, and rooms is impressive. We decided to have room service one night just because the room was so darn nice. Their service is top notch. You stay here and you are among by the elite of Tokyo travelers. The food we had in the hotel was delicious. I mean, the menu prices are a little eye popping but like I said, this is not a value option.Pro tip: the Mitsukoshimae station on the Tokyo Metro is extremely convenient. Exit A7 takes you directly up to the hotel. The Ginza line is the best. Yes, the Hanzomon line stops here too, but the walk to and from the Hanzomon line is kind of long. For example, if you are at Shibuya crossing, and you are plotting your route back to the hotel, take the Ginza line rather than the Hanzomon line, even though they both go to Mitsukoshimae station. As I write this, I realize that most people who are staying in this hotel will probably just pay up for taxis or ubers -- but the subway is quite fast and convenient even for big shots!",,SJB411,28,5.0

There are lots of restaurants in the area, but the dining options in the hotel are hard to resist. Our favorites were K’Shiki for breakfast in the morning and Italian in the evening, Ventaglio for a Mediterranean buffet, and the Mandarin Bar for a nightcap.

Mandarin Oriental is a brand I will put my full trust in every time!My room (a twin) was enormous with a desk, plenty of storage and luggage space for two people and a nespresso machine, which is always a nice touch. The room had huge windows with the most amazing views over the Tokyo skyline (nice that there were binoculars in the room too). The decor was really simple and neutral and felt very luxurious. Great wifi. The bathroom was large with floor to ceiling marble. The bath large and comfortable. Lots of very good quality amenities, plus really good kimonos, and top quality robes and slippers. Probably the best hotel slippers I've seen!The location is fantastic, very easy to get to and to explore from. The hotel is right on top of Mitsukoshi subway station and only a ten minute walk (or three minute cab) to Tokyo central station. Once you're in the hotel however, there's a good chance you won't want to leave! The facilities are really five star! The restaurants are sensational (michelin stars all round), the bar (although not cheap) is the perfect place to watch the sunset over a cocktail, the spa is really great and the jacuzzi must have the best views of any in the world! The only thing I found a little disappointing, was that there are two separate jacuzzis. One for men and one for women. Personally I would have liked to use a mixed one so that couples or friends can share the experience and the outstanding views together. Also, it's free for guests to use before 10am, but if you want to use it during the day, there is a fee. I didn't use the gym, but I had a look and it's well equipped with free water and fresh juices. Also, don't miss a visit to the Mandarin Oriental gourmet shop! The cakes and sweets here are totally divine and not overpriced. Perfect little afternoon treat stop!The breakfast buffet was really amazing. All kinds of Japanese foods, including rice, salmon, vegetables, dumplings as well as all the usual western favourites, I think there were even four varieties of bacon to choose from!! I ordered the french toast as well (included for free) and it was some of the best I have ever had. Overall, I would highly recommend a stay at the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo. Everything about my stay was great. It's a top hotel and the staff ho out of their way to make every guest feel like a VIP.

Everyone at the hotel acknowledges you with a smile as you walk past and are keen to help if required. As you would expect the hotel has a very upmarket feel to it, but not in a brash way. We stayed in a Deluxe Premier Room on the 35th Floor. Great views of Tokyo and the Tokyo Skytree from the floor to ceiling windows. Very comfortable, nicely decorated, everything you need. Bathroom is spacious and well appointed. My only minor gripe is that I think it's a bit petty to be charging for Wi-Fi?We had breakfast and dined at the Pizza Bar for lunch. Breakfasts are excellent, everything you could want with multiple choices of most things. The Pizza's at the Pizza Bar are really good, and were freshly prepared by the chef as we watched while sat at the bar.Really got to appreciate everything about this hotel the more I stayed there and would definitely recommend.","Kent, England","Brandy_Balancer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kent, England</strong>",44,5.0

We usually stay at Four Seasons properties, but may need to change our allegiance, thanks to an exceptional stay at the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo!First and foremost, the location is excellent-- not far from Ginza-- there is a subway in the basement of the hotel! The other floors house my favorite premium Japanese fruit store and fruit parlor too. The lobby on the 38th floor provides tremendous views of the entire city, and the view from our suite on the 32nd floor was equally as breathtaking. What this Mandarin property excels at is service, but in a genuine, true hospitable way. From the moment we stepped on property, our luggage was brought to our room with lightning speed, and everyone knew our name and preferences. The smiles and helpfulness aren't fake, and you can tell the staff takes pride in providing an excellent experience to guests. An example is the breakfast manager, Niccolo. Every morning, we ate at the buffet, which includes made-to-order egg dishes, like a crab eggs benedict. Niccolo not only recommended it to us, but went so far as to explain how the eggs come from chickens that eat rosehips and hibiscus flowers and have a rich red yolk to match the deeply developed taste. He also remembered our beverage preferences each morning, and offered us treats he thought we'd enjoy, like fresh blueberry juice, or a plate of assorted Japanese fruits. He wasn't available on our last day, but he sent us a box of cookies and teas to our room to thank us for coming to dine at his restaurant. The spa is also quite stunning. The soaking bath and sauna have the same views as the lobby-- overlooking the entire Tokyo skyline. The steam room is also beautifully tiled and ultra relaxing. The changing areas include high-end lotions, body cleanser and every toiletry you can imagine! The only hiccup was with a communication flaw in booking several restaurant reservations. Our travel agent had sent a cancellation request for a Michelin-starred sushi restaurant, but the hotel overlooked it and had contacted us via email during our stay to ask why we didn't show up for the reservation. We explained our agent had cancelled for us, and they apologized for the mix up. Ultimately, we'll absolutely come back to the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo in the future! PS: We are currently staying at the MO in Taipei, and while luxurious, doesn't compare to Tokyo's service & staff!","San Francisco, California","Dion L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",4,5.0

It was truly excellent in every way.The room - we had a fairly standard category 'deluxe premier' room, but it was immensely comfortable, well designed, and had a great view out to the Tokyo Skytree. The look and feel of the rooms would remind you very strongly of the rooms at the MO in Singapore, but they're a bit more spacious and have a very convenient day-bed/couch near the window which became a favourite perching spot. The bathroom was also a very good size, and the shower was blissful. All rooms are between the 30th and 37th floor of the building, so I assume all have very good views.The amenities - we ate at 2 (of the 5) restaurants in the hotel, and grabbed a regular nightcap at 1 (of the 2) bars and all were excellent. We also made very extensive use of the concierge, engaging them about 2 months before our trip to line up some restaurant bookings for us at a some recommended places. They did a phenomenal job, in particular ensuring that I would be comfortable with seating arrangements, especially at some of the smaller counter-style sushi or tempura restaurants. They print out clear directions to all restaurants for the cab driver, which is an absolute must in Tokyo. They also sourced us Ghibli Museum tickets, which we were delighted about. I didn't use the spa or the fitness centre on this trip, so can't comment on those.Some general stuff - the main lobby of the hotel is a wonderful space, and a real pleasure to come back to after the hustle and bustle of the city. You always receive a very genuine welcome from any staff in the lobby at the time, and it really feels like 'coming home' (I know it sounds corny, but it works). The hotel's location is also excellent - both for wandering around the immediate area (you're at the very top of the main Ginza shopping area), but also because one of the stops on the Ginza subway line is in the basement of the hotel building. The building also has a nicely spacious porte-cochere where there is always a taxi waiting, and where anyone picking you up or dropping you off can do so calmly - none of this mad scramble to get out of the way of traffic which you can often have in city-centre hotels. Simply put, I don't have a single negative thing to say about our 5 night stay at the MO Tokyo. It was wonderful from start to finish, and we were very sorry to leave. We are already planning a return trip.","Carmarthen, United Kingdom","Fouski</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carmarthen, United Kingdom</strong>",35,5.0

The hotel is on top of an office building with a side entrance. Our bags were immediately taken and we were shown to the elevators that took us up to the lobby.Entering the lobby, we were impressed by the staff who welcomed us. Check-in was quick and we took another elevator down to our room (card key needed which I find a pain fumbling for my card). We had 2 twin beds with a view of Tokyo Skytree. The room was quite spacious and a fresh fruit plate welcomed us. We did find a lack of drawer space for our stuff (after 3 weeks of traveling in Asia, we had lots of stuff). Wifi was free as part of our rate and was consistent throughout our stay. The location of the hotel is excellent. Business area so quiet at night. Lots of shopping close by with Mitsukoshi next door (we picked up plenty of food gifts), Takashimaya and Tokyo train station all in walking distance. The building has a food court in the basement which was quite crowded during lunch time and is connected to the Ginza and Hanzomon subway lines. Taxis were abundant at the hotel but the subway in Tokyo was really efficient to get around the city.We used the gym while we were at the hotel which is tiny. Equipment was nearly on top of each other. There was no floor area to stretch. Disappointed in this area.We did not eat at the restaurants but did have the breakfast at the hotel every morning. What surprised me was the need to wait for a table on two of our days at K'shiki. They actually asked us to sit in the Oriental Lounge (which serves a quick Continental breakfast) and wait. Overall the buffet was good and service was good. We had asked the concierge for help prior to our trip to Japan. I was surprised at how slow responses were and how they misread some of my questions. I asked for information on N'ex to NRT in an email as I had an early flight and wanted to plan ahead. They sent me a response on Transportation options from Narita to the hotel several days later. They also mixed up a restaurant for me offering me a lunch slot when the restaurant is only open for dinner. Every email response required a few days for a response. I'm not sure if they are overwhelmed or prioritize based on requests that are closer. Check-out in the morning was fine with the bill correct. Bell boys helped gather our luggage and put us in a taxi to Tokyo station for our N'ex connection to the airport.Overall, I enjoyed the hotel but of course remember the negatives. I love the MO and this was my 4th MO in 2015. Considering my stays in Osaka and Kyoto were better and Tokyo has several wonderful hotels, I'd probably shop around next time.","New York City, New York","johnathome</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",144,4.0

For the past ten years we have been visiting Japan at least once a year. Prior to this year, we stayed at the Peninsula for 6 or 7 consecutive years. Every summer, very large suite, no less than 8 days total. Absolutely no complaints about the room, the location - all wonderful. But every year we visit, we are treated like total strangers. Total. No ""welcome back"", no ""nice to see you again"", no special welcome for our young daughter who has spent 7 of her 9 years of life visiting that hotel, no nothing at all. And every year it has kind of bugged me - after all, we spend a lot of money and have been very loyal customers. (I get that this is what you might call a first world issue and I do not pretend that any of this matters in the scheme of things). This past summer the hotel was booked up so we were ""forced"" to stay at the Mandarin Oriental. We only stayed three days because we were off to somewhere else in Japan. Everything superlative. SU-PER-LA-TIVE. And believe me, that is not a word you get to use too often these days. This morning we received a thick envelope covered in Hello Kitty stickers from the Mandarin Oriental. It contained a handwritten note to my daughter from the breakfast manager who remarked how she was looking forward to seeing her again and making her chocolate chip pancakes. It included a lovely MO calendar on which she is doodling on right now.

We chose it again because it is easy for shopping, being right next to the huge department store Mitsukoshi, where we enjoyed looking at the huge basement floor displaying fantastic Japanese food items. There is also a subway station right underneath the hotel, with another huge shopping area (underground) called Nihonbashi. Since we had only 2 days in the city, a central location was critical. The hotel is also just a 10-minute taxi ride (even with traffic) to Tokyo Station, where we caught a bullet train to the countryside. Ginza (with even more night lights around Christmas) is also just 10 minutes away by taxi.The spa is just fabulous. It is on a high floor with a fabulous panoramic city view. There is a huge jacuzzi pool/tub with a clear glass surround where you can see your own reflection in the wall mirror through the clear pool glass. My 18-year old daughter thought it was just so much fun. My daughter and I had a 2-hour couple massage in a corner room with an amazing city view. The price tag was high, but it was just heavenly, especially after a 15-hour flight plus hours of taxi and wait time door-to-door from our home to Tokyo. The rooms were also fabulous with all the amenities and zen beauty. The room size was very large even by American standard.We loved the refined buffet breakfast with huge assortments of delicious items. The crab egg benedict with the orange color egg yoke (due to special foods fed to the chicken producing the eggs) was tasty and interesting. We also tried the a la carte breakfast in another dining room, and the service was amazing. We had dinner one night at the 8-person Sushi Sora (again with an amazing view and lovely zen environment) and another night at the tapas molecular bar (also for 8 persons only). The taps bar was creative, fun, and delicious.Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo is like a mini resort within just one building in the heart of Tokyo.

Hotel location - Convenient despite being in the quieter side of town, but Mitsukoshimae Metro station is just underground, and Tokyo station is just a pleasant 10 min walk away. There are many high end shopping complexes around MO.2. Hotel grounds and room -The lobby is located on the 38th floor with a commanding view of Tokyo. On one side, you can see the Tokyo Skytree, while on the other, Mount Fuji (on a clear day). Rooms are well-sized and the design is modern with a touch of Orientalism. The shower room has a bathtub and 3 choices of shower heads to choose from. Toiletries are from Bottega Veneta. 3. Service - Outstanding service from check-in to check-out. A staff introduced the room and hotel amenities upon check-in with a welcome bottle of Oriental tea. Turn down service came with a set of yukata and aromatherapy oil. 4. Breakfast - Breakfast could be enjoyed at either K'Shiki allday dining restaurant or Oriental Lounge. We had it at the former which had a good spread for its continental breakfast. The quality of food was good. The could be improved points:1. Hotel gym -I am an avid gym goer so the gym was too small and had limited equipment for a decent weight training session. However, free beverages like juices and Pokka Sweat, and biscuits were available. 2. Wifi -My biggest grouse would be that Wifi was not free. In all, MO Tokyo was still a great stay and I would recommend it over Park Hyatt on the other side of the city. I will surely come back again!

Added to this is the fact that the hotel has, to our taste, truly elegant Japanese design in the rooms and the public spaces. And the hotel rooms are large and comfortable. One doesn't need to go up Tokyo Tower nor Skytree as the views from the hotel are panoramic. The Chinese and Sushi restaurants would be star quality as stand alone restaurants; therefore it was doubly nice to have them in-house. We did not have a chance to eat in the French restaurant and so cannot speak to it, Breakfast in K'shiki is delightful and it turns out that the restaurant does pasta in the truly Italian manner. If you like your lasagna with béchamel rather than tomato sauce, order it here. The hotel is centrally located and having a subway station in the basement means that getting around Tokyo was easy.

Other than the concierge, whose service level is inconsistent, we were attended to sincerely and professionally. Special mention goes to Ms Seong Park and Ms P Mui; they were attentive, gracious and very helpful. The elderly housekeeping female staff who took care of Rm 3511 was also wonderfully attentive. We liked the location of the hotel too. The Ginza line is conveniently located right below the hotel. Shopping and food are also readily available (across the road is Coredo with many restaurants and down the road, less than 5 minutes away, is a big mall). The room is generally well appointed although I did not like the bathroom. The sink is too small and the shower area does not have a proper door. We really liked the bed. I slept extremely well because of the mattress. I am particular about these things because I've gotten up in the morning with backaches in other hotels and so really appreciated the comfort. All in all, we are happy with the hotel but I have to say that the concierge is rather disappointing. To be fair, one of the female staff (her name starts with N) was very helpful and went out of her way to get us the information that we needed. The other staff, especially a young gentleman whose name I cannot recall, was frustrating to deal with. We were given a Japanese map (we are foreigners who can't speak or read Japanese), we were told to look for the email address of a cafe on our own, we could not get any information on how to rent an ETC card. The concierge is the main reason I gave this hotel 4 stars out of five. We had a corporate rate so we had good value for money, but if we had to pay the published board rate, the level of service rendered by the concierge would really annoy me.

It was very insulting the way she coldly dismissed us only to have it corrected when we asked fir management. She reminded me of the typical stern & cold personality that is of the old Japan. We were expecting them to be accommodating the way they were in NYC when we had our wedding at the NYC location but was frustrated when they were cold & unwelcoming. They pretty much wanted us to get out upon checking out noted by the way they were surprised that we asked to leave our bags with the bellmen while we had a drink at the bar.

It's an unfortunate side-effect of staying in one of the most space scarce cities in the world, and they attempt to make up for it with amazing views and quality furnishings and amenities. However, I still cannot reconcile that price with the size of the room and amenities available.Additionally I was underwhelmed by the quality of the breakfast, and the selection.

The hotel and service were really good, but with such other good options in Tokyo this was unfortunately not as good as others. I think I prefer the Park Hyatt or the Conrad which were truly excellent. Check-in was a bit slow and the room was not ready when I got there, on top of that, for some reason the girl at the reception was giving me a lot of attitude (which is not something you're expecting after a 12-hour flight, specially in Japan!). When you check-in, they 'offer' you the chance to use the jacuzzi and spa for free from 6:30 to 9am! I never heard of a luxury hotel charging for using their jacuzzi when you're staying with them!The hotel gets really crowded during lunch time and on the weekends, which makes elevators and taxis difficult to come by. The fitness center is rather small for such a hotel. It was empty every time and there's all the machines needed but the room is so small that all the machines are really close to each other. For laundry service, they are supposed to have a special notification system that alerts them when you need them to pick up laundry but it never worked and it took them a while whenever I needed them to pick up my laundry. They also forgot to leave new laundry bags everyday. The concierge service is a hit or miss. Some of them are quite good and they really go out of their way to truly help you, while others are just not up to the standards of a luxury hotel. The first one that 'helped' me seemed a little bit lost, I had to ask for specific places instead of him recommending. And I noticed the same thing happening to several other guests during different times of my stay. On the following day, one of the concierge recommended the biggest rip-off restaurant I've ever been to! And it turned out to be some sort of a deal between the concierge and the restaurant because when we arrived to the restaurant they mentioned we had the 'special price' for clients of the hotel. Next day the concierge kept saying no places were available at night instead of finding solutions for a restaurant that could be open until late; which I knew from my previous stays at the Park Hyatt or the Conrad that while difficult to find in Tokyo, they exist and are quite good. The rooms themselves are actually amazing!!! Good size, perfect decoration; although it can feel a bit stiff. TV is slightly outdated, but that's jus me been picky.

Location fantastic. Less than 5 minutes from our room to the Ginza line platform. Tokyo station within walking distance, Ginza and Shibuya only few minutes away by Ginza line.Room nice and clean but after 10 years updating is needed; we ve liked Andaz better in terms of size, views, bed, pillows, nespresso coffee machine, complimentary water and juices, the large shower, the deep soaking bathtub..Breakfast, however, stands out from any other hotel in town at Keshiki –service, especially, kudos-. The small but well arranged buffet is everything but standard with many selected Japanese foods like honey, ketchup, artisanal balsamic vinegar and soy sauces. Pastries also outstanding -better than Paris-. Perhaps only cheeses were quite average. Do not miss their delicious eggs benedict: 2 farm eggs on one English muffin with asparagus and king crab, which come with the buffet.A special mention goes to Nicolo, the Italian gentleman overseeing the restaurant, all the times truly outstanding at guiding and directing his few staff when the restaurant is literally overflowing of guests: better to go there before 8 or after 9 30 for a nicer table –but again service is super efficient even at peak times, truly rare in Japan-. They also offer a breakfast menu at the Tapas lounge on the same floor which is not as impressive: eggs benedict with lobster and pancake were nice but service slow and a bit on the slack side that day, we thought.Check out was also busy and it took some time but altogether another great stay. See you again before Christmas.","Hong Kong, China","planetjanet733</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",11,4.0

Hotel is at an excellent location. Shopping areas and restaurants are within walking distance, in addition to excellent streets to take long walks. At the Basement there is a Tokyo Underground Metro Station and some restaurants. Staff is very friendly and always take initiative to offer assistance. One night I had a headache and a staff member noticed that without me telling her that I was kind of disoriented, she approached me and walked me to my room which was about three floors down. Hotel is very secure, we liked that so much. There are two restaurants that serve breakfast buffets but guests can also ask for item(s) if not included in the buffet. In fact I was impressed with the friendly atmosphere restaurant staff members were demonstrating. Thanks to Raul Levis, Director of Rooms and Takehiro Hosoi, Senior Hotel Assistant Manager, Both demonstrated their care by always asking us about our comments and needs to ensure that our stay would be pleasant and relaxing. Niccolo Brachelente, K’shiki Restaurant Breakfast Manager always took extra steps to serve us in a very professional yet friendly way by following up on us when we were having our breakfast, he would always offer his readiness to have anything prepared for us without us even asking. We will definitely go back to this hotel when we visit Tokyo.","Dhahran, Saudi Arabia","A B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dhahran, Saudi Arabia</strong>",38,5.0

The hotel is beautiful and the room was large, new and clean. The bathroom was exceptional, especially the giant tub and the awesome heated toilets. The bed seemed a bit small and the nightstands had a lot of sharp corners (which matters when you are traveling with a 1 year old). I was kind of annoyed by the placement of the lobby and the need to take multiple elevators everywhere.Our experience was a bit mixed because we felt the service was mixed. Two of the staff members were exceptional and really went out of their way to help us when we had questions or requests (unfortunately I lost the paper where I wrote down their names). One porter even walked us all the way to the subway and helped us to buy our tickets. But I was pretty disappointed in the concierge on more than one occasion. One person really could not speak English (and I don't think I'm being a whiny American when I am traveling to a luxury hotel in a major metropolis and the person I am speaking to is in a role that means he or she needs to interact mainly with tourists and out-of-towners), one person had no clue how to give us directions to the Tsukiji Fish Market (a nearby, major attraction) and the last person recommended a very smoky (not to mention far away) restaurant to us for our dinner reservation when she knew we were bringing a baby.The quality of the room service food was amazing but we did need to wait an insane amount of time (nearly 2 hours) when ordering at dinnertime on a Sunday.I think this hotel is more geared toward business travelers - I would return on business but perhaps not on a leisure trip.","New York City, New York","guest81256</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",37,3.0

The concierge arranged 3 other restaurant reservations for me and they were top notch as well. in addition they provided suggestions to purchase souvenirs and Japanese sweets. They even showed me pics of the sweets i need to be looking for while at the store. Their maps for restaurant was the most exhaustive i saw- it showed the forms of payment accepted at that restaurant. Since in japan some restaurants;even fine dining; still use cash or add surcharge on credit cards; this was extremely valuable. The room was nice except that i am not a fan of open showers. The shower head at times can be at an angle when you turn on the water and it gets into main room which can be a pain.Breakfast at buffet restaurant & ala-carte restaurant was excellent. You can't beat view of Mt Fuji from restaurant :). I found service at restaurant overwhelming when they would request to bring the milk & cereals you selected to the table but totally appreciated their service when they bought a spoon for me to eat the yogurt i had picked. i had not picked spoon to eat yogurt- the server noticed that and without my mentioning brought it for me.

Pity. This could be a great company, and the Tokyo hard product has so much to work with: nice rooms, fabulous views, excellent breakfasts, and good location. But, that's where the good news stops. Service wise, from housekeeping to front desk, they dropped the ball again and again. I have absolutely no idea why all three locations (Tokyo, Bangkok, and Hong Kong) respond to all interactions with a superior attitude, as if they're doing us a favor by responding to our questions or requests. Plus, I was always waiting in line for assistance even though there were several staff members available, yet the moment my husband walked up they jumped all over him. I'm the one who booked the rooms, I was the one who was paying. Very short sighted regardless of cultural norms. You know, maybe upper management should go spend a week or two at Vana Malsi Resorts in India to learn about true customer service. If I were to base this review strictly on the service team (apart from the restaurant servers who were very good), I would be rating this a one star property. There's so much potential, it's a shame, especially since Tokyo is full of great hotels. Actually, we had outstanding service at the Four Seasons just a few days prior to our stay at Mandarin.

Located on top of a bustling Metro Station, adjacent to the signature Mitsukoshi Store and opposite many dining establishments, The Mandarin Oriental should be your 1st choice of Hotel in Tokyo.Right from the minute our taxi arrived at the entrance of the Hotel, every time we left or returned to the Hotel, at literally every turn in the Hotel, we were greeted warmly and treated like royalty. The moment we opened our room on the 1st day of our stay, we were surprised to be greeted with cake slices, chilled Japanese tea and a fruit pizza for our kids (disguised in an actual pizza delivery box)!Even though we stayed in the Hotel's base category room, no compromises were made. The room was spacious- comfortably accommodating myself, my husband, our 2 children (14&9 yrs) and an extra bed! The huge picture windows offered the best views of Tokyo 24/7 (especially the Sky Tree). The more than generous bathroom area with bath tub, rain shower and quality toiletries ensured we were relaxed and refreshed every day. The best part is that housekeeping refreshes your room, twice a day and puts in a lavender essence every evening, to ensure restful slumber.The delicious and varied breakfast buffet we were treated to daily was top notch with smiling servers and tables that offered bird's eye views of the Tokyo Station with high speed Shinkansen trains zooming in and out at frequent intervals! As Tokyo is a city with many interesting aspects, a hotel with good concierge services is a must, to help you plan your day. In the case of this Hotel, I would give the Concierges an A++! There was an instance when we were in a store and my daughter wanted something that was out of stock, I immediately called Mandarin Oriental's Head Lady Concierge who literally within minutes located another store in our vicinity that had the product, reserved it for us and ensured I found the store and managed to pick it up, all in a span of half an hour, directing me the whole while on my cellphone!On the last day of our stay, we celebrated my Birthday. After an enjoyable day in the city, I got the biggest surprise when I returned to our room-the Hotel Staff had covered the walls with streamers and banners. The room's writing desk had hand written greeting cards from them, 4 party hats, candles, matches, 4 plates, 4 cutlery sets and a huge delicious freshly baked cake. What a way to end our stay!But the true icing on the cake was seeing elusive Mount Fuji on the last day of our stay from one of the Lobby's picture windows!We have stayed in many good Hotels during our travels, but for the first time we have experienced an Hotel that made us want to quickly finish with our day in the city, and return to its environs and our comfortable, beautiful room.----Felicia Variava Albert, Managing DirectorPS: A special mention must be made of Sammy Satomi Kashima from the Hotel's Front Desk, do ask for her when you visit.

So off we went on a new AA 787 in biz class. What a great flight by the way. When we arrived in Tokyo the MO had a limo waiting at Narita which quickly whisked us to the hotel. Upon arrival, we went to the Sushi restaurant and, well, I thought I was a sushi expert, but their sushi bar was beyond belief, basically a Michelin 3 Star restaurant experience. They were making wasabi right in front of us on a piece of shark skin. The tuna selection was amazing and the sake was rare,unobtainable and delicious. Our rooms had a great view, and were ultra clean and comfortable. As newbies to Tokyo, we relied on the concierge to arrange for private tours with an english speaking guide. Well they, again hit a home run with our guides as we went to the Tuna auction at 3am and toured off the beaten tourist track neighborhoods and experienced an authentic tea ceremony in an area of hidden gardens where the bonsai trees were hundreds of years old. But wait!!! then we wanted to take the bullet train to Kyoto for the day and they arranged a guide to meet us there which of course was essential as she took us to temples and the bamboo forest and a fantastic non-tourist lunch. However, on the way to Kyoto, the MO bell staff sent a super nice young man to the train station with us and he took us to our train and the specific car and made sure we were seated in OUR seats before he left the station. This attention to detail was over the top. The MO Tokyo staff went OUT OF THEIR WAY 24-7 to make sure we made the most of our time in Tokyo and made sure our experiences were FIRST CLASS and unforgettable. The facilities, from the bar, to the restaurants, from breakfast to dinner catered to our picky tastes. The spa was 2nd to none and the wine cellar was superbly stocked. We had a bottle of Ai from Kenzo in Napa Valley on our final night. We put our trust in the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo staff and they exceeded absolutely ALL of our expectations.

We spent the first 4 nights of our stay at the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo. Having stayed in many of the best hotel chains around the world (including Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, Rosewood, Peninsula), this particular stay was more of a life-changing 'experience'. From the moment you walk through the door, you are treated like royalty. We have never come across anything like it, we loved it so much, we plan to return to Tokyo just to stay at the property. We spent the last 3 nights of our trip at the Hyatt Regency in Kyoto, which although very nice, was nowhere in the same galaxy of luxury and service that we received at the Mandarin. The only unfortunate element to staying here, is that it will spoil you for life and nothing else can compare... the only one negative was that smoking is allowed on property in some sleeping rooms and the Mandarin bar. We were very surprised by this and as such, we have evening drinks at the Oriental Lounge off the lobby area which is also fabulous and smoke-free.","Napa Valley, California","SanFran35</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Napa Valley, California</strong>",22,5.0

From talking to the staff, it is possible but perhaps only 15-20 days a year. The views on the other side, are just as excellent (if not better as they're towards the Sky Tree). We stayed on that side for one night at the end of our trip.The hotel gym is small but perfectly formed, the dumbells max out at 20kg, but there is a place to do pull ups and everything is in perfectly good order, plus being the MO there is of course complimentary pre & post workout drinks.All in all, an excellent stay in a city and hotel I very much want to visit again.

I have not stayed anywhere that makes you feel more welcome or offers such attention to detail, 24 hours a day.The second you arrive, you see the quality. The finish of the hotel is excellent. The main reception area offers staggering views of Tokyo as you check in. The rooms are of the very highest standard. Our Deluxe room featured wonderful east facing views, a luxurious king size bed and a beautifully finished bathroom with wet room shower and a huge bathtub. The amenities offered are also of the best qualitiy, from the laundry service and complimentary shoe shine, to the restaurants, bars and fitness centre. The little touches are what makes this hotel great. Like never having to get up at the breakfast buffet to recharge your juice. It is simply done for you. Like never having to offer up your name and room number when signing the bill. They already know who you are. Like having your own valet cupboard in your room, accessible from the outside, so that you are never disturbed when laundry is collected or things are delivered. Like the staff placing a bookmark next to your bed because they can see you are reading a book. Over the 5 nights my wife and I stayed here, I never once had to repeat myself or ask for the basic things to be done. It just happened. It's this that makes the Mandarin Tokyo a home from home. You never have to worry about anything as it is all taken care of for you, without you even asking,My favourite area of the hotel was the bar. A dark but comfortable and luxurious area serving incredible cocktails and snacks. The staff here were the best for sure and are an indispensable part of this hotel. Live jazz and a great atmosphere had my wife and I returning here night after night. I also highly recommend a visit to the Tapas Molecular bar, where you will be dazzled by culenary delights, in an intimate environment. One of the best restaurants I have eaten in, for sure.I have seen the General Manager, Anthony Costa, talk about this hotel a number of times on TV, and it's one of the reasons why I chose to stay here.

We were bedraggled, tired and hungry when we arrived, but the welcome at the hotel was faultless.Our room was incredible and lifted spirits immediately. High up in the towers, we looked down through floor to ceiling glass at the tiny car lights snaking their way far below. Indeed, I had a moment of existential bliss watching the lights of Tokyo as I lay on the enormous bed, with a proper mattress and gorgeous pillows. A proper bed. No rice husks. Yay. And a distant view of Mt Fuji in the daytime. The bathroom was beautiful and well equipped, with a separate shower area and good amenities and toiletries. The toilet was full on Japanese high-tech, with heated seat, all manner of confusing (and sometimes amusingly unexpected) jets and automatic flush. But it wasn’t as clever as it thought it was – when using it during the night you can fool it into not flushing automatically by hovering over it at just the right angle. I was very proud of this discovery until Mr BL pointed out the button that switches the automatic flush off. We ate in the Italian restaurant: fantastic food, friendly service and great wine. The Chinese restaurant is excellent. Go for afternoon tea as well – if you sit next to the windows, you get the dual thrill of delicious little cakes and simultaneous vertigo. The panoramas from this hotel are mesmerising – I ended up leaving nose marks on all the windows as I stared at the hypnotic unfolding distant scenes below. I’m probably not doing this hotel justice with this description – everything was perfect in every way and we are definitely going to return; I just seem to have run out of superlatives.

We love this hotel. Fantastic location, directly above the Subway station Ginza Line, a short walk to the Shin-Nihonbashi JR station, Coredo 1,2,and 3 across is full of wonderful and all kinds of dining options. Mitsukoshi connected by the subway station and right next to the hotel. The concierge helped me book all the restaurants I wanted and even made some great recommendations. We stayed for business and leisure this time. The Business Center and Front desk helped us alot with sending a parcel back to Hong Kong. The bell desk is fantastic. Housekeeping is professional and anytime we needed something, they would provide it and bring to our room in minutes. Absolutely perfect stay. Quiet, and beautiful. Excellent Service. Luxurious. Will return again during our next visit to Tokyo.The only thing that some may not like is the WI-FI is not complimentary in MOTYO but I didn't need it because we had our own pocket wi-fi device.We experienced the earthquake at 5am, and it was only a few seconds.

In fact, I had a chance to meet Christian Hassing, a very kind gentleman, briefly in August when he was visiting Tokyo. However, this review would hopefully show things that could be improved. The heat and water area was definitely a highlight as I got to see a pretty dramatic sunset. The gym was not big, but sufficient with nice refreshment (I just don't understand why female spa staff kept crossing the gym area to deliver trays with wine bottles, at least 4-5 times even I was there working out for roughly an hour, an explanation from the management would be helpful).Now to the constructive feedback from my interactions with the concierge on 10 September evening. It was past 9PM so I came over and asked for places to purchase champagne nearby. He explained that the Mitsukoshi mall has closed so I could only try the convenience store on the basement. Then I asked if any supermarket around as they often carry a better selection of alcohols than convenience store, the answer was no supermarket around the area at all. Guess what, later I pulled out my phone and realised there was a Maruetsu supermarket just 200m away, as well as, some wine cellar that open late in some of those COREDO buildings. While on my way, I also asked for delivery of champagne glasses and ice bucket to the room, and got white wine glasses delivered instead.There was also a popular event nearby called ECO EDO Art Aquarium, which is literally just right opposite the hotel, but both telephone operator and concierge staff couldn't provide much information when asked. I wondered and asked if there would be a long line if we get there at 10PM, and they were not sure and told me to buy tickets at 7-11, to skip the line, but the nearest 7-11 store was 5 mins away. Ended up going there and found no queue at all. I can understand if it was a concert far away, but if such a popular exhibition happens across your hotel that you cannot provide exact information, then it becomes such a disappointment.Anyway, I already had a reservation and will be returning for Signature at the beginning of October, and hope the constructive feedback would be helpful in some ways.

All of the hotels we stayed in during our Japan trip are luxurious and intriguing but the Mandarin has a way of treating its clientele that was unequaled by the others. I have already joined its clubs on Twitter and Instagram. They sent up a cake on my birthday! One example of their hospitality: We would return from a day's activities, encounter a staff member, and they would say to us something like, ""How did your day at Disneyland go yesterday?"" Apparently the staff shared facts about their clientele with one another. It was a very welcomed touch to a stranger in a strange land. The only minor negative for the MO-Tokyo is its confusing East-West angle on an otherwise North-South city grid. I had a very hard time finding my way back to the train station each day and was unable to orient myself by the compass. This must have been due to jet-lag or fatigue.

The international staff made us feel right at home. The only other Mandarin Oriental we had stayed at before was in Las Vegas, and surprisingly, our room in Tokyo felt bigger (we got the least expensive rooms with king-sized beds at each location). The furnishings were beautiful and we loved the rain shower in the bathroom. Plus, we could see Mt. Fuji from our window.We booked the bed-and-breakfast package, and the breakfast buffet was outstanding. It included made-to-order egg dishes, luscious fresh fruit, pastries, Japanese dishes, dim sum, and a dedicated gluten-free bread corner that was perfect for my wife (who has celiac disease). The staff went above and beyond in general service and helping with my wife's dietary restriction -- especially Nicolo, the breakfast manager.The hotel is also conveniently located, with easy access to the Mitsukoshimae subway station (and the flagship location of the Mitsukoshi department store).

We loved it back then and loved it just as much second time around.The rooms are beautiful with incredible views, the staff wonderful and in their Molecular Tapas Bar they have one of the finest and most unique dining destinations anywhere on the planet. Why it only has one Michelin Star (particularly in a City where the Inspectors seem to throw them around like confetti) amazes me. A meal here will be remembered for the rest of your life or at least until you find an excuse to return.The Bar is also worth spending some time in. Dimly lit to maximise the impact of the jaw-dropping views and serving some imaginative cocktails while a jazz pianist and his double-bass playing sidekick set the mood. We spent too long (and too much money) in there but enjoyed every hour before stumbling back to the sanctuary of our room.The staff are all excellent and go out of their way to exceed high expectations. We had an issue at check-in when it looked like our booking had been cancelled (it hadn't and I'd prepaid which made it more concerning) but they put is in a room anyway while they figured out what happened. Later in the day we received a small gift and hand written note apologising for any inconvenience (there hadn't really been any) and assuring us it would never happen again. These little touches are the small differences that make the very best hotels stand out. In a city with a very 'high bar' anyway, the Mandarin Oriental sits confidently at the top of the tree.If I had a gripe it would be the ridiculous charge for WiFi. Why any luxury hotel does this in the 21st century bemuses me (particularly when it already costs a small fortune to stay there) but I'm not going to mark the property or its staff down for a daft corporate decision. Yes it's expensive but if you get a chance to stay here do so - even if only for one night. You won't regret it. And book one of the 8 seats at Molecule well in advance - you can do so via their website. Their excellent Concierge service are more than happy to sort any other reservations and assist with your travel plans well in advance too - just drop them an email.","Biddenden, United Kingdom","Dr_John</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Biddenden, United Kingdom</strong>",250,5.0

Breakfast at Kishki is a must. wear the kimono in the room. use the spa.Without doubt - the best experience I've had in a hotel of its kind. We stayed for 9 nights, and it is too easy to get used to living that way.Above all, I think the service must be mentioned. The staff is absolutely eager to please, but in a good way. So attentive, so kind, and with such a good will. On one hand, they're never in your face when you don't feel like seeing anyone or talking, and on the other hand - they are always there for you. And for the more practical things. We had a wonderful room on the 31st floor - with view to Otemachi station area - very urban and nice. The bed was giant and comfortable. There was a lovely shezlong that I enjoyed to sit on at the end of each day and relax in front of the city lights. The shower and tub are amazing too. A very nice touch that is worth mentioning is the Kimono / Yukata that is being laid out for you every day. I just loved wearing it after shower. The breakfast that was included in the room fee is either a Buffet style at the K'shiki restaurant or a fixed menu American Breakfast at the place next door, which I didn't even bother to remember its name. No doubt where to eat: the buffet is AMAZING. Never seen such variety of breakfast-brunch food, all fresh and of the highest quality. And last one thing: we didn't try the hotel's spa treatment this time. However, we did get to use it to refresh before we left the hotel - few hours after our check out - and the facility is absolutely gorgeous. So if you're there - take a look at the spa and consider ordering a treatment. btw - Jacuzzi and Sauna are free for guests in the morning - and it's a shame we didn't use it.Bottom line - it's an AMAZING hotel, and it was such a treat to get back there every evening after exploring hectic and hot (but lovely) Tokyo and relax there until the next-morning-adventure.

This was the second time I have stayed and I really wouldn't stay anywhere else when visiting Tokyo, It really is amazing in so many ways. The service is incredible, if only all hotels were like this! The views...WOW! We had a standard room on the 31st floor and it was just perfect, plenty of room, everything you need and more, Bottega Veneta toiletries and the most comfortable bed. I was lucky to secure a corporate rate and so the rate was very reasonable, of course if I was paying full price I would probably think that it is pretty expensive. We ate breakfast every day in the K'shiki buffet restaurant which offers a great selection of Japanese and more western foods, amazing pastries, juices and hot foods including freshly cooked eggs. We didn't have breakfast included in our rate and so this would cos us approx £22 per person each day, yes its above average but it was convenient and we enjoyed what we had. I feel this restaurant at breakfast was really the only place in the hotel where service wasn't consistent if I'm being picky. On the days Niccolo served us the service was mind blowingly good. When he wasn't around then I would say it was as good as any other hotel out there. We generally went to the Mandarin bar most evenings after dining out of the hotel and we were always greeted with a warm welcome and they always found us a comfy place to sit and relax. They have a vast menu of drinks and cocktails and with live music it was a great place to chill. Several members of the concierge team helped us plan our days and evenings and I really don't know what I would have done without them! They were amazing! The best I have ever experienced. There was an area that we wanted to revisit from last time and I couldn't remember where it was but I did have a photo on my phone of a temple in the area and the concierge tracked it down and told us where to go! Another time I had a mosquito bite which had become rather painful and swollen, the lady from concierge came with me to the pharmacy and translated so that I could get the appropriate cream. I used the spa in the afternoon of the last day, not for a treatment but just to relax in the sauna, steam room and vitality pools. When I arrived I was told there was a 7000 yen charge (approx £35) even though I was staying in the hotel. Apparently it is only complimentary between 06:30 and 09:00. I think this is disappointing, and really it should be complimentary at all times for residents. I did express this to the lady and she let me in free of charge, although I did buy some products off her. Maybe this is something the Mandarin Oriental could review?! It was a great place to relax for an hour but the area is reasonably small. There is no actual pool for swimming. The location of the hotel for us is perfect. The metro station (Mitsukoshimae) is in the basement of the building and you can access the Ginza and Hanzomon lines from there without having to go outside. The immediate area surrounding the hotel is also very good. there is a huge department store (Mitsukoshi) next door and some great little cafes and restaurants. We also visited the Gourmet shop by Mandarin Oriental which is on the ground floor and serves great snacks, cakes and drinks. There is comfortable outdoor seating and a small area to sit inside.

Overall, the experience was very good, but not unforgettable as in my other stays at Mandarin Oriental hotels, mostly due to some lack of coordination and communication between hotel staffs which leads to not a top notch service as I used to have in the other hotels of the brand.First, at arrival, the taxi driver left us at the wrong entrance, he just stoped at the entry of the building when he saw the hotel name written, and we were left by ourselves with our luggages which was very unpleasant. Two staffs at the Gourmet Shop saw us but didn't indicate to us the entry of the hotel, and it was a lady from the Information desk who came to escort us to the right entrance. After that, our luggages were taken and we did the check in at the 38th floor, it was done very efficiently and smoothly by very nice staffs. The room was gorgeous, modern, spacious and very well apointed, and the bonus was the stunning view of Tokyo (especially at night). Also the bed was extremely comfortable and we slept very well. However, we were waken up by a lady of the room service before 7 AM who rang at the door and knocked so many times that we had to open to her, just to found out that it was her mistake! We had indeed the previous night ordered in room dinning, but I called the room service after we finished our meals and the table was taken out of the room after midnight. So to be waken up the next morning by a lady of the room service who asked us to take back the table made us in quite bad mood as it reflected a lack of coordination and communication between hotel stfafs, which is not acceptable for a Mandarin Oriental hotel. A similar issue happened also after the check out for our luggages. While the check out was done very professionnaly in less than 5 min, for our luggages it was different. I indeed booked the Aiport Limousine bus tickets for Narita, and the assistant manager took our tickets and our luggages receipt and told us to rest before the bus came, and that the hotel staffs will take care of everything...Well, we did not rest actually, because we were interrupted by staffs asking for our bus tickets, and few minutes before the bus arrived by staffs asking where did we put our luggages receipts. I had to explain each time that the assistant manager took them all so I did not have them, and in the end it was ok as they found them.Communication between the hotel staffs was lacking, which led to not a flawless service as one can expect from a 5 stars hotel. It made me admit that I had done a mistake by cancelling my reservation at the Park Hyatt to choose Mandarin Oriental instead, as you are not at their level considering the service, even if your room may be nicer.I will still be loyal to the Mandarin Oriental hotels brand, but for my next stay in Tokyo I won't choose this hotel and instead choose Park Hyatt for sure.","Montpellier, France","Marie N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montpellier, France</strong>",12,4.0

Having stayed at multiple 5-start hotels in all of the big global cities (HK, BJ, NY, London, Ritz, Four Seasons etc), I think Tokyo MO wins for me for its human touch. The hotel itself is very new with a stunning view of Tokyo, very clean and comfortable space. Definitely on par with all the other MO's I've stayed. Upon arrival, we were told that the hotel provided full set of gym clothing, which is something that no other hotels have provided. This is especialy good for us since we packed lightly and didn't bring gym shoes for our vacation. We also noticed every night that the hotel already filled up the hot water maker every night when we came back to our room, which was very thoughtful.Lastly, it was my birthday two days after the check-out date however the hotel still gave us some cake as well as a hand-drawn birthday card. I know most hotels provide cakes for birthday however rarely have I seen a hand-drawn birthday card, which brought a personal touch.Overall, I was very please with the stay and would come back if I come back to Tokyo.","Hong Kong, China","Selina C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",2,5.0

The concierge I dealt with seemed disinterested, borderline annoyed, and was not particularly enthusiastic, although in the end he did find us a great place for Tempura nearby.

They really should look again at their policy of charging for wi-fi. From the minute you arrive they make you feel special. We stayed for three nights at the start of our holiday and one night at the end. Our first room was a De-luxe Premier Room which is their basic room and it was immaculate, a very good size with huge and comfortable king size bed, lounge/sofa area, desk, mini bar etc. and fabulous views of Tokyo. The shower is very powerful and they supply ample quality toiletries. On our second visit we were allocated a de-luxe corner room and although very nice with fantastic views the configuration of the rooms make these rooms narrower, with smaller bathrooms. We preferred our first room. Don't think it matters which side you overlook because you are high up even on their lowest floor (floor 30) and all the views are stunning. A nice little touch is the little cupboard near your door which opens in the room and in the corridor. This is where they deliver your newspaper and where you leave any dirty laundry for collection. There is a choice of restaurant for breakfast, one a la carte, one buffet. The buffet in K'shiki is very good with wonderful service (didn't try the a la carte). There is a huge selection and the take your order for eggs. Never seen such a selection of bacon! Enjoyed some lovely cocktails in the a Mandarin Bar and ate one night in K'shiki restaurant (very enjoyable with, as expected, wonderful service). Made a booking for their Pizza Bar for our last night (there are only about 8 or 10 seats around the Pizza Bar so you should book in advance if you want to try this). This was a great experience, watching chef Luca putting together the pizzas - delicious. Just down the escalator and you are in the tunnels taking you to the metro. We wanted to go to the Sky Tree viewing platform and asked the Concierge for directions. It's very easy from the hotel to get to the metro and board the train direct to the Sky Tree, no changes. Also under the hotel is Mitsikoshi Department Store and their Food Hall is definitely worth a visit. This is an excellent hotel but the only hotel we stayed at in Japan which charged for wi-fi.","Nottingham, England","LindaB_7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nottingham, England</strong>",60,5.0

In comparison with other five star hotels in the similar class, we got a better rate but it is still not for the faint of heart. To get to the hotel, we took the airport train to Tokyo Station and then walked ten minutes to the hotel. You can also take a 1000yen taxi ride to the hotel from the station. From check in to check out, the service at the hotel was personal and intimate - more akin to a boutique hotel. The front desk is friendly and personable as is the concierge. Special mention should be given to the staff at the Kshiki restaurant/Pizza Bar, where the service was outstanding and unobstrusive. The staff anticipated our needs before we even knew what we wanted. I choked on my own saliva and before I knew it a large glass of water was in front of me without having asked. Nicola, in particular, made us feel like royalty at breakfast each morning. There is a nice, small buffet spread at breakfast which is delicious. We went to the pizza bar a few times as well and Daniele the chef came out a few times to greet us. We had good conversations and shared grappa with Luca, the pizza maker. The pizza (and dessert pizza!!) is not to be missed here. Our room was lovely, bright, and very large for Tokyo standards. Comfort and the sprawling views make you want to stay in your room. I could sleep in their bed for days on end since it was the perfect firmness, and I like the blinds and curtains option for darkness. My only complaint is that I wish there was a door to separate the shower from the bathtub/sink area and I had trouble adjusting the different shower head options, all were powerful beyond belief. Otherwise the room is very comfortable. You can enjoy complimentary oranges, artisinal apple juice, yuzu cakes, coffee and tea in your room which is nice as well. Access to the spa pools is only available free of charge to guests until 9am. Guests have 24 hour access to the gym which is convenient as well. Where other Tokyo hotels charge for pool and gym access, this perk at the Mandarin was nice to have included for guests. We anticipated that there is no pool on site, as this is a smaller hotel, so we were not disappointed. I feel ambivalent about the location - I wish it was closer to the JR Tokyo Station but there is a subway line downstairs of the hotel that goes directly to Ginza, Omotesando and Shibuya which I thought was very convenient. A Mitsukoshi and 7-11 are also a block away. In any case, since the service was beyond, I will stay here again.",New York,"wanderluster123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",118,5.0

Our Japan holiday started at the Park Hyatt Tokyo for four nights; then skiing in Nozawaonsen for a week; and finished here at the Mandarin Oriental. Overall it was a great trip, and we can recommend Japan as incredibly family friendly, and remarkably easy to navigate. Needless to add, the snow conditions are absolutely amazing. However, in regard this hotel, we did feel it was primarily aimed at the business traveller - this is perfectly understandable, but my wife and I agreed that for those with families perhaps the Park Hyatt is a better option.The hotel's aesthetic is bold and masculine. The size and layout of the reception area leave you in no doubt that you have entered a confident luxury establishment. Likewise the rooms are large, slick, and declare the quality of their finishes. Even the shampoo, body wash, bathroom accessories (from Bottega Veneta), have robust masculine scents and the stone in the bathroom itself is cool, dark, and earthy. All this photographs well, and the official promotional photographs give an accurate sense of how the hotel feels (more accurate than most such promotional material, where reality often differs from the carefully curated images). It's impressive.And that's the thing. ""Impressive"" might be a term equally applicable to a boardroom, or a suite of offices, or the foyer of a concert hall...and it would perfectly complement the world of international business...but it's not exactly conducive to feeling relaxed.I suppose another way to express our experience is to find a word that sums up our impression at the Park Hyatt - and that would be ""beautiful"". The tenor of that hotel seemed in a lower key, the atmosphere combining an intimacy along with the expansive views. The colour scheme evoked a forest, while the Mandarin was more that of a cave. The Hyatt used light and soaring ceilings for effect, while the Mandarin used darkness and rich detailing. So ""beautiful"", as distinct from ""impressive"".The service fits well with the theme of ""impressive"". Polite, well-spoken, personable, efficient. The professional persona did seem paramount, to the point of disguising the individual personalities. The front desk and greeting staff all had perfect English, the house-keeping less so, making for some difficulty obtaining a few small items, and some inopportune invasions of our room.The management are not unconscious to the needs of children - on our arrival the room had refreshments including a cookie with our daughter's name written upon it in icing. A nice touch...but the general flow of the hotel is not tuned to the family. Only two of the restaurants allow children (one only before 7.30p.m), and even then book ahead for a reservation. As an aside, the waiting list for ""Noma"" now stretches to 60,000 names...so unless you can afford to buy the hotel, you might have trouble snaring a table.The location is excellent. Right on a subway hub, close to the main train terminal, with shopping and sights within an easy walk. And for more distant attractions, taxis in Tokyo work well for families and are affordable (i.e. half the price of Sydney).Hopefully on reading this review you might well ask does any of this amount to a real criticism of the hotel; and the answer is indeed it does not. It's more an account of where the hotel's priorities fall, and whether they align with those a potential guest.",Sydney,"RB-Sydney</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",57,4.0

Someone was always waiting to hold open a door for you or assist you with directions, etc. The rooms are not large, but very comfortable. The Japanese robes and tea were a nice touch. Each room has a Nepresso coffee machine, as well as automatic tea machines. Plenty of lighting and outlets.Our hotel package included a breakfast buffet and it was wonderful. The eggs were the freshest eggs I've ever eaten. Apparently the chickens are on a diet of roses and hibiscus. True story. The yokes turn our bright orange! The restaurant manager was the best I've seen in a restaurant. Great views, great service, convenient location.

The rooms are spacious with beautiful views. The buffet breakfast is quite expensive, but if it is included with your room it's an excellent offering of western and Asian items. The service in the breakfast is excellent if a bit forced. One thing they do is to note on a computer what you ordered the day before, so when you return, a server (even if he's never met you) will ask you if you'd like to have X juice or Y eggs again today as you did yesterday. That's a bit over the top--and I could see servers checking out the computer screen.On the downside, there was loud thumping late at night. Either there was an equipment room or a staff room or incredibly noisy people above me. It came periodically all four nights I was at the hotel and was quite disturbing. And there were some service issues. The hotel offers PJs and states that you can call and they'll deliver them to your room. I did it twice, with no success. More significantly, I brought a guest to the hotel to have an afternoon coffee with me in the room where they serve coffee and tea etc. One of the reasons people like this hotel is because of the view. We were seated across the room away from the view, despite the fact that there were two empty tables next to the windows. When I asked why we couldn't sit at the window, the hostess said these tables were ""reserved"". I looked around the room and it was obvious to me and my guest (who is from Tokyo) that pretty much everyone there were local Tokyo ladies. I asked why, as a guest of the hotel, we couldn't be seated at an obviously open table. My guest suggested that we just forget it. As a frequent traveler, it was crystal clear to me that this hotel was not treating its guests properly. That type of attitude is pretty common, but not for a hotel that bills itself one of the world's greatest.","New York, New York","john23</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, New York</strong>",260,4.0

Special mention to Fuyumo Sato at Concierge desk, Niccolo and Daniele in the main restaurant, and Rie Matsuki in Signature restaurant. All meals taken in all restaurants of the hotel were excellent, as well as service meeting my (very high) expectations. Hotel views over all Tokyo are just fabulous, whether in the morning or in the evening. Staff attention to details is exceptional.The cons : fitness room is a bit small for peak hours (early morning). One must be aware that some of the restaurants in the hotel have very limited seating capacity and it is therefore strongly recommended booking in advance of your stay to avoid disappointment. Rooms are very well fitted and equipped but some room controls could be a bit more practical (I personnally prefer the control pads found in Peninsula hotels).

Let me start this by saying that this hotel's service is like no other. They anticipate what you need before you know. From the greeting at the front door to leaving the property the staff is wonderful and knows each of their guests individually. The property itself is beautiful with the reception on the 38th floor of a commercial building and the rooms on several of the floors below. The views are outstanding especially at night when the City is lit up. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable.Now the service - from the concierge to room service they excel. For example, we touring all morning and arrived back at the hotel at 2:15 PM looking for a lunch recommendation. Many of the restaurants close at 2PM. There was a wonderful place in the building across the street from the hotel - whose last seating is 2:30PM. The hotel called over and got us a reservation. Then as we arrived downstairs to run across the street, the lobby staff met us and showed us how to go underground and reach the buidling as there was no crossing in this area. She ran us almost all the way there. And, of course, the recommendation was spot on. This is only an example of the unparalleled service. The concierge was especially helpful and assisted us before our arrival making tour reservations and to make sure we got to do everything that we requested.Next, unfortunately I caught a respiratory infection during my first day. The hotel found a doctor for me and the entire staff assisted in bringing tea and making sure I was comfortable. I am truly thankful to everyone. I simply cannot say enough.

We always base ourselves in Shinjuku, given the many excellent department stores (Takashimaya, Isetan, Lumine) nearby and the ease of moving around (via train), but the Nihombashi area in which the MO is based is worth exploring as well. The MO is conveniently based above the Mitsukoshimae station, serviced by the Ginza line. The hotel itself is gorgeous. We stayed in the Mandarin Grand Room, which was an exquisite blend of Japan meets West, with views of Mt Fuji on the horizon. The room is spacious, the pillow menu lots of good fun, and turn down was something we looked forward to.Service at the hotel was also exceptional. The concierge was wonderful in helping us organise dining reservations at external Japanese restaurants, and the staff were all warm, attentive and personable.Dining wise, we had the buffet breakfast at K'Shiki - an excellent selection of Western, Asian and Japanese - and enjoyed the drinks and views at the Oriental Lounge (which has some rare spirits on offer). We also tried the Tapas Gastronomy Bar on a previous stay. There is, possibly, better food of that genre to be found in town. However, it is still a fun, delicious and intimate experience with elements of theatre thrown in, and a great place to dine if you do not wish to leave the hotel. The hotel is within walking distance to Tokyo Station and the Imperial Palace, and some excellent shops can be found just across the hotel (including the Coredo department stores). Given it's history, the department stores in the area (Mitsukoshi, Takashimaya) are a little dated compared to their Shinjuku counterparts, however, the luxury shopping strip of Ginza is just a couple of stops away on the subway.","Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","Caryn N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Victoria, Australia</strong>",112,5.0

I booked the MO for 2 nights here since I got a reservation at Noma. The event isn't til tomorrow, so I don't know how great Noma is yet. But this is what I can tell you - I arrived at 9am this morning and the room wasn't ready - no complaint here, so I said I would walk around the department stores nearby, waited Tim around lunch time and asked the concierge desk to book a table for lunch. I had hand picked a few unagi-don restaurants and asked the concierge to try to book me a table at any one of them that's available and not too far from the hotel. The guy took one glance and called up a place. He confirmed later on that he booked one of those on my list, which he said is 10min away. I thought ""wow that's great"". But of course life isn't so straightforward. As it turned out, he just booked a random restaurant, gave me a different address and sent me to some overpriced restaurant in the neighborhood. Maybe he thought I couldn't read the restaurant's name in Japanese or Kanji, so he thought he could get away with it. Wrong.... I couldn't find what I had asked him to book and I left. Upon further examination of the instructions/confirmation he gave me, I realized he booked a different place with a different number and different address. I'm not sure if the names are different - and there is no way for me to tell because they are in Japanese. This happened on Jan22-2015 at around 11am. Thanks to the MO staff, I walked in the rain for 40minutes until I noticed that the whole thing was not arranged as per my request. Maybe the rest of the hotel is spotless and perfect. But I will only leave MO after my Noma meal wondering if I will ever come back. Very disappointing indeed.

From the moment we arrived, to the time we left, everything was impeccable.The hotel is beautifully renovated, its lobby located on the 38th floor offering a spectacular view of the city. The well equipped gym and the spa also share the wonderful view. As usual, we are provided with our gym shirt, shorts, socks and shoes. It's a joy to work out at the gym and relax at the jacuzzi and steam room later.As we do not speak Japanese, the concierge helped us with our reservations and printed helpful details with a map to help us get around.All our arrangements and needs were taken care of with such meticulous detail that made us felt like home. The restaurants on the 38th floor, Sora serves excellent Japanese food, and K'shiki was where we had breakfast, the spread included many wonderful pastries and high quality food, including the fragrant Iwate honey. Needless to say, we love it here!The hotel is located right on top of the Mitsuoshimae train station and can be accessed via the A7 exit, it is just two stops to Ginza if I recall correctly.Overall, this is a wonderful place to be in, we will be back!","Singapore, Singapore","2gerald</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",43,5.0

The room is what you expect from a 6 star hotel. They are very large and comfortable in what you expect with a MO. Perfect. The only issue I had was the sleep quality. There were some noises coming from the floor above at night but it was for a very brief moment. I am being picky yes but you expect perfection here. Free WIFI I believe is only for the Grand King Room and above. It will depend on your package. The cheapest rooms do not come with free wifi... View: The hotel is perched at the top of an office building so you have a bird's eye view of everything around you. One side of the hotel have the Mt. Fuji view in the distance and the other side have the Tokyo Sky Tree. Remember to request which side you want during reservation. Service: Impeccable. This is only what you expect in Japan but the MO Tokyo take it up a notch. From the always smiling and energetic bell captain to the restaurant staff. Everyone is ready to help and assist. They will bend over and make things work for you. The only issue I had was the check in staff. She was a bit cold and didn't make me feel that good. The excellent staff that escorted me to the room was perfect. She made the difference to my check in. The checkout staff was perfect. Breakfast: I need to mention about the breakfast at the K'shiki restaurant. Perfect view of Mt. Fuji and prefect selection of pastries. The highlight was the Eggs Benedict with crab meat. This is probably the best I've had. Ask about where the eggs came from and you will be in awe. Location: If you do have a chauffeur and need to take the public transport, the hotel is connected to the Tokyo Subway network. Down the basement of the connected building and you are in the Ginza line in 5 minutes. 25 minutes to Shibuya. Narita have a direct airport limousine bus to the MO. Check the schedule because the last bus leaves Narita around 9pm. If you are coming from Haneda, there is no direct bus. You need to take a bus to Tokyo Station and hop on a 5 minutes taxi. Of course, you can always take a train. Private transport can be arrange to/from Haneda for about 9000 yen on a taxi van. A good option if you have lots of bags and a bigger party. Ask the hotel to arrange for you. I just wish I will have another opportunity to stay here again in the future.","Hong Kong, China","World_Traveler_Log</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",101,5.0

Better still I wasn't charged for the nights accommodation that hadn't been used.The service at front-desk and in the restaurant at breakfast was amazing. Almost too attentive. After travelling further around Japan I just realise that's part of the culture/custom and something that it's very easy to get used to.The size of the room was excellent and the quality of the fixtures and fittings were as you'd expect for this upper tier of hotel. The view from the room and the restaurants is almost worth the money alone, it's quite nice to open the curtains and see Mt Fuji in the distance!We only ate in the hotel for 1 evening meal and the menu wasn't particularly easy to understand for a westerner on their first stay in Japan, later in the trip it would have posed little problem.

They are friendly, professional and courteous, and respond to their customers with such high standards and enthusiasm. 2 examples: 1) My friend saw the alarm clock at the bedside table which he really liked and wanted to know where to get it. He rang the front desk, who was unsure of the answer and said he would get back to us. After we had gone out for the day and returned to the room, there was a letter on our desk, giving us all the information about the clock and where he could get it from. 2) On my day of departure, I was chatting to the Concierge about my trip, and I mentioned to her that I hadn't organised my hotel and restaurant bookings in Nara 3 weeks later. She offered to look into it for me and even though I had checked out of the hotel, she kept corresponding with me via email. In the end, she made a booking at a hotel for me, with several restaurant recommendations.I think the service at this hotel is really amongst the best I've experienced, and some of what they do is almost beyond their call of duty, which makes it all the more impressive.

Don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful hotel with wonderful service, but I just didn't fall in love with it and here's why:- Location. While this is theoretically a good location, in reality there was nothing that was walking distance around the hotel versus at the Peninsula you walk out and are surrounded by restaurants and shops. - Room layout. This was the biggest issue that I had, While the decor of the room was nice, I disliked the layout. We were in the Deluxe Premiere room and as you walk in the bathroom is to your left. There is a sink with sliding mirrors that does not give you a complete separation from the bedroom. Honestly if I'm sitting in bed watching TV the last thing I need to hear is someone using the sink or brushing their teeth...Everything else about the room was nice, but missing the extra touches of Peninsula and Park Hyatt. Park Hyatt had ice sitting in the bucket for you when you check in and Peninsula has a console for everything from closing the curtains to the temperature and wind speed outside. I must say that the concierge was wonderful at the Mandarin Oriental and helped us figure out a number of reservations. The lobby and bar area was absolutely beautiful. Perhaps I will try this hotel again but get a different room.","Los Angeles, California","TravelInEase</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",60,4.0

From the moment I arrived, I was treated with the utmost courtesy. Having been informed by my previous hotel of my impending arrival, the staff greeted me by name the moment the taxi doors opened. In the space of a minute, my luggage was out of the taxi and I was whisked away to the hotel lobby on the 38th floor. The check-in process was rather quick and arrangements for a departure taxi a few days later were reconfirmed. The Front Desk has a great view of Tokyo and I was almost reluctant to leave until I got to my room, and was rewarded with a similar view. Being able to see the Tokyo Skytree from the comfort of my room, is just a great way to start and end the day. The room itself is a little dated but still excellent. Bed is a bit on the harder side but still provided a good night's rest. The amenities provided were great, much like any other high end establishment, although I think this was the first time I'd seen a hotel provide a Yoga mat. Great for travellers who practice it. I was provided with a welcome refreshment and a lovely fruit platter, while the Front Desk staff gave me a brief explanation of the room. The bathroom design is rather unique, with the shower on the inside and the bath adjacent to it. As the shower area has no door, using the rain shower sometimes led to a little water reaching the wood flooring outside, a minor issue though. I must commend them for providing not only a rain shower but also a regular fixed shower head and a hand held shower. The shower gels and lotions were from Bottega Veneta, first time I'd seen that in a hotel. Closet area is reasonable in size and I liked that there's a small service compartment attached to it, meaning newspapers and letters could be delivered there and I wouldn't have to open the door in the morning just to take them in. A little indicator at the control panel near the door informs guests when something has been placed in the service compartment. I did have a slight issue with the toilet though, there was a trace of foul stench which housekeeping tried to rectify but even after 3 days, there was still a hint of it. Not a major problem though as it was not unbearable. As with most of my hotel stays, I generally don't dine in-house with the exception of breakfast and in this case, I must certainly praise the quality of the food provided. The selection was pretty good although I did wish that they had changed some of the staple meats and vegetables. By the third day, it was getting a little boring. Having said that, indeed the food was of good quality, fruits were fresh, bread rolls soft and tasty, juices tasty (not a fan of the carrot and ginger blend though). Special praise to Restaurant Manager Niccolo, who was even on hand to recommend the eggs benedict to me and boy was it a great recommendation. A beautifully poached egg, sourced locally, with a perfectly gooey and liquid yolk. I've never been a fan of poached eggs but that was fantastic. He was extremely attentive throughout a busy breakfast service and took quick looks to make sure my breakfast was going well. He was extremely hospitable but not intrusive. In terms of location, it's hard to find fault. The hotel is right above exit A7 of the Mitsukoshimae station on the Ginza Line, has underground access to the flagship Mitsukoshi and their excellent food hall, it is also a short walk to the JR Shin-Nihombashi station. This makes it rather easy to get around much of Tokyo. Food options in the Nihombashi area are decent but more along the typical restaurants in office buildings than small establishments. I was able to make my way to Disneyland within 30 minutes or so (including a long walk through Tokyo Station). Now to get to the point of this review, the service. The Mandarin Oriental Tokyo, has provided me with the finest service I've ever experienced in a hotel. Having stayed in the excellent Ritz Carlton Kyoto less than a week before arriving at MO, they had quite some standards to live up to. Well, they surpassed it. The arrival portion was efficient but it was from the tiniest hiccup that I took notice of their service orientation. Having had some luggage forwarded from RC Kyoto to MO, I was surprised that the luggage was not sent up after I checked-in, especially after I mentioned it to the bellman. After calling down to the Bell Captain, the luggage was promptly delivered with apologies for the mix up. Now here's where I was impressed, the next morning, when I was at the Bell Desk for a little assistance, the supervisor/manager on duty apologised again and asked me if everything was in order, and I had not even mentioned my name or room number yet. Then on my second morning, Restaurant Manager Niccolo, prior to recommending my breakfast order, also asked me again if I found everything ok, as he had been informed of the minor mistake with the luggage and again apologised. That was quite something, I would expect the Bell Captain would apologise as it was handled by their department but that they took the effort to try and recognise me, I'm certainly grateful. The restaurant manager following up on a luggage issue, wow! There were no words to describe how impressed I was. Besides that, whenever I approached the Front Desk or Concierge Desk, I was given the utmost attention and questions were answered immediately. All the staff I interacted with, speak excellent English, which really helped me, as I have no understanding of Japanese. When I was shopping at Sembikiya Fruit Store in the same building, I had difficulty communicating my concerns to the staff there, so I walked over to MO and asked the Bell Desk if they could get a staff to assist me for a few minutes. Immediately they sprung into action and within 30 seconds, they pulled a member of staff over to follow me to the store and help me translate. One of the concierge on the Night shift, was also extremely helpful in assisting me. She helped me make arrangements for a package to be sent to Hong Kong and liaised with the Business Centre on my behalf as well as kept her colleagues updated. Unfortunately I forgot the note down her name but I was again very grateful.I cannot stress enough, how good the service was. I did not want to leave the hotel when it came time to check out. The Mandarin Oriental Tokyo deserves every bit of praise they get and more. At the side entrance to the hotel, there sits a plaque on both sides of the door, stating that they are a 6 Diamond award winner from The American Academy of Hospitality Sciences. I'm not sure what the highest rating is, but as far as I'm concerned, 6 is not enough. One thing is for sure, I hope to go back to Tokyo soon and I already know where I'm staying.","Singapore, Singapore","Daryllee84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",43,5.0

Half Business trip and half relaxing getaway trip. We always try to stay at the Peninsula Hotel or the Imperial Hotel. This time, it was a very last minute arrangement, for some reason, 95% of the hotels in Tokyo that are of this category are full. Unbelievable.Luckily, after many tries, my travel agent found ONE last room at the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo for us. I read the reviews, and didn't hesitate to book it. This hotel is so beautiful. We didn't want to leave. Next time we visit Tokyo, we will definitely stay here again.The location is in a quieter area. But because it is right above the Metro Ginza Line, everywhere we wanted to go was so convenient. Mitsukoshi department store is next door. There are plenty of restaurants around it, lots of convenience stores, number of coffee shops, airport limousine bus stops right in front of the main entrance. We took the NEX from Narita, arrived by 930pm, it took 5 minutes by taxi from Tokyo Station to get to the hotel. The hotel's check in lobby is on the 38th floor. Stunning view at night and in the day time. You can see the Skytree! Upon our arrival, the staff and bell captain took care of our luggage, and took us to the 38th floor. Check in was smooth, and the concierge was fantastic. I requested some restaurants that are michelin starred for reservations by email. She confirmed my reservations, and arranged all the confirmation papers, and maps for us upon our check in. Our room was on the 35th floor. Nothing to complain about. Beautiful. Love it. EXCEPT.... the pillows are TOO soft for our preference. Asked for harder pillows, gave us the memory foam kind, it was fine. Bottega Veneta Amenities in the bathroom. Love the fluffy slippers. Bottled water provided daily. King Size bed.The only complain is yes, they charge for Wi-Fi. So, before we arrived, I ordered a pocket wifi device from Rentafone Japan to deliver to our room. It was great to have everywhere in Tokyo. Often even in subways, on roaming, there is no signal from Docomo. So it was great to have it.I left by airport limousine bus to Narita early at 625am. Nothing was opened for coffee or breakfast. As I waited for my bus to arrive in the main entrance. The bell captain took care of my bags and luggage. There was a table of goodies like pastries, and coffee, tea or water for guests waiting. That is very considerate. As I waited, the bell captain offered me fresh towel, and newspaper. The bus arrived on time, and I was sent off by the staff with utmost professional manner and politeness. I arrived at Narita airport in about 1 hour and 15 minutes.Thank you Mandarin Oriental Tokyo, we will return very soon.","Hong Kong, China","Katetam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",343,5.0

Fuji from both my room (31st floor) and from the restaurants (38th floor). On a cloudy day and at night views of the city were spectacular. Being above both the rail lines and the major freeway, I was entertained without having any noise to interrupt this serenity.The staff was more gracious than one could imagine. All that deep bowing, running to hold an elevator, knowing my name at the front desk, the restaurants and in the downstairs lobby where you wait for taxis. But these next two situations explain why I felt cared for in a foreign country.As a woman traveling alone, I appreciate the fact the Mandarin Oriental always sends another woman for whatever needs I have. When I arrived, I realized I had come away without some of my medication. I made a list of what I was missing and took it down to the front desk, asking for help. They made some calls and had a young member of staff accompany me and to serve as translator to both the doctor's office and then to the pharmacy, both of which were in the same building. We spent at least 2 hours together. And it was delightful to be with a Japanese woman who, although part of the staff of this hotel, was filling me with conversation about Japanese home life.  And then I misplaced the 2 rings. And even though when I took them off after I returned to the room from breakfast, I couldn't find them when I was ready to leave the room for lunch. The front desk sent a woman immediately to help me look. Nothing. We looked high and low, on every surface top, in the bathroom, in the drawers. She left to check the waste baskets which were emptied during that time. When came back with another woman,they stripped the bed, used flash lights under/behind/above furniture.  We became desperate, and then they found the rings behind an assortment of boxes on top of the refrigerator. The three of us had tears and hugs all around. They didn't give up, even though I had. Both of these situations were my fault. But I was never made to feel foolish, thanks to all those quality people at the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo.

One of the restaurants didn't take reservations for another 2-3 weeks after my original email to the MO. I called the hotel on the day the reservations opened and they were already on it. Overall the staff is trained really well. There is ALWAYS someone around every corner in case you need something. My least favorite thing, and it is more of a MO thing and not just Tokyo, is that getting to your room from the street requires two elevators. This allows he lobby to have that wow factor but after a while it gets somewhat annoying.The location is nice in that you can get out and walk to interesting places. Tokyo is very spread out so as a tourist you're going to be getting in a taxi or public transportation to see other things.

After a few days there, I stopped being quite as stunned each time I walked by, but when we checked it, I could hardly concentrate as the city spread out in the distance from the giant windows behind the check in desk.Great location and on the top floors of the building that has a subway stop in it. We used the subway to get everywhere. It was very easy to use once you figured it out. We did download an app on our phone though because there are so many subway lines, it is hard to know how to get from point A to point B. Our room was amazing with similarly amazing views. We didn't us the concierge often but they were very helpful when we did ask them our couple of questions.Not sure if I have ever stayed in a hotel that high, but it was pretty cool. Also a great location in the middle of town. For a moment in time, we had looked at staying a the Park Hyatt and I would recommend the Mandarin Oriental over the Park Hyatt. The Park Hyatt is way on the west side of town and doesn't have a convenient subway stop and the subway is definitely a shockingly easy way to get basically everywhere.","Dallas, Texas","TripFan045</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",78,5.0

Most buildings in Tokyo are relatively low due to the risk of earthquake. Not so The Mandarin. Its a giant in the area and therefore had incredible views across the city.As you check in, the views behind reception are breathtaking. We stayed on the 36th floor (2 down from reception) and we just stood and looked out of the window for about 10 minutes.The hotel itself is on a very busy main street, but of course very quiet due to the height. It's a bustling neighbourhood with its of top quality shops and restaurants. Even the fan shop that designed The Mandarin logo is only a couple of hundred meters away! I also strongly recommend Zohiko, a shop of the Japanese lacquer company established in 1661, which is just across the road from the hotel. Beautiful stuff and a great thing to take home to remind you of your trip and Japanese culture.The room itself has everything you expect of a Mandarin property and we liked the darker wood and bathroom used here than the brighter, more modern look at The Peninsula where we had stayed a few days earlier.The bar has amazing views in the evening. We eventually managed to get a window table and it was perfect. Apart from the smoke! They have to do something about smoking in bars and restaurants in Japan.Also, you have to pay for WiFi!!! Really? In this day and age? About £3 for an hour or £12 for 24.Apart from these annoying distractions we actually thought it had the edge on The Peninsula which is a shame! We spent 4 days at The Peninsula and only 1 at The Mandarin.My 2 cents? Go for The Mandarin, although of course, neither will disappoint.Oh, and a special mention for the lady at The Concierge desk at The Mandarin. She was excellent and sent us to the best beef restaurant and meal that I have ever.

Top notch service and staff, fab breakfast, doesn't really set a foot wrong. Had one dinner at Sushi Sora, which was really great. English speaking chefs prepare everything in front of you and explain what they're giving you, which adds to the experience (some meals in Japan we didn't really know what we were eating, which is fun in a different way). It will also go down in my personal history as the place in which my eyes and tastebuds were awakened to the good sake. I was offered six to try before picking one - all were very different, all delicious, and all unlike anything I'd ever had before.

I had never experienced anything like it before. The staff member that checked me in was very kind, and walked me around to give me a tour, and walked me all the way to my room and inside. Being new to Japan, I tried to tip her but she refused to take it very politely. The level of English of the staff is much better than other high end hotels in the area.To give another example of the high level of service: One morning I had breakfast in one of the restaurants and ordered an egg white omelet with asparagus. The next morning, I ate in the other restaurant that serves breakfast, and the server there asked me if I would like an egg white omelet with asparagus! Keeping track of customers preferences between multiple restaurants goes above and beyond expectations.I had one of the corner rooms which had great views from the 36th floor. The long rectangular shape of the room did make it feel a bit smaller than it actually was, however still a decent size. The bathroom and shower were great.

No question was too trivial for the staff, and no request too much trouble.The staff that we encountered were stellar across the board. Special mention goes to the knowledgeable and helpful concierge desk staff who were generous with suggestions and printouts of the areas that we were planning to visit. We received such a warm welcome that our children didn't want to leave! They were ushered into the lobby with a selection of plush toys - both chose an adorable panda bear in a liveried Mandarin Oriental uniform. This star treatment continued in the bedroom with fresh cookies and a box of popcorn laid out, along with chilled milk in the fridge. The bedroom itself was spacious and beautifully appointed, with 2 beds that were just slightly smaller than a queen bed. A pair of binoculars was provided to take full advantage of the stunning view of the Tokyo Sky Tree from the floor to ceiling window. Another thoughtful touch was the bottle of lavender scent provided at turn down. The bathroom was large and well laid out. The unique Japanese WC experience was new for our kids and they couldn't get over the washing feature and the warm toilet seat. What a joy to come back to the large bath tub with bath pillows after a long day of exploring Tokyo. In-room dining was impeccable - the noodles with vegetable tempura, corn soup and macaroni and cheese that we ordered were delicious. The variety and quality of the food at the buffet breakfast was likewise excellent. Upon hearing that we were vegetarian, the gracious manager arranged for vegetarian noodles to be prepared for us. The solicitous and polite service received was most appreciated. The location of the hotel in a business district suited us just fine. We found it convenient to take a taxi to/from Tokyo Station when using the subway system, or to use the Mitsukoshimae station in the basement when using the line going to Shibuya. Taxis can be found waiting along the road next to Mitsukoshi, which is just next to the tower that houses MOTYO.

This was my first visit to Tokyo. I have always heard that Asian luxury properties were amazing; in the case of the Mandarin, this is absolutely true. I have stayed in a number of luxury hotels in the states, but this was more than a step above.  The staffs in the hotel and the restaurants I ate in were incredibly accommodating without being intrusive. I was very pleased at the way they anticipated what I needed. The house keeping staff did an incredible job, with little touches like putting a book mark in a Lonely Planet guide that I had left out. The room was immaculate. One thing in particular that I liked was the hotel and room smelled very nice, without being over powered by heavy scents. My room, 3525, was beautiful. I wanted to take the bathroom home with me! The tub was decadently deep. The shower had both an overhead ""rain"" head and a regular shower head, along with a hand held attachment. Yes, what they say about Japanese toilets is true! The bed was beautiful, the linens exquisite. I toured several hotels in Tokyo (I am a travel consultant), and the room size at the Mandarin is much larger than the typical luxury hotel in Tokyo.

Every time I have stayed at one of the properties, I have been rewarded with absolutely exceptional service, stunning facilities, and unforgettable experiences. The brand is strong and consistent across the board, and Tokyo is no exception.This was my first trip to Japan, and though I have limited knowledge of Mandarin Chinese (useful for signs!) I know zero Japanese, so I was a little bit overwhelmed while planning the trip. The Mandarin truly put us at ease:(1) Before arriving, I sent an email to the concierge to have them help me make restaurant reservations and other bookings. Not a problem. When we checked into the hotel, they provided us with detailed information about our reservations and directions on how to get there. (2) Checking-in, we were greeted warmly by reception, who also personally walked us to the room and explained al of the amenities and features of the hotel in general and our room specifically.(3) The room was incredible. It was spacious with unbelievable views over Tokyo. The bathroom was small, but still had enough space for a separated toilet, a full bath/jacuzzi, and a shower. The amenities were fantastic—they provide you with hair brushes, head bands to keep the hair out of your face while you wash, toothbrushes & toothpaste, mouthwash, etc. Turn down service was also great. They provide you with a fresh bucket of ice and purified water in your kettle, complementary bottles of water, as well as some chocolates on your nightstand.(4) The beds were superb. I slept like a baby the first night there, despite the jet lag. (5) The fitness center was great. Opened 24 hours, I would come down here bright and early in the morning to enjoy a quick morning workout while enjoying the sunrise. Fresh juices and fruits are also provided to you for a rewarding post-workout snack.(6) Restaurants and lounge are superb. We ate at the Tapas Molecular bar our first night, which was an incredible experience. The food was fantastic, but more importantly, our chefs had so much personality and truly felt passionate about what they prepared that they made the guests feel truly at ease and have a joyful experience. We also enjoyed afternoon tea here a couple of days, which is an incredible experience as well. The desserts are delectable and the service is exceptional.(7) Excellent spa facilities and wonderful service. I received the Aromatherapy Associates facial while I was there, and I was absolutely glowing afterwards. I was surprised at how great my skin looked for the next few days! The specialist doing my facial was very professional and kind, and she also gave me a great massage while I was wearing my masks. Facilities are beautiful as well, as are the amenities provided for you. Very expensive though--much more than I would pay in the US, and if you are expecting extractions, it doesn't seem like this is what they do for facials.Only downside is location. It was at least 20-25 minutes to many of the prime tourist and shopping areas (with the exception of Tsukiji, which is relatively close). However, you're on the Ginza subway line at Mitsukoshimae Station, which makes it pretty convenient to get to the Sensoji temple at Asakusa station or Shibuya and Harajuku going the other direction. To get to Shinjuku, you can take the JR trains from the Kanda station or take the Ginza metro and switch trains.","San Francisco, California","ntwinkly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",22,5.0

As usual with Mandarin Oriental rooms are beautiful, chic and comfortable. Staff are experienced, smart and fully dedicated to delight customers and there you really feel like a guest! The lobby view is stunning. The hotel location is highly strategic for shopping! I had 2 concerns that will need to be considered:1. Price was really high while it was clearly impossible to get a couple of hours late check out! They were saying during the booking the hotel was full was it was not.2. They made a pre-payment with the credit card I had presented at the reception of the double amount of the the cost of the two nights I stayed without informing me when they did it. I got the the information from the bank who contacted me few minutes after the check in! I believe it could have been smarter and professional to inform me about this transaction.","London, United Kingdom","LM009</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",59,4.0

I have been to several of the MO properties before and I have never been disappointed, and this stay was no exception. The level of service from everyone that you deal with was high, even by Japanse standards. Check-in was quick and easy. The room was perfect and the view was outstanding. Everyone that you deal with, from the greating at the entry until the time you leave wants to make your stay perfect.It is hard to pick out anyone to comment on, because everyone did such a good job, but my intereactions with the concierge, who when contacted before our stay via email, was even more outstanding. I was so happy they were able to secure a very difficult reservation at a wonderful restaurant (Sukiyabashi Jiro) and were great to talk with. Thank you. The location of the hotel was a little bit away from Tokyo Station, about a 15 min walk. This did not pose a problem, but is worth making note of. If you did not feel like the walk, cabs are easy to come by.This will become my new Tokyo hotel and I am looking forward to my next stay.","Duluth, Minnesota, United States","MatthewE418</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Duluth, Minnesota, United States</strong>",56,5.0

This hotel is truly fantastic. From the minute you arrive at the hotel the service is second to none. I only had to give my name once during my entire stay (well I had to give my room number the first morning at breakfast too, so maybe twice for 5 days). The staff strikes the perfect balance of being warm and friendly (as opposed to stuffy) and being incredibly attentive without being intrusive.Breakfast is my favorite example of this. The buffet is simply fantastic, the selection and quality is top notch. I'm not exaggerating by saying the service at breakfast is better than every high-end restaurant I've been to in the United States, including per se. The manager/maitre'd instantly appears after you sit and offers coffee, juice, and eggs including their amazing eggs benedict with crab. If you don't want eggs he will come up with other suggestions for you! When you start filling a plate the staff will bring it to your table, and if you get up they will clear your plate and fold your napkin, every time without fail. It's an amazing way to start the day!The room is fantastic, it is one of the few hotels which has plenty of closet/suitcase space so you can get ready each day and not have to scramble to find storage space. My only complaint is the closet area is too dark. The bathroom is great, amazing water pressure in the shower and Japanese toilets are just the best. The quality of linens, bedding, and other furnishings is top notch.I found the location to be very good, I did a lot of exploring and being connected to the Metro was a big time-saver. In summary, this is the place to stay in Tokyo, you are treated as royalty regardless of whether you arrive at the hotel in the orange airport limousine bus or a Ferrari.","Los Angeles, CA","LAXtraveler78</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong>",16,5.0

You would be accompanied by the reception staff to your room, and he'd explain the room facility and amenities as you are settling in. The room is large, with generous bathroom area. It is beautifully designed with contemporary flair and warm color tone. The bed was comfortable and the linen felt luxurious.If your room comes with breakfast, do make a point of trying it. It can be taken at 2 restaurants, the Lobby Lounge and the K'kinki. I find the buffet selection at the K'kinki to be excellent. They whipped up a mean egg benedict. The egg was perfectly poached and served on a bed of crab meat. Oh yumm..The hotel is located above Mitsukoshi-mae metro, so it is convenient to move around.

I AM A FAN! My husband and I were in Japan to celebrate our 6 year anniversary and the Mandarin Oriental was the quintessential Tokyo hotel that checked all the boxes and also one of our best stays ever!! While we didn't exactly choose the lowest category room, we were (double-triple-quadruple?) upgraded to a corner suite with a beautiful marble bathroom and views to die for. I really enjoyed the bathtub with the salts. We looked forward to opening all the window blinds in the morning and enjoying the expansive view of all the skyscrapers. In the evening, we had coffee or tea and relaxed in our bathrobes or yukatas. (They even had MO pajamas!) I wish we had a iron/ironing board in the room, but that's just me. Some people are baller and don't iron their own clothes. =)The service was impeccable and the staff were all very helpful and friendly. It's hard to describe except to note a few examples.. We received a package envelope before our arrival. It was waiting in our room when we finally checked in, and next to it was a pair of scissors. We had some leftovers we kept in the refrigerator. When we found it the next day, housekeeping had placed utensils on top of it. They notice these things and help in the smallest most unobtrusive way without you even having to ask. They never missed a turn down. Ice was always in the bucket and treats were left on the coffee table. In addition, concierge did an excellent job helping us with reservations to some of the top restaurants in the city. Every morning, we woke up to a splendid breakfast spread. The buffet which included a variety of breads, fruit, hot and cold items, Western and Japanese were so delicious. Restaurant staff was very attentive. They changed out utensils depending on your meal choices and offered to bring the items to your table if your hands were full. They never paused to refill a coffee cup or water glass.The other restaurant we tried was Signature and it's not to be missed. We had the 3 course prix fix and it included many surprise dishes and excellent service. The plating was so beautiful, I almost didn't want to ruin it by sticking my fork in the food!! It not only looked delicious, but it tasted incredible. At times, I wanted to lick my plate.. but that's not what you do at this type of restaurant where the ladies are wearing pearls and the gentlemen have jackets on. It was elegant, but not snooty. I believe we may have had the best table.. in front of the window, overlooking the tall buildings.One evening, we also enjoyed a few drinks downstairs at the bar with the live jazz band, and it made for a lovely evening.We used the gym at this hotel. We felt that the equipment was taken care of and the towels and water provided was nice. It was a good size for the hotel and the one time we were there, it didn't seem crowded. The view from there was magnificent.. I was surprised there was no locker room attached, however. I wish we used the spa, but I couldn't at the time for personal reasons. My husband enjoyed a nice dip in the jacuzzi in the men's spa locker. I want to thank the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo for taking such great care of us.

Many top rated hotels try too hard with service and it comes off as forced or fake. The Mandarin Oriental Tokyo has the best service of any hotel we have ever stayed at... Here is why: Every member of the staff goes out of their way to be helpful without going over the top and making you feel uncomfortable or crowded. The check-in was flawless. We had ordered baseball tickets from a third party service and they were sitting on the desk in the room when we got in. The concierge was extremely helpful. We had the same server at breakfast for the 4 days we were there and it is hard to call him a server. By the end of our stay, I wanted to call him a friend! Whatever training Mandarin is doing is cut above the rest. The staff make you feel at home and meet every need while making the whole experience feel genuine.As far as the hotel itself, the views are incredible, the restaurants are great and overpriced, and the location suited our needs very well. Let's go to the pros and cons:Pros:1. Service Service Service- we covered it above!2. Stunning Rooms and View- We got a slight upgrade at checkin for being Platinum American Express members(see more below on that) and the view was awesome! We looked directly toward the Tokyo Sky Tree and had some amazing scenes day and night. The room was large and the bathroom was awesome. Although I haven't stayed at any other hotels in Tokyo as of yet, I cannot imagine a hotel with better rooms.3. Location- The hotel is in Chuo, which is the heart of Finance in Tokyo. Some people complain that the location is not ideal, but we thought it was ideal. There is a Tokyo Metro station directly below the hotel which makes life easy. Tokyo is huge and we were concerned before going about the location, but having a close metro station makes life easy. We could walk to Ginza in 10-15 mins. There were some great close restaurants. You must go to the basement food court in the Mitsukoshi department store which is a 2 minute walk for the hotel. My wife died and went to Heaven in that place!The best part about the location is this. Some parts of Tokyo never sleep or relax. It is hard to relax in a hotel that is in the middle of the action all the time. This location is relatively calm at night, which makes it very relaxing. A relaxing location is a premium in Tokyo.... 4. Good Deal- this is not a cheap hotel by any stretch. Yet, we did get a fantastic package from American Express. For staying 4 nights, we got the 4th night free. Included with this deal was breakfast everyday and a $100 food and beverage credit for the stay. If you are staying for 4 days, check this offer out on the Amex website.Cons:Very hard to find any fault with the hotel. If i were to nitpick, I would say the breakfast buffet was a tad skimpy compared to other hotels of such a high level. The service at breakfast, however, was so good that is is very hard to find fault with it. They could improve selection, but the quality was high.Awesome travel experience and my wife did not want to leave! I don't blame her one bit!","Albuquerque, New Mexico","tpwoofs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Albuquerque, New Mexico</strong>",432,5.0

I have been to many beautiful and well built Hotels around the world. But the service levels at Mandarin Oriental Tokyo is beyond compare. I have said this in my previous review and i say this again Quick overview :Check in was a pleasure and a breeze.Assisted by Ms Asami Kikuchi . Rooms - perfectly appointed and rather large , even by Asian standards Bathroom - Clean and good with high quality toiletries. Large Tub . Everything you need is there . You could go there without any personal toiletries !! Combs , brush , tooth brush , razor , everything provided complimentaryConcierge A great team to help you out during your trip . Without the concierge i would have spent hours on the computer trying to find my way around town . The Concierge was well staffed with knowledgeable ladies , i was usually served by Ms Masumi and Ms Sato , and their support was exemplary , thank you. Just to give an example of the quality of service , ..... i asked them to buy me some tickets for the Kabuki show , so when they delivered the tickets to me , they provided me with the tickets , accompanied by a map to the theater , directions in Japanese , a 2/3 page write up on the story of the show ( downloaded from the internet ) , a print of the theater seat layout with our seats marked on it . All in an envelope - very professional - they think of everything MOST IMPORTANT - Drinking water - they provide unlimited number of Mineral water bottles, in the room , at the reception , also at the bell desk on the ground floor hotel entrance , gym etc . I drink a lot of water and most other top hotels just provide one or 2 small bottles everyday in the room . Some do provide additional bottles on request , but in Mandarin Tokyo they somehow make it very easy to access Bell Desk:When you walk out of the Hotel the bell boys on the ground level are always willing to assist with bottles of water , or umbrellas depending on the type of weather . They advise you on what to expect from the weather today . The greatest assistance i received from them was giving directions to Taxi drivers ( many of which do not speak English ) , so all i had to do was sit in a cab and pay at the end , Also as you step out of the Hotel they will hand to you an address card of the Hotel , which they recommend you use to get back at the end of the day 4G Wifi Router The hotel rents out a 4G wifi router which can connect upto 6 devices. This was very convenient for us to stay online all day wherever you are . Lot cheaper than paying for roaming charges Wheelchair My father - travelling with me , needed a Wheelchair . I called in advance and the Hotel reserved a wheel chair for us . The wheel chair was in our possession all through our stay in Tokyo , and hence we could wheel him all around town . This made the trip better for him since he could now keep up with all of the rest Breakfast and Restaurant - K'shikiThe breakfast was something we looked forward to , each morning. Great service and great layout . Breathtaking views from the breakfast room windows.The restaurant management was very very cooperative and proactive , everyday morning they helped to arrange some Indian vegetarian dishes for my parents . We dined there a few times too , and the Food was always fresh and great tasting . The restaurant manager Mr Shioji was concious of our special dietary needs and the whole at K'shiki team was very courteous and friendly .Had a nice evening at the Oriental lounge , where we took dessert one evening - Great desserts and Rose tea .

Nothing to find here......Faultless, Our only problem was only staying three nights before moving on to Hakone and Kyoto. we could have happily spent our whole holiday here and still only scratched the surface of Tokyo. The same goes for the Hotel which has three amazing restaurants. to my eternal regret I could not find a way to fit in the sushi restaurant. Luckily we did the Molecular Bar which is so unique even in Japan!

The lobby of the hotel offers breathtaking views of Tokyo and on clear days you can even see Mt. Fuji.We had a room on the 31st floor and the room was well appointed and quite large and had a large bathroom as well. The amenities provided were high class and there was not much I could fault as everything was as expected from the MO. The hotel is connected to an underground shopping alley with some restaurants and is connected to the Subway which makes it convenient to get around. However since it is in the business district the area is not very happening in the evening.The gym was located on the same floor as the lobby and was small but well equipped. The spa offers the sauna, steam room and whirlpool for free to hotel guests before 9AM. After 9AM there is a 7000 JPY charge per person which I find a bit much as a five star hotel should offer these amenities for free.Staff was in general very pleasant and professional and gave a very good impression.However something which dissapointed me slightly was the fact that our curtain did not open properly on one side (the electronics were faulty) and this was already the case when we were shown to the room. However this was not fixed even the next day when we called housekeeping to check this again. In a MO I first of all expect things to work and if they do not it should be fixed immediately. The hotel is pricey but this is Tokyo so do not expect a bargain here. I would definitely recommend the hotel if you are in Tokyo but do also give other properties some consideration as five star properties in Tokyo are in general stunning.","Singapore, Singapore","jetsetlife888</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",60,5.0

In the nicest way possible you have made it a little difficult for us to enjoy anywhere as much as we did before we visited you because of the wonderful warmth and sincere hospitality each member of staff showed us on our stay- it was as if we have returned from a stay with family rather than just another fine hotel. The only way to relive this we feel is to come back very soon!We stayed at 2 other hotels which will also be reviewed but this is the winner hands down because it provides practically all you could need from a hotel under one roof. The attention to detail is part of Japanese culture anyhow but at MOkyo it seems they have taken it to other dimensions from the yoga mat in the room to the super food juices on display in the gym (perhaps a little rationed though!) to the staff following up every enquiry no matter how small, quietly, efficiently and always with the express purpose to meet your individual needs whatever they may be. It is a week later and I am still wowed. The choice and style of restaurants at MO is varied, the gym is one of the better ones, the interiors everywhere are immaculately maintained, the rooms are super well insulated and this is one hotel where the room service is pretty close to eating at the restaurants! A special thank you to the Manager at K'SHIKI- he made a potential evening dining alone in a crowded restaurant seem like I was dining in comfort at my own table at home...how he did this was down to his own personal style, professionalism and attentiveness. The beds are a nice balance between firm and soft (I prefer firmer) but we slept soundly every night. Windows floor to ceiling style provide amazing views and blinds/ shutters are at the touch of a switch. Bathroom or sink area perhaps a little on the small side but shower and bath facilities were nicely spaced/ laid out. The loos in Tokyo all are the electronic heated seat type. The water level in this one was either high or somehow not right as it splashed- excuse the detail!Pizza bar has good lively atmosphere, Tapas Molecular Bar is fun to do with a friend and if s/he is less into that kind of experience its as enjoyable joining the other 7 diners, and if you go to Mo Bar don't forget to try the Japanese Mojito. If I could only change one thing it would be to make the gourmet shop on the ground floor bigger and with more variety such as maybe it used to be since the photos on the website show a different Gourmet Shop to the one actually available at the hotel. Also if I can mention we found it strange to call it a 'gourmet' shop and then have coffee available only in paper cups...it was why we didn't coffee there.Best of all the department store located 3 minutes from the hotel called Mitsokushi and its basement loaded with superfood salads/ food goodies of every kind meant that eating fresh and healthy on the go was easy when needing a change from sit down meals. Concierge was also outstanding for every request and always available no matter how busy the hotel got and we were there for part of Golden Week. On the 10th day I really did not want to leave!I did not use the spa unfortunately so can not comment but the photos look divine. This hotel has no pool but you do not miss it as it is in a district close to shops and activity and Ginza is about 10 minutes away so I hardly found time to use the facilities. It is nice that they are complimentary to guests between certain early morning times since its not always great to pay a full spa fee for 10 minutes in the jacuzzi. These discretionary touches or display of flexibility is what made it feel like a home away from home.I could write all day about how fine this hotel is but will just say that in the last year we have travelled for 80% of the year and stayed at some of the best hotels. This hotel beats them all in almost every department not by a margin but by a very long shot. Theres no denying it is one of Tokyo's great assets not to mention to the MO brand itself so I hope that any new hotel that is opened could be allowed to benefit from training by this Management Team. It has made me want to switch brands and try MOs wherever we can.",london,"grinchee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>london</strong>",207,5.0

Everything was wonderful. The room was beautifully-decorated and had wonderful city views. The vanity was a little cramped, and we wished for more storage space (especially drawers). Service was spectacular and unobtrusive. We had breakfast each morning in the restaurant, and by the second day, the server had memorized our names and preferences. He went out of his way to make us feel welcome and pampered. The concierge handled all of our dining reservations and provided us with a folder containing confirmations, maps, and photographs of the restaurant shopfront (very helpful as addresses are difficult to navigate in Tokyo). The hotel was conveniently located, directly attached on the basement level with the Mitsukoshi-mae station. Only downside was the smell of cigarette smoke that permeated the lobby as smoking is allowed in the lounges/restaurants.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin","Yvonne C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milwaukee, Wisconsin</strong>",38,5.0

The Mandarin Oriental was our base for three nights in Tokyo. The hotel occupies the 30th-38th floors in a new skyscraper, a few blocks from Tokyo Station, right next to Mitsukoshi, and on top of a subway station. Our room was spacious and comportable. It had a panoramic view of the city, including Mt. Fuji hovering on the horizon. The breakfast buffet was a perfect way to start the day. We had a driver and guide for two days in Tokyo, so did not use the hotel's facilites (outside of one rather mediocre dinner at their Italian restaurant) but can vouch for the fact that the rooms lack for nothing. Later in our trip was stayed one night at the Ritz-Carlton, about $100 more per night, and it was nowhere near as nice.

I have never written two reviews of a hotel but this place is just beyond beyond compare. It really has become my home from home when I am in Tokyo. I am not just greeted by name by many members of the staff but they even remember my last visit, the room I was in and room service now just ask me if I want my usual breakfast. The service never waivers. The staff exude a calm, quiet yet warm welcome, the rooms are always immaculate, the food is outstanding. Just try the lasagne. Sounds bizarre to have lasagne in Tokyo but it is perfect. The PuLi in Shanghai is one of my new favorite hotels but the Mandarin in Tokyo just can't be beaten for consistent, world class attentive service in a hotel that really does feel like home.

The atmosphere, service, politeness and friendliness of staff, quality of food (both breakfast and room service), the breakfast view of Mount Fuji, the well-equipped gym, the chocolates/little cakes provided during turn-down service, the extensive ""pillow menu"" offered.... I could go on. Spent 3 weeks here in Nov/Dec 2013 with work paying (it is quite expensive!) but worth every Yen. It is a dream of mine to one day return.

Every member of staff was extremely courteous, superbly efficient, professional and very friendly. The concierge staff deserve a special mention for outstanding service and organisation, and also a special mention to Daniele & team and his pizza bar / Italian / lasagne! Many of the same team were responsible for breakfast which sets a new benchmark for hotel breakfasts. Wonderful produce and care taken in the selection and catering so well for any dietary requirements. And looking after children so well. The standard of our room was exceptional with attention to detail quite unbelievable. A complete stationery box and back flannels were a couple of new items (and very useful) that impressed. The location is brilliant with the hotel sitting high above a subway stop, from which you can access anywhere in the city very easily. The taxi and car service at the hotel offer was amongst the most efficient service we have experienced. The views from the hotel are amazing and the hotel felt very relaxed and quiet most of the time that we were there. In fact it transpired that it was full when we stayed! We did want for one thing during our stay - a swimming pool. But then you simply can't have everything and the standards exhibited everywhere meant we forgot about the pool very quickly.

That night we had reserved the tapas molecular bar for dinner where they knew our names and had arranged a special gift - also as congratulations. These were the first two gifts in a total of 6 that we received from the staff. Nothing was too much trouble. Nearly everything is anticipated and just as you think you need something you realise they have already brought it.Every restaurant knew our names as we arrived.We booked massages (best we have ever had!!!) and were then given a HUGE platter of fruit to enjoy as a couple (another congratulations gift).The rooms are incredible, the views amazing.

The hotel is exceptionally well maintained, nothing out of place. However two issues: 1. The rooms are not well insulated against noise; we could hear the guests in the room above walking around loud enough to wake us. 2. My major complaint with all high end hotels is charging for Wi-Fi, I find this insulting when paying $600 + per night USD, if the MOTYO does not have enough margin to include gratis Wi-Fi add $20 to make the total rate $620 USD. Other than my two issues I think the MOTYO is an exceptional hotel and would stay again here again, hopefully the noise issue was an exception and not the norm.","Boston, Massachusetts","emannh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",105,4.0

We were taken straight to our room to check in and throughout our stay nothing was too much trouble. Our room was large with fantastic views, the bed was incredibly comfortable, bathroom was large with lovely toiletries. There was plenty of storage space and a little cupboard where the newspaper and laundry were delivered. We had free wifi but I think it depends on your room package.All staff were amazingly hospitable but the concierge staff were especially helpful, in particular Setsu made sure our trip to Japan was perfect and arranged our day trips, suggested wonderful restaurants and was so kind. We took the bullet train to Kyoto and when we were waiting at the train station she left messages on our mobile to say that the train had been delayed and to check that we were ok. The food in the hotel was excellent, afternoon tea was lovely - I would suggest booking ahead and requesting a window table. Breakfast had a lovely selection every morning & again the staff were wonderfulDinner and room service were very good and I would recommend popping down to the shop to get some lovely cakes and buy some of the delicious mandarin oriental blend of tea to take home with you!I used the spa facility one - it's quite expensive but I believe free before 9am and very relaxingThe only negative point is that in the evening the bar in incredibly smoky and coming from the UK where we're now used to smoke free bars it was quite unpleasant but this is very common in Japan & when we visited the Hyatt for steaks (highly recommended) it was just as smoky.Overall I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat.",glasgow,"glasgow07</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>glasgow</strong>",22,5.0

Tokyo is a hospitable and cultural country. The neighborhood is generally nice and quiet with some dining options and quick eats at night. I stayed at 5-star hotel and everything's very amazing. The staff is decent (ford Japanese standards) but does their job. The free washing/drying machine is also a huge plus for travelers.I requested a nonsmoking, high-floored room with Skytree view, and my requests were granted. My room was on the 13th floor with excellent view of Skytree. The room is very new and pretty spacious for a Japanese semi-double business hotel room; it even has a small couch! As with most Japanese hotels, it's very clean. Bathroom was kind of small but very clean as well. The only complaint one might have is the noise from the subway/train stations, since they are right next to the hotel, but since I are pretty much knocked out every night, it wasn't a problem for us. Over all, this hotel exceeded my expectations and I will definitely stay here again!The Mandarin Oriental is one of those magical places that seem to be from another era - its service, its location, its accommodation, its food.

I honestly do not know how they train their staff to attain this level of consistent efficiency. They were virtually flawless for the 8 days of my stay.The Chief Concierge, Ms Tajima, thoroughly assisted me with my numerous requests even though both my personal assistant (who also stayed here) and I noticed that the Concierge team is at present short-staffed - they really need more staff - the whole team remained totally professional - all reservations, follow-ups, mailing and receiving items on my behalf, etc., were done to perfection. Hospitality is usually very good in Japan, but this Concierge team is truly outstanding.Our buffet breakfasts for the entire stay were made very pleasant by the presence of Mr Niccolo Brachelente, the K'shiki Restaurant Breakfast Manager. I stay at hotels for 6 months every year, and very, very seldom have I seen any manager more capable and willing to be ""hands on"" than this gentleman (and I do mean gentleman). His anticipation of client needs is astonishing and his time management skills are superb - I never had to ask for a second or even a third coffee, these arrived just as I was about to order them.Housekeeping staff are un-intrusive and really quick. I was working in the room on one occasion during their service and I hardly noticed their presence. They almost made no noise but my room was clean and smelt really fresh when they left.The Spa is excellent. The Spa Manageress, who had served me at the Mandarin Oriental in London, moved to Tokyo 2 years ago to head up operations and it is really important (to me anyway), to have at least one staff member there who speaks great English. The vitality pool is just as I remembered it - the water just at the right temperature and the views of Tokyo city spectacular from the pool.In-room-dining always manages to be quick and the quality of food is good - there were no mistakes made and nothing (including utensils) was ever missing.Shower pressure was good and the bath-tub is deep enough. Bathroom amenities are quite good quality. Pillows are a bit too soft for my liking but the doona was lovely. Air-conditioning controls worked well and are quite fast in changing room temperature (nice surprise).The location is nice as Nihonbashi is away from the busy shops at Ginza, but very close to Mitsukoshi Department store (the main branch) and this is accessible from walkways underground - an important point when it is raining or snowing.It was a very pleasant stay as I feel that I can trust the staff with just about anything.","Sydney, Australia","Grace S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",145,5.0

The MO properties I have stayed at in New York, Las Vegas and Shanghai were all world class experiences that left me with great memories and the highest respect to the brand. Before carefully choosing my hotel in Tokyo, I found the MO to be the most attractive of all Tokyo's luxury hotels. In overall design, location, reputation.. etc. First of all, the location is pretty convenient, about 10 minutes walk from Tokyo Station. If you come from Narita Airport by train it’s very handy, as well if you want to use the metro system which is very good in Tokyo. There’s plenty of great restaurants to eat around and Ginza is only about 20 minutes walk.The overall design of the hotel is fabulous! Elegant, classy and extremely well designed. I stayed in a deluxe room which was on the 32nd floor and had amazing views of the city and the Tokyo Skytree. The room was minimalistic and nicely designed. The bed was very comfortable, and they had one of the best pillows i’ve slept on in any hotel. Great bathroom amenities as you'd expect from any luxury hotel, and a good selection of complimentary in room tea.All the hotel areas are well maintained and beautiful to look at. From the lobby, to the bar downstairs to the spa.. The hotel has no pool, but has water facilities that can be used free of charge during the morning hours. The water facilities were satisfying, very clean and of the highest quality. There’s room for improvement in the service, after a few initial hiccups. But the final response was truly genuine and of world class attention and care. I would say it feels a little more business oriented than other MO hotels, but that was to be expected considering the location. It is still a beautiful hotel nonetheless and truly a luxury hotel by all means. I’m looking forward to go back to MO Tokyo, next time I visit this amazing city.","Berlin, Germany","HG56</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>",69,5.0

The hotel is located a bit off the center of Ginza street, but is well connected. You can directly walk in the basement of the hotel to the metro. It is also right next to a large department store that offers a great selection (Mitsukoshi). Since the rooms are located in the top of the high rise you have an amazing view of Tokyo. The size and the arrangement of the room was unusually large for Tokyo. One minus is that there is very little cupboard or drawer space to unpack. The service was excellent from check in to check out. The breakfast buffet was also quite impressive with a great selection. The hotel does not offer a pool! It offers a Jacuzzi type of hot bath and sauna. The male area is completely separated from the female area and there are no mixed areas.

Travelling with two children (one 8 years and one 7 months old) in a big city and with a healthy dose of jet lag in the bag we tend to spend more time at the hotel than we would otherwise do. The experience of MOTYO starts with the reception at the 38th floor. It has two stories of floor to ceiling windows to the side facing mount Fuji and one story of floor to ceiling windows facing Akihabara and the Tokyo tv tower. Arriving on sunny day we were simply awestruck by the views. At the same time the reception area seems small and cosy and the staff is so welcoming and kind. This “homely feeling factor” of MOTYO is a great thing. Even if the hotel has many guests spread over many floors, you get the feeling that this is not a big hotel and that staff invests time in getting to know you and your preferences – and your grievances too. You feel like more than a customer. You feel like an old friend of the house. Maybe in a place like Tokyo, which can seem confusing at times, this is even more important than in our traditional go to cities in Europe or the US.Concierge services at MOTYO is second to none. And what is great is that they think ahead. If you cannot get what you want they will suggest something else and make the necessary bookings for you in advance. And there seems to be no end to what they will do for you. For instance, they went to Tokyo Station for us and picked up our JR passes for the Shinkansen and made a number of alternative seat reservations for us so we had something to choose from (important because of the holiday season). When one restaurant did not accept children under 10, they made bookings at another place with similar menu and distance to the hotel so that we had a booking option when we got back from touring the city. We stayed on the Mount Fuji side and had fantastic views. The floor to ceiling windows with unobstructed views are a stroke of genius. Suddenly even our infant could see the skyscrapers, Mount Fuji and the traffic all for herself. You can literally sit around all day and look at the mountain in the sunshine and never tire of the view. We stayed in a premier grand room and in a corner suite. The room was spacious and worked fine for a family of 4. The suite with views to the harbor and Mount Fuji was fantastic. MOTYO is located in Nihonbashi with all the old craft shops and is very close to Tokyo train station and the shopping in Ginza. We found this location suited us fine as we were traveling to Kyoto during our stay and we liked the area in general. If you prefer Shibuya or Shinjuku in the “other end” of central Tokyo then MOTYO’s location may not suit you. Note that taxis are relatively cheap and it is easy to get around, so I would not decide on a hotel in Tokyo based on location alone.Issues that may indicate MOTYO does not entirely deserve the five stars:- There is no in room entertainment system. A high end hotel must have a up to date system and up to date flat screens. We may not use it much, but it just needs to be there. - Cleaning was surprisingly so so a couple of times. But the hotel made sure to make up for that plentiful.- Key card functionality - especially in the elevator - is not bullet proof. Same goes for the elevator’s automated voice which insists you are not allowed to get off on the floor you stay!- Spa and the small pools are not open to children. Why not? The pool is open to kids at the Park Hyatt and at the Ritz Carlton. You can see that in the rules but it could be more clearly stated on the web. We actually tend to decide on hotels with pools when travelling with the children in big cities because it is a great way to create a balance between sightseeing and pure relaxation for the kids.Why then do I give it 5 stars? Because perfection is not realistic. And therefore it is the nature of and the way that a hotel deals with imperfections that becomes crucial. MOTYO dealt with every grievance we had in a very professional and forthcoming manner. And in the end it all comes Down to the fact that I just know that we will be back in Tokyo and that we will stay at MOTYO.","Copenhagen, Denmark","KK39</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Copenhagen, Denmark</strong>",16,5.0

Check in was a pleasure with all the staff being most attentive and extremely polite.

What a great choice, and what an amazing experience. When you book a stay at the Mandarin Tokyo, be prepared to be pampered and coddled. You will feel like an orphaned child suddenly engulfed with the love of Angelina Jolie.First impressions:The taxi ride from the Tokyo Station was short. Upon arrival at the hotel, the bellboy will get your suitcases and show us to the lift lobby. The lobby is not on the ground floor but 38th floor so it has great views of Tokyo. Check-in was smooth and quick; we were of course shown to our rooms and had everything explained to us. Room:Spacious, tastefully designed, modern, clean. I love it. Plenty of space to chill out on the sofa and desk. Great views of the city.Bathroom:Good layout. Not as spacious as I would like, but very tastefully designed. All the luxury amenities are there.Service: This is where the Mandarin stands out, heads and shoulders above the rest. All the staff in the hotel seem to have a sixth sense to read your mind. Or maybe they just have a very good walkie talkie system. Anyway, they somehow knew when I was heading to the gym, and when I was done with my workout! Or just before I went out for a run around the Imperial Palace, they handed me a running map, and upon my return they had a towel and a fruit juice ready for me. A little uncanny, but you feel the love big-time here. We also made a few dinner reservations through the concierge prior to our stay and it all went smoothly despite a long waiting list at these restaurants: Jiro Sushi, Ryugin, etc. They even print you a map of the restaurant, how to get there, what you need to bring or do - how convenient!One afternoon we wanted to try a famous local soba restaurant just around the corner, and asked the concierge about it. She quickly called to make sure they were open (they weren't), and promptly suggested another place nearby which was probably even better! As usual she gave us the map and how to get there, and a little blurb about what to order. Location: The Imperial Palace is about a 5-minute walk away. Plenty of shops and restaurants around the Mandarin. Subway station also very close. It's definitely close to many of the skyscrapers so it will be used by many business travellers.In summary:You really can't go wrong with this hotel. It is expensive, yes, but it is a luxury hotel after all. The better question to ask is this: Can you get a better hotel at the same price? I highly doubt it.","Hong Kong, China","greenflubber</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",162,5.0

I haven't been visited Tokyo for almost 10 year, so I planned my itinerary with the help of hotel concierge one month before arrival. The concierge is very helpful and made all the reservations for the restaurants, disney and tokyo sky tree. The hotel is in only two station away from Ginza area which is quite convenient. We enjoyed rooms and all of the facilities. The best part is that, one night after dinner, I came back to the hotel and was greeted by head of hotel butler (who happened to speak Thai - my language with me fluently - he was working with MO in Bangkok for more than 7 years). After a polite greeting, he asked that if I forget anything at the restuarant, at that moment I just realised that I forget my bag which carry all of my camera (it's quite an expensive camera) and personal belonging. I was shocked and was so happy that the restuarant was kind enough to ring back to the hotel and ask for me. The head butler (Mr. Takashi Kurono) immediately offer that he will ride on the taxi and go to retrieve the bag for me, it is very kind offer since my children was tried and need to go to the room. At last, I did get my bag within an hour. Mr. Takeshi refuses to take any tip, he only request for the taxi fees to be charge to the room. I can not thank you enough for his generous offer and services. I hope I will have a chance to visit Tokyo and stay at MOTYO again soon.","Bangkok, Thailand","busrapan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",0,5.0

The rooms are spacious and luxurious.On the lower ground floor you can access the Ginza metro line and also there is the Mitsukoshi Department store. The Food Hall here is wonderful. You just want to eat everything there. One shortfall is the location as the Ginza line is not a major line and does not go to tokyo station which is a main station. However you can get to shibuya as it is the last stop on the Ginza line.

Try the bento box, will give you a good Japanese experience, and good deal even for USD50 per bento.Restaurants at the hotel includes a French restaurant which I never tried, supposedly very good and expensive.Otherwise, a more casual place where they serve breakfast buffet, great food, views, service,... And not overcrowded, even on a week end. We also had lunch in the restaurant near the front desk with couch, good food but limited choices, better place for a cocktail or to have tea. i tried the molecular restaurant before, tasty and fun, but probably not cheap, and I tried the Chinese restaurant which was nice. The bar on the 37th floor is nice too. On one night, we left the baby in our room with our former helper for a dinner out, we wanted sushi on a Sunday night (which is usually difficult to find), went to the concierge who suggested SeaMon right across from the hotel (Coredo building). Great pick, small sushi place that can seat 10 people at most. We had the omakase ( chef's picks menu, JPY15,000 per person), a bit pricey (if you add Sake) but great experience. Our chef spoke a bit of English which helped.

From checking in, making reservations for restaurants and ease of using Tokyo's metro service this hotel was so good I can't even verbalise how good. Breakfast is delicious and tasty, the size and comfort of rooms is unparalleled (and I stay in five star hotels a lot). The staff are courteous, polite and go out of their way to help. A special mention needs to go to one of the downstairs bellboy staff (I think his name was yoshi) who was so helpful (directions, help in wrapping a screen i wanted to bring back), his English was amazing and his friendliness made the stay extra special because he had a knack for remembering who you are and asking how your day went (but like he actually cared!).The views are spectacular and after visiting the New York bar in the park Hyatt I would say the bar in the MO is far more fun, classy and drinks of a higher quality (sampled quite a few cocktails.... All incredible!).The hotel room has fantastic views, is spacious, functional and has some gadgetry but not enough to overwhelm. Thoughtful chocs and complimentary water daily. Beds are super comfortable.... Wet room and deep bath as well as fancy toilet.I never made it to the spa (for shame but this means I can come back)... Be warned that you can only go at certain times if you are not having a treatment and still have to pay for the privilege! Other than that I would recommend this hotel for a different piece of luxury. Yes it's not in the busiest part of Tokyo but its a hop, skip and a jump away from those areas.

What an experience! The staff were friendly and attentive from the first moment I stepped in to the moment I left, which fitted exactly with what I had heard of Japanese culture. The staff around the 37th floor bar and restaurant area would even remind us to watch our step everywhere around the area (a few steps around). We were taken by individual staff members and went through the check in process in our rooms! I found out later they normally do this for VIP's and celebrities, so I felt quite special! I couldn't get over the view from my room (which, even though was a standard room, was quite large), the cityscape is amazing and I slept with the curtains open! We had a cocktail reception outside the Chinese restaurant and the canapes were great, good selection of wine, and the breakfast buffet was fantastic. My only... ONLY... complain is that, as a non-smoker who is not used to smoking inside, is that from the reception area on the 38th floor you can smell the smoke from the bar area on the 37th floor. I don't mind too much, but I know other non-smokers would kick up a massive fuss about this.

We'd never been to the country before and, knowing how jet-lag hits when flying East, thought we'd truly treat ourselves while we re-adjusted.Tokyo is as vast, loud, neon and crazy as we imagined it might be, so the Mandarin Oriental, located less than 10 minutes walk from Tokyo Station, became our haven.It took us some effort to find the hotel entrance the first time, located in what otherwise seems to be an office building, but after that it was easy. Perched some 30 floors up, it has incredible views of the city. We didn't bother going to the SkyTree in the end, as the hotel view was so good. We've never been to a Mandarin Oriental before so I have no frame of reference relatively, however, I'm usually suspicious of anything that's part of a chain, no matter how small and luxurious that chain is. I was very pleasantly surprised - it had the feeling that all the decor was unique for that location - and, true to Japanese form, decor was beautiful. Our room was huge, which I wasn't expecting. Service was as gracious as we experienced throughout Japan - your bags always carried all 30 floors down and to the front door. Any negatives? - we enjoyed drinks at the bar when we returned from dinner - fantastic ambience, better than anywhere we could find out. But, cocktail making isn't their forte. Hendrix and tonic served with lime, not cucumber and one spicy cocktail I had to send back because it was burning my mouth. It's a minor point. Also extras are insanely expensive. We just couldn't justify the spa costs. But then again, this isn't trying to be a budget-friendly choice.

Normally, that wouldn't matter to us but we do expect more from MO.The room we were in had an excellent view of the city that was even more spectacular at night. Other than that the room was nice and comfortable with pleasant amenities. I thought the bathroom could have been more nicely designed though. I was not a fan of the shower since it seemed rather cold and breezy without a door. Also, the water pressure was not very good and the rain head was completely useless because of the size of the shower. The room service we ordered on one night was really excellent though. The staff member that brought it was very nice and conscientious, even down to being concerned that the burger we ordered had slide and the bun and some of the toppings had shifted. Honestly, I think she might have been the one staff member that really lived up to the high MO standards we have seen at other properties.Overall, our stay was pleasant but it wasn't as spectacular as I had expected from a Mandarin Oriental.

Pros -- Beautiful views from the room and lobby, Breakfast and the personalized service of the waitstaff during breakfast. Subway stop and restaurants right underneath the hotel. Cons -- everything else. All other Mandarins are very accommodating and they don't really say ""am sorry we cannot ____"" to their customers, they generally do all possible to accommodate requests. Here they could not give us an upgrade (even if our reservation had automatic upgrade if available, they were giving us a smoking room even if I mentioned that we had a toddler and requested non smoking, in the end they gave us a non smoking room with a so so view ), they could not give us a late checkout, they could not give us a bill where the billing format matched the confirmed rate we booked (they are the ONLY hotel in the world that I could not for the life of me understand the bill). They did not tidy up/fix our room properly -- the curtains were always hanging on a piece of furniture in the living room and never fully closed or opened (so we had to fix this every time we came back in the evening). Our toiletries and other items by the bathroom sink were never organized and left unkempt (I thought all hotels generally fixed/tidied up all items in the bathroom). Our TV did not work for the first day and on the last 3 days, you had to point the remote control literally about 5 inches from the tv for it to actually work. So I could not watch tv in bed, I had to get up each time I wanted to change the channel. They did not have pillows for my toddlers crib. For room service the items we ordered were miniscule - they looked like amuse bouches instead of main courses. Even my easily satisfied toddler was hungry after his meal. For a supposedly 6 star hotel this should not be happening.

Fuji on a clear day).- 10-20 minutes by taxi or subway to Ginza, Roppongi, Harajuku. It is located right next to the subway station - Across the street are 2 buildings with just about every type of Japense food you could want- sushi, yakitori, teppanyaki, ramen, and more- Just steps away from the huge department store Mitsukoshi (think Macy's but even better) which you can reach by underground tunnel if it's raining outside.ROOMS:- We were upgraded to an executive suite which had a separate living room area which was very nice to relax in- The bath was huge with a separate soaking tube, huge shower, and walk in closet.- Each afternoon when you return from sight seeing/shopping/eating, you'll have a small snack of cookies/chocolates awaiting you.SERVICE:- It's really the small things that matter- like the concierge who made restaurant reservations for us and subsequently sent a map with directions to our room (restaurants are notoriously hard to find in Tokyo), the bellman who made sure the taxi driver knew exactly how to get to the restaurant, and the housekeeper that lined up my toiletries and folded all my clothes for me every day.FITNESS/SPA:- Gorgeous fitness center on 38th floor directly above spa. The treadmills face out so you can watch the sun rise over Tokyo while getting some cardio in- so beautiful it almost made me want to run another mile. Almost.- The spa on the 37th floor has a large hot tub that also looks over Tokyo but is not co-ed so I had to enjoy it without the hubby, which would have been fun.

The front desk even helped us mail some luggage home as we were checking out. Our room was quite spacious, especially so by tokyo standards. The venue itself is stunning, as the views on all sides 38 floors up are straight out of a movie. We had a good time at both the bar and Sense cantonese restaurant downstairs. Tapas molecular bar is particularly noteworthy as a one of a kind dining experience that shouldn't be missed. The neighborhood is walking distance to ginza and the imperial palace, a bit different than shinjuku craziness. Honestly, my only suggestion would be to include a card to all guests upon check in to hand to cab drivers that says mandarin oriental and the address in Japanese on it so they know how to take you home.

When we first arrived in reception, everyone was professional and conversed with us as a couple. English was perfect, everything we would expect from a Mandarian Oriental. However, on two separate occasions I felt uncomfortable when I asked a question at reception and the answer was deferred to my partner. No eye contact and I became invisible.

Service is beyond exceptional. The staff at the front desk make an effort to remember your name and will greet you during your stay. The concierge was fabulous --- I had them on speed dial in case I ever needed a translator “on-demand” while touring the city. Nothing is too much to ask of them. Other hotels could learn a thing or two about service from the MO service standard. I had never mentioned that it was my birthday, but they must have noticed when they were checking us in and saw my passport because they sent up a personalized card with a birthday treat to my room much to my surprise. The spa facilities are amazing - I recommend using them in the morning when they are open to all hotel guests even if you do not get a spa treatment. If this hotel were located in a better part of Tokyo, I’d easily give this 5 stars; but because of its location I think it falls just shy of 5 stars. Don’t get me wrong, the location is fine --- it’s next to a major department store, conveniently located for many business travelers, and public transportation or cabs are easy to get from here; but ultimately, it’s located in a primarily business district. Staying as a tourist, you may want to stay in a different area. Nonetheless, this is a small detail that shouldn’t deter one from staying here.

We have a new contender after our recent stay at the MO...although they are pretty close!First, the room. The view is excellent (although with large buildings near by on the west side, we don't really get a clear view of the Imperial Gardens and the weather while we were there did not give us a view of Mt. Fuji...next time, we may stay facing the east side, which gives a more unobstructed view and also of the Skytree Tower). There are almost an endless list of conveniences...a lot of small details that make up for a great experience...for example, scent oil at turndown service. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was fabulous...the only negative was that the shower had no door. Water splashed if you were not careful...onto the wood floors.Service was the best we have experienced. Everyone was so helpful, friendly and courteous. The turndown service was something else...it took two housekeeping staff quite a while to get everything ready...again with attention to a lot of details.The fitness center was adequate. Very nice views while working out...but the space was relatively small and equipment/weights were limited. The juice after workout was a nice touch.The best part of the hotel is the lobby area and the restaurants and bars..all located on the top two floors. Everything was open, elegant, and with great views. We tried Sense Cantonese and K'shiki restaurants...both excellent! We did not try the other great restaurants because we figure our 12 year old son would not really appreciate them. The bars were great with live jazz every night. Because everything was open, you can hear the music from many of the bars. Two of the bars had fine cigars, which I really appreciated.The fact that you had to go to the lobby level to switch elevators was a bit of an inconvenience but it seems to be a growing trend in some hotels...we got used to it...it was an excuse to go to the fabulous lobby area.The location was ok...Nihonbashi is mostly a business area, but there is a small neighborhood with many small restaurants and cafes on the east side of the hotel. The Mitsukoshi department store next door is worth a visit just to see the giant sculpture of a dragon in the middle. On the west side, there is a currency museum next to the Bank of Japan. Mitsui museum next door is worth a visit.

The basement level gives direct access to the Mitsukoshi-mae station on the Ginza line of the Metro - very useful for getting about the city.Our room on the 32nd floor was large, luxuriously comfortable, and equipped with everything that we could possibly need - wi fi, a kettle and tea/coffee making equipment, kimonos, fans to take to the theatre, even binoculars.The service was, as usual with the MO group, exceptionally helpful and attentive.Breakfast was served in the K'shiki restaurant, on the 38th floor - a full buffet with a wide choice of western and oriental foods on offer, and (on clear days) a view of Mt Fuji. At times other than breakfast, K'shiki usually serves Japanese food for sharing. The hotel also has a Michelin-starred French restuarant, Signature, a lounge, a fine bar (also with spectacular city views), a spa,fitness room and pool.It made a great base for our trip.Two minor points. First, the bathroom in our room was a triumph of style over function. It looked very elegant and stylish: but the lavatory was in the bathroom, and separated on 2 sides only by misted glass, so could not comfortably be used at the same time as someone else was using the sink or shower. Also, the shower was a walk-in, with no door to separate it from the rest of the bathroom, so the water from the shower went all over the place.Secondly, the lift system is idiosyncratic. To get from the ground to our room on the 32nd floor, it was necessary to go up, first, to the 38th floor, before crossing the lobby and then going down in a different lift to the 32nd. Leaving the hotel required the same procedure to be followed in reverse, which added 2 or 3 minutes to every trip.However, these were minor niggles.

Our family of four had connecting rooms (a deluxe and corner) on the 27th floor facing east/southeast, staying for a week at the end of June. I preferred the deluxe room with floor to ceiling windows, which was more spacious and had a better view, than the corner room with windows on two sides, which was more expensive. The corner room did have an amazing view from the bathroom though. We had jet lag coming from the US and spent hours in our hotel room waiting for morning to arrive - made better because of the luxurious and extremely comfortable surroundings. We should have gotten the bed and breakfast package since we were always up so early. Staying in this location means a lot of walking - although Mitsukoshimae subway station is downstairs and Tokyo station is nearby, we ended up using cabs a lot because the distances were sometimes too much for tired kids.

I ordered a sandwich from room service. It arrived promptly and was very good.Room was very nice, clean and comfortable if not a bit starkly decorated. Bathroom and amenities were excellent. Not many channels on the TV, but I wasn’t there to watch that. Bed and linens were top notch.Breakfast, included in the price of the room, was excellent with very good selections. Eggs were an odd reddish orange because of what the chickens were fed. Hard to get used to that. Ate dinner twice at Signature, once with the wine pairing. Certainly deserving of its Michelin star although the explanation of each dish could have been better.Used the Concierge to acquire a ticket to the Tokyo Symphony and for a train ticket to Kyoto. Very efficient service.Location in this sprawlish city is as about as good as any hotel because the hotel sits on top of a subway station. The train station is within walking distance, as is the Emperor’s Palace, although finding one’s way walking can be difficult. The subway system is excellent, only made complicated by the fact that there are several private lines. As a frame of reference, when in Asia I have stayed at the Peninsula in Hong Kong and Bangkok, Raffles in Singapore and Beijing, and the Shangri-La in Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur. The MO-Tokyo holds up well to all of those although I found it a bit lacking in character. I think that might be typical of Japanese hotels, but I am not sure. If I were to return to Tokyo, I’d probably try out the Peninsula, not because of any fault with the MO, but just to experience something different. I certainly did not regret in any way my choice to stay at the MO on my first trip to Tokyo.","Ithaca, NY USA","Michael-from-Ithaca</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ithaca, NY USA</strong>",9,4.0

After, the exceptional stay at MO- Macau, we altered our plans to stay at Mo-Tokyo. As the cartoons would say.... Wooomp! Womp! The Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo was a bit of disappointment. Most of the shortcomings are in the service area as the facility itself was at least on par with others. The positives: room size was adequate with the bathroom cleverly laid out. No door on shower yet no monsoon in the bathroom. Cute. The location on Nihonbashi was in proximity to Tokyo Station and a lovely department store, Mitsukoshi, that reminded me a bit of the English Sitcom ""Are you being Served?"" The location was Not party central which is likely not what is being sought anyway. Here are the concerns we have with the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo:Service was Mediocre. met the minimum standard but certainly nothing extra. The rooms were sparsely supplied with basic amenities. Bottled Water was always in short supply. On several occasions, we had to call housekeeping because somehow, they forgot to leave complimentary bottles of water in the room. Bath soaps were not consistently restocked. A hotel of this caliber should note the unspoken preferences of its guests and adjust the routine accordingly. Noting that we never used the shower gel and consistently used the soap for the shower, even moving it from the face basin to the shower stall, one would think they would accommodate by restocking the soap. That may be too picky but at this altitude in the hotel hierarchy one expects fastidious attention to detail.Perhaps our expectations were set high by the reviews and the positioning of the hotel itself. The staff did not appear to be well informed about many standard things. If they were well informed, then they certainly could do a better job communicating that knowledge. When asked simple connection and location questions, we were automatically greeted with recommendations to take Taxis. We were advised to take a Taxi to meet a tour at Shinjuku. On the return the tour guide simply instructed us to stay on the train 4 stops further. Imagine the surprise, when we got off the train at Tokyo Station, to realize the hotel was about a 15 minute walk. Imagine the annoyance when we were told by the Information Desk that there was a FREE shuttle from the station to the Mitsui building. (where the hotel is). Now the concierge may very well have adjudged a taxi to be quicker, easier or better for whatever reason, the impression we were left with was that reason was.... easier, quicker and better for her. Acknowledging guests by name is a common ""punch list"" item that 5 star hotels check to demonstrate their ""5 Starness"" We are a family of 3 and certainly are distinctive in certain parts of the world for a myriad of reasons. It usually takes 2 times to have even unaffiliated personnel recognize us. Another small but instructive point is we were not acknowledged by name once throughout the stay.Concerns addressed with the staff yields sympathetic responses but the implications appeared lost on them.A point that I noticed duplicated in other reviews but that certainly bears repeating. The amount of smoke wafting into the lobby from the bar area is egregious. My son who is asthmatic ate in the room most nights and was kept away from the lobby as it truly is overwhelming. I am unsure that much can be done by the hotel about this, but at minimum it should be noted by other travellers who may have respiratory/allergy issues.Suffice it to say, the service we got came no where close to what we would expect from a hotel that had won 6 Star Diamond award many times. You will not be miserable here but don't expect to be blown away. The staff have clearly been trained but are unable to consistently transmit the benefit of that training in a way that benefits the guest. The experience crystallized for us what we describe as ""IN service rather than OF service""We noted this particularly with the front desk and concierge staff as the restaurants SENSE and K'SHIKI were staffed with gracious, proactive personnel. An aside On the F&B front, The cocktails neded work both times we tried to have a nightcap though the Mandarin Miracle at Sense during dinner was well crafted.","Nashville, Tennessee","BucketListedTravel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>",26,3.0

The rooms and decor are just as you would expect from a property of this standard. All the comfort and amenities you could wish for and some stunning views - particularly from the higher floors (we were on 36) - which were a sight for jet-lagged eyes. We found the hotel ourselves having braved the JR Express from Narita Airport and then 1 subway stop from Tokyo station to Shin-Nihombashi and a 5 minute stroll. We later discovered that the hotel is directly above another subway station (Mitsukoshimae on the Ginza line) but the bottom line is it's remarkably easy to find considering how daunting the Tokyo transport system might seem to the first time visitor. It's actually very easy and good fun too - grab a JR East 'Suica & Nex'deal at the airport and you'll be zipping around the place like a local in no time. But back to the hotel.The layout is a little upside down because you travel to the 38th floor for Reception and then back down (using different lifts) to the rooms but you soon get the hang of it. All the public spaces make the best use of some eye-popping views that look fantastic by day or night. We enjoyed a stunning meal at the Molecule Tapas Bar one evening (you really need to try this but with only 8 seats you need to plan for it in advance) and wound up spending too much time (and money) in their bar on both nights, drinking in the views and some interesting concoctions. If I had a gripe about the MO it would be that the bar prices are at the high end of what could be considered tolerable - the cocktails are probably the best value options because at about £15 a pop they compare favourably against a draught beer for £8 or a gin for more than double that. This is not a place for happy hours or penny pinchers and I was also surprised to be charged handsomely for WiFi in one of the worlds most technically advanced countries in the 21st century. These are however minor gripes in the scheme of things.So where does the MO really excel? Japan sets the bar extraordinarily high for Service and the team here are are amongst the best that we have ever experienced. To be fair, the service began a couple of months before we even arrived, when I reached out to the Concierge team (via e-mail) and asked them to sort out some restaurant reservations. They were more than happy to clarify my requirements and engage in a lengthy e-mail conversation across time zones. They ended up giving me some options to choose from and for one day that will live long in the memory, managed to secure us a lunch booking at the 6 six seat, 2 Michelin Starred 'Sushi Sawada' and dinner at the 18 seat, 3 Michelin Starred 'Ryogin' - a gastronomic experience that was as expensive as it was enjoyable. Not only were the restaurants booked, dietary requirements confirmed and so on well in advance (as they need to be for places like that) but on check- in we were presented with individual confirmations and maps with directions/journey times for getting to them via various means of transport. This was an incredibly thoughtful/helpful touch and I doubt we would have ever found the Sushi restaurant without it, tucked as it was on the 3rd floor of a tiny building tucked down a side street in Ginza.  Overall, we got the sense in our all too short stay that nothing would have been too much trouble for them and I actually felt quite guilty on check-out knowing that we were going to be 'checking out' The Peninsula Hotel in a few days for our last couple of nights in Tokyo. When I mentioned this to them they took no offence and said it would be nice for us to try somewhere else. I don't for a minute think this sentiment was anything but genuine - we shall see how their illustrious neighbour compares in a couple of days and whether, at the back of their minds, they felt we would ultimately miss their 'sanctuary in the skies'. Yes it costs a lot to stay (and play) here but we would be back in a heartbeat....","Biddenden, United Kingdom","Dr_John</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Biddenden, United Kingdom</strong>",250,5.0

The room was the same, and I enjoyed being in it for a lot longer than I ever had before. The view was just as great, the appointments were just as fantastic, but service? It just didn't measure up to the many times I've been here before.Perhaps I was expecting too much, and perhaps there were factors I hadn't been exposed to before, but almost from the time I checked in I was less than perfectly satisfied.To begin with, I think it's time to point out that I had been in Japan for nearly two weeks staying at a great variety of hotels and this was the absolutely FIRST TIME in all my travels that I was charged for internet access, and it wasn't cheap, either. Next, I had a lot of trouble with the staff and the service in the restaurants, with one exception, and I'll mention that later. Here's the trouble: I think if you're paying huge amounts of money to stay in a room at a hotel, you, as a customer in an executive type room should have executive type amenities in the rest of the hotel. To be told you can't sit by the window in a restaurant known for its view because someone not staying there has priority, just is not acceptable. I spent a very miserable time trying to get a good table at the Oriental Lounge and the K'shiki restaurant just because it was a Saturday afternoon and the tables (which were totally empty when I was there, by the way) were reserved for some sort of ""ladies day"" gathering, none of the ladies staying at the hotel. Another problem I had with service this time was the housekeeping staff. I don't think one should have to call the housekeeping people at 4:00 p.m. because the room had not been made up! That is totally unacceptable, especially when you're paying over $1,000 a night for the room even with the three for two situation. So these were the issues I had. Otherwise, everything was as expected in this, my favorite hotel in the world. By the way, this has now dropped to second place in Tokyo and third place in Japan. The Tokyo Station Hotel far exceeded the Mandarin's service this time, and the Hakkoda hotel near Aomori slips in just because of its great setting and service, where they go way beyond expectations. And by the way, both of these hotels have FREE internet connections!!I will have to give high marks for the included breakfast buffet which was really great, and the restaurants I attended. The aforementioned K'shiki (where they had the great breakfast) had wonderful lunches and dinners, and the French restaurant was truly elegant with really super food. My waiter was also fantastic, spending lots of time with me and giving me great service.Another disappointment was the ""spa discount,"" an 8,000 yen credit for a spa treatment. The only spa treatments that were included in this were those that cost well over $600, and added to that were tariffs and taxes that upped the price to well over $800 per treatment. I just can't see spending that kind of money on what amounts to a rubdown. I ended up having a massage in my room which was just fine.To sum up, I will have to give careful consideration as to whether I'll stay at MOTYO again the next time I come to Japan.","Kaneohe, Hawaii","Whitsiepoo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kaneohe, Hawaii</strong>",164,4.0

As we have children, for us it meant we avoided the lobby as best we could. Don't know how the workers can deal with this. We held our our breath each day while there. This also meant we were loathe to ask for assistance from the concierge bc it was oppressive to stand in a lobby reeking of smoke while waiting for directions etc. There is no avoiding the lobby because one has to cross it to get to the elevator bank to get to the rooms.

While he was apologetic, our first impression of the hotel was that of an obviously ill employee. He looked like he was running a bit of a fever as well. He could barely finish a sentence and could not stop coughing and was sputtering all over us. In a country so attuned to spreading germs with every man woman and child donning a surgical mask routinely, how can the Mandarin Oriental let this employee interface with guests checking in from abroad? #2. day 1, Housekeeping did not clean our room until our second outing in the mid afternoon which was a surprise as we left the room by 9am and indicated it via button.

The bed was perfect for a good sleep and the bathroom was like heaven with 3 shower settings and the delicious japanese toilet with heated seat.

The hotel is near the JR station the palace and the royal gardens and the Yasukuni shrine. The Tokyo tower and the Sky tree are a short taxi or metro ride away. Ginza is a short stroll on the sunday morning when that street is pedestrian only! The tv offered enough channels for the none japanese speakers.

Dinner at the Molecular Tapas bar was excellent, fun and expensive - but worth it.

Although not too sure how effective that is as the time the room is turned down is not actually correct on the one day I could check.Views from the rooms were stunning and the amenities were excellent.The Gym was equipped with state of the art equipment, and clean, although it was a little small.The location of the hotel is excellent, being on top of a metro station (mitsukoshimae) but private enough given the unassuming entrance of the hotel.However, the whole package is let down a little with some of the following criticisms.No Pool available, when pretty much all other 5-star hotels will have an indoor pool.The daily newspaper did not seem to arrive in the early morning, it appeared on my desk at the end of the day for the 5 days I was there.The breakfast buffet at Kshinki (sp?) was a little disappointing and expensive in comparison to some of the other buffets offered at other hotels. I ended up selecting a la carte menu items.No complimentary Wifi, daily cost of Wifi is pretty expensive (1800 Yen) for 1 day.I've stayed in the Shangri-la and the Park Royal hotel in the general area, and I would have to admit, I would prefer both to Mandarin Oriental.

When you arrive at the ground floor level, the staff in the 38th floor reception area are immediately on alert to welcome you to the hotel. There was a genuine warmth and empathy emanating from the young woman who welcomed me at the entrance and literally whisked me up to the top floor. And the panoramic view of Tokyo from behind the back of the check-in area is ""sharp intake of breath"" inducing, it is so eye-catching and spectacular.I booked a Grand King Room on the 35th floor. It was one of the most serene habitats I have ever experienced. Apart from the panoramic view from the floor to ceiling windows, the bamboo floors coupled with the comfortable floor mats and the capacious extra-large bed put me in a ""Japanese state-of-mind"". I felt like I was a shogun (at least for two days!). The hotel also has a number of Michelin-starred establishments, two of which will serve food (at not too exorbitant prices) directly to your room. There's also a Japanese-style bathroom to die for, divided into separate compartments encapsulating a sunken bath, a wet room with a shower, a separate wc and sink area (with all the usual high end toiletries). For social interaction, it's difficult to beat the bar of the hotel on a weekend night. If you sit at the bar, you can watch the bar tenders mix taste-filled cocktails with great style and brio. Or, if you are in a romantic mood, you can adjourn to the banquettes at the back of the bar, where you can sit with your loved one/hot date and take in the amazing panoramic view of Tokyo, buzzing with life, hundreds of feet below you.

The room was glorious... extremely comfortable, with all the amenities you would expect from a 5 star hotel plus a few you wouldn't. The view looking over East Tokyo was stunning, and despite being in the middle of the city only steps from a metro station it was unbelievably quiet. We also ate at one of the restaurants after checking in and that experience was equally amazing. My only regret is not booking far enough in advance to have stayed for the entire duration of our trip as they were fully booked for the weekend, and understandably so.

Some years later, it was a matter of which 5 star hotel would give me the best experience Toyko hotels have to offer. For me, it came down to a choice between the Park Hyatt (in Shinjuku), the Peninsula or the Mandarin Oriental. I spent a lot of time researching these fine hotels. Having had a drink at the bar in Park Hyatt (the same one that Bill Murray drank at in ""Lost in Translation"") last time I was in Tokyo and realising that the Park Hyatt really is stuck in the middle of nowhere a 15 minute walk from Shinjuku station in the middle of Govt office buildings that are dead at night (and not wanting to stay in such a deathly boring location), I chose the MO over the Penisula. I still don't know if I made the right choice, because so many reviews of those other hotels talk about how good they are. I have not stayed at those other hotels so cannot comment on them. However, what I do know is that the guest experience I had at MO Tokyo was one of the very best hotel guest experienes I have had anywhere in the world (and I have stayed at some fine hotels around the world), so those other hotels would have to do an absolutely amazing job to exceed the experience at MO Tokyo. Concierges - these guys were absolutle winners. Setsu, Eriko and Yoko were brilliant. I started emailing them as soon as I made my reservation - weeks before I arrived at the hotel. They emailed me itineraries, Japanese phrases that I requested, organised baseball tickets for me got me dinner at an Iron Chef restaurant (Chef Michiba's in Ginza - Rokusan Tei - hint, I did not enjoy it and would not go again). When I arrived, they were constantly helping me while I was there. These guys are legends. Some of the best concierges I have ever encountered. MO Tokyo should double their pay checks. The hotel itself sits on the top 8 or so floors of a modern office tower in Nihonbashi, right next to the Japanese central business district (as opposed to the ex-pat CBD in Ropponggi in mid-Tokyo). As soon as you catch the lift to the reception floor you will be captivated by the breathtaking views of Tokyo that you can see from the floor to ceiling windows all around you. Even the well-equipped and modern gym (which faced north to Akihabara) has that amazing view out the window. The restaurants are wonderful at MO Tokyo. We tried all of them and had great experiences at them. The Swiss Italian guy who is one of the Managers in the breakfast area provides wonderful service to foreigners, but so do all the other staff members. The Cantonese restaurant was first rate - couldn't imagine that it would match Man Wah or Lung King Heen (both in HK) but it was right up there with them. Very impressive, given that it's in Tokyo not HK. The rooms - I have read some varying reviews on Tripadvisor of the rooms at MO Tokyo. We stayed in one of the better and bigger rooms - an Oriental Suite. This was a wonderful room on the corner of the building with 270 views from west through north to east. I would recommend a westerly view as it gives you a view of Mt Fuji. Only problem was we were there in June. I had not realised but many Japanese people told me that is the one month it rains a lot and you cannot see My Fuiji. Sure enough, I never saw it, but I saw Fuji-san in August many years ago when I was previously in Japan. Hint - if you want to see Mt Fuji, don't go to Japan in June. The Oriental Suites are beautifully appointed rooms, just lovely. The showers have 3 shower heads, there's a huge bath and everything you need, even a pair of binoculars for a bit of people spotting! But I cannot comment on the more standard rooms, as I did not stay in those rooms. There is even a MO Tokyo cake shop downstairs selling amazing pastries, cakes and breads and chocolates. Other than the fact that my room was beautiful and the bar and restaurants were amazing, what sets out MO Tokyo as memorable is PERFECT LUXURIOUS SERVICE. The Service at MO Tokto was incredible. Nothing was too difficult for anyone. See above regarding the concierges. There was allways a friendly welcome for us when we left and returned to the hotel. When we arrived from Hakone on the bullet train, 2 MO Tokyo staff members met us at the platform and helped us take two taxis from Tokyo train station to the MO Tokyo. They are not based at the train station. They came from the hotel to meet us after I called them saying I was not sure how to get to the hotel. Now that's service!Right underneath the hotel, there is an escalotor down to an underground train station on the metro network. It could not be closer. It is in the same building. Kanda, the nearest JR train station is barely a 5 minute walk away. Mitsukoshi's flagship department store is just across the world. It's a perfect location.Cost - MO Tokyo is an expensive hotel If you are budget conscious (like I was on my first trip to Tokyo) then don't even consider this hotel. However, if budget is not as much of an issue, then this hotel becomes an option. MO Tokyo has left me with a dilemma - when I next go back to Tokyo, do I try those other first rate hotels or do I go back to MO Tokyo? The problem is that I have been to so many nice hotels around the world that I know when I have found somewhere that is amazing. And that's the problem. MO Tokyo is amazing. As much as I would like to try those other hotels, I cannot imagine going back to Tokyo and NOT staying at MO Tokyo. I love this hotel so much that it will pull me back next time I visit Tokyo. This is surely one of the very finest hotels in the world.

However I could not find a website in English to purchase them and when I asked the hotel how to go about it, Setsu Waga offered to purchase them on my behalf. The trouble she went to was surely above and beyond her job description. She was meticulous, going to the trouble of mapping my journey, explaining how long it would take, printing out my seating and giving me directions. I cannot say enough good things about her.The hotel itself is perfect and we had a superb view of the city. After 16 hours in the air, the bar was fantastic to relax in and get a bite to eat.

The concierge was ready with all the details we had discussed prior over email. Another plus; the location of the hotel is awesome; Lot of interesting stores nearby and has a very bright/fresh vibe. The subway is right in the basement and so very easily accessible to Ginza, Asakusa, Shibuya, Harajuku etc. without even having to transfer trains. The breakfast spread was one of the best and taste of the Japanese options and the fresh chocolate croissants was phenomenal. We also stayed in 'The Peninsula' and also visited 'Park Hyatt' during the same trip. The service levels there are unmatched to that of MO-Tokyo.

Staying at the Mandarin Oriental broke that habit … for good. This place is amazing. The level of service is unsurpassed. From the warm greeting you get as you step out of the cab to the flawless in-room check-in to room, the service is flawless. The staff is polite, friendly and unobtrusive and makes every moment relaxing and enjoyable. The room is well designed with a large sofa, working desk and very comfortable bed. Turn down service leaves the room ready and waiting after a long day at the office with relaxing music and aromatherapy oils creating an oasis of tranquility. The bathroom has a large soaking tub and walk-in shower with plenty of towels, comfortable bathrobes and useful amenities (particularly if you forget shaving foam!) The best part of my stay was when I walked into the room to be greeted by the sun setting behind Mount Fuji. I have seen Fuji on many occasions but this view is literally beyond description. The buffet breakfast was excellent with plenty of choices and the usual perfect service. I didn’t dinner eat at any of the restaurants but have promised myself to try them on my next visit. Room service food was excellent. Try the mild Japanese vegetable curry … yummy! The lounge was also very comfortable and served a good selection of wine and cocktails. It was a bit smoky but that is just one of those things. I’m going back to Tokyo next week and have already canceled my booking at the Four Seasons … I’ll be staying at the Mandarin Oriental from now on.","Chicago, Illinois","The_bald_gourmet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",87,5.0

The room itself was just huge and we were really surprised by the size of it after being so used to small rooms in Tokyo even in higher end hotels. The bathroom was just awesome with rain shower,a huge bath and loads of space. The design of the room is slightly outdated compared to very recent hotels but the quality of it still makes up for it. The staff was top notch, not only polite and efficient but also friendly making us feel really welcomed. The spa facilities were great with 2 separate baths and 2 different saunas. The only small downfall we could find would be location, again depending on what you are looking for.First, being in a business area, it is mostly surrounded by premium shops, department stores and banks. So if you are in for local type of eateries, there is need for some walk towards the JR Kanda station and its surroundings . Yet it is quite a reasonable walk, around 10-12 minutes at most. Now if you are in Tokyo to shop at Shibuya, Harajuku or Shinjuku then it is quite a distance with a over 35 mn JR ride to these places. We did it a couple of times and it was much more tiring than we would have thought. But overall this is just a great hotel and if you take in the size of the rooms, the view you get and the level of service that goes with it, we wouldn t even think that the price can be considered expensive by Tokyo standards. We would definitely recommend this hotel except for those whose main objectives are based in the Shibuya-Shinjuku area.",Paris,"FERU06</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris</strong>",68,5.0

Very detailed room, short 2 night business trip so that was a very nice perk. The bathroom had maybe 1/3 the space of the entire room and amenities were most complete I've seen even compared to some NYC 5 star hotels double the price. The location was excellent, a short walk to the Tokyo station and Mitsukoshi department stores. Didn't have time to do the tourist sights but 10-15 min walks were enough for a Tokyo first timer. The staff was very helpful in helping me get directions, had the airport train schedules printed out, and was overall very attentive. Kshiki breakfast quite nice, although not as massive a spread as Mandarin HK properties. The bar was pretty good too. The only strange thing was I arrived at 11:30 pm and the main door was through an Office building and I couldn't get in except from the back door which was a bit hard to find save for the fan in a discreet location. Also agree with a prior reviewer that the lifts were a bit time consuming.Other than that, nothing else seemed unsatisfactory. Views from both the room and the restaurants were amazing.

Great service mind and caring in every details for everyone on the table. Mr.Takashi at the guest relations was also helpful in everyday. He made me feel secure and providing me lots of informations about Tokyo. I've got a big smile every time I've met him at the lobby. All-day long enthusiasm to serve.

However, The Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo, far exceed our wildest expectations. Imagine being greeted, by name, without any introduction by either of us, in what we thought was the lobby. The ground entrance was stunningly beautiful and had numerous staff members available to cater to us. ""No, Mr. McCrary, the lobby is on the 38th floor, your bags will be delivered to your room, let me escort you to our lobby."" That was just a precursor. The ""real"" lobby's check-in desk (three desks, each with at least two staff persons) fronted two story windows overlooking fabulous downtown Tokyo. After our efficient check-in, we were escorted to our room on the 32nd floor. As we walked into the door, shades drew up, curtains pulled back, and beautiful Asian music began to play. The entry's drama was matched by yet another breathtaking view of Tokyo with Mt. Fuji looming in the distance. Our luggage arrived and after a ""tour"" of the room, we just stood there dumbfounded as we took in the view. But, no, our reception was not yet complete. A few moments later, we heard our doorbell. A gentleman brought in a spectacularly beautiful bento box of delicious fresh fruit and luscious chocolates (see photo). Our entire stay mirrored those fist few minutes after we arrived. The decor is Architectural Digest quality. The views, from the room to the lobby and restaurants to the bar, are like an observation tower. The huge, efficient staff was multilingual and responsive beyond belief--anytime we were headed towards and elevator, a staff person would run in front of us to push the call button, then enter (after us) to push the floor button! The room amenities were top shelf. We even had a choice between at least a half-dozen pillow types. I could go on... Actually, I'm surprised we ever left the hotel to see the rest of Tokyo.

Everything about the hotel oozes class and sophistication, even though we are quite un-sophisticated, the staff were warm, attentive, welcoming and were always thinking a step ahead. The service from the lobby to the maid service was always exceptional and came across in a genuinely friendly manner. We stayed with a 1yo and the staff tripped over each other to make sure she was comfortable and attended to, including rushing a high chair and kiddies cutlery and dinnerware to our table when we ate.The breakfast buffet was abundant and of very high quality, from the juice to the pastries to the eggs prepared to order. There are two small gripes/irritations I had whilst staying here. 1. the restaurants are very good but expensive, the food is not too badly priced but the drinks are bit too much... mineral water $12 aud per bottle.2. the hotel is located in a predominantly business area, so bad luck if you're a foodie or like shopping, you'll need to catch a taxi.Overall I'd recommend it to anyone who can afford it, and... even if you can't, it's a great experience and worth flexing the fantastic plastic for.","Hobart, Tasmania","Slash63</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hobart, Tasmania</strong>",42,5.0

I discovered the Mandarin Oriental about 3 years ago and this quickly replaced my previous favorite, the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku for a number of reasons. First of all, and this may be obvious is location – Nihonbashi is a 5 minute cab ride from Tokyo station or a 10 minute walk. Its location also offers something else. There are plenty of restaurants nearby that are open on a Sunday night – important if you show-up late, jetlagged, restless and itching to explore.A comfortable bed, complicated shower, multiple TVs and work facilities may have become standard fare for this class of hotel but the designers of these rooms seem to have hit the right balance between homely comfort and trendier-than-thou styling. The view from all the rooms is fantastic but avoid the lowest floor number (30 I think?) as the wrap-around balcony and machinery for cleaning windows somewhat obscures the edge-of-a-precipice view of the city (ignore this advise if you are scared of heights).Breakfast is something I usually skip but jetlag does strange things and I often wake up famished. Other five star hotels in town often fall short, with a lack-luster buffet or itemized pricing which will make that sushi dinner in Ginza you were wondering how to expense look cheap. The Mandarin Oriental nails breakfast completely, regardless of your preference for Western, Chinese (dim sum) or Japanese style. Make sure this is included in your room rate as you won’t want to miss it.The service in this Mandarin is nothing short of legendary. Nothing is too much trouble and many of the staff go to the extent of remembering names even if you are there for just a couple of nights. If you bring young children, expect the staff to engage with them too. Having spent months in another 5 star hotel across town where I was always anonymous this is a very pleasant contrast and never gets to the point of being overbearing or invasive. One other important point – if things do go wrong – like the wrong room type or room rate the management team are quick to resolve the issue quickly and amicably with follow-up. In my experience what often happens in other hotels in town is the staff will apologize profusely, but no actual progress is made in fixing the problem.Other worthy mentions worth a visit are the bar (although the New York Bar at the Park Hyatt does win out as a destination) and the usually deserted but well equipped gym.",,andy C,4,5.0

It is beautifully decorated and has incredible 360 degree bird's eye views of Tokyo. It's like a palace in the sky. The service was OUTSTANDING. From the moment you are greeted at the door on arrival, to the very unconventional check-in process - we were taken not to the front desk but directly to our suite where we settled in seamlessly and comfortably while completing check-in details. This was a first!We stayed in the Oriental suite, a corner unit that was just incredibly perfect. A bottle of Moet and a bowl of cherries awaited us on the coffee table, sweeping views of Tokyo were visible from every picture window, along with Mount Fuji peering from afar. Room service and in-room dining were impeccable, we looked forward to brunch in our suite every day. The beds were a bit firm...this is my only criticism. Since we prefer a pillow top mattress we would order an extra duvet to use as one, plus extra feather pillows. Turn down service provides a unique ""pillow menu"" so you can order something as specific as you like! Plus, pajamas and aromatherapy are provided which is a nice touch.This was our first visit to Tokyo and I am so glad we made the choice to stay at the Mandarin. Chuo is a great upscale area, right next door to the Ginza shopping district and very convenient to the Metro, you don't even technically have to leave the building to get to the trains. Just a short escalator ride down.

Everyone was congenial and nice. The doormen always had a smile on their faces and were very quick to greet you as you entered the facilities. Also, the concierge was great. He was able to secure us reservations at the two separate, hard to get, 3-michelin-star restaurants that we really wanted to try even before we arrived at the hotel. When we did arrive, he made sure to send us a map and directions on how to get to the two restaurants since Tokyo streets are very confusing. The room's view was incredible and during the night, my husband and I would just enjoy sake gazing out upon the twinkling lights of the city and the Tokyo sky tree. The toilet was really high tech and the bed very comfortable. The TV was huge and the room was impeccably clean. There was only one sink however and the lighting made it hard to apply make-up. The location was really good, very close to Tokyo's metro (infact, it was right in the bottom of the hotel). It was also in walking district from great shopping and the Ginza area. Also if you like quiet, it was definitely quiet at night. Negatives for us: 1. No free internet. I always find this insulting at this caliber and expense of a hotel.2. Quiet area, while i realize this might be a positive for some, it was a negative for my husband and I as we enjoy going out on the town at night. When we went out at night we had to travel quite far away from our hotel and since the Tokyo subway stops running at around midnight, we had to always take an expensive cab ride home. It was usually ~$65 USD every single one way trip on the cab ride home at night from the popular ""going out"" areas in Tokyo.

The standard room was more than adequate, and had amazing views of Tokyo Sky Tree. The suite was massive, and also had good views, although it faced away from the Sky Tree. Excellent city views seemed to be provided from most of the common areas of the hotel as well (lobby bar, lobby bathrooms, spa, breakfast, etc).On the negative side, we went for breakfast at 6am, which is the stated opening time, as we had to get an early flight. They were not ready for us at 6am, and we had to wait about 15 minutes before being able to access the buffet, and even then it was only partially ready. This was disappointing for a hotel of this calibre. Breakfast itself was nothing special as well.It is also a very expensive hotel, in terms of room rates, as well as meals, spa, etc, so be prepared to spend a lot.

You can order from all different types of pillows and room service will deliver it to you at any time of the day or night. I felt so pampered in this hotel. The only bad thing that I would say about this hotel is that it's located in the business center, so there is no action after 8pm. You can however, find some restaurants if you walk around but good luck finding one with an English menu. But you can take the Ginza line (right under the hotel) two stops away and end-up in Ginza. That's where all the action happens. There is also lots of action happening in the lounge area, tea room, and restaurants, but i refuse to be confined to my hotel. I want to explore a little bit.

Your bags are taken from you and whisked to your room, and the person who takes you up in the beautifully appointed elevator to the lobby on the 38th floor with its eye-popping views over the city of Tokyo treats you with suitable deference but also with enough friendliness to make you feel welcome.At the check-in desk this friendliness and feeling of welcome continue as the checking in process is completed quickly and efficiently, yet with that same feeling of welcome. Soon you're on your way to your room. And what a room it is! For the last several times I've stayed here I've super-splurged and stayed in their ""Oriental Suite,"" which is more like a very elegant apartment! It's on the corner of the building, and you have fantastic views of the Tokyo skyline on two sides, from the railroad station on one end to the new Tokyo Sky Tree on the other. You have what amounts to five rooms, including the immense living room, the spacious bedroom, a bathroom that is easily the size of most hotel rooms in Japan with its separate bath and shower, a dressing room, an entryway, and even a second bathroom for use if you have guests coming to visit. And why would you not want to have guests come to visit and marvel at the luxury?There are TWO 50-inch flat screen TVs, a DVD player including several DVDs for you to watch, enough couches and lounging chairs to fill a small hotel lobby, a desk for working on your computer (the only negative thing I have to say about this room is that after paying a huge amount to stay here you still have to pay for internet use) and a mini-bar. I can't think of much else you could want to make your stay a wonderful one!The curtains on the windows are electrically operated, as indeed most everything in the room is, and you could theoretically just lie in bed and operate everything in either of the rooms! The bed, needless to say, is pure heaven, soft, wide, large and with enough pillows to make you comfortable no matter what.When I arrived at my room, behold, I found a nice bottle of expensive champagne and some fresh fruit with which to enjoy my stay. I'd have to say that just about EVERYTHING you could possibly want has been included in this suite.Now this does not come cheap, but if you can, you really need to experience the total luxury of this place.As far as the rest of the hotel, their fitness center and spa are state of the art. The o-furo (Japanese style bath) is a marvel. There are two big baths and a sauna that overlook the entire city of Tokyo, and the fitness center has every exercise possibility known to man. If you stay in a suite, these are all included in the room rate. I splurged a little and had an in-room massage which was truly a wonderful experience.If it sounds as if I'm totally in love with this hotel, you're right. If I'm ever in Japan and can possibly fit it into my budget, I'm staying here! Highest recommendation.","Kaneohe, Hawaii","Whitsiepoo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kaneohe, Hawaii</strong>",164,5.0

Basically compared to hotels anywhere else in the world they are in a different league wether staying in a good one or a bad one. As such it makes almost no sense to do so. However as I have stayed in the mandarin a lot I thought I might as well review it. Went again last week. As usual everything is perfect when you get to the room. I dont particularly like the fact that the hotel lobby is on the 38th floor but then again the views are sepctacular. You can literally look into the emperors back yard.  Food is great, service is excellent. There is pretty much nothing bad I can say about it the only one little thing is that the concierge are if anything too helpful - I dont mind getting my own taxi just outside particularly when I am in a hurry. But then again that is Japan for you. MO have combined Japanese exceptional service with a hotel with brilliant rooms (very spacious with a couch in each and a separate super sized tub as well as a gigantic japanese and western combi style shower.

The best part is the location: built over the Mitsukoshimae metro stop (Ginza line) and one block from Mitsukoshi and its basement food court. My suggestion would be to book direct;y with the property on their website to give maximum flexibility if you are not happy with assigned room at check in; then you can better negotiate a change or upgrade, at of course, a higher price.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Pancho_cisco</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",62,5.0

I am impressed by the Japanese hospitality and their respect for their own culture. LOCATION :The Hotel ...... it seems to sit right on top of the Mitsukoshimae Subway station , on the GINZA line. From Haneda airport we took the train to Nihonbashi station and then changed to the Ginza line, Mitsukoshimae was just one stop away. As you walk out of exit no 8 at the Mitsukoshimae , the first thing you see is the Mandarin Oriental Hotel .The Subway station has a family mart ( a convenience store chain in Tokyo ). Right next door to the Hotel is the Mistukoshi dept store Tokyo Station is very close by SERVICE :The top class service culture of the Mandarin Oriental was catapulted to new heights by the support of traditional Japanese hospitality In the ratings section at tripadvisor i have an option to rate the Service on a scale of 1 to 5 ...... i would like to give the service at Mandarin a 7 or an 8 out of 5.Every staff member in the Hotel made a genuine effort to make you more than comfortable and deliver their best . I noticed that the staff seemed to be trained to say only YES , to every thing we requested. If at any point they had to say a no , the staff member seemed uncomfortable .DINING :One afternoon , we came in late from a morning tour and were looking for lunch at the Sushi restaurant in the Hotel. We are vegetarian and we had not made any special booking . But the chef was happy to whip up some vegetarian sushis, served with fresh wasabi and a Vegetarian soup. It was a unique experience for us since they prepared everything from fresh ingredients right in front of you. The Sushi bar has a very cosy atmosphere and a friendly staff who engage you in conversation. All in all ,,good food and a pleasant experienceAlso their In-room dining service was good CONCIERGE SERVICE - THE HIGHLIGHT I cannot say enough about the concierge service. They were very knowledgeable and had all the information you may need , on their finger tips . They seem to be prepared for nearly all questions that you may have. Before i came to Tokyo i was not sure if i could make my way around on my own considering that many in Japan did not speak English . But whenever i asked for directions , the concierge would be ready for a few sheets in print , some giving a description how to take the trains , and what exits to take , and always with a map with locations marked both in English and in Japanese .This made things so easy that travelling from one place to another was a breezeWhat was amusing but very pleasing also was that one day the concierge had to research some information and give to us later . In the night when we returned , there was an envelope lying in the room with the information . But the interesting part was that the top of the envelope and the important points in the text of the note... was decorated with stickers of Cherry blossom flowers. It was very nice . It just showed how much pleasure and interest the concierge took in their job . I would like to name Ms Sumida from the concierge as someone who provided us with extraordinary service and helped us with a smile everytime we went upto the desk ...... and believe me that we visited the concierge desk rather regularly.......... The porters / bellboys were very very efficient . Always available and ready to help you. When we checked into the Hotel , while we were going through the formalities of check in ..... our luggage was alredy in our room GUEST ROOMS :Very large and spacious by any standards .... and as i understand the room is HUGE by Tokyo standards. Very modern rooms All amenities that you may need Very clean Good Soft beds ........ they also have a Pillow Menu if you like to make a choice of any specific type of pillow Huge Flat screen TV , Video player , Room Safe , Fantastic toilet , with a large Bath Tub ( nearly circular ) , separate shower area , heated toilet seat , Electronic controlled toilet and Bidet ....I can say this in conclusion ...... its not the cheapest of establishments .... BUT .... every small detail to design and every employee in the establishment makes an effort to provide good value for every dollar you pay . If the Hotel fits your budget .... this should be your choice in Tokyo","Singapore, Singapore","SingaporeNRI</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",52,5.0

The lobby for the hotel is on the 38th floor of the building, and the rooms are on floors 30-36. This setup is a little inconvenient because to get to your room you have to first take an elevator from the ground floor to the lobby, and then walk to the other side of the lobby to take a separate elevator down to your room. However, that inconvenience is immediately forgotten after seeing the incredible views of Tokyo from the 2-story tall picture windows on both the east and west sides of the lobby. It is simply amazing.The lobby is perched above a couple of restaurants and a bar on the floor below which all share the same windows. Unfortunately, this means that the cigarette and cigar smoke from the bar below is readily noticeable in the lobby.The rooms are very nicely appointed, and are large by Asian standards. The furnishings, like the rest of the hotel, are very contemporary. We were on the 32nd floor and had amazing views towards Shinjuku, and when the clouds and haze finally lifted, Mt. Fuji was also visible. With all the rooms being so high, I'm not sure if there is such thing as a ""bad view"" in this hotel.Every night a tray was placed on the bed that had a portfolio that the TV remote was stored in, as well as a little bottle of aroma therapy scent and a small dish to pour the contents in. It was a great touch to make the experience in the room that much more special.The bathroom was nice, but has the weird glass wall in to the bedroom that can be made private by closing blinds. You can close the blinds completely for privacy, but it's just a strange concept. The water closet was behind a frosted glass door, and had the high tech toilet you frequently hear about. The shower was open to the tub area (i.e., no door) but amazingly there was no issue with water splashing everywhere. The bath products are some of the nicest I've encountered in a hotel.We dined each morning in the restaurant for breakfast which was included in our room rate - it's very expensive otherwise. It consisted of a nice breakfast buffet which included pastries, breads, jams, fruits, salad, soups, dim sum, potatoes, bacon, sausage, waffles, etc. It was a nice spread, and a nice mix of Asian and Western foods. Our breakfast also included a choice of egg, which is where things get strange. The eggs, though they taste relatively normal, are red. Apparently it is due to the diet of rosehip and chile fead to the chickens (a factoid on the menu we completely missed until the last morning). We also had dinner one night in this restaurant and the food was very good, with a view to match. The building the hotel is in is connected underground to the Mitsukoshimae station, though it is a bit of a hike (albeit out of the weather) to the Hanzomon Line. The Mitsukoshi main store is located one block over, and is definitely worth exploring. The store itself is beautiful, and the basement food floor is usually jammed full of people.I had a couple of small issues with the hotel, but were not enough to keep me from staying there again. First the aforementioned smokey smell in the lobby coming from the bar below. Secondly, the coffee in the room was instant coffee as no coffee maker was provided. Thirdly, and most disappointingly, internet access is not included in the room rate. For the amount of money I'm paying for this hotel, I do not expect to pay for internet access.The absolute best part about this hotel was the service. Every single employee was 'on the ball' all the time. They were always ready and going the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable and appreciated. The attention to detail was impeccable. For example, one day we left some of our travel books out on the desk. When we returned, housekeeping had placed a nice bookmark on top of the books for us. But I saved the best for last. Due to an unforeseen travel situation, our luggage was delayed from arriving for 24 hours. After checkin as they were preparing to show us to our room, we were asked if we had any luggage, and we explained the situation. About 15 minutes after we got settled in to our room, the doorbell rang and housekeeping presented us with an 'emergency kit.' The large box contained new t-shirts, boxers, and socks as well as hair care products and pajamas. The enclosed note even offered to overnight launder the clothing we were wearing. This type of service was completely unexpected, and was above and beyond the call of duty in my opinion. This moment - just 15 minutes after arriving in the room - was the defining moment that set the tone for a thoroughly enjoyable stay. I would never think twice about staying here again.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","HauntedMansion</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Worth, Texas, USA</strong>",15,5.0

I am probably the least fussy luxury hotel lover around but there are things that I seriously would expect from the so-called one of the finest hotels in Tokyo. Mind you, the price ain't cheap either. Don't get me wrong, MOTYO is amazing on it's own right, beautiful building, interior design, nice rooms, huge bathroom etc etc.. same old stuff.I was well taken care of although i arrived very early and our room was ready as we reached and we were escorted to our room, with our luggages arrived in first. Good one. However there's something missing here.. after a long midnight flight, i thought the hotel attendant would offer us tea, or something else.. But no, not a word on tea. Mind you, I was at Mandarin Oriental Landmark last month, and i check-in early as well and they served me tea right away since i looked groggy and tired. Not that its a must, but really its those small little things that put a smile on ur face. Welcome room amenities? 3 mandarin oranges, which comes in standard i think, and 6 strawberries placed in a plain bowl. Not sure whats so welcoming about that, but i've seen better welcome amenities, of hotels of the same range and calibre. Oh yes, welcome note came along too, but it was computer generated. Thank you :)On concierge, I asked 2 things. First, is there a place in the city itself that i can pre-purchase tickets to Disneyland Tokyo. She said, NO. I need to go line up in the morning at Disneyland itself early in the morning to get them. To cut things short, i bumped into a Disney store which she didn't mention, at Shibuya, and tada.. we got out tickets for our trip for the day after tomorrow. The queue at the entrance of disneyland on the said date was unbearable if we didn't prepurchase those tickets. How could the concierge did not know this? Secondly, I requested the concierge to guide me on how to get to Kawaguchiko and then from there to Gotemba. The Concierge said she will look it up and send it to my room, for the directions and all. Guess what? for the entire stay, it didn't arrive to our room. Thank God i got friends in Tokyo to help me. I did not expect upgrades or super duper luxury services. But seriously i was expecting too much or i just came on the wrong time on the wrong date with different staff. MOTYO is still worth staying, location is amazing, views are amazing, and most staff are very gracious and smiley. Just to share, Landmark MO HK sent me letter, emails, surveys after my stay. Just to see how was my stay and rectifying issues that arose during my stay there. Now that's a service you don't see everyday. I was hipefully to receive and email or two from MOTYo honestly, but its been almost a week, none came in. For the price, its really comparable to Peninsula and Park Hyatt which both also are my favorite brands. MOTYo could easily been these two, if they truly brush up their services a little bit more. and obviously, i expected too much :)",Kuala Lumpur,"Qim84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>",21,3.0

I just wanted to add my review to the mix. The amazing views won me over. I have a great view where I live in Kobe so I am used to having something to look at every day and the views from all around the Mandarin did not disappoint. From the tea room, you could see the new ""Tokyo Sky Tree"" tower dwarfing all of the other buildings in the city. On the other side of the building, we could see Mt. Fuji and the sunsets were beautiful from there. The room was great like everyone else has said on here and the people working there were always kind and helpful.The desserts in the tea room were gross though. I eat desserts every day and usually love them in 5-star hotels but the ones that they served almost made me gag. I even love to eat Japanese sweets called ""wagashi"" but the stuff they served tasted like medicine that was meant to be swallowed and not chewed. As a sugar addict, these could not even be eaten. My friend would not eat his dessert either. But the views and the service far outweighed their lousy desserts so I did not take off any points. I would not hesitate to stay there again even though they could use a quality selection of sweets.","Kyoto, Japan","kobekeith</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kyoto, Japan</strong>",321,5.0

Only minor glitch was the discrepancy between what was advertised through American Express Platinum travel package what the hotel provided. When asked about this discrepancy, the hotel did not make it right by me but just asked that I accepted the discrepancy. This is not what I would have expected from the Mandarin Hotel group. Also, the internet was not provided as part of the room price. At the price of these rooms, it's a bit annoying to have to pay for wi-fi service.

My husband and I stayed for two nights, and from the moment we stepped through the door, the staff made us feel as though we were the only guests. The room was fantastic, with every thought put into the layout and amenities. We tried some restaurants: the casual Italian restaurant on the 2nd floor where you can try a bit of anything and everything. A good mix of cuisines - Italian to Asian- something to suit everyone. Nicola, our host, was top notch and offered the kind of service I find on cruise ships - he couldn't do enough for us. I'm not the demanding type at all, but he took clues from my comments and offered suggestions. For example, I wasn't sure which red wine I wanted so I told him what I like and he brought me two to try, one which I much preferred over the other, so I really appreciated the gesture. The Sushi bar is truly unforgettable, too. The simplicity of the interior is calming and soothing, so exquisite and stylish, just as it should be when you choose to experience up-close, the ancient Japanese art of creating sushi. How the chef shapes the rice, slices the fish and garnishes like they were creating a piece of artwork. During my stay I found the staff to be very helpful: if you have unusual but reasonable requests, you can be sure the staff will go the extra mile. If I ever stay in Tokyo again, then this is where we will definitely return to.

For example, I'm always impressed that when I walk up to the front desk to check in, they already know who I am, and have all the paperwork prepared (I think the staff on the ground floor must sneak a peak at my luggage tag and radio up to the check-in staff. My first time there, after having checked out, the woman accompanying me downstairs in the lift noticed my Cathay Pacific luggage tag, and asked me if I had registered for miles for my stay. I hadn't known I could, and as soon as I said no, she pulled out a pen and a pad of paper, took down my mileage number, and said ""I will take care of it for you"".

The welcome fruit is always delicious, especially my first stay there, where the large sweet strawberries dusted with caster sugar was out of this world.Location is perfect for my work.

From the moment you enter the impressive lobby you feel in a complete different world. Attention to your needs is always there, spacious and luxury rooms with breathtaking views and yes, you will have to pay for Wi-Fi, but the signal is strong and covers the entire hotel, whether in the rooms, at the bar or in the restaurants. Staff is very courteous, extreemly friendly and will do all to make you feel at ease. Mind you that Tokyo is a very big city, an easy access to the Tokyo subway network downstairs in the basement is an added convenience. This is a hotel which won't disappoint.

Check all the high end / luxury hotel boxes scorecard. There were beautiful views of Shinjuku from our room. The gym is also good as others have pointed out and much better than the typical 5 star hotel gym. I did notice that some of the carpets are in bad need of cleaning (especially downstairs) which most people would probably overlook (I focus that generally).

Because I always feel at home. From my good friend Ishii san (a true treasure to the hotel) at the front desk, to the refreshing sound of the blinds rising automatically raising themselves when you first enter the room, all is good and right. Rooms are fantastic, service impeccable, and on those magic days when the weather is right, you can cast an eye out towards Fuji as you enjoy your breakfast.I have stayed here both as a business traveller (mostly) and as a tourist (sadly, only occasionally). The hotel caters surprisingly well to both traveling castes. Not to mention the enigmatic Johnny Walker, the de facto head of Tokyo's contemporary arts scene, enjoys his morning coffee there most days. For an entrance into aesthetic Tokyo, no greater Virgil can be found.So how does it compare to its peers in the city? Clearly, all excel in service with location an added feature for others (with the Ritz-Carlton and the Grand Hyatt nearly equidistant from the Almond at Roppongi Crossing). None are bad; in fact all are excellent. Each hotel, however, has its personality.

The health club was well appointed and spotless.

We'd just come off the overnight flight from Sydney and were swept away by the attentive service and the amazing views. We were expecting to just leave our bags and wait for check in time to come around, but MO already had a room waiting for us. They happily accomodated our request for a booking that night at the Molecular Tapas restuarant and provided us with a map and some ideas for an afternoons sightseeing. Unfortunately the day we arrived was Friday 11 March, the same day as the earthquake. We were very fortunate in that we had arrived back in the lobby of the office building that houses MO just as the earthquake struck. Afterwards we headed into the ground floor lobby of the MO to try and find out more (at this point we had no idea that it was so bad), the very sweet young female staff member in the lobby told us that the earthquake was very big and would we please wait in the lobby as it was the safest place to be. She patiently answered our questions and calmed us, even though she must have been scared as well. The elevators in the building had stopped working and so we were waiting for them to be fixed. As we waited there were numerous aftershocks and at each time the staff would hold down any items that could fall and calmed those more nervous customers. The staff were incredibly calm and efficient. After about 1.5 hours, I started to get quite cold as it was winter, and at that point the very sweet staff member who initially answered our questions took us up one flight of stairs to the MO's cafe in the mezzanine area of the lobby, which they had managed to get power to and open up. As soon as we sat down they brought us warm cups of hot green tea, newspapers and took our coffee order. For which I was ever so grateful! When we were able to return to our hotel room, we were personally escorted back to the hotel lobby. The staff were so attentive and seemed geniunely concerned about us, we on the other hand were very worried for them and their families. Upon returning to our room we were told that the Molecular Tapas restaurant would not be opening due to the damage suffered in the earthquake, but we could go to the french restaurant. So we did. The food was superb - most amazing abalone dish I have ever eaten. Again the professionalism shown was outstanding, even whilst the building swayed constantly from aftershocks. I can't speak highly enough about the Chef, his team and the waitstaff. We ended up leaving the MO a day earlier than planned, and again service was impeccable, this time the concierge was so understanding and patient. He arranged accomodation for us in Kyoto, and whilst we went downstairs to pack, prepared for us a map of Tokyo Station so we could redeem our rail passes and get to the platform, and gave us a map of Kyoto marking where we were staying and what sights we should see there. In addition, he even told us which seats were the best on the train to get. The concierge then out of his own initiative very kindly cancelled our other Tokyo restaurant reservations that he had made on our behalf when it become clear that we were not returning to Tokyo. I couldn't recommend the MO highly enough. They made us feel safe and calm at a time when I'm sure they were feeling anything but.

I've stayed here three times and each time it just gets better. From the moment you arrive until the moment you leave you are pampered and treated like royalty. Although I have to admit this hotel is the priciest at which I've ever stayed, I can only say that it's totally worth every penny (well...yen). My room was beautifully appointed, spotlessly clean and had a just fantastic view, including Mount Fuji when the haze cleared away. I've read some other reviews and don't understand how anyone could find anything negative to say about this place. The person who said there was nothing going on in the neighborhood didn't find some of the great restaurants and bars located just across the street, along with some mind blowing shopping. The folks who thought the spa was too expensive didn't take advantage of the fact that it's free from 6 to 9 in the morning and that if you use the fitness centre for even a couple of minutes you are allowed to use the spa free of charge. They even provide you with fitness centre clothes to use while you're taking advantage of this free service. Add to this the feeling that you are an honored friend the second you step off the elevator into the lobby, the total elegance of the setting, the tremendous views from almost anyplace in the building, and I would have to say this is as close to perfection you can find.I also would like to add my recommendation to any gentleman who wants a good laugh to visit the men's room in the 38th floor lobby. It's certainly the most spectacular place I have ever found to do one's ... ahem ... business.I also would like to recommend the Oriental Lounge off the lobby. It's a great place to have a nice drink while overlooking Tokyo, all the great train action (I'm a big fan of Japanese trains) and the Imperial Palace as well as, if the weather's right, Mount Fuji. So save up, skimp on other locations but definitely make it a point to visit this one-of-a-kind hotel experiences.

We arrived fatigued and slightly under the weather. Thankfully, the staff were both omnipresent and unobtrusive. The building afforded the crucial needs that weary travels seek out with a pharmacy in the basement lobby, as well as a host of other shops (convenience store and a spate of small bars and light bites). That evening found us taking a brief cab trip from the hotel. Even though the area is primarily a business district, providence brought us to a brilliant small sushi restaurant operated by Shigemasa Kurosawa. The delectible sushi omakase was simply beyond words and even the late hour of our meal's conclusion would not be deterred by struggling to catch a cab back to the hotel. That night, we enjoyed spectacular views of the city and the serene opulence of the room. The next day found us reeling from the prior two weeks - and the room made for an exemplary refuge from the tumult of the city below. The extraordinary breakfast that was complimentary due to our booking the reservation through the American Express Platinum Travel Service proved to be sufficient to last the next day for our Shinkansen trip to Nagano to hike up to the Jikudan Monkey Park. That night, having returned exhilarated and weary from a day observing the famed Macaque snow monkeys, a Michelin star meal at the restaurant was appealing but not very practicable given our appearance (hiking boots and GoreTex). Again, the Mandarin came through with flying colors - room service with a selection from the famed pastry chef in residence (and a champion of the International Pastry Chef Competition). Our day of departure was again made equally pleasant and smooth; we planned to take a cab to Tokyo Station in order to catch the Airpirt Limousine bus to Narita. As luck would have it, the bus arrived as we loaded the cab. Without missing a note, the bell captain literally sprinted over, negotiated inclusion of our passage (normally requiring a prior reservation) and expressed all our heavy bags into the hands of the bus porters.

If I had to choose I'd probably pick the MO if they were the same price. Here is how the different attributes stack up, in my opinion:Location - P wins big, on the edge of the Imperial Gardens and Ginza. MO is a 20 min walk north from P.Rooms - P. P had much beds, bathtub and toilets (an artform in Japan). MO had much better shower and toiletries (incredible products, esp the bathsalts). The decor and layout were equally wonderful at both hotels, as were the views.Common Spaces - MO wins big. Though I am not a fan of the common MO setup of having the lobby on the top floor (requiring you to take two elevators from your room to the exit, one up to the lobby, another one down to the street), I loved the look and feel of this hotel - serene, lovely and efficient. Gorgeous views and architecture. P's setup is much more convenient, but the lobby feels small and chaotic with the restaurant planted right in the middle. Not a space where we wanted to linger in the least.  Service - MO wins big. P is fine, but MO goes above and beyond. The concierge staff at P was harried.Food - MO wins. The food at the restaurant in P's lobby was mediocre. The food in the casual cafe in the P basement is tasty but the location in the basement in not ideal. We didn't try ""Peter"", on the top floor of P, because the cigarette smoke was so strong.MO has five restaurants - four with incredible views, (including the all-day dining, more casual place which had a wonderful breakfast buffet) , three with Michelin stars. Gym - tie. P has a lovely pool, but the gym is small with no windows. MO's gym is bigger with great views, but no pool. Both had nice, new machines. Spa - P because of pricing.

The gym is very good, with the best views I have ever seen (from a gym) and the juice drinks they have are one of a kind. Spa is very peaceful also with great views, but I find the services to extremely overpriced. The design of the hotel is what really sets it apart.

It was an excellent choice, everything was perfect. On the first morning, we nearly missed b/f because of the jetlag -- when we got there, it was literally 5 mins before their closing time. What did they do? With the most friendly, elegant and honest smile and a little bow, they apologized that b/f ""would only be open for another 30 mins today"" and what could they get us to make us feel better with all the jetlag. One word that it was actually our mistake? None. One expression that made us feel uncomfortable? Nothing like that, just perfect service and honest friendliness (that made it embarrasing enough for us). The rest of our stay was equally immaculate, they were very helpful in assisting us to find our ways and to make restaurant reservations. When we got caught out by pouring rain and returned dripping wet, the bell captain on the ground floor called reception while we were in the elevator up to the 38th floor and when the doors opened, two lovely members of the staff were waiting for us with towels. Need I say more? To top it off, the rooms are very spacious and the restaurants in the hotel are trendy and serve excellent food. A no-brainer from my perspective. Only downside I can think of: no swimming pool.","Vienna, Austria","csaa1480</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vienna, Austria</strong>",105,5.0

One of the priciest hotels in Tokyo and service levels at the high level you would expect but the location is not great for exploring the city requiring an almost immediate change on the underground system. The line the hotel is on doesn't really head anywhere of interest in the city. In addition given the price paid, I find it very annoying that the hotel chooses to charge for wi-fi access!! Isn't this standard now especially at that level of hotel. Also there is no pool.The views are great from the rooms and whilst everyone talks about the spa, the facilities are only OK and the treatment standard but expensive (we had someone who appeared to be in training! which you wouldn't expect for a £400 massage..).I would recommend the Penninsula over this hotel.

The service at the Mandarin was great. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. After I had checked in, many staff members remembered my name and they would say hello to me whenever I went through the lobby to return to my hotel room. Also, I had left my Blackberry charger at home and they immediately found me a charger that I can use in my room. We also got a lot of help from the concierge who helped us find sushi restaurants, hard-to-find shops. We even called the concierge on our mobile phone to help us find a good sushi restaurant in Ginza and they did not disappoint.The rooms were very large for Japanese hotel room standards and the toilet was especially large with a bench to sit on in the shower and a big bathtub as well. We got a corner room so we had a nice city view from our room. The TV was huge and the bed and pillows was very comfortable. The slippers were so comfortable I ended up buying another pair to bring home. We had room service breakfast and the quality of food was impeccable. Green tea pancakes were very tasty. One evening, we had drinks at the bar, which had a really cool atmosphere, a mini indoor waterfall and a live band to keep us entertained. Overall, the service of the Mandarin Oriental is always outstanding and that is why it is my 5 star hotel of choice. If you stay in Tokyo and don't mind staying near Mitsukoshi Mae metro station.

Let me start with the service. It cannot get any better. It was absolutely perfect. I have two examples (of many). First, my wife and I walked to the hotel from Tokyo Station to get some fresh air after a 15 hour flight. When we turned the corner into the driveway area, the instant the bellhop saw us, he literally sprinted about 100 feet to get to us to take our bags. We were then walked to the reception desk where the front desk was waiting for us and greeted us by name. Second, we called for extra towels, and unlike most other hotels that take at least 20 minutes to bring the towels (even at other high end hotels), the towels arrived at our door in 2 minutes on a silver platter. As for the rooms they are great. Once you get to a certain level of hotel, it really becomes a matter of personal taste, but we thought the room was great. Though, I wish the shower had a door. It's not a big deal, but the shower feels a bit cold since its open to the rest of the bathroom. We really liked the ""service closet"" where the hotel staff can leave stuff for you, rather than having to open the door (e.g., mail deliveries, laundry, morning newspaper). The fitness center was great as well (with a good view!). The only real complaint are the restaurants. We had breakfast and dinner at the hotel, and the food was ok, but it was incredibly overpriced. Skip the hotel restaurants and go elsewhere.

I have just finished packing for this trip, it is 4:30 in the morning, and I have a flight to catch in a couple of hours. The packing process brought back a lot of fond memories I had during my previous stay in February 2010, and I just couldn't help but sit in front of my computer and finish writing this review that was meant to be posted a few months ago.........RESERVATIONS and PRE-ARRIVALI have previously written a review based on this aspect of my Tokyo experience, but there was more to it, while exchanging emails with the Concierge Team, I casually mentioned that I was going to rent a MPV for the trip but wasn't sure which one to choose from due to the size of the vehicles and the height limitation of various Car Parks in the Ginza area. Next thing I received in my email box was a map of the Ginza area, with all Car Park locations, vehicle height limits and operating hours clearly stated.ARRIVALWe arrived at the hotel late in the afternoon, after a 4 hour car ride from the ski resort, we were very tired, looking forward to checking in and have a rest, there were 7 of us, 16 pieces of luggage and 10 of them. No it was not a typo, there were 10 of them, we were in the room faster than anything I have ever experienced. (and yes, they checked us in in the room)That is NOT just it, a day prior to our arrival, my older son had a minor accident on the ski slope and scratched his face, there was this horrific patch on his face, one of the Guest Relations team member has suggested that we should get some cream for the wound. Well, guess what, the cream arrived before our luggage did.......TRAVELLING WITH CHILDRENIf you are travelling with children, make sure you tell them, you will be amazed at the range of child amenities they can provide, and did I mention the mouth watering sweets and snacks and popcorn at turn down? If you are travelling without kids, you might want to consider lying about it, it is worth it!!!!DINNER RESERVATIONS and MOREOne of the nights, the Concierge has recommended us to a Japanese restaurants in another hotel in the Ginza area, the moment I stopped the car in front of the hotel, I was greeted by my Surname, from the valet staff, door man, reception lady to all restaurant staff..... that was a very good dinner by the way.... but not as good as the surprises and the attention that we were given, for being a Mandarin Oriental guestAFTERNOON BUFFETWe went shopping on one of the afternoons, and for obvious reasons we have lost track of time and was late for a reserved seating for the afternoon buffet at Ventaglio in the hotel. By the time we got there, we were an hour late and was 25 minutes from the closing time of the buffet. When we were just about to rush out to the food table to savage whatever is left, the manager and his team started to assemble a mini buffet setup at our own table........ well, it actually wasn't mini at allIf I was to sit here and continue writing about all the great things that I have experienced at MOTYO, I will miss my flight in the morning..........

The service we received was unparalleled. Given that we travelled during Christmas and the New Year period and it was our first time in Japan, we asked the concierge to help us with booking the train tickets from Tokyo to Kyoto. In the end they booked us the tickets for our whole 10 days stay in Japan and in different cities, despite all the difficulties caused by the fact that we travelled during the holiday period when the trains we full and apparently booked by the locals well in advance. The attention to detail from the personnel was exceptional. On our anniversary we ate at the Sense restaurant - food was delicious and they brought us a cake as a (free) surprise (we were happy that they did not sing some Happy anniversary song though...). The views from the room and from the restaurant were breathtaking, during breakfast we could see how the Sun raises over Tokyo... Well, in the beginning the hotel seemed so chick that it was a bit intimidating, but the personnel always made us feel welcome. In the end of our stay in Japan we came back to Tokyo and had a reservation at Four Seasons, since they had a promotional rate, which was slightly cheaper that MO. However, after MO the Four Seasons felt just ok (though we once stayed in 4S Las Vegas and it was superb), nothing exquisite and charging for each little thing/step extra, which was not the case of MO.

My family and I went away for my father's birthday and decided to stay at the Mandarin Oriental. Before I even left for the hotel I was emailing the concierge and the restaurant managers. I organised my father's birthday dinner at the Tapas bar, and spoke with the concierge about other restaurants (booked Robataya and also Ukai-Tei) and also a day trip to Kyoto. Their prearrival service was fantastic, and it was nice to know a lot of the trip was taken care of before we left.We arrived at the hotel by hotel organised van at around 8pm after a long flight and the first thing that hits you is (1) you are on the 42nd floor, and (2) are the huge 2 storey windows that look over Tokyo! Kumiko (the concierge) was there to greet my entire family and provided the train tickets to Kyoto, and all the information on the private tour we booked as well as the restaurants in a plastic folder. She included maps to the restaurants as well as confirmations. We were then escorted to our rooms which were three all in a row (which is very unusual). The rooms were amazing with great views over the whole of Tokyo. The beds were very comfortable and they had slippers and gowns. They also gave us little food items every day (we had strawberries, sashimi, cakes, chocolates etc). The hotel is very clean and the staff are all very firendly. The bar is amazing as it is two stories and has a waterfall and seats floating over a pond. Everyone is so helpful and always knew our names. They did such thoughtful little things.. such as we had left a book on the bed open to the page we were reading and when we got back it was on the bedside table with a book mark in it. They let us have our rooms until 4pm on our last day even though the hotel was fully booked. We requested some information on Disneyland and 3 mins later they had slipped all the information we needed under our door!!!We went to three restaurants at the hotel (the breakfast one, Sense (the cantonese) and also Tapas. They all had amazing decor and the breakfast was amazing. They had so many different options, and lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. Sense was so tasty! They cut up peking duck in front you of and the prawns were very good. They had a good selection of wine too. The best was the Tapas for my father's birthday. It was over 20 courses and each was better than the last. They did amazing things with food. Kumiko also organised a surprise for my dad which was very special. The location is pretty good - only about a 10min walk to Tokyo station, or a 5-10 min ride to Ginza. The staff outside always help you get a taxi and provide you with cards to show the driver so they know where to take you. They also make sure the driver's know where you are going before they leave. When we were leaving to the airport the van the hotel had organised us was already waiting out the front with our luggage already in it.The restaurants the hotel booked provided us also with amazing service. We always had private rooms/good table and they all knew it was my father's birthday so they all went above and beyond and gave him presents (flowers, the took photos of us and made it into a booklet for my father etc). The tour in Kyoto that the hotel booked was also the best I had been on!The hotel went above and beyond what was expected. They completely blew away our expectations (and we are picky :) ).

The views are spectacular. The decor is clean and contemporary. The rooms are spacious. The dining options are nicely varied and never fail to impress. But what sets this hotel apart from all the others I have stayed at is the level of service we received. Simply put, I have never experienced better service than I received during my week-long stay at the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo. Some of it is admittedly cultural. The staff bowing to you as the elevator doors close is one example. Yet the service here is more than simply tradition at play. Rather than try to describe the experience, which would surely be inadequate, here are some examples:1) We traveled to Kyoto via the Shinkansen bullet train for an overnight stay. When we asked the front desk how to purchase tickets for our trip, they offered to send a member of the concierge staff with us to the train station. Sure enough, she joined us on our taxi ride to the station and helped us purchase our tickets to Kyoto. 2) We checked out of the hotel for the one night stay in Kyoto, leaving our large bags behind at the Mandarin Oriental. When we arrived back at the hotel, the staff instantly recognized us, even though we had not provided our return information. They escorted us to our new room, which already had our luggage. We never had to ""check back in"" to the hotel. It was as if we had never left.3) Every time we ate dinner at the hotel, they would take our room number. Upon returning to the room, no matter how little or long we took to eat, the housekeeping staff had completed the evening turn down service. Those are just a few of the examples of the extraordinary service you will receive should you stay at the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo. Other little examples abound that you will surely experience on a daily basis.We stayed in a Premier Grand King Room, numbers 3204 and 3208. A few nice features about the room worth mentioning: 1) The floor-to-ceiling windows offer spectacular views of Tokyo. It's especially riveting at night when the city lights up. On clear days, you can see Mt. Fuji in the distance. 2) A control panel next to the bed allows you to open and close the blinds and adjust the lighting throughout the room. 3) A small closet next to the door is used to discretely deliver laundry and the morning's newspaper. No need to answer the door to accept any of these items from staff. You know they've arrived when the ""valet delivery"" sign is illuminated. 4) The shower comes equipped with three heads, any of which you may use depending on your shower preference: a movable shower head; a fixed, massaging shower head; and a rain shower head. 5) No need to bring a converter for the American three-prong electric plug. The desk has an outlet with a plug that is compatible for laptop cords.A few final notes about the hotel generally: 1) Please eat at either the 6:00pm or 8:30pm seating at Tapas. Maximum seating is only eight people. You sit side by side along a counter facing Chef Ramsey. He guides you through about 15-20 small dishes created through the process known as molecular gastronomy. It is an intimate and amazing culinary experience you will never forget. 2) Please get a swedish massage from Yumi. The spa itself is incredible and the massage was probably the best I've ever had. 3) The hotel is located right on top of the Mitsukosimae subway line. While the location of the hotel itself is not ideal for tourism, the subway is easy to get to and manage to travel on.The only negative comments I have about the hotel are that the bed is not soft enough for my taste (personal preference) and the steps required to get out of the hotel can be irritating. The reception area is located on the 38th floor, while our room was on the 32nd floor. In order to exit the hotel, we had to take an elevator up to the 38th floor and then take a separate elevator back down to the first floor. However, that is really a minor complaint.Any trip to Tokyo would not be complete without a stay at this hotel. It is definitely worth the cost, especially if this is your first time in Japan.","Dallas, Texas","CWinTX</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",38,5.0

It's somewhat reminiscent of the Park Hyatt, which may still have the nicest rooms, but you are steps from Mitsukoshi Department Store and the subway, and a short walk to Tokyo Station. The business district in the area has a complementary shuttle bus that connects the station basically to the hotel.

The decision to stay at the MOTYO was made after the repeated recommendations of a couple of friends.Online reservation was painless and efficient, what has followed after the automated email confirmation is the reason to my first Trip Advisor review. Shortly after the automated email, I was greeted by a more personalised email from the Reservations Team and later, Ms. Yoko Sumida and her colleagues from the Concierge Team. Since then, they have helped me make half a dozen dining reservations, made restaurant recommendations, floral arrangements for my wife's birthday, birthday cakes, transportation arrangement from Narita Airport to the Ski Resort that I will be staying at 7 days prior to my arrival at MOTYO, in-room amenities for kids and the list goes on. While all of these arrangements have been taken care of in the most possibly detailed way.

Naturally the views are superb (especially in the evening) with the lobby & main bar being at the top floor and the rooms being located below. The rooms are very well appointed with the same style as the refurbished Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong. We had a Deluxe room viewing eastwards with a relatively large size for Tokyo (about 50 sqmeters). The rooms facing westwards (towards the Imperial Palace) are more expensive but their views is probably more impressive.The bathroom is separated from the bedroom with a glass panel but you can close the stores if you wish to do so. The shower area does not have a curtain or a glass door. Instead, the whole shower area is an open space next to the bath which is typically Japanese. (Japanese people will shower first before slipping into a hot bath tub).All bathroom amenities are presented in a superb lacquered box and this is so far the only hotel I visited where they provide you with a small bottle of pressurized shaving cream alongside their razor kit!Being extremely recent, the main switches are all electronically commanded and quite intuitive to use. Note that there is a ""service box"" next to the door where the staff will put the daily newspaper or shoes (complimentary shoe-shine service at night) without having to open your door (pretty much like the Peninsula in Hong Kong).Service is very efficient and friendly but this is usually the norm in Japan. The Italian restaurant on the first floor has a nice buffet.Only downside is the location since Nihombashi is mainly a business district (the Tokyo Stock Exchange is nearby) so you need to take the subway (station is just below the hotel) or a taxi if you wish to go out (Ginza/Shinjuku/Shibuya/Roppongi). Note that the Mitsui tower is mainly an office tower with the Mandarin Oriental on top, so at street level you might not notice the main entrance of the hotel which is slightly off the main road. Also take a hotel address card to show to taxi drivers since some of them do not know this recent hotel. (Mine dropped me off in front of the Mitsui tower entrance instead of the proper hotel entrance, so that I had to drag my luggage in several escalators before finding my way to the hotel)Best option to/from Narita Airport is the ""friendly airport limousine"" which is a bus service between the airport and the main hotels in Tokyo. When going back to Narita, you can directly buy the tickets at the hotel concierge and the bus will stop in front of the hotel.Overall a beautiful city hotel from the Mandarin Oriental chain which adds to the stiff competition of 5* hotels in Tokyo!",london,"pickylulu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>london</strong>",6,4.0

The service was fabulous from the moment we approached the entrance of the hotel- one chap whisked our luggage off via a cargo lift, and we were greated and taken to reception via the normal lift. Check in was fabulously quick, we were allocated a room earlier than the normal check in time, and our luggage was ready and waiting in the room for us when we got there. Brilliant. We had a card from the front desk staff wishing us a happy honeymoon, and the girl who brought us a refreshing drink in our room was very sweet and was helping us with suggestions about how to get around the city and where to go. The rooms are huge and my husband couldn't stop playing with all the gadgets! The tv is bigger than our entire flat back home! The bathroom is great - lovely deep bath and walk in shower, perfect for a soak to get rid of the jet lag (we saw sunrise almost every day in Japan, but rather than spoiling the holiday, it was actually very special as the view out of the window as the sun rises is breathtaking). Another nice touch was the aromatherapy oil which was left for us on our second day, and all of the little trinkets in each drawer you look in (hair brush, fan, every connector for every computer you could ever imagine etc) We left a similar review to this on their in room comment card and got a lovely letter from the hotel manager when we returned to the UK saying that he had shown our comments to his staff to ""boost morale"". THe only thing that could have made it better is if he offered us a free night at a Mandarin Oriental of our choice to show his gratitude! It is expensive, but its worth every penny.

Whilst the formal spaces are as grand as you'd expect, it is really the efficient and caring service that sets the tone. As non-Japanese-speaking travelers to Japan know, this is one city where the concierge desk can make the difference and the team here was spot on, with prompt responses to pre-trip inquiries, good communication about what to expect (quality of seats in a venue, for example), and a no-question-too-small attitude.Rooms are large for Tokyo. The breakfast buffet is extraordinarily good with an array of Japanese, Chinese, and Western choices, and every piece of fruit arranged just so. The gym is excellent.

We stayed in a Premium Grand Room which was huge, decorated with modern japanese elegance and having every amenity you could possibly conceive.But I thought I could provide a little more information about its location, which we also found hard to fault. Firstly there is little doubt that the Metro subway is the only way to go and having two lines accessible from within the hotel building (in the basement) was great. We reached every corner of Tokyo without having to change lines more than once and navigating the subway is quite easy if you are used to subways.Also the immediate environs of the hotel were unexpectantly modern, spacious, quiet and clean. The hotel is also right next door to a huge department store which has a food basement that has to be seen to be believed. But if you also take the opportunity to walk around the very safe side streets, you will find a wide vareity of traditional shops and great restaurants that are well worth a visit. For example we found a Tempura restaraunt 10 minutes from the hotel that was 100 years old (what an experience). Also the Imperial Palace East gardens are only about a 15 minute pleasant walk away, which is somewhere you just have to go (especially in Spring).There is no doubt that the MOT is very expensive, but so is Tokyo in general. However this was one of the very few visits I walked away from feeling totally satisfied and totally enthused about everything.","Duncraig, Australia","GazPerth</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Duncraig, Australia</strong>",73,5.0

Maybe that is where we went wrong. We were surprised to find that the Hotel is hidden away in a large office building (it has no street presence). We were standing only 50 metres away from the Hotel but had to ask someone where it was. On entering the doors of a large office building, we had to look all around before finding a discreet door tucked away in the corner of a building containing shops. We took the lift up to the 38th floor where the lobby is located. Normally a hotel lobby is a relaxing place where you can sit down and organise yourself before checking in. The Mandarin lobby is soulless and makes you feel conspicuous and uncomfortable. We can’t really put our finger on it rather than say that being in the lobby felt a bit like waiting to see someone for a job interview.We feel this Hotel is better suited to the business and not leisure traveller. Maybe you can appreciate it more if you are not paying for it. The service is slick and professional but forced/awkward and doesn’t put you at ease. It’s as if they are trying too hard but not really wanting to act in this manner.We booked a Corner room at Yen 19,000 (GBP 560 or USD 1,000 per night). The view was amazing. The room was small but we were expecting that. The view from the bathtub in particular, was really good until the windows fogged up! There is not much space to lay out a suitcase. So compact, yet nice.A small point which annoyed us… we were charged for 8 cups of green tea which appeared to be free as displayed, but alas no. Only when we checked our online bill, did we see that this was GBP 8 pounds each. On further inspection, the mini-bar price list showed that coffee was free but tea was charged. This seemed very strange for such an expensive hotel.The concierge staff were very good and confirmed our flights for us and even booked us 2 tickets on the train to the airport. A nice touch.With regard to the common areas, sadly, Japan has a culture of smoking (although not as much as we were expecting). As all of the bars and restaurants are open to the lobby, the smell of cigarettes emanates throughout the common areas and is particularly noticeable in the morning… yuk! The breakfast room has amazing views and the service is excellent. We ordered eggs from the chef and he found our table to deliver them when done. However, there is a problem with the air-conditioning (which seems to be a common problem in Japan). In particular, if you go down for breakfast at 6:30am (as we did on one day), make sure you are wearing beach shorts and a t-shirt as the air-con only seems to start at that time. The sweat was running down our back…All in all, the hotel is good, but not great. We were expecting something over and above say, the Oberoi chain in India, but alas it’s not a touch on the Oberoi Udaipur. I would recommend that the Mandarin Managers undertake a fact finding mission there to see an amazing hotel. At the prices charged by the Mandarin Tokyo they need to up their game.On the other hand, if you are not personally paying for it, then you’ll probably find the Mandarin perfectly adequate (but we doubt outstanding which is what you expect at that price point).","London, United Kingdom","KV1234</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",323,3.0

We are in a two bedroom suite which is huge by any countires standard stylish and beautiful. We travel extensively so It takes alot to 'wow' us but I can honestly say every moment of our 5 night stay here has been magnifiicent. I don't want to leave here! Usually when you stay anywhere there is a list of both Pros and Cons....I can't think of any Cons so let me just give you the Pros:Check in - Flawless and all of the 20 or so floor staff knew who we were and addressed us by name. Note during our entire stay when requesting something from concierge ect and I have said would you like my room number? Staff have agian used my name and have known my room number! I don't know how they do this but it's a really personal nice touch. We arrived on an early morning flight several hours before any hotels check in. We were given a room with no fuss and not the normal we are doing you a favour, we don't have to give you a room until 3pm attitude you sometimes find in the industry. We were escorted to the room and shown all the entertainment system, blind systems, light systems ect (Japan is a country of techno and this hotel lives up to the standard there). The room was spotlessly clean as anticipated and uses material, wood and stone in different textures to create a relaxing beautiful space. We went out every day but didn't really want to leave the room. The children were catered for beautifully with their own size gowns, slippers and welcome ameneties. Again nice touch. Welcome amenaties for adults as well.Products - So may products to use during your stay means you don't have to worry if you forget somthing they even provide hairbrushes and PJ's. Room is service twice daily and at turndown they also provide you with aromatic lavender oil to help relax you. Oh and the bed......unbelievable. The toilet also unbelievable (more technology), one of those toto toilets with warmed seat, lots of jets and then self flushes when you are finished. The bath in the master suite looks out over the Tokyo skyline also.Room service - 5 star restaurant grade meaning you could get away with not leaving the room to eat. They made to order things for the kids that weren't on the menu at reasonable price. Breakfast buffet had a wonderful selection that did not have that buffet wilted look about it. Fresh and sublime. We are booked to try ONE of the michelin star restaurant tomorrow - there is three inhouse! So undoubtly you can't go wrong with food here.Location - You are right above the Japan Metro with easy access to anywhere in Tokyo. We have had fun navigating our way around this quick clean and effiecient means of travel. Tokyo is a really safe city for tourists and I we haven't seen any seedy side or felt uncomfortable anywhere. Spa - spent a few hours escaping here. Two whirlpools, steam room, sauna again with the most amazing views - I watched the sun set over Mt Fuji there tonight. Very clean with washing before entering and in true Japan bathhouse style in the buff. I am booked for a treatment tomorrow you have to book well in advance as they are the best in town.In summary as I could go on and on this place is amazing. This is not a hotel but an experience and one of which we have been very lucky to have found.

In fact, the MO San Fran's GM acted as a liaison with the MO Tokyo on our behalf - what wonderful customer service! From the very moment we arrived at the hotel to our departure - we were completely wowed in every sense - it was so hard to leave. We were warmly greeted (they knew our names within 30 seconds and continued to greet us by name throughout our stay) and check in was gracious and efficient. We stayed in Room 3406 and were afforded a magnificant view of Tokyo's skyline and Mount Fuji. The room category was Premier Deluxe King and the room and its amenities were top notch. The room was huge with a large walk in closet and floor to ceiling windows; the interior decorating beautiful and comfortable. The lighting was excellent and bathroom, shower, and toiletries were all great. As other reviewers have mentioned, the TOTO toilet will amaze you. The breakfast buffet was excellent with just the right amount of options and variety - it was a pleasant way to start each day. The fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee were excellent too and the staff were wonderfully attentive and friendly. Room service (I ordered coffee for the mornings) was excellent and prompt. The workout center was top notch with new treadmills, ellipticals, and Cybex machines - all with a great view of Tokyo while you work off those calories.The Concierge team was phenomenal and assisted us with the purchase of bullet train tickets to Kyoto, car service, ryokan suggestions, etc. prior to our arrival. The team's responsiveness via email was incredible and throrough. Once we arrived, the team provided wonderful sightseeing and restaurant recommendations (be sure try their shabu shabu restaurant recommendation!) and excellent maps. The hotel is located on top of a Metro stop so it doesn't get any easier to tour the city. The Metro system itself is easy to navigate and much quicker (and cheaper) than using a taxi. The hotel is also located next door to one of Tokyo's main department stores - be sure to stop by the basement's food department.One minor negative was that we had dinner one night at the hotel's Signatures restaurant and to be honest, we were a bit disappointed in light of its one Michelin star rating. We opted for the tasting menu and although all of the courses were beautifully presented and the service excellent, some of the courses were a bit sub par. The chef (s) are Austrian and the menu highlighted Austrian fare rather than French inspired courses. Several of the courses were very heavy (i.e., lots of meat, starch, and gravy) and the portion sizes were a bit large considering there were 7+ courses to navigate. But, it still was a pleasant and enjoyable evening overall.Although the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo is not inexpensive, it is worth every single penny and spoils its guests in every respect. We were constantly greeted with warm smiles, attentiveness, and graciousness. I can't say enough on how wonderful this property and staff are.

I used American Express Platinum to book the Mandarin Deluxe Room. Upon my arrival, the hotel has already upgraded me to the Premier Grand Room (a two level upgrade), along with complimentary breakfast and lunch. I stayed at the hotel during my two segments in Tokyo, visiting Kyoto and Hakone during the interim. I inquired the hotel staffs (most of them spoke fluent English) about the Hakone Freepass before I left for my day trip to Nikko.The hotel staff not only offered to get the Freepass for me (at no extra service charge), but also included a whole lot of local information about Hakone when I picked up the Freepass the same night. The hotel also offered me to store my luggage during my 3-trip the Kyoto and Hakone and stated the luggage would be placed in my room upon my return. Room: The Premier Grand Room is large by any reasonable standards. The walk-in closet area was spacious enough to probably put six full sized luggage. As mentioned by other members, the room included every amenities imaginable from a bathroom to work area. The cotton swap even had ear picks at the other end. The room also offered the most advanced washlet from Toto, Neorest 600, with automatic cyclone flush. As can be seen in my attached photos, the view from the room was impeccable. The hotel offered both wireless and wire internet connection at 1800 yen per 24-hour period.Service: Besides the items mentioned above, the hotel staffs made me feel truly welcome from the first moment I stepped off my taxi to the time I left the hotel. The hotel staffs were always filled with smiles everywhere in the hotel. Food: The selection for breakfast at K'Shiki was not great (compared to Peninsula Beijing), but was certainly much better than Park Hyatt Tokyo. At 2800 yen (or 3800 yen with eggs), I considered the price very reasonable. The selection for the buffet lunch at Ventaglio on the second floor also was not great, but at 2800 yen, I felt I got the food and service that I expected to pay more than $90 USD in any hotel restaurants in New York City. It was actually less expensive than my bento meal at Tokyo station. Location: The location was about 7 minutes by taxi from Tokyo Station. The taxi fare was the starting 710 yen. I took taxi ride 4 times and all taxi drivers recognized the location of hotel with ease. The hotel is right by the Bank of Japan. Spa: The use of the fitness center was free of charge to the hotel guests, but the wet area cost addition 6000 yen. I did not use either facilities during my stay there. Overall: The hotel was in the same price range as Park Hyatt, Peninsula and other top notch hotels in Tokyo; however, the room and service were certainly better than these hotels.

This hotel has a reputation for outstanding service, and not only did it meet our expectations, the standard of service exceeded our expectations. They managed to single handedly save our trip as I was foolish enough to leave my Camera bag on the train as we arrived into Tokyo from the airport. The friendly lady who checked us in not only spent the evening negotiating with Japan Rail, getting them to search for and recover the bag, but also, one of the conceirge staff lived out where the the bag was being held, and he volunteered to go and pick up the bag himself as it was being held way on the outskirts of Tokyo, near his home and bring it back when he started his next shift. It was amazing service, and executed perfectly, thanks to Mandarin Oriental Staff I was able to get my camera back and capture many memories of this amazing country. We couldn't thank them enough.We also wanted to take the Bullet Train to Nikko in two days time, but were a bit worried about how to go about doing this, so we asked the concierce, and they actually went down to the station themselves, booked the tickets and they appeared under our door in a beautifully presented envelope. Again, amazing service.The room was really nice, oriental feel with two large and extremely comfortable beds. The massive Flat screen TV was another great touch. The bathroom was great, with a deep spa which had its own flat screen tv. I couldn't really fault the room at all, it was just perfect. Some negative reviewer stated that there was no coffee and tea making facilities in the room, but that definately wasn't the case for us, and my partner can testify that it was really nice coffee! Our room as on the 35th floor, and featured extremely good views over tokyo, especially at night when the city lights up!The Buffet Breakfast probably wasn't the best buffet i've experienced. It was small without the massive variety that I love in many 5 star hotels, but everything was nicely presented and it was a pleasent experience as it wasn't completely overrun with people like some breakfast buffets, infact there were only about 4 other people there, we got the impression that most people had room service, as the room service menu seemed to have ALOT more variety, so we tried that the next day and it was magnificent. Beautiful Belgian waffles!We had Room service for dessert one night and a lunch as well, both were excellent quality, some of the best room service i've had. Unfortunately we couldn't test any of their other restaurants for dinner, preferring to eat out at the Ginza.As far as location goes, it's probably not IDEAL for leisure travellers, but Tokyo is such a massive city with attractions scattered accross a variety of precincts, so each area has its benefits, but if you want to be in the thick of the action, Shibuya or Shinjuku are probably the best places to stay. But in saying this, we found the Mandarin Oriental's location just fine! It's located on top of a subway station, which is great, with direct access to the popular Ginza district and its high end shopping, eating and the famous sony show room, and also direct access to the magnificent temples of Asakusa, so all in all it's a pretty good spot to be honest. It's relatively quiet as well, which for many people is a plus. All in all, a fabulous stay, with very memorable service.","Melbourne, Australia","Cameron85</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",82,5.0

While quite pricey, this hotel simply cannot be faulted. The service was impeccable. They were all very attentive from the moment we arrived at the hotel until we left. They even assisted me in finding certain japanese products I was asked to pick up while in japan. They found the products at a discount which they passed on to me and left them in my room after returning from a long day touring the city. They simply passed the cost onto my checkout bill. The room we got was in the 36th floor and had incredible views of Tokyo. Out of all the hotel rooms I have ever stayed at, I would say this room was the most well thought out. The bathroom shower had every type of shower head you can think of. The tub was deep and had a small flat screen tv and its own beautiful view of the city. The toilet had the fully automatic japanese-style bidet with every conceivable setting for your derrier. The bathroom was also well stocked with the usual amenities, bathrobes, and towels. The bedroom had a huge flat screen HD TV, the bed was large and comfortable with large view windows. The hotel also provided a small bottle of incense/fragrance that you can use to make the room smell like a spa. They also provided you with separately shrink-wrapped bedroom slippers and comfortable japanese yukatas (robes) for loungewear. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The buffet breakfasts were not as as elaborate as other hotels we have stayed in but the selection provided is still quite nice. Staff at the restaurant again were efficient and attentive and you cannot ask for a better setting to have such a nice breakfast with panoramic views of the city. This hotel is one of the best out there. If you can afford it, I would recommend you stay here.","Bellevue, Washington","jinapsan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bellevue, Washington</strong>",76,5.0

Staff are very efficient, from the moment you arrive they know your name and strive to give service. Especially, enjoyed that bell staff run to press the buttons in the lift. Everyone was very helpful, one bell staffer escorted me to an international ATM (in the Post Office in the building) after I struggled to find one.The location is good in that Ginza is nearby and you have a metro stop in the building. I recommend the metro as Ginza traffic can be awful.The rooms are modern and large but lack much charm. Our room had a separate tub with an odd shape and an adjoining unenclosed shower making half the bathroom a wet room. While we showered you could feel a draft as well. That being said it was a waterfall shower and well appointed. The room featured a good size work desk and large plasma TV that proved hard to use. Another issue we had is that the AC did not really cool our room even when set to 18 C. Breakfast at the buffet was fair and service was very good. Had a great pizza for lunch one day at the same place. Really enjoyed the bar for a drink, the golfball sized MO logo ice cube in my scotch was very cool. Prices are very high but you are in Tokyo so that is normal. We used the metro extensively and toured the Ginza area that we really liked. If you can afford a hotel in the price range the MO Tokyo is a solid choice. We also spent 3 nights at the Park Hyatt which is great but requires expensive taxis to get around. Highly recommend Kyubei Restaurant in Ginza. The food is divine in the chefs choice style of Japanese. Dinner for 2 will match your room rate but do go if you can and like Japanese.",Florida,"FlyOneWorld</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Florida</strong>",477,5.0

This hotel comes with glowing reviews from every published travel magazine. A near perfect 5-star review ratings in tripadvisor. The #1 hotel in Tokyo and the first to win the distinguished 6-star award that the hotel proudly displayed at the entrance. More important, the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo in particular was supposed to have near “legendary great service”, a traditional strong trait of the Mandarin Oriental brand. So things can’t possibly go wrong, right? Wrong. Very wrong. Unlike most other casual reviewers, I admit I’m rather fussy and discerning traveler and have seen and experienced the best that the hotel industry in Asia has to offer. While difficult to please, I do have certain basic expectations what a 5-star hotel should be and judge according to the value they deliver for the price. The Mandarin Oriental due to it’s reputation, charge the highest room rate in Tokyo and accordingly, so does my expectation. This review is a bit long so do bear with me.“Service” saga at the Mandarin Oriental TokyoUpon arrival by taxi, my luggage was promptly taken care of and I was escorted to the 38th floor lobby. Check-In was longer than usual as the front desk staff apologize and said that he had to “search for my room”. I wonder why this was necessary as they had my firm booking on hand and I have told them my arrival time. Surely, they should have allocated the room before my arrival as all premium 5-star hotels do. Another staff then escorted me to my room, a Mandarin Deluxue Room. Upon entering the room, I was taken aback. The room feels cramp and small. There is a small bathroom with only one sink. Much of the space was taken up by the King Size bed and a bulky sofa by the window. There is no walk-in closet. In fact, there isn’t even a designated space to put luggage. The only place to put the luggage is next to the bed. I am sure this room is not 50m2. If it is really 50m2, they should have easily designed a bigger bathroom and incorporated at least a luggage storage space instead. I immediately told the hotel staff that I was not happy with this room and asked if there were bigger rooms available. Bewildered, she replied that she need to check and Front Desk will contact me. Ten minutes later, no calls. I called Front Desk myself and was told immediately that “all rooms are fully booked and we only have the Mandarin deluxe available”. I was skeptical as it was not a peak season and the way he answered so quickly most like means that he did not really checked. I told him again I was not happy with the size of the room and asked to change. Again the reply was that “the larger premier rooms and suites and are all not available”. I repeat again my demand this time in much firmer tones and insisted that he checked again and said I was not pleased with this smallish room that they assigned to me and asked him to check with his manager. Finally he replied that he “need to check”. After 5 mins, he called back and said that bigger rooms were now available. And he accompanied me to check the rooms myself. I decided to change to a Premier Room ( with additional room rate ) instead and even this room feels very small, but at least it has a walk in closet. However, the fact is the rooms were actually available, why was I told there were not in the first place? It just goes to show the front desk staff actually did not bothered to check initially. This kind of attitude is unacceptable in a hotel of this class. Next I started to notice that the room was absent of any welcome amenity of any kind. Not even a fruit basket. I asked the Front Desk staff that was assisting me on the change of room if there were any welcome amenity. Again he seems surprised by my request and said that he “will check”. I told him usually hotels of this class provide some basic welcome amenities such as a chocolates or tibits or at the worst case, at least a fruit basket. Furthermore, I reminded him that this should be automatically provided, not wait for the guest to request; otherwise, it’s not a welcome amenity. After a while, he called back to tell me that they do not have the welcome amenity that I asked for. Their welcome amenity is oranges. He even asked “Do you like us to bring the orange to your room?”. I was stunned. Oranges!!! How very “impressive” for a flagship hotel of the Mandarin Oriental Group! I must have been spoiled by the generous welcome amenities given by other hotels including both MO group’s own hotels in Hong Kong and the Peninsula Tokyo right before my stay at the MO Tokyo, which the Peninsula generously provided complimentary chocolates, biscuits, tibits and even a bottle of Peninsula’s signature Red wine. Anyway, I told him no thanks. The oranges did came eventually during turn down service, 3 puny size mandarin oranges. How very generous for a supposedly “6-star hotel”!Urging to have a cup of coffee in my room, I searched the mini-bar area and suddenly realized that no instant coffee was provided. How can that be missing? Even 3-star hotels provide coffee in their rooms. Perhaps the housekeeping forget to replenish the coffee? I called again asking where’s the coffee. Again I was told they “need to check”. Subsequently, I was told the hotel provided tea in the minibar. Yes, fine, but I’m a coffee drinker and not a tea drinker. Am I the first hotel guests in MO Tokyo that is a coffee drinker? Then the staff replied there do not have coffee in the room but he can called in-room dinning for me and bring up a cup of coffee which of course, comes with an astronomically price ( in-room dinning is generally very expensive in Tokyo ). So no thanks! Really, at the price they were charging, what’s the tremendous difficulty to put a few packets of instant coffee? The Peninsula Tokyo by the way comes with a Nepresso coffee machine with gourmet coffee standard in all rooms. By now, I really started to regret my stay at this hotel. Looking thru the room, while rather tastefully decorated, it is no where in the same league of luxury as the Peninsula or even the Ritz Carlton Tokyo that I have stayed before and not even as spacious and well equipped as the Four Seasons Marunouchi. There are insufficient plugs on the writing desk. No coffee machine ( as expected since the hotel doesn’t provide coffee), smallish bathroom with only one sink. There is a 45” Sharp LCD TV and a DVD player but no A/V sound system. Part of the walls have stains on it, indicating poor housekeeping. Connecting the iPod means playing the music thru the TV’s tin-can speakers which sound quite awful by the way. The bed is also nothing to write home about, standard 5-star hotel beds and the quality of the linens are below that of the Peninsula or Ritz Carlton ( both of which uses Frette linens ). They did provide a long pillow which I requested earlier but it was hard as rock and I didn’t use it. Getting tired of the mundane room, I left for the gym to get some exercise. Again this hotel couldn’t cease to annoy me. I was the only one using the gym and found the temperature to be too cold. The overhead air condition was blowing very cold air directly at me while I was working out on the thread mill. I requested the gym attendant to adjust the temperature as it was too cold. She said she “need to check” ( by the way, this always happen with this hotel, everything they “need to check” ). After 10 mins, it becomes freezing cold. I questioned the attendant again why such a simple request like adjusting the gym temperature is so difficult? Then another staff with better English told me that temperature adjustment in the gym can “only be done at engineering” and they are “working on it” so it will take some time !!!! I decided to leave the gym upon hearing this rather than freeze myself to death. The next day when I checked out, I noticed they bill the rate different from what I booked, ie higher. I show them my booking confirmation which after including the charges for the room upgrade, the figure is incorrect. Again, three of the front desk staff become confused and stared at that invoice punching their calculators while at a loss for words. Agitated, I told them to just go ahead to charge the credit card rather than waste time figuring out the difference. Finally, after like 10 mins staring at the printout, one of them explained that the extra cost is because the tax applied on the charges for the upgrade as well. How come they don’t even know their own billing system?The only place that I got some genuine 5-star service from this hotel was at Signature, the Michelin star rated French fine dining restaurant located in the hotel. Not only was the food delicious, the service was also great and the chef even personally came out and thank me for my patronage, a gesture that I really appreciate. I also took the opportunity to request an empty box to put my bottle of wine and they got it for me right away without confusing stares ( I dreaded making this request to the hotel staff ). I requested also for an additional order of dessert to be brought to my room later than evening and it arrived exactly on time and with complimentary coffee!. Finally the Captain at the restaurant can speak perfect English so I don’t have to go thru any hassle with my requests! He is the only Japanese staff I encountered in the whole hotel that can speak fluent English. If only the other aspects of the hotel were as good as my experience in Signature, this hotel would have deserved its reputation. Common Areas and ViewThe hotel common areas were indeed very beautiful with magnificent views. The entire lobby contains two wall of glass that allow the evening view pouring in. All common areas are beautifully adorned with either Japanese artwork or rich panel wood. Returning to my room in the evening and looking at the mesmerizing view of the Tokyo’s evening skyline, momentarily, I was even tempted to forgive all the service hiccups that this hotel put me through. Ultimately, simply having great views is not enough to qualify as a great hotel in my books. The Ritz Carlton at Roppongi also have great views and miles better service than the Mandarin Oriental. The hotel is located in the Marunouchi business district so there’s not much of interest there for shopping or night life. ConclusionIn summary, with the exception of Signature Restaurant, this hotel’s service stinks. Everything they will answer they “need to check” and the level of English proficiency among the staff is the lowest among all the Tokyo hotels I have stayed in so far. Sure, they are all very polite and will smile and even bow to you ( and they does this a lot ) but when you need to get something done and any request out of the ordinary, the staff become easily dazed and confused. I cynically wonder if all these smiling and bowing were simply done to disguise their incompetence. So to conclude, this hotel is a major disappointment and does not live up to its reputation that it supposedly deserved. I paid top rates for this hotel at Yen70,000++ a night plus another Yen3,000++ to switch to a bigger room, rates which are already more expensive than the Peninsula. Yet, comparing every single aspect with the Peninsula from location to room quality to amenities to service, the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo simply falls flat on the face, greatly surpass by the Peninsula and the other hotels that I have stayed in Tokyo. It’s also the worst Mandarin Oriental hotel that I have tried so far. The only redeeming quality of this hotel is the great view it offers. Perhaps this hotel used to be great but they must be getting complacent which explained the falling standards. If they failed to please discerning frequent travelers like me, I see little chance that this hotel can compete with the new Peninsula which in my opinion is miles better and the true #1 hotel in Tokyo. Already, I can see there are many more guests in the Peninsula compared to the Mandarin Oriental as the lobby of the Peninsula is always very busy while the MO is quiet. It’s a real pity as I’ve been a big fan of the Mandarin Oriental group. The management of the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo better wake up and re-train their staff or they will see more business loss to the Peninsula. As for me, the decision has already been made. I would not come back to this hotel again, except perhaps to patronize the Signature restaurant. For the great views and the great service and food at Signature, I award this hotel a 2 star rating, and I’m already being generous. I know this review doesn’t agree with the rest of the reviews here but these are my actual experience and for anyone who has also stayed at the Peninsula Tokyo will know what I mean, there’s simply no comparison.",JAKARTA,"BENLEE123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>JAKARTA</strong>",775,2.0

The lobby and the bars around the lobby are simply stunning. Very cool decor, up 38 floors with amazing views of Tokyo. On the downside, the drinks in the bar were $21 USD per drink and they were pretty small, so after 4 drinks a nearly $200 tab felt excessive. We didn't try the tapas bar but it looked great and other reviews rave about it so i wouldn't miss that.The location is in a bit of a business/dept store area, but its actually really central to everything, relatively speaking, given how huge Tokyo is. You are very close to Ginza, Tokyo station (hub for trains all over Japan), and the Tsukiji fish market.Rooms are nice, but definitely on the expensive side. At $750 US per night (what it comes to after that 18% tax you dont see in the rate) the rooms could be a little bit more exciting. I usually dont mind paying up for a great hotel room, but we were out exploring most of the time and really only got to enjoy the room to sleep.This is the only hotel I have every stayed at in Tokyo. Given that everything at this hotel level is very pricey, I would recommend it.Its beautiful, the staff is helpful, and its calming to return to after spending a day out on the mania that is Tokyo. Oh, one more thing, we were in our room on the 37th floor when an earthquake hit. The building swayed and creaked, but that is what its supposed to do apparently.

Whether it was directions, use of subway, restaurant reservations, or restaurant recommendations they exceeded our expectations. The kicker was when we left and arranged the limousine bus service. I told them we were spending our last night at an airport hotel. When we went to get on the bus they provided me with a detailed map of where to find the next hotel, how to get the free shuttle bus, and the specific times to get the shuttle. The detail was amazing, and I had not even requested any of the information, which was extremely helpful. They refused to take a tip and my husband had to secretly hand them a tip to be discrete.

Exceptional TV and Multimedia equipment (a set of cables makes it possible to use the flat panel LCD TV as output for your laptop). Service was perfect throughout. Breakfast was fine, perhaps not as impressive as the rest.The most memorable event was the dinner at the ""Tapas"" (the name of the restaurant) Molecular Cuisine restaurant. Because the restaurant only serves 6 guests for two services each evening we thought it would be impossible to get in, yet the hotel staff spared no effort to find us space - eventually by adding two seats. My advice however from now on is to book the restaurant in advance not to put staff through too much pressure! BTW the Tapas is really value for money (around JPY 30,000 for two with 24 tapas each).

Staying at the MOTYO, they are. We had a wonderful 3 nights there earlier this month. It is quite spooky that they greet you by name when you arrive to check-in at the lobby. My guess is that they take a quick peek at the luggage labels as they retrieve those from you at street level, but how several of them remember your names a couple of days later is indeed impressive.The hotel is wonderfully situated, being right above a Metro station, and even better, on the Ginza line which goes to all the places you want to see, or links to other lines, and is next door to the magnificent Mitsukoshi department store. I could easily have spent many more hours and yen in there. There were also several convenience stores nearby, selling all sorts of interesting stuff, especially great Japanese chocolates.Visiting in August as we did, we were never going to have clear views of Mt Fuji, and although our room on the 35th (!!) floor didn't look over the prized Westerly view, we had the bonus of being able to see the 'Golden Flame' (?Turd) of the Asahi brewery. Besides, after dark, all views are equal.Many people have gushed about the glass-walled bathroom, but although handsome, I must admit that this is highly impractical. When ever either of us went to the loo in the night, torch in hand to find the way, the other was instantly awoken - the situation was not helped by the electrical toilets of which the Japanese are so keen. This whirred and flushed all of the first night, leading us to unplug it last thing at night after that, replugging it in the morning. The shower and bath were gorgeous, though, the latter being deceptively large enough for a decent soak in after busy days pounding the Tokyo streets.Adam and the rest of the concierge team were really helpful, and the eateries they recommended were great - a wonderful sushi bar and a shabu-shabu place, both within walking distance of the hotel (our experiences better than Bob and Charlotte in Lost in Translation). There were lots of other good places which we discovered ourselves just by walking a bit.The breakfast buffet was good, although not quite as good as that of the ANA Hotel in Kyoto, with an interesting little starter drink of brown sugar and rice vinegar (sounds disgusting but I liked it), and the eggs, I bet, come from very happy hens, judging by what they're fed on!We were very envious of the people just arriving as we were leaving, and we will definitely return to the MOTYO when we go back to Tokyo.",Huddersfield,"M_and_RHuddersfield</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Huddersfield</strong>",35,5.0

I can summarize our experience by simply stating that this is one of the best hotels in the world, and we rate the service there as the finest we have EVER encountered in our travels.We enjoyed a great flight with excellent service on Singapore Airlines (one of three best airlines in the world) from Los Angeles to Tokyo. When we arrived at Narita Airport, two people with the hotel’s “Meet & Greet” service were there at the gate when we got off the plane, and helped us negotiate the airport and quickly through customs/immigration, then on to the Mandarin’s Deluxe Van that would take us to the hotel. Our experience has shown us that although expensive, these two services are well worth paying for when arriving at a big, complex airport in a non-English speaking country. We departed Narita at about 6:30pm and the drive took approximately 1 hour & 15 minutes. The Senior Guest Relations Officer – Takashi Kurono – met us when we arrived and escorted us directly to our room, where he took care of the check-in procedure. Takashi was terrific and gave us much good advice in finalizing our plans for touring Tokyo. He also followed-up up each meeting with excellent data and maps to help us with our self-guided tours. We then visited the famed Ginza area that night.This was our first trip to Japan and we rank it among the most fascinating places we have visited. Tokyo is amazing, and could be best described as a much cleaner & newer New York City, filled with extremely nice, respectful people. We had no problem getting around the city by ourselves and only used a guide/translator and driver for a day and a half, when we were visiting artists in remote studios. The trains and subways were fairly easy to use and there was always some nice local person around who would help us figure out nuances of the ticket machine or location of the train. Would recommend spending a full day using the Yamanote Line train that makes an oval loop around the city. It runs above ground so you get to see much of Tokyo while riding. We began at 9:30am (to avoid earlier rush hour period) by walking 10 minutes from our hotel to Tokyo Station, bought “all day” tickets and boarded the train. We then got off for walking tours at the Shinbashi, Shibuya, Harajuku, and Shinjuku stations, on the way to looping back around to our starting point late that night. Had a great dinner (and view) at the New York Bar & Grill on 52nd floor of Park Hyatt Hotel in Shinzuku, where “Lost in Translation” was filmed (recommend watching before first trip to Tokyo). The Mitsukoshi Department store located next to the hotel was our favorite in the city. We visited the Ginza area several times for great shopping and restaurants and other interesting sites like the Sony Building and some museums. Also took the subway back from Ginza to the stop right next to our hotel. The Imperial Palace Garden is only a short 15 minute walk from the hotel and very beautiful to see.We also liked visiting the following areas: Ueno Park, Asakusa, Akihabara, Roppongi Hills, Hamarikyu Garden, Shiba Park, Tokyo Tower, and a boat cruise down the Simuda River.Had room service at the hotel every morning and a number of nights, and service and food were terrific. Tried the Sense restaurant one night and it was great. Our only disappointment with the hotel was their currency exchange charge of about 7.5%, which is the highest we can remember encountering at any hotel. Would recommend walking to the bank next door to the hotel where the charge was only 1% for Travelers Checks and 2% for USD conversion to Japanese Yen.Following our stay in Tokyo, we planned to take the Shinkansen bullet train from Tokyo Station to Osaka. The hotel took care of everything, booking and acquiring our first class (green car) tickets on the newest trains – Nozomi 700 series – which provide an excellent 2 ½ ride. They arranged a Deluxe Van to take us to the station and amazingly, one of the Bellmen escorted us there and through the chaotic station to our train, and also pulled several of our heavy bags from the Van all the way onto the train. We arrived at the station 30 minutes before our departure, so we could be first in line boarding our train car and be able to store our 3 heavy bags in the slot at the back of the car. The Mandarin also arranged with our Osaka hotel (Ritz Carlton) for them to meet us at the train platform when we arrived there and take us to the hotel. There we spend 1.5 days touring Osaka, then went with a guide on train to Kyoto for day trip, and repeated same process in Nara the next day. We stayed in Osaka (rather than Kyoto or Nara) because we were then able to fly direct from Osaka Kansai airport back to America (SFO) on United Airlines, which was very good (only one level below Singapore) and seemingly unrelated to the quality of its domestic service.",Texas,"investr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Texas</strong>",18,5.0

Tokyo twice, once before travelling to Kyoto and then again upon return to Tokyo...a total of six nights. We had a mixed experience. The lobby is stunning in a very chic and original way. There is a pretty happening bar scene. The location is good for business but we were leisure travellers and to get some of the newer upscale shopping areas and art museums I think the RC has a better location. Service was mixed. The bellman were outstanding , check in quick considering when we arrived we were disappointed with our room size and could not get an upgrade unless we paid $300 more which we did. I had read about their spa and was excited to check it out. We were really covering a lot of ground touring every day and normally I would have gone for a massage probably every other day. The spa told us that we could only use the jacuzzi between 6:30 am and 9:00 am or pay $160 to use it. We found this ridiculous since we were paying approximately $1000/night to stay in a Mandarin suite. We also tried to get massages and found it near impossible to get in. Also, strangely the ""intro massage rate "" was $160/hr and $340 for 80 minutes which made little to no sense. We found ourselves going to the RC and 4 S to get a massage a the end of the day and both were very welcoming. When I finally went to the spa manager to tell her about out difficulties with the spa she apologized, walked me back to my room and handed me her card suggesting that she call in advance if I stay in another MO hotel. I found this a bit strange b/c I didn't think they were able to provide a reasonable welcome to the spa in their own hotel.The rooms are gorgeous with great bathrooms and loads of bathroom amenites. Mitsukoshi is practically in the basement with the world's greatest dept store food market in their basement. The concierges gave us 2 very poor dinner steers, one on our last night of our trip to a brightly lit sushi bar in an office building that sat about 12. They told us it was one of the best sushi bars in Tokyo. They were out of tuna, yellowtail and eel when we ordered and unapologetically substituted with other fish as if we would not know the difference. When we told the MO concierge she was apoogetic saying that they were out of everything b/c it was 9:00 on a Friday night?! That said, the Tapas Molecular Bar right in the hotel lobby was on of the greatest dining experiences we have ever had and actually an excellent value at $125pp for 25 courses!! This is a no miss. All in all, we had a nice experience but would go to the RC next time inTokyo both for the location which is better for leisure travelers and also for the warmer staff. They were much friendlier to us as outside guests on two visits than we found anyone other than the doormen to be at the MO during 6 nights/ two stays.",los angeles,"tripindicular1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>los angeles</strong>",189,4.0

This was however our first trip to Japan. I choose the MO because of all the great reviews. Therefore, our expectations were extremely high. Premisis - About the building , the entrance, the lobby, spas , rooms , bars etc, all I can say is that I was flabbergasted. I have worked before on several hotel building projects, and I have a tendency to look at the quality of craftmanship in the design and fitting. I try to see where they have cut the corners, or made a small mistake. After spending a week at the MO in Tokyo, I found nothing! Although it seems not possible to me, they did not cut any corners! They have simply taken the best materials available, and applied them in an absolutely fantastic solution. I am not talking about one part of the hotel, I mean everywhere. From the entrance door to the bathrooms, it is perfect. (Small tip - have a look at the floor in the elevators or the stairs going from the lobby down to the bar. It is a black marble, but look for the blue highlights which shimmer in the day light. Amazing touch!)Service - This is by far the best trained hotel staff we have ever encountered. I cannot say enough about the front desk and concierge team. As in a previous review, we have been surprised by their friendlyness and competence in making our stay most enjoyable. From a fast check to a perfect check-out it was great. (Tip- the counters of the reception are beatifully lined in leather. small but nice touch. Also, if you are presented a pen to sign your bill or anything else. No flimsy plastic pens, but substantial writing pieces.)The concierge team has organised a guide, recommended and book restaurants, organised train tickets, recommened shopping tours etc. We could not have been more pleased. But to top it off, it was not the perfect rooms, the great spa, the wonderful views, great room service etc, that mattered, it was the true feeling that they care about you as a guest. This is something which begins in the traditional Japanese culture, but is perfected in the selection and training of the staff at the MO Tokyo. Example - we had booked a private guide for two half-days. This was a wonderful lady who spoke great english and took us to the places which were of our interests, and not only the ones in the guide books. After spending time with her she obviously learned about our interests in Japan and the history, culture , etc. After the second tour, on the day of our check-out, I received a small package from the concierge. I gift. I don't want to get into details here, but it was not a gift of high monetary value, but one of extreme kindness and consideration on part of the concierge team. After showing this small present to my wife, she practically started tearing-up in happiness. It was exactly what we have been wanting to bring back from Japan, and even better it was made for and about our family. In a situation like this, saying thank you seems too little, but is is all you can do. This was the so called ""icing on the cake"". After spending a week in Tokyo, we went on to Kyoto for few days. We stayed in a very nice hotel, the Hyatt Regency, and upgraded to a very nice room, but after staying at the MO you just become too pampered, and anything else is a bit of a let down. Upon returning to Tokyo before our flight, we spent one night at the MO and felt as if we were returning home. Of course, we were greeted with the welcome back, and how was your trip to Kyoto. Wonderful! If you have the time and means to spend at the MO in Tokyo, please do not hesitate. It goes well beyond five or six stars in our eyes. Of course it all comes with a price attached, but for similar money you can also get so-so service. So don't make that mistake and stay with the MO Tokyo, perhaps the best hotel in the world!","San Francisco, California","AmidaBuddha</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",30,5.0

The hotel sets the standard for luxury. It sits on the 32-38th floors of an office building in a commercial section of Tokyo, with floor to ceiling windows providing sweeping views of eastern and western Tokyo. The guestrooms facing the west-- Mandarin Deluxe -- cost more, and offer a view of Mt. Fuji -- which only can be seen during certain times of the year. During our stay, Mt. Fuji was shrouded in fog. It might be better to spring for the higher priced room in the wintertime, when the mountain is visible. Tokyo's eastern exposure is also breathtaking, but be prepared for early morning sunshine pouring in when you open the draperies.  The rooms are relatively large, and every detail has been arranged with a traveler's comfort in mind: For example, there is a closet adjacent to the door of the guest room where the morning paper, polished shoes or other service has been discretely placed, that the guest can access from inside the room without opening the front door. The elegant bathroom has a wall mirror that slides so that you can have an unobstructed view of Tokyo from the bathroom. Each shower provides three shower heads -- a downpouring overhead unit; a wall mount, and a handheld unit. The lighting is ample and strategically placed.There is a well-equipped exercise room with floor to ceiling windows overlooking east Tokyo, featuring a wide range of Life Fitness equipment connected by wireless headsets to cable; and complementary freshly squeezed juice is served, A box in the guest rooms contains a collection of broadband ethernet and video cords. Broadband access is complementary. The service staff are ubiquitous and very helpful. When we returned to the hotel a week later for our last evening in Japan, the staff greeted us by name.Because the hotel is only two years old, some taxi drivers are not familiar with its location. Be sure to get a card with the hotel address and map on it before you go out, to avoid problems returning to the hotel.Dining in the more casual restaurant (where breakfast is served) on the 38th floor was excellent and had a range of reasonably priced choices. The breakfast cold buffet featured wonderful pastries and fruit, as well as traditional Japanese offerings. A hot buffet is also available.While expensive, the Mandarin Oriental was by far the best city-based hotel that we stayed in. We would definitely book it again if we return to Tokyo, unless the rates become out of sight. We enjoyed an internet off-season rate.",Maryland,"Susan N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maryland</strong>",8,5.0

Walking towards the doors of the hotel, a porter rushed towards us and took our cases, while another member of staff greeted us. As we walked, he asked my surname, and without looking at any notes, confirmed my first name. I know it's a small thing, but it immediately makes you feel like they're making an effort. We were escorted to the lift, and up to the reception/lobby floor. The porter had obviously called up to reception when we went to the lifts, because when we arrived in the lobby, they had my paperwork waiting on the reception desk ready for my signature. They also presented me with some concert tickets I'd ordered ahead. Superb.We booked a Mandarin Deluxe room, which was vast. The corridors to the rooms are arranged in such a way that you feel you're actually in quite private wings of a smaller hotel. It's another small detail that adds to the comfort of your stay. The room was immaculate, and every item in it felt very high quality. Even the slippers were the best hotel slippers I've ever used, and the bathroom accessories (including a surprisingly good hair brush) were excellent. Items were replaced on a daily basis, so almost as soon as we unwrapped a brush from its little Mandarin Oriental bag, we'd find another one in the bathroom. Also in the bathroom, you would find an almost unbeatable walk-in shower, a huge, fast-filling bath and a top-end Toto toilet, complete with an ""extra deodorising"" button.Another notable feature in the room was the massive flat-screen television, and its extremely impressive array of entertainment options. These included internet radio, meaning we could ditch the dubbed international news channels, and listen to our favourite BBC 6Music shows. The bed was supremely comfortable, and the air-conditioning was quiet and effective. We weren't fortunate enough to see the top of Fuji during our stay, due to cloud, but you would have an uninterrupted view on a clearer day. The only criticism I would have of the room is the lack of drawers; there were none in which to store clothing. Perhaps they're not used to people staying for extended periods, but we had to improvise using the Kimono box and the top shelf of the wardrobe (not suitable for someone under 6ft tall, I'd suggest). Free wireless broadband access was very useful, though, and the in-room safe comfortably accommodated my 15"" laptop, cameras, documents, etc.The hotel isn't in the most convenient of locations, if you're in Tokyo for fun. It's about 25 minutes on the tube to the bright lights of Shibuya, 10-15 minutes to Ginza and Akihabara, and at least half an hour to Shinjuku. However, because it's on top of a tube station, most of these places are reached very easily. Shinjuku's a little awkward, as you have to change line a couple of times, or walk to a different station. But Shibuya and Ginza are directly accessible, and Akihabara isn't far from a direct station. We enjoyed being slightly out of the madder parts of Tokyo, knowing that it was easy to go in to the more exciting areas. It was a short walk over to the Imperial Palace and its peaceful grounds and nearby high-end shopping.The hotel bar was expensive but stylish, with a view over the city towards Fuji san. We ate in the restaurant on the lobby level once for dinner and every day for breakfast. Dinner was rather nice, but unspectacular. Breakfast was wonderful - everything you could want, and all sorts of eggs cooked to order. Also, room service was delicious and well presented.Staff at the hotel were unfailingly polite and helpful. We had a couple of problems with our automatic curtains/drapes, and the housekeeping manager was disproportionately but endearingly apologetic, and did his best to sort things out swiftly. It was hardly a problem...we just had to draw the curtains by hand for one night. The concierge was also very helpful.We stayed here for 6 nights, and loved every one. Tokyo is a fascinating city, with so much to do. And this has to be one of the world's finest hotels, within easy reach of some of the world's finest shopping and entertainment. If we go back to Tokyo, I don't think we'd consider staying anywhere else. We've stayed in quite a few good hotels around the world, but this one takes first prize.

We have stayed in many top hotels, and we just expected another 5-star hotel experience. As our cab approached the hotel driveway, the doormen were already enthusiastically waving to our cab, ushering it to stop where they were all eagerly waiting and with great efficiency, they unloaded the bags from the boot even before we paid the cab fare. We were greeted with warm welcomes and ushered to the 38th floor where the reception desk was. After a quick check in, we were shown to our room. Amex Centurion has a stay 2 nites, pay 1 nite promo at all MO hotels, valid for once a year and we took advantage of that. We were upgraded to the premier king room but decided to splurge on the executive suite for an extra 20,000 yen. It was very spacious, the bathroom had a free standing bath and a huge shower with seating for 2 people in it! The bed wasnt a full king, my only grouse for the price we were paying, we should have a full king bed. Broadband access is free, huge flat screen tvs, and very plush coverings. But the reason why i am writing this review is not because of the room, many good hotels have this too. Its the MO service that we are most impressed with. We have never experienced a level of service that ""goes the extra mile"" as we did here at MO. We were going to Izu, a 3 hour train ride out of Tokyo and altho I had done my research on the internet, we still had a few queries about getting there. The train schedule seemed to indicate that we needed to transfer trains but other sites said diff things. We checked with the front desk at MO and immed the man there, a very helpful Mr Takashi, offered to help me decipher and make out the route there. He took my train schedule and other info, made a copy and said he would get back to me. In less than 2 hours, they slid a note under our door and said that they would be happy to purchase the train tickets for us for the journey there and back to Tokyo. Of course we said yes please, and an hour later, the train tickets were sitting at the front desk waiting for me to pick them up. I only paid for them at check out. Someone actually went to the train station and bought the tickets for us, how cool is that!When we got back from Izu 3 days later, we were greeted with ""Welcome back Mr ---!"" by the doormen. How do they remember everyone's names?? I wouldnt flatter myself to think that they remember only our names of course, that they remember returning guests by name is amazing to me. Went to the spa and hub did a facial. They didnt just complete the facial and forget all abt him, they advised him on his skin type and how to manage his skin care. All in all, the service at the MO is stellar, and unmatched in all the hotels that we have stayed at, we have never felt so pampered and taken care of. We were not just guests, we were valued and treated with utmost respect and hospitality, they fully deserve their 6 star rating and what they lose out to in terms of location (how i wish they were in a shopping belt!), they more than make up for it in unparalleled service and warmth.

The design of the room is very stylish and comfortable with high quality materials and appliances. The room has a big Plasma TV and plenty of other fancy technology (i.e ipod and laptop connections). The bathrooms were also top notch, with a lovely big bath and separate shower and little flat screen TV. This is an expensive hotel but in comparison to other 5* hotels in Tokyo not that much more (sometimes even less) and well worth it. We did not choose a breakfast rate as it is in a city and coffee shops are close by. We had breakfast in several coffee shops (like Starbucks or similar), which were all in 5-10 min walking distance and always on the way to the place we wanted to visit that day.The location is also good. The subway access is in the hotel and you can get across town with the very efficient subway system. The hotel restaurants are also excellent. Again pricey but food and service were out of this world. There are plenty of restaurants in nearby Ginza. Just jump in a taxi, the staff at the hotel entrance help in explaining the drivers were you want to go and make sure you know how to get back to the hotel – very sweet.Another great benefit was that the Internet access was free.Overall I am just repeating what many people have said before me.

(For example, I wanted something that wasn't on the menu - they made it!).Very minor niggles...and yes, they are minor...were service in the 'all day dinning' restaurant was well meaning, but a touch all over the place.

It's quite simply one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The service was first class and the staff couldn't have been more courteous. We stayed on floor 38 and the view of Mt Fuji in the morning from our window was breathtaking. The hotel has lots of great restaurants and you must have cocktails in the lounge as the views over Toyko are uninterrupted.I loved the bed, it was huge and the most comfortable few nights sleep I've ever enjoyed. The rooms are furnished to a very high standard indeed.I also loved the spa facilities, they don't seem to advertise that they are free, but you'll get the best views ever and it's open quite late. I also enjoyed a signature treatment which was fab, though a little pricey.If you're like me and debating over the Hyatt or the Mandarin, I promise you won't be disappointed, it was perfect in every way.Oh and if you get the chance, hire a private guide circa £100 for two people (or if you're brave enough go it alone) and take yourself down to the fish market where you'll catch the fish auctions, it's incredible.

It was excellent in everyway. The room was large and the view was to die for---even at breakfast we could see the sun rise slowly over Tokyo. The location is not right in the midst of tourist town but it is conveniently close to everything due to a great subway/train system underneath the hotel. Ginza is only 2 stops away--about 5 minutes. However, it was the small touches or the attention to detail that made this hotel extremely memorable for us. The bathroom IS definitely the best room with tv, deep soaking bath, 3 types of shower heads and still the view! The service was wonderful---nothing was too much trouble and they even took us down to the station to showed us how to purchase tickets for the train. Not that daunting but it cut out a lot of possible confusion. I was also able to get the concierge to purchase JR train tickets to our ski resort before we arrived and charge it to our room. These tickets can not be purchased outside of Japan so the concierge saved me much precious time in that regard. All I can say is that the hotel staff were absolutely warm, efficient, and truly helpful in every possible way. Yes, it is expensive but worth it to experience the best---at least once! Oh yes, the breakfast buffet was excellent---very nice smoked salmon, eggs benedict with crab meat, and truly crisp luscious french pastries to enjoy.

We arrived very early (at 6 o’clock am) to Tokyo airport, so we were at the MO around 8:00 and they had our rooms ready. They knew in advanced, but they took care of that little detail. Check in was courteous, efficient and fast. They understood that after 15 hours of travelling we needed to rest. However if it had took a little more, it wouldn’t had bothered us, the lobby is beautiful. Being at floor 38 and having views to all Tokyo, is just fascinating. When we arrived to the rooms, the wow factor continued. Rooms are elegant, contemporary yet classy and rich of Japanese heritage. We reserved rooms looking toward the Imperial Garden and Mount Fuji, which are a little bit bigger than the rooms facing the other side. High technology is everywhere. The bathroom is impressive and the shower is the best. Breakfast was included with our rate, so we had it. It was fabulous. When we entered the restaurant (with views too), we saw a not-so-large selection. But soon we learnt that it was just half of it, the other part was “a la carte”. The selection in the menu was gourmet and the food surpassed the expectations. The only place I can think of having a breakfast as good is the Peninsula Hong Kong. When we left the hotel, it was before the restaurant was opened, so they gave us box-lunches, which were quite good.The facilities are not just the only great part of this hotel, it is the service. They are really happy that you have chosen their hotel. When returning to the hotel, we were greeted with “welcome back”, for example.

Elegant materials, warm woods, special touches, and sound proofing make you want to stay forever. And the bathrooms? Wow.....you can't beat the combo of Asian design and German engineering (the shower and lavatory plumbing are HansGrohe from Germany). The Japanese Toto toilet took some getting used to, but that heated seat was a real treat! Probably the most comfortable bed/pillow combo I've ever enjoyed in a hotel and the linens were as high end as I had expected.The staff were polite, attentive and unobtrusive.

This is simply put: the BEST hotel in the world. It's beyond 6 stars and they can do no wrong.We booked an S class limo service from the airport and from the moment we arrived at the hotel, they had staff and porters waiting for us. The staff to guest ratio is incredible and you always feel that someone is nearby to assist. They took us immediately to our rooms where check in staff were on hand with arrival documents. Our bags came quickly thereafter and we were free to enjoy the incredible views of Tokyo that this hotel offers. The hotel sits atop an office building and has 30th+ floor views of the mountains, the city (Ginza is down the road) and you can see parts of the Imperial Palace's park lands.The premier grand deluxe rooms were breathtaking. Extremely spacious by any standard and exceptionally luxurious. The details are what matter here: a hand written note card tells you the day's weather information and tomorrow's; everything automated and electronic (including blinds and curtains); HDTV flatscreen; iPod plug in point; yoga mats and umbrellas; walk in wardrobe area; separate spa bath and open style shower... You couldn't ask for a better appointed room. And like the earlier reviews mentioned, the little ""hand through"" closet at the door is a very well conceived idea for the room. They delivered messages and newspapers without ever having to knock.We also enjoyed the inclusive breakfast every morning. You can order eggs a la carte/any style and there was the great buffet. More fusion style than simply Japanese, and they had a nice selection of beverages. We also had one business lunch in the all day dining restaurant and the food and service was very good. The only complaint we had here was that the coffee service was a tad bit slow every morning. We also invited friends over to enjoy the views at the tea lounge near the Mandarin Bar. We had tea, drinks, and some Chinese appetizers and the staff were not only attentive and friendly, but the service is non-instrusive in a nice and discreet way.We also used the gym everyday. The treadmills have views over the entire city and the large flat screens with wireless headsets made running very enjoyable. The gym is well equipped and the fresh juices and fruit are a nice touch. The staff person there was always helpful and on hand to make your work out productive. On our first time, he recommended the spa on the 37th floor which was free of charge if you use the gym. We followed his advice and went down to use the spa pools and sauna/steam room. This had to be the best and most relaxing thing activity in all of Tokyo. The views from the spa pools are hard to beat!The other thing we noticed that was exceptional was the house keeping staff were always on top of everything and you never saw them. A house keeping trolley was never in sight! They always knew when we weren't there somehow and they would always make up the room and do the turn down service. The aromatherapy bowl in the turn down service was a very nice touch prior to bed time.Another example of how great the level service is: hotel staff bow everytime you walk by and wait for you to pass. They wait for lift/elevator doors to close before moving on. And above all else, they have the ""just say yes"" attitude which makes everything a joy.I would highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure (although Roppongi would be a better location for leisure travellers). The subway is just downstairs and very convenient and there is plenty to do at this location (the office building has a food court and shops). If you are debating which hotel to stay at in Tokyo, you will not only get the best in Tokyo here, but the best in the entire world.","San Francisco, California","ausbilly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",41,5.0

Little things, like the compartment in the closet where you leave things for pickup so the staff never need to bother you when picking up or leaving things for you, make this hotel a cut above most. The room is beautifully appointed, with high-quality laquer boxes for storing things like yakuta and slippers. The bathrooms are a delight - although if you want to use all the functions on the hi-tech toilet it may take you a while to figure it out. At the desk in the room there's a connection panel - with high quality cables - so you can run your iPod or portable DVD player, into the entertainment system, or even play something from your laptop. This makes it a very pleasant hotel if you're stuck doing business. Of course if you're like me you'll want to spend most of your time out of the hotel exploring Tokyo, and the location is great for that: Tokyo Station is 3 minutes walk, and there's a subway station just around the corner from the hotel entry. There's plenty of great eating in nearby Ginza, but going further afield is easy. The staff all speak flawless English and are great with directions.By the way, Maranouchi department store, just around the corner, sells some lovely porcelain.The hotel restaurants are also exceptionally good, if slightly westernised for my tastes (I prefer a traditional Japanese breakfast, but I'm odd like that).If money is no object, get the hotel limousine from Narita. If money is an object, get the shuttle bus that runs from Narita to the hotel by way of the downtown air terminal. Or get the train to Tokyo and a 500Y taxi ride from there (or walk - it's only a few minutes if you don't have much luggage).If you have the money to splurge, this is one splurge you won't regret.",Sydney,"rachel612</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",25,5.0

My only slight concern was that although the restaurants were lovely to look at (and the service was superb), the food was not on par with the surroundings.

No other place in the world will you get better service than at a five star hotel in Tokyo and this is clearly one of them. It cannot be described, it must be experienced but it will leave you spoiled. Go anywhere after this and it will be a dissapointment. Location:It is good for business as it is walking distance to Marunouchi. Hence also convenient for tokyo station and ginza. But otherwise not as exciting neighbourhood as the Grand Hyatt in Roppongi.Interior:Very nice and feels new. Good sized rooms, good bar and lounge. Negatives:Does not have the excitement and views of the American Bar & Grill on top of the Park Hyatt. Location is not very exciting for leisure, Grand Hyatt is better for that.

It would be an understatement to say that they were pleased.There was an artfully presented snack left for us in the room each afternoon which was quite unexpected and delightful.The location was extremely convenient. The subway stop is located within the building itself, and Ginza is about 20 mins away by foot. The service was incredible. Smooth, polite, efficient, competent and discreet without being overly solicitous.

The graciousness of the staff made us immediately feel warm and welcome. We had arrived from the train station and as soon as we walked through the door, our bags were whisked out of our hands while we were directed to the elevator up to the top floor where the lobby was. And what an absolutely stunning view of Tokyo the lobby has! We were escorted to our room and oriented on the amenities in the room. Everything - from the check-in to check-out process, helping us with transportation to the airport, etc.- was done efficiently and competently. Our hotel room was very spacious (by Tokyo standards) with breathtaking views of the city. It had a large picture window. Decor was understated and elegant. Had free internet access and wide variety of TV & music programming so it felt like home. The bathroom had a great shower with 3 different shower options. Also fantastic soaking tub with own wall-mounted TV. It was also the little touches in the room that were nice - a large assortment of Lupicia tea, scented oils for the room, a turndown service that included the next day's weather forecast, yukata robes, slippers, and bathrobes, large umbrella since it rained frequently while we were there...The only drawback is that the lounge & bar appears to be very popular... and extremely smoky. It was very crowded at night both nights we were there, and so any visions of us enjoying a relaxing drink gazing at the lights of Tokyo quickly dissipated as we were unable to find a seat anywhere. We did enjoy a nice glass of wine in the Tea room. As an aside, if you are into interior design, the decor in each of the dining areas are worth checking out. We felt that this stay was amazing... if we have the opportunity to travel with our kids to Tokyo again in the near future, we will likely stay here.

The room was great and the bathrooms particuarly nice - very deep baths and plenty of bathroom freebies that my wife covets so dearly.TV options were cool with lots of free HDTV documentaries and the movies were reasonably proiced at Y1500 - which is fair for a hotel of this nature.They charge Y6000 to use the sauna as well - which I thought was a a cheek - but they don't have a pool and the spa is probably one of the cities best ($280 USD facial anyone?).The bar was also great for propping yourself up at - although the all female bar staff and the particuarly annoying bar manager annoyed us. She refused to ley anyone sit in the waiting area for the French restaurant, even though we could plianly see waiters breaking the tables down (i.e. no one would have to wait to eat in a half empty restauarant, so this waiting area would never be used for it's intended purpose.) We also ate at the Molecular tapas bar - which was fun - but hard to recommend. A particular note was the concierge who recommended a brilliant cheap noodle house and the maps they give you to explore are a notch above the kind you normally get.Hard to fault apart from the grumpy and jobs-worthy bar staff....The staff ARE nice - but the Park Hyatt is in a different world when it comes to service.","London, United Kingdom","coops9999</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",309,5.0

The room was technologically tricked out (electronic shades, drapes, lights) with a great view of the city and bay area. The bathroom was amazing including a toilet with heated seat, auto flush etc.The large jacuzzi tub was nice and three types of bath salts were left each day. The room included a hot water server for tea on demand and three types of fantastic teas were provided. Bedding was luxurious and the matress was perfect. The room service was prompt but I found the food to be just slightly above average. My sister slept on a rollaway (as usual when she travels with us) and said it equaled the beds in the room which were fabulous. She said it rivaled the rollaway at the FourSeasons Beverly Hills. I think she should write a hotel travel guide for roll away beds. This hotel is located in a high rise that is above the subway system and that is great for getting around. We took one cab the whole time. Do not book your airport car through the hotel unless you are spending someone elses money. $350.00 USD. The shuttle bus takes about 15 extra minutes for $30.00 USD. There is a am/pm shop located on the underground floor of the building that has unique drinks and great quick japanese breakfast items like rice balls stuffed with salmon and eda mame.

The room was amazing overlooking the harbor and city, at night it was amazing. The location was great with lot's of places to visit nearby as well as the subway beneath the hotel. I do recommend getting a card from the front desk with the address of the place your staying because the cab drivers for the most part do not speak any english and need addresses for most places. You will be glad you stayed here. We have been wanting to go to Japan for about 7 years and every time we would tell a travel agent they discouraged it greatly. They kept telling us it was extremely expensive and hard to communicate. You could compare the pricing to London, Paris, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, or any other big city. I'll admit the signage was a bit intimidating so make sure you have maps and addresses. The people are very service oriented everywhere you go and in a world where service no longer matters it was extremely refreshing. For this alone it is high on the list of going somewhere to be pampered and appreciated for your business. I recommend setting up tours, the guides speak english very well.

It really is an amazing place that captures the essence of Japan but not doing it in a way that would make foreigners uncomfortable.What impressed me the most happened upon check-out. The duty manager introduced herself, and escorted me to taxi waiting downstairs. On the way she asked me sincerely if there was any way that my stay could have been improved and then apologized for a technical glitch that had happened two days earlier in the room. 1. I can't believe she found out about it - it was so minor. 2. i can't believe she remembered 2 days later.The rooms are a tech person's dream - all of the audio/visual is run by a receiver and a computer that are kept in a small compartment that's locked under the TV. As I was going through the TV channel guide, the windows blue screen of death popped up. I called the front desk, IT came within 3 minutes, and rebooted the computer.

I was fortunate enough to sample the legendary Park Hyatt Tokyo, the ever stylish Grand Hyatt Tokyo, and the best among all, the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo (MOTYO).LOCATION MOTYO is located at the heart of the pulsating Kanda commercial and financial district, an area adjacent to the Tokyo Station. MOTYO is the newest kid on the block, perched some 30 stories above the new 38 storey Nihonbashi Mitsui Tower, which is designed by one of the world foremost architects, Cesar Pelli, who is most notably responsible for creating Malaysia’s pride and joy, Petronas Twin Towers. Despite its close proximity to Tokyo Station, -about 5 minutes by cab-, Kanda has not been an area of choice for stay, as it has been in dormancy in the hotel scene for quite sometime, until MO finally arrived on December 2005. This probably explained the difficulty that I had to deal with the cab driver, who spoke no English at all, and knew nothing about the Mandarin, or if there existed any hotel in Kanda area. I instructed him “Mandarin Hoteru, Mitsukoshi-mae”, to explain its proximity to the local landmark Mitsukoshi department store, which is adjacent to MOTYO; and also subway stations that bears its name, -Mitsukoshi-mae-, both served by the Hanzomon & Ginza Lines. As the driver had little clue of the “hoteru”, I further hinted “Nihonbashi Mitsui Building”, of which he still yet to get the idea. It was only became handy to be an architect who has an extensive knowledge of buildings in major cities in the world, that I led him by pointing towards the MO building when we were very close to the area. It finally, however, brought me only to the kerb side of other office building, some 100 meters away from MO’s ground floor lobby. Imagine: a stranger leading the way to a taxi driver, it just didn’t make any sense. So remember these keywords: Nihonbashi (Japan’s first road), Mitsui Building, and Mitsukoshi. It’ll definitely get you near MO. Airport Limousine buses pass the hotel on the way to Narita Airport, but I was told that MO is the first hotel for the pick-up, and there will be few more other stops, so the journey will be quite long and delayed. The fastest way through public transport to the Airport will be taking a cab to Tokyo station; and catch the punctual Narita Express (NEX) that comes at an hourly interval. I did the impossible task of rushing late to take the 11am NEX train with only 30 minutes and was still in the room just about to check out. After much running, some traffic delay inside the taxi, coins dropping at ticket counter, and much running again at the station, I finally made it inside NEX and off my way to the Airport. SERVICEHands down the best in Tokyo: gracious, unobtrusive and first class. Everything is handled efficiently. Even my email correspondence inquiring of the many room types was handled accurately within 24 hour. Staff even apologized for my confusion of the room types!!.Likewise, when a ground staff saw me dragging my luggage after being dumped by the taxi driver on the kerb side, he quickly came to the rescue, helping me with the luggage and led me straight to the lift that took me to the sky lobby on Level 38. The receptionists were very friendly and spoke fluent English. Check-in was swift and while there don’t forget to ask for local maps and transport timetables. A female staff then proceeded to escort me personally to my Mandarin Corner Room and straight away helping me with the luggage. Being a gentleman, I insisted to carry it myself midway in the hallway, as the thought of a woman bringing my luggage is simply wrong. Inside the room, she explained the plethora of the room amenities and gadgetry, which I have become familiar now, having stayed recently at the Landmark MO in Hong Kong that has similar setting. She was very gracious and wanted to make sure my stay to be the most pleasant one. She turned out to be the Duty Manager!. Likewise, during my rush check-out time, I refused the offer of yet another female staff to take my luggage and stormed off to the lift. Within seconds, the Resident Manager ran and fetched me to offer help and joined me inside the lift until I finally got in my taxi. Staffs at the ground floor lobby bow whenever they saw me; I felt living like a king for one day.RoomsRooms arrangement are unique at MOTYO as all rooms are located beneath the sky lobby at level 37 -38; in comparison to the usual arrangement of, say, Grand Hyatt Shanghai, where the Sky Lobby is sandwiched midway between the office levels below and guest rooms above. Henceforth, whenever you want to leave the hotel from the room: you need to take a lift up to the Sky Lobby and then take a separate lift down to the Ground Floor Lobby. You will get use to it!.MOTYO has 5 room types, including the Deluxe, Premier Deluxe, Mandarin Deluxe, Mandarin Corner and Premier Grand. Each has a generous space of 50m2, the largest anywhere in Japan, and Premier Grand has an even larger area at 60m2. The best room would have to be the ones facing the Imperial Palace ground and Mount Fuji, which in this case only available at Mandarin Deluxe and Premier Grand only. Others simply face Sumida River; expansive view of low rise Tokyo to the East and Tokyo Bay to the South East. My 50m2 Mandarin Corner room has 270 degree breathtaking view of both Tokyo Bay and the river view from Level 36. What is unique with this room, and hence my persistent when booking it, is the wrap-around full height window on the corner bedroom and also the bathroom, resulting in a well-lit room during the day; and at night it is amazing to have a soak on the tub with the amazing Tokyo night scene. That said, the room is narrower than others, but longer with the addition of a central vestibule separating the bedroom/living area and the bathroom. It is beautifully decorated with soft hues in contemporary setting, fitted with a superlative High Definition 45 inch (yes, 45!) Panasonic Aquos directly fronting the bed with an impressive 50 channels, arranged as part of the stylish and user-friendly communication interface, which allows guests to check their bills, set a healing background music, select TV and radio channels, and also access to pay movies. There is even a DVD player with virtual surround sound system for convenience; and broadband internet was complimentary: what a luxury!. Both bedside console panels allows you to operate all electronic gadgetry in the room, including the dual-layer, electronically-operated curtains. Wardrobe is even stocked with yoga mats!Although I was slightly disappointed with the narrowness of the room, it is still supremely comfortable, and at night you can have all windows opened and the whole night scene of Tokyo is presented to you like a giant wallpaper background.The bathroom is luxuriously decorated with acres of quality marbles, beautiful frosted glass and expansive Tokyo view from the bath, which can be concealed by an electric timber shutter. Above the huge bathtub is another 20 inch LCD TV, which will then confuse you as to what to choose: the view or the movies?. Another unique feature exclusive only at MOTYO is a pass-through box adjacent to the entry foyer, which allows uninterrupted delivery and handling of laundry, shoeshine, newspaper and other requests, so say good bye to a knock on the door screaming “Room Service”.FACILITIESThere are many dining establishment inside the hotel, including a French, Cantonese, Italian and an all day dining restaurants. There are also the popular Mandarin Lounge in loft setting; Mandarin Bar and a tea corner off the Cantonese restaurant. On the ground floor, just outside the hotel foyer is the elegantly decorated Mandarin Cake Shop which stocks fine chocolates, scrumptious breads and cakes and many yummy treats, all elegantly packed for takeaway. Recreation facilities include spacious and well equipped gym and fitness center; and a luxury spa in an elegant and contemporary setting. A key feature to the spa will be the indoor swimming pool which has one side edgeless towards expansive Tokyo view. A visit to the spa will not be complete without a few minutes relaxing by the pool. Sadly, I did not pack any swimming trunk, and rest assured swimming in your undies will be quite a spectacle, especially in an establishment like this. So it’s a no no!.VERDICTMOTYO is spectacular, truly befitting of its tag as Japan’s most expensive, luxurious and exclusive hotel. Service was exemplary, which has been the hallmark of the Mandarin Oriental group. Accommodation is the most spacious anywhere in Japan and is supremely luxurious, yet comfortable. It is without doubt, the highlight of my hotel stay in Japan.

I had almost a 24-hour layover, so I wanted to experience a little of Tokyo. Also, none of the airport hotels looked too appealing. The Mandarin Oriental turned out to be an excellent alternative to a dreary airport hotels. One key point - - the staff all speak English which makes everything so much easier when you're exhausted and trying to check-in after a 14-hour flight!The hotel is absolutely beautiful, immaculate, and has every thoughtful ammenity you could imagine. I got a rate of 54000 Yen which equates to about $445.00US (tax and service included) on the hotel's website. The rate also included complimentary internet connection which most hotels charge for. This is an excellent deal compared to similar hotels in the US. It's difficult to get a room at the MO in NYC for less that $700 per night. My room had a western view which looks out over the Tokyo skyline. On a clear day, you can see Mount Fuji. The room was very large with a gorgeous marble bath with separate shower, w/c, and huge soaking tub. I had a king size bed that was very comfortable - - expecially liked the pillows as they were large and very fluffy.Breakfast was excellent with all the usual western breakfast items. The pastries were especially good. The restaurant is on the 38th floor with floor to ceiling windows. My table was right against the glass so the view during breakfast was excellent.The fitness room was great with state-of-the art equipment and cordless headphones provided so you can listen to music or watch TV during your workout- - limited English stations. The fitness center is also on the 38th floor and all of the equipment is set up facing the windows so you have a beautiful view to enjoy while you sweat!Arrival and checkout were flawless as was every interaction I had with staff. The service was flawless and everyone was so kind. In my opinion, this hotel is phenomenal - - highly recommended.GROUND TRANSPORT TIP: It's very easy to take the Narita Express from the airport to Tokyo station and then to get a cab to the hotel. When you buy your ticket at the airport after clearing customs - get a ROUND TRIP as this will save you time on your trip back. The ticket will have the date and time of your train on it as well as your seat. Seating is by Car, row and seat. I was in Car 1 seat 7A. Get the hotel staff to translate your ticket for you. For your trip back to Narita, be sure you know which terminal your airline flies out of at Narita. American has just switched operations to terminal 2. You must know this ahead of time as there are two stops at the airport. There is excellent sinage which will direct you to the Narita Express platform. When you get to the platform at Tokyo station, there will be signs on the floor on the edge of the platform that indicate where your car will stop. The hotel is just a short ride from the station. The train takes about 55 minutes each way. Caution: allow plenty of time for your return trip to the airport. My train was about 45 minutes late on the way back. I had built in an extra hour so I was fine. You can also take a bus, which they call a limousine, but if you get stuck in traffic your journey could be very long indeed. It is a little tricky negotiating Tokyo station even though everything is signed in English, too. If you contact the hotel, they may be able to forward a map of the station or a link on the internet that has a map. I had a paper document that the hotel e-mailed me with the name and address of the hotel in Japanese - - important. Your cab driver will need this.

It did not disappoint. On any measure this is an outstanding hotel: service is attentive and charming, without being cloying. All rooms are a good size, and extremely well-designed and appointed. Dining in all the restaurants (including the bar) was good value for the quality and presentation of the food – plus, breakfast is served in the west-facing restaurant from where, on clear days, the snow-clad cone of Mt Fuji is clearly visible. As one has come to expect of any MO hotel, all public areas are also very beautiful – reflecting both contemporary design and local Asian influences in details, material and fabrics. (A prominent Japanese fabric designer was involved in the design project). Finally, in what is essentially a low-rise city the MO towers above local buildings – providing every room with jaw-dropping views across this extraordinary metropolis. This is used to great effect when being taken to your room for the first time in the evening; as you’re lead in, the window blind slowly goes up revealing a million lights of Tokyo stretching as far as you can see. Throughout this hotel the details have been really thought about. For me, it’s these that turned a great stay into an unforgettable one. I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat.","London, United Kingdom","ADL_London</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",19,5.0

The lady on duty had spent us a confirmation letter to our room to confirm the reservation.

After we got our tickets from Odakyu and was about to board the train. We saw Masuda san the guy who served us in MO.My first thought was he was off duty and but he told us that he had make a trip down to locate us when he found our reservation no. for the train. He was very apologetic and was worried that we got lost in Shinjuku station. He even gave us 2 bottles of warm Ocha for our train trip!

There is so much going on in this part of town that one doesn't have time for jetlag! While some may prefer the new developments in Roppongi, there is still the seedy side of that area to contend with, and believe me, there is nothing down market about the MO's neighbourhood! The Tokyo megalopolis sprawls out beneath your feet, and the views are absolutely breathtaking from any angle. My room was westward facing, and the views on Fuji-san at sunrise were astoundingly beautiful. All rooms at MO are huge, by any standard.

I like the wooden floor in the room, which seems much cleaner then carpets: ) but be careful with the marble bathroom, it's quite slippery....the amenities from Aromatherapy Associates was very good, others were also filled up once it's used up! Fast internet connection was being able to be accessed once we plug in the lap-top--for free!we arrived in the airport at ard 2:15pm, despite we had to tk the train to the other side of the arrival terminal and the long queue at the custom, we were still able to catch the 3:15pm Airport Limo to the hotel, which was important because there is only 1 bus per hour, if we missed it, we could only tk the bus at 4:15pm. Although many has commented there is always traffic jam in Tokyo, but we were lucky to reach the hotel in just 1 hour, i guess it's because the hotel is located on the east side of the city, and MO Tokyo is the second stop after the bus gets off the highway, rather then going all the way to Shinjuku area which you hv to go all the way to the other side of the city. hotel staff was very friendly, when we asked for recommendation of where to buy cameras, they were very enthusiastic in looking for shops to recommend. On our last day when we checked out, we had asked the staff to help bringing our luggage to the lobby, then downstairs where we took the airport limo back again (this time, it's a much longer trip, since the bus was stopping in some other hotels in the area before going to the highway), the 2 staff who helped us with the luggage had accompanied us all the way to the bus, helping us to put the luggage on it, and they stand right next to the bus for 10 mins to see us off! besides, one of them got on again, just to deliver us a bag with 2 bottles of water insde! which was such a kind gesture!We didn't use any of the restaurants, so i'm not able to comment, but there are Starbucks, MacDonald's, and a local buger store(sorry, i forgot the name of it), and with Mitsukoshi dept food hall, it's very conveient when you wanna grab sth to eat.

There is only one word to describe this hotel - phenominal (actually, two words - the second would be 'expensive'!). We stayed in a corner room that had a view to the north and west. It was ok, but I think looking south one can see Tokyo Bay and Tokyo Tower. The rooms in the hotel are on the 30 something floors and the views are great from that height. Those afraid of heights should not stay here!One thing that is important to note is that the hotel is located in the ""Nihonbashi Mitsui Main"" building, NOT the ""Shinjuku Mitsui Building"". This is important, as they are located in completely different areas of Tokyo. Upon arriving in Tokyo we took the Narita Express train direct to Shinjuku station. This station is a zoo! After locating the Mitsui Building we realized that something didn't look right (it's just your average high rise office building). I called the hotel and the operator very patiently gave me subway instructions that were right on the money. A half hour later we were at the correct Mitsui building. For those considering using the subway, a point to note is that there is an entrance directly from the subway station (Mitsukoshimae station) into the building. It is located to the right of exit A7. Exit A7 is a bit of a walk (all underground) from the ""Hanzomon Line"" but is located directly over the ""Ginza Line"".As for the hotel, we can't find anything to find fault with - which is good, because at a nightly rate that would exceed most people's monthly car payment, a stay here is truly a luxury. Is it worth it? In our opinion, if you can afford it - yes! The room has features we've never encountered anywhere - A pass through compartment for newspapers, your laundry, etc. A live orchid in the room. A toilet that you have to see to believe. Curtains and blinds that operate electronically (you can pretend that you're in your own CEO's office!). A large screen LCD or plasma HDTV (not sure which it was), and a second TV located next to the soak tub (this TV is has an independant tuner, so one can view unique channels). An instant hot water machine is also in the room. The hotel provides thick terry cloth robes, Japanese style sleeping robes and cushy slippers.The bell man who helped us when we checked in greeted me by name when we left the hotel later in the evening. That was really impressive. We can't comment on any of the restaurants or room service, as we didn't use them. It's so much fun being at this hotel that some may find it hard to leave. The hotel is located not far from the Ginza area and about a mile east of the Imperial Palace. The concierge service was very helpful with suggestions and dining options in the neighborhood (don't feel guilty using them, as there is a 10% service charge added to the bill. This seems to be customary in Japan). The one thing that is a bit of a bummer is that the Mandarin Oriental chain does not have an affinity program. You can receive miles for your stay, but the airlines that participate are all Asian carriers. Considering the cost of the room, this may give an edge to a Starwood, Marriott or Hyatt property in a future stay for us.","Oceanside, California","OceansideGreg</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oceanside, California</strong>",22,5.0

The Mandarin Oriental has got to be Tokyo's current ""It"" hotel. The views and the luxurious offered to their guests are phenomenal.ROOMI reserved the Mandarin Corner room (on the 33rd floor) which is the only room in the non-suite category to offer city views from windows in the bathroom. The room itself was very spacious and luxuriously appointed. The 45 inch LCD TV/personal entertainment centre was huge and the A/V kit which allowed my iPod to be plugged in was a great luxury. Needless to say, the personal entertainment centre itself offered a vast selection of music and videos. The room had two huge windows (more like glass walls) which offered breathtaking views of Tokyo - With the blinds and curtains controlled by controls near the bed. The bed was very comfortable and the bed sheets were the finest Egyptian cotton.BATHROOMOne word: Ultra-luxurious! The marble bath, the separate rain shower cubicle, the Aromatherapy Associates amenities, a bathtub LCD TV, separate washroom, all with beautiful views of Tokyo. One small glitch was the glass door to the shower: Make sure you don't hit it whilst in the shower because it easily opens and lets the water out.HOTEL FACILITIES/RESTAURANTSThe hotel offered a fitness centre/Spa (but no pool), but we didn't use these facilities. We did however dine at the Tapas Molecular Bar. The usual 2 hour dinner course was part entertainment, part food ""science"" but thoroughly enjoyable. Don't be put off by the small portions, as there are about 25 courses to this meal. Also, don't forget to make advanced reservations as only 6 people can watch/dine at this bar. Afterwards we enjoyed a nice Cuban cigar and champagne at the Oriental Lounge while enjoying the views of the Tokyo night sky.SERVICEThe service was VERY good, but again with some minor glitches. I made all my reservations via the Internet, and the people with whom I had correspondence with did mess things up a bit. I first made a reservation for the Tapas Molecular Bar at 6:00 PM, but changed it to 8:00 PM and received a confirmation e-mail. But on the day of our stay, I was told that my reservation was for 6:00 PM. I suspect this was due to the level of English proficiency of the person with whom I corresponded. It was obvious that they weren't proficient in English since there were numerous spelling/grammar mistakes in their e-mails. These slips while unacceptable by some (i.e. How hard is it to run the spell-check option in one's e-mail program?), they can lead to obvious reservation errors as it happened in my case.SURROUNDINGSThe hotel itself is a business district which is historic, but offers little in terms of entertainment. Your best bet is to explore the area.The hotel is about 15 minutes to Tokyo station and 30 minutes to Ginza on foot. Alternatively, you can use the subway which is easily accessed from the ground floor of the Mitsui Building (which the hotel occupies).CONCLUSIONWONDERFUL! The Mandarin Oriental Hotel is a bit pricey and the service can be spotty, but you do feel like (minor) royalty while staying here.","Tokyo, Japan","MRIII</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",135,5.0

Actually my first experience with this hotel was about a week before I stayed there. I was in the area and stopped by to have a quick look. One of the staff saw me looking around the lobby and asked if they could. After I explained I already had a reservation and this would be making my first stay with them they offered to show me a room like I had reserved. They also confirmed my expected arrival time for the reservation I was holding and after explaining I would be arriving a little early (12 noon) they said they would do their best to have my room ready. When I did check in the next week at around 12 my room was already ready (despite standard checkin time being 3pm). The staff were also able to recommend a very nice local sushi bar nearby and the location above the Mistsukoshi-mae subway station is very covenient. The room, a Mandarin Grand King, was relatively large with floor to ceiling windows (view out to the right of the Imperial Palace and the Bay Bridge over to the left). A large bath area with separate shower. The TV is a big flat panel display and you have lots of connections for internet or even for using the TV speakers for playing music from your pc. I have stayed at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo before and that was my favorite, however I really like the MO now and its convenient location. Also for my upcoming stay even though the internet site showed no rooms bieng available, I contacted the hotel directly by email and they were able to confirm a room for me immediately.

Hotel is right beneath Mitsukoshimae station along the Ginza line. Nice location, next to Mitsukoshi department store, and walking distance to Takashimaya at Nihonbashi. If you are arriving by train from Narita, it is also possible to walk from Tokyo station - about 15 minutes if you know your way.","London, United Kingdom","WaiKeong</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",15,5.0

It's a marvelous place. The views are just amazing, the rooms are spacious and the service is great. The location is ok; the hotel is about a 15 minute stroll from Ginza, and right above a metro station. The only problem we encountered was that cab drivers didn't know how to find the place (but of course that's a pretty common problem in Tokyo).","Portland, OR, USA","jpdx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, OR, USA</strong>",23,5.0

The minute you pull up you are treated like a queen and king! You are immediately escorted to the check in floor by their wonderful staff. Everyone here greets you with a bow and smile and will even run ahead of you to open your door! The rooms are great...big, very zen, and peaceful. I really enjoyed a nice bath in their big oversized tubs! They even have a tv in the bathroom and lavendar sea salts for your bath. Room service was also a joy..they wheel in a table completely set up even with a nice floral arrangement. We were celebrating an anniversary and they even sent up a bottle of champagne and chocolates!We got free breakfast which i didn't know was included..it was very healthy and delicious! Don't be surprised when you walk into one of their restaurants they know you by name...I was shocked by this!The spa is a real treat! To enjoy one of their fabulous suites you must book a two hour treatment which kind of sucked but trust the views were worth the money!Overall, our stay at the hotel was fabulous...we love staying at MO hotels...they are always so impressive!","San Diego, California","Dtravelgal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",105,5.0

The view from our room was spectacular. The room was modern, clean and very comfortable. The service varies a bit. As a new hotel, there are still somethings to be sorted out. We booked our room with American Express FHR program but despite asking for it, we did not get a room upgrade; the hotel was not full. We will go back even just for the view and its location.","Bethesda, Maryland","BlackLabNickie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bethesda, Maryland</strong>",71,5.0

The place is fantastic: rooms are large and very comfortable. The views are great since all rooms are on high floors. You get the typical 'Mandarin Oriental' Service - nothing is difficult and all your questions and problems are dealt with promptly and very professionally. If you want to have lunch in one of their restaurants you would need to book because the set lunches are very popular and excellent value. All restaurants are very good quality - but stay away from the Italian restaurant Ventaglia which is located on the second floor of the Mitsui tower. It advertises itself offering north italian cuisine. It was a disappointing choice of mainly fish dishes. The size of the dishes was a joke. It was one spoon of pasta for a main course. Not really north italian style at all. Bad value and mediocre cuisine!. However, the Spa is a a real treat. You can relax on water loungers and look over Tokyo's skyline. Treatments are first class and will be adjusted to your personal requirements. The only thing which was not too great was that check in is at 3pm. We arrived around 12:00 noon after travelling through Japan and had to wait until 3:00 to chekc in. It was not such a big deal - but we even could not get a table for lunch which was disappointing. I can recommend the hotel and the location is excellent. THere is a metro station in the basement of the building. I would always go back.",UK,"Wander11677</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>UK</strong>",12,5.0
