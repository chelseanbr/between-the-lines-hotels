Cleanliness and Service is second to none.Loved being so close to a less crowded beach and also walking distance to main shopping precinct. The staff went out of their way to accomodate us especially with early check in as we had a long flight.

What a treat this was .sandwiched between the Halekalani and Sheraton ,it provided us with a quite hotel, and easy access to the beach .Hotel beds are so comfortable and bathrooms well laid out with sensational heated self flushing toilets .Open areas on the 8 th floors were great ,with the both areas giving nice partial views of the beach .Staff there were top notch. Breakfast was OK , geared more towards the Japanese tourists , however we still got bacon eggs and pancakes.no cereals, jam etc.Having said that , the pastries at this hotel are unbelievably fantastic . BEST danishes ever( including what i had in France ).Worth a visit to their bakery outlet attached to the hotel . ",,393christobelc,0,5.0

Let me start by saying that I am normally paralyzed with options and I usually give myself a headache from too many reviews. If you are anything like me, I’ll make your life really easy- just book this hotel! You will not regret it. LOCATION: It is located right behind Sheraton and the sister hotel Halekulani. There is an easy beach access right across the street. There are a ton of restaurants and food options within walking distance. Trolley station is also across the street, a less than 5 minute walk. We only needed a car rental for two out of our 5 day stay and rented from hertz on Lewers street around the block. Highly recommend going to north shore and Haleiwa town to get a feel for real Hawaii, as Waikiki can be very touristy. I also think that the side of Waikiki that Halepuna is on is far superior than the opposite side; it was cleaner, restaurants were better, etc. i only say that because were initially booked at the Hyatt, and after passing it by I’m SO HAPPY we switched . We had a city view room which faced the pool and the Sheraton, and also gave us a glimpse of the ocean. Idk why people get so bent outta shape i read reviews about the construction in the street but let’s be honest if you are gonna stay in a busy area like Waikiki don’t expect to hear crickets at night. If that’s the experience you want you should book a little shack in the north shore.FOOD: our family, especially my husband, loves breakfast. This buffet, which was included in our hotel package did not disappoint! Omelet station, pancake and waffle ( and mochi waffles) and a full spread of options were impeccable! Fresh pastries, fruit , and rice a miso soup were just a few of the options. There were Japanese and European influences, and you can tell the food is very high quality. If you happen to order from the pool menu the burger with the taro bun is huge and really tasty.STAFF/AMENITIES: okay . TOTO toilets are the standard in this hotel. And if you haven’t had the glorious experience of sitting in this luxurious throne, you aren’t living your best life. The rooms have high quality bedding. We had a city view room but our lanai which was really tiny still gave us a view of the ocean! The ocean view rooms are definitely beautiful too. The hotel provides an insulated beach bag, with towels and water for your daily excursions. The room has a small fridge, electric water kettle and keurig coffee maker. There is even a self laundry area , so bring travel sized detergent if you plan to use it. The pool is awesome it is warmed to 85 degrees and the infinity pool is so gorgeous, providing a beautiful view of Waikiki beach. It’s not your typical resort pool- it was not crowded...and like the entire hotel, it is immaculate. They even provided sunscreen! The staff on the premises were so attentive and friendly. Keaton and Karine went above and beyond and made us feel like family . There is even a managers welcome reception on fridays where they serve complimentary tapas and drinks! This hotel experience has truly changed the way we travel. We wouldn’t hesitate to come back again!!",,j-chenrn,1,5.0

Lobby and staff are the hilites. My first room had items left behind by the previous guest. Moved to another room and same issue. Then while resting three young girls entered my room having been assigned the same room (key and everything). Potential safety issue. The rooms are very similar to a Hilton garden inn and the pool area the same. The staff in the restaurant and bakery are so accommodating and friendly. ,"Portland, Oregon","BH927</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",1,2.0

It’s located a few feet from the ocean and right next to Sheraton and the sister property Halekulani. The check in process didn’t start off right but the manager stepped in and we were upgraded to a Mountain View. The rooms are modern, they recently renovated the property. The view was awesome. The room was clean, bed very comfortable. Complimentary bottled water and Keurig in room. Fridge in the room was a plus. Housekeeping checked on us every night to replenish water, empty trash or pick up dirty linen. The shower and the Toto toilet were fabulous.( I might just get me one of those toilets)The breakfast buffet was delicious, many choices to choose from and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Food was seasoned well and the omelettes were so good!!!!We had a late night flight and they extended our check out time and also gave us access to the room on the 8th floor to freshen up and relax. WOW!!!!Overall I enjoyed my stay and highly recommend it. The manager was very friendly and attentive to our needs.Location is a plus.

The bad: its affiliation with Halekulani is a little misleading; its across the street but i dont think you have access to anything at the main resort. And there are two entrances, each located in the underbelly of the Sheraton hotel and garage. I couldnt believe how trashy those streets are despite being so close to the ocean.But once youre inside, wow. Just a wonderful property. I was ""upgraded"" to a ""mountain view"" room which was nonsense- every room either faces the city/mountains, or the beach, so its hard to understand what I was upgraded from? But man the room was BEAUTIFUL with brand new electronic blinds, lighting, terraces, bedding, etc. The pool is small and not great for swimming (shallow) but beautiful infinity effect towards the ocean. Loved (pricey) breakfast downstairs too. There are surf lessons and restaurants nearby. Solid location in between all the bigger resorts.This is not a resort- its a block back from the beach and isnt built to accommodate hanging out on site for days. But as a base to explore Honolulu its perfect: quick access to the beach and one block away from the main drag. Absolutely thrilled I got to spend a few days here.","New York City, New York","nb424</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",63,5.0

The decor and ambiance is exceptional. The service at check-in was quick and seamless and after almost 18 hours of travelling, very helpful. Although we did not have a direct ocean view room, from our balcony, you could see the ocean.The hotel is new and very modern in its amenities.The infinity pool is sublime and the highlight of my daughter's time there. The greatest praise however goes out to the staff. All the staff we interacted with throughout our vacation were friendly, smiling and willing to help you with anything you needed, especially the breakfast team. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to write down all the names, but Karene, Keaton, Peter etc. worked hard to make sure we were happy every morning.

Maki at infinity pool is amazing - running to get everything setup. Room was beautiful with little touches that make stay comfortable. Enjoyed daily activities - yoga and stretches. They have a beach bag ready with towels and water. They hosted a Valentine special wine and fruit reception in the garden and it was gorgeous.

We initially booked a 3 night stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village (big mistake) but we very quickly realized this zoo of a resort was NOT what we were looking for. After checking in at 6pm we were out of there by 6am the next day and quickly booked 2 nights at Halepuna and good lord was it the best decision we made! From the moment we arrived and were greeted by Miles (nicest guy ever) at the valet we knew we were exactly where we needed to be. It truly is ""Zen in the zoo of Waikiki"" as another reviewer stated. Wonderful staff, great location, convenient in room amenities. I can't say enough about this great hotel!

It was an oasis of peace, good service, and tranquility in the middle of the tourist chaos that is Waikiki. Each aspect of the hotel was maintained to a high standard. In fact, I walked by a manager who was saying to the staff with him, ""I'm just observing..."" and he sure was. From the top to bottom, I found the staff to be engaged and dedicated to offering service that was as beautiful as their renovated hotel. Loved my room... the bathroom, soaking tub, Nespresso machine, kettle, fridge, comfy bed plus A/C that was quiet and worked well—I like a cold room. Plus I never once heard my neighbours or sirens or shouting from the noisy streets or anything else that disturbed my sleep. The only suggestion I have is to get better quality shampoo and soaps with larger writing for those of us who don't take our glasses into the shower or bath. Hard to tell what's shampoo and what's body wash. A special thanks to Milla who cleaned my room daily. She's a truly dedicated employee with a big, big smile doing a tough job. I wouldn't hesitate to come here again. I hope to do it annually.","Seattle, Washington","macm69</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",14,5.0

Amazing fresh pastries baked on site daily.We had dinner in the restaurant one evening and the food was very good, with a focus on locally sourced produce.The hotel was very tranquil with barely any noise at night which is rare for the busy Waikiki area.

Keiko who checked us seemed frazzled, she repeated the same questions twice, didn’t listen to our responses at times and overall, didn’t give us much confidence or make us feel welcome in any way. As we checked in around lunchtime, she promised to call us when the room was ready, no call. We had lunch at the restaurant and wanted to sign it to the room but it wasn’t activated yet despite checking in so our helpful waiter went off to the front desk to sort it out. The ocean-view room was compact, clean and bright and yes definitely had an ocean view but a third of the view was obstructed by the towering Sheraton property next door. The property is sandwiched between a car park and a dead end where the garbage trucks/delivery trucks come and go all day long. The bed was comfortable but the foam pillows are hard. We wanted to go to a House without a Key next door at the Halekulani and called down to the front desk and spoke to Dennis for a reservation. We were told for a table of 2 that reservations weren’t necessary, just show up but that he would call them as a courtesy. Got to the restaurant with a huge queue for tables and was a bit disappointed that no reservation or call was made. Thankfully, the staff there were amazing and eventually found us a table for dinner. Overall, the hotel seemed sterile, no atmosphere and no vibe (no room service either), its well located and the bakery is great (the staff were really sweet there) but I won’t be coming back at this price point. I’ve stayed at many lovely hotels around the world and this was definitely not one of them.",,Milihkg,3,3.0

We’ve been previous guests of the former Parc Hotel. Halepuna is the newly renovated replacement. Although it’s a sister hotel by Halekulani, Halepuna can definitely stand-up by itself.The lobby is truly sets the stage for your wonderful stay. It’s spacious, upscale and inviting. It sets you in vacation mode and warmly hugs you in the hospitality of Hawaii.It’s nice to see the same friendly staff. Out of all the hotels we’ve stayed at through the years, Halepuna’s staff is the best. They are always there to help you, and say hello as if you are a family member. It feels so personable.When you first walk into your room, you are greeted with a spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean. The automatic window shades (sheer and blackout shades) are a great touch. Whoever designed the room layout and look did a fantastic job. Spacious and upscale. The amenities in the room are a nice touch...Kreurig coffee maker, Refrigerator, smart Tv, usb chargers, shaving kit, room lighting remote, slippers and robes. They thought of everything. Oh...the Infinity Pool. There are no words to describe how beautiful and breathtaking it is. And it’s huge! You can get your exercise and laps in like Michael Phelps.And the gym...what? Probably the best hotel gym I’ve ever worked out in. It very spacious and the equipment is great and practical. It even has a video wall if you want a workout that makes you sweat. You can pump those muscles up, do cardio and get your HIIT workout in. Love the disposable headphones, bottled water and coconut infused water dispenser. No Resort fee folks!Want to hit the beach? They lend you a nicely packaged beach bag with towels and bottled water.If you want a new, fresh, friendly, excellently-located hotel, this is your place.","San Diego, California","DrWasabi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",29,5.0

The Halepuna had a peaceful, upscale boutique vibe and reminded us of the Alohilani in Waikiki but with some even nicer touches and NO resort fee!We stayed in a Waikiki view room with a king-sized bed and were impressed with the serene feel of the room and upscale amenities. I loved the ombre blue wallpaper accent wall behind our bed, the two chairs at the small desk by the window, the automatic sheer and blackout curtain blinds, all the outlets and USB plugs available, and the bluetooth connection on the in-room phone.When we checked in to our room, there was a printed note with four tasty Halekulani Bakery mac nut chocolates on our TV console. Bottled water was replenished twice during our weekend stay.The room had a hot water kettle, ice bucket, Keurig and small refrigerator along with K-cups and tea bags. Ice available on the eighth floor. Complimentary slippers were in our closet along with terry cloth bathrobes for use during your stay.The bathroom has a Toto toilet, marble floor/walls/counters, a scale, hair dryer, Spa Halekulani toiletries and some small sewing, dental, shaving and toiletry kits. A big plus for me was that there was a tub big enough to soak in, which has been really hard to find on a search for most boutique hotels in Waikiki. Also, if you have little kids, you know that a hotel bathroom with only a walk-in shower often doesn't cut it.One downside for us: the bed was too firm for both my husband and I (and he generally prefers a more firm mattress). It could use a pillowtop mattress pad as I woke up a stiff both mornings. I would have also liked a sheet underneath the duvet for when the sheet-covered duvet got too hot.The hotel also provides twice-daily housekeeping. The evening service remade our bed and refreshed the towels and water again (though the attendant also took one dirty bathrobe along with the one unused, clean and still hanging robe in our closet and didn't replace them).Friday night there was a manager's reception in the eighth-floor garden area with wine and light appetizers. A really nice touch along with the glass sculpture art on the walls. It'll be interesting to see how the garden is used. There's a large stretch of astroturf that I'm sure would be good for yoga classes and had a few boho lounge rockers on it when we saw it. But otherwise I'm not sure what it would be used for except small receptions.The pool deck is wonderful. A mid-depth infinity lap pool and a good-sized jacuzzi are surrounded by lounge chairs. Small bed cabanas for two line the edges. Thought they had a unique range of light dishes and snacks on the pool menu, and we had two yummy cocktails while there. Infused water dispensers might be a nice touch and save the pool attendants from having to refill glasses as much. But there was a water bottle refill station, which is great. They also had a reef-friendly sunscreen dispenser at the towel station.We had coffee and pastries at the hotel's bakery side one morning. There were so many delicious-looking breads, pastries and desserts available. We didn't get to try the restaurant during our stay but it looked fairly busy in the morning with its buffet. I think there is supposed to be 24-hour room service eventually. But no room service seemed to have been available when we stayed as there was no menu on our TV hotel information page or in the room.Front desk staff were all extra friendly. Pool attendants also accommodating.I hope the hotel will continue offering a substantial kamaaina discount, which when we stayed in November included free self-parking. Again, the lack of a daily resort fee was amazing and rare in Waikiki.I thought this was an amazing value for the level of service and quality of hotel. Hope to stay here again.","Kailua, Hawaii","Annawl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kailua, Hawaii</strong>",10,5.0
