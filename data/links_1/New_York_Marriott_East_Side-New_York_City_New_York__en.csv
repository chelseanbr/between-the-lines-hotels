The description on Marriott’s site is deceptive, I believe intentionally, to hide that fact. If you would like a soda - and can cram yourself into a crowded closet they call a gift shop, have fun opening the cooler without knocking other “trinkets” they have for sale on the floor. Unlike most Marriotts, they don’t have many Pepsi products - no Mountain Dew. The M club is a bunch of rude employees walking around not being helpful. If you want a soda you’re out of luck - they don’t stock them. I won’t be back. I also wonder if Marriott knows how unappealing this property really is - because it shouldn’t carry the Franchise name.

I thought I would treat my family to a ""tourist"" day/night and spend some time in the City. We had a wonderful dinner and went to the Philharmonic. Then we went to the hotel. I am a lifetime Titanium Marriott member, meaning that I've staying more than a thousand nights and accumulated more than 2 million points with Marriott. Any my numbers are much higher. I say this just so it's clear that, usually, when I register, I'm treated, well, like a lifetime Titanium member. Not this time. When I approached the Rewards Members desk, I was told to go to the regular desk, despite no other customer being at the Rewards desk. I was affirmatively taken to the other desk. She was not interested in whether I was a Marriott member. All she wanted was ID. My Marriott ID wasn't good, and she was quite rude about it. So when I gave her my license, she studied it for what my wife thought was a full minute. Satisfied I was who I said I was, she checked us in without speaking to me or even looking at us. After handing me the keys (and almost forgetting to return my credit card and license), we went to our room. There are more than 30 floors in this hotel. Our room was on 11, which is important only because my Marriott status always -- always -- upgrades us to the high floors. When we got to our room, it looked like it had last been cleaned in the late '70s. And it was the size of a large shoe box. I went downstairs and, this time, went to the Rewards desk. The man behind the desk informed me that my room was in fact an upgraded room. In disbelief, I asked what their regular rooms looked like and if those rooms actually had bathrooms, because anything smaller could not fit one. He repeated that I had been upgraded and was done speaking with me. When I asked a final time, he said to step aside, although there were no other customers on the line. Please keep in mind that Marriott classifies this hotel as a resort, so there is a $25 resort fee added to the bill. Anyway, the room was gloomy. The noise from outside was so bad that we were able to get to sleep only by passing out. There was no food in the concierge lounge. They were even out of water. The messages and wake up call buttons did not work (though the front desk finally handled the wake up call request). The room also smelled. Finally, the two beds are doubles, not queens (if that makes a difference). Anyway, the breakfast in the lounge was standard scrambled eggs and bacon and some yogurt and fruit. Fine. When we checked out, though, unfortunately we had to deal with the front staff. Apparently, as a ""resort,"" you are entitled to a $25 food/beverage credit, $20 in dry cleaning and one Local NYC Experience. That ""experience"" is one of four things, including a bus ride, a ticket (per room) to Ripley's Believe It or Not or a ticket (per room) to Madame Tussaud's, We found this out by reading the back of our key. After returning the room key, I asked about the tickets to Madame Tussaud's and was told to pick them up at the Concierge desk. But when I went to pick them up, I was told that, despite being good for 30 days, their ""protocols"" prevented them from giving the ticket on the day of the checkout. But then, it was time to leave this tired, run down place. I couldn't leave fast enough. Since the mega merger a year ago, Marriott has plunged in my opinion and doesn't seem to honor its loyal customers. Ironically, after we left the hotel, we passed the DoubleTree a block away. Hilton is looking good now.","New York City, New York","Forfeitboy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",38,1.0

Great eating options nearby. The hotel itself is approach the time when it needs a re-fit. The building itself is historic (I believe Georgia O'Keefe once called the 32nd floor home)--but that doesn't mean that the hotel and its furnishings should be. My desk had seen better days, as had the furniture in the room generally. TV was large, but my window was quite small. In fact, I think the TV is larger than the window.Despite being a lifetime Titanium BonVoy guy, my ""upgraded"" room was just large enough for a king bed and a desk. My AC was efficient, pumping out a consistent 68 degrees F all night, but it made an extremely noisy clunking while doing so. The bathroom is tight. While you'd do so anyway, you need to close the bathroom door to use the toilet or bathtub/shower. The is very little counter space. The king bed had a very discernible ridge right down the middle between the two foundations. Lest this review sound too negative, my experience with the staff was excellent, as was my experience in the M Club with its ever-helpful hosts. Again, not intending to sound negative, but generally I'm not particularly fond of the M-Club movement among Marriott hotels such as this one, which essentially creates a Residence Inn-type dining hall experience--but exclusive to certain guests.The gym is on the 35th floor, and requires an elevator transfer on 32. If you're working out during the busy morning or evening hours, get your pre-workout workout on the stairs up to the 35th floor rather than wait 10 minutes or more for the next elevator car.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","offthewalls</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",85,3.0

Nothing. It’s also very small. Just bare bones. The hotel staff were polite and competent. The elevators worked well and were quick, which is a huge plus as we’ve stayed in other hotels in NYC with extremely slow elevators.

The agency had booked a stay at the Marriott East Side Hotel and I considered as a good choice since it belongs to a well-known chain.

Upon arrival we were told they had no availability but mostly surprised me the lack of any intention to try to find something. Well, the room (although with worn out carpet and wall-paper and patches on the ceiling) was relatively Ok, with comfort bed-mattresses and good coffee in the room. We stayed on the 8th floor and soundproof has been proved problematic as it is quite annoying to hear night and day the fire, patrol and ambulance sirens one of the very characteristic of this city.The hotel has the originality of not having a lobby!!! There is just a cafeteria on the ground floor that is managed by a private individual, so you are obliged to order if you wish to sit there.

When checking in, they said they would text me when ready. Never got the text. Upon checkin, requested a fan, then requested again at the front desk. We got into the room at 9:00 pm, asked for a fan again. When we got into the room, it was horrible. Dirty, small, and needed renovation 20 years ago. Not what I remember and not up to my standards. I called to the front desk and spoke to the manager, explained that the room was not acceptable and that I would not be staying, and not to charge me as the room was not used. She said not a problem, I immediately turned in my keys and found another place to stay. Adding insult to injury, I received an email folio showing that my cc was charged for a night. Horrible!

I am a Platinum member and stayed at this hotel 5 times. I guess I have been lucky enough to get rooms on the 16th Floor in the past, which are more modern. I used my Platinum Card anniversary certificate for a 50,000 point free stay over Thanksgiving weekend. Upon first impression, the lobby is not welcoming nor festive. There is not a single place to sit and a pathetic Christmas tree that is super small. They had a pipe burst a few weeks ago and they said this is the best they can do. My Christmas decorations at home are way better. It was a sad state in the lobby. It seemed like no one cared to put the effort into decor. Check-in was a circus of misinformed and unprofessional staff. No one ever explained the destination fee and what was included, nor was I offered my welcome points or gift/snack from the gift shop. Luckily, I knew about these benefits from previous stays.The elevators are slow and scary and in dire need of updates. We were given the worst room possible (Rm 2203). It was small, cramped and had a view of an airconditioning unit. The color scheme looked like Ronald McDonald threw up in our room. There were black marks on the pillowcases and the comforter had a big wad of dust and hair attached to the side. Beds were super small and soft. The room was not dusted thoroughly and the bathroom was old and moldy. The gross shower curtain didn't help matters. Tub only. No walk-in shower. Terrible water pressure. I felt like I was on an island. TV was on a weird angle and difficult to watch without straining your neck. Every single ice machine was broken during our stay. We tried all the floors. My husband called down to the desk twice and spoke to the front desk in person for the third try. The issue was never resolved during our stay.The bell staff did not pick up our luggage on a timely basis and we ended up taking it down ourselves. Getting our car took longer than usual and the laziness of the front desk to get our car ticket stamped was the icing on the cake. We paid and the front desk attendant told my husband he had to get in line at the bell stand to tell them that we needed our car. The bell stand is 2 feet away from the front desk. Why couldn't she tell him? He was standing right there!All in all, I would never stay at this hotel again. I travel to NYC frequently and will find a new hotel for my stay in January. I felt very undervalued as a Platinum Member (since 1997) and feel like I wasted my certificate on a dump. A very disappointing stay. I do not recommend this hotel at all. I stayed at the Marriott Downtown in October and they have a brand new hotel, excellent customer service, stunning views and we felt like valued Platinum Members. The GM left us a bottle of wine and note at check-in, which was a nice touch.

After our most recent trip, I think it's time to try something different. The rooms are good size, and as an elite rewards member the concierge lounge breakfast is a plus. However, the price difference between this hotel and others just didn't seem worth it on this trip. The breakfast offerings are minimal (bagels, toast, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes) and the food was about what you would expect of a free hotel breakfast. I will say that the lounge staff was amazing, very friendly and accommodating.The room size is decent, especially for NYC. We always stay in a King room, which I believe is around 350 sq. foot. The rooms are dated, but still in good condition. If you look closely, you can see the age in the bathrooms as they are continuously exposed to moisture, but our room across from the elevator on the 21st floor was quiet and comfortable. Accessing our Netflix subscription on the TV was a nice added benefit.One of the things that bothered me is as a rewards member, I put in my requests, foam pillows and extra towels. Those are never in the room when I check in, which is fine. I called down to the desk and housekeeping brought them right up. Here lies the problem. We showered, left the remaining extra clean towels on the shelf. The next day, housekeeping came in and cleaned, and they took our extra CLEAN towels. What gives?As an elite rewards member, we should be eligible for a free room upgrade as well as early check-in. We were notified through the app that our room was ready early (even though I asked for a phone call), however we have never received a room upgrade at this hotel.The location of this hotel is not bad. We've never had a problem walking around in the area. It's much quieter here than the Times Square area but still walkable to many sights or the subway. Close to Grand Central station, subways, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, Times Square, Central Park, and our favorite restaurant - Hillstone. We take the train into Penn Station so it's not as convenient to get to as it was when Amtrak was going into Grand Central.Not a terrible trip, but we'll probably try something closer to Penn Station on our next visit, maybe another brand.",lisav018,"lisav018</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>lisav018</strong>",0,3.0

I recently had a stay at Marriott this past weekend (8/16 - 8/18) along with my other family members. In total, we had about 15 hotels rooms that were booked with Marriott for our family reunion. Our check in was horrendous as the front desk personals seemed very uninterested in checking us in in a timely manner. Next, when we got to our room, our sheets were dirty (I found hairs once I pulled out the comforter and there were these very obvious stains on the sheets and on the pillow cases. Does management not check their hotel rooms? My other family members had their own problems with their hotel room (My uncles toilet wasn't flushing, my cousins room had a really bad cigarette stench, etc) but I'll let them write their own reviews. HOWEVER, the biggest complaint and the reason why I am writing this review is because I just saw a separate charge on my credit card for a hundred and some dollars and like any normal person, I went ahead and called the hotels line directly. I dialed the (212) - 755 - 4000 and got connected to a person who I believe was working at the front desk. I then inquired about my additional charge and this human being was being rude. She kept on yelling at me, kept cutting me off, and wouldn't even let me explain what is going on. What kind of customer service is this? I would never expect this from a hotel where we generated them so much business that weekend. Any who, I then politely asked the agent to just let me finish spelling out my name because clearly she wasn't understanding. Thats when she hung up on me. I then called about 1 minute later and it was the same agent. I politely asked for her name and then she hung up (clearly knowing who I was). I called for the third time, and she then screened my calls. I had my friend call her and inquire about something else and when my friend asked for her name, she said her name was Paula. All in all, Paula (if that is even her name) really does not deserve to be in this industry if she can't handle customers. Her service was unacceptable, inexcusable, and just disgusting. I hope that their is a way that you can rectify this situation, my experience, and Paula's behavior as this is not acceptable. - Laila H.",,lailafhafiz,2,1.0

The location is excellent, close to Times square (15 minute walk) and the subway (6 minutes). Staff were friendly and professional, and everything went smoothly with the stay. Easy check in and check out. Room was clean, bed and pillows were outstanding. Bill was correct. There’s even a $25 USD credit they give you when you leave (they explain it as giving back to the customer because the state charges a hotel tax). A lot of people are complaining about the rooms; they are small, especially the bathroom, and dated (carpets are older, rooms are a bit worn out). It’s NYC so be prepared for small rooms, but this Marriott is due for a Renovation soon I’m sure. One drawback is the lack of a pool, but most people probably don’t come to NYC to swim. Still though, reasonable value for money especially given the great location and excellent staff experience. To compare, I recently stayed at the Paris in Las Vegas for almost twice the price, and the Marriott east side staff were 100 times better, and so was our experience. Will likely return here.

The front desk staff said that our room wasn’t ready (expected that as check in is 3pm.). She asked for my cell number and said she would text as soon as our Room was ready. We planned to return to hotel after my medical appointment to rest a bit and change before dinner. That did not happen. The “room ready” text came in the form of a voice mail at 5:27pm. We returned to the hotel after dinner. Joshua finalized our check in. I mentioned that I was disappointed that our room was not ready until 5:30pm. He apologized and said that he would grant us complimentary access to the concierge level lounge and complimentary breakfast. I acknowledged that in a big way, stating that kindness goes very far, and we need a lot more of that currently in our broken world. We presented at the Lounge at 9:25am. We were in the middle of a line of approximately 8 people. When it became our turn to enter the lounge, the female staff member was very loud and curt when denying us access because we were “not entitled and Joshua did not notate our account.” We immediately returned to the front desk and found Joshua, again alone. I explained our embarrassment and he couldn’t even muster an apology. We returned to our room, gathered our belongings and returned to the front desk to check out. Carmen checked us out without even asking how our stay was. While our situation left no long term damage and we have moved on, as Marriott reward members, I will make a point to go out of my way to avoid Marriott brand hotel, especially the one that employs Joshua and Carmen, and others like them.

My wife and I do volunteer work in Bryant Park on a frequent basis. We thoroughly enjoy staying at the New York Marriot East Side for many different reasons which include : Location, Character, Service, M Club, Comfortable Beds, Nearby Restaurants and more. Often times people write General Managers to complain…that is not my style. If something needs to be taken care of, I speak up at the time. We just enjoyed spending a four day/three night weekend at your hotel which was fabulous and I wanted to call out some individuals that made our stay very special: Ron Rivera: We met Ron several years ago as we normally stayed at the Marriott Marquis. He always treated us like royalty and had his team take care of every detail of our needs for each visit. When he told us he was moving from W Downtown to the Marriott East Side, he invited us to stay and check out the property. We’ve been coming back regularly since that time. He is a consummate professional and makes clear that he appreciated our status/loyalty to Marriott properties. I’m sure that he will be a General Manager of a property in no time (I hope that it's also in Manhattan). Zach Donahue & Allan Hartwig: Both are two professional managers that care about details and reach out to us each time we are in residence. Zach and Allan were both extremely helpful during this visit. Jimmy & Michael Walsh: Both are outstanding doormen that are eager to please, do not try to “hustle” me and recall that we are frequent guests. Kenny & Michael Aromolo : These men are great. Hard workers, manage our suitcases and bags carefully/respectfully and are genuinely nice people. Yesterday we had a situation where we checked out at 11:30AM and asked the bell stand if they could bring things down and hold them in my wife’s name until we returned to the hotel with my car at 4:30pm. Everything worked flawlessly. Alexander: From Security. My family member was in the adjoining room and failed to pick up their items from the closet. The housekeeper put them in a bag and delivered them to security (which I understand is procedure). Alexander checked #1607 to make sure there was still nothing there, went down to security and brought up the bag of clothes to our room. Very kind. Joshua: At the front desk is always friendly and helpful. I had a problem with keys for M Club not working which he fixed at once. Also needed to light a candle and had no matches or lighter. He went out of his way to find some matches in the locker room, which was much appreciated. Joshua has in mind the history of the hotel and shared some very interesting details. Paulina Hernandez: At the front desk is extremely friendly and tons of fun. My family speaks Spanish and Portuguese so always enjoy an interesting exchange. She saw to it that all of our family members were checked in properly when they arrived on Saturday. Very informative, helpful and has delightful personality. Natascha: Housekeeping was an all-star. She was assigned to clean our suite up prior to guests arriving over the weekend and did a great job inside and outside. Everything was in perfect order and it was obvious that she put extra attention to preparing for us. I expressed our appreciation on Friday then told her that we were having friends/family over on Saturday. As always we would serve in disposable plates/cups so that they could be disposed of easily. She gave me some large garbage bags to use. Before everyone left on Saturday evening, we gathered together most of the trash and filled two bags which I gave to the houseman working the floor on Sunday morning. When we saw her on Sunday I explained and shared with her how she was truly appreciated.

My visit started when I was assigned a room across from an elevator. I asked to be moved and was accommodated. I was moved to a corner room. Two issues, the cable tv was malfunctioning and the toilet had a violent and loud flush. After an hour of being promised that an “engineer” would be up to fix the TV, I had to call again. Within 10 minutes a person came, worked on the tv and then when questioned about why the ESPN channel still wasn’t working (it’s March) he told us that they were having trouble with ESPN. I called to voice my disappointment. Five minutes later the front desk called to offer 10,000 reward points for my inconvenience, a nice gesture that was appreciated. My disappointment comes from the fact that I had to initiate the many requests for a solutions. No follow up and no real effort to proactively solve issues.Finally, there is no room service. Plus you are charged a $25 destination charge to experience NYC and/or to purchase items from the bar, an unnecessary gouge for the customer.

I have never had a 15% service charge included in every check -- regardless of the number of people served -- without being alerted. As a former waitress, i happily overtip -- but i was furious when i realized that i had tipped 25% on a check where i had already been charged 15% (this was for 2 drinks, not a party of 6+ where included service is standard). when I spoke with the server about my concern, i was told that it's standard Marriott policy and they have no control. Not only is that patently untrue (unless they changed policy last week and i didn't notice), it does not explain why the servers don't explicitly tell customers that a modest service charge is already included.

The location is excellent (located in mid town next to N/S subway and the E to Penn Station), the bed is comfy and the staff is excellent. The staff is truly very helpful, professional, interested and can think for themselves to resolve issues. The hotel is interesting from the street but ""faded"" inside. Having said that, if you travel a great deal for work like I do (north of 100 nights per year) not counting vacation travel, you will not like this hotel. Lets start with the coffee bar in the lobby, sponsored by Iilly that closes at noon and is not open again until 530/6pm and they will helpfully send you to the nearby Starbucks with a straight face. Seriously? Its 5 degrees outside, I do not want to go to Starbucks but I could drink the crap in the room (that stuff is fine at 530am when I am jet lagged and nothing opens until 630am in the city that never sleeps but not at 3pm in the afternoon) and I do not want to do that either. As well, the hotel is old and there is no heat in the bathroom, so that means no AC in the summer in the bathroom. They put in thru the wall system and it does not reach the bathroom but as a tease, the vent from the old system is still there. Did I mention that it was 5 degrees outside? Yes it was sporty in the morning after taking a shower. The final indignity is that the breakfast buffet is $35 and you have to go thru ""check point Charlie"" to reach it as it is in the M Club, which is for high members of Marriotts membership program (free for them, 35 bucks and a hassle for me). Let me clue the hotel Mgmt in on something, for $35 bucks, I need to see eggs Bennie, an omelet station, coffee from some virgin rain forest and a huge array of fruit, many of which have names I can not pronounce. Let me tell me Marriott this as well, given the last few charmless hotels of theirs that have I stayed in, I have no interest in reaching the level necessary to get a free ""breakfast"" (really a stretched continental break) or to get the points so on vacay I stay free as I do not want to stay in their hotels.

MINIMUM AMENITIES - The amenities are barely existent. Nothing besides soap, bath wash and shampoo was provided. No toothbrush, comb, cotton pad or even shower cap was provided.

But on my last trip to NYC, the Marriott East Side was the least expensive of the three so I decided to book it for my 2 night stay. Mistake! My room was disgusting! The carpet had obviously not been vacuumed recently as I stepped on not one but two pieces of food on the floor. Gross. The room itself was good size, although near the elevator so it was loud from the elevator itself and people talking waiting for it. I just turned on the fan for the night and it pretty much drowned that out though. But the condition of the room was the major disappointment. It is dated and just feels drab and dirty. The towels are thinner and look dingy. The curtains were ripped. The mattress and bedding all looked old too. The club lounge has been updated and moved to the second floor which was nice, but there were not enough tables to sit down for breakfast either morning nor for happy hour. I asked at checkout about any planned room renovations and they said yes the rooms need a renovation and it is being planned but not for a couple years. Well, thanks for the heads up, guess I will not stay there again until that time and would strongly recommend to others to choose another hotel until that time too. There are so many hotels in the same price range in that neighborhood that are in better condition (although I will also say the Lexington is starting to show its age too and it just renovated in the last 4 years or so). For those loyal to Marriott, now that Marriott and Starwood have combined, the Westin near Grand Central is a much better option as is the Residence Inn.

Best thing about this hotel was the location. My boyfriend and I walked everywhere with ease.

Has character. Check in was a a breeze. Hotel staff were great - front desk, concierge desk, gift shop clerk, cleaning staff and the lady who takes care of the M lounge on the 2nd floor. She was most accommodating in helping us one morning. Enjoyed the breakfast buffet in the lounge (not free however)Room had a fridge. Bathroom was roomy and bathtub drained well. TV was a flatscreen. There is a restaurant and a gift shop in the lobby. Lobby area was warm and inviting. Loved the hot chocolate and cookies served in lobby one evening. There are a few Starbucks locations near as well as a Duane Reade/Walgreens, liquor store and various food carts (which were all good btw). Tons of restaurants around. Wifi in the room worked for me just fine. I am a Marriott Rewards member so I did not pay for it. Cons:$25 daily resort fee - however, this can be used for food in the hotel restaurant or for a ticket to some form of New York entertainment. We used ours for food. It is a use it or lose it fee. Instead of complaining about it, just make use of it. Old building, so yes has character, but the rooms could use some updating. Our room was a King room, 6th floor facing front of building. Good room for a single or couple who really like each other and can stand close quarters. Small closet for two people to hang up things. One window could look into neighbors corner room and vice versa, so we had to keep shade drawn all the time. Window was drafty and we had to use towels to block cold air out. However, heating/cooling system worked well and was not noisy. Also nice touch covering it up. When we arrived, only 2 towels in the room and we had to call to get more. They were very quick to bring us towels which was nice. The room was clean but I had some observations. 1. Room smelled like wet dog/dirty mop especially in bathroom and that smell lingered the whole trip. 2. We found a contact lens on the floor and floor around nightstand/bed was dusty. Not sure if room was really vacuumed. I’ve noticed many comments about street noise. If you stay here you will hear cars and honking and sirens. You can use the noise cancelling options on the TV or wear earplugs. It’s New York City after all, the city that never sleeps.

We were allowed to check in early so that was nice. We were given a key to a room specification we didn’t reserve but the issue was immediately resolved and we settled into our two bed room. The rooms were more spacious than I anticipated which was super nice. The next morning we had a slow tub drain but after I called it was fixed. The staff were ALL really nice and helpful. The resort fee was a little unreasonable considering we were already paying a high cost for our room but I get it, a company can never make to much money (LOL being sarcastic). The $25 daily hotel food credit you get with each room reservation makes up for the daily resort fee ($25/day) but only if you remember to use it every day. Also take advantage of the free NYC attraction you accumulate daily you get with your room. We needed extra blankets so that was easy to obtain. It was an easy stay at the hotel. I will definitely come back and stay here again because we did have a good experience.

This covert charge is tacked onto your rate for the room and not made crystal clear to customers at any point in the booking process or the check in process. On receipt of our bill on check out, I was startled to see a $100 fee for a 4 night stay, plus city tax. As a frequent city traveller, I am accustomed to a citytax at the end of a stay, as this is a smallish charge, but a “resort/destination” fee is daylight robbery. This isn’t paying for the pool and cabanas to be maintained in Grand Bahama, this is a New York City Hotel, not a resort. On check in, we were presented with a hotel coupon giving us $25 worth of food and beverage credit, a gift from the hotel gift shop and $20 of complimentary dry cleaning. We took this coupon and assumed it was due to status as a Marriott rewards member. We did not wish to eat/drink in the Marriott hotel so we didn’t utilise this. (The Marriott Hotel desk clerk said to us on check out that this $25 food credit could have been used daily but even if we had known this, we wouldn’t have spent extra money on dining within the property as a party of 3, even with the coupon). As a consumer, I do not wish $25 worth of credit towards your extortionately priced hotel food services. I would prefer to NOT be charged a resort fee and i would mostly prefer to eat and drink somewhere else (in a city with the culinary calibre of New York the choices are infinite). Warning: Marriott has instigated this daily resort fee charge across their Manhattan hotels and on reading further about this charge, there are concerns that this means that hotels are weasling their way out of paying taxes to NY state. As of 2018, Marriott is one of 85 hotels in NYC who tack on this “destination/resort” charge. I can’t complain about the the hotel amenities, beds and cleanliness-these were fine but you can easily find similar rooms around New York City without a destination fee scam. Marriott would do well to take note and charge their customers an honest upfront price for a hotel room (with a modestly smal NY city tax as extra) as it is well known that consumers do not like hidden extras and being “dinged” at check out with an extra charge. It has been said that a dissatisfied customer will tell 15 friends about their negative experience. I will certainly be telling all my friends and acquaintances about your resort fee practices to warn them away from booking and staying with you.","London, United Kingdom","PassportStampsKatie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",3,1.0

I lived in NYC for years, so I'm familiar with cockroaches. But, I don't expect to see them on the 15th floor of a brand name hotel. I ended up killing the roach and immediately calling the front desk to request another room. After I explained the situation, I was told that there weren't any other rooms available for the night. After I continued to argue and complained to the night manager, a room was suddenly available (wow!) - but, I was made aware that this was a great inconvenience to the hotel and that they would need to ""move some things around for me"". After hours or arguing with front desk staff and waiting around in an infested room, I was finally moved. After my stay, I submitted a message via Marriott.com and was referred to the hotel staff, who referred me to the hotel manager (Ron)....who never responded. After a followup three weeks later, an assistant manager (Allan) finally emailed me saying that this situation is ""very unusual"" and that the room was treated after my stay (because that really helped me...). I never received a response to my response back to him (it's been 6 days), never heard an apology during or after checkout, and continue to have the impression that I seriously ""inconvenienced"" the hotel because of my ""unusual"" situation.

It started with our check-in experience. The front desk check-in line was practically out the door; there was only one clerk....with it being a holiday weekend, you would think they would have staffed at least two, maybe three people. After waiting about 20 minutes, I complained to the bellmen & asked if there was anyone else to help. After a few more minutes, another clerk finally came out to the front desk. When we eventually reached the desk, of course the room wasn’t ready, but they promised to have it ready by 4 pm. 4pm came and went and still no call from the Marriott. I finally called and complained that I needed to rest from traveling all day, and eventually secured a room. Meanwhile, our luggage had been stored in a large, unlocked ballroom with many other people’s luggage. Apparently no one’s room had been ready. Even though they had given me a ticket for the luggage, I still had to go back to the ballroom and show the bellhop which bags were ours...(probably could have taken someone else’s luggage & they never would have known the difference). When we finally reached the room, we learned that, even though we had a large size room with 2 double beds, the bathroom was the size of a tiny closet. I realize that this is NYC, but you couldn’t even open/close the door without maneuvering yourself out of the way of the toilet.During our stay, we called for extra towels, (twice repeatedly), which never arrived....finally had to go into the hallway and hunt for the maid’s cart in order to get a clean towel for a shower. As for the daily additional fee of $25, we were told that it’s mandatory, but can be used at the cafe downstairs. However, the “cafe” is merely a food stand with a few drinks, bananas, and pastries. To make matters worse, it closes at noon! After that, you are out of luck if you want anything to eat or drink, (there is no in-room dining and they actually have the nerve to charge for bottled water delivered to the room...this is complimentary at many of the hotels I’ve stayed at).Overall,I just can’t find anything nice to say about this Marriott, and truly wished we had stayed somewhere else.","Delray Beach, Florida","27Jazz27</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Delray Beach, Florida</strong>",33,1.0

Ideally situated in Midtown East with the building having a bit of history (opened in 1924) and was even the ""star"" of Homeland in Season 5, Episode 1, the Marriott East Side has such potential to be a great hotel. Unfortunately as others have posted, this hotel, especially the rooms, desperately needs a makeover. As a frequent visitor of NYC for work in the neighborhood, this property is never my first choice. I hate to be so harsh (because otherwise the hotel is acceptable and people who work here are nice and work hard to please their guests), but the only word I ever use to describe the rooms and experience of staying here is ""depressing."" The mustard yellow/maroon décor/carpet, coupled with dark trims, old furniture (that old, ugly red chair!) and dark sheer curtains -- I just can't stand it. Everything is just old. The hotel stopped providing room service a couple of years ago. Getting to the fitness center is a chore -- you have to take two separate elevators, three if your room is lower than floor 16, I think. The other Marriott hotels that have renovated now have great shower heads, with an option of a handheld, and plenty of water pressure! The East Side still has those big ones that spout water with absolutely no pressure, making for a terrible showering experience.Some positive comments: while not my first choice, I'll probably stay here again (location, staff is nice).

With a concierge lounge that it always open, even on weekends, it’s is understandable that Marriott regulars choose this location. However, the so called destination fee is nothing but an invisible tax, upping both the room rate and the concomitant taxes in a less than transparent way.There is no pool, no spa, no room service. The gift shop is not considered a part of the hotel, so the “fee” cannot be spent there. I was looking for lunch or an afternoon snack, and there is no place to do so in th hotel, so I cannot even use my “fee”. Turns out, it has very limited use and is mostly a scam.As I booked several rooms for several days, I have several hundred dollars of these fees, which is nothing more than Marriott picking my pockets, even while I pay a pretty higher room rate even for NYC. I have complained repeatedly to the front desk and concierge desk that I find the fee unreasonable and my inability to use it for lunch absolutely absurd. It is unusually unprofessional behavior for a Marriott, clearly not well thought out, and even less well implemented. But I do a lot of Marriott business, so absent a refund or credit, I’ll just use a different property in NYC until management here gets the message.

I called back that next day and spoke the manager. He looked into it and said he would credit me the points immediately. Lo, it is now more than a week later and no points.

We sat on the curb waiting for the next bus for over a half hour, that bus was broken they took it out of service.

First, I think it was very important to point out that people need to get over the fact places in Manhattan have small[er] rooms than what they might be used to. Manhattan is roughly 23 square smiles, housing about 4 million people a weekday. The place is busy and crowded! There just isn't enough room for decently priced, very spacious hotels.Anyways...PROS: The location is key! It's within walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Grand Central Station, and two subway stations. Any Lyft/Uber drivers had no problem finding the place. A Duane Read (essentially a Walgreens) is also a short walk. On the same street, for those who don't want to venture off to try a non-chain coffee place, there is a Starbucks close by. Across the street and down a street is a 24-hour market that had sandwiches and snacks and whatnot. The room, yes was a little small, but for two people it was perfect. Our goal was to not spend a lot of time in our hotel rooms anyways. The room was very clean and the bathroom was actually a decent size that was also very clean. The shower had great water pressure. There wasn't a lot of counter space in the bathroom, but the shelf under the sink was perfect for stashing our toiletry bags. We put our suitcases near the window where they were small little area that was out of the way since our suitcases were sort of big. It helped free up some space. One thing I really liked was that if you had the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on your door but housekeeping saw you when you left your room, they would ask if you needed your room serviced. The women we ran into were always very friendly and nice and did service our room. One morning we didn't see them in the hallway, so we just asked the front desk to have our room serviced and it wasn't a problem. The people working at the front desk and Milton (I think that was his name) who worked at the other desk (not concierge but the other one) were very friendly and seemed very willing to help. CONS: One great thing is if you arrive too early and your room isn't ready, you can check your bags and walk around. Well, the men working at the bag check weren't very friendly. They weren't rude, just not friendly. The bellhop guys weren't very helpful either. Sometimes they would press the button to open the door for you, but that was it. No one offered to help with our bags when we arrivesSo one thing that really annoyed me was, the night we got in, my boyfriend and I were tired and decided that since we got $25 off food at the restaurant in the hotel, we would just eat there. When we asked if there was take out, they said there was. When we had mentioned we were going to take it to our room, we weren't corrected on that, so we assumed they would bring it up to our room. Well, when I called the restaurant about 10 minutes after dinner started, they told us they didn't do room service. That's fine, no big deal. I put in our order and they said it would be ready in about 20 minutes. About 20 minutes goes by and they are slammed. We go to the bar to pick up the food and they say it will be a minute or two. Okay, cool. I decide to just pay while I was at the bar so when the food was ready, we could just go. Well, when I looked at the bill, there was an $8 service charge because I took it to-go! It wasn't delivered to us. It was to go. I have never seen a charge on a to-go order a person had to pick up themselves. No one had articulated to us that there would be a charge. If we would have known that, we might have just eaten at the actual restaurant or gone elsewhere.Even though I'm glad we didn't. At the actual restaurant, it was busy and it seemed like the wait staff was slow. I watched a few customers come up to the bar, looking very impatient. As far as the food goes, my boyfriend got the burger and said it was pretty good. I had the pappardelle pasta and added shrimp to it. I don't think it had a sauce with it, so it was just noodles with some veggies. Filling, sure, but nothing to write home about. It was very expensive, even with the $25 off. I don't think it's worth it. There are plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Try one of those instead. The elevators are small and a little slow, but honestly they aren't that bad when you don't have all of your luggage and you aren't in a rush. As I said before, overall we enjoyed our stay there. I would look into what free attractions you can do at the concierge. We didn't have time to do them, but it's worth looking into. I would recommend this hotel.","Pinellas Park, Florida","bumblebee713</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pinellas Park, Florida</strong>",20,4.0

The cleaning staff were attentive and diligent!The cons:The space can use an update and I mean major renos! The room itself would be okay but for a carpet that made me nervous to walk on barefoot.

We’d reserved 2 rooms. One for us and one for our children (not young). We really wanted one of the rooms to be available immediately so we could leave bags and freshen up before heading out for the day. With my husbands’s Marriott status we were upgraded no problem to a very nice room that was available immediately. The other room we would be notified when it was available. We were told where the M Club was as well as hours. Front desk clerk told us it was still open for breakfast (Sunday stays open later). We were also told there was a $25 per night per room resort fee. Of course with NYC adding tax and fees it was more like $33. You are able to use it a few ways. Since it was $50 for us with the 2 rooms we ate one night in the restaurant. Food was good, not great. We stopped in the M Club and had breakfast. The M Club has a great spread of hot and cold items. I’ll just say options were plentiful, replenished regularly and very good. There were quite a few staff working the area. It was definitely busy. Other times we stopped in for hors d’oeuvre’s and there was always a nice assortment. The elevators were usually an issue, very slow and packed with people. They are very small and not air conditioned. Almost every time people had waited quite a while so when the doors opened every last person tried to get themselves in. Not an issue that will be solved if they are busy. We did check out the kids room with 2 double beds it was also a nice room. They had a corner room with 2 sides of windows. There was more then a decent amount of space for NYC standards. It was on the 4 th floor and you could definitely hear more street noise from their room. Our room had a spacious, well lit vanity counter with large mirror outside the bathroom. It was great because the bathroom sink had no counter area at all. The only issue was there was no outlet to plug the hairdryer into. Makes no sense. Especially since the bathroom sink had nowhere to put a blow dryers or brushes down. Also, it would be especially nice to have a close up makeup mirror on that counter, but there was none. I had to blow dry my hair at the desk which had a electrical plug and another mirror.

It apparently includes $25 per day credit in the bar and a $20 per day dry cleaning credit. I had no problem paying the additional fee. The issue was the $45 dry cleaning charge and the $75 bar charge upon check out. I was told by the front desk staff that it was a “daily fee” to be “used daily” or you forfeit it. Since I had all my dry cleaning some at once ($65) I was only credited $20. The same with the bar bill of $95. I was credited $25.First of all, I’m in New York! Why would I want to visit the Marriott lobby bar and eat the dreadful food 3 nights in a row? In fact both the service and cocktails sucked! In addition, why would I wait all day 3 days in a row for dry cleaning? I simply wanted my dress shirts and jacket all done in one day. Obviously the charge is to get you to spend even more at the hotel. However platinum elite members who spend over 75 nights a year at Marriott hotels should never be charged the fee in the first place. And although I was not angry about the fee but I was appalled that a simple dry cleaning bill for a business meeting held AT the hotel were even charged to me. I will most likely never return to this rather dated, aging and disappointing hotel. I much prefer the Lexington Hotel next door for their excellent customer service, staff and attitude.

It is very well located and close to the office, therefore has been my first choice. Of late however, a number of things have started bothering me about this place. The elevators for one are very slow and in the mornings (8am-9am) or evenings (5pm-6pm) it isn't uncommon to wait 8-10 mins to get one.The 2nd reason that I am downgrading a previous review (think I gave it 4 or 4.5 stars in that one) is that I've noticed that the rooms and particularly the washrooms, aren't clean to a level I'd expect for a hotel where on average I pay $350/night. A number of times now I've found it fairly dusty, the toilet not really cleaned from the outside and open packs of the q-tips that they put in the washrooms. That tells me that they're changing the sheets and vacuuming the place and then running through the rest of the cleaning. For all hotel stays I have always left tips for the service staff as they work hard in cleaning the rooms and don't get paid much (plus not too many people think of leaving tips for them)...but I have stopped leaving tips now at this Marriott.The people at the front desk though are really nice and that along with the location is the only reason I'm not giving the hotel 1 or 2 stars. Unfortunately, the owners am sure know that they can always fill enough rooms (it is NY after all) so they don't want to invest in upgrading the facilities including the elevators, which are functional, but not efficient.Sadly I'm going to have to look at alternatives and give my $5000/month business to another hotel.","Darien, Connecticut","sidv1571</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Darien, Connecticut</strong>",31,3.0

I have stayed in many Marriott properties around the US and this is by far the worst.

I asked to be upgraded to a decent room, and was charged an extra $100 for the pleasure - even though I arrived after midnight, and there was no way they would have sold the room to anyone else at that point. I never do this (and it's the last thing I would want to do on a business trip), but I changed my reservation and moved to a new hotel the following day (the Knickerbocker Hotel - highly recommended) where I was allocated a really great room at a cheaper rate. When I told the staff at the Marriott that I would be changing my reservation and finding a new hotel, they didn't make any effort to address the situation.

I waited for another in my party at the lobby and it is a small space that always seemed fairly loud and bustling. The cafe in the lobby is very highly priced (expensive coffee, $6 small bottle of Gatorade) and uses K-cups instead of using ground espresso. There was generally a line for this cafe as this property charges a $25 per-night fee (like a resort fee) that can be used for ""free drycleaning"" and a $25 worth of credit shops/restaurants. The elevators were a bit on the small side but fast and functional, with two banks: one for the lower part of the building and one for the upper floors. Internet was free in the lobby but an extra charge in the rooms.The room itself was perfectly fine with a nice king-sized bed, closet, and safe. The bathroom was a bit on the small side and required a bit of shuffling for closing the door while inside it.

We went to our room and asked to speak to a manager to explain we didn’t want to avail of this and Pam informed us that it was already paid for on our Priceline booking.When we came to leave, the fee was on the bill. Richard, the manager on duty then informed us that it is stated on Priceline but not debited which turned out to be correct. It just created a feeling of uncertainty throughout the weekend.The room was fine if quite dated.

After getting my confirmation number, I read the reviews on Trip Advisor and learned that the hotel was in need of some renovation but that the rooms on the 16th floor had been refurbished. I then called the hotel directly (or so I thought). The operator directed me to reservations. I explained what I had learned and requested that my 3 rooms be located on the 16th floor--2 adjoining rooms and the other located nearby. No problem (or so I thought). We arrived for check-in shortly after 3 p.m. Only one room was ready -- on the 4th floor! When I explained to the front desk check-in clerk that I was told my rooms would be on the 16th floor, she said that those rooms were ""premium"" rooms. I explained that Sherry in Reservations told me that I would be assigned 3 rooms on the 16th floor as requested. I learned that Sherry was actually in Omaha--not at the NY hotel! The check-in person proceeded to get her manager who told me that the rooms were premium rooms and they had none available for me. While disappointed, I agreed to take the rooms on the 4th floor. We were escorted to the room on the 4th floor with all of our luggage and were told that we would be notified just as soon as the other rooms became available. No notification came so we went down to the front desk to get the other keys. We were given a key to one of the adjoining rooms. The third room still was not ready. We were told that a bellman would bring the 3rd key up to us. We waited about 30 minutes and decided to leave and pick up the 3rd key when we returned to the hotel. Upon returning, we went to the front desk to get the key to our 3rd room. The front desk clerk looked a bit puzzled and said, ""You didn't already get your key?"" We told her what we were told earlier. She gave us the key. My 2 guests proceeded to their adjoining rooms only to discover that someone else was already checked into that room. Back down to the front desk! The front desk clerk was very apologetic and gave me a $50 credit off the cost of one rooms and access for all 3 rooms to the M Lounge. She also indicated that she needed to have the name of each guest in each of the rooms, which the first check-in clerk failed to do. She then proceeded to find us unoccupied rooms. She sent us to the 21st floor with a bellman to transfer our luggage from the 4th floor to the 21st floor. Two of us got into our rooms; the bellman opened the door to the 3rd room only to discover that a gentleman was already in the room! Finally by about 10:00 p.m. we got a 3rd unoccupied room. One of my guests ended up having to leave a day early. The bill arrived under my door Sunday morning. I didn't think anything of this since I was paying for all 3 rooms. I got my daughter into a car for the airport and went to the M Lounge to get some coffee. My key didn't work but the man behind me used his key and I got in to the lounge. I then proceeded to my room only to discover that my key would not open the door to my room. Back down to the front desk! You guessed it . . . the hotel checked me out of my room instead of checking my daughter out of her room.This is certainly not the experience I expected to have from a Marriott Hotel. Marriott is always my first choice when selecting a hotel. I did get a response to my survey comments from someone at the hotel who offered to be my contact person and give me an upgraded room on my next visit to the New York Marriott East Side. I explained that I do not travel to NYC that frequently so her offer was not of much value to me. I also explained that the $25/day per room ""destination fee"" was nothing more than a junk fee, as I received no benefit from this fee plus the attendant taxes on this fee. I have not had any additional response from the hotel. As far as the hotel goes, the rooms were clean but did look a little tired. The bathroom in the king bed room was small. The bathroom door came within 2-3 inches of the toilet. There is not much sound-proofing. If someone was talking as they walked down the hall, you could hear the conversation in the room. You could also hear all the traffic noise in the streets below.Based on this experience, I doubt that I would return to this particular Marriott Hotel. I appreciated the check-in clerk trying to make up for the check-in fiasco but $50 off the price of one room seems a little lacking since we were all inconvenienced by the mistakes of their back office personnel.",Atlanta (Marietta) Georgia,"GeorgiaPeach76</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta (Marietta) Georgia</strong>",1,2.0

I looked on their site and it looks like they have some rooms that are 'premier' and a little more up dated, but we had booked the standard double bedded room and you could tell it had not been renovated in a very very long time.Bathrooms especially need some help. That might have been the worst and longest shower I have ever taken in my life. I am 5'2"" so the shower head was perfect height for me, but not for my 6'1"" husband who had to bend to get his head wet.

We spoke with many of the concierge and they were all beyond friendly and helpful. The lounge was a huge benefit for us and was always stocked with good options. We wanted to give a HUGE online Thank You to Kenda the concierge. One evening we went up to see what desserts were out and started talking with the concierge in the lounge. My daughter couldn't have the option because she is gluten-free. She's a teen and used to this and was perfectly fine with that, but Kenda felt bad there wasn't anything for her.

You really don't see this type of customer service on a regular basis. She went above and beyond to make our stay just that much nicer. It was completely unnecessary and unexpected.

Staff were very friendly and when I arrived at the hotel the television wasn't working correctly. After having a maintenance man visit I was told it was not fixable and so I was moved swiftly to an alternative room. The rooms felt a little like they were partially refurbished with new beds / TVs etc but with things like the decor, doors, windows, and the safe feeling like they had been in situ for some time. I believe I was in a standard room (which was a bit of a disappointment as I am a Marriott Gold card holder and they should upgrade you if they have availability). It was a decent size although the bathroom was very small. As the building is old, the room shape was a little quirky :-)For those who like to use room service be aware that there is no room service at this property. However they let me order via phone from the restaurant and then I just ran down to collect it :-) I can recommend the Macaroni cheese. The Executive Lounge was generally pretty busy (the hotel is fairly close to a number of office locations so is a prime option for business travellers) but there was a choice of hot food and cold items at breakfast time plus juices, yoghurts, pastries, bagels etc. I didn't check out the evening offering but did nip in to get a bottle of water most evenings.

Of course in New York you expect high prices and small sizes, but this hotel is very dated, dirty, and rooms are tiny. Our room had plug plates falling off of the walls (had to be a safety hazard), non-working outlets on the desk/desk lamp, and very dirty window sills and windows. The provided hairdryer was disgusting and looked like it had never been cleaned (covered in hair, dust, dirt, and hairspray). Road noise, while expected to a degree, was also bad. The bathroom was insanely small and had water damage on the ceiling and walls and dirt everywhere. The service was disappointing too. One member of our party was in need of a hair straightener (a pretty standard beauty/self-care item in this day and age) and the front desk staff was incredulous; like they could not believe we would request such a thing. They flatly pointed us to the closest Duane Reade with no apology. In addition, on check-in the staff provided no information about a business center, gym, breakfast or gift shop information, etc. I look younger than I am and feel that being treated this way might have had something to do with that (frustrating in itself).

Staff were friendly on arrival, no issues checking in. The lobby has a feeling of old charm. The hotel is perhaps in need of a modern day makeover, but I had no complaints. The corridors, carpets and bedroom doors do look a bit dated, but the bedroom itself was fine. Pictures posted by guests on Trip Advisor are reflective of what you'll get.We got a great rate in advance for a Friday night a few weeks ago and jumped at this one. The room we had was pleasant, bright, spacious and clean. Some reviews say they are small rooms, but if you look at the guests pictures where someone has photographed the floor plan from the back of the hotel door, you can see how varied they are. We were in a square corner room. Every time we've been at this property, it's been in a corner room with double aspect - purely by chance, so this is my only experience I can comment on. There was plenty of drawer space, a chair by the bed, a separate desk and chair, built in wardrobe and working safe. The room even had an empty fridge. It didnt have a mini bar with contents, but I prefer this. There was also an in-room coffee maker. This room size would be great if you were here for a few days or a week's visit. You could easily unpack.Even the bathroom was a descent size. There was a massive shower head in the bathroom (like the sort that comes down from the ceiling but in this case, it was attached to the wall and the water pressure amazing. A real wake up and not the usual dribble I was expecting! Bathroom had the usual Marriott Amenities - hair shampoo, conditioner, body lotion etc.Room had good air con and it wasn't noisy. We were on the 18th floor, so we didn't hear much road traffic noise, except the odd police siren, so I suspect the windows are not that soundproof, but up high, that's not an issue. If you are in the inner section of the hotel, in one of the U's, so you face the building you will loose the view but I suspect it's quieter.The bed was large, clean and very comfortable.We are Marriott Gold so had free internet access and access to the Lounge on the second level. Of all the hotel clubs, this is my favorite. This hotel's club was also open on a Saturday morning for a really decent breakfast - cold and hot items. There was also free water, cold sodas and a coffee machine in the lounge.

The elevators are so small and SLOW, and was uncomfortable when the elevators were packed. Many couples in the elevator also shared their concerns too with the hotel. For starters, I booked our trip with Marriott Vacations and am disappointed with Management on the outcome of our complaints. When we thought we were getting a rollaway bed brought to our room, there was a couch that opened into a bed but this was horrible, the bed opened up against our bed and for the other person on the other side of the bed had to get up to use restroom etc, had to climb over the bed, there was no room at all in this room to walk around and my husband is disabled. The rooms are outdated. In addition to that we heard a leak/drip in the shower all night long which my husband took a video. The most horrific part of this was when security banged on our door early the next morning and asked for ID because he thought we didn't belong in that room. He scared the heck out of us, I could not attend the seminar that Marriott Vacation was holding because I was so upset. I will say that the front desk moved us into another room after all we went through, NOT Marriott Vacation. Upon returning from our trip, I called Marriott Vacation to complain about our stay and what I was told was that they would not charge us for the difference in rate change for room for not attending the seminar. I cannot believe we were not compensated in points or something for all that we went through. I must also add when I booked my stay, I was told there was 16 rooms available with two beds and when I call back in a month to pay there would be rooms available and there WERE NOT. This was the beginning of our nightmare, that where the rollaway bed came into the story.A disappointed Marriott customer for sure.",,Cinscan1,1,2.0

We usually stay at a hotel one block south (a Marriott affiliate) but I felt like I needed a little change so I went with the New York Marriott East Side. We got there around 9:30pm after driving in from Boston and check in was great. I was assured that we would have a king bed room. The man at the desk (was very pleasant) said something along the lines of, ""you'll be in a great room on a high floor"". I assumed this meant a great view. Clearly I was wrong in assuming that. We were up on the 28th floor (2802) to be exact. When I entered the room I realized how dark it was, even with the light on (this light would no longer turn on by the end of the trip). The room was a decent size for NYC. I walked over to the only window in the corner of the room to look at the ""view"". I opened the blinds to find....a brick wall staring right back at me. We went out to walk around for a bit and came back around 11pm and my husband wanted to catch some updates from the NFL Draft. Something kept happening with the TV and it kept freezing and you couldn't even turn the TV off. My husband had to keep getting up and UNPLUGGING the TV every 5 minutes to get in unfrozen. The next morning we went into the M Club Lounge for a nice buffet brunch. The staff in the Lounge and also the housekeeping staff were some of the nicest people here!!! We stayed for 2 nights and left on Sunday. I do have to make sure to include the bed in our room was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. We called the hotel on the way home to see what kind of bed it was but they just told us to look at shopmarriott.com (which did not have the manufacturer information).","Boston, Massachusetts","MaRea04252</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",10,3.0

Naturally access to the subway is convenient but don't assume travel on the subway will always be quick, allow enough time to get from A to B. It's easy to get from JFK to the hotel by subway but it will be crowded in rush hour. Grand Central Terminal is a 15 minute or so walk.Being an Elite Member lounge access is a perk that's important to me. It's always a bit of a mystery which lounges are open on which days.

This cannot hold a candle to other M Club experiences I have had. Even though it is open 24 hours there are no snacks Fri-Sun. The only thing I saw was a Nature Valley granola bar which was gone later in the evening. If I had paid an extra $100 for ""access"" I would have been looking for a refund. What are people paying for on the weekends? In addition to the limited amenities, the setting was simply repurposed conference space with the room divider pulled open.

Plenty of food and shopping close by. There is a sales counter for Marriott vacations trying to make a sale so unless you are interested, steer clear; it's placed right by the concierge desk and in front of the bar. The bar looked busy, I didn't go in so can't speak to that. The rooms are fine. Not very large but not super small either. Decent size bathroom, again nothing spectacular. Closet, dresser, side tables, plenty of room to unpack and store your things. Also a mini-fridge (not a minbar though, just a fridge to store your things, which is nice actually) and a safe. A single cup coffeemaker as well. The shampoo/soap etc is fine and restocked daily. Decent water pressure but I did start to lose heat and have to adjust before the end of my shower and I'm not a 40 minute shower person.

You couldn't ask for a better location. Close to Grand Central Station, close to shopping and many restaurants, walking distance to Times Square and the Theatre District. The room itself was a disappointment. While I hadn't expected a spacious room (square footage is expensive in NYC), I was disappointed in how dark and dreary it was. The carpet and upholstered chair weren't exactly dirty, but they were dingy. Also, every surface was black: table tops, dresser, desk, bathroom counter. Not only did that add to the oppressive darkness of the room, but it was hard to find objects placed on them: cell phone, iPad, small objects, etc.Although I didn't have to pay for Wi-Fi, I think it's ridiculous that, in this day and age, it isn't offered as a free amenity. The bathroom is small but well lit. No magnifying mirror, and it took me two days before I realized the hairdryer was hanging in a black bag in the closet. The bathroom amenities were very basic: one bar of soap, one shampoo, conditioner and lotion. No shower cap. I travel with my own mirror and shower cap, so I was fine, but be forewarned. The towels were plentiful and thick.What I absolutely hated was the shower. It's a regular tub shower with a bowed-out shower curtain, which is fine, but I think they did one of those remodeling jobs where they place a new tub liner over the old tub. That's the only explanation for the fact that the bottom of the tub is like a large bubble...it moves when you're standing on it! It was like showering while standing up in a canoe! Anyone with even the slightest balance problems will be terrified of it. After a few days, I figured out that if I placed my feet on the outermost edges of the tub floor, I wouldn't feel so insecure. Water pressure was excellent, though. (But I really, really hated the tub.)The elevators were outrageously slow. Now, I understand at peak times this would be a problem, but one had to almost always wait a ridiculous amount of time, regardless of the time of day. Then when the elevator would arrive, it might be so full, you couldn't get on it. Unacceptable.The best part of the Marriott East Side was the M Lounge, but that's only available to people who upgrade. They have wonderful buffet breakfasts (scrambled eggs, scrambled egg-whites with spinach, bacon, potatoes, cereals, fresh fruit, pastries, bagels). Delicious coffee and fresh orange or grapefruit juice. There are always small bottles of water, cans of soda, and small containers of Dannon yogurt available 24 hours. They do more food at dinner time, but I always missed that; ditto the dessert hour. The eating areas in the M Lounge are very nice: some are traditional tables. some are sofa areas, others are counters with stools. This is spread over an area of two fairly large rooms. One morning, I had a lovely conversation with the concierge on duty. I don't mean a brief, ""Hello, are you enjoying your stay?"" kind of exchange, but a genuine conversation lasting perhaps 10 minutes. Very nice touch, especially when one is traveling alone.So, would I stay at the Marriott East Side again? Perhaps. The lack of room service, the overall dreariness of the room, and the ridiculously long wait for elevators would give me pause. However, the location is great, and the M Lounge was extremely nice (did I mention there's no room service?) There are a lot of other hotels in the area. I might try another one before staying at the Marriott East again. it would depend, of course, on the price.","New York City, New York","Sai I</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",10,3.0

We elected this hotel because it is in a nice location, I am a Marriott member, and it just off the hustle and constant bustle of Times Square. We got in at 1:00 am after a long travel day. Paulina welcomed us with a bright smile and was so kind. As an Elite member, I asked for an upgrade. Unfortunately, there was a business conference and there wasn't an upgrade available, but she told me to stop back the next day and she'd work something out-and, thankfully, she kept that promise. We got a very nice corner room for the last several nights of our stay. She also made us feel very special every time we saw her. The concierge lounge was great for our family for breakfast. Lots of great options and very delicious. We also stopped up a time or two for happy hour/apps before dinner. It was nice to be able to grab an apple and some waters to snack on throughout our busy tourist days. The concierge, Margaret, was very helpful - she helped us several times. Thanks for the great stay. We loved NYC! I do think if we come back we might choose the Marriott Marquis as we spent a lot of time in that area and with the rainy weather we had most of the week, it would have been nice to be a little more central. But, this hotel was awesome and highly recommended. Paulina was awesome!Try the 212 Steakhouse just a few blocks away.

Also, we had a huge issue with using the club lounge at this Marriott.

My only real complaint is room service. “We don’t offer traditional room service,” I was told after a grueling 18 hour flight that left me hungry and too tired to go find a restaurant and actually sit upright without falling asleep. But they actually don’t offer any room service at all. I am not even sure they had a vending machine.

I return again and again because the Marriott East Side always meets my high expectations for a relatively small, full service hotel in a big city environment. There are at least seven good reasons why I choose the Marriott East Side when I stay in NYC:First, while the Marriott East Side, with 646 rooms, may seem large on paper, it is a postage stamp compared to the Marriott Marquis in Times Square, the Midtown Hilton, the Waldorf Astoria, and other large hotels in NYC, with their multiple restaurants, bars, shops, and amenities that I would never use. The Marriott East Side has one bar, one restaurant, and a small gift shop, and is rarely crowded with the busloads of tourists that can overwhelm other places. Although the Marriott East Side might be a big hotel in a small city, it plays like a small hotel in a big city. Second, the historic building with its compact, Art Deco lobby and public areas, is warm, inviting, and an aesthetic delight. Third, the staff at the front desk is professional, efficient, and accommodating, and I especially appreciate their efforts to book me into my favorite rooms. (Like many hotels in historic buildings, the room sizes and configurations can vary considerably. As a long time, regular guest, I have my favorite rooms, floor, and view.) Fourth, many of the doormen, lobby attendants, bartenders, and housekeepers, have worked at the hotel for years, and they obviously like their jobs and enjoy interacting with the guests.Fifth, the Hotel is located on the cusp of three safe residential neighborhoods (Turtle Bay, Murray Hill, and the Upper East Side), where tourists are scarce and real Manhattanites live, eat, and drink; and yet, the midtown business district, theater district, and Grand Central Terminal are only a short walk away. And for those people who like to explore, two subway stations are within eyesight (4, 5, 6, E and M lines) for easy access to the rest of the City. Sixth, while some of the rooms are a bit small or in need of a touch-up, they are very clean and comfortable. Lastly, for Elite Marriott Reward Members, the Concierge Room on the second floor is outstanding with one of the best breakfast buffets that I have experienced at any Marriott and an evening hors d'oeuvre spread that could pass for a light dinner.I obviously recommend the Marriott East Side.",United States,"HVRoadWarrior</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United States</strong>",116,5.0

This hotel is mid-town east and is walking distance to Times Square, Radio City Music Hall, Central Park, Grand Central Terminal and a bunch of great restaurants and attractions. For the location, it's price is actually pretty good. The lobby is actually very nice and when we came in December was decorated seasonally and was very festive. The hotel gym was on the top floor (I think 35th or something like that) and had a nice view of the surrounding buildings, the East River, and Brooklyn to the south and Queens to the North. But for positives, that was pretty much it.Now for the items that disappointed us.1. We are Marriott Gold Elite members, where Marriott typically automatically upgrades your room upon arrival. I believe our room was actually downgraded to the lowest quality room available. We stayed on the 6th floor in a corner room. The toilet flushed slowly and the sink drained slowly. The room was dark, poorly lit, and several outlets did not work. There was no alarm clock. There was no luggage rack in our room (but we discovered later there were racks in other rooms). No hangers. When asked if we could switch rooms, they said no.2. The service was pretty poor. When we called and asked for things like toilet paper, tissues, a luggage rack, we were met with responses like, ""they'll be right up."" A day later, we grabbed some toilet paper from a cleaning lady's cart, and when she found us doing this, she asked if we needed anything else, to which she found us a luggage rack in another room, and gave it to us. Thank goodness for her!3. The M lounge was pretty pathetic. I've stayed at other Marriott's where there was a much better selection of snacks, fruit, appetizers, and desserts pretty much at any time. This one only had Nutrigrain bars and diet Pepsi. The breakfasts were not too bad though.4. The gym was pretty nice as stated above. However the elevator from the 32nd to 35th floor stopped and a cleaning person was caught in there for a few minutes. I was thankful they had stairs.OverallIf you don't care about the amenities and service and are looking for a location, this is pretty prime real estate.

With your status you can go into the Lounge, which offers free breakfast and some drinks. But if you compare this for example to the Copenhagen Marriott, the lounge is really basic. The location is OK. It's a few blocks from the shopping area and the staff is nice. But the rooms are getting old and are running down.

Initially, we stayed 8 nights while enjoying all the Big Apple has to offer and we were very happy with this hotel. Travelling with two teenage boys challenges our family on room configurations and possibilities and this hotel had the ideal space. We enjoyed a suite with a lounge-room (with fold out bed) and a bedroom (with two double beds) along with a bathroom, wardrobe space and mini bar area. Two televisions made everyone happy and a desk space came in handy, when planning excursions and writing about our trip.The décor reminded me of an art deco feel and the rooms were clean, well planned out, if a little dated. I think the price point was great, given the space we had and facilities available in the hotel. On both our visits we enjoyed the Marriot Lounge, which served a good breakfast (including fruit, eggs, cereals, toast and bagels and more), all day drink refreshments, great evening treats and coffee to go! Having Cappuccino’s and water bottles available each day before we enjoyed the tourist sites was a real treat! The evening service included anything from pasta, mixed salad leaves, cheese plates and fresh made blueberry pie. Often you could feast on the available dishes on offer and not head out in the cold…The Restaurant 525 Lex, was fantastic with a delicious array of hotel favourites. Burgers, Mac and Cheese and a full bar were only part of what the restaurant offered, but it served us well before an early flight the next day. The staff were incredible at the hotel. From the moment we arrived and very attentive bellman took our bags, we were swiftly ushered to the Marriott Elite Desk and shown our room within minutes. We were also advised of the M lounge availability, which proved a life-saver to us on this trip. The front desk staff (and Sam in particular) were always happy to see us and most helpful. We were shown our room on our second stay by a fellow that has worked at the hotel 32 year. His knowledge of the hotel and NYC was very impressive! The tour office staff were super helpful in suggesting restaurants that matched our taste and budget and on one occasion, patiently dealt with me on three visits about which best hop-on hop-off bus we should take, given our limited time frame and desire to keep costs down. Peter (the tour desk staff) had the patience of a saint!Housekeeping were very good at the hotel and always ensured we had fresh towels and our rooms were cleaned well. On one occasion, we required more toiletries and the lady (who was deaf) was very obliging and accommodating. The location of this hotel was ideal.

I had meetings near Grand Central and have grown tired of Times Square so I chose the Marriott East Side for my one night stay. I was upgraded to a ""superior"" room which was a nice size and plenty comfortable ( I am gold on the Marriott program, FYI). The furnishings are fine if maybe a little on the older side; there was a wooden box covering what appeared to be a 100 year old air conditioning unit, but the temperature control in the room was fine. Bed was crazy comfortable. A couple of quibbles - it took a very long time for the water to get hot in both the sink and shower but eventually it got plenty hot. And the shower head was about a foot too low. Elevators are small but efficient- I never had to wait long.The concierge lounge is top notch. The food at dinner time was enough to keep me from having to go out - it was Salisbury steaks in a brown gravy, mac and cheese, and asparagus spears, along with a nice salad. Perfect, as I arrived around 7pm and didn't want to go out. Breakfast also included a bunch of hot dishes along with the usual breads and yogurts. And the lounge is gigantic. Sadly they serve Pepsi products and charge for alcohol, but overall this lounge was way nicer than the one at the JW Marriott I stayed at in DC the week before.Wifi was decent (I had a couple pauses while FaceTimeing but not too bad) and the TV is small but offers Netflix (and maybe Hulu and Crackle if I remember) channels. They have the NFL Network too.

He visits NYC frequently and has great things to say about being a Platinum Elite member and staying here (usually upgraded to a suite, etc. Did not happen this time since we arrived 5 hours late at 1 AM).Our hotel room was the typical standard room - comfy bed and clean. We were on the 21st floor and faced Lexington Ave. We were high enough that traffic noise was not a problem. Other friends had a room on the 4th floor and viewed a wall (as one would expect). The bathroom is small - but the shower was nice and warm and the shower head generated lots of water pressure.The hallways do have some wear and tear - scuff marks on the walls and some worn carpet pulled away from the walls.The reason for the downgrade from 4 to 3.5 for me: the fitness center is under renovation. The normal place is on the 23rd (I think) floor and has a nice view. Instead, it was a basement conference room. Nice cardio equipment but the room was stuffy. The staff was efficient during our encounters. Our key card acted up and security responded very quickly to assist us. The front desk staff was also very helpful. We did not eat or drink at the hotel, so I cannot evaluate (other than bfast in the M Club).I would stay here again.

The water in the shower took a pretty long time (roughly 2-3 minutes) in warm up.2. the mini fridge in the room was hidden in a cabinet that looks like a chest of drawers.

That's just a personal pet peeve of mine is when hotels hide the mini fridge.Aside from those 2 minor annoyances everything else in the room was perfectly acceptable. Rest of Hotel: The rest of the hotel was fantastic for the most part except for 2 things.1. This is just another minor annoyance for me personally. The ice machine on our floor was shooting ice everywhere but into the ice bucket. It was just annoying to deal with.2. There seems to be some mechanical issues with the elevators in this place. I got onto an elevator to go from the floor my room was on to the lobby and it dropped me off on a random floor and wouldn't go down anymore which forced me to wait for a different elevator. also these have to be the slowest elevators ever!!!

Our original reservation was for a 3 night package promotion through the Marriott website. The package (as booked on the website) included NYC Explorer passes for 2 adults to 3 NYC tourist attractions (from a list of 68). When I originally booked I called to ask if the passes were provided for each night we stayed or just once for the whole stay (so 3 passes each for 3 sites vs 1 pass each for 3 sites). After some discussion, the employee I spoke with said we would get a pass for each night of the stay (so access to 9 sites based on 3 nights) . The package advertised included a $15 gift card for breakfast at a local Illy café, a NYC tour book and free internet, This all sounded great as the room rate was also really low ($180 the first night and ~$220 for the next two nights for a King room)... over all a great deal so we booked and were ready to go!Anyhow, after some travel drama on the day of our arrival (our flight was delayed 10 hours), I called to ask if they could secure a late check in and a higher floor room (per recommendations on this site). They were very accommodating and ensured a late check in was fine and that they had upgraded us to a larger room on a high floor.Fast forward to arrival. When we checked in, we were met by very helpful staff who quickly got us our room key. When I inquired about the package they were a bit befuddled b/c they said very few people get that package and the passes were locked in a special safe. They had to get a manager to come help us, which took a little time. When they brought the package it was all in a small clear bag and included 4 NYC Explorer passes (2 adult and 2 child) and was clearly labeled a Family Pack... I asked if that was what they meant to give us (since I had assumed we would just get 2 adult passes per night, as advertised) and showed them my reservation info I had printed off the Marriott Website at the time I reserved the package. They were definitely perplexed and said they had never seen the package outlined that way. They even asked for a copy of it to discuss with Sr Management. I decided it wasn't worth arguing (it was already 10pm). So we took the materials provided and they said they would substitute access to the M Club for the Illy gift certificates each night. That worked out just fine b/c the breakfast there is decent and they also provided drinks and snacks round the clock. So, while it wasn't what I expected, they did a good job with substitution. What I thought was amazing was we were the first people to get the package (they had a sign in sheet to prove we had secured the passes). How does no one else take advantage of this? Make sure to look at all package options on the Marriott website people! It was a great deal. The passes go for $77 each and we got them as part of the room rate!At the time of check in I also asked for another night (so we could actually get 4 days in the city) and there was some confusion about whether we could continue in the same room at the same rate as the last night (a Monday) was well booked. After some back and forth over the next day, they were able to secure the same room for us at a $50 increase (not bad given the going rate was $379 that night and we got it for $279) with access to the M Club continuing. Overall, while there were some snafus around the package, everything was handled graciously by the staff and it worked out.As for the room, it was great. A larger King size corner room on floor 18. Close to the elevator, but we couldn't hear the noise and it still had a view onto Lexington. The room had a small pull out couch and at nice bath. Everything looked like it could do with a bit of refreshing (paint, etc,), but it was clean and bright and spacious. The location of the hotel is perfect for accessing subways, walking to Times Square, the Empire State Building, Central Park and anywhere in between. We used the passes to see the Empire State Building, a night bus tour of lower Manhattan, the Intrepid, and a Shark boat tour on the Hudson. All were great. We actually didn't have time (with our other scheduled activities) to use the remaining 2 tourist sites the pass would have given us. So more passes likely would have been excessive. Just wish I had someone to give the remaining passes to! (they have to be used within 30 days of activation).The M Club had a decent amount of variety at breakfast and the food was always being refreshed. Seats in the M Club were not hard to find and the staff were helpful. We never made it to the appetizer time (5-7), but did get drinks (soda, water, juice, coffee) often and got dessert one night (served 7:30-9:30). There are lots of cute restaurants right nearby and also places to just pick up a slice of pizza or a snack (lots of food carts).The staff (front desk, bell stand, M Club and cleaning staff) were all very friendly and accommodating. My son left his bag in the room at checkout and the cleaning staff was already on their way downstairs to get it when we realized it was missing. The bell stand secured us a car service to the airport and held our bags all day while we were out for no charge. And every time I had a small issue with a key or anything, the people at the desk were very helpful and more than generous.No doubt I will consider the Marriott Eastside for my next trip to NYC. Looking forward to 4 years out when my next child turns 10 and gets to go on his trip to NYC! I give them a 5 for service and a 4 for quality of the rooms. That said if I could give a 4.5 I would!","Rochester, New York","589elizam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rochester, New York</strong>",35,4.0

The plus sides were that the hotel is in an acceptable location (10mins walk to times square) and central station a few minutes away. The rooms are clean and ours was quiet (although this is because it was not street facing and the windows looked into other blacked out windows) - no view at all. The beds were comfortable and the junior suite was handy if you need 3 separate beds (hard to find in hotels in NY which is why we ended here). I cant comment on breakfast as this was not included. There was a TV in both rooms and they had good channel selection. A few aspects were disappointing though and left us likely to look for another hotel next visit. I imagine NYC hotels can get away with whatever they want being in demand all the time, but a few things were irritating when you pay good money to stay here. We stayed in a suite which cost a fair sum. After you get out of the small elevators, we found our room was dated. Whilst I appreciate its hard to renovate these old places in NYC, i think 4 stars might be a bit generous. The room (which was tidy) is smaller than pics imply but still acceptable with bags on the floor (i did not see any case stands). Strangely the basin is not in the bathroom and so you brush your teeth on carpeted floors outside the bathroom. The shower head is set for someone 5 foot 9 or less. Wifi is not included in room cost. The service was disappointing. We asked for linen on the first night and after 40 minutes rang to ask if we could please have it as no one had come. The reply was that ""I had already told someone"". Not really an acceptable reply, please just bring the sheets! The doormen did not open or greet at any time during several days, barring when we left and came down with our bags needing a cab (hence a tip). There were 1 or 2 nice folk at the concierge who helpfully advised us to get washing done elsewhere when asked (i.e. it costs $6 to get one pair of socks washed in the hotel). I was also frustrated to have to pay the minimum $5 fee to print one concert ticket in the business centre.

We didn't have to worry about anything. Immediately upon arrival, we were checked in (even early no problem), were upgraded to a room with a great view and were treated with the utmost care. I am a Marriott Rewards member and not sure if that is the reason but definitely we were surprised on the upside with the hospitality. I have come to appreciate Marriott as a hotel even more recently. I now live abroad in the Netherlands and we travel quite a bit. When in doubt, I make sure we stay at a Marriott. We have not been disappointed...always consistent. With our room at Marriott East Side, it was truly perfect for what we needed. I can't say much for all the amenities because we ate out and didn't spend every moment at the hotel, as you would expect visiting New York. When we were there, it was perfect in every way. Rooms are spacious, clean and have a nice decor (very Marriott). I have stayed at hotels often in New York and I would not hesitate to stay here again nor recommending it to others.

It feels more like a neighborhood apartment building than a hotel, and that's a good thing.Check-inThis couldn't have been a nicer experience. My compliments to Collette and Denise at reception. They were beams of sunshine! The process was smooth and I was in my room in no time.The roomI was fortunate to have a small suite on the 33rd floor and it was very nice. A long foyer, with closet, led to a sitting room. There were french doors leading to the bedroom and the bedroom had its own entrance to the bath (with another door to the foyer). There was also another closet near the bath. The rooms were a nice size in which to relax and not feel cramped after a day in the city. Lighting was good, considering the size of the room, and the light blocking curtains functioned well. It was, generally, very quiet, and I heard no foot traffic.It was nicely appointed, but I'll offer some observations:•the design is dated (for transparency, I am a designer by trade), the color palette, carpeted rooms and furnishings appear from another decade. All, however, were spotlessly clean! But it could use a refresh.•it is an upper level room and the bedroom windows reach from the floor to about 4' high. The sitting area windows are fine. (It has to do with the building's architecture.) I wouldn't trade a nice suite for higher windows, though. Relax and enjoy.The bathroom:A large, well lit bathroom with the usual amenities. There was no tub and the shower was on the smallish side. Not an issue for me, but could be for others. I like that it had a small foyer entrance from the bedroom with a closet. It was practically a dressing room.Water temperature and pressure were good, especially considering an older building and being on the 33rd floor. One issue, but it's rather common, the bath vent shares with the neighboring room and you get to hear a lot of their noises...and they, likely, yours. Just an FYI.Extra notes:-Standard Wifi is an exorbitant $16.95/day, unless you book through Marriott or are a Rewards member. I travel extensively and it still irks me that hotels are still charging for the wifi. It did, however, work well.-Rooms on 33-35 (35 has the fitness center) must be accessed by an additional elevator. Not a big deal, but keep it in mind for timing. During my stay, the additional elevator had a mechanical. I phoned to inform the front desk, but they were already on it, and I just used the stairs to go down one flight to catch the regular elevator. Not worth complaining about to staff, but know your options going in.-The M LoungeThis was a nice perk, with morning breakfast and heavy snacks in the evening. The breakfast was vast and quite nice, with the concierge personally visiting with guests to help them with their day's plans, a nice touch. Evening selections included salads, pasta, cheeseboards, and the like. You could make a light supper of it. It was good, the variety was nice, and the staff, again, very nice and eager to please. One observation, the evening snacks were cleared at 7:30, even though the serving vessels were still full. No one had a chance for seconds and some guests arrived at 7:40, shocked that there was nothing to snack on. It made no sense, with all that food, to shut down so early. I didn't see a posting of serving times, and that may be helpful to guests to plan their evening.The verdict:A nice property, convenient to transportation, food and shopping. A quieter neighborhood feel is very nice, too. Overall, the great staff makes up for any inconveniences.","Laurel, Maryland","MarkWorld</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Laurel, Maryland</strong>",86,4.0

The hotel was nice as you would expect from a typical Marriott but the staff was what really stood out on this trip. I cannot say enough great things about how accommodating everyone was during our stay but the person that stood out the most was the bellman Albert. While assisting my family members to their rooms Albert found out about my mother and the fact we were there to take her to Memorial Sloan hospital. Albert then took it upon himself to make arrangements to upgrade my parents to a suite in which we would all be able to gather with her and visit after a long day of doctor’s appointments. Furthermore he sent some special treats to the room and he even bought a card for my mother and had the staff sign it. He went far above and beyond to make her feel special and to help us make the very best of a sad trip.I am a Platinum Elite member and have always been treated very well at the Marriott properties but this experience was by far the best in regards to how hard the staff worked to make sure we were very comfortable and could make the best of our time together. Everyone was so kind and made sure that my mother felt like a rock star.My mother has that card proudly displayed on a shelf in her home now. It meant so much to her that a stranger(s) could care so much. I can’t thank Albert enough and he has made a lasting impression on all of us. He is a true gem and a huge asset to Marriott. Additionally, the club lounge at this property is one of the best I have ever visited. The selection was excellent at all times of the day and the staff, like in the rest of the hotel, always went out of their way to make sure everyone was taken care of.

However, this trip was booked as a package deal with my airfare, so I don't think they realized we are faithful Marriott customers. We ended up with room 620, which was like a closet. The view outside our window was to a dark, brick wall that went up to about the 8th or 9th floor. So, we had no view, and NO ambient light. Even with the two lights on, the room was dark and dingy. The beds were comfortable, and the room was clean. The upside of the hotel is its location in Midtown Manhattan. It is next to the subway at 51st and Lexington. It also located just close enough that we walked to and from a musical on 44th Street. We enjoyed the M Club amenities, and the gym on the 35th floor was fine. The Concierge, Peter, was the best! He recommended a hilarious musical (""Something Rotten""), and an equally great restaurant. He arranged for our tickets to be delivered to the hotel, and another concierge made our dinner reservations. Manuel, the bell man, arranged for a ride to the airport for us, and the rest of the staff was fine, as always. I'd stay there again, but definitely be pickier about which room I'd accept next time.

I had called down one morning after I left to ask that they could change the shower head or do something to reduce the pressure. After I returned that afternoon, there had been no change, but I ran into one of the maintenance men - he first asked me about my stay in general, and when I told him I had this issue, he helped me out immediately. Although I know he had to be busy, he took that time for me on the spot and even refused to take a gratuity. I didn't get his name but I did mention this to one of the supervisors right after this happened but for those else that may be reading this from the hotel, I wanted you to know as well.Rooms were clean and comfortable, and it was convenient to have the concierge lounge open throughout the day even if only to stop in for a water or soda or snacks. The concierge lounge seemed stocked with more stuff than you'd normally find during the off hours - plenty of soda selections, granola bars, and even yogurt in the refrigerated area. As one person mentioned, the elevators can be a little slow and temperamental at times, but it wasn't too big of an inconvenience for me.Good sleep quality as well for Manhattan, but as always, it doesn't hurt to have a noise generator to drown out the sirens and horns.Gym was decent with a few treadmills and ellipticals and free weights up to about 60 or so lbs.I had stayed in the Waldorf Astoria two weeks prior.

The bed was very comfy and the room was nice. The TV worked but Netflix and Hulu did not and some channels didn't come in. I called the front desk about this and someone came up but it didn't get fixed. When we moved to the standard king the TV worked, but the room was a little stuffy even with the AC on. In both rooms, there was fridge but it was empty (no minibar). I consider this a huge plus since I like having a fridge that I can put my own low cost drinks and leftover food in. There didn't appear to be room service food which is a bummer for a romantic getaway, but a nice restaurant right next door makes this OK. Overall the price was right for the location and class of hotel. On departure the doorman guided us to a car to take us to LGA for a flat $45 which was much more comfortable than a cab at about the same price.

The light is poor and there is no direct light control on the bedroom side therefore you need to go to the end of the room to switch on a desk light. The heater makes an awful noise when it starts and the windows have very poor isolation so the cold comes in but because of the heater noise you cannot sleep with it. The bad isolation contributes also to a continuous noise from the outside and neighbor rooms. The shower is like most of the ones you can find in NYC hotels thus no control over pressure which in my room was not great but acceptable.

To be honest, and based on some reviews I expected a rather run-down room. On the contrary, we were accommodated into a nice double room with comfortable king bed, rather small but complete bathroom, big TV (including netflix), coffee-machine and small fridge (not minibar). It is true, however, that the desk corners and the bathroom door are a little bit chipped, but nothing serious). Everything was clean.The lobby is renovated and has free wifi (not in rooms). Location is central, 3 blocks from 5th ave. near Waldorf Astoria, easy to walk back from Broadway at night, metro is 2 blocks away and buses run along Lexington Ave. We even took the Airtrain from JFK and it proved OK!There is a restaurant on site (which we didn't try), other dining options nearby and a deli market just across the street.Service was outstanding especially one night when I called the lobby asking for a bottle opener. I explaned that it was my birthday and I wanted to enjoy a Brooklyn beer before going to bed. A few minutes after my call, I received not only the bottle opener but also a lovely tray with champagne, an excellent fruit plate and a nice birthday card from all the staff on duty. I couldn't believe it!!

I have always been able to check a bag and a few suits with the bell staff on weekends instead of having to travel with them at every Marriott property I stayed at in the past (usually (forty + weeks annually around the U.S.) but this bell staff is terrible and made it clear that I was not to bother them with this even though they were tipped generously! They are some of the most unhappy and unprofessional people I have ever met at a luxury hotel anywhere in the U.S. Thankfully the rest of the staff was fantastic including checking in and breakfast but the first impression I got from the bell staff was they were doing me a favor and I was not welcome on the property as I was putting them out expecting them to do their jobs (possibly because I am from Charleston, SC and have a southern/gullah dialect).

The issue here, however, was the limited bar and restaurant service. Our plan was to grab a night cap at the hotel bar and watch some of the NY Met playoff game. Instead, as we took our seats at the bar at approximately 11:20pm on a Friday night in the city that allegedly never sleeps, the bartender announced last call. We quickly ordered only to find that a serving of Glenlivet cost $22--outrageous even for Manhattan. So I ended this short, expensive outing with a discussion with the bar manager, asking why the early Friday closing? Apparently, it has to do with union issues. That is Marriott's problem, not mine. Seems incredible that union issues would force a major hotel to close its bar at a ridiculously early time on a Friday night--with the home team in the playoffs no less. We stayed in the next night to watch the Saturday night game but to make matters worse, discovered the hotel offers no room service. So, it's an decent choice if you are looking for a comfortable room but not if you expect full service food and drink.

What a shambles these were particularly when you were in a rush to get down. You just could not trust the lifts to come and frequently on the rare occasions when they came more quickly, they were full of suitcases or guests with suitcases. I have seen the management responses to similar comments and quite honestly, it is blatantly apparent that all you will get is platitudes.

I called the hotel prior to our arrival and explained this trip is for a special occasion and asked if we could be upgraded to a nicer room. I explained I and a Marriott rewards gold member but would like to be guaranteed an upgrade as opposed to taking my chances during check in. No promises were made but the lady I spoke to said she would make a note on my reservation. We were assigned a room on the top floor of the hotel and was probably twice the size of any Manhattan hotel room I've stayed at. However after unpacking and settling into the room, I noticed a constant low volume booming noise that wouldn't go away. Turns out, it's the elevator banks and our room was located directly across from the elevators. I knew there was no way I would be able to get any sleep with this noise and we ended up going back to the front desk to request a room away from the elevators and packed everything and moved into a much smaller, but still upgraded room. Everything is within walking distance of the hotel as we were able to walk to Times Square, up 5th Ave to Central Park, and the subway was close by which took us downtown to the 9/11 Memorial and TriBeCa. We did not try the food at the concierge lounge as we stayed over a weekend when it was closed and why would anyone dine at a hotel restaurant when there are thousands of great restaurants in NYC?As others have commented, yes the elevators are small, the elevators are slow, yes the furniture is old, but I must commend the service provided by the valet, the bellman, the cleaning staff, and especially the front desk as they were able to find us a less noisy room and offered to help us pack our things when we needed to move.

The art déco décor is nice especially the woodwork and floors. The only downside to the hotel is the elevators. They are small, noisy and very slow. At checkout time it was maddening trying to get an elevator as only a few people could fit at a time with their luggage. That being said, by far the worse drawback to this hotel is its location. It is not convenient to anything really. It’s not close to Time Square or the Broadway shows. It’s not close to Central Park or the museums. It’s not close to the Empire State Building or the Freedom Tower or the Statue of Liberty. I guess the only thing really kind of close is Rockefeller Center. The hotel is in the middle of everything but not close to anything. It’s a long walk or cab ride anywhere you go. My advice for staying in New York is to pick an area that interests you and stay there. If museums are your thing, stay closer to Central Park. If Broadway shows are your thing, stay closer to Time Square.

The décor is so predictable, are hotel designers restricted to brown and beige? Tea and coffee making facilities are in the room but putting out only a single tea bag seemed a touch mean. Finally, on departure, when we mentioned to the bell hop that we would take a taxi to the Brooklyn cruise terminal he said “oh you’ll struggle to get a cab to take you there – let me organise a limo, only 70 bucks”.

Very much appreciated that there was an empty mini-fridge in the room, that I could store snacks and cool beverages in. Wifi worked pretty well, I had no issues getting work done, including downloading large-ish files. Temperature of room was fine and adjustable. I'm an elite/gold member, so I had access to the M lounge, which was very nice. I went down for evening snacks one night, decent selection, and then breakfast both mornings, which was nice because there was toast, fruit, cereals, and then also a hot food selection. Cooler to the side filled with yogurts, waters, and soft drinks available at all times which was MUCH appreciated. Decent amount of seating.

WE ate at Smith and Wilensky before going to the Lion King at the Minskoff Theatre. The room was clean with the usual Marriott superior bedding. What was obvious was the room decor was very dated. The bathroom was not well designed and had no serious upgrade in many years as it had the old style 6 gallon flush toilet instead of the 3 gallon toilets that became common over 10 years ago. The restaurant in the hotel has a very limited menu with limited desserts as well. I became incensed about this as we wanted to have some nice desserts after returning from the theatre but I had to raise hell before they sent out to another restaurant for some chocolate lava cake. I found out this is a corporate downgrade from Marriott at many of their urban hotels. I have been a loyal Marriott customer for years but I cannot support this policy. Marriott has always had an excellent reputation for their food service and room service.

We don't NEED to stay overnight just to see a Broadway show (and seldom do). We usually ""train-in"" Saturday morning, get our discount TIX (at TKTS),have a nice lunch, enjoy the show and be home before bedtime.We had tickets for a Friday evening performance (""On Your Feet"" - 5-stars BTW) and thought it might be nice to stay over (and take advantage of the Saturday matinee option). Not even realizing it was Columbus Day weekend, I found the hotel prices to be ridiculously high and had resolved to plan on returning home Friday. However, remembering a good experience with Priceline several years ago, I put in a bid for a Four Star Midtown hotel and ""scored"" the Marriott Midtown East.We were quite pleased with the price/value (at least, at the price WE paid). Room was clean, comfortable and a generous size. Staff was pleasant and efficient (and let me know that as a rewards member, I was entitled to the lower tier <which was fine> in-room internet access). For a Broadway weekend, you can hardly do better for location (at 49th and Lexington) - 6 blocks from Grand Central Station - 6 blocks from most of the Broadway shows.BTW: I had SOME concern as our room happened to be right across from the elevator - never heard a peep all night. That said, being in the front of the hotel, we did get SOME street noise (not much, really from the 11th floor) and a constant - moderately annoying - humming noise all night. It seemed to quiet down somewhat in the morning (hmmm?). There is subway project underway nearby and I can only speculate some harmonics from compressors or electrical equipment that may(?) subside during the day. A light sleeper MIGHT have less trouble with a room off-the-street. Last comment: we were able to leave our one overnight bag for ""no charge"" - the completely optional gratuity was well worth the convenience.","West Haven, Connecticut","Jim G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Haven, Connecticut</strong>",59,4.0

I have frequently stayed in Marriott hotels and am an Elite member who's earned many points. This is meant to be a four star hotel but it doesn't come close. It is very tired, poorly maintained but yet it was more expensive than I've ever paid in a Marriott (circa $400 a night) and was the worst experience. Leaving aside the things I can't blame Marriott for - which was that New York was full due to the United Nations which was underway which resulted in much more external noise with sirens going day and night, and a reception area and elevators constantly full of extremely rude Chinese and Japanese guests (Apparently part of the UN event). The double glazing in the hotel is very poor which filtered out very little of the outside noise. The air conditioning units are so noisy you have to choose between being kept awake by them or to have a stuffy room. It was the same in both rooms we stayed in. The lifts were extremely temperamental and clearly need to be replaced. We were told only one floor has been renovated with the others to follow but it's clear they are long overdue for renovation - by about 5 years I'd say! We were initially checked into a room on floor 8 which was dark, very noisy but more importantly not clean! Additionally, the sink plug didn't work so we wasted water to use it at all and there was only one tea bag and 1 paper cup for a room with 2 beds! (they did bring more when asked). See attached photos. We asked to be moved to a higher floor and this took place on day 2. On floor 19 the room was brighter (more daylight) and cleaner. Clearly there are inconsistent standards in cleaning from floor to floor. However it was still very dated - including cheap quality blinds and wood-chip paper on the ceiling!! Really? I wouldn't expect this in a 2 star place. We ate here only once and apart from the wine which was nice, the location has no atmosphere at all, the bar area lacks comfort or warmth, the steak was overcooked and hence tough and the quality didn't match the price ticket. Worst of all was the service. One older grey haired waiter appeared to deem it his duty not to look at any guests, definitely not to smile or speak to guests and always served whilst looking away with a sneer on his face. It seemed there was some kind of dispute between the serving staff and this was causing a very uncomfortable atmosphere. This was so annoying we almost walked out and we noticed other guests also commenting on this. We wouldn't recommend unless you get a renovated room at a reasonable rate on a high floor - and don't eat here.","Leatherhead, United Kingdom","barbaravR8412NN</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leatherhead, United Kingdom</strong>",193,2.0

It was relatively close to our event and to the restaurant we were eating at the night before. We arrived at the hotel in the late afternoon. We had driven to New York so we needed to park. The hotel offered valet parking which was rather expensive, but typical for this part of town. However, when we got the hotel, the entire block in front of the hotel was filled with cars waiting to be parked. We had to drive around the block several times until a space opened up. The valet was busy talking to someone in one of the limos, so we ended up waiting another 5-10 minutes until he decided to come take care of our car. Not the kind of service I expected from this hotel.Check in was fine. We went to our room, and as expected, it was small. The three of us could function reasonably well in the space, but it was not ideal. The room had some work done to it, especially in the bathroom, which was also very small, but clean and nicely appointed. Since we were there overnight, we were going to live out of our bags, but that was a bit of a challenge given the space, as well. The bed was quite comfortable. The air system in the room worked okay, but didn't keep the room a consistent temperature throughout the stay. The next morning, we decided to get breakfast on our way to the event and had to wait too long to get our car back from the valet. I had called down 20 minutes before we were departing, figuring that should be enough time to bring it around, but we had to wait another 15 minutes before it arrived.Overall, our experience was not ideal, but given the options in this section of NYC, this hotel was acceptable.","Providence, Rhode Island","ltt18</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Providence, Rhode Island</strong>",26,3.0

The hotel has a nice lobby and the front staff were friendly - but that's about where the amenities ended for me. The room was smallish by other NY hotel standards. There is NO ROOM SERVICE - not even for coffee. And the in room coffee - they had this box in the room that contained the coffee grounds, sugar, stirrers, three cups, but only TWO little mini-moo creamers. What a joke. I called down one day for more creamer and they guy brought up a bag of 10 - clearly he knew how many it would take! ;-) And the ratio of stirrers to sugar to cups to creamers was different each time.The bathroom had the loudest toilet I've heard in my life. It was like someone killing someone in the bathroom every time I flushed. As a test, I flushed, went out into the hall and with both the bathroom and bedroom doors closed - I could easily hear it filling. The controls for the shower were loose - and considering this was allegedly an assisted living suite for people with physical disabilities - there was no excuse for that. Ironic given it was the 25th anniversary of the American's with Disabilities Act. And I kid you not when I say I slipped in the shower every single time I was in there - the material they add to the bottom of the tub to make it non-skid was all but completely worn smooth. The phone in the room didn't work either (the handset). Again, given it was a room for the disabled, what a miss! I couldn't help but imagine having fallen and the frustration of not even getting the phone to work.

He even spotted us on the street on his off hours and asked how our day was. Truly can't ask for a nicer group of staff. Peter at the concierge desk was a wealth of knowledge. We had a lovely room on a high floor, with a king bed and sitting area. The room size was larger than most, another perk of this hotel. The room was always bright from the three windows with great views of the surrounding skylines. The bedding was like sleeping on a cloud. The bathroom is nicely appointed with a large vanity and includes some lovely bath products. Some reviewers of this location feel the hotel is in need of an upgrade. I found everything to be more than adequate.

Another instance involved asking the concierge about the airport shuttle to Newark. Their response was get a town-car instead for $95 flat fee. However, the cheaper option is to go to 41st and Lexington where there is an airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes (depending on the time of day it is) and is $17... and I suspect that anyone in hospitality who has to get people to an airport should have known this.","Adelaide, Australia","cdflash</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",28,3.0

The staff are courteous if a little distant.On our previous two visits we were given the same room to the front of the building. This time we were in a corner room, which was more spacious but street noise was much louder. There appeared to be deliveries in the early morning on the street below.

We found that the hotel was very easy to get to via subway from JFK; the M, E and 6 trains are nearby. The trip from JFK to the hotel takes about an hour. We checked in a little early and the front desk staff was very pleasant and checked us in very quickly. We were given room 633.The room was very nice, although it had been well-loved and was due for some updates. The king bed was very, very comfortable and the room was clean. The shower head is quite low; I'm 5'10"" and had to stoop a little to rinse the shampoo out of my hair. However, the water pressure and temperature were fantastic after a long day in the heat. The A/C worked very well and we were thankful to be in that cool air when we returned to the room at night. Our window faced other Marriott 6th floor rooms across the alleyway, so all we saw was brick -- no remarkable view -- and it stayed pretty dark in our room most of the day. But the silver lining here was that we experienced no street noise at all.We were happy to find a fridge, coffee maker, safe, hair dryer and iron provided in the room. We didn't utilize the wi-fi due to the high cost. We spent very little time in our room, as we had a long list of things to see and do, and limited time in the city.We didn't visit the dining room at all, so I can't comment on that. The gift shop sells 20oz bottled soft drinks for $4 (!), so stop at the Duane Reed to stock up for less (there are DRs near the hotel, located to the left AND right on Lexington as you exit the hotel lobby).The concierge was more than happy to help us with restaurant recommendations, and was very pleasant as well. The cleaning staff we met in the hallway were so very nice -- we looked forward to speaking to them each morning!The hotel is located practically across the street from the Waldorf-Astoria, and is walking distance to Grand Central and the Chrysler Building. Whatever you're unable to walk to, the subway will surely get you there -- we took no cabs during or trip and found that everything is accessible by subway. Get the $30 unlimited subway ticket and you're all set!For a quick bite nearby, try Schnipper's -- their burgers are really good, and the location is convenient to the hotel.We would stay here again should we ever make it back to NYC -- we had a great time!","Greenville, South Carolina","palmetto29607</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greenville, South Carolina</strong>",3,4.0

Overall the experience was alright but it had some downers which are worth mentioning, especially the last one. The hotel is a chain, a big one, so expect a big hotel ! From my side thats all i wanted for this trip even though i strongly dislike big hotels. But, we only needed a room for a couple hours since we were out at a bday party and flew back very early the next day. I didnt try the wifi, so no comment on that. The price is high, but we got a deal on orbitz so it was bearable. However, it is New York so i dont think they are more expensive than other places - the opposite is probably true. the good: - the location is very good, and taxis are always available - check in was easy and fast - the bed is comfy, good mattress and clean - overall clean room and bathroom - check out was fast as well, actually we zipped through in 10 seconds (room was prepaid) the bad: - the luggage took very long to get to our room, the guy said he had gone to the wrong floor and had to go back down again (so apparently he didnt listen when i told him my room number) - mini bar was empty (which i think is a new policy but very annoying when you just want a bottle of water) - the shower head was extremely low, so i was standing like a question mark in the shower (my height is 6-2) - when you book through a third party you dont collect points... i booked on orbitz (even though the concierge told me i booked on priceline which wasnt true), so no points for me. BEWARE: When we checked out and took the cab back to LGA the driver tried to rip us off majorly. I am not sure if he had a deal with the concierge though, which got me ""slightly upset"". They loaded my luggage into the trunk but took quite long. When i turned around to see where the driver was i saw him handing some dollar bills to the concierge saying: i will be back then. The driver got into the car and i told him we needed to go to LGA. He started driving and said: this is a flat fee of 49 usd plus toll. I told him this was nonesense and so he literally said to me: ok, but then give me 39. I again told him this was out of the question and asked him to turn on the meter which he did. He then drove an extra round on the highway so we ended up with 42 dollars incl tip and toll. So, be aware, i dont know who is helping whom there or if the driver just thinks he can rip off tourists. But know that in the big hotels people think they can just take advantage. In my opinion Marriott should take better care of this, but maybe i just had a bad experience. overall, the hotel is alright for a decent price.","Curitiba, PR","Gunbecks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Curitiba, PR</strong>",11,3.0

With that said, I am a hotel snob. I will be the first to raise my hand at this admission, because it is true. I expect clean rooms, good service, no theft of my items, no attitude, decent food and courteousness. I do not expect for anyone to treat me like some Goddess, but I do expect the things I just mentioned to be taken care of. We are Marriott Gold, for anyone interested. (Proof that when we travel we often stay at Marriotts.) They are not all created equal, but this Marriott definitely is how a Marriott should look and feel. Now, let's get into the trip: First of all, my friend and I had an early flight. Thus, we knew we were subject to not being able to check in at the time after our arrival to the hotel. Lo and behold, these people made it happen and not only did they let us check in 4 hours early, they gave me the room I requested. (I will get more into that later.)So, my friend and I were thrilled that we could rest for a bit, take a shower and get a snack before going out and hitting the town. This hotel is located in Manhattan (midtown) so you are literally next to hundreds of things to do - shopping (Times Square), restaurants, the subway, etc. You are a short cab ride away from many other main attractions as well. We got inside the room and were pleased that the room was very clean, neat and looked good for a non- super modern hotel. I knew 'going in' due to research, that this hotel was not '2015 contemporary', however, it is still quite attractive and fairly well maintained. I did not expect for my surroundings to be quiet all day and night. We were in Midtown for Pete's sake - that is a bustling area. That is like being in the middle of the ocean and then being shocked when you get wet. It is what it is. It did not bother me, and we were there for two weekdays and and an entire weekend. The nosiest times were of course at night, but it only lasted a few hours. To help alleviate this if this is an issue for you, ask for a high floor room. I was on the 20th floor in a corner room - and it helped muffle it a bit and I found the room comfortable and peaceful.When I go to NY, I never want to leave. It seems this hotel was sympathetic to my plight, because they allowed us to do a late check out as well, with no issues. Now, let's move on to other details:The concierge lounge was really good. The only thing that would have made it great is if they had non-pork meat options as well. The staff was DYNAMITE. One young lady (a manager I believe) by the name of Kenda, was absolutely wonderful! She kept asking if we had everything we needed then went as far as to slice lemons for us and place them in cups for our tea and water we were wolfing down on a daily basis in our room! I was floored. We had the exact amount needed to last us that entire weekend. Now that is what I call service. I simply asked her if she had a lemon wedge or two, but instead, she went the extra five miles. The front desk staff was also very nice, and the doormen were funny and engaging. I go to New York often, and I will definitely be staying here again. It is close to my friends' apartments in town and it is close to the places I need to go and so centrally located, more times than not, people knew where I was talking about without me having to give directions.If this hotel had room service, I'd jump through the roof, but other that, everything was truly superb.

I have had to complain on several occasions about smokers in the room adjacent to mine. Not cool. the rooms are noisy, especially if you are anywhere near an elevator. One time they ""gave me an upgrade"" which really wasn't- it was just a room with two queen beds, but that's about the extent of being treated as a Platinum Rewards member as you get here.The Lounge is decent. Large. Food is not bad. Seen better, seen worse. The staff in The Lounge are about average. The elevators are HORRIBLY slow.

Located blocks away from Rockefeller Center, so easy to get around. Even though we arrived at noon and check-in is at 4pm, they had a room ready for us right away, which was very convenient. The room was a double, fairly small, but very clean and smelled fresh. The bathroom was large and we had plenty of towels. The air conditioner was noisy, but worked well. We did not have a view, but that was fine because we were out all day. The building is older, so the elevators are very small and slow, but the lobby is bright and clean and the check-in process went smoothly. We got back to the hotel at 11:30pm and decided to have a drink at the bar, which is located right off the lobby. It is an open area with couches, tables and chairs. We ordered 3 drinks, nothing out of the ordinary - a cosmo and two martinis and we asked for shots of ""mini Guiness"" and described to our waiter how it should be made: kahlua on the bottom with a float of Baileys on top. Well,the bartender mixed the Kahlua and Baileys together in a tumbler and called that a shot. Disappointing. Also, the three drinks and shots cost us $104 (which included an automatic gratuity for the waiter). Note to self: BYOB for the room next time. So when we got back to the room at midnight, my friend went to the bathroom and nearly slipped because it was flooded and water was dripping from the light fixture. We called maintenance and they came pretty quickly. They went up to the room above us to see if the toilet had overflowed, but could not find the problem. Housekeeping came and cleaned up the water and when they pulled out the light fixture, water came pouring out, which could have been quite dangerous. They said they would investigate it after we checked out the next day. At checkout on Sunday, I told the desk what happened and the manager gave us money off our total, which was much appreciated. They were very apologetic for the inconvenience and made good on it.

My room was facing the rear of the property and was very quiet compared to other Manhattan hotels I've stayed in - it's worth requesting.The room itself was very large and quite comfortable. The free in-room coffee was welcome, the ancient bathroom less so. Service levels were high, at least by New York standards. I've been quite surprised by the very brusque manner I've encountered at other hotels (such as the Westin) previously in Manhattan. The Marriott is far better in this regards and it was welcome.Wifi was quick, but at $16.95 a night you would expect it to be! Marriott, please - it's time to move on and drop this ridiculous extra charge.Don't bother with breakfast at $35, either, as it is very poor value for money for what was a disappointing buffet. There are plenty of better options at half the price within an easy walk of the hotel.The final issue I had was with the elevators. To get to the (very basic) gym from the 8th floor meant taking the ancient, groaning elevator to the 16th, changing to go to the 32nd and then changing again to get to the 35th. Each wait could be up to 5 minutes each way....really, 15 minutes to get to the internal gym is out of this world! Time to upgrade, I think. Great view when you finally get up there, to be fair.So!

It is across the street from the famed Waldorf Astoria. There are shops and restaurants just steps from the hotel and it is a 5 minute walk from Grand Central Station. The closest subway stop is on 51st Street & Lexington which is only 2 blocks away. Those who are familiar with Manhattan know that it is a very walkable city. Whenever we visit NYC, this is our favorite place to stay given its lush, comfortable interior, perfect location and safe, central location. We walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Central Park and Grand Central from the hotel. And if you plan to venture further than the midtown area, then a walk to the subway station will get you where you need to go. Those who prefer taxis will find them right outside the hotel. Buses also pass through Lexington Avenue. While the hotel is in a busy, central area, we did not have any problems with street noise. If you are a light sleeper, then ask for a room in a higher floor or a room towards the back of the hotel. Rooms at the Marriott East Side are comfortable but comparatively small compared to other Marriotts that you may find in other cities. This is true of New York City, however. Hotel rooms are generally smaller since space is a premium. So while the rooms may not be as spacious, you can expect the same high quality service and comfort that you will find in other Marriott hotels. I have stayed in this hotel on a business trip, on a couples trip with my husband and also on a vacation with my family of 4 and enjoyed our stay in all of these occasions.

Cost needs to be less than $500 a night as well. So after staying at a dozen or so various options I tried the Marriott east side at 49th and Lexington. First the good things, it's convenient to my meetings in midtown and the bellman was a very nice gentleman. The gym was reasonable size. Now my issues....the room and hallways are worn and in need of updating. The towels are thin and appear to have been used for years. The hairdryer in the room was broken as was the ironing board. And the tv's in the gym on the treadmills didn't work. Come on guys...who is managing your attention to detail? For 450 a night before taxes, you were a disappointment. I'm being generous at 3 stars. I'd be willing to bet there are 2 star ""days inn"" hotels that pay more attention to detail. I would put a reasonable rate for the accommodations at about 179, anything more you pay is quite frankly questionable. I'm sure they have specials so if you get a room for that rate it is fair. My Marriott profile says I like high floors, but I was put on the third floor. I guess I need to either improve my status or stay another place next time.

Though I booked the room under my name and requested we not change rooms, (all explained to reservation agent along with my credit card number) the agent had booked the three nights under my husbands name. Hence the check in staff said I could not check in unless I called my husband and got his permission!! I showed the staff that my name and my husband name were on my credit card. They were ""terribly sorry "" in a way that reveals not an iota of concern. I asked to speak to the manager who listened in a professional manner and apparently believed I was not an imposter who wanted to check into a room I myself had reserved but did ask me if I could just have my husband email him his confirmation. I have stayed in lovely, elegant hotels around the world and have never encountered such a strange and inhospitable ""reception "". It was bizarre. To continue the poor hospitality, ,there is no room service but you can order food and go downstairs to pick it up. No thank you . There was only one bedside table which is inexcusable ( I put my glass of water on the floor!!) The lounge in the lobby has the ambiance of a bus station. We waited there for our family to arrive and they were greatly delayed. We each had two cocktails that were watery and poor and asked for some nuts or snack. $108 later we got our check. I am happy and willing to pay for hospitality and graciousness and quality. This was not that in any way.

Our beds were old and uncomfortable, the shower water volume was extremely low and worst of all, the noise level from the street was unbearable.

The first time I experience a marriot was in Shanghai. The JW Marriot there was very nice and full of amenities. No complaints there. It just so happened that we had an incident in the room and my sister's power outlet shorted out and shocked her when she was trying to use her curling iron. No harm, no foul, we just went to the front desk to let them know what happened and that my sister may need to seek medical attention. Instead of concern or the usual basic human empathic reaction, one of the girls, Cherry was her name, started laughing. Well my sister had a few choice words for Cherry and needless to say we still tell stories about that trip. Either way on to the experience at hand. I travel to New York for a business trip for Saks fifth avenue in July. I arrive to the hotel promptly. Check in is the smoothest I have ever had it. The room is great but I'm not there to be in the room. When I got back to the room on my last night, the room had a strange, smoky odor. Quite frankly it smelled like weed but I had left the window open and maybe there were smokers across or below me. The trip ends and I go to collect my things and check out. I look high and low and realize that I'm missing my ID and an envelope of cash. I gather my things and head down to let the front desk know that I'm missing some items. I go ahead and tell the front desk woman. I told her that I couldn't find the items and that I hope they didn't get picked up by mistake or in the cleaning of my room. She went and grabbed her manager who went and grabbed a cop that I assumed worked at the hotel specifically.So let me break this down. I am a 27 year old, American born Asian dude. The cop started talking to me like I was an infant who did not speak English. He opened the conversation with ""Well our staff would never steal anything so..."" and ""Our housekeepers are UNION. They would NEVER do that."" Imagine him saying it in slow motion because he thinks I'm retarded. I blinked a couple times out of incredulity and responded with a fairly tame response of ""ok, well I'm not accusing anybody of intentional theft. I simply would like a reference point and to report the incident in case it is the case""I later found the envelope. It had slipped under my suit case's bottom board. A complete accident. No harm at all. However, I don't care if I look like a foreigner or not.

The guest rooms look like they have been recently updated. Rooms & bathrooms are crazy clean. Bed is comfortable, AC is adequate. Nicely appointed & pretty standard for a Marriott business hotel (seemingly better, though, than a New York hotel). We are platinum with Marriott & asked for an upgrade when we checked in. We were with a conference & had their rate. The room we got was very small with a tiny bathroom. We requested a change & got a larger room and larger bathroom the next night. Both were nice & clean.

It had a low, popcorn ceiling and 2 small windows...one of which I discovered looked straight into someone else's bathroom if their lights were on and the door was open at night!

Then to my shock, surprise and inconvenience, they have discontinued room service. Can you imagine any hotel in New York City where people may choose to not go out to eat for a myriad of reasons, not being able to pick up the phone and order a quick snack or some substantial meal to be brought to their room. Plus, I picked this hotel through the Marriott reservation site and there was NO notice that there was not room service. OK - so I tried to eat at the restaurant. Guess what???? There is no real restaurant. It is some cluttered area of fake wooden tables adjacent to the bar where on a Sunday night at 6:30 pm, not another person was dining. I guess that was my real warning. Looking at the menu, there were meager selections and nothing of any real interest for a good dining experience. So I did the best thing I could, treated myself to an incredible Filet Mignon at the nearby Smith & Wollensky's. I am certain this was a better choice by far than eating at the Marriott anyway. I have already told this property I will not be staying as a guest on travels to Manhattan in the future.

Cool lobby with interesting travelers. Wonderful breakfast with nice servers, helpful. Comfortable lobby to meet friends in -- etc. Our room was....interesting, and the layout was awkward. We had 2 doubles/queens and there was a dresser with a TV on it that was literally 4.5 inches from the end of the bed. We kept snagging our clothes on the dresser knobs while walking past! There was funky white stuff on the headboard (ew!) and we left a note and tip for the maids each day, and it was NEVER cleaned off. More than this though -- we had serious problems with several staffers. Holiday weekend, lobby bar, Sunday night (Monday being Labor Day) and there are maybe 10 guests drinking. The floor manager decides to close the bar early, and send staff home! We sat there for another half hour while guest after guest came in for a drink...and we had to keep say, nope, it closed early! Crazy. Guess she wanted to get home. We asked the 2 check-in clerks where the closest corner shoppe was so we could get a bottle of wine for our room, and they were horrible, snotty and not helpful at all! Awful experience, so bad, we actually met with the GM the next day and he took our comments super seriously. We also had the clerk at the breakfast bar (what is the bar at night) tell us the auto tip (when signing coffee to your room) didn't go to him, but to the daytime bar staff! So we gave him an extra cash tip, and then found this out to be false! That's stealing. Leaves a bad taste. I trust, however, that the GM of this property is doing all he can to make it right.

The shower should also consider having a powerful geyser (though the one provided was ok on hot water). The lifts are noisy, slow and takes a long time to come up. It certainly needs upgrade. The check-out was quick and efficient. The hotel does not have room service (which is a shame); however, they suggested calling seamless.com to order food. I should say this was a great idea.I could choose from wide variety of restaurants and the delivery was to the room. Overall, I would consider this a functional business hotel A bit better than courtyard but certainly not to marriott's standard.","Hong Kong, China","AjayJM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",72,3.0

It was clean and updated. The concierge room was excellent Thursday night for apps and a glass of wine, and breakfast Friday morning was, too. Unfortunately, the lounge closes at 2 pm Friday and doesn't reopen until Sunday evening. The bell staff was friendly and efficient. The concierge is a chatty Cathy and I grew quite frustrated waiting to ask her a question while she spent a good 30 minutes talking to women who had just flown in from California. I saw the same women at concierge desk again the next day and the conversation was just as long, and again, while another guest was waiting to speak to her.

Otherwise, a Courtyard would do just fine for a lot less. The Marriott East Side fell right in between. First, I did indeed get upgraded. I have stayed here before and had a very small room. I was upgraded here to a corner room on the 26th floor easily twice the size of my last room with a separate sitting area and plenty of space. Nicely appointed bathroom, updated fixtures, the room was great.First change was that my status entitles me to Concierge Lounge access. As with many Marriotts, it was closed for the weekend. Normally, I get breakfast coupons to the restaurant in this situation. Here, they gave me an extra 1000 pts. Since the breakfast in the hotel was $34 that was not a good trade off. There are good options in the area, but it took me 40 mins to run around in the rain and get something to eat and some coffee at a reasonable price. Second, was there is no Room Service. You can place an order at the restaurant and go down and pick it up yourself. Annoying, but not a big deal. What made no sense to me though was the 15% gratuity automatically added to the check. I was the one running up and down the elevator to fetch my food. What am I tipping for? There was no service. I mentioned this at check out and the clerk seemed quite surprised and said she would mention it to management. New York City is expensive, I get that. But there are some things going on here which don't feel right. Certainly tipping for no service feels like Marriott asking you to pay their employees so they don't have to. Include it the rate and be up front about it, that is nonsense. All that said, Hotel is in a great location, well staffed, with doormen and a concierge desk, very walkable to Grand Central, Times Square and the Theatre District. Rockefeller Center is a few blocks away, the Waldorf Astoria across the street.

I only stay here when my preferred hotels in Midtown are full. This hotel's only redeeming factor is location. For business, you are in the heart of Midtown. For tourism, it's a reasonably short walk to the Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Bloomingdales, Grand Central Station, and more. But location is the only thing this hotel offers. The building is old, tired, and rundown. The elevators are small and cramped, and don't stop at every floor. To get to the fitness center, for example, you take an elevator to the 32nd floor, then take another elevator the 35th floor, then walk up stairs to the gym. Although the lobby has been recently redone (and nicely redone), the rooms and hallways are small. Each of the 3-4 times I've been here this year, my room has had been musty. Only a few rooms have any view, most look out at an nearby office buildings or into an ugly interior courtyard/rooftop. There are not enough power outlets in the rooms. There is no room service; you have to eat in the hotel restaurant in the lobby. What prompted me to write this review was a recent stay where I discovered (in the morning) that my bathroom had not been cleaned from the last guest. When I pulled back the shower curtain to turn on the water, I found a dry and crusty washcloth in the bathtub, along with hair and soap scum. Gross, and that means no shower today. The staff was apologetic when I called to tell them of the problem, but there was nothing they could do.If you are wanting to be loyal to Marriott but need to be in Midtown, stay at the Hotel 57 (at 57th and Lex, a Renaissance property). If you want to be in the Midtown area, stay at the Marriott Marquis (in Times Square). And if you aren't worried about loyalty programs, stay at the Washington Jefferson on 51st. Also, be aware having prefered status with Marriott doesn't matter to the staff. I've never been upgraded here, where the Hotel 57 down the street moves me up 2 and sometimes 3 levels of room any time I stay.

I'd stayed here once before this most recent stay, in February this year, and was a little unhapy about my stay because at first Marriot had screwed up my Gold Card membership and the hotel did not give me its benefits. When this was straightened out I had already missed the chance to get a room upgrade which comes on check-in. (This was not really this hotel's fault because the Central Marriott office had accidentally removed my Gold Card membership; the next day I was able to reach them and get it reinstated). That stay eary this year ended up being ok though, adequate, despite its bumpy start. The Marriott Club Executive lounge (which members have access to) at that time was very crowded, in fact completely full in the morning for breakfast and as such was rather uncomfortable.When I stayed here again in September (2014) I had a much better experience. It looks to me like an entirely new, or newly remodeled at least, executive lounge with much more space, better breakfast and overall a much nicer place to spend time. (The lounge is not open weekends, except for Sunday evening). The hotel room itself was comfortable, in fact quite nice for the reasonable price I paid (for a Manhattan hotel room). (I tried expending my stay online to include weekdays but the price was double for these, due I think the the UN General Assembly taking place then). Also I was not able to get a late checkout, which normally Gold Card members have no trouble getting, because the hotel said these were not available due to the UN General Assembly meeting. Still this stay was a good one.The hotel is conveniently located in Midtown, a few minutes from Grand Central and its many transportation options.My only complaint on this last stay was that after I arrived at the hotel, sometime after 11PM on a Friday as I recall, the fire alarm in my section of the hotel kept going off, to be followed by an announcement that there was not actually a fire. This happened about three times before it finally stopped. As I had just arrived it wasn't a big deal, but for anyone trying to sleep before this time it would have been unfortunate.I will look to stay here again potentially on my next trip to Manhattan. I rate the hotel only ""average"" because of the whole set of experiences I've had, but I'm optimistic that in the future I will be able to rate it above average if some of the quirky less positive things don't happen again.","New York City, New York","8tomm8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",51,3.0

My wife and I stay at Marriotts because they have been consistently good and as Elite members we have been very satisfied with the service. We made reservations for one night so we could check on our son. After our night we decided to use our Marriott points to stay another night. So after a two night stay my feelings about the hotel are somewhat mixed. First, everyone I met working there was very competent, pleasant, and helpful. We were able to stay in the same room for the second night on our points even though it had to be booked as two separate stays. The hotel itself is older and could use some freshening; however, the king room we had was spotless, the bathroom in great shape, the water hot, and the air conditioner kept the place fresh. All this was great and typical Marriott. On the other side of things, no free WiFi is a downer. The valet parker had an issue getting our car returned to us, saying the battery was dead and they had to jump it. Now, apparently when the valet parker parked the car, the left rear door was left ajar and the interior lights drained out the battery. The reason I suspect this is that the door ajar light was on when I got my car and the left rear door was not closed completely and this was the door the bellman opened to retrieve our suitcase when we arrived. Someone should have noticed the interior lights remaining on after the car was parked, not to mention the door ajar idiot light on the dash. I also want to mention the $28 and $32 breakfast buffet. Ok, it's Manhattan and I go there often, but seriously, howabout putting something other than a buffet on the menu. I will pay $15 for two eggs, some bread and a coffee, but thirty bucks is a bit steep for light eaters. Finally, and this is not the fault of Marriott, Lexington is noisy. Get a room off the street if you can and high. I will still give the place 4 stars: however, when I return to NYC I will stay at another Marriott.",USA,"freods</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>USA</strong>",120,4.0

I got a text while I was en route to NYC letting me know my room was available, well before the standard 3 pm check in time. Our room was on the 16th floor and was somewhat interior, facing a ally, but what we lacked in view was made up for by a complete lack of street noise. The room was pretty spacious for a NYC hotel and very comfortable. My only complaint was the bathroom door - it slide closed like a pocket door, but wasn't actually in the door frame, but in front of it. This meant there was a 6 inch or so gap on both sides of the door allowing for no real privacy when in the bathroom. The M2 Concierge lounge was by far the best stocked and nicest I've experienced in my Marriott travels. Complete with an espresso machine that actually made great lattes and a really nice selection of food at both breakfast and happy hour. The fitness center was OK - it was small, and quite packed, but did have a good number cardio machines and a variety of free weights and machines. Finally, another note about the staff - my friend left an iPod and iPad in the end table drawer and she got a phone call from the staff within an hour of us checking out that they had found the items and were holding them. Luckily we were still in the city and able to get back over and when we did we found that they had them already packaged in a shipping envelope, just in case we couldn't make it back.

Subway via grand central station is just blocks away. Hotel staff are friendly however frequent stayers will start to see issues. There is NO Room service available and the resturant that does serve food will not bring it to you. This is very frustrating when you want to work from your room. Printing a simple document is a hassle as you must first pay for use of their computers to SEE if your email or documents have arrived. To make matters worse you cannot get free wifi in the room where you have to print, and of course you have to pay to print. Be sure and stay off the lower floors on the south side of hotel. They dump the garbage at 4 am and it can get noisy.

However, the Wifi in my room did not work and despite nearly an hour on the phone to technical support never did.The bar area and restaurant do not serve food at the weekend it would seem. This isn't really a problem in New York I guess as you will always be able to find somewhere for that, but just struck me as a little bit odd.The hotel is excellently located to walk to most areas of tourist Manhattan and has a convenient Metro very close by. However, be warned that there seems to be a street market on a Sunday that closes off Lexington meaning you will have to walk somewhere pre-arranged with your luggage to get a taxi/car to the airport if you are travelling on a Sunday.On both stays at this hotel I have left my luggage with the bell boy and on both occasions bags have become separated and lost meaning I've had to go hunting through storage rooms with them to find my bags.","Fleet, United Kingdom","iRyan81</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fleet, United Kingdom</strong>",4,3.0

The convenience is marginal (you still have to get to the Subway and all attractions) and the mass of humanity makes you favor side doors anyway. For less money and more sidewalk space, avoid Times Square.The New York Marriott East Side is very comfortable. We were in a corner room with two doubles (though, sharing one bed, they were comfortable for two average-sized people). The room was large. The bathroom was very clean.

What makes our stay unusual is that we stayed in 2 different suites. The first suite was on the 4th floor. Clean, 2 double beds and not as noisy as you would think being close to the street. The room is small, but overall, it was enough for our group of three. I did not feel that the hotel was tired looking. Obvious updates were made in the rooms...newer bathroom fixtures...has more of a contemporary feel. It was nice to be able to control the thermostat. It was sweltering in NYC during this period so it was a nice feature to walk into a cool room and adjust it once we were comfortable. The location is perfect for those who want to walk. Close enough to get to Times Square....Macy's...Grand Central within minutes. Only minor issue we encountered was a burnt out light bulb in our suite entrance way which was fixed by the time we returned from seeing a show. Can't speak about the lounge as we ate out for all of our meals. We also stayed an unexpected 1 night on the 14th floor due to our flight being cancelled. This suite was in the exact location of our earlier one...just 10 floors higher. There were subtle differences...taps were different in the bathroom, a small alcove which was convenient for toiletries was not in the 14th floor bathroom and the suite just seemed slightly smaller. We also waited longer for the elevator to arrive so I prefer a lower floor for that reason alone. I would recommend this hotel for its comfort and proximity to all the points of interest in this amazing city. As a tourist who has stayed in several different hotels in NYC, the East Side Marriott falls into the will stay here again category.","Toronto, Canada","SerenityNow_10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",24,4.0

I originally rated it two stars, now down-graded to one star. (You can't give less.) While I'll stay at other Marriott properties (and, indeed, have two upcoming Marriott reservations), I'm done with the East Side Marriott.I've stayed here before and I chose it again because it was convenient for my meetings.My first room was 2121. A small king, though adequate in size. I switched the next day because the internet did not work. Wired did not work (and wire was broken and had to be replaced.) Wireless did not work. While the hotel made an adjustment, I'd rather pay the bill and not have a problem. And not spend an hour in a failed attempt to get wired or wireless to work. For $325 a night, internet needs to work on the first try. (That included 34 minutes on the phone with the 3rd party tech, multiple calls with the manager on duty at the hotel, and a visit from the staffer who brought the new wire and observed failed connection attempt after failed connection attempt.)I moved to room 2311 for 2 nights. A large, corner room. The internet worked seamlessly on the first day. Second day, hard-wired kept trying to connect me to the Marriott conference internet some 24 floors away. Wireless would not connect at all. (Manager visited, saw the problem, and posted some bonus points.) Wireless worked after a while. Then crashed. I gave up. (I checked out a day early.) Large rooftop air conditioner outside ran continuously at a low hum.There is a large exercise room, but it is 2-3 elevators away. The executive lounge is not open after Friday at about 1:30 p.m. until Monday morning. The hotel provides 1,000 Marriott points in its place. Breakfast at the hotel is expensive, but there are plenty of nearby options.Hotel is convenient to transportation (subway is two blocks) and there are always taxis.UPDATE: As stated above, the hotel promises 1,000 points per weekend day instead of the Executive Lounge. Totally inadequate and totally undisclosed. (Signs were not visible when I went for Friday breakfast, probably due to crowd from adjacent function.) After I checked out, other points from my stay (including applicable bonus points) were promptly posted. The 2,000 points for the closed lounge? Not posted. Called Marriott Rewards. They only post what the hotel tells them to post. Called hotel. First call not returned. Second call both accounting and the manager on duty insisted this was a Marriott Rewards issue. (Over 11 minutes on the phone.) Called Marriott Rewards again. At least they took ownership of the problem and solved it. Over 28 minutes on the phone, most of which on hold so I could do other things. My sense was that Marriott Rewards called the hotel. Whether that worked, or they just decided to post an additional 2,000 points, I do not know.There are plenty of choices in New York, including other Marriott choices. This was my 5th Marriott in about 3 weeks. It was clearly inferior to each of the other 4.","Te Anau, New Zealand","SoCalTraveler91356</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Te Anau, New Zealand</strong>",131,1.0

It seems they just reopened it after updating and is very nice. Almost feels like you are going into an upscale restaurant. I got a plus one pass with my stay so I could have taken someone else with me. Overheard the lady saying to another guest that the first additional person is free and then it is 25.00 for each person after that.

So, without fail, each year we pack our bags,board a plane, and arrive at Laguardia for a fun filled long weekend.There is no doubt....we may stay at different hotels throughout the city, but it will ALWAYS be in Manhattan, and it will ALWAYS be a Marriott property.This year, we chose the Marriott East Side, and there were no regrets.The property is centrally located and easily reached from the airport (well...as easily as can be in a city that size with the traffic flows experienced each day!). The lobby is impressive as you enter, and the checkin experience was great. The staff was efficient beyond belief, and even though we arrived long before check in was scheduled, a room rapidly became available and within a few minutes we were in our rooms. And a few minutes is all you want to be in the room on your first day when there is so much to see and do.We had a corner room with 2 double beds. It was spacious, exceptionally fresh & clean, and had a great view of the adjacent Waldorf Astoria. The room was quiet, and we couldn't have asked for better.We stayed five nights, and housekeeping kept things as they should be. I think they are unsung heroes of the hospitality industry, and I for one appreciate what they do. I make it a point to tip daily, and I wish more customers did so.Check out was a breeze, and though we were sad to end our visit to New York, this property made the stay wonderful.

I have not slept in many NYC properties because I usually stay at family or friends' apartments. In this case, I was in the city for one night, needed clothing for a family member's wedding and wanted to be close to large department stores. From that perspective, the hotel's location is unbeatable. Saks Fifth Avenue, Barney's and Bloomingdales are all within 20 minutes' walking distance, along with many shops along Fifth Avenue.In terms of service, the front desk was pleasant and the doorman helpful. Overall, however, I found the hotel's outside curb environment and lobby to be frenetic and impersonal. I was not greeted till getting to the front of the registration line to check in. The feng shui of the lobby is off, with people and luggage clumped all over the place. The space needs definition, furniture, and a warmer sense of welcoming. There is also an overly chemical, saccharine smell to the lobby which I found disconcerting and unpleasant.I found the hotel room just passable. It was dark in terms of both light and feeling. There was just one tiny window in the corner. The bathroom was rough around the edges with tired paint cracks in the door and door frame. The room lacked a hair dryer: a staple in 21st century hotel bathrooms.Summary: Location is great for shopping and not far from 42nd street theatre. Room clean. Service available, nice but lacking in personal attention. The hotel does not offer a sense of character or feeling for this wondrous American city of New York. If you want a feel for this city, stay elsewhere. In addition, I'd say my room and the overall experience were sub-par for Marriott properties.

Since we had to wait over 3 hours for the second room to be ready, we asked if there was anything Customer Service could do for us to make up for it.. When we got back from dinner, there was champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in both rooms with a personalized note from Neeraj, the man that was helping us.

The smell was strongest in the lobby, but also in the hallways. Lucky for us, it wasn't evident in our room, which we were grateful for. For such an expensive hotel, we were expecting more. We had four garments laundered and the bill came to US$70 which we found just ridiculous - especially as this was not even dry cleaning. There were just little things missing in our room like a shower cap in the bathroom and a pen with the notepad. We also found the payment of our bills confusing. They had our credit card on file and had up to $250 pending for our stay there. We left over a week ago, and they still haven't returned some of our money. So over all, we were not happy with the hotel. Not for the price we paid. The location is excellent though, however we were there during the visit of the President of the United States and as he stayed over the road at the Waldorf, we were often blocked off from the hotel having to walk an extra two blocks to get to the hotel.

But for the price that we paid for this Marriott we expected much much more. Marriott hotels are usually nice and clean with friendly staff. Well, not this one. As soon as we walked into the lobby of the hotel it smelled terrible, disgusting and overpowering! It was one of the most repulsive and revolting smells ever! The bellman informed us that it was the sewage smell because it had been raining so much it was overflowing. That should be enough of a reason for me to never recommend this hotel right? Nope…there is more. Imagine smelling that your whole stay in this overpriced “luxury” hotel. When we went to the front desk the two clerks all had attitude problems. They saw me standing there, stared at and looked at me like I was crazy. They we so rude and ill-mannered and knew nothing of customer service. Finally another woman asked if we needed help and checked us in. Our room was not ready (and it was 4:00 which is check-in time) so we had to wait another 3 hours when they said it would be ready in 30 mins. When we got to our room the smell was in the hallway and a little in the room (on the 8th floor). I was so irritated but too tired to try to switch hotels or make a fuss. The carpet was dingy and definitely needed something on my feet to walk on it. Did I mention noisy rooms? Yes it felt like the people in the hallway talking at 6am were sleeping in the bed with you!

I found my room to be plenty large enough, with some nice updates done to the bathroom. The reviews are correct, it is very noisy, but I suspect that's hard to change without some very costly updates. It seems to be a trend for older buildings in NY.

The bathroom is very big and they provide tons of towels every day plus amenities. There is plenty of storage space in the closet and drawers if you plan to stay for long. Big minus is the noisy air condition, but I did not use it and I suppose if I asked they would have fixed it. Another big minus is wifi, but this is general minus in NYC. It is very expensive even though the internet is cheap in the US. I am not saying that Internet is not provided, I am just saying it should either be free or at least cheaper (somewhere around 20$ a day). However they do provide free wifi access in the lobby. Breakfast is not good value for money but there are countless places nearby where breakfast is served. Just one block away there is also a 24/7 supermarket if you need something in the middle of the night (they also sell plug adapters). In terms of location the hotel is close to a lot of things. Underground station is on 51st (less than a minute walk), Grand Central is 5 minutes walk, 5th Avenue is 6 minutes walk, as is Rockefeller Center and Times Square is 15-20 minutes walk. Central Park is about 20 minutes and the Museums about 30. But I would suggest a taxi. Taxis are relatively cheap.

Comfortable bed, and the common areas well kept and the staff what I call typical Marriott (professional and courteous). The location is perfect. We were in town for a 2 night stay, to hear the Munich Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall and generally wander around and relax. The location is great. Very close to Grand Central, Rock Center and surrounding areas. Also quite close to the UN (not that I cared). Very close to a T stop if that is how you want to get around. Cab ride from Penn Station to the hotel is about 10-15 bucks.

We were going to park at a garage, but after inquiring if this Marriott had parking, we took advantage. I'll tell you for the $65.00 charge for the valet parking for 24 hours, you cannot go wrong. Parking is ridiculously expensive at any garage..and don't be fooled..there is always a caveat when you see cheap prices. This deal was excellent. Another plus about the hotel--the location. We needed to get from the hotel, on 49th and Lex over to the West Side--45th between 8th and 9th. It was a great walk--about ten minutes--it would have been less if there weren't so many tourists but since I lived in NYC for many, many years, I've become a very fast walker. If you are planning to visit the city and plan an overnight stay, this location is excellent.Also, the staff was very accommodating. We arrived a bit early and were lucky to get a room when we arrived. There is supposed to be a 30-minute window of time to get your car when you need it--I think we waited less than 10 minutes. Honestly, the staff was very amiable.Now here is where things start to go slightly downhill......we were on the 8th floor and there was a very limited amount of elevators servicing the bottom floors--which was a pain because it seemed forever to get a lift--and when they did stop, they were full--the elevators were extremely small. Next..the room. The room was extremely clean, and the bed was, in the usual Marriott way, very comfortable. The room was on the small side, which is expected for Manhattan, but the bathroom plumbing was so noisy. After flushing the toilet, it made an additional flushing noise for about two additional minutes before stopping. Also, the water from the shower would go from hot to cold to hot to cold......Marriott--surely you can do better for a hotel that you are advertising as ""luxury""...then..there is the issue with the windows. OK..so the building is old and pre-war. Fine. However when you charge upwards of $350.00 a night, the windows should stop the outside noise. Some time during the wee hours of the morning, we were awakened by the screaming of--I would say--a gang of club kids. The noise went on for a long.long time and my beauty sleep was sorely interrupted. Ummm....a 'LUXURY"" hotel has windows that do not allow outside noise to interrupt the sleeping patterns of the hotel's paying guests.The menu for room service was virtually non-existent--unless we were just not supplied with one. I also have to add an extremely daunting issue--for the past 16 years or so, we have been faithful Marriott guests. (you can even read some very favorable reviews I've written on other Marriott hotels). We don't even think about staying at other hotels. However, we had an experience this time around that was the straw that broke the camel's back. My husband inquired as to why he didn't see our rewards points for this stay. He was informed that since we made our arrangements through an on-line discount booking service, we were not eligible for rewards points. He then checked another stay we had elsewhere and the same thing--no rewards points. He called the Marriott Customer Service and was very, very upset with the way the customer service rep spoke to him. Neither of us knew that you cannot get rewards points if you book through a third-party. I'm sure we are not the only people who were not aware of this. As such, if Marriott expects its customers who are in the rewards program, to only book through Marriott, then it is a monopoly of sorts because I never see great deals through the Marriott sites--the better deals are third-party. This prompts me to say ""buh-bye"" to Marriott. Too bad you lost two faithful customers..but we can find another real ""luxury"" hotel in the future. Sad day for me...Thank you for reading and I hope my review was helpful in some way.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","jarona</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",157,2.0

The rooms are small, at least mine was and it was a Classic King room. The room is well appointed. It's an older building so I'm sure that they inherited the current room structure and if it's a historic landmark building, they may have been prevented from reconstructing the rooms. It's in a great area; a few blocks over from Rockefeller Center and blocks away from great department stores: the Flagship Saks 5th Ave., the Flagship Bloomingdales, Bergdorf & Goodman, Barney's, Niketown & Tiffany & Co. It's also close to Grand Central Station. The bed was extremely comfortable. I didn't dine at the hotel but did have breakfast at Café Metro which is a couple of blocks up the street on the corner of 51st St. & Lexington (same side of the street as the hotel). Cafe Metro has several locations in the city and has good food at very affordable prices especially, for NYC. The #6 train stops (Lexington stop) about two blocks from the hotel and it took me about 20 mins. to walk to the hotel from the Penn Station area.

The valet was smooth when we arrived and every time we needed our car. The one challenge is the hefty 30 min required to get the car. When we arrived our room was not ready (it was early, so no big deal). We gave our cell number and went on our way. We also gave our bags to the bell staff. When we came back later, our room was ready. Getting the bags was a challenge. We called down and after a long wait got to the general line (I guess there was no one at the bell station). I asked for my luggage which they confirmed will be sent right up. 45 min later I called again, this time spoke to the bell staff. 10 min later we got our bags. The room itself was standard Marriott fare with a great view. One issue were the windows. They were relatively old and allowed more than a little of the noisy New York street to come in. While I would like to enjoy New York I want my room to be a haven, which it wasn't. The team was mostly top notch and looking to please and help, especially the team manning the entrance starting with the valets as well as the managers constantly looking to assist guests. We enjoyed breakfast in the lounge which was large and well stocked. All in all this hotel is certainly good, the team has a good attitude , but some processes and items need tweaking.

This “four star” hotel pride themselves as a “luxury” hotel. Unfortunately, I did not have a luxury experience. After traveling for 11 hours I arrived at the hotel several hours before check-in and asked if it was possible to check-in early given that I have reservations. I was told all of the (629) rooms were booked and that I may want to contact the Wyndham Hotel or Fairfield Inn Times Square. I returned to the hotel later that afternoon and was placed in a double occupancy room with NO sunlight, views of brick buildings and water stains on the ceiling. I asked to move to another room – the second room had a view of a wall and minimal sun exposure. This room had a chain of issues that included water marks on the ceiling in the bathtub/shower, running toilet and clogged drain in the bathtub. Taking a shower was like swimming in a pool due to the poor drainage. Maintenance came to the room to “fix” the clogged drain. Maintenance later voiced that he contacted housekeeping to clean the bathtub after he unclogged the drain. After waiting for 30 minutes we contacted the front desk and asked what time housekeeping would arrive to clean the bathtub/bathroom. We were told that housekeeping was on their way. Thirty minutes later we called the front desk AGAIN to report that housekeeping had not arrived and that we wanted to retire for the day as it was 1am. We spoke with the hotel manager “Neeraj” and expressed our dissatisfaction with customer service and the hotel guest experience that started from when we attempted to check-in early. “Neeraj” apologized (as expected) and offered to provide 100 Marriott Rewards Points to compensate for the inconvenience. (Are you kidding me!? After this experience why would I want to stay at a Marriott hotel?) “Neeraj” did not offer a room change or upgrade or a reduction on the hotel bill. Housekeeping finally arrived 10 minutes after speaking with “Neeraj.”My stay at the New York Marriott East Side was HORRIBLE. I WOULD NOT recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC. Given the volume of hotels in the area and the city one would think that the Marriott is aware of the fierce competition and would appreciate their guests. I previously stayed at The Benjamin (a half a block from the New York Marriott East Side) and the W Times Square – both provided first-rate customer service. Denise, JC and John (?? bald guy) were the only hotel representatives that I interfaced with at Marriott who were helpful.","Washington, DC","Y_KingWashington_DC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, DC</strong>",4,2.0

Most major Manhattan destinations are walkable, plus the 4 and 6 subway trains run along Lexington and are only a few blocks away. Grand Central station is also only a reasonable walk away. The tourist crowds in this area of town aren't an issue. The hotel, and my room, appear to be clean. The staff was reasonably pleasant enough. The Lounge was probably my favorite part (for Marriott Rewards members only). The East Side had more food options than other lounges across the country and the food was quite good. On one night, I found it good enough to not even seek dinner afterwards. As is the standard, all drinks (non-alcoholic) are free and a computer is provided for guest access in the lounge.I utilized the gym, which is on the 35th floor and does have very nice views of the city. The facility is very small but has the basics - treadmills, bikes, a few machines, and a small weight rack. It's below average, but it will suffice. If you're hotel room is below room 16, you have to transfer evelvators twice to get there (1-16, 16-32, 32 to 35).The room itself was pretty standard, although definitly on the small side. The room I was provided had two windows, but had zero view. They looked out onto the roof/brick walls/other windows. The windows also had bars covering them, which is never a pleasant feature. I typically expect to be placed a better room than that given my long-time Platinum status.","San Francisco, California","bretts11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",43,3.0

Fitness center was an adventure to find, but well equipped. It's just that if I wanted to stay at a non-full service property, I would have booked somewhere else.

This was not the case at the East Side Marriott where I recently stayed.The disappointment for me was the concierge service upstairs-I believe the 16th floor. The evening cocktail offered Scampi or Samosas, along with cheese and stale broken water crackers. I do not eat seafood or samosas,which in my opinion are specialty dishes, so i had to go outside to the local deli and get some food. You would think a chain like the Marriott would offer something that has broader appeal such as your basic chicken or beef. That has always been the case at almost all of the Marriott chain hotels that I have stayed at where they offer a huge variety and choices, you can just about have a full meal.An even worse experience was breakfast the next morning.Along with eggs and toast etc, they served various pastries. I took a bite into the danish-it was rock hard, must have been 3 days old.I opted for a different kind of pastry, and that was also rock hard, I figured I would try my luck for the third time but the same result.  How does a chain like the Marriott, especially in NYC, have the nerve to serve stale food? The food that was dished up to me at this Marriott was positively the worst I have ever experienced.They will tell you that they will be opening a new concierge lounge soon. That is terrific to hear,but is no excuse for the poor and stale food choices offered at the existing concierge - you still have guests using and paying for the current concierge.If having a concierge service is important, as it is to me,I would avoid this Marriott unless they clean up their act.There are many hotels in the same neighborhood that probably offer a better concierge, - anything has to be better than what was dished up to me at that concierge.On a positive note, the room was fine, clean and comfortable.",USA,"Ken L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>USA</strong>",107,3.0

This last time, last week, when I checked in, the man at the Elite desk thanked me for my loyalty in being a Gold member and said he had a nice room with a King sized bed for me. I found myself in a tiny room with a window that faced directly onto a brick wall so that in the middle of the day, the room was pitch dark and needed to have the light on just so I could find the bed. The chair was parked in the corner between the wall and the TV (the only place it would fit) and it had no lamp by it (I guess because there was no room for it) and since the overhead light was so dim, the chair was unusable for reading. The service cart was parked in front of my room all day so I had to walk around that in a narrow corridor just to get into my room. This room cost me approximately $400 per night. My team leader picks this hotel not only because he is a loyal Marriott guest and because of its location, but also because he finds the executive lounge a useful place for his team to debrief at the end of business meetings and to talk during breakfast. Too bad the executive lounge was closed and locked Friday afternoon and Saturday when we were there. The service at the bar was terrible - when the waiter at the bar did not deliver my glass of wine 20 minutes after I had ordered it, I went up to the bar and got it directly from the bartender and then the waiter got irritated at me that I had done that! And the bar was not even crowded.

The elevators can be pretty slow, I am pretty sure I have waited over 5 minutes in the morning for the lift to arrive-- not a huge deal, but an annoyance. Additionally, the hotel bar is severely overpriced. They charge a mandatory 18% gratuity on everything and the price of the drink boarder on absurdity.

The hotel otherwise was not very busy for the MLK weekend.They put my brother in a room for 2 nights though I kept saying on Sunday we had reserved two rooms for one night. Twenty minutes of various phone calls to reserv. and front desk still did not resolve this. On check out, they were charging us for an extra night: more time spent to resolve this issue.Also, no breakfast for elite members on wknd, and the lounge once opened on Monday was barren (from 9-10 AM) of many of the items (empty platters, no bacon, sausage, cheeses etc.)Overall, the new lobby bar was great, as is their location, location, location. Rooms are small, facing walls, and overpriced even for MLK weekend in NYC, my home town.","alpharetta, Georgia","cath049</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>alpharetta, Georgia</strong>",39,2.0

The rooms, of course, were small (it is NYC after all), but they had everything I hope for in a good hotel: a comfortable bed, a great bathroom stocked with nice toiletries, a safe and a refrigerator. Because it was the holidays, one evening, they have held a small guest reception where they greeted us with wine, Baileys and Christmas snacks. This wasn't advertised, it was just something they ""like to do a few times during the holidays."" Well, if that wasn't enough, I have to say, what really made me love this hotel was what happened when I arrived home without my jeans. I called to find out if they had them, knowing that I would get them back if they were there. I got that, but I also got great communications on my issue from a very nice man named Bill. Bill is their Loss Prevention Officer. I could tell by my conversation with him that he loves his job and takes a lot of pride in what he does.

To our surprise, she had a room for us and even upgraded it which was an added perk. We've been to New York a lot and have taken the dreaded red eye a few of those times and have had to check our bags at other hotels because they supposedly had no rooms available that early. That was not the case here. The prices were good for New Years and everything was to our satisfaction. The lobby has a nice bar area to chill at after a day of walking around NY. Our friends even came back to the lobby bar after we left and they were actually staying at another hotel.

On the other hand, the room was ""comfortable"" at least it had that going for it.Another drawback to this hotel is the concierge lounge.Nice docents but the place can be overcrowded in a hurry.Couple this to the food and beverage layout and what you can get is a terrible bottleneck trying to get to food on one side of the room, and beverages on the other side.And what's up with NO COOKED MEATS with the morning breakfast fare??? A little bacon goes a long way to make eggs go down easier.Getting the breakfast and afternoon servings ""refreshed"" was a little too slow as well.

There were some positives like finally a Marriott with pretty decent towels and sheets. This is the first Marriott I have stayed at where the bathroom towels don;t feel like sandpaper. It also looks as if the hotel has been renovated which was nice to see. For NYC, the front desk staff was moderately pleasant, not friendly, but not nasty either.Just okay. There were also quite a bit of upper management in the lobby which gives one the impression that they care. On the downside, the rooms are quite small, the air conditioner/heater units are hard to control and Marriott continues to put these crazy heavy duvees that double as bed spreads/blankets that make the beds incredibly hot. Also amazing was that even 5 floors up, you could here the street noise so loud and clear that we had to download a white noise making app...just to get to sleep. If you run a hotel in NYC, invest in noise reduction windows!Another down note was they were giving out ""NYC pretzels"" in the lobby. They were in chafing dishes and supposedly warm. I got one that was hard as a hockey puck and cold which is not the way to promote food operations in your hotel. The big issue I saw was security...or lack thereof. Most hotels especially in NYC go overboard to make sure you know and see security to deter anything happening. Not here. Never saw much security, no checks and balances when coming into the hotel.I came in very late at night and when I entered the lobby I did see 2 security guards talking by the front desk. I tried to show them my room key...and they never budged from their spot, never even looked at or acknowledged me. I tried several times holding up my key, I actually tried to get them to check to see if I was guest, they never even looked my way. Very disconcerting that anyone could just walk into the hotel with 2 guards in the lobby and no one asks for id or a room key.Great location , but there are some things that need to be addressed.","Brooklyn, New York","Risk12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",54,3.0

The hotel does not have much of a lobby area...literally two chairs. We sat at the lounge near the bar waiting for our ride. The server rudely asked us not to sit in those chairs (which many were empty) because they needed to be saved for those who were ordering drinks. I didn't think that was right.

Chose the Marriott East Side due to a combination of amenities, price and location. I'll discuss the good and the bad.The good-For $300 a night, the weekend after Thanksgiving, you can't go wrong. -Stayed in the king room (cozy). Room was large enough for 2 adults and very nice.-Gym was solid. Good assortment of cardio equipment. Limited weights, but never an issue getting on to a machine.-Amazing location. 15-20 minute walk to Times Square and Rockafeller Center. No need for a car and little need for a cab. Took one cab over the 2 nights, because we wanted to go to a restaurant about 2.5 miles away.-Lobby was gorgeous. The bad-Parking is $65 a night. No fault of the hotel, it's like that everywhere, but if you drive, be prepared. -Everything in the hotel is expensive. Be prepared to spend $40+ for breakfast for 2 after tip. There are local diners where you can get in and out for $20 which are only a 10-15 minute walk. A coffee was $4.50. Drinks at the bar are $12-$15. Again, no surprise, as everything in New York is very expensive. I'm just stating the facts.-I paid one night in gift cards and prepaid another night with rewards points, yet they still put almost a $700 hold on my credit card. (Which is still on it) Made little sense. Seeing everything was paid for. I wouldn't have even known this had I not looked at my card detail to make sure that I didn't have any odd charges being in the city. They offered to call the bank to lift the hold. However, had my credit card been near limit, this may have posed a problem when shopping. Thankfully, it wasn't and it didn't. Additionally, seeing I paid with the gift cards, I actually had over paid by $6. However, they destroyed the gift cards after scanning them. Therefore, I lost that balance. No biggie, but I stay at Marriott's about 40 nights per year for work. Therefore, one would think that they would have tried to accommodate. Strange. Overall, I had a good experience. However, I wasn't overly impressed with the attitudes of the employees. If I was staffing a hotel close to Times Square around the holidays, I would want happy and cheerful employees. Instead, they were so serious and difficult to talk to. Would I go back? Probably...unless I could get a different Marriott in the area for under $400.

My office is at 3rd Avenue and the Marriott East Side hotel is about a 5 minute walk from there. It was a real easy decision to stay at the hotel.The Marriott East Side is an older hotel that had a few major issues that I would like to highlight. For $500 a night, you expect a decent room...First, my room was on the 9th floor but it sounded like I was right on the street. Several times each night my sleep was interrupted with street noise. I am assuming that the windows are older and not that sound proof. So I would tend to want to stay up as high as you can to avoid as much of the street noise as possible. Second, the water temperature in the shower was very inconsistent, going from hot to cold and then back again frequently. Not something anyone likes.Third, the hotel room (standard room, two beds) was very small. It was just me on the trip so the size of the room was not an issue. But if my wife was travelling with me, the room would not have been acceptable.Conclusion....stay at this hotel if it is very convenient to your other travels in New York City (and it is just you alone without a travel partner), stay high up to avoid the street noise and, fingers crossed, the water temperature issue is something that won't repeat.","Hamilton, Bermuda","Mark P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamilton, Bermuda</strong>",3,3.0

This was a large room with 3 windows. All the windows faced other buildings with windows that were fairly close so I kept the shades pulled down all the time.Marriott always has the best beds, comfy pillows and the nicest linen! Everytime I sleep in one of their beds I fantasize about having one in my own home :) Upon my arrival at around 7pm many guests were gathered outside of the hotel waiting for taxis and before I had started to settle my taxi bill a doorman had my door open, my luggage out of the trunk of the taxi and someone else's lugaged placed in the the trunk! So there appeared to be a probably getting taxis around this time.Then once I was checked in there was group of people piled up in front of the elevator banks waiting for an elevator to come and I could hear a couple of people complaining about the long wait time. Outside of this peak time I did not have to wait long for the elevators at this office One thing that happened at this hotel which left me unsettled - on the day that I was leaving I had a bellman inside of the hotel ask me did I want to take a black car to the airport intead of a cab. When I asked him what was the difference he said that there is no difference, the black car will cost you $64 whilst the cab will be the flat rate of $52 + tolls + a tip. I was asked this when I left my bags in storage and again when I picked them up. I told him no I did not want to take a black car because I always take taxis to the airport. Then when I got outside of the hotel another bellman asked me did I want to take a black car to the airport and again I asked what was the difference and he said there is no difference. We had a bit of discussion on this but I felt like he was trying to encourage me to take a black car instead of a taxi. By time I got into my taxi I was really irritated. I felt like these bellman were encouraging me to take a black car because they were going to get a tip from the driver for doing so and in the end I would probably end up paying more for the black car than I would have for the taxi.A pet peeve of mine - there was no complimentary WiFi at this hotel!!At a rate of $499, WiFi should be included in the cost of this hotel.","Devonshire Parish, Bermuda","Lisa B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Devonshire Parish, Bermuda</strong>",47,3.0

Bed and bathroom were great. - good customer service at reception and good facilities for storing bags- multiple subway options nearbyCons:- our room had semi-transparent window blinds with no curtains. Not good for privacy esp as our room faced inwards to the hotel- upon checkout, the porter gave us a hard sell on booking a town car to the airport as opposed to using private cab or subway. I found this a bit surprising, both because the cab would cost three same or less and the subway was cheap and much shorter than the ""two hours"" ride he quoted to us.

Every 'boutique' hotel we stayed in NYC always featured a room a size of a matchbox. Marriott East Side, however, provided a quite spacious accommodation, where one doesn't feel cornered in. Plus the much nicer, much calmer and less crowded location - as opposed to West Side, Times Square, etc. - was definitely a big plus. A few other highlights. This was our first time a hotel room didn't have a mini-bar, which fell under 'good riddance' category. The lobby was crowded and lacked intimacy but it is fully expected from a Marriott. The soundproofing wasn't great as far as hallways and adjacent rooms were concerned, but our windows facing the bustling Lexington Ave did a good job of keeping the noise outside. A Manhattan hotels' inherent problem of rattling AC units wasn't that bad. And surprisingly the TV reception (on a decent size flat screen) wasn't bad either. The Wi-Fi is about $17 per day. Very expensive. The hotel parking/valet is very expensive too, around $75 per night. We, however, were able to get a Groupon deal for an Icon parking on 53rd St (about 9 minutes walk) and it cost us $46 for 2 nights. Breakfast provided by the hotel is as expensive as hotels breakfasts get, but the location offers you multiple other choices so you can save big. The value we got from Expedia was amazing, around $260 for 2 nights, but the usual rate is more like $400 per night. We would recommend one look for various deals (Groupon, LivingSocial, etc.) to get a more budget-friendly rate.","Mercerville, New Jersey","RGSOUNDF</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mercerville, New Jersey</strong>",1052,4.0

Hotel lobby feels like a trains station with a surprising deficit in personnel at the front desk. When we checked in (and got out ears talked off about nonsense while others waited) we were informed that they only had king size beds available and that one of us could sleep on the pull out sofa. I was not okay with this as this is one of the main reasons I chose to stay here. Manger got called over, simply to hand over our keys and to say there is nothing they could do since we booked through a 3rd party site and next time we should book directly through them (no apology, nothing). So basically selecting the option that says 2 double beds is essentially useless. The room itself was large and clean- but outdated and stark. It felt very inexpensive and old. Bathroom was as basic as it can be and the elevator doors were directly in front of our door- 2 feet in front- so several times when we opened a door there would be a person standing there looking directly into our room. The fact that to get to the gym you had to go through our floor didn't help with the traffic of people. I didn't hear much noise at night from it though so I suppose that's something. Next time I want to share a bed, I'll pick many of the other lovely options in NYC. Poor planning on my part I guess but really no reason to stay here unless it's free through your Marriott points program.","Boston, Massachusetts","Tasukete</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",198,3.0

What a fantastic location, Central Park, Times Square and lots more all in walking distance. Hotel/RoomGreat looking hotel, lobby showed off some classic looks and a nice modern bar. Lifts were old school but in a good way and corridoors nicely decorated. The room was very modern with great use of red, clean, tidy and contains everything you need; a safe, fridge, coffee maker, huge tv, closet, drawers, toiletries, fantastic shower, huge bed and iPhone/Ipod docking clocks! Our room was a little small but big enough for us. Apparently not all rooms have been modernised, unfortunately our view was another window of a room from the same hotel.FacilitiesGym was modern and had all the basics, equipment looked new. Bar was modern and expensive but free wi-fi for guests in lobby area. There was a shop hidding away between the lifts which had your typical tourist souveniours. StaffVery friendly and helpful staff, offering advice without being prompted, eager to help. American staff in general everywhere in NYC all seemed so friendly. Door person or security in the lobby or outside at all times.TransportTaxi from Newark Airport to Hotel was $70? A town car from Hotel to Newark was $90. Part of this was a toll charge for the bridge. Recommend booking transfer in advance before you go as will probably be cheaper. METRO CARD is a must, taxis costs can rack up, we bought a metro card which you can top up as you travel - use this on the bus and enter it into ta slot and it returns it to you minus the fare. Buses are fairly simple up and down or left and right, as its all in blocks. This can help if you are traveling from the Hotel all the way down to the financial district or just to help if the legs are getting tired.Tourist ThingsCentral Park on a sunny day is beautiful and would definately recommend a hiring a bike, there is a dedicated bike route and some areas are off limits to bikes. The Mall was impressive but unfortunately the Bethesda Fountain was closed for an event so couldnt access it. The lake has turtles in it! NYC Zoo was small and didnt have much however was worth it to see the Polar Bear.ShoppingMy girlfriend recommends Columbus Circle for variety and just enjoyed window shopping and quite reasonably priced as the big 'uns like Bloomingdales etc are expensive and left her depressed :-( Tiffany's jewelery was amazing but she was afraid to touch anything!The room on the top floor of New York Library was impressive and Bryant Park in general on a sunny day, people were playing chess, ping pong and they were showing films on giants screen outside.I thought Ripleys in London was better but was still interesting, Madame Tussaudes was fun but I've been to the one in London a few times now so is losing its appeal but a must for a newbie. Time Square at night was awesome, there is seating on top of the tkts office, if you climb to the top there is a live webcam which will show you on one of the giant screens.Grand Central Terminal was breath taking, its only a building but you just feel in awe. You MUST find the whispering corner, it really does work! Cheese Cake in the Central Terminal Market was lush. If you can view the lobby of the Crystler building, its grand and reminds me of old school New York.We took the train using our Metro Card to see the Yankees play at Yankee stadium, the train brought us right out the stadium, great stadium... I wish I bought a yankees top! We are not baseball fans but wanted to go for the experience, the atmosphere wasnt great but some of the classic baseball tunes were in there and everyone was friendly. We thought the hot dogs at american sport events were suppose to be huge when we sampled the basic hot dog it was like a one from a tin can :-( despite these is was a good experience and would still definately recommend it.Pier 25 adventure golf was great, shame the water feature wasnt working. We want to go to a traditional american diner and was so disappointed that the famous empire diner had closed, we bumped into pearl street diner and my girlfriend said she had the best burger EVER! Police Museum, statue of liberty were closed due to hurricane sandy.Wouldnt recommend South Street Sea Port, museum of sex, empire state buildingDefinately recommend, Helicopter ride, Top of the Rock, staten island ferry, Grand Central Terminal, Central Park, Blue Man Group(Theatre Show), Pier 25 Golf, High Line","Cardiff, United Kingdom","JourneyJournal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cardiff, United Kingdom</strong>",3,5.0

The front desk staff and bell staff are so dispirited or maybe I should say they are jaded but they just don't care. I arrived on a Sunday night and it was pouring rain. The hotel rooms do not have umbrellas in them so I asked both the front desk and bell staff if they could loan me an umbrella. ""No"" was the answer. I asked if they had any suggestions as I had to head to my office a few blocks away and it was pouring rain. The only comment one staff member had was ""I think there is a Duane Reed a few blocks away and they may still be open. Maybe they have umbrellas"" Thanks a lot. I spend more than 50 nights a year in hotels for work. Not only does this make me not want to stay at this hotel ever again, but it means that a Marriott hotel anywhere in the world will be at the bottom of my list for future travel.One other odd thing of note about the hotel was the heavy uniformed security presence in the lobby at night. There were at least 2 security officers (if not more). Maybe that makes some people feel safe, but it made me really uneasy.

Kenda called downstairs and had the custodial care bring up a bunch of flat boxes all taped up ready for us to transport. Now that is going well above and beyond her scope of duties.

What a treat this was! My spacious ""cozy king room"" was very clean, which is important to me. I had seen a promotion on the website about a complimentary breakfast. Of course, I called and spoke with the Front Desk Manager who agreed to give me one free breakfast during my stay. I was annoyed that I overslept and went down to breakfast at 8 a.m. because I wanted to avoid the crowds and lines. There were no lines nor crowds, although plenty of people were eating. The waiter John who took my order was friendly, accommodating and had a great personality. The food was delicious, and there were nutritious items to choose from. I also liked the quick check-out options via TV or phone. This property is close to the Theatre District, and I was able to walk to the theatre instead of riding the subways.

The most common thing is heavy entrance doors that is difficult to open when you are in the wheelchair and in the rooms you will find tiny, tiny bathrooms with a bathtub that is hard to climb in to.I stayed at Marriott East Side in early March 2013 and was very happy and surprised when I noticed how wheelchair friendly the hotel really is!There is a smart placed wheelchair ramp outside to the right side of the entrance and automatic door openers are placed at the top of the ramp/by the doors inside the lobby.The room I stayed in (1431) is a nice room with a spacious bathroom where you will find a lowered WC, sink and shower head. Handrails are mounted on the walls both by the WC and in the shower.It will be my pleasure to recommend Marriott East Side to people who will need a wheelchair friendly accommodation in Manhattan.Marriott East Side will be my obvious choice when I travel to New York City in the future!","Stockholm, Sweden","mattiasadamsson</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",5,5.0

It took us that afternoon and until 6 pm the next evening before WE sorted it out without assistance from Marriott staff - our holiday was ruined as we were put through so much stress - in fact we couldn't wait to come home.

The hotel is superbly located and we had a great basic room. The problem with this stay is that on our first night after checking in from the UK we were called in our room because our card had been declined. We asked if we could sort it in the morning as we had gone to bed and were advised if we could not come down to reception security would be sent to the room - we think this is not the way guests should be treated, especially those who are members of Marriott Rewards. We were booked in for 3 days. When we spoke with the front desk they said card decline happened all the time with UK cards - our experience too - so why may I ask do we get a threat of a visit by security. Once call to the UK sorted the card issue immediately. A second issue was that on checkout we were overcharged - the error was rectified as soon as I bought it to the front desk reception but I was very unimpressed and again a first for us staying with Marriott - it was around 100 dollars so not an insignificant amount. So this time we had a poor experience of the hotel. We would still return as its convenient and we will stay loyal to Marriott these were obviously glitches but do check you bill.

Overall, it's been relatively consistent over the years. I would say the best thing going for it is the location. The lobby is relatively small without much seating and bar sort of off to the side. The rooms are small, but typical for New York. I stayed in the ""superior"" room, which was almost the size of a regular hotel room in most other cities. The room was clean although for some reason both nights they either came very early or didn't do turndown service. Not a big deal but strange that it would happen two nights in a row. Only real complaints were the street noise (even on the 31 st floor) and the fact that most rooms are either near elevator or ice machine (small building on upper floors). The concierge room is large although selection lacking vs other full service marriotts.Bottom line is for a midtown NY hotel it's conveniently located and not in as congested an area as time square.

As far as value, it is NYC so it is gonna be expensive. However, at these rates you can go to a much nicer hotel.5. The lobby is darkish, but plenty of seats and tables for coffee and impromptu meetings.6. Concierge level on 16 is nice. Really nice patio out the back of the room if the weather is nice. A little weird to pay $8.50 for a glass of wine in the concierge level, so I didn't. 7.

I would consider this an average hotel for the business traveler. The room was ok, nothing to write home about. Bathroom was a comfortable size and bed was very comfortable with a good size closet. The window coverings were not adequate for privacy. The elevators are very small which leads me to believe this was an old hotel that was renovated and they didn't bother to re-size the elevators. At least there were express elevators to the top floor. The staff were very friendly and helpful and check-in was smooth. Checkout was easy given I could do it via the TV. The only complaint I have is that they charge extra for using wifi. This is not at all convenient for the business traveler as it makes it that much more difficult to expense the extra charge. Although I found that northeastern hotels tend to nickel and dime travelers on charges whereas down south they're not as bad. Overall, my stay was pleasant and comfortable but doesn't rise to the level of 5 stars. This is certainly not a luxury property.

All the staff were very friendly throughout our stay. We arrived early and had no issue with early check in. The room was very clean and linens refreshed daily. I found the hotel to be above average in these details. The bed was extremely comfortable, as were the pillows - it was like sleeping at home!However, I did have a couple of issues. My first issue was I had to ask for the coffee to be replaced. The room had been cleaned, and for what ever reason, the coffee was not replenished. This request took about an hour. Second, we had brought wine glasses up to our room for the bar, in other hotels I have stayed I have done this, and when the room was cleaned, the glasses were cleaned also. This was not the case - not a big deal, but I was a bit surprised. Lastly, at about 4pm I called room service, because I was in need of champagne glasses, as we wanted to have a glass of Prosecco. Room service was not in operation until 5pm. So I called the front desk and asked if we could have the glasses brought to our room, as we were in the process of getting ready for an evening out. The answer was no. We had to wait for room service to open. It made me wonder what would have happened if I needed an extra towel or blanket?? Regardless, we thought we would have the prosecco when we returned. Upon returning to the hotel (about 10pm) I walked to the front desk prior to going to the room, and asked to have the champagne glasses. Again the response was great, not a problem it would be sent up right away. We waited for over 40 minutes - no glasses ever arrived. We gave up and went to bed. While these are ""minor"" issues - they were still very annoying. Were there things I could have done like called back down to the desk or gone to the bar myself? Sure...but as a guest I shouldn't have to.So to recap - Very Clean, very polite, very comfortable. But, the service end could be improved upon. One last observation: Just a tip - I paid less for my martini at Delmonico's Restaurant. They were identical Martini’s – Hendrick’s Gin, Dry, two olives. $22 for a Martini is outrageous.","Ottawa, Canada","TMWife</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",0,4.0

(I should note that when I checked the box for a ""family"" trip, while we are a family, none of us are children so I don't have info on kids' activities.)Our group had two rooms: my parents had a double bed room and the other four of us in our party shared a room with two double beds. The first and possibly most impressive thing was the size of the rooms for a NY hotel. The four of us were able to stay comfortably in our room, and there was even enough room for my parents to come up and hang out in our room for a bit. My parents' room wasn't bad at all, either. The hallways were wide enough to make it easy to drive your suitcase around, and the elevators were remarkably quick and big enough that several of us could fit inside with luggage. This reduced the crunch you usually see around checkout time, or the need to let several elevators pass before you can go anywhere.The room and bathroom were both very clean. The shower was good - a little hard to regulate the water temperature at times, but good water pressure. The amenities generally were very nice and completely functional. Good hairdryer. No frills, if that's important to you, but it was not to us. There was also a mini fridge and safe in the room. We heard the road noise at night a little bit at night and the fridge kind of made noise, but it wasn't a huge deal, just possibly not the quietest room ever.The gym also was really big for any hotel, especially a city one. There were about three or four ellipitcals, two or three bikes and three or four treadmills, along with some weight machines and free weights. The only weird thing is that you have to switch elevators a few times to get there since it's on the 35th floor. But the view is great and the facility is worth the trip.All of the staff was incredibly nice. Our rooms were under one reservation and my parents had checked in the day before us. When we checked in, the staff remembered who we were and had everything ready for us right away. There's a little Starbucks/breakfast place in the lobby that turns into a bar later on in the day. Great place for people to chill out in the morning and wait for others in the group. They may have had wifi, but I'm not sure - saw lots of people on their computers in the lobby. The location of the hotel is also ideal because it's fairly close to walk to (or easy to take the subway or a cab to) pretty much all the things you might wish to do as a tourist (or in our case, a group of tourists). We sometimes needed more than one cab to get somewhere due to the size of our party, but never had to wait outside the hotel more than about 30 seconds to get as many cabs as we needed.I would definitely stay here again, with or without a group.",Washington DC,"NoVaTripper</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC</strong>",25,5.0

I know this is New York, but smaller than other hotels I have stayed at in mid-town. I liked the location. Most other hotels are near Times Square and too busy and touristy. This is a quieter and nicer area, with a number of good restaurants nearby.

The lobby has nothing to it and so without club it is not the same vibe at all. Club is on the 16th floor and is fantastic. I find that I don't have to eat out much at all if I have club as the meals are filling. I've had macaroni and cheese, cheese and meat plates, chicken Caesar salad, made-to-order eggs, pasta, on various different days. Fabulous. Sad that the patio is closed on a day when it is 60 degrees out. Hope it reopens later. The patio is also a plus. You can sit on a sweet little table and enjoy some air, which is a rare privilege. There is also an exercise club on the higher floors.

For us, though, we went to museums and restaurants and did some shopping in lower and upper Manhattan, so the proximity of the Marriott to a bunch of subway lines was a big plus (you can pick up the 6 train 2 blocks north or the E train 3 blocks north).

The rooms, lobby and overall appearance is very clean and the location is great. The big negative and I mean really big is the restaurant which is awful. After three great stays there with nice experiences in the restaurant for breakfast and once or twice for dinner, the restaurant changed names and apparently personality. The manager was arrogant and oblivious to the simple idea of making sure a party of four could be seated in a near empty restaurant. Once seated, we were ignored for fifteen minutes.....no water, no service, nothing!! We had to get up fom the table and ask who our waiter was. Once we ordered dinner, the food took fifty minutes to arrive and was barely passable in terms of preparation. By any standards, this was bad. I decided to complain to the hotel manager since the restaurant manager was someone who does not belong in a marriott. I was compensated by being given 10,000 additional Marriott Rewards Points. Despite this nice gesture, the experience was so bad it makes this hotel a no-go on my next trip to New York.

The hotel has a good location, outside of the hustle bustle of Times Square, but still central. The lobby renovations look terrific. However, on this visit I upgraded to a ""Larger"" Guest Room. This was a mistake. Apparently, all of the ""Larger"" rooms are in the same vertical line of rooms. Although I had asked for a room on a higher floor in my profile, I was first given a room on the 8th floor. The room was large and newly renovated, but not surprisingly, it was easy to hear significant street noise. In addition, on my first flush, the toilet did not work and a loud whirring noise resulted without an actual flush. I went to the lobby to request a room with a functioning toilet and on a higher floor. I was then sent to the 15th floor. Although it was somewhat higher, this room was significantly worse. This was obviously an older renovation, but aside from that, had several major defects. First, the wi-fi did not work (it kept kicking me off the site). When I called the operator, the hotel transfered me to some third party company that kept me on hold for about five minutes, and then told me it would take 30-45 minutes to test, and asked that I keep trying to use the wi-fi so that they could see what the problem was. Ultimately, they could not solve the problem. Second, the pipes banging behind the bathroom would periodically but regularly bang every few seconds. I went back to the lobby and spoke to Chris at the front desk. Chris advised that I should call back from my room when the banging was occurring and he'd send maintenance. He also denied that he was aware of a wi-fi problem. When I asked for a room with functioning wi-fi and no pipes banging, he told me that all of the rooms that are the size I booked were on the same vertical line and that it wouldn't change anything to move. He made no effort to move me and was seemingly unconcerned about these issues.I resigned myself to no wi-fi and a loud night. In addition to constant banging of pipes (audible even with the bathroom door closed), the 3 am garbage pickup which seemed to last about 30 minutes was the topper. Bottom line is that I was very disappointed with the room and very disappointed with the hotel's attitude when I ran into problems. I will not be returning anytime soon...","Miami, Florida","MiamiMark5</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",15,2.0

When my fiancée and I arrived, we were greeted by none other than the GM himself, who was out on the street, welcoming guests. I don’t often see this and right away I knew this guy was the best. He warmly greeted us, remembered us and made sure we were taken care of at the front desk. Jimmy (I think) was the bellman and he took our many many (too many) suitcases and also made us feel at home.Later on, we met Calvin in the Concierge Lounge, who had remembered us (I guess from an email from the GM). Chris told me about you and your fiancée. Calvin was awesome and treated all the guests like royalty, going the extra mile to make sure they had the very best he could offer. Later that day I caught the GM helping rearrange the chairs in the Concierge Lounge and said to myself, “A hands-on manager –THEY are the best of the best. NOW I know why these employees are even above the normal Marriott Excellence”. He gets out of his office to mingle and be a part of the team.

This left my family of 4 deciding to climb 12 flights if stairs up and down rather than wait the 5-10 minutes for an elevator with enough room for us.

Since he travels and we have been married for 20+ years, I have checked in many times without him present but not at this hotel. I understand security however I presented ID which should have satisfied the requirement. We had three children with us and wanted connecting rooms. Instead, we got two rooms on the same floor located on opposite ends of the building. One of the rooms was located next to the elevator which we specifically requested a quiet room away from the elevator which was also noted on the reservation. The room was extremely noisy with the noise from the elevator shaft and guests getting off and on the elevator. The heater also did not function properly. The room would be extremely hot and then get extremely cold. The toilet also would fill intermittently due to a leaky valve in the tank. Eventually, I had to close the bathroom door to eliminate the noise.When we went to get our car from the valet, they told us it would be 15 minutes instead we waited an hour and were told ever ten minutes that they lost our car.

We were paying for the first night and using Marriott Reward Points for the 2nd and 3rd. For the first night we had a Junior Suite, which was a courtesy upgrade by Marriott. That was a very nice perk for being a rewards member. It was an awesome room with French doors between the living room and bedroom. The living room had a comfortable pull out sofa, television, chest of drawers, and desk. The bedroom had two doubles and television. The best part of this room was that the vanity was outside of the bathroom, so that we could be more efficient with our time.Unfortunately, we had to move rooms for the two nights using points, which meant we had to check out in the morning and check back in at 4 PM. We were gone all day, so that part wasn't a problem, but it was just a little annoyance. We had to wait on our luggage to be brought back up and ask a couple of times for a rollaway. This was a standard room with two doubles. The rollaway was a tight fit between the wall and one bed. It was too short for a grown person. The bathroom in this standard room was very small and had the vanity inside.The front desk, bell hops, and doorman are all friendly (for NYC). The doorman, called a car service for us for the airport, which only took 20 minutes. The price was $50 higher, however, than in July!!! This time it was $110 (cash) + tips to driver & doorman. Taxis are also readily available.We like this location because we can walk to Central Park, Times Square, the theater, and Grand Central.We walked to Patsy's Pizzaria for a good meal and also to Comfort Diner for breakfast.

The location itself is relatively convenient. There are no subway station in the immediate proximity of the hotel, so you need to walk about 5 minutes to Grand Central to take the 7 to Times Square or the 6 to Union Square. Walking to Times Square takes about 15-20 minutes.The rooms are bland, standard, and reliable. Just what you would expect in a Marriott of this category. The rooms are impecable and a pretty decent size for New York.Breakfast was good (but VERY expensive), bundle breakfast with your room if you're going to have it, much better value usually. The lunch I had there was catered, but was surprisingly good, especially considering the amount of people that were there. Nothing fancy, but it was obvious they used good quality ingredients.It might be a matter of taste, but I find both the interior and exterior of the building beautiful and well integrated with the neighborhood. It's definitely a plus for me, especially since it was recently renovated. The neighborhood itself is great. Grand Central is definitely worth seeing. Very close to the Rockefeller Center too.This hotel often offers deals that are really good value especially if you pre-pay. It's obviously never going to be the same as being in Times Square, but if you can score one of these deals, it might tip the balance because there can be a huge price differential.I can't say much about the service other than both my stays were trouble free. I had no reason to interact with the staff, but the few interactions that I had were pleasant.All in all, I think this is a fantastic option if you are going to New York. If this is your first time in New York and you are a little apprehensive about taking the subway or missing out on the action, then it might make sense to pay extra to be in Times Square, but I think it's hard to go wrong with this hotel, especially if you can score a decent deal. It's a Marriott, so don't expect that boutique feel, but I think the beauty of the building somewhat makes up for that.

I asked about my room options and was given several diferent choices. Jimmy, from the bell staff recommended a room that was away from the street noise. We were very happy with his recommendation. Throughout the stay, Jimmy knew us by name and was very helpful with restaurant recommendations and he arranged for a very reasonably priced private car to take us to JFK for our return home. We took the time to talk with most of the staff that we came in contact with and nearly every person was either directly or indirectly seriously impacted by the storm yet they had smiles on their faces and were genuinely interested in making sure that we were taken care of. The hotel location is perfect for a family vacation. We ate at several small diners and restaurants in walking distance (good food at a reasonable price). We did not have any meals in the hotel simply because we like to get out and see the city. Times Square, shopping, MOMA, Rockefeller Center are all within easy walking distance.

It is a dire situation at all the coastal regions and yet walking around midtown 2 days later there is very little evidence of problems except the horrendously slow traffic due to the major subways lines still being under water and also tree limbs being cleared up; on the streets, the parks are closed. Our hearts go out those in all the states affected and we wish for a speedy recovery.We had a flood of our own in the room the 1st night as we were settling into bed; we love to travel but it is physically grueling. The toilet sounded funny and when I went in to see what the noise was it started overflowing. I know how to fix a toilet, so I took off the cover and the trap would not stay shut; then the unit broke and the Gusher came. I called for help and they were there very quickly. he did tell me that we could not stay there because it was too wet-really flooded; so we had to pack everything up and move upstairs. We are gold elite members and they never bothered to even apologize for the inconvenience let alone do anything for us that was disappointing. What really appalled us was when we went down the next day and asked the concierge if he has a bus map . 1st he acted like we were bothering him and then he said no. I asked him what streets the buses travel crosstown and unbelievably he said, I don't know I don't take the bus. Clearly he either does not like people or has objections to working on Sunday I am not sure but he should not be in that job.He looked it up for me on the web and told me 42nd and 57th. After I was on the street and walking toward 57th, I realized that 1/2 block away @ 49t st was the cross town bus we were inquiring about. So he looked it up and then me incorrect information-great concierge-NOT.Afterward when I was looking through the book I rcvd from him I realized that there was both a subway and bus map in back of the book. I did get a bus map from the lady working there on wed-who greeted us before we even got to her counter. She opened the door and took it off the shelf where there were dozens of others and said that her colleague only worked Sunday and didn't know they were there-then it is a case lack of training; but to me it looks like a lack of ambition on his part. Open the door and see what tools you have to do your job when you sre sitting thee doing nothing. Interesting indeed. With the exception of the Sunday concierge I felt that all other staff we ran into we cheerful, caring, and helpful. As Gold members we are allowed to use the lounge and have fruit, beverages, yogurt and other goodies during the day and enough food to make dinner at night {membership has it's priviledges} it was lovely not to be stuck in our rooms for the duration of Monday when we could not go out on the street after 11am. Margaret during the day and Kenda at night were cheerful and helpful to everyone I saw ask them for assistance. I love Marriott because they have the best beds and in most cases the best staff. Although we had a tiny room, it's New York and all rooms are small and expensive.This one did not disappoint overall-we really can't complain as we used points for the entire stay however we did spend a lot to get those points. Either way we would def come back here. Found Keats karaoke bar on 2nd between 44th and 45th which was a fun and welcoming spot. There are a lot of good restaurants near the hotel. Just 3 avenues from shopping on 5th and and 2 avenues from 2nd where there are a lot of Irish bars.

We chose Marriott mainly because of the location, and the brand's name- thinking that you can not go wrong with Marriott. Well, apparntley, you can: I will start with the positive- the hotel location is fantastic, a short walk to the MoMA, Rockerfeller center/plaza, top of the rock, Empire State etc.. The hotel is indeed nice and overall clean. Having said that, we had some issues that prevented us from truely enjoying staying in the hotel. I will start by saying my spouse and I are easily stasiftied, and that almost every B&B or hotel we stayed at was good to excelllent for our needs. 1. Upon our arrival (~11am), the lobby was packed, and we were told that our room is not ready yet. This was, of course, understandable. I was asked to leave my phone number, and was told that once the room is available, I will be contacted. This sounded very reasonable, and so, we left our luggage and went on with our holiday plans to experience the city. It was around 2, when we wondered what's going on. When we arrived back at the hotel, we got our room. No one bothered calling me to tell me it's ready- despite stating this when I first arrived2. The room: a standard room, which was big and clean. In the middle of room there was a huge metal door - it appears to me that this door was used to connect two rooms together. The second room which was next to ours, was acoomodated by guests, and so, I really have to wonder why using rooms that are conencted by a door, when the guests are not related? Moreover, we found a breakfast menu that was used by the guest who stayed there the day before us (it had the date and his requests for breakfast) - which certainly gives you the feeling the place wans't cleaned as much as you'd like before your arrival. Please bear in mind that the room didn't have any sort of refreshments- not even a simple bottle of water (simple B&B's in Maine/NH/Vermont offer that- and the famous Marriott don't..). There are no water machines as well, if you'd like to fill in your bottels. Also, don't expect a real 'free wifi' - it's time limited.Noise: We were staying in the 19th floor, but you could still hear the traffic noise pretty loudly. This is also the place to say that the A/C the room had was snoring and making loud noises almost constantly while being on. We had to turn it off to go to sleep.I'm rating the clean level as 3, only because of the menu issue. I know it might sound silly, but it simply gave both of us the feeling the place wasn't really cleaned prior to our arrival.3. Breakfast: I didn't like the fact there are no vegtebales, and that you don't have free access to juice/water/specific foods (i.e. waffels) - you are being served, and need to request everything. I guess some people would like being served, but I would enjoy serving myself better, without having to call (or tip) a waiter for bringing me a simple glass of water4. Tipping: this one correaltes with (3) actually, and comes back to the fact that you are being served, no matter what. You will have to tip the staff for everything- and when I say 'have' I do mean so: When a staff member brought a bag of mine (while I said I can handle it myself, and thanked him), he didn't move away until I tipped him. I do like giving tips for good service, and am certainly not trying to be rude or save money here, but having to tip the staff for everything they do, even if you don't ask them (or specifically tell them you got that covered), was tiring and annoying.The bottom line:This place has great location, and the price we got was good as well. If you like being served, and don't mind not getting anything 'more' (water? decent buffet breakfast with free access? free wifi access?) - you should consider staying in here.

And on top of that they added on the city taxes and whatnot and the mandatory gratuity (even though the service was non existant) and it cost the three of us $120 for breakfast. My advice would be to skip eating at the restaurant and go get a more reasonable breakfast. The shining star at this hotel was the woman at the concierge desk up in the concierge lounge. She was awesome. She had great ideas for what to do with the teens, got us free tickets into the freedom tower and the 9/11 memorial even though I tried myself and was told there were no tickets left. And she reserved us tickets to the Empire State Building. Finally, she armed us with maps so that I felt pretty confident heading out. I would stay here again. It was a nice location. We were able to walk to the NHL store, Niketown, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Chanel, etc. very pretty walk.","Simsbury, Connecticut","cancercaregiver</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Simsbury, Connecticut</strong>",93,4.0

Room was clean, quiet, and roomy. Had a frigde, coffee maker, nice shower. The only funky thing about hotel is that you have to take an elevator to the 32nd floor to switch to another elevator to get to the 35th floor gym. I ended up just using the stairwell. The gym itself was a little smaller that i might have expected for a hotel this size - but had everything you needed to at least have a decent workout.Ate at the hotel restaurant - was pretty good, a little pricey. and unusual for me, even though I was a party of one - they added 15% gratuity to the bill, thought that was oddAnyway - no reason to not pick this place - very good choice","Buffalo, NY","RobBflo1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Buffalo, NY</strong>",145,4.0

Not too bad but by the end of our 4 days there the walk was getting a bit annoying. The hotel was great though! Clean, no signs of any bugs (and I really checked), and a great staff at the front desk and the bell service. Big problem with it though: the concierge was completely useless. They couldn't tell us anything or help us with any questions we had about where something was or the best way to get somewhere was. Not to mention they were almost always closed. They weren't open early in the morning when we left and they were closed by the time we got back most days. The worst part was them refusing to book us a SuperShuttle to the airport because they thought we should just take a cab. It was the bell service staff that explained all our options and was willing to help us with it. We ended up using the hotels' car service to get back to the hotel. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend using the car service! It was a flat rate of US$45. The Super Shuttle that we got from the airport (LGA) was US$15 per person and it was a crowded van that made multiple stops. We travelled in 3 so the car service worked out to US$15 each anyway and was a much better and relaxing drive to the airport. Just don't bother asking the concierge for help with that!We stayed in room 720 and it was pretty small but not uncomfortably small for 3 girls with giant suitcases and shoes everywhere :) The bathroom was a good size. Our windows looked out to a wall about 2 meters away so definitely no view there. Overall, the hotel was great. I would've given it a 5 star rating had the concierge done something of use at one point or another. Honestly, the Marriott should be embarrassed. Their concierge service is holding them down.","Ontario, Canada","Valerie1989</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ontario, Canada</strong>",18,4.0

Therefore, this review will mainly consist of my EXPERIENCE this time around rather than describing the hotel amenities, etc.I went ahead and booked it (two rooms in fact with the referral I gave my Aussie friends) and contacted the GM IMMEDIATELY after booking the room- Christopher Hosmer. He was out of town and I booked a non refundable rate. I was told a suite would be unavailable but I would receive a junior suite (with french doors), which I was happy with as this would suffice for my purposes. Upon check in I was told I had a ""junior suite"" but when I entered it was indeed the large room, no divider walls after countless calls and a written confirmation (on Marriott's site). I went downstairs and spoke with Richard (the evening manager) who insisted the room assigned was a junior suite (which did not meet the specifications if you look at the room details of the junior suite - two televisions, french doors, etc on their site under room details). My battery was dead on my phone and I was unable to pull up the confirmation and stumbled through luggage to look for the printed version for my two night stay. Finally, Richard emerged with a confirmation stating it was a ""larger room."" I was beside myself and ready to move to another property. As I was calling other properties in desperation and considering leaving the city, Richard finally came back out and stated he would be able to give me the junior suite for the two nights booked under my name and apologized, shook my hand, etc. I happily went to the new room, which was absolutely fine.We ended up having a great time but after such a delayed flight from LAX and then meeting my friends, we ended up sleeping in until pretty late to get a late start on the only full day that I had there. After check out, my friends advised me the Marriott would be charging me an additional night in fees and said I did not fully prepay this, which I did (even have the confirmation and charge made in July) when I was already back in LA. I contacted them and will be disputing this with my credit card company. Never again will I trust this hotel and there is no way this can be made up. I was completely lied to and mislead and this is not the way to treat customers - ever! This is my own opinion and I truly dislike writing reviews that reflect a negative opinion, but the truth should be out there and people should not have to deal with crooks who run a hotel. I think Tony Soprano would do a better job then the persons managing this property.","Beverly Hills, California","traveler4k</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beverly Hills, California</strong>",824,1.0

The shower was clean, the room stayed cool with the AC on, and we never had a problem getting a cab to go anywhere we wanted to go.On check out they let us stash our bags so we could go explore the city for the last few hours we had left. They also hooked us up with a car service to the airport, which if you're going to JFK this is the only way to go. $65, including tolls, tips, and the car.

Cabs are always plentiful right on Lexington Avenue at the hotel entrance.My particular stay was for three nights while on business travel.

While it has updated shower curtains and counters, the bathroom itself is still very old (though very clean). The next renovation should bring it more up to date with the rooms. The bedrooms are the standard Marriott beds and always very comfortable. Also, the club floor is large, and while busy in the mornings, always had an open seat.If you're looking for a solid Marriott property in the heart of Manhattan, skip the Marriott Marquis in Times Square and head here.

Also, no surprise fees or charges, everything here was above board. The room itself was nice, I know some others have said small - but for NYC I thought it was actually pretty good sized. Cleaning staff did a great job and room was always in good shape when we returned to it. My only complaints are that the bed was not very comfortable and our room was NOISY. I think it was because we were right next to the maid closet but we could hear door slamming, a hammering noise etc. Also, I recommend requesting a higher floor if you are bothered by traffic noise.

But, not a deal breaker since the hotel was fine otherwise.Whenever we checked into the hotel, the clerk told us we would not be able to have the room we paid for (with double beds) since we made our reservation through Hotels.com instead of Marriott. I actually spent a couple of weeks researching online and calling NYC hotels trying to find a room with double beds in our price range. She was telling us we would have to take a room with a king size bed. I could have booked a king room at a nicer hotel for much less than we had paid for what we needed (2 doubles) at this hotel. Whenever we balked over not getting what we paid for, she called her manager and decided we could have a double room after all. Really was irritating that our check-in wasn't seamless like it should have been. On a positive note, we were able to check-in at 2:00 pm.","Tyler, Texas","Wonderville</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tyler, Texas</strong>",12,4.0

The hotel even sent complimentary beer and treats for the girls when they were in the room. The room was clean, fresh, modern.

If you need to go uptown or downtown on the west side, just take the train one stop down to Grand Central and use the S (shuttle) to Times Square and transfer to another train. Just be careful not to exit the subway station during these transfers (it's easy to just follow everyone else out the exit door without thinking).Easy walking to Times Square and Central Park South (both about 15 minutes).Starbucks on the next block, Red Stone Pizzaria across from Starbucks, and Cafe Metro (pasta, salad, subs) a few blocks away.*Quiet: Our room, 1517, was away from the street and extremely quiet. Three small windows with views of the sides and roofs of buildings was the trade-off.*Service: Front desk always friendly and helpful. We requested a rollaway bed and we were given the larger 2 double bed room to accommodate it. Again, no view in this room and it was subject to availability.Jimmy, the doorman, also friendly and helpful. There were plenty of taxis continuously coming by and Jimmy would hail one quickly. The hotel also had cars and SUV's sitting out front for guests to rent. I took an SUV back to the airport so that we would have AC and more luggage room. The cost was $60 + tolls (the driver gave me a choice of bridge with no toll or tunnel with $6.50 toll). This was only $15 more than a taxi. *Room: Beds and pillows were comfortable (too soft for my taste, but most people prefer this). Shades were adequate to block morning sun. Closet with full-sized door mirror, disposable slippers, wooden hangers, ironing board & iron, free safe, and blow dryer. Flat screen TV. Coffee maker. Desk with comfortable chair. We also had two arm chairs, an end table, and one ottoman. The AC was adequate. The bathroom in our room was large with vanity inside.Our traveling companions had the 16th Floor Suite, which was large and beautiful and inlcuded amazing views from the wraparound deck.*Business Center: Several computers and free access to internet for 10 minutes to print boarding passes, but you have to click through the link on the home screen (one person in our party didn't see it and paid $16.95 to use the internet and then the browser didn't have the correct download to print the boarding pass, so be careful not to do it that way). Printing when going through the link was also free.*Gift Shop: $3 for a cup of coffee and she makes it for you in an expresso/cappuccino machine. Plenty of NYC souvenirs, but you will pay for the convenience.*Elevators: Two sets of four that access different floors. Small, but fast service.*Meeting Facilities: We did not use these, but saw a Bloomingdale's meeting with a Gucci step and repeat. Appeared to have very attentive staff.*On-Site Restaurant: I had the breakfast buffet once during the stay, and the food was great. Plenty of choices.Cons:*Internet Fee: $16.95 per day and it is from noon to noon, regardless of when you first access it. I called and compained and no charge was on my bill, which I very much appreciated, since I only used it for a few hours. This policy is definitely something that needs to be changed!*No Pool: But this is typical in NYC. The trade-off is the character of the older buildings.*No Fan in Bathroom: Again, typical in older NYC buildings.And just a side note about Marriott customer service: I first attempted to book this hotel through a link on TravelZoo, but there was a glitch on Marriott's site that wouldn't let me complete the transaction at the given price. I called Marriott and they actually gave me the room at a better price.","Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida","StarfishandSeashells</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida</strong>",380,5.0

I was demanded to show photo ID and questioned over and over about my address, my husband's business address. They even asked me to recite to them his business address, street number, zip code and all. They said it was for security purposes- basically they didn't think I belonged there. They insisted my husband better be coming later in the evening. The manager was less than sympathetic, and when my husband called him from England (he was travelling on business staying at another MARRIOTT PROPERTY in England during all this) he got the same unsympathetic answer.

Within walking distance (a very hearty walk, but a walk nonetheless) of Central Park and Times Square and about eight blocks from Grand Central Station. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The room we got was advertised as a ""Cozy Room"", which had me worried. But, for my wife and I, it was plenty of room for us - especially since we were treating our New York experience like a Vegas experience, spending as little time in the room as possible and most of our time out in the city. Not a ton of elbow room, but there was plenty of room to put out an ironing board - stuff like that.New York is an expensive city. I get that. You have to know that going in. Unless you're from San Francisco, everything in New York is going to be about twice as much as you're used to in certain areas. However, my jaw dropped when I found out that daily WiFi service is $16.95. That's the biggest stick-up crime in the hotel business and frequent travellers know it. I've personally decided to draw the line and not give in. Not if I'm travelling on business and my company is footing the bill, and certainly not if I'm on vacation and can afford it anyway. The more people roll their eyes, give in and pay, the more these hotels will continue to gouge WiFi charges. Heck - you can get WiFi service on a flying airplane for $10. But $17?? Theft. I report the following in hopes that Marriott management reads this. Across 48th street from the Marriott is a Raddisson Hotel, and in their lobby is free WiFi, a Starbucks, and a lobby bar that does not include gratuity into all checks (525 Lex, the lobby bar of the Marriott, does). So, each morning, and each afternoon as we came back from sightseeing and were getting reorganized and cleaned up before going out for dinner, we visited the Raddisson - paying them $17 and then some - on coffee and breakfast, or afternoon cocktails, in order to use free WiFi. Again, after a while it comes down to principle when you, the ""guest"", keep getting racked with ridiculous fees that other competitors will gladly provide at no cost; or have the common sense to hide those costs somewhere else.The Marriott East Side will likely not flinch if 100 other people follow my lead and put their foot down on WiFi price gouging, but I feel gratified supporting other hotels in other ways who have good customer service sense.That little beef aside, this was a nice hotel in a good part of town and good for a visit.","Grand Prairie, Texas","Fletch32</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Grand Prairie, Texas</strong>",270,3.0

During the week around 5pm the staff had a welcome table inside of the hotel; each day something different was offered at no charge. The staff prepared sangria drinks, gave out backpacks, candy, bonus Marriott points, flavored water, etc. The above was a nice touch. The hotel lobby is smaller as compared to the Marriott Marquis; this gives the hotel a more personal and friendly atmosphere. We love this hotel and would not stay anywhere else. The location is perfect; less crowded and an easy walk to Times Square or Central Park and easy access to the subways or buses.

Both are great, and I simply chose the Chelsea one because I've developed a rapport with the manager. This time, I decided to go ""first class"" and stay at the Marriott East Side, and while there was nothing wrong with the hotel per se, I was still disappointed. My first complaint is likely irrelevant for the vast majority of travellers, but the concierge lounge was pretty pathetic. It was large and roomy, but absolutely no snacks during the day (other than Yogurt), and no hot food (other than scrambled eggs). Most lounges have bacon or sausage, along with the eggs and a better selection of water and juices. I found this really disappointing.My second issue is with the gym. Again, there was nothing wrong per se, and there was a wonderful view, but a lot of the ellipticals were squeaking, and one felt shaky. I had to try three different ones, before finding one that was satisfactory. The gym was empty both times I went in, and so it wasn't a big deal, but for a premium NY hotel, they should take better care of the gym.My third issue with this hotel is with the full buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant. It would have been an acceptable breakfast for $15 or maybe even $20 (given that it's NYC), but at $32, it feel far short of my expectations. There was little in the way of fresh fruit (only strawberries, melon, and pineapple), the omelette and other hot foods were decent, but definitely not great, and the croissant was far from fresh baked. On the bright side, they had smoked salmon.The positives with this hotel are that I slept well, and the bed was very comfortable, but for a premium 4 star I expect a lot more. In the future, I will stay at either Fairfield Inn - Manhattan/Chelsea, or Fairfield Inn - Manhattan/Times Square, when I night to spend a night(s) in Manhattan.","Calgary, Canada","YYC4444</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",52,3.0

Not being familiar with which streets were safest to walk and cabs were not moving due to all the people even on the street, we opted for a pedicab (bicycle carts) to take us back to the hotel.

But it has it's own issues. This review is about the Marriott ES so I will stick to that. The rooms are nicely decorated. We stayed on the 36th floor and had a great view up Lexington Ave towards lower Manhattan. The room was larger than normal mostly because of my Marriott status. Even the bathroom wasnt to bad.

Cab Service is easy to get but NOTE: Getting cabs from here to the theatre district at play time in the evening in near to impossible!

The only con I had is that the room was loud. Alot of street noise, which I expect from NYC, but I thought it was really loud here. Maybe the windows are thinner or something. I would sacrifice quiet for large room, so I probably would not come back here since the other hotel where I usually stay is VERY quiet and that's just my personal preference. I will say, the people at this hotel (employees) are super nice. Everyone went out of their way to talk to me and my daughter. I was wondering if i resembled some celebrity or something. Like, maybe they are confused about who I am because they were trying to be so nice! Conciege was helpful when asked some questions.

It was the first trip to NY with my kids - ages six and three.For starters, I was upgraded to a larger room that accommodated two doubles and roll away. Said differently, we were not subjected to the kids beating each other up in the same bed until my wife and split up and each took one. This was accomplished with a pre-arrival e-mail exchange with reservation manager who was delightful.We arrived at around 11:30am and I was surprised to find our room available. Check-in was a breeze and I was shown all the love that my Platinumness is supposed to yield. The kids were thrilled when that evening when milk and cookies arrived shortly before bed (I was less thrilled, but that's more of a sugar issue).The room was large by NY standards. The view was of the center core of the building which was dark anyway you slice it. I would gleefully trade view for room size anytime (particularly when sharing a room with the kids) so this wasn't a big deal. And, not surprisingly, we were rarely in the room.The concierge lounge was among the busier ones I've seen in the Marriott system. Despite that, they were wonderful with the kids (offered a Marriott coloring book) and the breakfast offerings (eggs, bagels, cereal, fruit, good coffee) was more than good enough to save the $852 for four breakfast charge via room service (okay, slight exaggeration). Keep in mind that the lounge closes for the weekend at 1pm on Friday.Internet was more than good enough and the LCD TV kept my kids entertained when we were getting ready. The location at 49th and Lex was an easy walk to just about everything in midtown.Great stay and would (and will) return again in a heartbeat.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","verysnobbytraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",92,4.0

The room was average-sized...I've stayed in an similar-style Marriott in DC where the room was a tad bigger (even had a couch) but this is NYC so I expect smaller accommodations. When we arrived in the room we immediately did the bed-bug test (lift up the mattress to see if you see any critters scatter - bed bugs hate light) and it passed the test! Phew! The water-pressure in the shower was incredible, and they provided Bath and Body works toiletries (we also called down for a couple of toothbrushes and they provided them which was helpful).A few other notes... We didn't use the hotel WiFi as I believe it was $16 which seemed pretty pricey. We also skipped the hotel breakfast (also pricey) and the room service; however, my boyfriend did go down to the hotel bar/restaurant (525 LEX) where he had three beers and a plate of edamame for $50! (Yikes!) This hotel is conveniently within a block or so to some decent restaurants and bars (Ess-a-bagel, Starbucks, Dos Caminos, Snafu (dive bar that serves popcorn)) which was great in a pinch.

All in all - they did exceed their policies, which is great. But it just seems to me that some accomodation for those on early red-eye flights can be made, particularly if its someone with significant number of Marriott points.Any rate - the hotel is fine.

On the plus side, the hotel is conveniently located for anyone planning to explore NYC. I was also pleased with the bed, which provided sufficient support for people who get back pain if the mattress is too soft. On the minus side, the hotel feels like a throwback to the 20th century. I don't know when it was last renovated but the general look and feel is very *old*, from the lobby to the hotel rooms. I am not complaining about the small rooms because it's NYC after all. But the lighting (or rather lack thereof) -- with the exception of nice bed-mounted reading lights -- and a tiny window made me feel like a mole underground. The bathroom wallpapers and ceiling had lots of stains, and the shower was ancient and needed some serious recaulking. The A/C unit sounded like a subway train going by. None of that would surprise me at a Super 8 but from a Marriott I am expecting something nicer, even in New York. And my pet peeve: charging $17 for internet access on top of a $250+ room bill. Makes me mad.In summary, no big issues, wouldn't mind staying here again but wouldn't choose it on my own as a place I need to return to.","Sudbury, Massachusetts","mix579</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sudbury, Massachusetts</strong>",114,3.0

The check-in staff weren’t too friendly and neither was the concierge when we asked him some questions but the location is ideal for enjoying Manhattan Our room was on the smaller side but that is to be expected for NY city. It was clean and appeared to be recently refurbished. We were on a higher floor but as previous reviews have mentioned the street noise was somewhat of an issue. While I normally don’t mind street noise as I feel it’s part of the overall ambience and experience of a new place we were woken up on night two to the sounds of what sounded like a very serious argument on the street between two gangs. No reflection on the hotel other than being able to hear it clearly from a higher floor. We didn’t eat in the hotel as NY has so many choices. One night we did go to the hotel bar for a nightcap and the bar staff were very friendly and mixed us delicious martinis. To sum up – great location but don’t expect a very personal hotel experience from a big city hotel chain. The one suggestion I would make to people grabbing cabs from outside their hotels is to be wary of those “cars with drivers” that the doormen appear to push you towards. Unless you are in a major rush to get somewhere it’s just not worth the money. We were heading downtown and were waiting for a cab outside our hotel on the Saturday night, as were a lot of other people, the doormen were encouraging us to take the car service for $45 but we knew a cab couldn’t be more than $15 and we were enjoying the people watching so we declined and took the next cab – 5 mins later. Our cab cost us $12 and that was with getting caught at lights.

From the moment we arrived there we felt as though we were putting them out, and their go-to phrase the entire weekend seemed to be, 'there's nothing we can do'.My fiancé and I and a friend of ours stayed recently for the New Year's Eve weekend. We had booked far in advance through hotels.com (which we discovered later did not help us receive help when we arrived) for a room with two beds. We were immediately downgraded when we got there because families took precedence. They put three of us in a room with one king-sized bed and did not bring up the roll-away cot we were promised until FIVE phone calls and 24-hours later. Two men above six feet tall had to share a bed with another woman, also not exactly short. We found out after the fact that breakfast was not included as it usually is, nor was internet. When we asked if they could provide the internet in lieu of the inconvenience with room change, there was 'nothing they could do.' We purchased internet there for 24 hours at a rate of $17--and only received 7 hours use. Again, when we approached the front desk and explained, there was 'nothing they could do', but we were more than welcome to use the WiFi in their lobby for a fee of $7 per half hour, or something ridiculous.The following day, on New Year's Eve, we found discovered a glass of orange juice, to be brought to our room, was no less than $11.74. It cost $4 for someone to push a button and come up an elevator with the glass, and they expected a tip!The following morning, after they finally brought us a roll-away (too late) we were given our bill. They had charged us twice for internet use we were barely afforded, and a $3.50 occupancy fee, which was downright embarrassing. We phoned well ahead for the valet to bring us our car, clearing stating 11 30. When we were promptly at the front desk for the allotted time, to our surprise we were informed the car had actually been brought up for 11am and had been taken back.We complained to the front desk, at which time they blamed any inconveniences on the fact we had booked with hotels.com (essentially, they didn't get the cut they usually do at a high-traffic time of year and couldn't guarantee anything) though they still took $50 off our $120 parking fee because my fiancé was polite with his complaints.Overall, the experience with Marriott east side in no way ruined our trip, but was a complete let down. The best service I had there the entire time was from a bar-tender who didn't even work for the hotel.The location is great, and the newly renovated hotel is beautiful, but you're taking your chances with this one.","Grimsby, Canada","Marissa F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Grimsby, Canada</strong>",19,2.0

Get a room overlooking the street on the lower floors and there are chances that you may hear traffic, if you are a light sleeper.-This is a historic hotel for history buffs. Georgia O'Keefe, the famous American painter, lived here with her husband, Alfred Stieglitz, when the hotel was called The Shelton and created many of her well-known works here.The Minor Idiosynchracys-There are two sets of elevators.

There was no firm date for release so I had to book hotel rooms at the last moment. After staying at four hotels, I finally checked in to the Marriott East Side. I had a series of one night reservations so that I could cancel and leave with only a day notice (reservations required cancellation the day before arrival.) Some of the nights used Marriott Reward Points and some were paid. The stay extended into the weekend of the New York Marathon so hotels were full or very expensive.When I arrived at the Marriott East Side, all went well. Check-in was easy and I mentioned that I had a series of one night reservations. No problem or so I was told. My room was exactly what I had requested. Since this would be my home for the next several nights, I unpacked and was relieved that I’d not need to pack/move/unpack again. I had done that four days in a row and it gets old. As an elite member of Marriott Rewards, I enjoyed a visit to the Concierge Lounge before departing for the hospital to visit my friend. The next day, I returned in the afternoon from a hospital visit and found that my key no longer would open the door. I went to reception to get new keys and was informed I’d have to change rooms. At check-in they had forgotten to block me into the same room for all of my reservations. They had already blocked my room for another arriving guest so I had no choice but to move. I don’t know what they would have done if I had not returned until later that evening – my stuff was in the room. So, for a fifth day I packed and moved to a new room. Now the problem began. I could not get WiFi reception in the new room. I called and was connected to their technical support service who seemed to know about the problem. They said it was most likely the router on the floor and they’d have that reset. However, the next morning I still could not establish a connection to the Internet. In the hallway, I had no problem establishing connection but my room was a dead spot. On my way to the lounge, I saw another guest sitting in the hallway with his laptop so I’m guessing the problem occurs with more than one room. That’s inexcusable for a business hotel.I thought I would simply use the computers in the lounge or at least connect to WiFi while in the lounge. I then learned that the lounge would not be open after breakfast hours on Friday until Sunday evening. In other Marriott properties, you can at least access the lounge even if there are no other services available in the lounge. Not at this property! When the lounge is closed, no one can access the lounge. I asked about breakfast on weekends for elite guests and was told there was no option. That was a surprise and I learned a “loophole” in the Marriott Rewards program. If a hotel does not have a lounge, certain levels of elite members are given breakfast in the dining room. If the hotel has a lounge, you’re given access to the lounge instead. If they have a lounge but it is closed, you’re simply on your own for breakfast. After complaining, I was comped breakfast for the two days the lounge would be closed.I was very surprised to learn the lounge would be closed on the weekend. The hotel was sold out and they were charging premium prices due to the marathon. Seems to me this would have been a good weekend to keep the lounge open.Even though this is an older property, they do have the new Marriott beds and they were comfortable. Housekeeping did a decent job of cleaning the rooms. Water pressure and temperature in the shower did vary a bit during a shower but not enough to make me get out of the shower. There was very little counter space in the bathroom. Wake-up calls arrived on schedule. Overall, the hotel and rooms feel older, dated, and occasionally shabby. Internet service was spotty as mentioned above. Even when I tried using the wired computers in the lounge (when it was open), the response time was terribly slow. There frequently was a line at reception but my waits were not overly long.Maybe I was being overly critical because I was preoccupied with my friend’s hospitalization. My stay in New York had become unexpectedly extended and I really needed the Internet to keep up with issues at work. This was a time when I needed Marriott to come through and provide the services I’ve come to expect. Usually that happens, but it didn’t happen at the Marriott East Side.On Sunday (the day of the marathon), I was happy to check out and move next door to the new Hyatt Lex58 . But that’s another review….Overall, I was disappointed in the property, their handling of my reservations, and the awful state of Internet service in the hotel. I’d certainly encourage others to look elsewhere at this price point and in this neighborhood. There certainly are plenty of other options within several blocks.",Illinois,"Brian P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Illinois</strong>",118,3.0

Both properties were great, but this hotel is a NY classic. The Marriott East Side is a understanded darling of NY hotels, a mid-size property with a lot of history, especially if you like cats. A hotel from its inception, it was cared for by one family until it was converted to a Marriott. The rooms are ""old"" style with high ceilings and small dimensions, but what this property lacks in size, it has in character. Understand this is not the Marquis or Downtown Financial District Marriott, but it has charm and the lobby is beautiful. The rooms are adequete for couples or for a solo trip, would not recomend with a family. The bar is something you need to enjoy while on property and the location is top notch. Right in mid-town, the name East Side does not do it justice. Would have stayed all four nights, but the rate doubled half way through our visit. I was able to get a rate for less than 200 a night and this property for that price is worth it, better than most for that rate in NY. Historically the only full service Marriott in Manhattan Cheaper is the Financial District Property on weekends (sometimes $150.00).

The hotel staff is perfectly pleasant, and the rooms are more than adequate. In fact, if you know which room to ask for specifically (i.e., by number), you can snag some very special rooms as they have multiple layouts in this turn-of-the-century brick pile and some of the rooms are tiny, and some are huge. The check-in was fine and quick, and in fact the bell-hop was extra kind, holding an umbrella over my head and telling me, ""let me just make sure you're safe and dry and I will bring your suitcase in just a moment,"" which was a really pleasant way to be greeted.Reception lady was charming, and I got my preferred room, huge and very nice and clean. They've done some ""soft"" refurbishments, although the old furniture is still pretty much there.Access to the lounge was just fine, and I even had breakfast there. My only small ding, they give you hot scrambled eggs, but no bacon or sausage. Would it really be too much to ask for some breakfast meat? I mean, my corporate rate was over $400 a night so this is not a cheap hotel... Hmmm...Other small ding, the lobby concierge was gone by 8:30pm, which I think is a little harsh. I needed some help, and had to get it elsewhere. I'd expect longer hours from this property.Finally, lobby rennovations are going forward full-steam ahead. The lobby bar is now cut off from the lobby, and the lobby desk has been traumatized. I'm not really sure why a rennovation is necessary - it was absolutely fine and charming ""old school"" previously, and I really think they should have kept it the same way. This is probably due to some new young whippersnapper at corporate saying, ""let's see, we need to be more cutting-edge, let's re-do everything!"" Well, guess what, when you have something that works well, why tinker with it?I'll be back to this hotel, so I guess the rennovations won't scare me away.

Second, over the next few days we keep finding sewing needles and staples on our floor (was our room ever vacumed?).

Located close to many attractions, places to dine, shopping, and a safe part of the city.Rooms- I have good and bad things to say about the room.

Beds were extremely comfortable and I slept like a baby all night, despite the street noise, which I will get to in a minute.We had a long hall way to the bathroom, which added space and privacy, with marble countertops and an updated feel, plus an area for our closet that was generous. One other thing that always scores high points for me is the mini fridge, apparently in all rooms. Wireless worked great and is free for rewards members. Otherwise it was $17.Ok, the bad. The air conditioner was an old wall unit and it sucked. It worked good as far as producing cold air, but it was VERY annoying because it whined and rattled really loudly. So we had to shut it off at night to sleep, of course making the room stuffy. We called maintainence and he came while we were gone, but I saw little to no improvenent. Also I could hear the people next to us through the walls. Especially in the bathroom. The street noise can be loud...we faced Lexington and we were on the 18th floor. At times it was quite loud. So ask for an interior or high floor room and I'll bet you will be ok.Other than that...we had no issues.

The older kids were disappointed I hadn't booked a hotel directly in Times Square, but the weekend we went this was the only Marriott (or other comparable hotel for that matter) anywhere in Manhattan offering the government rate. Every other hotel was a minimum of $100-$150 more per night!! Check-in was quick and easy, and although we arrived at noon and planned to leave our bags at the desk while we began touring, our room was already ready and we were able to go up and settle in early. I didn't have to request this, either, and in my past experience most places will just not permit check-ins early, certainly not 3-4 hours early!The rooms were comfortable and though ours (with a king bed and a rollaway) was on the small side, the other room with two doubles was much roomier. The beds were very comfortable and I'm picky about beds. Everything was clean. Housekeeping was also very helpful and prompt for forgotten items or extra pillows.The location is perfect for visiting Rockefeller Center (easy walking distance) or Times Square (also walking distance but a bit further, probably 15 minutes or so -- unless it pours while you're there like it did for us and forces you into a cab instead!). Not staying in Times Square ended up being a HUGE blessing -- I haven't been there in many years but don't remember the absolute CRUSH of people we encountered there. It was so bad that you literally couldn't move on the sidewalks at certain points, and you just had to put your shoulder down and force your way through the loitering crowd.

It has been this way for months and NYC doesn't fix it so your are hearing it repetitively and it is loud even from higher floors. And of course you have the usual, constant horn beeping all day and night up until the wee hours when there is a reprieve. (I guess the cabbies must sleep sometime!) But that part you have to accept in NYC. The bedding was a bit much. The thick down comforter was way too warm for April. And without it all you had was a sheet otherwise. I did find a grubby blanket in a zippered bag in the closet to use. I hoped it was clean.The concierges were limited in materials on hand to hand out. Plus they were not very helpful and didn't seem to know enough to be able to help. They were good for getting train info though. The doormen never once opened a door for me over the course of 4 days!

I was on spring break from grad school so we all decided to take a trip to NYC for the weekend. My brother is a government employee so he was able to get us a discount and when we checked in we got ""upgraded"" to the same type of room but just with a better view. The room was nice but nothing too special. The bathroom was great. It had a long counter so we could unpack our things and it had a really nice countertop. The room was sort of like a bowling lane the way it was long but not very wide. We still had plenty of room for our 3 suitcases and we could easily put them out of the walkway. The beds were pretty comfy but one complaint about them was the comforter. We had a room with 2 double beds and the comforter on one of the beds was made for a twin.. Well this was an issue since we had 2 people sleeping in this bed under a tiny comforter. The odd thing was the other bed had a normal sized comforter so the 2nd night we made sure we switched comforters. One of the beds was right by the door and if you slept on that side you could hear people coming in at all times of the night talking in the hallway. We never heard any noise from our rooms on either side but sleeping right by the door you heard everything! The concierge was so helpful at this hotel! My mom and I wanted Italian food for dinner so we asked if he knew of a good place. He recommended this restaurant which was about a 5-10 min walk away and it was the best italian food we have ever had! He even called ahead to get us a reservation. We are already planning to go back here the next time we are in NYC. The location of this hotel is what made it fabulous!

The hotel is, like many buildings in NYC, an older one, but has been thoroughly renovated, with upscale appointments typical of Marriott properties in its class. The hotel's location is great for visitors bent on seeing the sites. When we booked the hotel, we were originally a little concerned that it was a little further from Rockefeller Center, Times Square and Central Park than we would like, as these were some of the primary sites we planned on visiting. We found that these were no more than a brisk 10-to-15 minute walk away, which turned out to be ideal. Further, subway stations are also nearby to go just about anywhere in the city, and we took advantage of these to travel up to the museum district and down to Battery Park, WTC, Chinatown, Little Italy, Chelsea and Herald Square.We stayed in a deluxe king room with a roll-away bed for our child on the 21st floor (thanks to Lucy, the front-desk clerk). There are only a few double bed rooms available, so you might want to be very specific regarding your needs. Also, a standard king room may not be big enough for a roll-away bed (which was the only thing that was of lesser quality and comfort, though adequate). There was a nice view of the Raddison hotel next door and the top of the Chrysler building from out windows. The room was very nice, with a comfortable king bed and other typical ammenities. The room had a very nice, clean bathroom, with plenty of hot water.

He was asked to hold which took almost 5 minutes and then was transferred to a manager named Veronica. He explained our situation and what our room should have been and was met with denials, lack of sympathy, and down right rudeness.

The hotel is very smart and the rooms quite luxurious. We had great views from our corner room and not too much street noise on the 24th floor. However, the air con system is quite noisy and we found it necessary to turn it off to get a good nights sleep. Our most recent visit was marred by a mix up in the booking as they only had us reserved for two nights - we had booked and pre-paid for four nights through an agent in London. The desk man made no attempt to be helpful and merely said that the sytem had us for two nights even though I presented him with the pre-paid voucher. Fortunately the London agent had provided us with a 24 hour contact in New York and one phone call by me sorted it out. After a long transatlantic trip it would have been nice if the hotel had taken the initiative to make the call, but it was left to me - Yes they had charged me for the call when I came to check out.

It's an older hotel, but has been recently renovated to match the true Marriott style and comfort. From the moment you walk into the lobby until you get to your room, the hotel is luxurious, and beautiful. The staff is WONDERFUL!!!

In 12 years of business travel, this has never happened to me before, so I can't rely on this hotel from now on. That said, my room was ok, clean and comfortable. The front bar is a bit cold and lonely - the other hotels around would have been better options for a drink/bite to eat, especially the W hotel, which is probably where I'll book next time.","Vancouver, BC","totocas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, BC</strong>",6,2.0

On arrival we didn't have to queue to check in and although our allocated room was nice and clean, it was very dark as we were directly facing a brick wall. I rang reception to ask if it was possible to move to a different room as it was a special holiday for us and we really wanted a room with a view. This was no problem and we were allocated a corner room on the 8th floor, it was so much bigger and brighter than the first room, so if you don't like your room for whatever reason it may be worth asking to move.The location of the hotel is good, about 15 minutes walk to Times Square. However, we did find the resturants were more expensive as we were staying in more of a business area than a tourist area but this was fine as I felt the service at the hotel was better because of this and we soon found some good places to eat within a short walking distance. There was also a shop nearby called Duane & Reade which sells snacks, drinks etc and there is also a Starbucks within just a couple of minutes walk. I wouldn't recommend buying anything from the hotel shop as this was very expensive.We found an Irish bar called O'Neills (about a ten minute walk from the hotel) which was really nice, the staff made us feel very welcome. One night they had live Irish music so if you like this kind of thing then it's well worth a visit. We also ate there one day for lunch and the portions were so big I didn't need anything to eat for the rest of the day! Good prices too.We ate in Ruth Chris' Steak House one night which is just off Times Square - highly recommended. You also decide on the tip you want to leave as this isn't added onto the bill like many places do. The staff at the hotel were more than happy to book this for us and arranged a cab for us too.We did all the usual tourist things and found it very easy and safe to travel around on the Subway but as the weather was so nice while we were there, it was nice to walk as often as possible as the hotel was in such a good location to Grand Central Station, Public Library, Central Park, Fifth Ave etc.When we left the hotel arranged a taxi for us to take us to JFK Airport, this was a huge private 4X4 type vehicle and was much more comfortable and cleaner then the yellow cabs. The price quoted was $55 including tolls and tip which was really good value and we would definately use this service again. We were also able to use the internet service free of charge in the Business Centre to check-in for our flights.Overall this was a great hotel in a fantastic location with top class service and we would definately consider staying here again.",England,"saml0ves2travel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>England</strong>",43,5.0

Let me start by saying that I got an e-mail from the hotel about 3 days before our trip indicating that because they had a full house the night before we arrived, they weren't sure if they could meet our request of an early check in, and if they did they wouldn't guarantee the room type we wanted. So we had a plan to spend some time touring the city in the late morning/early afternoon in the expectation that we would not have access to the room, only to find they had upgraded us, provided a nicer room in the same type we had requested, and given us the early checkin we had wanted. So the staff was dealing aces from the very beginning and the rest of our stay was also great. Aside from the location which is close to everything in midtown and easy access to the subway, the next best thing about the hotel was a reasonable rate, particularly the deal we got for a 3 night weekend stay. In fact the only complaint of any kind that we had concerned a unexpected smell of cigarette smoke that seeped into our room around 10pm on the last night of our stay. It seemed to be coming in through the vent in the bathroom, which led me to believe that another guest was smoking in their bathroom even though the entire hotel is supposed to be non-smoking. We smelled it again in the morning so I reported it to the front desk upon checkout. Other than that random occurance, we had no complaints and would stay here again on a future trip to NYC.",Alabama,"sellinrain</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alabama</strong>",30,4.0

We've stayed at the other two Marriott hotels (Marquis, Renaissance) but decided to go for the East Side Marriott this time. It proved to be a right choice. Things like at this hotel:-quiet location (compared to the hussle and bussle of Times Square)-walking distance to everywhere (15 min to Times Square, TKS booth, 20 min to Broadway theatres, 35 min to Lincoln center and theatres, 10 min walk to numerous restaurants and cafes/deli, 10 min to 5th Ave shopping and American Girl store)-clean hotel room, marble bathroom-large guest room (we had a king, plus roll away bed, still have room to walk )-quick check out (check in took longer with some guests jumping the line)Things disliked:-very small lobby, it can get noisy when the lobby bar is openMy two cents on getting around/things to do:-there's a garage parking right on 48th st, the same block where the hotel is, $54/24 hrs. We parked there and just walked around the corner into the hotel lobby.-Liberty Deli Cafe on 49th St. (2 blocks west from hotel) offers good varieties of food/drinks with good prices. The meals are sold by portions not by weight. For our family of 2 adults 2 kids it cost $18 for dinner, including drinks. -Shin Wong Chinese restaurant on 48th about 4 blocks to the West has the most authentic Chinese food around Times Square. We had 3 dishes for dinner for $23. Their soup noodle with wonton is very very good. We had 3 meals there and saw local people eat there too.-Variety Deli and Cafe almost next to Shing Wong is not so good. Food is not so fresh. They sell food by weight so a box of lunch can be more expensive than you thought.We walked to all the theatres of the shows we saw on this trip.---the good: Phantom of the Opera (good as always), The 39 Steps (very good comedy), South Pacific (good musical)---the bad: THe Gazillion Bubble Show (totally not worth the money in my opinion, even my 5 yr old was not thrilled, and we were sitting in 2nd row)Overall, we like the Marriott NY East and would love to stay here again.",PA,"rachel2006</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>PA</strong>",32,5.0

We also asked for two beds, and again, no problem. The entire place was very well kept and clean. Only a couple of issues, two minor and one major. First the minor - the elevators are small and slow. It was nearly impossilbe to take the elevator down, as they were always packed. My husband and son walked down and I took the elevator with my other children. Some people were getting very angry as they had reservations to eat, and we waited for more than four elevators before we could get down. There was also a problem with the bathroom because they don't have fans. In the morning when I took a shower the fire alarm went off and scared the heck out of me. The hot water was also limited. We were on the sixth floor and it was too close to the street so we heard noise the entire night. I would recommend requesting a high floor. The biggest problem we had with this hotel was the comfort of the beds - they were terrible (very hard.) The linens were soft, but the bed itself was extremely uncomfortable.

We arrived late in the evening and were checked in with speed. Although our room was on the 3rd floor with no view to speak of, we were in New York to sight see, and time in the room was for sleeping only, so it wasn't a problem. After hearing about the small size of rooms in NY, were were very pleasantly surprised by the room size. There was plenty of floor space. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean, and the bed comfy.We chose not to eat in the hotel, as it was expensive, but there's quite a few places nearby. The location is fab, only 5 mins walk to Grand Central Station, and less than half an hour to the Empire State Building and Times Square.The hotel provide a computer in the lobby to do internet check in for your flight home, and as the computer was in use, we were quickly escorted up to the business suite to save us time.One negative is that on the morning of our check out, we had an invoice under the door for charges to our room that we hadn't spent. Although not a lot, when we queried what this was on check out, without even looking at the invoice, reception told us it was a mistake and we wouldn't be charged - a bit strange.But overall, for the price we paid, this was an excellent hotel!",UK,"Jayney79</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>UK</strong>",21,4.0

I didn't have a chance to try the food but there doesn't seem to be anything resembling an actual separate bar. In the corner of the lobby, you can sit at the stick and order drinks but it feels like....well.....the lobby. Front desk staff were okay but overworked and not very helpful in that midtown tourist hotel way. Again, the weak dollar and strong Euro is filling the city with people who don't really speak enough English to travel in North America. But they do have the money!! Good proximity to most major midtown attractions and you're on the Lexington Ave. Subway line which is great for tourism.",life,"danielglak</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>life</strong>",27,3.0

I was a bit hesitant staying on Lexington Ave as on previous trips to NYC I have always stayed close to Times Square, but it was the best location ever. The hotel is located less than 5 minutes walk from 5th Ave and less than 10 minutes walk from Times Square. The staff were very friendly and efficient especially the Irish Porter from Donegal. He was so pleasant and helpful. We had room service one night as we could not walk any more after our day shopping. The food and service was great and only cost $70 for dinner for two with beer and tea included. Never again will I stay in hotels close to Times Square, I'll be staying in the Marriott. The concierge was great and organised a 'town car' for us to go the airport in and it only cost $75 including tolls and tips - again this is the cheapest fare we have ever paid to the airport from a hotel in NYC. This is my seventh trip to NYC and would have to say the best trip ever by far and this was all down to the fantastic hotel that I stayed in. I'll be back!",Dublin,"Ado37</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin</strong>",11,5.0
