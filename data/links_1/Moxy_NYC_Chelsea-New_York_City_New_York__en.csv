I was always curious about the Moxy brand also working at Marriott and the hotel lived up to my expectations of it being aimed towards Millenials (like myself) but also fitting the budget. The hotel itself was in the perfect location as it was a close walk to the subway stations and felt like a safe area. There's even a flower shop next door which is nice to walk out to in the morning. I absolutely loved the aesthetic of the hotel, and even the staff's uniform was so stylish! All the staff I encountered at the front desk were super friendly, including Maria and a few others I forgot the names of.The rooms are small but what do you expect in New York? You should also be minimally in the room and exploring anyhow! I stayed in a King room the first night and it was the first time I've seen a sink in the same area as the bedroom; I could see this as an issue if you are staying with someone and need to blowdry your hair while someone else is sleeping. However, this is not an issue in the double-bedded rooms so keep that in mind (the whole bathroom area is behind a closed-door versus in same room as the bedroom). Other than that, I loved the aesthetic and also loved how there was a steamer in the room. Another heads up, walls seem thin and I could constantly hear the neighbors talking or doors slamming in the hallway. The rooftop bar was also lovely! I went on a Saturday night and it was packed; expect long lines for the bar and pricey beverages. However, you can't beat the atmosphere and those views. I also visited the Moxy Times Square bar but I preferred how this one was much more classy.Overall, I really loved my stay at the Moxy NYC Chelsea and will absolutely recommend to anyone traveling to NYC. I'm dreaming about the next time I can return and stay there again!","San Jose, California","Cris-annL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",3,5.0

The location is decent and centrally located. However, what made my stay enjoyable were the employees. Every single one of them was great and they always had smiles on their faces. Great customer service and they certainly ensured that my days got off to a good start.

I booked the Moxy Chelsea having read it was recommended for its fantastic views of the city and rooftop bar. Well it didn’t disappoint! We had a great view downtown from the 30th floor which we enjoyed waking up to and watching the city go by at night. The rooftop bar - Fleur Room was a nice treat too with some great views. The rooms were small, but just about the right size. Everything worked and we didn’t miss the extra space - very high quality. The location was good for getting around by subway with the 1-2-3 line stopping at 28th on the corner. The street is known as the flower district which was great to walk through on a sunny morning. I couldn’t recommend this hotel and it’s friendly staff more. ",,Breffni G,1,5.0

We were visiting for my daughter’s 21st birthday and the hotel provided a great room on the 29th floor with a wonderful view of the Empire State Building. They left balloons and decorated our window. All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and accommodating. We ate at Feroce and it was delicious. We also went up to The Fleur Room for a great view of the city. We liked that the hotel was centrally located between Uptown and Downtown because we went all over.

Starting with the reservations. We each booked separately using different methods and all got excellent rates and rooms ( booking.com, Amex travel, and hotels.com) . Before arriving, as I was somewhat hosting this get together, I inquired about getting an early checkin. I also requested a mini refrigerator,. There is no charge for that. You just have to request. They explained to me what to do to increase the likelihood of getting early check in. We had a very early morning flight and wished to change clothes and clean up a bit before heading out sightseeing. They made a note on each of our rooms that we would like early check in. I was told to call a number they gave me when we were in route from the airport. We did that and 2 of our rooms were ready early ( like 10:30 ish). There was a 3rd room available provided she switch from a king bed to 2 doubles which she did. The staff at the front desk was fantastic and check in was a breeze. When we were leaving they gave us clear concise information about our request related to taking the subway to the Brooklyn Bridge, including information on how to we could now use Apple Pay for the subway instead of needing a metro card. ( not all stations can do that yet). Our rooms..small and tight ( fine for 1 -2people)with amazing views. The design was really different than anyplace I’d been, but very efficiently laid out for use of space. My room had a king bed and the mini refrigerator arrived about 5 minutes after I got to the room. As you enter the bathroom is on yours right in a divided space with sliders like you might see on a double closet. One half has the commode and the other side is the shower. On the left as you enter is a full length mirror followed by a very modern sleek sink /vanity area with mirror above and open wrought shelving below that was stocked with towels and a blow dryer AND garment steamer. Ample plugs in the area for small appliances &/or phone. So probably the biggest difference from a typical hotel room was no closet or dressers or tables ( except 2 small night tables on both sides of bed). Attached the the wall was a pull down table/desk. Pretty cool. When you opened it on the back we’re fabric pockets for stuff like pens, phone , note pad , maybe even a tablet, and the table top is a good size. Plenty of room for a laptop and working papers beside, and again several outlets. A folding chair is hanging flush on one of the MANY pegs around the room. The pegs and provided hangers replaced a need for a closet. I actually loved this. I could put my outfits for the week including accessories on the pegs and visibly see them all laid out. I didn’t even bother with the hangers as the pegs were big enough ( subtle time saver hanging/unhanging ) . Not a big deal for most but I have a handicap with one hand and hanging clothes isn’t always simple for me. Under the bed are built ins that replace the need for dresser. Hanging on the peg is a foldout luggage table or you can store your luggage under the bed. I loved the efficient room features, including the many outlets and overall design. Easily worked for me. Now the food and drinks... every morning (7am-11am)free coffee on the 2nd floor ( no coffee maker in room). There is also a coffee shop at entrance to hotel with delicious coffee. Food looked good but I didn’t get to try any. There is a happy hour 5-7 with certain drinks being half price which is still expensive for this Florida girl. But this is NYC and I fully expected this. The drinks I tried each time were delicious and unique. I believe the Peroni beer was the happy hour beer the day we were there. The service was excellent. One night after a day of sightseeing we were to tired and just ate the tapas type food at the bar which was absolutely delicious, some chicken tenders type thing, an amazing grilled cheese type thing, truffle popcorn and these were not your normal versions of this stuff . I just can’t recall the other ingredients or sauce. We didn’t eat at the restaurant since we had dinner plans the other nights. It sure smelled good though whenever we were nearby. The rooftop bar was a lot of fun. Terrific views of the city all around, including getting to see the Empire State Building light show . It is an enclosed ( not open air garden type) bar. Monday not crowded at all. Tuesday night was rainy so it was definitely busier, but not bad. The crowd seemed to primarily be young to middle age professionals. The music was good but not so loud to make conversations difficult. We loved that we could just be at our hotel for after dinner socializing and just go to our room downstairs when we were ready to call it a night. A big reason for selecting this hotel. The other reason we selected this hotel is that we wanted to be in a different area of the city. In this case in the Chelsea area not far from Chelsea market and the High line. Walking distance to a lot of things and easy access to the subways. It is in the flower district and the flowers in the shops by the hotel are breathtaking. Location was perfect for us.","Apollo Beach, Florida","Kimkrankin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Apollo Beach, Florida</strong>",4,5.0

Perfect. This hotel seemed to offer a lot as well and just seemed to fit the bill for the area. Upon check in, I was expecting a complimentary cocktail since they advertised (and still do) that it’s an amenity. We were told it was discontinued and didn’t bother to grandfather us into the rule. Ok. Then I had them my bags after they said our room was not ready, they don’t take our luggage! I had to go down to the basement, where it smelled of curry to take my luggage and store it myself. Finally got our room and omg. It was SMALL! It’s seriously goes from lobby: ok, decor kinda fun but strange. Then the hallways look like an industrial bowling ally. Then you get to your room that looks like it’s from a small cottage in northern Michigan. Camp for adults it felt. Yuck.

While the room is on the smaller side (hello NYC), it’s well designed with spaces under the bed for storage, floor to ceiling windows to allow for brightness and a perception of space, and a beautiful ceramic full length sink that doubles as a shelf for your things. The hotels cool design and great location in the center of the city was a nice touch. But it’s the shower that really made the room standout. From the full coverage of the rainforest shower head to the large walk in tiled flooring to the fully enclosed space with an almost closet style sliding door, the shower turns into a steam room of sorts that allows for the experience to be fully immersive and relaxing.

The lobby was modern and chic and the check-in process as well as luggage storage was very easy. One of the most outstanding parts of my stay was the service provided by every employee I interacted with at Moxy NYC Chelsea. They were all helpful, friendly, and kind. The decor was fantastic as well, my room was comfortable and cozy with a nice view. I adore the bathroom finishes so much, I recently inquired to have similar ones put in my home. There was one small hiccup when the fire alarms in the building went off late at night, causing the whole building to evacuate, but the situation was handled very well by staff and it was remedied quickly.

Moxy (from Marriott) seems to have the formula down, but it's important to note what works well, and what doesn't (for families, at least--- perhaps we're not the target demographic, but it's still a good option for all kinds of travelers.)The rooms are small but well designed. Also, the hotel is new, so that helps--- I'm not so sure some of the design details are durable enough to age well, but we'll see. (Our shower leaked into the toilet area every day, but we jammed extra towels at the bottom and it worked fine to prevent water from spreading.) I think one of the draws is that it seems like the vast majority of rooms have great views. It's something like 35 stories, with decent air space around it, so I think almost everyone gets something. We were in an 8th floor room--- the quad bed bunk rooms only go from 4th to 12th floor, something we didn't know in advance--- but still, it had a nice sliver of a view of the Empire State Building. I'd want to be in the 20's if I had my choice of floors.The location was fantastic for us. Moxy is on a small, flower district street along with Hyatt House, Hilton Garden Inn, Cambria Hotel, and Hotel Hayden. The street is relatively quiet, and Moxy's new construction made it even quieter. Though only on the 8th floor, we rarely heard any street noise except when we opened our window (yes! it opens!). It's also a treat to have plants and flowers lining almost the entire block. There were multiple 28th Street options for subway stations depending on where we were headed. And we also walked everywhere to eat, from Flatiron (Eataly!) to Gramercy Park/Union Square, to Tribeca. Super convenient.The hotel has its quirks. Not a lot of service around. When we needed it, we were able to get attention and service, but there's just not a lot of staff around. There is no lobby to speak of. I like lounging in hotel lobbies, especially when waiting for the rest of my family, but there's really nowhere to wait here except the 2nd floor, which is sort of removed from the entrance and gets a night-clubby vibe in the evenings and night. That vibe is ever present from the ridiculously dark, black-painted elevator lobby to the elevators themselves, with it's black button panel that had more than one person shining their iPhone on to see which floor to push. Just silly--- contemporary style doesn't have to be this difficult.The silliness extends to the stunning ""rooftop"" sky lounge (aka, Fleur Room) which is inexplicably only open in the evenings into the wee hours of the morning. In other words, it's operated as a ""club"" accessible to 21+ guests and other trend-seekers off the street. So my kids couldn't even visit the lounge to check out the incredible views of the Empire State Building and NYC skyline. I asked the front desk for 5 minutes so my kids to see it, but they replied that the space was operated by a promoter so they had no discretion to let anyone visit the space.So Moxy has that nightclub side to it, for better or worse, but it's still a place I'd stay again. The rooms, while small, are thoughtfully designed. Our room had four beds (two bunk beds) that enabled our kids to have some private space. It worked. All the hooks/knobs to hang things were essential; there was just enough space for the four of us on a six-night stay. I'd prefer having some extra space to sit, or write at a desk, but we did just fine without it. The room rates are a bargain for what you get. It's quiet, the mattresses are excellent, and the place is super clean. Housekeeping was very good.The gym was small but seemed sufficient for this size hotel. It was never crowded. There's also a small business center where I printed some show tickets without issue. Moxy Chelsea provides a lot of value in a clean, quiet, and well-designed setting. Sure, I'm not a fan of the nightclub feel, but other than that it's an excellent choice for a midtown hotel. Highly recommended.","South Pasadena, California","TravelDrone</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Pasadena, California</strong>",199,4.0

From check-in to departure, everyone at the Moxy was incredibly helpful and pleasant to deal with! The hotel is beautiful and it was a place we very much enjoyed coming back to at the end of a long day. We attempted to do the Times Square thing for NYE and that was a little more than what we wanted to deal with so we decided to come back to the Moxy and figure out how we wanted to spend NYE. They had a really nice NYE party happening on the 2nd floor with a DJ so we decided to get dressed and attend that. I’m glad we did! It was a lively party with great drinks and friendly people all around and it was a perfect way to ring in the new year! We stayed in a quad bunk room which was PERFECT for our situation. My boys don’t like sleeping with each other and I don’t like sleeping with them either - LOL so each of us having our own, ridiculously comfortable bed was really ideal. We had a fantastic view of the Empire State Building from our room. The room was small but somehow they put it together so efficiently that it seemed very roomy! They don’t waste space at the Moxy. Whoever space planned this place is a genius! The mattresses were incredible, the sheets and comforters were plush and comfortable and the linens were top notch. The rain head shower head made it hard to take a quick shower because you want to stay underneath it all day! The area that the hotel is in is ideal. The 1 train is at the end of the block which makes it super easy to get just about anywhere. There is a Dunkin Donuts right across the street - my fave coffee spot in the morning (although the hotel does offer free coffee at the 2nd floor bar from I think 7am - 11am. The lobby and the whole hotel for that matter smells clean and inviting. I can go on and on about how wonderful our stay was. We couldn’t have enjoyed the hotel more! If there was one thing I’d change, it’s the location of the tv in the room. We were hardly in the room as we stayed out just about all day but when we were in the room, the tv was hard to watch from the top bunks. It’s mounted on the wall just below the long row of hanging hooks which doesn’t make a whole lot of sense because you are pretty much unable to use the hooks above the tv because whatever’s hanging there will cover the tv. If the tv was mounted above the hooks, you’d still be able to see it from the bottom bunks, you’d be able to see it much better from the top bunks and you’d also not have a section of useless hooks above the tv. Again, wonderful hotel with wonderful staff in a wonderful neighborhood. We’ll definitely be back some day and we’re already counting down the days!",,Robsos,8,5.0

Everyone seemed overwhelmed or just not interested in being the face of the hotel . Room ( king bed ) - perfect for solo travelers with very little luggage. In my opinion it’s way too small for 2+ people with any luggage larger than carry on sizes. There is no storage for cloths , only hooks to hang your cloths and the hooks are attached to the walls of the room. 2nd Floor Bar - the best group of employees in the entire building are working at this bar. Specifically Christian who make excellent drinks. Roof top bar- unfortunately it was closed on the first night and too busy the second night for us to make it up. Elevators - super slow in peak times . Plan accordingly . Give yourself extra time getting to the lobby. Ambiance - not as refined as the pictures look online and they are going for a younger , hip crowd with the decor. Location - love the location!

The guest rooms are the size of a basic bedroom in a modest home but with no furniture. There is no closet to hang your dresses or suit coats. There are no drawers to empty your luggage in, there isn’t even a luggage rack to set your suitcase on but just as well because there would be no room for it. The rooms are so tiny and cramped that you are provided with a folding table and one chair that is hanging on the wall. No frills, no robe, make up mirror, just a basic bedroom. We asked for a bigger room and were told “they’re all the same size.” This little room is great for a one-night stand because you wouldn’t have room for a suitcase.

Got an excellent and very reasonable rate, and somehow, a view of the Empire State Building from our room! The hotel is located on 28th, just before 6th Ave - fantastic central location, a hearbeat from every form of transportation. The rooms are small (with minimal storage) but well designed with huge windows. The separation of toilet/shower/sink is brilliant and works perfectly. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and we slept like logs. Most important to me as I am a light sleeper, we heard zero noise from any other room, either adjacent or above us - can't say I have ever had this experience in NYC. Perhaps this is due to the solid concrete construction of every part of this hotel.(There is of course, some street noise). In terms of amenities, this hotel also knocked it out of the park for us, with 3 different restaurants - all very nice, super bar, a roof top lounge (separate managment), a gym, luggage storage and then just myriad spaces for working or conversations. The Conservatory space on the south side is just lovely. All the staff was extremely polite and helpful. Seriously, there is so much to love about this hotel - we thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our stay.

Definitely visually appealing, no doubt about that. Also a good service recovery experience (although too bad I had to find out...)The room: folks aren't kidding when they say it is small. I am glad I am staying here alone, and for only one night, and even that feels cramped. I'm pretty tidy and have only a carry-on; there is stuff EVERYWHERE! No closet and nowhere to put your suitcase. There is what appears to be a table and folding chair hanging up but I can't imagine where in the world you are supposed to put them. Not complaints, more of just observation. Also the bathroom privacy is rapidly approaching ZERO; I would never stay here with more than one person in the room even if it is someone you are close to.I had called the hotel a few hours prior to arrival to inquire about room service or carry-out. (Flight very delayed, tired, maybe just want to get some food and go to bed.) This is when I started to wonder about the hotel... I'd tried the ""chat"" function on Marriott Bonvoy app a few times, not working. I called the hotel and pressed 2 for dining. It rang, and rang, and rang. I called back and pressed 5 for ""anything else"" and spoke to a young lady who informed me about the lack of room service and told me that carry out was only allowed from one of the restaurants, Le Fleur. I asked where to find a menu (as there wasn't one on the app and I wanted to perhaps call an order in ahead of time.) She said to check the webpage. There isn't a menu on the webpage because LE FLEUR IS A NIGHTCLUB. (Also they are closed on Sundays which was the day of the week I was here.) Hmm, sounds like she did not know what she was talking about.Check-in experience was fine. Went to the pizza/bar area on 2nd floor. Wanted to sit at a bar as traveling alone. Inquired if pizza was served in the bar and the hostess told me that ""I know it sounds weird but the way you do it here is you order the pizza to go and then you take it to the bar..."" OK, she answered quick enough and confidently enough that clearly this is asked a lot. So I ordered a pizza and went to the bar to get a seat and tell them my plans. Then they politely informed me that it is not allowed... they grabbed a manager (why? I don't know. Either it is allowed or it is not; I don't want a special exception or to break the rules.) He was also polite and offered to make a one time exception but I was told that the ""brands"" of the pizza and bar were separate. I don't want to be ""that person"" so I left and cancelled the pizza order. But why is one person telling me to do something directly in opposition to the other? (The pizza and bar are basically across from each other, direct line of sight.)So I went downstairs, told the front desk the story so they could perhaps help advise the restaurant staff better for next time, and went to the restaurant.This was the first good thing that happened. I'll leave a separate review when I have time, but suffice to say the time-honored tradition of solo hotel guests dining solo at a bar was in full force. The front desk offered me a credit toward my meal for my trouble (which was very kind) and I ended up enjoying the evening.At 0715 the ""7am"" coffee service was just being set up by a surly young man who refused to even return my ""good morning"". When I let him know the half and half (sitting next to the coffee pot) was empty he curtly responded ""that's because I haven't had time to fill it up yet."" I travel to this area fairly frequently but will probably not be returning to this hotel. Maybe they are just too new to have gotten their ducks in a row, but I am not sure I want to find out.","Daytona Beach, Florida","The_Dylaness</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Daytona Beach, Florida</strong>",111,3.0

This hotel is very different to your usual Marriott, you like something cool and funky, this is it. You won’t be wowed by the small rooms or tight spaces, but if you like something fun, then stay here. Check-in was easy, they are very polite and a different way to greet you, such as howdy and what’s going on! The hotel only has 4 lifts covering all 30+ floors which can be troublesome if you are on a high floor. The rooms are very clean, TV, no alarm clocks, sink in the bedroom, shower and toilet is just a glass cubicle and no wardrobe (hangers on the wall) and nowhere to store luggage case, no desk, just a small fold away round table big enough for one and a small foldaway chair. I was by myself so it was just about ok, for two? No way. All very off putting when you first stay here, until you get used to the space, it grows on you, but not the wardrobe. Breakfast can be bought next door, in a cool place, however very pricey for what it is, drinks and free morning coffee at the bar on the second floor which is a great area to meet and greet but staff are grumpy. Head to the roof top bar, friendly staff, great vibe, well worth a visit and free entry for hotel guests although it isn’t part of the hotel. So overall, if you want to stay in Chelsea for pleasure and your by yourself for close to the person you’re staying with (literally) then worth it, if you are hear on business or if you like space, stay somewhere else.","London, United Kingdom","509keegand</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",131,4.0

Two people will struggle. The design is spectacular, the architects/decor team thought about every single detail, from the color of the old fashioned telephone matching the sink to the unique hook system in lieu of having a closet. The shelves and safe location (below the bed) was super uncomfortable. The water pressure was great and the quality of the mattress superb, we rested well. There was no fridge in the room but the hotel provided one, which turned out to be the only item in the room that didn't match the decor. Now that's the design part. Let's talk about function. The shower and toilet are housed separately in two tiny, compact adjacent spaces. Only a sliding door with a frosted glass separates them from the room. That means, if you're traveling with a partner or friend, you better ask them (or be asked) to ""go take a walk"" so the other ""can do their thing"" because there is no privacy at all. Next, water spills from the shower into the room! We had to use several towels to stop the water pouring into the room. Maintenance installed a tape to prevent the outflow but as you can see in the pic the solution does not work well because the tape hit the adjacent toilet wall (the same sliding door structure opens both spaces) and ripped. The sink is tiny and does not collect water making it difficult to shave. There are no vents in the toilet room so any unpleasant smell propagates into the room. We also experienced problems with the electrical wiring as the same switch on the table lamps turns on the sink area fluorescent light making it uncomfortable for a companion if he/she is sleeping.","Seattle, Washington","boolz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",60,3.0

I called the front desk at 1230 am my first night looking for a feather pillow and the staff informed me they only had foam. On day 2 I went and spent 50 bucks on a pillow that was feather only to find out at check out they did, allegedly, have feather pillows. The standard pillows are 5"" foam and possibly the worst most uncomfortable hotel pillows I've experienced in 20 years of business travel. Awful.The room at conditioning couldn't be set below 68 and I like to sleep below 65 so that stunk. It was down into the 50s at night, arguably cool enough to open a window at night, problem is you're letting the sounds of NYC in with you. The floor to ceiling windows were amazing but I didn't get one good night's sleep between the pillows and the hard bed. I stayed alone but the shower toilet setup is odd with sliding doors and the sink out in the main sleeping area - I didn't hate it but even in my international travel haven't ever seen a room setup like this. No room for a desk or even a table so ordering in dinner was eaten in bed.The hotel sits on 28th Street and several floral wholesalers are established there so walking to the subway was really beautiful. And the 1 train is only a block away. As a titanium Marriott guest, I was given a slip of 'perks' with my room key like free in room water, but there wasn't even a bottle of water to pay for in my room. Mobile key check in didn't work though I requested it through the app 10 hours before check in. Overall just a lot of hassle and effort to get what I felt were the basics, when I could even get that.

I loved the delightful city views from my 29th floor room, which felt both hip and spacious. The bed was super comfy and the waterfall shower was perfectly roomy and refreshing. I had ample sink and count space for all of my bathroom ammenities, makeup, and hair items. Check in was quick and painless, and staff was very friendly. Excellent location in the city - it was a super easy jumping point for my wedding dress appointments in Chelsea the following day.For areas of improvement, the lack of separate closet space might be less ideal for longer stays, but the hangers along the wall worked out well for my one night. It also wasn't clear to me if there was room service available from the linked restaurants or not, which would have been nice with my later arrival from the airport, and without any fridge/mini-bar (although, I can't complain about the lack of fridge noise overnight).Overall, a great deal for my Marriott points, and would be more than happy to return!","Helsinki, Finland","bebergman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Helsinki, Finland</strong>",2,5.0

Luckily, fate and a last-minute deal brought us together. File this hotel under “essential” when you want to travel NY stylishly without paying a fortune. Let’s start with arrival. To get to check in you walk through a flower shop. Cool and unexpected. Then you’re greeted by someone really nice and helpful. In my case, it was Claudia who hooked me up with a great room (3001 for those who care) with a view. Not only that, I’d arrived early with a 40 pound pack on my back and she got me into the room. Relief and gratitude ensued. Throughout my stay I’d see her and she’d check in on my stay. Friendly. Professional. And went beyond the call of duty. Great first impression. Oh, and they give you a complimentary glass of Prosecco. Now let’s talk about the space. Yes, the rooms are NY-standard small. But the clever design maximizes the space and make it a pleasure. I’m stealing the hang-on-a-peg solution. It works. The real lobby is a beautifully designed 2nd floor divvied up into atrium with plenty of work spaces (with hidden outlets), a bar, and a pizzeria. I took full advantage of the first two spots and never felt like I was trapped in a hotel. The gym is surprisingly well stocked. I’d like to see the cable fly machine repaired and a couple of Pelotons added, but otherwise it’s great for its size. Dumbbells: check. The attached restaurant Feroce is a legit trattoria. Ate three meals here which is ridiculous in a town full of restaurants. There’s also a rooftop bar which I didn’t check out but sounds like a great amenity. Overall, this had everything I needed as a business traveler (including a great common work space) and a few things I didn’t know I’d love so much (like a Negroni menu). Nice work, team.

The location is extremely central with several different subway lines a short distance away. It's far enough from 42nd St and the core of midtown to not be terribly crowded with tourists. Additionally, there are an abundance of nice coffee shops, juice shops, bakeries, etc., to make it extremely convenient for grab and go options. The room is small, but very clever with storage solutions and very well designed. We had a great view on the 22nd floor. We also had drinks several times at the hotel bar with good service. One negative, I asked for a hair dryer several times and never received one. You would think it would be somewhat standard issue for a hotel room. Every time you walk out you are surrounded by cut flowers and plants since the hotel is situated in NYC's flower district. It's really nice to stop and smell the roses before you head out to work or play.

The room efficiently designed, but very tiny. There was barely any room to lay out my carry on suite case. On the first night my husband fell ill and wanted some hot water to take some meds. There is no coffee maker in the room so I called the front desk. Rather than offering to deliver the hot water the front desk suggested that I go to the second floor bar. I had to get out of bed and change so I can make my way to the bar. Based on this, I just assumed that the hotel doesn't offer any service to your room. However, on our departure day I called the front desk to inquire about the ice machine. I was told that ice is only available by delivery to your room.

She’s fresh hip new and comfy. My 17 year old and 15 year definitely were impressed that I didn’t book an average twin bed hotel room. The moxy is where you want to be. The rooms are NY apartment size. Loved the decor and furniture. The Tv was a great size. Awesome feeling to watch a movie and turn to look out side and see the paradise of lights from the other buildings. Views for days. The hotel has a restaurant. Front desk staff was so nice and welcoming! the staff throughout the hotel was so helpful. If you book in NY expect fees to park the car. Expect to wait for elevators. Do not be unrealistic. In the night hours the hotel bar is a scene for the locals so it feels busy but it does not effect the hotel. The hotel is very well managed. From the restaurant to way up to the top. The only area of the hotel that I felt needed some attention from management was the cafe. The wait staff is stressed. They ran out of cups to sell iced coffee. When breakfast food came out the waitress did not know who the food went to. The plates were dancing around from table to table. On a different occasion I opted for a hot macchiato it was not executed correctly. I was upset because Starbucks is just a block or two down the street. Then in the afternoon there’s a person that stands in the bathroom that is in between the restaurant and cafe. The person is there with a tray of money & You feel obligated to tip!

No others to sit or stand,Well done well throughout, until they get to that one other item, the bed. To the design team, you completely failed. To address there are eight inch drawers under the platform that was a bed like thing on it, so if you are willing to get down on the floor and stuff things where no room light can reach and then sleep on a bed which at the vest is 16 inches from the ground, the coolest part any movement causes the bed to slide off the smooth Platform.

I LOVE the Chelsea area and I frequent NYC alot for work so I have been everywhere. Chelsea is quieter than some of the other areas of NYC and I love the flower district. This hotel is within walking distance of Penn Station/MSG, Macy's, etc. There are plenty of restaurant and bar options in the area. So, the room:Pros:comfortable bed, great shower/water pressure, it was quiet! No street noise. I didn't hear my neighbors. Staff were super friendly and helpful. This hotel opened Feb 2019 so everything was fresh/new. My room 1708 - had a great view of the ESB.Cons:No refrigerator and no ice machines - you have to request ice. The room is SMALL. If I had someone with me - it would have been very tight. We would have been competing for space and if you have a large suitcase - yeah - that would take up a lot of space in the room. One garbage can in the toilet stall - and that's literally what it is. A stall with a toilet and sliding door . Fine for just me (weird though if you leave the door open you have a full view of yourself in the full length mirror across from you). Shower - same - shower stall - nice products to use (shampoo/shower gel and conditioner). but the door slides - which was fine. Fire alarm at 1:45 - I was so disoriented I didn't know what was going on at first. I inquired the next morning about it and they said that sometimes the ""steam"" from the shower sets them off - that's not good. Oh and the bar in the hotel apparently gets a lot of business from outside customers. It had a night club feel - i wasn't comfortable going in there alone so I forfeited my wooden coin for free champagne that . you get upon check-in. Roof top bar was closed for a private event which was fine with me because I wouldn't have gone anyway. oh and lastly the room was clean overall, but there were multiple ""hairs"" that were not mine on the floor, shower, bed, and toilet. It was a little icky. I would stay here again, but it wouldn't be my choice if my husband was with me. It was too tight.",Albany,"cab1002</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Albany</strong>",66,4.0

Small but beautiful front lobby bordering a boutique flower shop that you walk through to gain entry. Great 2nd floor bar and 1st floor cafe for breakfast. The free Sparkling wine chips to use at the 2nd floor bar and given upon check-in is a nice bonus. The rooftop bar which is managed by a seperate company, while not open air, has one of the best 360 views in the city. Bedrooms are flawless though extremely small so be prepared. If your not familiar with the Moxy concept, no closet exist so you hang your clothes on the wall. Small cubbies exist under the bed for folded clothes. Amazingly well designed and comfortable bed directly across a huge flat panel TV in every room. I'm a fan of the clean and warm colored fake wood floors and well designed furnishings, not the bare bones Ikea look used at similar minimalist hotels. The Moxy splurges with its bathroom finish outs which include products that are almost as good as what you would expect at W Hotels. Front desk staff is pleasant and helpful with zero attitude.

I got a standard king room to share with my cousin for one night(we're in our 20's and 30's). I've stayed at some hotels in the Chelsea area, as well as other parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Things I did like:- The hotel is easy to find and in the flower district. If you're there early enough, you can check out all the gorgeous flowers. - I found nearby parking to house the car for 24 hrs for a lot less than the hotel charges, you can just search on spothero or parking panda- We were able to store our backpacks in the baggage room on the C level of the hotel. Much better than lugging them around until check in.- I checked in and out on my iphone through the Marriott Bonvoy app. I was able to request more towels and pillows through the app. Super convenient and I was able to ""Check in"" around 2 and my room was ready around 3. You can do it remotely without being at the hotel and the app alerted me when my room was ready. You use your phone as the key. - The bed was super comfortable Things I really didn't like, so much so that I won't go back:- thin walls. I heard a gaggle of girls outside our room at all the time shouting and laughing. I'm not sure even if they were in the hall or the room next to us. - not enough elevators and they're slow. Plus, you have to use your ""key""(in this instance, my phone key) to get to your floor and its hit or miss with the elevator touch key pad. - the 4th floor was loud, dark and had an office building directly across(from the looks through the windows, office is a guess). Do you want to keep the curtain open? You're going to show your bits to the neighbors across the way. - I was aware of the bathroom situation, or so I thought. I knew there were barn doors with frosted glass and that the sink is outside of those spaces in the room. The pain in the neck is: If you want any shred of privacy you'll be hard pressed to find it. If you want to disrobe in the shower, there are no hooks at all. You have to open the door and drop your clothes on the floor. There's nowhere to hold a towel so you again have to slide the door and get it off the floor. Then you have to get dressed in the shower without getting your clothes wet from the floor. This is a ridiculous, awkward design unless you love being naked with whomever you're rooming with. - In the shower there's two pump bottles on the wall: conditioner and hand soap. Yes, it says HAND SOAP. I used the app to request shampoo, he brought more HAND SOAP. I have color treated hair so I'm not going to just slap anything in it to wash it. After a stupidly hot day walking around, this was very frustrating. I didn't bring any hair washing products because I've never encountered a hotel without shampoo. - No complimentary anything. There's Fiji water in the room (5 bucks a bottle). No coffee maker. No small toiletries. No fridge. No microwave.- The room price fluctuates greatly and there's no price guarantee unless you catch the difference within 24 hours. I don't like the gambling factor of cost fluctuations. There's no Marriott member loyalty to adjust the cost. I think overall this hotel is designed for aesthetics, not for common sense use. People say ""unique"" but I think hotels like this in the area are a dime a dozen. They're all trying to be cool but lacking the functionality. The bathroom in the room is annoying with a bad design. While I appreciate the use and convenience of the app for certain things, its very impersonal. The only person I spoke to was to ask about where to store bags and she wasn't welcoming or friendly.",Connecticut,"ABoston14</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Connecticut</strong>",11,3.0

The rooms are creatively designed and include some fun features to take advantage of it's NYC sized rooms. The staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed in a front of the building on the 22nd floor and had relatively quiet evenings-this also gave us some nice city views. We would stay in this flower district location again.

But I feel like even for that crowd, this hotel has some challenges. At $500/night, I was surprised this is no bell service. They give you a cart and you go it alone. We used valet parking--although they try their best, given the very narrow and congested street they are on, the valet parking situation is super chaotic. It took us over 35 minutes to get our car. On the positive side, the restaurant on the ground floor is great--beautiful, good services, good food. The lounge on the 2nd floor was also perfect for our purposes. We had a big group so we just grabbed a large table in the corner and ordered a ton of very tasty pizzas. There was a cute indoor bocce table to use. Service at the restaurants and front desk were quite good, and they do manage well in a very chaotic/demanding/loud environment. The rooms are super spartan and very small. I felt somewhat like I was camping, as little folding chairs/tables are hung from pegs on the walls, etc. However, my kids thought the room was great as it was quite different from the 5 star properties we were staying at elsewhere in NYC. The view from the room was great. But the sink is a metal stand right next to the front door. Noise did not seem to be an issue--we had neither street noise nor noise from surrounding rooms even though I believe the hotel was nearly full. We were disappointed not to be able to enjoy the rooftop bar as they do not allow under 21 up there, even hotel guests. There was massive confusion in the morning as we called down to ask what breakfast options were, and they told us either the rooftop bar or 2nd floor. We tried to get to the rooftop bar by elevator but housekeeping told us the elevators were broken and not able to go all the way up, so they directed us to the services stairs, which were dark and weird. Of course when we got to the roof, staff told us breakfast hasn't been served up there in a really long time, and directed us to the ground floor. Anyway, I'm sure if you're looking for a fun scene and not worried about amenities or parking, that this could be a very enjoyable property. For me, at that rate, I was just expecting nicer rooms and more full service.",,momtraveler88,2,3.0

Firstly, the hotel has just opened at the beginning of the year, so everything was nice and new, but no signs of any teething issues. The hotel is located in the Flower District in Chelsea, so central to pretty much everything. The hotel is unique and cool on every level, not too big either. I loved the coffee shop on the ground level and the guys working there remembered my order and name which was really special. The 2nd floor bar is great to visit any time of day. It’s such a beautiful space, so great to have delicious pizza for lunch and drinks at night. It also has a great work space, perfect for catching up on any business matters etc. Again, the staff were friendly and efficient. The Fleur Room, top floor rooftop bar, boasting 360 degree views of NY, is sensational. The decor is stunning and it also houses a unique disco ball that once hung in the infamous Vertigo Club in LA in the day. The Feroce restaurant on the ground floor is a brilliant, buzzing venue, serving delicious Italian cuisine. I actually celebrated my birthday here with a group of friends and had a great night.My room, a city view corner room was great. I had expansive views of Downtown and New Jersey. I spent endless hours just staring out of the floor to ceiling windows when I woke in the morning. The rooms are compact, there’s no denying that, but the layout has been carefully and cleverly designed to make the most of every bit of space. The bed was so comfortable and I slept really well. There is a great fold up table and chair that hangs on the wall when not needed. There isn’t a wardrobe, but, but there are lots of hooks on the wall with coat hangers. I needed more and they were delivered within 5 minutes. There is also some storage under the bed. If two people were staying in the room with big suitcases, it could get tricky. The shower was lovely and large, but the vanity was in the actual room. There was plenty of space under the vanity which I used to stow my luggage. The only thing I missed initially was coffee making facilities and a mini fridge. I do like to have a coffee upon waking, but I soon got used to grabbing one in the cafe. Personally I didn’t need a fridge as I was out all the time anyway. I mentioned this to the staff and they advised me they were looking into different options. Overall, the room was perfect for me, very comfortable, clean and beautifully furnished.I would really like to compliment all the staff. From Paul the Captain, who took care of my reservation before my arrival to the all the front desk guys, especially Christian, Danny and Marvin. They made me feel so welcome and special, assisted me when needed and were always up for a chat. I have to say a special thank you to Christian. On the day of my birthday, when I was out, he wrote birthday greetings on my room window and knowing I was having pre-dinner birthday drinks with friends on the 2nd floor bar before dining at Feroce, he left me drink chips so I could shout my friends a drink. Now that was special! It made my day.I can not recommend this hotel enough. Thank you to all the Moxy Crew for making my stay wonderful! I can’t wait to come back!

I was delighted to see that Marriott is getting into the Boutique Hotel scene. CHECKINThe ""lobby"" is discrete, and hidden behind a lovely flower cart that you walk thru in the foyer. Walk toward the yellow neon sign, and that is where you checkin. The attendant upgraded my room to a high floor (floor 25) in a Wheel Chair access room, so my room ended up being HUGE. I was given a wooden token to claim a happy hour drink for free in the lobby bar which was a very nice touch!ROOMMy room was supremely well designed and cleaned. It was equipped with a wall of accessories from a laptop table, to a luggage stand..etc. The vanity was a ""farm sink"" just inside the door. The beds were comfortable, however my room was terrible hot both nights-- I think the A/C was not working well, making it very hard to sleep.BATHROOMThe bathroom was in a separate room and was HUGE (because it was handicapped access). It had a large soaking tub, tiled with cute words like ""get wild"". All of the hardware was matte black. Very chic. FACILITIESThere is a lovely lobby bar on the second floor that you can claim your free welcome drink at. There is also a rooftop bar that I was unfortunately unable to visit- it seems to access the rooftop you must go thru the cafe on the bottom floor/entrance.The location is not what I would necessarily call Chelsea proper. It's more like Koreatown, which is totally fine.

Only minor things we could fault during our stay was that the rooftop bar accidently charged our card twice for cocktails we had there but we didn't notice until the next day and didn't know how to approach it so left it. Also the housekeeping hadn't filled up the bodywash when doing the rooms so we ended up leaving a note to try and get more and they had missed filling up the bottled water after we consumed one (which cost $5 per bottle) so by the time housekeeping came again the next day they charged us again so by the end of the trip a few extra bottles were added on.

I was very pleasantly surprised on all counts. Check-in was quick and friendly. Yes, the room is small (almost all rooms in NYC are small!), but it's laid out very nicely. There's not a closet, but for a couple of nights stay there is ample room to hang your clothes on the wall with the hangers they provide. The bed was extremely comfortable - probably the highlight of the stay. As ""small"" as the room is, the shower is very spacious! While there's not a desk, they have a little table and chair that folds up and hangs on the wall. I never thought I would be able to use it comfortably, but again, I was wrong. The breakfast cafe was very good, and their 2nd floor bar was great to do some work in the morning where it is set up more like a coffee bar.

Easy subway access and much within walking distance. The staff was exceptionally nice, the room was very clean and attractive, the bed was very comfortable, and the price is moderately reasonable. The rooftop bar is stunning (although does not allow anyone under 21, so my teenagers could not enjoy the view). For a hotel of this small size, I thought it had a good number of nice amenities as well. We had a king bed, and I thought the layout of the tiny room was ingenious: the sink was in the bedroom and the toilet and shower had separate sliding doors (frosted glass) that opened right into the room. I loved the use of space, however, it is not much for privacy. Some might find this off-putting. My only complaint was that for myself AND my traveling companions in a different room there were never enough towels. We were shortchanged the day of arrival, housekeeping took those towels and didn't replace any the second day, and the third day we were back to being one towel shy. The fourth day they left us with extra! They were always happy to supply more when I asked, I just think there staff on my floor was a bit confused. Also, my friends sink drained slowly, and after reporting it and being assured that it would be fixed, it never was.

We travel as a family, with our two children of 20 and 15 years, and decided to book a room with 2 double beds. We got a room on the 30th floor, with an amazing, breathtaking view. The room is small. We travel only with hand luggage, so small suitcases, but there is no place to store them. So you have to put them somewhere and the are in the way because of the size of the room. There are no closets, to store you can use the draws underneath the beds and you also can hang lots of your things on the big coat rack, left and right from the lcd tv. The beds are lovely, and how convenient to have wall-plugs with charges. So no need to bring your own plug-in.The shower is spacious and has great shampoo and conditioner. Smells delicious! Even the time waiting for the elevator is nice, with good music on the background.The rooftop bar is beautiful but the kids weren't allowed, unfortunately, it is a club for 21+.

We had 5 big luggages and it was quite a struggle having to lug them from the car to the reception area and into the rooms cause the person serving you at the reception, is unfortunately also the same guy bringing the luggages to the room. And because the rooms are compact, unpacking requires a degree of thoughtfulness cause you will walk into things lying around carelessly given that tiny space.Toilets are segregated away from the room by a mere frosted glass and you can actually see the silhouette of the person sitting at the toilet bowl doing his/her thang and I am guessing it might be quite an uncomfortable sight if you are sharing room with a friend/colleague. Side from that, Moxy spots a very sophisticated interior aced with a bar that looks incredible both in the day and in the night.

However, it’s quite new, is fresh and clean, with great service and a nice gym with good potential that isn’t realized just yet.The queen bedroom has a great view on the correct side of the hotel, but on the incorrect side, your window opens up to another building right in your face. Not a huge deal, but it’s worth requesting the front side of the hotel. The bathroom is divided into a water closet and a shower, and both are a nice size for a New York hotel. Although the overall room size is cramped, it’s not terrible, especially given the fact that the property is newer. One small detail I appreciated, and this might sound strange, but in many hotels with worn sheets and bedding, I have rolled over in the night and ended up with a small abrasion on my elbow from sheets that, over time, have ended up with a bit of a sand paper effect. This even happens at nice properties, of the 3.5-4-star variety. Not the case at the Moxy Chelsea – the property is new enough to not have worn sheets!I did not use the restaurant, but it’s not a full-service place, from what I could tell – light meals/drinks only. There’s a nice bar on the 2nd floor, and the gym and office area, as well as the luggage check is in the basement. The gym is pretty spacious for a hotel, and there is standard equipment for a gym of this type, but it looks like the planning wasn’t ideal. There is quite a bit of wasted wall and floor space where a kettlebell rack, or perhaps a squat rack, could be placed. I hope the Moxy has plans to expand their equipment because it would be great if the Chelsea had things like kettlebells – you’ll find these in the Times Square property.Overall, a nice, hip and trendy property. It’s a good place for most vacationers/partiers, and decent for business – fairly versatile. I would return since it’s newer than the Times Square version but needs some additional improvements.","Atlanta, Georgia","phiNole</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",127,4.0

Another disappointing thing was when we checked out and asked for a taxi, we were told that since the hotel had its own driving service, they would not order a taxi, needless to say that the hotel service is twice more expensive than a taxi, so we had to go out to the street with all the suitcases and try to catch a NY cab ourself. We had the same problem with the hotel parking service, the crew refused to help us when we asked about the nearby parking lots, and we had to use the expensive hotel's parking service.

If you like flowers, you'll enjoy walking around the block of the hotel as all the wholesale flower shops line the sidewalks with their colorful sweet smelling living beauties. There are many other hotels on the same block but I'm a Marriott brand loyalty member so I chose to stay at my first Moxy hotel. There is a 1 local train stop on the other side of the block and a R W local stop one block over the other way which was convenient when I wasn't walking or car share riding. I drove into Manhattan with my own car and lucked out finding free street parking not in a hotel loading zone after 7 pm on the block of the hotel which is metered M-F for commercial vehicles only . Despite arriving after 7 o'clock in the evening, my room was not ready. But I chose to accept tokens for a couple free glasses of prosecco and $30 towards food at Bar Feroce on the second floor. When the room was ready, thankfully it was very clean. I stayed in a room with 2 beds on the 22nd floor (no view of the Empire State Building) but pleasantly way from both the rooftop lounge and street noise. There really is not a lot of space in the room. I did assemble the table hanging from one of the hooks on the wall to rest my suitcase and I could still get by it to get to the side of the bed nearest the window. There are bedside nightstands to rest your phone, curtains to block the sun, full length mirror, storage under the beds for shoes, big screen tv, telephone, laptop tray. The bathroom was a comfortable size and it has a sliding door. I found the beds comfortable and slept well. Only 2 of the elevators in the lobby go down to the gym level and parking garage so there were lines for the elevators at busy times. It was also another small annoyance there was no door man at all times because the front doors to the hotel weren't motion-sensor opening. It was a nice perk to have a caffe to grab my morning coffee/tea, a bar (DJ unitl 1 am on Saturdays), a lounge (before 9 pm), a restaurant, and a flower stall all right there in the same building. In addition, the hotel/bar/cafe staff were friendly and provide great service.

I have been coming to New York for over 30 years and this was by far the smallest room I ever had. Not only that, but the room smelled terrible which is surprising that since it is only a few months old. It already smells moldy from having the bathroom in the same room and poor ventilation. I had to go out and buy a candle to make the room smell better. On top of that when the air-conditioner kicks in it makes this long humming noise for about three or four minutes. I asked about the noise and the engineer came up and said that there is nothing they can do about it that all the rooms air-conditioners make this noise and that it’s some type of issue that can’t be fixed. I asked for ear plugs and of course I never got those either. Unfortunately there’s no room service either and don’t expect moisturizer because the toiletries are very limited. I’ve requested moisturizer but they don’t have any so I had to go out and buy some as well. I have been traveling for 40 years and have never seen a hotel without toiletries that includes moisturizer. I understand that this brand “” Moxy” Is trying to appeal to millennial’s but It just felt cheap to me. I didn’t appreciate calling the front desk and every time they answer they say “hey . what’s going on” I felt like it I was “hostel chic” themed hotel. The worst part is this hotel is expensive and not worth the price. For the same price I could have stayed at much better hotels. It’s a good thing I was in the hotel alone.

We also got a friendly visit from the manager. The ambiance was lovely, and even at full capacity, the restaurant managed not to be deafening (as many in NYC are). I even encountered a wine on the menu that I hadn't seen anywhere since my trip to Tuscany. Many of the various meal components were imported from Italy and/or were the product of apprenticeships with a prominent Italian culinary family who spent time in New York mentoring the restaurant staff. Additionally, the hotel had a beautiful view of the skyline from its swanky rooftop bar, supposedly one of the highest rooftop bars in Manhattan. A very memorable experience all around!

Best thing is walking out of the hotel and in the middle of flowers and greenery in the urban landscape since it's in the Flower District.As far as the hotel is concerned, Danny at the front desk was very helpful and nice making checkin and checkout process pleasant. The second floor bar are is great to meet for drinks or hanging out with friends. Rooms are expectedly small but new and clean and the view of The Empire State building is fantastic. Slight inconvenience due to the grand opening which closed off the roof deck bar and had a different line entrance for hotel guests.Few niggles, the shower door, which is a double sliding door to the toilet, leaks onto the floor and I for-see issues in the near future. Gap in the room door allowed sound to travel from the halls which also opens right into the side of the sink making it awkward to roll in with bags. Mind you there is no closet space but hooks along the side of the room sufficed for a single traveler. The only desk/workspace is a foldable chair and table that are hung on the fore-mentioned hooks. If you need to do any type of work, you may need to go to the bar area. The bag check, unfortunately is in the basement and the only way to get down a floor is the elevators which seemed to take awhile to get down and back up again.

Great start to the trip!The room was very small but we knew this before based on the website and reviews in Tripadvisor. Very clean and tidy on arrival and a welcome retreat after a long journey. The soundproofing was adequate considering the bustle of the city below us.Housekeeping throughout the week was sporadic at best. Beds made, but bed linen not changed frequently and even the water glasses (plastic jars) weren’t replaced with fresh ones in a daily basis.The rooftop bar has amazing views of the city, but it’s enclosed and the drinks menu limited. Seems to be a place to be seen more than anything else - style over substance. The bar on the 2nd floor was excellent - great service and good selection of drinks and bites to eat - we really liked this space.The adjacent coffee shop - Ferocce is worth going to. Great, but pricey coffee and lovely breakfast items and pastries. The boys on the coffee bar were cracking and their chat excellent.Staying here for a week allowed us to see the good and bad of the hotel. Staff were a hit or a miss - quality of service dependant in who you spoke to (Claudia was the standout and most helpful and customer focussed out of them all - she just gets it). The elevators were very frustrating especially at the weekends where non-residents are going to the rooftop bar - very long waits and poorly managed. The hotel staff seemed to want to cater more for the bar customers needs and wants as opposed to paying hotel guests...The hotels opening party was on the during our last night at the hotel. We weren’t informed of this on booking nor at check in. We had a letter slid under the door the morning of the party to advise us of potential disruption. Needless to say, the staff were more focussed on the party than the guests. Getting entry to the hotel was cumbersome and took ages - got to look after the b list celebrities it would appear!!Overall, it’s a shiny new hotel with lots of plus points. The rooms, although new, have a few design flaws - shower leaks into floor of room and adjacent toilet for example. Bed too close to the wall and limited space to walk past it. The WiFi is solid and very fast, so this was another plus point.The location is amazing though with easy access to the subway and so many of NYC’s main attractions are within walking distance. 5 mins and you are at Maddison Square Gardens for the basketball for example.Marketed and designed clearly for Millenials - it’s worth a stay but I’d only come back if my trip was for up to 3 nights maximum.","West Calder, United Kingdom","SteveM6113</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Calder, United Kingdom</strong>",12,4.0

I can live with that but there are some significant detractors from the stay quality. The room is tiny, there is a pop out table and compact chair that is best suited for a dorm room. They have these folded and on the wall so you may not even notice it. Theres barely any place to put them and its not comfortable. So if you intend to do some work while staying there its a challenge. The sink is also in the bed room which further cramps things. The hvac system was off during my stay- meaning it was putting warm humid air in while I wanted the AC on. No bath towels were in the room when I checked in. Last, a serious issue for hotel with 35 stories is the lack of working elevators, there were just two available the night I checked in. One was giving access to the night club rather than guests so that was unavailable. Another elevator was on and off use and staff use them as well so be prepared to wait a while. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. I didnt make much use of the common area on the second floor. Gym was decent but too warm, it is a challenge to get to the gym because there was only one working elevator that went to the basement during much of my stay.I wish I liked the hotel more, it be fine to just sleep in but given the rates (and yes IM aware this is Manhattan) I expected more value and the ability to comfortably get some work done in my room. Also not much value for Marriott elites, no upgrade and a token which is good for 10 dollars at the bar- that doesnt get you much at the prices they charge there.","New York City, New York","flipper95</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",134,3.0

It was small but clean and location seems to be good. However, I’m a bit disappointed as I have high expectations. It seems to lack compassion. One of the guests had an accident, has to cut the holiday short, like half of the nights, as they needed to fly back home for in order to go through a surgery because of the accident. We have asked if we can recover the costs of the unstayed nights because of the unfortunate incident that no one ever wanted to happened. I understand that you have policies and cancellation procedures and it’s not your fault that the accident happened. However accidents happens and it’s beyond the control of everyone. But perhaps rather than sticking to your policy, in unfortunate events like this where you can gather evidence and see that the situation they claim is indeed genuine and not just to rip you off and not requesting because they just don’t like it there, you can perhaps make a consideration on exceptional circumstances. I’m also not saying that you agree to every request of the guest, but severity needs to be considered. Especially if it’s in the matter of life. We just did not request because we want to, but because it is a necessity. And if we stayed longer to get the value of our money because your policy does not allow refunds, the guest could be paralysed.We travel and understand hotel policies.

I liked the vibe of the hotel. They carried the local florist nature of the street throughout the hotel common areas from the entrance to the rooftop. Staff was great—very friendly, fun, and engaging (both desk and bartender). Public areas designed well with good vibe. BUT seemed to lack outlets in the areas you would want them when hanging out working on your laptop in the 2nd floor lounge.Room. Well designed room. Didn’t mind that there was no closet with just open hooks and hangers. Would be nice to have a drawer or two available...a bit weird hanging my underwear, socks, and T-shirt’s on hooks instead of throwing in a drawer. Shower doors look good but don’t work well...water leaked out into toilet room floor and room floor whenever used (even briefly). They need to stock room with more than one towel, as mine had to serve dual purpose to dry myself then dry the floor. Bedding. This was the worst part. I’ve stayed at nearly all Starwood and Marriott types of hotels, and the bed was the most uncomforable. Mattress was a bit hard and lumpy and sheets were scratchy but nothing unbearable. But the pillows were some sort of poly fill that doesn’t compress at all when you put your head on it. I had to put head against the hard lumpy mattress instead and the pillow was so uncomforable. I almost called the front desk after an hour of trying to sleep to see if they have softer or down pillows available (which they may have). I was glad I wasn’t staying for more than one night. But the staff, cleanliness, and design and decor made up for the shortcomings enough to give it a three star rating.","Chicago, IL","Fishiv</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, IL</strong>",23,3.0

Lots of food options nearby as well, including the caffè and restaurant downstairs, and the rooftop bar is so gorgeous and ornate with some of the best views in the city.

Each day the staff promised that the bar would be available for the residents of the hotel, but by the time it was supposed to open there had been a sudden change of plans which would make it unaccessible. They also tried kicking us out of the hotel in the middle of our stay, because the owners wanted to ”suddenly” host a 1200 person party. No attempt by the staff to try to make up for this. The shower closet leaks so that the toilet area and the room itself is covered in water. My worst experience at a Marriott Hotel so far.

Couldn't tell you anything about the place other than the address. So why one star? Seems pretty harsh, huh?I am a Marriott Bonvoy Platinum member, which means, I spend way too much time in their properties and generally, I have a very positive opinion of the brand. I also have a a lot of points, so when my wife, teenage daughter, and some family friends were planning an overnight in NYC to see a concert, I was more than happy to cash in points for two rooms. At least on the website, the Moxy looked like a cool new property near the Hammerstein Ballroom, so I reserved rooms for Thursday night. Everyone was really excited for the trip, that is, until they arrived.My wife and crew arrived and were informed that there weren't any rooms available for them, and the hotel wasn't exactly fully open. How about that one? Was this a surprise to management that people were going to show for a reservation? I don't work in this industry, but seems like pretty easy math. Could they have not worked this out in advance, rebooked them into another Marriott property prior to arrival? So they booked them in to the Moxy Times Square, and transferred points back in to my account, which was nice, but did they think to arrange transportation for 3 moms and their daughters? Did I mention, we aren't from NYC and they don't know their way around the city? The answer is ""Nope"", they just gave them the address and sent them on their merry way.I would like to say this story got better, but it didn't. Tomorrow I will post a review of Moxy Times Square.

They decorated our bathroom mirror with Christmas lights and a personalized birthday message for my boyfriend. They put us on the 27th floor with an AMAZING view of the city!

Whenever we entered and exited the hotel we were greeted with a smile and someone on the staff was always asking how our stay was going, or if we needed anything — from the concierge at the front door, to housekeeping, to the gentlemen riding the elevators at night; there was always a genuine concern that everything was good! Saying goodbye felt like we were leaving our new found family! The staff said we would be missed which is exactly how my boyfriend and I both felt about them!
