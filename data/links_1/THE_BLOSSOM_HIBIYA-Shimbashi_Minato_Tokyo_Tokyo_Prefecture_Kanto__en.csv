Would be nice to warm up food that you buy from convenience and grocery stores. Need closet space in smaller rooms. Would be nice to have refillable container for shampoo, conditioner and body wash rather than having those small containers, it will be great for the environment. MANY Pros First: Location, Location, Location!!!! 3 minute walk from Shimbashi Station with at least 4 lines including the mostly used Yamanote line (even has an indoor underground access across the street to avoid rain), 3 minute walk to Ginza (2 blocks or just cross the train tracks) about 4 blocks to the street where they close the famous High End shop street on Sundays, Donki Ginza is 5 minutes walk, countless combinis (even have Lawson on second floor) Ichi**n, the famous ramen shop is just accross the Shimbashi station and the upscale version of the ramen place in Ginza is also few blocks aways. So much food option around the area! Second: Hotel Staff. They are the most accommodating staff especially the tall European young guy who's always ready to greet and so friendly. The cleaning ladies are very friendly as well. I've visited Japan every year and most cleaning staff are very timid when a foreigner approach them but the The Blossom Hibiya staff are very courteous and polite and ready to help. Third: The room, we booked a corner room Deluxe Double. The highlight of the room is definitely the gorgeous view and the automatic window blinds that could even sync to the alarm clock! Everything is being controlled in a side table tablet! Room is always clean (kudos to the staff), the firmness of the bed is just right! My husband and I also appreciated the 2 daily complimentary bottled water, wine opener, high quality wine and water glasses, not a huge fan of the UCC coffee maker (coffee was awful), I think you guys should change that to Nespresso. I also appreciate the daily tea! All and all, We found a new hotel that my husband and I will go regularly, we used to go to this high rise hotel in Shinagawa for the past 6 years but this hotel definitely impressed us. So much food option around! Two of my favorite desert Osaka's Pablo and Hokkaido's LeTao cheesecake is inside the station!!! We are definitely going back! I apologize if my review can be incomprehensible but hope the readers will get my point. ahahahah","Anchorage, Alaska","HookedOnPlanes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anchorage, Alaska</strong>",10,5.0

This new hotel in Shimbashi has everything you need within walking distance. Plenty of restaurants and bars , Shimbashi gets very lively in the night and is about 10mins walk to Ginza for great shopping too. Train station is around the corner so is easy to get around everywhere you want to be. All the rooms has great views of the city, is clean, spacious by Japan standards with a decent size bathroom that fit comfortably for most westerner. This hotels ticks all the boxes for sure; Location, accessibility, affordability and amenities.

It is new and modern. The lobby is on the 25th floor with the rooms above that. You do need to do the two elevator shuffle to get to your room. The room was nicely furnished, and had a nice essentials in the bathroom - though the bathroom is on the small side. Buffet breakfast had a lot of options, but lunch/dinner is Japanese food only. We had a view of Tokyo Tower from our room, it is walking distance to Shimbashi Station and multiple subway stations. We were also able to walk to the Imperial Palace.

The hotel is newly built and very nice, modern. The location is amazing as it is only a 2 mins walk to the station. Rooms are quite small so there is not lots of space for two big luggages and literally only a few (6) hangers but it does the job. Other than that rooms are modern as well and have a quite cool view over the neighborhood which itself is super close to Ginza. It is also only a 5 mins walk to Ginza (Chuo street with all the brand shops and lots of good restaurants). Breakfast is only Japanese so you need to like or get to used it but good. As we stayed there again on our way back so definitely recommend it.  ","Zurich, Switzerland","RHZRH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Zurich, Switzerland</strong>",22,5.0

This is a brand new hotel near Shimbashi Station. It's not a luxury hotel but everything is clean, functional and the room was a good size. The location is convenient for getting round and there are limitless restaurants nearby. I'd have given 4 stars but the room we stayed was close to Shimbashi Station and it was quite noisy. The train noise starts around 4:30am and won't stop until nearly 1am. I was woken up several times each night even with earplugs. After the first night, I asked for a different room but was told, ""every room is noisy"" by a front desk staff. I think they just didn't want to bother with a move as one end of the hotel where our room was is much closer to the station than the other end. For guests who were staying for 4 nights, they should have given another room. If (a big IF) I ever go back to this hotel I'd definitely have to ask for a room far away from Shimbashi Station.",Tokyo and California,"Shibuyakko</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo and California</strong>",120,3.0

Room is very modern and relatively spacious. The hotel staff were nice as well. The location is also great with 5 min walk to busy Shinbashi station which is convenient to go around in Tokyo for all directions. There are also plenty of restaurants around the hotel.Cons:There was really no bad points I found during my 5 nights stay but a few suggestions. Firstly I wish they had a free bottle of water in the room. Almost all hotels in mid range in this area has it and not having it a small disappointment. Secondly they is a very nice and spacious gym (one of the biggest free gym space in hotel in this area), but machines are limited with only 5 cardio machines and 1 chest press machine. It is really waste of space. I wish they had a cable machine, leg machine and free weights etc... it will differentiate this hotel from others because no hotel has a good free gym around here.

There were virtually no reviews to go by as it had only just opened while I was making reservations, but the location looked good and the online pictures also looked appealing. It belongs to a large conglomerate in Japan. So here are the pros and cons: Pros: it is nicely located near the Ginza district and a major subway station (an important factor for getting around Tokyo). The lobby is on the 18th floor and is large and pleasantly decorated in the minimalist Japanese style. The price was very reasonable for the area. Cons: We took a basic twin room, which was furnished very minimally and was not quite large enough for 2 people with luggage. There was minimal closet space and no drawers; there was also little space for luggage, so it was cramped and hard to stay organized. The staff’s English was very poor most of the time and they were not yet well trained at the concierge function. We took the breakfast package at the hotel, which....needs work. It was exactly the same every day, which got old quickly. There were both Japanese and American options, but more of the former, without enough choices for Western tastes. In addition they were stingy with certain items (fruit in particular, which kept running out) and couldn’t be bothered to properly peel items like pineapple or citrus, cutting them up but leaving the peel on. Initially they had a decent coffee machine with the usual options, but after that it was closed with a sign saying it was under maintenance. Thereafter only brewed coffee available. On our last day, they also ran out of both cream and milk, making no effort to get more, although there are several mini-marts close by. In summary, I would not stay here again because of the combination of small rooms and service deficits.

Very pleasantly surprised that staff now are able to communicate fairly well. Hotel and room look just like the website—clean, spacious enough for two although the standard king is tough to exit from one side of the bed since there’s only about 12” to wiggle through sideways....something to keep in mind. And they reserve body lotion for the premier rooms. Interesting. Otherwise we had no issues with space except the safe—VERY small. Big enough in width for iPad only. Height is standard.Located right across the street from a convenience store and within 10 min walk to major shopping in Ginza. You can see the Imperial Palace from the window. And the hotel is off the near side of Hibiya Park. Never took the metro but it’s also close by (walked past it). Tokyo Station is 20 min walk. They have a fitness room, laundry room and restaurant (no room service I think)—can’t comment on them personally.Honestly I’m glad I didn’t spend the 1200/night at the Four Seasons! This was a lovely hotel, boutique and modern. And in a safe quiet area in the business section. And Tokyo has Uber! They cancel a lot but when you manage to get one, the drivers speak English.","New York City, New York","pursuit</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",82,4.0
