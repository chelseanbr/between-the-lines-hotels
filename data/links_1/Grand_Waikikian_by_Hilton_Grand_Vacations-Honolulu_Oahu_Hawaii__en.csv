We went to our update as we haven’t been to one in a few years. Our salesperson didn’t update, but instead inundated us with rapid fire information covering every topic from her flying first class, driving a Mercedes, being a chef, living around the world. This included photo albums of her airline boarding tickets, her car keys to prove she drives a Mercedes and photos of her family, including her virgin daughter in law (yes, she told us this) When she did talk about the timeshare, it was hyperactive, high pressure and overwhelming, not to mention very confusing. She was degrading and insulting because we wouldn’t buy more points. I told her I was overwhelmed and her reply was that I hurt her feelings. She told me not to tell her boss in the follow up how I felt. I have a brain tumor, I do get overwhelmed easily. I left the room in tears. My husband was also overwhelmed. This is a horrible way to treat people who PAID A LOT OF MONEY already and a terrible waste of our time. After my husband and I had time to talk we decided this woman’s manager needed to know this information.We came back the next day to talk to her manager, whom we met the day before. He was sitting in the lobby, 10 feet away from us. We were told they’d call him. After a few minutes we were told he wasn’t in. I pointed out he was just sitting in the lobby and the guy at the front desk said “WE ALL LOOK ALIKE”. Are you kidding? We left, they knew we weren’t happy. As we walked out the manager came running after us....yes he was there (shocking). These people are LIARS. Just be honest and say he’s busy. Nothing I can’t stand more is liars (or people who make excuses for behavior).We are here now, we asked for an ocean view, but nothing is available, so we are a city view.

The penthouse experience should be top-notch and VIP from check-in to amenities all the way to check out. it felt very cheap and there was no distinguishing between penthouse and regular hotel room, other than size. Definitely NOT experience.5. Owners and those that rent The penthouse, especially owners who rent The penthouse, should not have to pay the $50 parking fee. If anything, it should be at a discount. We are already paying for VIP.... Why not extend that to the parking and have us pay less?6. 35th floor lounge breakfast: Mei Ling was the only person who treated us, and every other customer there, as special and VIP! She was the most gracious, friendly, warm person from the entire hotel!7. One night we had to pick up our car at 11:30 p.m. and it took us 30 minutes to find someone to find our car keys from the valet and get our car. we called the valet desk no less than eight times and no one answered! We finally had to have the front desk call. They said we might have caught the valets in a shift change. That should not matter, somebody should be manning that desk. This was definitely the worst, most insulting experience we've had as owners, and as penthouse renters. We rented the penthouse for two days for our CEO friend who is very VIP, and we stayed in at the third night. He was insulted and offended by the lack of service of Hilton and the Grand Waikikian, and he will never purchase nor stay at a Hilton property here in Hawaii again!

The Grand Waikikian is one of, I think, seven towers within the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I believe three of the seven are Hilton Grand Vacations properties and four are hotel towers.The GoodWe loved our room. We were on the 31st floor with a great balcony view of the entire village, the lagoon, the main pool and, of course, the ocean. We had a two bedroom with a full kitchen. The master was large with a nice bathroom which had separate shower and tub, and a Japanese-style electronic toilet (don't mock it until you have tried it!). The second bedroom had two double beds (not twins, which was nice) and a nice shower. Our unit also had it's own washer/dryer which was nice to do laundry there instead of when we got back home.My wife and I both have limited mobility and I will say that you will walk A LOT on this property. It was a good 10 minute walk for us to get down to the beach, and just getting around the property from tower to tower takes some doing. It would have been nice to have a golf cart to shuttle us around, but we were able to deal with it as is.The BadThis property is very crowded. If you are the type of person that thrives on the hustle/bustle of a city, with all kinds of activity going on all around you, then this might be the place for you. We have been to the other 3 main islands and the Village and Waikiki in general lacks that ""Aloha Spirit"" of the other islands. The staff was disinterested, at times, and the service in the restaurants was lukewarn for the most part.The UglyWhile we certainly understand that resort pricing is always at a premium, especially in Hawaii, $32 for fish & chips is flat out ridiculous. Thankfully, we did some grocery shopping and never ate breakfast at the restaurants and were able to save on lunches and dinners as well. There is also a food truck just off the property near the beach and lagoon that offered some nice options for far less money. The fish tacos there ended up being my son's favorite meal for the week. Also, did I mention that Hilton charges $45/night just to park there? Because of this, we used Uber/Lyft several times and they are always within a 3-5 minute pickup. We rented a car twice for the day to explore the east side of the island and the North Shore as well. I think we spent less that $270 on the week for transportation which was less than it would have been to park a car for the week, much less the actual rental cost. Also, the beach is fine, but if you want any shade, then you have the option of renting an umbrella and two chairs for $65/day. We just went to WalMart and bought two chairs and and umbrella for $30 and gifted it to another family on our last day.Final ThoughtsIf you like crowds, and cost isn't a focus for you, then the Village may be a good choice. We had a great time the week we were there, but our best times were when we got away from the Village and explored other parts of the island. We went to Pearl Harbor, found some great beaches that weren't overrun, and were able to get a little more of that Aloha Spirit on the North Shore. We didn't spend any time at the pools, mainly because they were very crowded and we weren't into getting down there really early to save chairs. There are 4 pools on the property - the main pool, a pool that's more for kids, and adult pool (small and subdued) and The pool at the Tapa Tower which we only saw a couple of times. We love Hawaii and can't wait to go back, but I think it will be either Kauai or Maui next time.","Laguna Niguel, California","grayhawk92677</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Laguna Niguel, California</strong>",7,3.0

I enjoyed my stay for the majority of the time however I enjoy the properties on the big island of hawaii rather than oahu for a few reasons. the specific hotel the Grand Waikikian was very complicated and hard to get to because we had to walk from the lagoon tower through multiple halls and rooms to even get to our hotel elevators. this typically would not bother me but after a long day at the beach i did not want to walk that far, let's be honest. the biggest issue i had with this exact resort was that the elevators were EXTREMELY slow there were 4 and i am not lying say we spent 5+ minutes waiting for ONE elevator. the final issue i had was on the big island at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, there are colored wrist bands that change everyday which helps to show who resort guests are. this is extremely helpful because it filters out random beach bums and non resort guests from using and occupying all of the facilities. besides these three things i liked this resort a lot. i personally liked the rainbow and tapa towers for their location but nothing beats and enormous rooms at the Grand Waikikian. there were many fun things to do such as yoga, lei making, and even fireworks on friday nights. i would definetly go back but it wouldn't be my first choice.

Absolute paradise! Our first trip to Oahu/ Waikiki and already want to go back!The Grand Waikikian was great! We were spoiled with the two bedroom, ocean view, suite. (Well worth the 90 minute sales pitch we had to go through.) Room had every necessity you'd need and was extremely comfortable. Also, never heard any noises from any of the adjoining rooms so the privacy was great too. The little general store in the lobby was great as it had everything (alcohol, snacks) and was open all day. The location is great too as there is plenty of stores/restaurants within walking distance. Hotel personnel were all very nice too.The pools, lagoon and beach were all very beautiful and made for long easy days of relaxing! You'll need to spend some money ($65) for a couple of lounge chairs and a pop up umbrella if you're going to be on the beach as the sun gets a bit scorching.We enjoyed walking to the downtown area, either via the beach walk or through the beautiful park, a few times and there are plenty of great places to eat and shop there. We rented a Jeep for two days and used it one day to travel to the north shore and the next day to the east shore. No real need to use it for anything else. We found a cheap tour that took us to Diamond Head and to Hanuma Bay which, while very busy, are musts to do. The Diamond Head hike is a workout!I definitely recommend this hotel, and any other hotel within this Hilton Village.

The Grand Waikikian tower is dated, dirty and the views are obstructed by buildings no matter what floor you are on or what view you’ve booked (we saw all types of views as we had to move rooms many times as a result of maintenance malfunctions, cleanliness etc. - food from a previous stay was even found in our freezer when we checked into a room that had been “cleaned”.) While the hotel claims renovations are planned in the next year, they don’t make you aware of this - you find out by reading reviews on the internet. The village the resort is situated in offers convenience to food, shopping etc. - all of which they advise you can charge to your room as they are part of “Hilton Hawaiian Village Waiiiki Beach Resort” - they don’t tell you that you will have issues charging to your room everywhere you go. Hilton will claim it is an individual vendor issue - the vendor will claim it is a Hilton issue. And if you call the front desk about it, they will be rude, dismissive and unwilling to help clamining these are independet vendors and not part of Hilton (yet, they are listed as part of Hilton village when they entice you to stay here.) Guess they want to make it as difficult as possible to spend those grand experience dollars they offer. This resort is terrible for kids. While I am sure many kids come back often, the kid pools are in the shade almost all day so the water is too cold to swim in, there is little to no seating around the pool, and no playground. Some may be used to limited amenities for kids - in our experience kid friendly hotels offer so much more. The beach the resort is on is not private so be prepared for panhandlers to solicit you while you are trying to relax and pickpockets scoping out your valuables while you swim in the water. If you are headed down as part of a marketing package, be prepared for everyone at the hotel to remind you that you do not own and are here on marketing dollars and they can’t help you. Then, after you are poorly treated, they will ask you to impulse purchase into their hotel timeshare program - why would anyone want to buy into a hotel where the accommodations are less than standard and the staff makes you feel like you don’t matter? All in all, this was a mediocre experience so while it may sound like an awesome deal, be prepared to be stressed while on vacation.",,01Travelbug27,2,1.0

This building (Grand Waikikian) is a bit of a walk to the pool/lagoon/beach but overall a very nice building. The HGVC pitch was the big downer. It took longer than promised, and we felt like we needed to take a shower after. It was a total used car salesman experience complete with being held in a small room and told we couldn't leave until the ""manager"" checked us out. The ""manager"" did another hard sell routine. Even after that we had to have another person come in and try more tactics. I'd rather pay full price than do that again.

The 2 BD suite was nice enough. Other reviewers say dated, and yeah a bit but mostly the issue is with overcrowding.

I was disappointed there’s no lifeguards... how is that even possible in a massive child’s pool with 3 water slides where the view is often obstructed? The Lagoon Bar served my drink with a paper straw. Don’t get me wrong, I’m in favour of reducing plastic consumption and I actually don’t mind paper straws. What I don’t understand is the entire week we stayed here, we separated our plastics/glass/paper from our garbage and were told that the resort doesn’t recycle. Imagine how much product that could be recycled but is instead going out as waste! It’s Hawaii! Isn’t this state all about protecting the oceans? What the heck?! ... so they don’t recycle any of the waste from any of the rooms but they will give you a paper straw?? This is backwards. This property needs to recycle. The cost for a chair $18 /day for the beach and a beach Umbrella $35/day; are you nuts? That’s insane. There were people smoking on the beach and the resort said they can’t do anything about it. Great! Second hand smoke for all your little kids playing on the beach. The beach was sandy only in parts; the parts that were overcrowded. The rest of the beach was rocky.

We had breakfast and lunch in the room each day by getting something either from in property (2 ABC stores to choose from) or one of the options across the road (Subway, sushi, Buffalo Wild Wings, McDonald’s, etc.). The balcony with a partial view of the ocean was nice because we had a great view of the city as well which was nice to relax on at night.The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to Ala Moana Shopping Mall which is convenient for some late night or early morning shopping. With kids it’s about a 20 minute walk each way to the main part of Waikiki which we did each night and was fine considering the big meals we had at Duke’s and the Cheesecake Factory.The apartment also has a TV in each room, full kitchen and washer dryer which is great for a family with kids. The pools were a highlight for my young sons with 3 water slides to choose from. The bigger water slides do require stronger swimmers or a flotation device.

It is part of the Hilton Hawaiian Village so there are lots of little shops, restaurants, beach activities, etc. We are Hilton Diamond members so we try to stay at Hilton products when available. This hotel is not directly on the beach, it is a short walk through the complex, so not too inconvenient. Positives:The set up of the unit is very nice for families. We travelled with our adult children and two grand babies who are 2 yrs and 6 mths old. The unit has 2 bedrooms, one BR with a bathroom that had a tub & shower. The second BR had 2 Double Beds & a bath with a shower. There is also a sofa bed in the Family Room. It was convenient to have a full kitchen, especially with young children in tow. There are service settings for 6 people (plates, bowls, silverware, etc) and a table & breakfast bar for dining. There are 3 TV's in the unit (1 in each BR + FR). There is a stacked washer/dryer in the unit which is nice so you don't have to take home dirty laundry. The staff at the hotel were very kind, they went out of their way to help you (with the exception of one of the pool towel guys who was very rude). We called many times for extra towels for the room (they would only supply 5 towels for some reason) plus we called for baby portable cribs, and they arrived within minutes of our request.The hotel lobby & exterior was decorated beautifully for Christmas and there were many nice areas for photos. The pool at this hotel is convenient for families, located just outside the lobby and it has several water slides for children and a slightly bigger slide that older kids/teens would like. There is a food stand by the pool so you can get treats, drinks, shaved ice, etc. There are several other pools at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, but we only went to the one at the Grand Waikikian. They have 3 DVD rental machines, kind of like Redbox, but you don't pay since it's part of the resort fee. That was nice to be able to relax and watch a movie in the evening. Within walking distance of the resort are many many shops and restaurants. We went to Hard Rock Cafe, Cheese Cake Factory & Outback which were all good. Within a few miles there are grocery stores, Walmart, Sams Club & Costco. The bellhops said that the Safeway store will deliver groceries to the hotel when you order online.Negatives:The unit itself was a bit run down. There were some kitchen cupboard doors that were coming off their hinges, the washer/dryer soap dispenser was falling apart, the extra blanket for the sofa bed had holes in it, the oven took FOREVER to heat up! There are no baking trays, we bought disposable aluminum trays to use. There is a safe in the room, but it was broken so we were nervous leaving computers, ipads, etc in the room. The toilet in one of the baths would run constantly & at times water would leak from the tank. There was a nice balcony, however the chairs were metal chairs with no cushions, so you had to put a towel, or one of the couch pillows on it, to be comfortable. We had booked an Ocean View Unit, and while you can see the ocean, it is not a direct view. There is another hotel in your view and the hotel is set back a ways from the ocean. The unit does not come with any condiments or spices for cooking, not even salt or pepper. Also there is not a blender in the unit (but we called down for one and they brought it promptly). The cleaning service was so-so. We only requested the unit to be cleaned every few days, but it seems like something was missed each time, like no spare trash bag, no dishwasher soap, not enough towels, etc. Parking is extremely expensive $47/day to park yourself, $50/day for valet. We did valet and the drivers were exceptional and courteous, it is just super expensive. Not only was parking expensive, but EVERYTHING at the resort is expensive. A teeny tiny pizza at Round Table (child size) was $10, a shaved ice at the pool was $10, the Luau pricing started at about $120/person. We went out to one of the restaurants the first night (Rocky's which used to be Benihanas), it was around $300 for 6 people & we did not even have any alcoholic drinks. The 2nd night we were at the resort, our little grandson ran into the table and cut his eye/face. We called down to front desk to find out where the closest urgent care was located so he could get stitches. They kept referring us to an in-house, on-call doctor. We kept asking for an urgent care, assuming the on-call Dr could not do stitches, or take the health insurance, but we were disconnected. It would have been nice if the front desk had emergency contacts for guests other than just telling us about an on-call doctor. While it is nice to have towels specifically for use at the pool, you need to be aware of the times that the towel stands are open (the towel stand at this hotel does not open till 9:30am) and DO NOT lose your pool towel card! This is not very convenient if you are heading out to another beach earlier in the morning. All in all it the hotel was nice, but I don't know that I would spend the money to stay here again (we paid $600/night for an ocean view room + resort fee & valet). I think I would look at other hotels or condos if we were to visit Oahu again in the future.",Arizona,"AZFam-Travel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arizona</strong>",41,3.0

Nice balcony with partial view of the sea. I felt really pressured during the time sharing meeting, the representative acted like my best friend until we started to ask question and ask for some time to think about it, the deal was now or never, like my money wouldn’t be good the next day.

We have used our points in several locations and countries. We always have been satisfied with our accommodations everywhere except in Waikiki. The Grand Waikikian did not meet the standard of other Hilton properties we have used for the following reasons. First the appliances in the kitchen were old and the dishwasher was not working properly. We did report it to the front desk. A repair man came by and left us a card that he had replaced the parts but the whole problem to begin with is that it had not been maintained properly and is due to be replaced. It did not work better after the service call barely washing our dishes sometime we would have to run the cycles 2 or 3 time to remove the soap scum. There was a huge build up of soap inside that was never dealt with and it was pretty disgusting. Clearly the soap dispenser was not working. No one from management followed up with us to see if the problem had been resolved. Who wants to spend their vacation time dealing with maintenance issues. The clothes dryer was old and took forever to dry so we used the balcony to dry our items. All the Hilton kitchens has the same basic things this one had less for some reason and the equipment was dated and missing things. The TV remote control in the master suite could only changed the TV channels backwards. There was only one sink in each bathroom. The closet wardrobe door in the master room did not open properly. Overall the rooms looked dated. The living room sofa was extremely uncomfortable to sit in and was in need of re-upholstery from holes on in the arms. Also the mattresses where not comfortable and did not meet our standard. I found a lot of dead space in the main lobby with a lot of walking to get to the units. The pools were also very disappointing. There is not a lot of space to accommodate the guests. I just came back and this is not the busy season yet I can only imagine how much less space there will be at peak season. There is no section for adults. The beach towels are the worst towels I have ever have to use in any resort. There are smaller than the ones in our bedroom covering very little of the pool chair if you happen to be lucky to get one. There are also very thin and rough. You can use the pool at the Hilton but it is a long walk and the layout is poor. There is a beautiful lagoon that could accommodate the extra flow of guests but you have to pay $ 18.00 to rent a chair and an $30.00 to rent a parasol. That is ridiculous. In view of the fact that the lagoon was empty HGV should consider having more chairs and parasol for free at the lagoon for their members for free and also to make sure gets a place to sit outside. By the way there is no parasol in any of the pool areas which again I have never again in any resort. So if you go to the pool be prepared to have no shade depending on where you are sitting. Also be prepared to pay $ 47.00 per day for valet parking or $ 43.00 to park your car rental per day. I find those rates again very stiff. I parked in downtown Vancouver hotel at a high end hotel the week prior and I paid $ 40.00. This is not the Ritz and I think they should make the parking rates more reasonable and give a special rates to the HGV owners.We did like the location and the Hilton HawaiianVillage with all the shopping and amenities. I think the The Grand Waikikian need a huge make over and a review of how their property is managed. I am no sure I could ever go there again unless they improve their accommodation.

First the good points. The room is beautiful with a stocked kitchen and comfortable beds and living space. From the balcony we had city views (even though I paid for a partial ocean view room) Some days we were just happy to stay in. The kitchen served us well since my fiance can prepare meals on the days we didnt feel like going out. Since our son has food allergies making eating out all the time difficult, having a kitchen was essential for us.....until the hot water stopped running. Front desk advised it was due to a leak and 'someone' was onsite fixing it and if we needed to take a shower we could go to level 8 to use the showers in the departure lounge. Only floors 28 and above were affected. No big deal as we were expecting the issue to be resolved soon. My fiance and son had to shower on level 8. My fiance said it was a like a hostel experience, sharing a communal wash facility. The next day still no hot water and asked for a manager with an explanation and requested another room. This time 'Joe' a manager advised they were waiting for a specialist to arrive onsite and that no rooms were available. He also said they were waiting for upper mangement to decide on a strategy based on how 'inconvenienced' guests were before deciding on compensation. As we had plans to go out for the day we hoped it would have been resolved by late afternoon after we came back which wasnt the case. This time we went down to the front desk and spoke to 2 resort managers. My fiance confronted the first manager demanding to find out what is actually being done to fix the hot water issue and if we could be moved to a similar room. Of course she didnt have a clue and went off somewhere to find an answer. Overhearing what was said the second resort manager advised a room was available. After telling him we were told a different answer he apologised and moved us to a similar room with hot running water. We were without hot water for 2 days and the way it was handled was just unacceptable. We basically had to confront the most senior resort manager to get something done or else nothing would have happened. For a name such as the Hilton to not have hot running water is inexcusable. Also they were still putting guests on the affected floors without telling them at check in which is a joke. In the end we managed to enjoy the rest of our stay but found out the hotel were waiting on a part to be shipped in from the mainland to fix the hot water issue. There was still no hot water after we checked out on the upper floors as far as we know.

Our one bedroom is a suite and at least twice bigger than our Lagoon Tower one. Even though it's city view on the 15th floor, it's fantastic because of the huge balcony that connects both living room and bedroom. We get to watch sunrise every morning and it was beautiful. Facing East along Ala Moana Blvd was nice as I observed the tower across that's facing West had the sun beating down on them daily and it looked too hot for me. Our suite enjoyed the city view and the park below comfortably.Inside there's a full size kitchen with everything -- utensils, detergent, paper towels, silverware, pots and pans, microwave, fridge, rice cooker, coffee machine, dish washer etc etc. You just need to supply own food (ABCs are just few minutes walk. Food Pantry market in less than 10 minutes walk). Living room has a pullout sofa bed even for 3rd, 4th guests. But for 2 the suite is perfect. Flat screen TV, PlayStation 3, dining table. Plenty of closet, drawers, hangars. In room safe.Washer and dryer is what we like BEST. For 2 weeks stay it's a godsend to be able to do laundry (they even provided detergent).Bedroom had ultra comfy bed. TV, hot tub for 2 all add to the fun. Through bedroom door or living room door one can access into the bathroom. Good size, shower only but strong and hot. The fancy toilet seat that's commonly found in Japan is here. You can adjust water spray, heat etc to pamper your bottom. Soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion provided.WiFi was free, strong and fast. Entire property is well kept and tastefully decorated. There's even a water filling station on level 2 where in house convenient store is. Staff very helpful and courteous.Access to all the pools, the Lagoon and the beaches are only minutes away. I didn't find this tower any less convenient than other towers which maybe few minutes faster by walking. The whole HHV complex is huge, take your time to explore.Being at the West end of Waikiki we can walk to center of Waikiki in about 15 minutes. And walking towards the Ala Moana Mall took about as long.Then there is THE BUS which we used and can get us farther to downtown, Chinatown. There are plenty of food choices both at HHV and outside and around the area. ALL within walking distance.This trip we ditched the rental car idea totally (parking at HHV $43 per night) as we already did circle the Island etc on last trip. Been there, done that. Surfing and snorkeling is not our cup of tea.Transport between airport and hotel we used Johnny's Cab, online booking is easy couple days ahead, $25 set rate. Uber and Lyft are also widely available for short and medium quick trips around town and does not cost much.","New Orleans, Louisiana","jenesairie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Orleans, Louisiana</strong>",313,5.0

However there is so much to see and do on the resort you will never be bored. Lots of shops, restaurants, spas, pools, the beautiful beach and lets not forget the amazing lagoon! Our hotel room was huge. We had a 3 bedroom penthouse. The balcony went around most of the room! We had a gorgeous corner suite. Full kitchen so we could cook (didn’t do a lot of cooking, but when we did it saved money). We stayed 10 days in this room. Had a huge living room. Ocean view. Very clean and spacious. Part of our family went home so we then moved to a 2 bedroom suite. Just as beautiful with a kitchenette. The resort is spectacular. Pricey so be sure to bring cash. It’s not an all inclusive resort so you do need some money on you. It’s like a mini city on the resort. It’s also within walking distance of the ABC stores and groceries. Nearby is a mall so we rented a car and toured the ENTIRE island. Just an incredible trip. Pools are very clean. Several of them around the resort. We found them to be a little chilly so our kids preferred the ocean and the lagoon. The sand is soft and white. The lagoon you can paddle boat and board in. My kids caught little fish with their hands then released them. We could snorkel there. The ocean is clear and calm. Could snorkel also. Ate at most of the restaurants on the property. Did a little shopping however it’s cheaper off the resort. Nice marina to check out also. The spa is wonderful! Overall it was an incredible vacation.

When the manager arrived I explained the situation and he stated that I am not allowed to curse at staff. First off I did not ever curse and I nicely asked to speak with a manager.

The hotel rooms are beautiful and spacious. The staff is friendly and have been very helpful when called upon. There are lots of things to do in the Hilton Hawaiian Village including swimming, shopping and places to eat. Honestly, I think this place has everything you need to have a great family vacation. Well, except for one thing… As a property owner, Hilton typically wants you to sit in on a 60-90-minute presentation to update owners on the newest happenings within the Hilton brand. Since Hilton is a very reputable organization with very good product offerings, I don't understand why they put their owners through high-pressure sales pitches using questionable sales tactics. Here are a couple of claims that were made to us during our presentation:First, my wife told the salesmen that the last presentation we sat through, she felt the salesmen was not straight with us. Our salesman told us not to worry because Hilton has eliminated 90% of the staff. (This may be true but seems a little fishy to me.)Next, we were asked to sign up for a new credit card that would give us more points per purchase than our existing Hilton American express. We would get up to 12 points per dollar spent. (This may be true as well but why is Hilton trying to get me to sign up for a new credit card. Seems strange.)Next, we were told about the new ""Maximize your point feature."" The salesmen stated that this new feature is only available to those owners who purchase an ""every year plan."" And this new feature would be available 15 minutes after we upgraded our plan. Our current plan provides points every other year which means we need to upgrade our plan to qualify. To prove his point, the salesmen showed me a property in Italy, that last year would require 200,000 Hilton Honor points to book. But as a yearly owner using the ""maximize your point,"" I could now book this property for 17,000 points per night. (WOW). I pulled up Italy on my phone and saw a property for 240,000 Hilton Honor points per day. The difference was the salesmen was showing me a cheaper property in Italy during a non-peak time, and the property I found was more expensive booked during peak time. In short, this had nothing to do with a “maximize your point feature,” but everything to do with peak seasons and hotel selection. Lastly, during the presentation, I noticed that I could not pull up my Hilton account on my phone while logged into Hilton's WiFi. I had to either switch on my VPN or log off the Hilton WiFI and use my cellular account. Of course, there is no way for me to verify this, but it appeared that they were blocking access to my Hilton account, so I could not validate their story. Just my guess. So what's my point? I love the Hilton product. Since being members, we have visited three Hilton properties, and they all have been great. The only downside to our vacations has been these high-pressure presentations. My suggestion to Hilton? Let your property, your name, and the excellent vacation experiences that you provide sell your products. Please stop the high-pressure sales and questionable sales tactics.","Lawrenceville, Georgia","OverFam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lawrenceville, Georgia</strong>",11,4.0

We booked a partial ocean view, one bedroom unit directly through Hilton, and got a real good price. We decided to add on to our Maui trip, and added 4 nights here on Oahu, before going back home to the mainland. We took a cab from the airport, no need for a car as everything we needed was in walking distance. Saved us a bundle of money, as parking was pretty expensive ($40) or so every night...The traffic is pretty congested, and I just didn't want to have to deal with it, turns out to be a good choice for the two of us. The cab rides were booked on line and only cost us $30 including tip each way. The driver was waiting for us at the airport, and twenty minutes later dropped us off at the Hilton.Check in was a breeze, we were given a room on the 27th floor, and as advertised had a partial (but pretty nice) ocean view from the balcony. I actually enjoyed the view of the mountains and nearby buildings and the Giilligans Island Boat Harbor as much as the ocean.. The view was amazing, I couldn't believe how lucky I was to have such a view as this.The one bedroom unit had a full kitchen, with all the necessary cooking tools. There was a full size refridgerator, with ice maker, a full size stove, oven and dishwasher. There were plenty of kitchen towels, and they give you two coffee packets for the Cuisenart Coffee Maker, which are replenished daily. The water tasted fine, but I prefer to use bottled water for the coffee and it did taste better with the bottled water. The ice cube maker in the fridge made plenty of ice, and it did not have any unpleasantness. Our ice tasted fine, not great, but fine. There is not very much storage for food items, so plan accordingly. Also, as there are no outdoor grill stations, you will have to broil those steaks in your kitchen oven.The living room was nice, and had been recently remodeled, I think, because the furniture was in surprisingly good condition. It was also very comfortable. The TV was on the smaller side, maybe a 43 inch screen? We didn't watch much TV, but there are three free Video Kiosks that allow you to borrow from, as often as you wish, and we watched a few movies.The bedroom and bathroom were clean, spacious and also in like new conditon. We enjoyed the view from our bedroom, as it looked out to Gilligan Island Harbor. The bathroom had a really unique toilet, I can't expain it, you have to see and experience it for yourself. It's something else.....The pool areas are, as you might expect, extremely crowded. The good news, you have Waikiki beach right there. We tried the pools a few times, but the noise and overcrowding made it unpleasant. I would probably consider the Alii building on our next visit, as they have a more controlled pool environment. The pool attendants did a good job trying to manage left towels on chairs, but the situation is pretty hopeless. The property is very underserved for pool access. For the size of this property, they need six or seven more pools, rediculous....We enjoyed the Village, the shops, restaurants, bars, and I think 3 ABC stores. We loved walking around the property through the small alley ways winding our way here, there, and everywhere. It was especially fun in the early evening, when it was all lit up, and not quite so hot outside, if had that Tokyo feel to it. We enjoyed it every evening.In summary, we had a very nice time at the Hilton Grand Waikikian. We loved having a one bedroom condo vs a hotel room, we loved the location, right on the beach, and we loved the friendly staff. We did not love the pool.....Not having a car, we walked up to Ala Moana Mall, to stock up on a few food items. It was only about 15 minutes or so each way. The Foodland Farms Grocery was fantastic. Prices were reasonable, and great selections. Friendly people. Well worth the trip.",Oregon,"SecondComing</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oregon</strong>",64,4.0

Milk was $10 a gallon just for example and other food items from offsite were pricey as well. The island as a whole is very beautiful. Took a Grayline Tour of Pearl Harbor and circled the island, a day long trip that was well worth it. We then rented a car for three days that included a parking spot within a 5 minute walk from the resort. Parking can run from $40 to $50 a day.

Could not fault the hotel from check in to check out. The room was better than I expected - 2 bedroom (king and 2 queens) with a sofa bed as well. Not sure if we just got lucky but had a partial ocean view and it was sensational. Room had everything we needed as a family of 6. Full kitchen with kettle and toaster. Even a dishwasher! Having a washer/dryer in the room was a bonus as well Housekeeping did a great job every day left more than enough in toiletries and towels. If I had one disappointment it would be the resort fee. If you can’t use the activities (because of disabilities) where you would get a discount it’s an exorbitant fee for two bottles of water a day. You don’t get a discount on parking or anything. Room are expensive enough to cover the cost of the upkeep of the resort and pools. I think they should reconsider this fee but having said that why would they when everyone just stays there and pays it. Everything else I could not fault you don’t have to leave the resort if you don’t want to but Ala Moana is a 20 min walk as is the Centre of Waikiki. Fireworks on Friday night were spectacular.

The fact that they aren’t getting a Terrible review shows how much this property has managed to impress us since we arrived.We were originally booked into the Grand Waikikian for 11 nights: two nights in a 1-bedroom apartment and nine nights in a 2-bedroom apartment. We booked through the Hilton website, the same way we would for any hotel booking and becoming Hilton Honors members in the process. What we didn’t appreciate at the time was the rigidity of their booking process and the extreme level of frustration we would experience when circumstances (a very sick baby) required us to delay our arrival in Hawaii by five days. I made 10 phone calls all up, no exaggeration. On the first call I was able to cancel the first two-night booking and was charged the expected one-night cancellation fee as it was inside their one-month cancellation window. The problem was the second booking. We didn’t want to cancel it, we just needed to change our arrival date from Wednesday to Saturday. Phone call after phone call and I kept getting referred to a different phone number because no-one could help me adjust the arrival date. On one occasion I was referred to their conferences and trade bookings phone number, on another occasion to a fax machine. I was referred to Hilton Grand Vacations as though I was a timeshare owner even though I had explained that I wasn’t, then back again to Hilton Honors because I wasn’t a timeshare owner. It was absolutely ridiculous and totally unacceptable. In the end I had to talk to the front desk at the Grand Waikikian and insist that they put a note on my booking stating that we would be arriving on Saturday and not to treat us like a no-show and cancel the room when we didn’t arrive as expected on the Wednesday. I had them send me evidence of the note too – my trust levels were so low. And obviously that meant paying for the full booking, not just the nights we could use, which would have been the case with a regular hotel. I know we’ll be back to Honolulu again however I will never book with a Hilton property again because they are incapable of dealing with a simple change request.So now to the Grand Waikikian…. Check in was very fast and friendly. The room was ready, as it ought to have been, and the portacot we’d requested was made up and outside the front door. (I hope it hadn’t been there for three days!) The layout of our 2-bed apartment was different to the floor plans we’d seen. We had an ocean view apartment (room 2902) and the view was all that we expected and more! Bedroom 2 and a self-contained bathroom (shower only) are on the right, followed by bedroom 1 which is massive with the open ensuite and small bathtub, then the corridor opens up into a lounge, dining and kitchen area. The lounge area seemed a bit squashed compared with some of the photos we’ve seen, but it had enough seating for four adults. The balcony off the lounge is a good size with four comfortable chairs and a round table so you could eat out there and savour the view. There is also a balcony off bedroom 2, with two chairs and a coffee table. From our bed in bedroom 1 we could see the marina and the ocean. It is lovely.We were happy with the amount of cookware and utensils in the kitchen. They also supply washing powder for the washing machine. They supply a caffeinated and decaf coffee sachet per day (four cups) but no tea. I brought my own, thank heavens. There is nowhere to hang wet clothes so I’d suggest bringing a portable clothesline if you prefer to air dry your clothes than use a dryer. Beds are comfortable, shower water pressure isn’t great, but I’ve come to expect that in big hotels.The Hilton complex is massive, and there are a range of pools to try out but you’ve got to get in early to get a deck chair. We went to the Paradise Pool three times without finding anywhere to put our towels. The lagoon is quite nice and one of the reasons we chose to stay here, though the sand is quite coarse by Australian standards. Who cares though, it looks beautiful!There are a range of bars and restaurants in the complex but we only tried two of them – Tropics Bar & Grill and a very casual pizza restaurant. There are no restaurants in the Grand Waikikian building itself. The closest eating options are in the Rainbow Bazaar and it gets very crowded. Room service is offered for breakfast and dinner but the menu is quite poor. There’s a Red Lobster and Outback Steakhouse 5 minutes’ walk from the Grand Waikikian for take-out which offer a great alternative if you don’t want to self-cater every night but are restricted from dining out by a small child.There is a small shop near the lifts on the reception level with basic cooking supplies, snacks, drinks, toiletries and souvenirs. Our main shopping was done at Food Pantry in Eaton Square. It’s less than 10 minutes away by foot. Alternatively there is an ABC Shop in the complex and also on the other side of Ala Moana Blvd. We were given vouchers for bottled water (2 small bottles per day) at check-in. You can drink the tap water but if you leave it to sit for any length of time it has a rather strange taste.We would have rated the Grand Waikikian Very Good (an Excellent apartment but losing points for the crowded nature of the pools, poor room service offering and not having a restaurant in the building) but given the hassle we experienced dealing with our enforced change I can’t give them more than an Average rating.",Sydney,"KJ74Sydney</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",24,3.0

Which means no matter how loyal you are to Hilton don't expect to get any perks even as a Diamond member when booking at an HGVC. I was told by the front desk that if you are looking for loyalty benefits book at the ""hotel"" part of the resort not HGVC. With regard to the accommodations, I must say this is definitely the furthest of all the towers from restaurants and the beach. At first I thought it was Kalia tower, but I was wrong. However, if you really want to do a lot of walking, you will definitely log some serious steps at the Waikikian. But the elevators are definitely more readily available than Lagoon tower. Our 1-Bedroom Partial Ocean View room had a nice kitchen, breakfast nook, living room w/ sofa bed and a good sized bedroom that had a 2-person tub (yes in the bedroom) as you see in the pics and a roomy bathroom w/ shower and single sink. The bathroom also had a connecting door to the living room which I thought was convenient so you didn't have to enter the bedroom to get to the bathroom. If you are looking for ocean view, definitely book ocean view. What they consider partial ocean view is a joke. You have to go to your balcony, lean over the rail and then look beyond to see that partial ocean view. Housekeeping as usual is fantastic! The staff is very friendly and always welcoming. I still say after staying at Waikikian, Kalia, Lagoon and Ali...STAY @ ALI!

I am ashamed to say this but this property over the last 10 years has become like a old amusement park, dirty, dated, and poorly kept and worn out!! Too many people and over sold it now has taken it's toll!! First off most of the classy stores have left , that's putting it mildly the penguins are no longer there to greet the guest,Tropic's the Restaurant with beach side seating has been covered with a net giving you a feeling of being a trapped in like a wild animal when dinning , making the view obscured by the netting! The abeyance is gone no more sitting and enjoying the beautiful view of people and ocean. The open air experience is gone and somehow the birds still have figured out how to get in to restaurant and eat scrapes of food so now your chance's of being pooped on are even better because they are trapped under the netting!! It now lacks that relaxed and wonderful view of the sunsets on the beach. The timeshare rooms are worn and dated including the mattress""s on the beds after one night of sleeping on a worn out bed and sinking to a nest like form with pillows that smell like someone's bad breath and have no neck support you are ready to go home! The DVD players are so dated that when you turn them on it's so loud it sounds like a airplane engine tunneling wind and you can't hear the movie it will also get on your nerves after a day or two!! Lighting in this condo is minimal so don't expect make up mirrors with lights because there are none, and the size of your TV in the master bed room is the size of my carry on laptop screen!! It's a complete joke for this day in age! I mean Best Buy sells new TV's cheap Hilton! The hallways of the Waikikian upstairs as you can imagine of course smell of remnitz's of a leftover of nationality of foods that have been prepared by the occupants, at times we saw trash bags in hallways with leftover garage from thoughts foods which just enhanced the smell in the air in the corridors. This is not what we were expecting! We are totally disappointed that the Hilton Reputation has gone down hill!! I am sorry to say that you are no longer the clean,classy , timeshare you sold us on!!

The $43 parking fees per night are just highway robbery and should be included with the very expensive room price. Don't plan on using the pools unless you get there before 10:00 as the pools are not near large enough to handle the probably 7,000 guest that are staying at the village at any one time.Probably the biggest complaint is the fact that we are just your average Americans and not Japanese, our hotel was at least 90% Japanese and they are treated like royalty. We were trying to get information from a concierge on some whale watching but every concierge had a Japanese they were helping for hours at a time bc we passed by constantly. Finally we did find one open and asked about the whale watching tour they would recommend and they just took the brochure I had already picked up and started reading, they must have thought I couldn't read, I told him I had already read the brochure but wanted someone's opinion that actually lived here bc there were many whale watching tours but he just said I guess they are all the same. It was at this point that I knew we were definitely second class at this hotel bc I think I knew more than he did and I had only been on the island a few hours. Unfortunately it seems like the whole island of Oahu is like this, if you are planning to do anything you have to get there before the bus loads of Japanese get there bc they get first preference even at the restaurants in Honolulu. All in all once I learned how things worked I was able to adjust and still see most of what I wanted to see and do without hurting someone in Oahu, Japan!!!","Gulfport, Mississippi","bep2795</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gulfport, Mississippi</strong>",1,2.0

The hotel is well maintained with friendly and helpful staff. We arrived early at about 11am for check-in (normal check in is at 4pm) and was unfortunately unable to get into the room right away. We still completed registration and got all the room keys and cards for the towel service and free DVD rental, then registered my phone to accept a text from the concierge when the room was ready — however they could not tell me what room we would get. I was offered a lounge that we could use that has comfortable seating and showers until the room was ready (which is also available if you have to check out early but you have a late flight) but opted to grab lunch off property. By the time we finished our lunch, I received a text that the room was ready — a very welcomed surprise! We did not have to return to the front desk as they programmed out pre-registered keys and we just went directly to the room. Very expedient and a service that was completely no hassle. As for the hotel itself, we feel that even as it is at the west end of the Waikiki area, it’s a great balance of good walking access to the middle of Waikiki and the main mall (Ala Moana Shopping Center), away from the crowds of Waikiki beach, as well as easy access when driving to other places on the island without dealing with the traffic of Waikiki. Having a Resort that is actually beachfront in Waikiki is a treat, and because it is not on Waikiki Beach means that it’s not crowded or noisy ever. It is well positioned on the Hilton Resort property, with direct elevator access to the parking garage but steps away to the beach, pools, and shops/eateries within the resort. Many of the other hotel towers on property do not have direct access to the parking garage (a godsend for shoppers). The rooms are well maintained, with separate living/dining room area and kitchen, a large tub in the bedroom and walk-in shower in the bathroom. A fun surprise is the electronic toilet seat that was not there last year. The resort fee (charged per day per room) and the parking fee continues to increase but I guess that’s the price you pay for paradise.We have stayed at other hotels in Waikiki and while they had better access to Waikiki establishments, they were noisy as many hotels feel like they are right on top of eachother and they were not beachfront, meaning we had to carry our stuff across the busy Kalakaua Ave to get to a crowded beach with all of the other hotel guests staying in Waikiki. We’ve also stayed at several towers in Hilton Hawaiian Village as well as, but find the Grand Waikikian to serve as a perfect balance for all our needs while on Oahu. We will continue to call this hotel home while in Hawaii.","Portland, Oregon","BeATraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",57,5.0

We arrived at the location around 12. We asked a couple people were we needed to check in, and we waited in a line there only to find out we were at the wrong hotel! Even though my reservation said Grand Waikikian (and no other info), our stay was really at the Lagoon Tower. So we had to haul our two kids across the campus and attempt to check in again. When we did, our room wasn't ready. That's ok as they would hold our luggage. I asked where the elevators were, and I was told the wrong ones. Of course, I didn't realize that until I was walking around the 7th floor looking for the wrong number of room. Again, I've got 2 kids with me while my husband is trying to park the car. I had to walk back downstairs (quite a journey) and call my husband. PARKING was a HUGE pain. The cost is insane - think NYC prices, $50 for valet. $43 for self parking. for Self parking you will have a few blocks walk, and it is just not worth MORE walking. Even valet parking was an enormous headache bc it was so crowded and the drop-off was so tiny. There were constant taxis in and out, buses, golf carts, minivans, etc. It was scary with kids and difficult to get a minute to buckle them in their car seat. It was one of the worst parts of our stay, every single day. The complex is too overbuilt and there is not enough pedestrian space. My next biggest problem was that they gave us a handicapped accessible room. We waited for about 4.5hrs for our room (check in is at 4:30 I think?) They told us when it was ready we would get a text. Great. We went straight to our room. We looked around and I was underwhelmed. Then later my daughter came to me and said, ""where's the bathtub?"" Sure enough, I realized we had no bathtub. I called immediately and said, ""I'm sorry, but we weren't told this was an accessible room."" She said, ""You weren't?"" No....we had just gotten a text and came up. She said that since we had already put our stuff down etc etc, the room was going to have to be cleaned (NOT MY PROBLEM). I explained to her that I have two small kids and I need a bathtub. She put me on hold, and came back and said the best they could do is for ME to check out, bring my bags downstairs at 10am the next day. Then they'll see what they have and we can recheck in at 4pm. I said that was unacceptable. She said, sorry that's all they can do. I find that really unhelpful. We paid a lot of money to stay there and we are Hilton Gold members. The very *least* they could have done was offer to help us down and back up with our luggage, instead of telling *me* I had to do it. Obviously, they didn't want to give me another room. I said again, ""I don't know how I'm going to keep a crawling baby out of a shower with no door. And I don't know how I'm going to bathe a baby after the beach without a bath."" She said, ""I'm so sorry ma'am."" end of conversation. It was seriously annoying. Considering I paid good money to stay there, I should have been asked about the room. And when I complained, I should have been reassigned. It was not my fault, and they acted like it was my fault.The room itself was very dark and loud. We have previously stayed at other HGV locations and to us, this room was dated and overpriced. We were disappointed. Granted we were on the 7th floor, it was so loud outside it was impossible to enjoy being outside on the balcony, let alone listening to the tv. The kitchen was awkwardly designed with the microwave hardly in reach of everything else. The shower and bathroom were really basic. The showerhead was pathetic (handicapped accessible). The only thing remarkable was the bidet seat.Also, I wouldn't recommend this hotel b/c it is too massive. My husband put it, ""Water water everywhere and not a drop to drink."" In all things. People walking around everywhere, no one helpful. 6-8 pools, but get ready to walk 15mins to get to one. They nickel and dime you with everything, including towels. I asked a couple times where we could get breakfast, and I could never understand how to get there...to any of the restaurants...and in alllllllllll our walking...I never saw a hotel restaurant. I saw other restaurants around the public beach area, but not a hotel restaurant. ? Additionally, we constantly had a language barrier. I have traveled a lot and this was part of an 11 day stay in Hawaii. This hotel was the only one that we repeatedly could not understand what the workers were saying. They were nice, but unhelpful b/c I couldn't understand them. It was a really frustrating experience. Our guest room attendant was nice, but again, a language barrier.Lastly, I didn't like how the beach and pool area was open to the public. The ""super pool"" with the slide was where my daughter wanted to swim. People were constantly walking around, hoards of people. It was just chaotic.  Ultimately, Kingsland was so much better and I wish I had of just stayed there the entire 8 days instead of breaking up my stay.",Nashville,"MMD13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville</strong>",7,2.0

The lady at reception was lovely and offered to check us into our room early so we could put our baby down to sleep. As we were finalising the room details, my husband noted that we had booked and paid for a full ocean view room. We had come to Hawaii to celebrate my birthday so we had splurged on our room choice and paid more for a full ocean view rather than partial at the hotel. We were then told we had a partial ocean view room as that was the information Agoda (who we booked through) had given them. We produced our booking confirmation (which clearly stated ocean view room) to which we were told “it’s not there problem” and we need to sort it out with Agoda! After going back and forth for 20 mins, with our baby getting upset, we decided to just accept what we had been given for now and they would get back to us with a resolution. So..I am currently sitting in my partial ocean front room. It is a view of a busy road and high rise buildings. If you stand on the edge of our balcony and look around the corner you can just, and I mean just, see the water!!!Neither Agoda or Grand Waikikian are taking responsibility for falsely advertising Ocean Views, charging for Ocean Views, but providing a room that doesn’t even come close.

It's not a bad place to stay, by any means. The condo has small, but full-sized kitchen and a washer and dryer. The beds are comfortable. Plus, it's very clean and our housekeeper was honest. One of us left a credit card out on the kitchen table, and there were no unidentified charges on it. All staff members have been helpful, although a couple were a little too pushy trying to lure us to a timeshare presentation. We even had a great view of the luau and their awesome hula and fire dancers.Also, the grounds are nice with a good selection of restaurants (if you're not vegan), stores, and swimming pools. I'm partial to the Le Sportsac store, and the Paradise pool with its 3 sliding boards is great for kids. They even have attendants at the slides to make sure just one person goes down at a time.So what's not to like?My number one grievance about this place is that it's noisy, both inside and outside the condo. The walls seem to be paper thin, and a person with normal hearing can hear people on the other side of the common wall. Even worse, there's a LOT of noise outside, such as music from bars. We're on the 28th floor, and it's just about impossible to fall asleep before 11 pm due to the music outside. We like to go to bed early so we can be up early for activities, such as snorkeling and climbing Diamond Head. We don't like to be kept up by all the ""night life"" noise outside.Furthermore, there are a few odd things about the condo:* The bathroom to the master bedroom doesn't have a door, other than a separate toilet room. So there's no privacy between the tub and shower and the bedroom. The sink is close to the bed, which can easily wake up a light sleeper.* The master bedroom/bathroom have a window that views the ocean, but there's no blackout shade on it like the window parallel to the bed. Why would there not be a blackout shade or curtain on EVERY window?* There are no pullout clothes lines in either of the bathrooms. Many lower end hotels have this small but very useful amenity.* There's a problem with the air-conditioning, as it keeps getting too cold no matter where you set it. To fair, the Grand Waikikian offered to immediately have someone come and fix this. We just haven't been in the room during working hours to have someone come up. (I did not factor this into my rating.)* One of the elevators scared me, as you can hear the cables banging, and you're not supposed to hear that. The other three elevators are fine. All the elevators are fast.If noise doesn't bother you, or if you're a ""night life"" kind of a person, I bump my rating up to 4 stars and recommend the Grand Waikikian for you. Or if they fix the elevator, put in a bathroom door or at least divider, plus a blackout shade in master bedroom and pull out clothes lines, I'd also bump my rating to 4 stars.

It is one of the oldest and most well-known resorts in the area. The resort is also centrally located and is walking distance to many shops, restaurants, and other activities. The Resort is made up of a couple of different hotels including the Hilton Hawaiian, the Grand Waikikian, and others. The Grand Waikikian is part of Hilton Grand Vacations so they are mostly suites – and that is what we were looking for. Each suite came with a room with 2 double beds, one bathroom, a full kitchen, washer/dryer, and a dining table. As they are part of the resort, each room comes with a resort fee which includes Fitness/yoga classes, Internet access, in-room bottled water, and other resources for $35/day. Booking the hotel was easy and convenient through Hilton’s website.There are many entrances to the resort depending on which hotel you are staying at – each hotel has their own separate entrance. The entrance to the Grand Waikikian was off to the side and it was at the far side of the resort, so you have both marina and beach views but you are not on the beach. The hotel lobby is located on the main level and it is an open air lobby to allow for the breeze from the ocean. The lobby contained the check-in desks, the valet, the concierge, and a couple of benches. It is not a traditional lobby but it serves its purposes. Check-in was easy and we received our keys, a map to the resort, as well as a packet which included amenities included in the resort fee. This included towel passes for the beach, passes for two free bottles of a water a day, a dvd rental, as well as shopping discounts. The elevators to access the rooms were not located near the lobby – to access them you had to walk out of the lobby, through the concierge room to another hallway and walk down that hallway to get to the elevators. It was a bit confusing at first and not well planned out. There are 4 elevators and each time we did not have to wait a long time for the elevators. The elevators came and we went to our room on the 17th floor. When you enter the room, you enter into the open kitchen on right hand side and a door to the left which leads to the bathroom. The open kitchen is spacious and includes a full fridge, a stove, a microwave, an oven, plates, glasses, cutlery, a toaster, a coffee maker, and a full sink. It was a nice full kitchen. On the other side of the counter to the kitchen were chairs were you could sit and eat. There was also a half table that pulled onto a bench so that was another option to eat there. Beyond the kitchen was the sitting area with a couch and chair against one wall and the TV on top of a chest against the other wall. The chest had the TV on top and a drawers on the bottom. The sitting area looked out onto the balcony which was a bit small but was nice to go outside and see the sights and enjoy the breeze. Next to the TV was a door that led into the bedroom. Given how spacious the other rooms were, the bedroom was a bit narrow. The bedroom contained two double beds with a nightstand in the middle against one wall, and another chest with a TV on top and the drawers on the bottom. The beds were comfortable and provided a good night’s sleep, there just was not a lot of room between the two beds. Next to the beds, with minimal separation between the two, was an area that contained a tub on one wall and the closet on the other. It was an odd layout to have a tub in the middle of the room. The closet contained a safe, an iron, ironing board, and luggage rack; however, considering the narrowness of the room it was not a lot of space to place your luggage. In between the tub and the closet was a door that led to the bathroom. The bathroom contained a sink a standup shower, and a Japanese-style toilet. The Japanese-style toilet was a nice and welcome touch. The bathroom itself was a decent size. The bathroom also contained a second door which led out to the main room next to the kitchen and the main door. As you existed the bathroom, and before you got to the main door, on left hand side was a closet which contained the washer and dryer. Overall, the room had many amenities that were very nice and the sitting area was spacious; the only negative was the lack of space in the bedroom area.There are many amenities that can be accessed as part of the resort. As the hotel is part of the Hilton Hawaiian Village, you can walk around and access any part of the resort. Each hotel had their own pool, so you could choose which pool you wanted to access. To access the beach you had to walk to the Rainbow Tower near the main entrance to the resort as that was the only beach access. Other amenities included free classes in the morning, fireworks on Friday night, many restaurants to choose from, an entire whole shopping village which included other restaurants, desserts, souvenirs, a convenience store, and other amenities. If you wanted, you could access everything in the resort and never have to leave. The hotel did provide free wifi, but our wifi was only applicable in our tower. Other amenities we took advantage of was the discounted taxi rate and the lounge. The resort does not provide transportation to and from the airport, rather they have negotiated a special discounted rate with a local taxi company that provides a flat fee to passengers to and from the airport and the hotel. We used this service on both sectors and it was very convenient and easy to use. Another amenity we utilized was the lounge. Check-out of the hotel is very early, at 11am, and given the high volume they generally do not allow for late check-out. To compensate for those guests who have later flights, guests can access the lounge throughout their stay and after checkout. The lounge is like a standard business lounge with lots of couches and tables for people to relax and rest. There are many outlets so you can charge your electronics as well. No food is provided and only water, tea, and some juices are provided. There is a small kids play area as well as a small business center as well. There are bathrooms as well as showers available, as well as hotel amenities included soap, shampoo, and lotion. The hotel will hold your luggage so this lounge is a nice place to go and relax and recover prior to your late night flight. Overall, it was a pleasant stay at the Grand Waikikian. The hotel provided a lot of amenities for their guests. The rooms themselves were nice and had lots of amenities, with the only downside being the lack of space in the bedroom. While the costs for the Hawaiian Village are a bit higher, you do get a lot of amenities as well as a convenient access to many shops and restaurants within walking distance to the resort.","Kenner, Louisiana","0504Traveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kenner, Louisiana</strong>",219,4.0

I figured with that and the fact that we're Hilton Vacation Club members, we'd have an awesome experience at this hotel. Was I ever wrong about that! When we checked in, after a long airplane ride from Denver, Colorado, we learned they had put us in a handicap room. Neither myself or my husband are handicapped, and there was no explanation for this. We also expected to have a view of something other than the buildings of downtown Honolulu. But that was what we got. When we tried to change rooms upon checking in, we were told that was all that was available unless we'd like to move to a floor nearer street level where traffic was very noisy. Hilton has a policy that when you have a problem upon check-in, a supervisor is to be summoned, yet we were never in contact with anyone other than the person at the check-in desk who had no good news for us. She went to a back office at one point, I assume to make further inquiry, but we never spoke to any supervisor. We borrowed points from 2018 in order to stay at this hotel which incurs an additional cost to us to transfer points. What a disappointment we had. Our room was not made up each day and the room, which was set up for a handicapped person, was extremely inconvenient for us in that closet and dresser storage was not even in the sleeping area, but around the corner in the bathroom. We'll not be going here again any time soon. Pool area was large, but overcrowded so we never even went there.

Check in was rather confusing cause the hotel Check-in is different than the condos. Didn’t realize that until waiting in line at the hotel side. Got checked in and went to the room. It was very nice. Large kitchen and living room with sleeper sofa. Large bathroom and bedroom. Plenty of room for the three of us. Oh and the best part is the balcony. Are breakfast there every morning. I mean you’re in paradise how could you not wanna enjoy it. We had a city view which was fine wasn’t expecting much but our view was not just city but we had water views as well. Score. It was magical. The pools were great our room over looked I believe the paradise pool. Which was full mostly by 10am with kids playing since I believe that’s the only pool with the slides. The towel boys where great at the lagoon and beach. It’s kinda awesome walking from your building right onto the beach. That’s what I wanted as close to the beach as possible. We did rent some umbrellas for the beach days which was a wise idea as it would sprinkle a few times and people would leave but not even ten mins later the sun was out again. The water was a bit chilly in the ocean but it was nov and I was in the ocean in Hawaii there’s no reason to complain about that. There was one problem though. The elevators. They are always packed. It sometimes took 20 mins to get one that wasn’t full. I’d say we waited sometimes for 4 -6 elevator passings for it to have room for us to get in. My suggestion is when you’re at your floor trying to go down hit the up and down button. When ever it comes and has room in it get on. Otherwise you’re gonna be waiting a long time. It’s faster to ride up a few floors then back down then wait for the down. They really need to find another way for employees to change floors with the carts. The cleaning crew did take up a lot of space. They should have a cart per floor that way no transferring carts around. Oh well if that’s the worst thing then it wasn’t too bad. Have to say it was a wonderful week. And they actually waited till after thanksgiving to put up Christmas decorations which were Beautiful. I’m sure I’ll be back to the property. ,"Washington, Missouri","soundman12000</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, Missouri</strong>",7,5.0

The hotel should look at implementing a self check in system when it takes that long to get guests to their rooms. Secondly, the parking, charging $40+ for parking each day is highway robbery, this parking should be half that, $15-$20. The parking attendants and valets are also very jumpy and all over you for a tip which we felt very uncomfortable with. The staff were attentive at times but also are VERY biased towards the Japanese guests, many time we would walk past a desk and not get greeted but the Japanese behind us would get a warm greeting, this is unacceptable and very off-putting, a guest is a guest and all should be treated equally.

The pools are beautiful and the lagoon as well but, again with the fees! charging a crazy amount for the pool toys and water bikes is ridiculous, guests are shelling out a fortune to stay there and this should absolutely be included!

The hotel has very nice rooms that were clean and modern and we had a spectacular view. The only negative was check-in. We made our reservation back in February and specified a two bedroom suite with One King bed and another with two queen beds. At check-in they only had suites with two king beds. This was not ideal for a family with two teenage boys.I was told at check-in that Room Type is not guaranteed when the reservation was made. (News to me). So why specify the room type? This is something everyone should be aware of when you book a room at a vacation (time share) property and you are not an owner...In the end the hotel did make it right and they magically came up with a room which made the stay very enjoyable.The pools are nice but very crowded and the accompanying village and shopping is nice to walk around in.

To get the noms we wanted my wife had to go online and book the 2 BR and 1 BR rooms we wanted back in November. The rooms go quick. The resort complex is vast and crowded. When we arrived we were facing the parking lot, but the worst was the layers of pigeon droppings ALL around our balcony. It was horrible to sit outside, my wife likes to sit outside and drink her morning coffee. I enjoy evenings on a balcony. It was impossible to sit outside because of the stink and sight of pigeon poop all over the place. It wasn't just by our balcony but everywhere on that side of the building. I immediately went downstairs to a resort manager and explained the issue. She changed our room to the other side. No pigeon poop at all. Now HGVA tells you that the cleaning service only comes 3 times a week. If you want more than that then it will cost you. We are OK with that but in a 2 BR with 5 people you generate garbage. We had bags of garbage. There should be somewhere to bring the garbage. We rented a car, they charge you $39 a day to self park. WTF!!!! I give HGVA thousands of dollars to be an owner. Charge me to park!! Really???Now it wasn't all bad. The accommodations and great. Hilton quality. If we needed something, ice, toilet paper, etc we called 54 on the phone and it was brought up quickly. The beds were comfortable, showers spacious.The bellmen were attentive to our needs.I probably wouldn't go back, but thats not because of anything they did wrong. I enjoy quiet laid back resorts.

This was our 3rd visit and we always have a great stay. We like the location at the end of Waikiki. It is close enough to walk to the main shopping and restaurants on Waikiki, but less crowded on the beach. The Hilton Hawaiian Village has most of what you would need, but we always walk to the shopping area a few times and walk along the beach to have lunch or dinner at other hotels. One of the great things for us about the Waikikian is the kitchen. We make a trip to the Walmart and/or the ABC store to get supplies for breakfast and lunch so we don't have the expense of eating out all the time. We also like the lagoon at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It is annoying to pay $15 to rent a lounge chair, but it is nice to be at the beach of Waikiki or at the lagoon and not be right up alongside a bunch of other people. The lagoon is nice for stand up paddle and for the kids to swim and snorkel without the waves. There are some fish to look at in the lagoon although not as colorful and impressive as you find on the snorkel trips.

In Hawaiian village3. awesome pools. 1 pool has 2-3 slides. great fun.4. lagoon is walking distance, kayak rentals. do the aloha combo, best value for your money.5. beach is on the property.6. ABC stores all around to shop for grocery items. We had a kitchen in our room so we shopped for breakfast items and saved money on breakfast.7. Free dvd rentals8. Parking is very close. dont use valet. In fact rent a car the days you need it.9. Wifi is great.10. Rooms are great. Well atleast the 1 bedroom suite was. No complaints.negative points:1. you get 2 bottles of water for free everyday. That should be in the plus point but if you have to collect that water from concierge. thats a very big negative. Since they leave at a certain time. and also that is not their main job. You have to stand in a queue of people actually using concierge service and then get your 2 bottles. I also noticed some of the concierge seemed mad to bring the bottles of water. I was late to collect the bottles on night and I missed the concierge closing time by 5 mins and the check-in people couldnt get the bottles. that is just ridiculous.2. Parking fee is exorbitant $40 to self park $48 for valet.3.

Go toward the beach to get to Lagoon tower and then reverse to go back to GW rooms. Annoying. Also, cannot enter GW from the street. Try other towers instead.

Over the years we've often chosen to stay ""in town"" and we familiar with about a dozen properties in Waikiki. We regard the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort as our mainstay because the amenities and services are plentiful. It is an exceptionally good choice for families. This review is specific to the HGVC Grand Waikikian Tower. This tower occupies real estate that was once the home of ""The Waikikian"" hotel, a motor inn style hotel that dated back to the beginning of the jet age (hence the name). It is set back a bit from the ocean, relative to some of the other towers and close to Ala Moana Blvd. Our room overlooked Ala Moana Blvd (even # rooms...odd # rooms over look the 'resort' which, immediately, is the parking deck). and provide a mostly ""city view"", even though it is was marketed as ""partial ocean view"" (I would say VERY partial, see photo). If you want to see more ocean, you may wish to consider the large suites that are ocean-front on this tower, or, better still, the Lagoon Tower (or Rainbow Tower). The one bedroom suite was pure perfection and wanted for nothing that I could imagine. Once thing I noticed was how remarkably quiet the room was, even though it was directly on a very busy road in Waikiki. When the sliding door to the balcony was shut, you could hear nothing from the outside (when its open. that is another matter). Another excellent feature that this tower has going for it above ALL of the other towers in the resort is that it has direct access to the vast parking deck. All of the other towers have at least a short walk to the deck (through a retail area) This tower a single floor elevator ride and you are in the deck. The parking on the Waikikian side is in less demand, so were able to find parking within 10-15 spots of the door to the elevator. Super convenient! The Waikikian also has two other features that are very handy: a convenience store in the lobby just steps from the elevator to the rooms and a courtesy lounge on the 8th floor with lockers and showers, etc. in case you arrive early or have a late flight. While we didn't use this lounge, it is a thoughtful accommodation to guests. The public areas of this tower have plenty of seating, but it has an almost mausoleum-like quality and is obviously only a pass-through to more busting areas of the resort. The tower is adjacent to the Paradise pool which is the pool that has water slides and a hot tub area. It is also close to the lagoon. We needed to make a single call to guest services for bedding for the roll-away sofabed. It was delivered promptly. The resort fee was $30/night and the parking was $39/night. These compare favorably to hotels in other metropolitan areas.",Honolulu,"hirunningman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu</strong>",79,5.0

It has been disappointing and frustrating since we stepped foot out of the Taxi.Firstly, flights arriving from Australia land between 5:00 and 7:00am. The hotel made us wait 7.5 hours to check into our room because check-in time is not until 16:00. When you come in from a long haul flight all you want to do is shower and settle in. For us the time was spent sitting in the lobby twiddling our thumbs. And then sitting in the lounge with all of the other depressed people who have to wait or have been kicked out at 10:00am waiting for afternoon flights.I booked this place through a travel agent and the itinerary didn't say anything about having to pay a $35.00 USD resort charge PER DAY. This covers Wifi, local calls, two bottles of water a day and 10% off activities booked at the hotel. I don't need or want any of this but still, $35.00 a day is automatically charged. Guest Services rang me shortly after check-in to ask how I was. I told them the check-in experience was pretty frustrating. ""Sorry about that have a nice day"". Thanks i'll do my best!I'm a Hilton Honours member and pretty much exclusively stay at Hilton properties all over the world. I have always seen cards in the rooms saying if you are unhappy about anything please talk to us and we will try and make it right. I thought I would do just that and see reception. I told them about the check-in experience, the extra fees etc. I thought it would be the perfect opportunity if they could make it right by allowing me a late checkout. I got told the checkout time is 10:30am so I'm welcome to stay until 11:00am free of charge. Thanks so much for the half an hour! My flight departs at 22:00 so something around the 15:00 mark would have been a nice gesture without causing you too much grief. It really is a shame because the Hotel is beautiful, the rooms are extremely well equipped and the location is prime. The bad experiences have made certain that I will never book a Hilton property in Hawaii ever again. So my advice to anyone reading this. This hotel is expensive, it has hidden costs, every question you ask the answer is going to be a polite 'no' and the check-in/check-out time is extremely poor. If I were you, do some very good research as there are much better hotels around the area in the same price range.","Kyoto, Japan","L0CK1E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kyoto, Japan</strong>",40,2.0

We found no fault with the rooms or equipment and it was quiet and relaxing for most of the time.

The room itself was decent. The bedroom was very nice, and the bed super comfortable. The pullout was suitable for kids (we have a 14 and a 10 yr old), though not particularly comfortable if you're an adult. Kitchen is well stocked with utensils, pots, pans and detergent, although there's no provided salt, pepper or oil, so you'll need to buy all of that. The swimming pool at the Grand Waikikian is relatively small, and was very crowded every day we were there. The lagoon was OK, but I felt the one at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island was better. Restaurant food was good, but quite pricey; we paid more than $200 for a light 4 person lunch at the Tropics restaurant. The hotel itself is quite close to lots of stores and buses, all within walking distance, which was great. In-unit washer/dryer was awesome; we made use of them a couple times. Couple downers: We got roped into an ""owners briefing session"", which was just another time share sales pitch. While we don't regret buying the time share, we had no intention of getting more. After hard selling us for over an hour (during which we repeatedly indicated our lack of interest), the salesperson had an abrupt personality change and couldn't wait to get rid of us when he realized he wasn't going to pull more money out of us. It was quite off-putting. We won't be doing that again. We valet'ed our car while we were there. Not sure if they didn't have enough valets, but we often had to wait long times for the car (upwards of 15-20 min) to be delivered, and there was usually no valet around at the counter when we came by (at different times of the day).","Seattle, Washington","621aaronk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",6,4.0

I was disappointed this property doesn't have a fitness room. There is a small one available at a sister building. The rooms are great, full kitchen, washer, dryer, etc.. only silverware and plates for 4. I didn't give it a 5 star because I had to wear earplugs to sleep nightly. This property is roadside and I could hear every passing vehicle And the beep beep of delivery trucks and tour buses that arrive very early. If you're a sound sleeper it may not bother you. The property is clean and well located near its own market place and the iconic Tower with its colorful rainbow colored mural gracing its side. It brought back memories of the original Joni Mitchel song later famous by the Counting Crows ..."" they paved paradise and put up a parking lot"". After reading previous Trip Advisor posts, we did try eating at Tropics by the sea walk and enjoyed to music. They only take reservations for large groups. Music began at 5:30, we arrived at 6, there was already a line. The food was good, had a mushroom pizza. We did not eat at Tapas as others suggested because it felt land locked within another hotels outer area. They do have their own music. You can use your passport given out at check in for a 10% discount. At this time the sunset is around 6:30-6:40, very well worth watching nightly. There is a walkway and areas to sit at, bring your own drink in a plastic container and camera and enjoy: no reservations needed. I found the sunsets to be more colorful here, beating out Key West- A naturalist explained that it's due to ""vog"". It's the fog caused by the eruptions of the Kilaweah volcano from the island of Hawaii. The sunsets have more pinks and purple hues that continues lighting up the horizon well past the actual sunset. Within the hotel complex there is a Marketplace with several places to eat. They may not be seaside but you can take to go. I highly recommend Blue Water Shrimp. We are there twice and their portions are abundant to share or save for later. The squid or calamari steak was superb. Check it out. The prices for chairs and umbrellas are high. The Hilton says they don't control that. See picture for poster with rates. You can sit on towels, then move to chairs poolside or walk to nearby Walmart and buy your own. It's a choice. There are small store mixture of food and items called ABC stores, can't miss them. There are over 40 in the island. Every other store is an ABC. The hotel is well located within walking distance to MC Donald's, Subway, I Hop, lots of variety nearby so use your google maps to see. Overall, it was a good experience to savor Hawaii. We took a Viator trip to Hawaii to see volcano, well worth just full day. We also did the whale watching out of the Honolulu port aboard the Star of Honolulu, great trip saw whales. The bus system is available at bus.org. Check it out, convenient and reasonable for $2.50 each. Hawaii and its history is unique and adds a different dimension to what I knew about our US History, as Hawaii became a state in 1959.

We are HGVC members and have stayed at a few properties. The Hilton property is in a great location; one end of Waikiki beach on a wide strip of beach. On 2 mornings we walked the entire beach which was a lovely walk past different hotels & people watching. The complex of hotels has a 'village' of shops in the middle and some decent hotels spread across the properties. I can see that you could spend most of your vacation in & around the Hilton complex and have a great time!When I booked I was told that the Grand Waikikian was the best of the hotels on the property. Certainly the suite was very well laid out and appointed to be extremely comfortable and functional for 2 couples. One of the best properties I've seen in that regard. Common facilities in the hotel itself were excellent. All the staff we dealt with were very friendly and helpful. One thing that surprised me was that this hotel is the furthest from the beach of all the Hilton hotels on the property (not that far, but not on the beach) and our room faced away from the beach even though we had one of the higher categories of suites. Obviously there are plenty of rooms in the Grand Waikikian with great water/beach views, but it would have been nice to have one. Maybe there was a different room category for those with a view, but I didn't notice when booking. The only other thing I found odd was that they have a policy with valet parking that you can't call down and have them bring your car around but you are supposed to come down and only then ask for your car. Its a very small thing, but I use valet parking at dozens of hotels every year and the whole reason I do is so that I can call down for my car rather than having to go to the garage myself and get it. Someone said that it was because some guests had been calling down and taking a long time to arrive, therefore causing them difficulties. Sounds like they've decided to punish all guests because a few had been causing them problems. (""Customers can be such a nuisance some times!"")While I've highlighted 2 negatives I should emphasize that in context of the entire 1 week stay they are very minor and we entirely enjoyed our time at the Grand Waikikian. I would definitely stay here again, and would only find out what I needed to do to get a beach/water view.","Toronto, Canada","pr123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",58,4.0

Full Kitchen, washer and dryer, quiet, clean, comfortable beds, etc. No complaints about the room. I don't really have any complaints about the property but I think people visiting should know the following.Hawaiian village is made up of several hotels and Grand vacation towers. The closest to the beach is the lagoon tower and the rainbow tower. I did not know that before booking and while I could see the beach from my balcony, it was a 10-15 minute walk from Grand Waikikian to the beach.You have to rent chairs and umbrellas - chairs are $15 each and umbrella was $30. You can keep them from 8am - 5pm. They will boot your out of them at 5pm sharp! we could get up and go get lunch and come back. There is no butler service. The beach is not maintained so watch your step. I did not see anyone raking the sand or cleaning up. Not so say that did not happen after 5pm, I personally did not see it. This place is HUGE so get a map and use the friendly Concierge, bellmen, and front desk staff for directions. This is not a place I would bring anyone people who does not like to or can't walk a lot. I would never bring my parents here. You have to walk far to get to everything. There is no restaurant in GW so you have to walk into Hawaiian Village of off property. We did 10,000 steps a day while there and we were not trying. I barely get 2000 steps at home!!!If you want to save money, go to the ABC store or to a local grocery store and pick up cereal, eggs, bacon, lunch meat, etc. DO NOT buy groceries in the lobby store. A box of frosted flakes cost $10.95. Hawaii is expensive in general but prices on the property are ridiculous. The pools looked so much bigger on the website. They are not large, so they are always packed. There are a lot of kids and noise. If you want peace and quiet this is not the place for you. Its hustle and bustle. Honolulu is in an extremely populated area and all around you will see high rise buildings and traffic. This is why I prefer the big island or Maui. I was with newbies who wanted to see Peal Harbor,etc.Best place to eat for us was DUKE's!!! Drinks and food were excellent!!! Its a WALK from the hotel or you can spend about 10 bucks by cab.We did not rent a car but some friends did. There was a $39 dollar a day fee for parking. Valet was more. We walked most places so i'm not sure we needed it but if you really want to get around the island I would recommend renting a car.You must visit the Polynesian Cultural Center. the play there was awesome---not the luau----the play. It is an all day adventure. You learn all about the different Polynesian cultures that thread through Hawaii. Each has a village with two to three buildings/huts and they do presentations about their cultures, traditions, dances, clothes, etc. The walking was minimal b/c in each village you stop, sit and listen. the next village is close. There are only about 6 of them. One of the cool things was most of the workers in the different villages were from that actual island. Of course, there are restaurants/food stands and you can buy food packages. The hotel has a shuttle for $23.00 ea one way. it is about an hour drive and you follow the coast to get there so its a scenic drive. Beware, the shuttle stops at different hotels to pick up and drop off - it's only about 5 though. We took a cab going ---big mistake $$$$ and took the shuttle going back. We were the second drop off.The luau at Hawaiian village was okay. This was my third one in life, I've had better. it cost about $114.00 if you are a member. This luau does not show the pig coming out of the ground---if that's important to you. I don't like my food looking at me so I could care less but some people want the full experience. The Hawaiian pork was on the buffet and it was yummy!!! the food was luke warm though.If you are an owner make sure you get discount books from the concierge. If you are not an owner, you need to talk fast b/c they will try to get you to attend a time share presentation for 90 minutes of your life. The book has discounts for the different restaurants/shops in Hawaiian Village and the luau----at those prices you want all the help you can get. Now, consider yourself informed!

Overall, we liked the place and had a great time. However, I did go in with low expectations. I had stayed the Hilton Hawaiian Village before so I went in knowing what to expect. What to Know:1. The property is pretty new. Our room was clean and pretty big. We packed into a one bedroom. The kids on the sofa bed and we were on the king. The rooms were actually soundproof so I could get up at 5 am watch the news while my kids slept. 2. Don't expect to do much real cooking. Overall the kitchenette was nice and very useful. I loved being able to make my kids eggs and pancakes in the morning vs. spending $100 on breakfast. The little store in the lobby sells eggs, juice, pancake mix and other goodies. However, the space is small and there are limited kitchen items like bowls. I wouldn't want to make a gourmet dinner there. We ate one night at Hula Grill which was AMAZING .I would recommend making a reservation there.3. The HHV is a 15- 20 minute walk to Waikiki. I actually thought of this as a bonus. The beach is a little bigger and it's actually a bit quieter. Waikiki could be described as a huge mall on the beach. You could actually not even pack clothes and just buy all your resort wear in Waikiki. There is everything from Prada to Forever 21. 4. You will get charged for beach chairs and umbrellas. We only did this one day so i didn't sweat it but i you are staying for a week it could really add up. I think the umbrella was $35 a day. Maybe more. My kids and husband also did a surf lesson. They loved it but it was super expensive. I think more than we paid for the room.5. The ""partial ocean view"" is a view of a building and a busy street. I didn't mind this but I wish I hadn't paid for it. 6. The service is bad. It's a condo type place so they are not into service. We got in late and I asked if the bed would be made up for the kids when I checked in. The woman at the front desk said oh it should be. Of course it wasn't and we had to wait 45 minutes from someone to deliver sheets. Not a biggie really. The thing that made me laugh was when I was filling up my water bottles and noticed there is a sign that said guests can have free refillable water bottles just ask the concierge. The first woman I asked said they were out. The next day I asked again and the woman gave me such a hard time about the stupid water bottles. She grilled me about staying at the hotel and then told me that my reservation said I was paying zero dollars each night. I wasn't. So weird to be so rude like I was asking for something crazy. If they don't want to pass out the water bottles they should just remove that sign. They are just cheap collapsible bottles anyway.

It's got all the things that you would need for a family vacation for first time visitors to Hawaii. However, where they fall completely short is the bedroom. We have what they call a Suite with two Double beds, in the Grand Waikikian. The room is ok in size and amenities, the beds are the problem. We are a typical American size family, and my wife and I are squeezed into a Full size bed, while the little one, is on the other bed. The beds are not Queen size, like you are made to believe in the pictures or wording, but are just slightly smaller than a Full size mattress. It's definitely not suitable for a couple to sleep on. After spending over $3000 for the week, I get to sleep on the pull out couch each night. After speaking with someone from the front desk, I was told that ""these are the largest beds they had throughout the entire Hilton Hawaiian Village"".Second, like everyone has said, parking rates are a complete disgusting fee of $32 USD for self park and $39 for valet, and that's PER DAY!!! The hotel will say it's due to the Hawaii traffic, urban area, etc. Basically, they should be embarrassed to charge that much for registered guest.Other than those two main items, it's a fun place for the kids and family. It's not for retirees that want peace and quiet by the pool side. It has the same concept like Disney World, where everything is done well, but for a price. If you keep that in mind, you'll be fine. But if you and your spouse or significant other, want to sprawl out on your bed after a long fun day, then you won't find it here.

While suspicious about the ""upgrade"" we rolled with it (OK so they ""sold"" it to me by noting it had in-room laundry...kids, family, yes this is a consideration) The upgrade was anything but....the room was nice, spacious (although not alot of luggage storage space), full kitchen was handy but the city view? NOISY!!! I am going out on a limb and saying I would not have heard all of the trucks and backup sensors on semi's that are in the loading dock at 3am if I was in the Lagoon tower garden view room?!?! Oh well, a few more details:Full sized fridge, oven/stoveApartment size washer & dryerCoffee maker, toaster, rice cooker, blender, all utensils, etcWifi was free in the room, couldn't get connected by the pool but that was OK for usNice sized bathroom but a warning that the door from the living area and the door from the bedroom overlap and also block access to the closet (weird set up but livable...just be cautious at night to not walk into 1 of 3 possible doors)Bed was a bit soft, pillows were puffy and large (I love it, husband does not...depends on preference)Pull out sofa was comfy according to the little people (they were exhausted so they could have slept on the floor and not known it...take the review of that bed for what it is worth)We found the water was weird - it left a film on anything in the dishwasher and all over the sink. Not a big deal but just a warning if you are using the dishwasher.The amenities at the Hilton Hawaiian Village are too numerous to note but you have full use of the whole property. It is truly a village onto it's own and you have little need to leave if you are looking for a one-stop resort. This tower is a 3-4 min walk to the Paradise Pool (kids pool with waterslides - awesome but also busy) and the same distance to the lagoon (awesome too - salt water but no waves for the kids, fun to swim and rent water toys). Overall we found this tower to be clean and the staff very welcoming. This tower shares a lobby with the Lagoon tower which is nice as it has it's own driveway, cab line and check-in desk away from the main lobby (just visit the main lobby on a Saturday if you want to see how busy that can be!). Only negative was the direction of the room - avoid the city view (aka loading dock view) if you are looking for something quiet. If you are wondering about the Hilton Haw. Village as a whole - it is remarkable! Truly a great resort with lots of pools (and space around the pools), beach, rentals, activities, fireworks...the list is too long.To avoid being too long I have separated reviews for the restaurants. (Room service/Fresh connection is a NO, Hau Tree Pool restaurant NO, Tropics is better, Pizza is OK, Ice Cream is YES, CJ's Deli is a YES...........)","Calgary, Canada","Marbles20</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",80,4.0

The views were great, the rooms clean and spacious and the dining and kitchen areas exactly as advertised. With small children we cooked most nights and used the washer/dryer daily.

We booked a two bedroom and a one bedroom, as our grown children and grandson travelled with us. We had the one bedroom, which was spacious for two people. The suite included a sitting/living room with an attached kitchen area, a bath, and a bedroom with king sized bed. The bedroom had a large jetted tub, and the bathroom had a shower. It was very quiet,clean and comfortable. The kitchen was equipped with table settings for 4, although with 4 people, I think it would have been a bit crowded. It was perfect for 2. The kitchen also had cookware, a rice cooker, toaster. Our unit was near the end of the building, and although it was supposed to be partial ocean view, it was much more city view, and if you looked off the end of the lanai, a very small partial ocean view. The 2 bedroom occupied by our children had a very nice partial ocean view off of their lanai, so we appreciated the view from there. There is a sundries store on the main floor of the Waikikian that carries sandwiches, cut fruit, and snacks, drinks and souvenirs. If you intend to cook, I'd suggest visiting the Foodland Farms store in the Ala Moana Center, not far away. It is an amazing grocery store, and if you give your phone number to apply, you can get a card that yields a 10% discount on your purchases. Rooms at the Waikikian are equipped with washers and dryers in the rooms. Many visitors complain about the dryers in their reviews, and here I have to concur. Perhaps they are steam dryers, and my family couldn't figure them out correctly; I'm not sure why they seem to be very slow to dry even a small load. I did find that although clothing seemed moist when you removed it, within a minute or so it seemed dry. I often hung clothes for an hour or so after removing them from the dryer to make sure they were throughly dry. The resort has multiple swimming pools, plus a lagoon for swimming, paddle boarding, using aqua cycles etc. Water sport equipment can be rented by the hour. We only used the paddle board, which was $35 for an hour. Our 8 year old grandson loved that lagoon, and learned to paddle board with ease. There are many restaurants and shops in the Hilton complex. We used the ABC stores to purchase souvenirs and snacks. We also ate at Benihana, which was great, and the chefs put on a fantastic show. Tropics offers light lunches, and the staff are knowledgeable about food allergies, which is important to us, as we are gluten intolerant.  I've read many reviews that were critical of the staff for not being friendly enough. I couldn't differ more with that view. Every staff member we met was friendly, welcoming and helpful. Many went out of their way to insure we had a nice stay. As owners, we vacation with family often with Hilton Grand Vacations Club. We appreciate the good service, and pleasant, clean accommodations they offer. The Grand Waikikian is a great place to stay, and I'm sure we will return.","Washougal, Washington","Mamashu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washougal, Washington</strong>",85,5.0

The rooms were very clean, nicely furnished and nicely set up. The kitchen in the suite was also very nicely appointed and quite large. It had everything we needed. The view wasn't the greatest because it faced the street instead of the beach which I guess was due to lack of funds on our end. We only went to two of the many pools they had and I didn't like them very much. The entire time we were at the pools we were constantly hounded by birds, most likely due to all of the fools that feed them. The pool grounds also weren't the nicest. For the price we paid I would expect the pools to be a little nice and grounds to be a little more well kept. The lagoon was very nice, a lot cleaner/better kept grounds than the pool areas. It was very convenient having the rental place at the lagoon.I wouldn't return to Hawaii in general as it is so overpriced for what we get.

The kitchen is very nice sized and they give you all the things you need, plates/utensils/cups/pots/pans/etc. They even provide the detergent for washing dishes, using the dishwasher and doing your own laundry in-room (note that the dryer is electric so it took a bit of time for it to really dry the clothes). Viewing from the kitchen is the balcony which has four chairs and being so high up, you get a nice breeze.The bedroom itself is average. We had two double beds and there was enough space for two people to walk around. The beds themselves were comfortable but seemed a bit worn. Laying in the bed over the few days, I felt like the bed sank a bit. The pillows are also very dense; they are not the fluffy light kind of pillows. There are plenty of outlets around to charge electronics and a nice touch was the USB ports in the phone. The one thing about the bedroom I did not like too much was the bathtub in the room. I didn't use it as I was concerned there would be too much humidity in the room as a result. The room itself is super quiet. I don't think I every heard any noise from any other traveler.The staff at the hotel is outstanding. Maintenance was quick to come up when issues arose and quickly fixed the issues. Valet parking was quick as well and after a while, they remember who you are. Note that self parking is available and is right behind the hotel for a savings of $7/day. The store on the first/second floor is very reasonably priced for their drinks and food; did not feel like I was being charged too much. The only thing I felt was a bit much was the resort charge of $30/day, something lower might be more reasonable. They do however give you cards to get 2 free 16.9 oz bottles of water per day as a result. Additionally, they give you a card for DVDNow which allows you to borrow movies and PS3 games for free for 24 hours.Location-wise, you are about 30 minutes from Honolulu airport and close enough to all the sights. North Shore is only about an hour or so away. Being in Hilton Village, you can get picked up for all your tours in the back or at the entrance of the other Hilton hotel (5 minute walk max). There are a lot of trinket stores around as well which is convenient. Overall, the hotel was nice and relaxing for a family since you can spread out.

The vouchers were dated 2015 and stated that we had to collect the water from the concierge in the Kalia tower which seemed strange. We went over there and waited for 20 minutes to see a concierge and eventually gave up as it looked that the person being dealt with was there for the duration. We went back to our reception and pointed our that this arrangement was a bit ridiculous. We were then told that we could collect the water from any concierge - pity that they did not tell us that when they gave them to us. They promote a free orientation walking tour of Waikiki which happens every weekday - after half an hour of the tour and having visited 4 of the shops on the complex we dipped out of the rest. Do not know if it did anything other than extol the virtues of the local businesses after we left but I have my doubts. There are several reasonable restaurants on the Hilton site and in the local area (if you like Indian food there is a good restaurant across the road on Ala Moana Blvd).

Without it I wouldn't be able to visit some of the places I've been and enjoy a vacation every year. That being said, to say I'm a planner would be an understatement. I plan ahead - way ahead. Therefore I made my reservation at the Grand Waikikian 9 months in advance of our trip. My wife and I and another couple were celebrating our 45th wedding anniversarys so we decided to go to Hawaii. This would be my second stay at the Grand Waikikian. The first time was just my wife and me and we stayed in a one bedroom on the 17th floor. It was a huge room overlooking the city and the mountains. Because of the occasion and the number of points, our friends decided to split the points with us for a two bedroom premier accommodation. We anticipated an ocean view which we did get. But the rest of the story isn't so grand. A month before our reservation I began contacting the resort requesting a certain room layout. I didn't want to have a king and two full size beds for two married couples. So I contacted the resort managers and forwarded them a picture of the accommodations I was interested in for our stay. This picture came from the HGVC website as one of the floor plans for the different types of accommodations. It turned out we got a shotgun layout that was pretty small by comparison to the one bedroom my wife and I had previously. It was ""okay"" but not anything like what we requested. Not even for making a reservation so far in advance. In fact, we felt rather cramped. I don't remember this from our previous stay, but there is very little storage space in this two bedroom layout. It was not sufficient for two adults with full suitcases to put everything away and out of your suitcase. The living area was small and only had a couch and one chair. There are caveats. And maybe that is why we didn't get the accommodations we requested. We were only staying for 4 nights and then moving to the Big Island for a week to stay at Kings' Land. But my friend whom we shared a room with is HGVC Elite. The reservation was in his name, but that didn't help. The area itself is incredible. In other words, Hilton Hawaiian Village is a fantastic place. But I was disappointed with our accommodations, especially since we had planned this so far in advance. One tip for the uninitiated traveler to the Hawaiian Islands. If you think you are going to go on a shoestring budget, forget it. Hawaii is very expensive. Even with accommodations provided by your HGVC membership, food is VERY expensive. One suggestion would be to have breakfast or/and supper at the Wailana Coffee House. Great place for breakfast right across the street from Hilton Hawaiian Village and very reasonable prices for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. We enjoyed our stay in Hawaii, but our first stop on Oahu, and the accommodations we had at the Grand Waikikian wasn't as enjoyable.","Savannah, United States","George L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Savannah, United States</strong>",27,4.0

We are faithful Hilton customers and elected to try one of the brand's Grand Vacations properties with great expectations. I'm sorry to say that they missed the mark. When we checked in the young lady at the reception desk was very polite yet lacked something. Her command of the English language was less than satisfactory - we had difficulty understanding her. It appears that this property caters to a clientele from the far east and that English was a second language for her. We were told our room wasn't ready but we would receive a text message when it was. After waiting 2.5 hours we checked back with the reception desk - the desk agent seemed surprised that we hadn't already been notified; she then told us it had just come available. To say we were disappointed in the room is a gross understatement. We elected to stay in a studio unit; little did we know that meant a room situated behind an elevator shaft with barely enough room to walk on either side of the bed or that the tub wasn't big enough for me to even sit in (I am 6 feet tall - my back was against one end and I couldn't fully extend my legs). We wanted to view the Friday evening fireworks so we asked where best to see them; it was obvious that my wife has limited mobility and unable to stand - the desk clerk told us the only place to sit and see the show was the beach- my wife can't even walk on a beach let alone sit-down and expect to get back up. The fact that the pool deck offered both seating and a view was never mentioned. The property is beautiful, the weather spectacular, the sea view breath taking; however, it is difficult to overlook the shortcomings.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Susan N Bill S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",73,4.0

The apartment was large, well appointed and spotlessly clean. The same could be said for the public areas. It was very comfortable, good, free wi-fi and located at the beginning of Waikiki Beach and a150 metre walk to the beach; no roads to cross. There is a central resort village, various food outlets and boutique stores. The property is situated on a 5-6 hectare beachside property. Staff were friendly, helpful and efficient.So why have I given the resort an average rating? I had not appreciated that there were 7 Hilton properties on the site, towers with over 3,000 rooms and an eighth tower is in construction, pushing the room count above 4,000 according to a very proud staff member. They did not appreciate that the sheer volume of people during this week in September was overwhelming. Everything was crowded and this detracted significantly from the general amenity of the resort. Also, resort pools were both relatively small and too few in number for the population. A large artificial lagoon also provided swimming opportunities and then it was a short walk to the beach. Waikiki beach 'proper', the middle of the beach is a fifteen minute or so walk. There you will find the big name boutiques and many restaurants.There are few off resort restaurants proximate to the Grand Waikian.Should you walk in the other direction for about 20 minutes it will take you to the Ala Moana Mall - enormous for those who enjoy such places. As you might gather, I am not one of those people but my wife assured me it was terrific and not, as I asserted, a level of purgatory.There are frequent buses running outside of the hotel, two dollars a ride, exact fare only, no change. Most of the booked tours pick guests up from the same place and the concierge team is incredibly helpful in assisting in finding and booking tours and activities during your stay.This is a mixed review, we enjoyed our holiday, appreciated the apartment, service and public areas but were overwhelmed by the crowds. If I were to retturn to Honolulu I would stay mid beach in a smaller hotel.In fact if I return to Hawaii, I will stay on one of the less populated, more scenic islands.","Melbourne, Australia","L5954JUjohnb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",34,3.0

Check-in went smooth and it was time to relax. One thing I noticed was that I had to sign a disclosure that we would not smoke in the room. Since it was a non-smoking property, I ask the question, ""Am I getting a smoking room?"". They replied that all rooms are non-smoking so you are fine. When we got to the room, it was evident that the last person in the room smoked in it. My daughter and I are sensitive to smoke and didn't feel that we should stay in the room for our entire trip. Therefore, we went back to the lobby and requested a different room. The clerk introduced us to the ""Resort Manager"" to go over our options. He noted that the entire resort was filled to capacity. This place is huge and to think not a single room wasn't available is hard to believe. I asked for his manager and he said they are all gone for the day. The ""Resort Manager"" was more like used car salesman. Really didn't care about my situation. We ended up staying in the room for one night, packed up and requested a new room. The following day we were given a new reservation in a similar smoking room sprayed with some sort of air freshener. Bottom line it was a joke.

Before coming to the Hilton Hawaiian Village, I read lots of reviews that basically said it was a fine but outdated and old hotel - and those reviews are right, except for the Grand Waikikian (GW) tower. The GW is newer and much nicer, so I'm glad we picked this tower to stay in. So if you're coming to Honolulu and you are a Hilton member and have to stay at one of the Hilton towers in the Village, pick the Grand Waikikian! We had a one bedroom suite that had a beautiful modern kitchen, hardwood floors in the living room, and a spacious and comfortable bedroom (with a huge tub in it as well). The bathroom was also very nice and modern. The resort itself is very touristy with your basic touristy shops and restaurants (obv), but the laua was definitely worth the price! The beach is close and nice, and the pools are fine (too crowded and to many kids for my liking - but there's bars at every pool and the drinks are good and reasonably priced - so there's that). So if you're coming to Waikiki and you can't afford a five star hotel, but can afford the Hilton, go with the GW and you won't be disappointed/you'll be pleasantly surprised/satisfied.","New York City, New York","CJ R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",5,4.0

We had to move because we didn't have enough points to get a 1 bedroom plus for the entire 7 days. I asked if we could combine our 2 rooms to just stay in one room. They told us because one was a 1 bedroom and the other was a 1 bedroom plus we couldn't do it. Our first room was a ""city view"" on the 21st floor which we could not use the balcony because of the noise. We were there for 3 nights and then had to pack all our things and put them in storage, check out and then check back in but we couldn't get our room until 4pm. That was OK as we went hiking and had an early dinner. We got our new room which was a ""partial ocean view"" room for which we used more points. We were moved up one story to room 2212 which was right around the corner from our old room (but one story up). The ""partial ocean view"" turned out to be a tiny sliver of ocean if we leaned over our balcony. We couldn't see any ocean if we just sat on the balcony...what a joke! And to top it off the room was even smaller than our first room! There were so many kids in all the hot tubs that we couldn't even get in. Why they don't restrict this is beyond me. It was so disappointing as my husband and I like to relax in the hot tub and to make it even worse they close them at 7pm! We had spent the previous week in Maui and stayed at the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Villas and they had an adult only hot tub and it was open 24 hours. The Grand Waikikian resort is so busy and congested that we will not be staying here again.The staff was very nice and we had no complaints with them...we are not complainers but this stay was not what we were expecting.

The Village is huge with many restaurants, shops and things to do. It can be overwhelming! The Grand is newer and seems more upscale than the other hotels on the property. We loved it! We are part of the Hilton vacation club and there is a review that states it's Saturday - Saturday. Perhaps most in the club stay those days, but we actually went Monday - Monday with no problem. I do wish checkout was 11 rather than 10. 10am seems a bit early when check in is at 4pm. Our 1 bedroom suite was nicely appointed with a large bathroom and a mirror that didn't steam (fantastic!) along with a huge tub that was in the bedroom. There are two double beds in the bedroom and a queen pull out sofa in the living area. There was a Bosch washer & dryer and the kitchenette had everything we needed to prepare simple things to eat. We were on a higher floor overlooking Ala Moana and that suited us fine. We enjoyed looking at the harbor from the balcony and the city lights at night. This view also kept us from hearing the Luau up on the rooftop of the garage every night! One night may have been fun, but a week of that - no thanks! Our balcony was large with one table and four chairs. The lobby and hallways and elevators were always clean. This hotel is a nice experience throughout. Speaking of the Luau, it was fun! It was pricey, but we enjoyed the convenience of having it right there and easily walking back to the hotel rather than a long ride to the Polynesian Cultural Center. Another benefit for us was all the vegetarian food offerings. Other Luau menus we had viewed had far less to offer those of us who don't eat meats. The food was fresh & tasty. The dancers and host of the show were entertaining and often funny. It was an enjoyable evening. The Village is also convenient with it's great lawn area for pickup. Several of our excursions picked us up in this location. Had I realized the cost of parking and that we'd only use the rental car a couple days I wouldn't have gotten the rental at the airport. There was a car rental place right next to the GW on Ala Moana. I would have rented those specific days only. Many excursions will pick you up and even Uber is priced well for getting to close by spots in town. The entire hotel complex is a busy place. It has very large numbers of people staying here. We are happy we booked just after New Year and not during the Christmas/New Year holiday itself. It must have been crazy then. Despite the amount of people we had no problem getting chairs or umbrellas for the beach area. The pool was often more crowded, but even there we found chairs. My one huge gripe is the cost of beach chairs and an umbrella. Paying $60 for an entire day is one thing, but when you've been on an excursion most of the day and can't get beachside until 2 or later, $60 was ridiculous! Why isn't there a reduced price for late afternoons? We would absolutely and happily stay in the Grand Waikikian again! Now that we know a few tricks such as renting a car by the day only and not bothering with the beach unless you plan a full day for the chair rental price, we are set. We already knew to eat breakfast simply using the kitchenette or go across the street and buy a delicious acai bowl. If you choose the G.W. I can't imagine being disappointed. It is a nice place to be if staying in the Waikiki area of Oahu.","Santa Rosa Beach, FL, United States","Sandra L.

Total mob scene. About 25 people (including two babies in diapers) in a hot tub despite the sign limiting it to 9. Not an empty pool chair in sight at any of the pools. The beach is a little... ""man made-ish"" and requires renting chairs and umbrellas... Towels were given out on a ""chit"" basis: you needed to return the towel for the chit or get charged... but the towel return sites kept closing/moving and it all added to the hassle and long walk when you just wanted to be done and get back to the room. The onsite restaurants had hourlong waits at dinnertime, adding to the stress. Service at the restaurants was minimal/cursory at best (separate reviews).All that said, the two-bedroom suite was beautiful, I have to say. Up to date, very spacious, with beautiful bathrooms (though the lack of privacy for the master bathroom shower meant only one person could use that that entire bedroom while showering - indeed, my husband gave the window washer quite a show (and shock!) during one of his showers! It was nice to have laundry in the room. I liked that there was a little village to shop/wander during downtimes (including a few ABC stores, which are always fun), and I didn't find the convenience stores IN the hotels over-priced, either.We attended the hotel's New Year's Eve luau as well, which was decent, particularly considering their record crowd of 940 people. The show was great, the food quite good (though there was a long wait) and there was easy access to bars/servers.Ultimately, we used it as base camp for Oahu - we ate mostly in Chinatown (yum) but should probably have rented a house or apartment instead, given we didn't really use/appreciate the resort ""amenities.""","Boston, Massachusetts","Racwoh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",59,4.0

If you are a first time visitor to Hawaii, you probably will be coming to Oahu and you should probably stay here, since it is such an iconic destination.This is a large touristy resort but it certainly delivers. The overall experience was highly positive and I recommend it 100%. With that said, I am going to try and guide you through some of the pitfalls that I learned in staying here for 8 Nights and 8 Days.The Village itself is 7 (Soon to be 8) Towers situated on the western end of the Waikiki Beach Strip. The towers are Kalia, Tapa, Rainbow, Lagoon, Diamond Head, Ali'i and Grand Waikikan.To really make the most of your time/dollars/fun factor, I would highly recommend getting one of the HGVC rooms here. The HGVC is the Entire Grand Waikikan Tower, The Lagoon tower and floors 12-18 of the Kalia Tower. We stayed at the GW Tower, which was great. Standard HGVC Kitchen/Suite with fold out bed in the living room, but the tub in the Master is a big Jacuzzi style one. My daughter inquired if she could move in....to the tub. The Lagoon tower is between the GW and the Ocean/Duke's Lagoon so unless you are above floor 28 or so, you wont see much, but It doesn't really matter since its nice to sit outside regardless of where you are. We were on the 10th floor city side and didn't even really think that it was an issue for a second.If you do not stay at one of the afore mentioned towers, you will not have a Kitchen. Therefore, no bananas, yogurt, eggs, toast, etc.... from your balcony in the morning (which was an 8am highlight everyday). The real problem here is time, not just money. If you are here with a 2 year old, and you are just going to be sitting in the resort and at the pool, fine. But if you are looking to hike, surf, swim, whatever, you will be wasting 2-4 hours a day eating, waiting in line to eat, determining where you want to wait in line to eat, cursing the day you ever came to this godforsaken place!!! But, with the Kitchen, everyone wakes up, grabs some food, meets on the balcony, and it's off to the activities by 8:45! Remember the Village is busy!I've heard a bunch of people complain about the rooms in the Rainbow and Tapa tower being small and outdated, so staying in the HGVC rooms solves this problem too, especially since the GW is the newest tower (and the 8th one appears to be a replica of the GW tower.)Everything is very expensive, including the Luau, which I thought was a ripoff. If you are going to do the Luau, don't buy the gold tickets, just buy the blue ones and get there precisely at 5pm. It's still a little touristy/gimmicky, and the only really cool part is the fire portion which has to conclude by 7:45, since the fireworks begin then on Friday.Ahh yes, the Saturday checkout. Fortunately, we did a Monday-Tuesday stay since I just use the HGVC properties as hotels not time shares. However, all the time share guests must be out by Saturday at 10am so it is quite a scene at that time. I had to return some rental surfboards at 8 and the madness had already began. My advice...don't be anywhere near the lobby at Saturday at 10am. If you absolutely have to leave on Saturday, I would check out Friday, move two blocks to the Alana Doubletree and stay there the last night. It's that bad.ActivitiesJust a few things. Don't rent a car unless you plan to do excursions everyday. We went on a Surfing Tour with a 3rd party (ohanasurfproject.com) and rented a car from Paradise rental car(next to the GW tower) for another North Shore day. Parking is too expensive and the valet is too much of a mess to make a car worthwhile.Lunch/DinnerYou will probably go to Dinner once or twice per week in the Village, but it will be expensive. Three of us went to Benihani and it was $275. We went to Korean BBQ a short walk away and stuffed our faces for $75 with drinks. If you like Asian food, get out there and explore! Also, check out the food trucks for lunch. Everyone makes their own version of Garlic Shrimp, try for yourself.All in all, I highly recommend the Village for your first Hawaiian experience as long as you stay in the GW tower, and don't get too engulfed in the tourist experience.4.75 Stars rounded up to 5 =)","Detroit, Michigan","Barry L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Detroit, Michigan</strong>",8,5.0

To start off, I have been to Hawaii years ago with a friend as solo travelers. This time around, I was treating my family to a Hawaiian vacation as my Christmas present to them and needed spacious accommodation for 4-5 adults. After extensive research on Tripadvisor, I narrowed down to booking a suite at Hilton. I quickly learned that most of the 1-to-2 bedroom suites at Hilton are timeshare units. There are 2 timeshare towers (and another coming!) in the Hilton Village - Lagoon & Grand Waikikian. For the most part, you'll have to book through 3rd party sites or timeshare brokers to get a suite in either towers. And sadly every listing looked suspicious as they are using stock photos from Hilton website and they mismatch the photos with the different towers. When I contact a timeshare owner and timeshare broker, they were asking for $4900 & $6700 for the week of Christmas in the Lagoon tower. (Say whaaa, right?!) I started to research more to see if there is another way to booking a suite, especially at the Grand Waikikian. And then I stroke GOLD! Hilton.com had the 2-bedroom suite with City-view (1 King & 2 Double beds) available for 6 night in the GW. Now to the important part - the hotel & suite!Grand Waikikian is a luxurious hotel/timeshare tower with a modern Hawaii decor. It reminds me of the California Adventure Hotel at Disneyland California Park. It also secluded from the rest of the resort/Waikiki Beach so you have less crowd to deal with. We were greeted upon arrival with fresh leis. Check in was speedy and pretty straight forward. We arrived on Sunday afternoon and got into our room within 20 minutes. However, it was a nightmare on Saturday morning when checking out. The elevators are packed with people and large suitcases. Since it's a timeshare, all guests are required to check out at 10am on Saturday and so it was a stampede of families into a small lobby. Because of this, I deducted half a star despite the hotel's effort to control and ease the delay by having all man on deck. As for the suite, it was better than I had expected. The kitchen is stocked with mostly Cuisinart appliances and cookware. The living room and dining area are spacious and well-designed. The bedrooms were simple but extremely comfortable. The bathrooms were beautiful and clean. There are some minor wear and tears in the suite, but again, the whole suite was better than I had anticipated and my family were extremely happy with the accommodation. As for the amenities/activities in the Hilton Hawaiian Village...The pools were crowded but manageable. They had plentiful of shops and restaurants. The local beach had decent waves, but a little more rocky than the main Waikiki beach. The luau on Friday on the Great Lawn was fantastic! The show is 360 degrees so everyone has a great view and the firework show is right after! I've been to the Paradise Cove Luau and this was better despite having less pre-dinner activities. Do not do the luau on any other day as it is less spectacular. I know because our patio overlooked the main luau area on the conference hall rooftop and got to see the show every night.Overall, I would definitely stay at Grand Waikikian when my family and I visit again.

We were looking to go somewhere exotic like Turks and Caicos. Then, I came across an incredible deal for a week at the Grand Waikikian. I was rolling the dice since Hawaii was getting hit with 3 hurricanes at the same time. The price was simply too good to pass up, so, we booked it even though it was only my wife and I. It was a week in a 1400 sq ft 2 bedroom penthouse suite on the 36th floor for $1495. We normally go to stay in the Ali'i tower in the hotel, but this was cheaper. Luckily, the hurricane passed the day we got there. My review might be very biased because all of the factors were not normal from the price to the type of room.I'll start with the building. It's definitely a newer tower, but there was no real personality or presence. We really didn't need to interact with any of the staff at the front desk because the Penthouse level rooms have a team dedicated to their needs on the 35th floor. That being said, all staff other than the waitresses seemed to be native Japanese speakers. It would be great if I was from Japan and couldn't speak English, but for my purposes it was a little difficult and I'm Asian myself. It would make more sense to get second generation Japanese that can speak both languages fluently and easily handle both cultures. Getting a cheese grater for our kitchen was a 2 day job trying to explain what a cheese grater was to 3 different members of the staff on the 35th floor. Coolest selling point of the Penthouse level was the free continental breakfast in the mornings as well as the evening appetizers with beer and wine. Be sure to try it every night as the menu does change. Certain nights are significantly better than others. Thai night was probably the best in my opinion. Some more thought should go into the menu for this premium service. For the limited number of people that can access this amenity, it would make sense to add a few hot items to the breakfast and step up higher end food options in the evenings. Also, if you're going to have free beer, giving more options than just Budweiser would have been nice. There is a single beer at a time rule in effect, so, no double fisting and going to your room.Regarding the room, it was new, nice and spacious which is hard to find in Waikiki. I have no idea how much a room like this would go for nightly, but I imagine it would be incredibly expensive. Take a look at the pics on the Hilton website to get an idea of the room. 2 bed 2 bath unit with separate pull out sofa in living room, breakfast bar, large round dining table, full kitchen, 3 balconies, and large jacuzzi bathtubs in each bedroom . The theme of not just the room, but also the building itself, is a natural Hawaiian style decor with a lot of natural wood. I like more of a clean and modern look. While nice, it felt like I was sleeping over at a rich aunt's house rather than a staying at a luxurious hotel. But at the penthouse level, I can't say that it was anything other than the bomb.If you have a choice of ocean view side, choose the side that faces Diamond head. You will also then be able to see the fireworks on Friday and Saturday night if you are high enough. We didn't have a choice and we were on the other side. We just got to hear the fireworks.Regarding the pool area, if you have kids, this is the pool for you. For adults like us, we had to use the other pools that were more quiet. The pool area was a zoo and a little like a trip to Disneyland. Not an ideal place to relax. Also, when we came last November we were told that they were going to do a much needed update to the Mandara Spa locker rooms and facilities, which is long overdue. The men's locker room looked like a YMCA from the 80's. The Spa is the same and they only did ADA upgrades. Quite a let down. The Spa facilities are so sub par for this property. It a bit of a shame.Final thoughts, great stay for the price. After seeing the price of studios on the lower levels on Expedia, I would pass on staying in this particular tower again. Ali'i is still the best in my opinion, but I've never stayed in the Rainbow tower.","Los Angeles, California","EP348</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",30,5.0

While we stayed here before, this time was the most disappointing. I'll start with the positives - the amenities are great, particularly if traveling with small children. The lagoon is perfect for kids as it is shallow and very calm. We had so much fun with the kids here.The room, however, had definitely seen better days. We had a two bedroom suite. I'll start by saying that when we first checked in there was the odor of bacon in the main area. Then, we discovered that the trash hadn't been removed and there was no dish soap left. So, we called housekeeping and they came to take care of that. They even commented that they thought the room smelled funny and suggested that we have them use their ""air machine"" to get the smell out and they were surprised that this hadn't been done in the first place. Well, we never had a chance to do this as someone was always in the room. Beyond these issues, the floors felt really grimy, and not just to me, everyone in our party commented (it's Hawaii, so we were barefoot a lot). So, I actually spent the time to get down on my hands and knees to clean the floors. I also ended up scrubbing the counters, cabinets in the kitchen area and backsplashes. They were all filthy.I don't know if this was an isolated incident with our room, but it was REALLY disappointing. I'll also say that I'm an HGVC owner, though I didn't use my points for this stay. The quality of this property leads me to question my ownership.","San Francisco, CA","orangeguy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, CA</strong>",25,3.0

We are HGVC owners but didn't know anything about this property prior to arrival. If you are flying into Honolulu International Airport, reserve a taxi pickup in advance. The taxi stand at HNL is the worst we've ever seen. Our confirmed Charlie's Taxi driver picked us up within 10 minutes which saved at least 30 spent waiting in that loooong line. Charlie's is also the hotel's official outbound cab as well. Right away, you will find that the Grand Waikikian is an expansive property. (My fitness tracker estimated a half-mile round trip between our room and the Paradise Pool.) GW is one of seven towers that make up the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort. Our one-bedroom unit was nicely decorated and very comfortable. We had an ocean view room on the 23rd floor. The room is furnished as any other HGVC property--everything you need here to cook, do a load of laundry etc. The elevators (4) were prompt enough. When a big group moves in, it can overwhelm the small elevator lobby. Because the rooms are equipped with kitchens, there is no restaurant or even coffee shop in this tower. If you want the livability of a condo with on-site meal service, this isn't your property. Easy check-in at the spacious lobby. There is a small store near the elevators for food, toiletries, etc. they have a nice selection from sushi to soft drinks, frozen foods to fashion magazines. There are several concierge stationed throughout who can help book outside activities and also serve to guide you to HGVC presentations. We hadn't planned to attend one while we were here (the ""owner's update"" is mostly up-sell) but the $100 toward a helicopter tour reeled us in. Beyond the GW tower, the entirety of the HHV encompasses more than you might imagine. The property is arrayed around the Mid-Pacific Conference Center and bordered by the Pacific Ocean and Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon. There are tons of places to eat, shop, swim and relax within HHV. There is even a post office/FedEx business center here. We walked a few blocks for groceries and along the beach but you wouldn't need to leave HHV if you don't want to.The first thing you need to do here is take advantage of the free walking tour. Justin B. was a fantastic guide: knowledgeable, personal and fun. We discovered a few places that were not obvious (the Italian place is easy to miss) and sampled lots of goodies from the shops, from coffee and chocolate to cookies and cake to nuts and ice cream to smoothies and an obscenely good coffee butter. Certainly there is a commercial aspect to this tour but you get so much more--a history of the property, an introduction to the beautiful flora and fauna found on the grounds, a little architecture appreciation, knowledge of Hawaiian and Polynesian traditions. DO NOT MISS THIS TOUR!There are other on-site opportunities that we did not personally experience. From our room, we looked down on the luau; the fire show and dancing looked and sounded like good entertainment. We will not be here on Friday when there is a special show for those on the property (modest cost, paid thru room charge only to limit to guests). It features music and a fireworks spectacular. Both these would appear to be interesting attractions. While in Hawaii, we like to hit the pools. First day was Paradise Pool off the Grand Parlor. It has slides etc. for kids. Not a bad pool which attracts families. We moved on to the Kalia pool next--a small pool with nothing other than towel service and perhaps the best sun exposure of any of the pools. Did not try the Super or Tapa pools as there are enough palms to make sunning there a little challenging. (Hey, it's Hawaii--we are going back home with tans.)The beaches and lagoon are terrific. Note: these are public beaches so don't come thinking they are reserved for property guests only. There is a jetty near the lagoon where surfers gather and we witnessed wedding photos being taken at the lagoon. Actually, every day we have been here (5) there was a wedding function somewhere on the property.Staff have all been very helpful and friendly. Can't say enough about Justin's walking tour. We enjoyed drinks and pizza at the Tapa Bar and also a nice meal at Tropic. Many will comment that this location is as much metro as beach and that certainly is true. Several cranes poke through the skyline as other hotels rise; flights from HNL and excursion helicopters pass over with regularity. From our balcony, there is road noise from the sometimes intense traffic. Yet the walkway along the beach and the green space of neighboring Fort DeRussey park can be relaxing. The night life in the village can be boisterous and invigorating. There are lots of people--couples and families from all over the world--who come together in the HHV environs which may or may not be your idea of a vacation. Bottom line: If you are looking for a serene, secluded tropical island paradise, the Grand Waikikian HGVC may not be what you are looking for. If you want a little bit of everything--a nice beach, lots of nearby activities, on-site shopping and entertainment with generous big-city off-site options and a global vibe, this might work nicely.

My mother needed a wheelchair and asked whether we can hire one; as she was told they will charge $70 for a week, she said it was free of charge in other hotels we've been staying in Hawaii. The Japanese female staff suddenly became hostile and snapped they do things differently here (sounded almost like some sort of school headmistress!). Somehow we felt that young Japanese staff members did not like experienced holiday makers like ourselves. Often we see bell and front desk staff just milling around, conversing among themselves- we wondered what they were doing instead of helping us. Usually older staff were more helpful and efficient, perhaps they were not training younger members equally well.

We took the advice of many other reviewers and did not get a car. We used Spedi Shuttle to get to and from the airport, but a taxi would have been about the same price. Grand Waikikian is situated in a way that was easy for pick up and drop off for taxis, shuttles, and tours, so it's easy to get around. We took a tour to Hanauma Bay for Snorkeling, and that was wonderful. You can get access to a lot of tours from the hotel. My favorite was the sunset cruise that leaves right from the pier at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It gave us spectacular views and was so relaxing. We set up the tours ahead of time, but there are discounts if you book tours when you get to the hotel because they give you a big coupon book. It is easy to walk around the area, and worth the two-block walk to Market Pantry, a real grocery store with better options and prices than the nearby souvenir stores. Get food from Market Pantry to prepare in your suite's kitchen. I wish we found it sooner. The souvenir stores and store in Grand Waikikian Tower are very expensive.The suite was breathtaking. It was so much larger than I expected. The patio was almost the full length of the side of the building! We booked a 1 bedroom suite with a city view. It was a gorgeous large comfortable room with a wonderful view. The tower is nicely situated on the resort, and it's easy to walk around the resort, to the beach, and to neighboring restaurants and shops. The resort is terrific. We enjoyed Benihana's and Bali Steak House and Tropics. Tropics was a great outdoor bar to relax in, but honestly we spent a lot of time at the outdoor bar at the hotel next door too. It's easy to find a place on the beach to unwind with a Lava Flow or Mai Tai and listen to live music. It was so relaxing to hang out by the beach. It was also relaxing to get a couples massage at The Mandara Spa. I couldn't imagine a nicer place to stay on Waikiki Beach!

The Rainbow Tower is the closest, and the Lagoon Tower is just in front of the Grand Waikikian.

I was surprised by the $29/day parking fee. I had not been told about this when I booked the reservation although they did give me a heads up about the Hawaiian State Tax which added over $50 to my overall bill for the week. Now for the more positive aspects. The room is as you would expect from Hilton, clean, comfortable and luxurious. The beds were super comfy. Clean towels abound. Dining and shopping are within walking distance as are several pools, a lagoon and a beach. The lagoon is a small manmade lake of ocean water with a shallow sandy bottom and beach. It has fish and you can rent pedal boats, paddle boards, etc. We didn't do any of those things, but the lagoon was nice. There is a large touch screen in the lobby which you can use to print boarding passes. However, my flight wasn't listed, so it didn't work for me. The night attendant at the front desk (yes, I procrastinated until 11:30 the night before we left.) was very helpful and we were able to get my passes printed out. Wish I knew his name.

The Grand Waikikian (GW) was a great place for our family. We had a room that overlooked the beach and lagoon. The kitchen was stocked with appropriate utensils and the beds were very comfortable. Since we were there for a little over a week, I loved the washer and dryer in the room so we didn't have to pack so much for our 2 week trip (we went onto the Big Island after a week at the GW). Our 11 year old loved the DVD/Playstation. While he enjoyed much of what HHV and Hawaii had to offer, he was also excited to play a few games ""to keep his skills sharp"" and we watched a movies at night and in the morning as a family.This is a ""self-service"" experience, housekeeping comes once a week and the concierge seems to be more of a sales agent for HGVC. As an owner this wasn't a surprise to us but if you are paying for a room or using points, something to be aware of. The little market off the lobby (Accent) was great and if you'd rather there are a number of ABC stores on the property to buy coffee, snacks and other necessities.If you want to be right on the water (rather than a few steps away), there are other towers on the property that are closer. We didn't mind the few extra steps since the Paradise Pool was literally right off the lobby (a family favorite). The HHV property is ""like Disney"" in that there is everything you can imagine on the resort and they get you coming and going on price. The only thing we wished they had had was better room service (because even with a kitchen there are times when you just want to kick back and watch a DVD without fixing your meal). The only thing that kept this from being a 5 is the internet was AWFUL and the air conditioner didn't go a great job at cooling the room at night (not sure why - the thermostat said is was cooler than it felt).","Nashville, Tennessee","VickiE809</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>",60,4.0

I am always used to the bog standard hotel room, the two beds, bathroom, tv and if your lucky a mini fridge and rubbish courtesy coffee and small kettle but this place knocked that out of the ball park. This is a full apartment fully fitted and furnished. A fully equipped kitchen with fridge freezer and ice maker. Cooker, microwave, coffee maker, dishwasher, washing machine and separate tumble dryer and every appliance you could ask for. Dining table, lounge area with surround sound tv and sony playstation. A bedroom with a fantastic kingsize bed another tv, huge bath for soaking in watching tv and another seoerate bathroom with a huge walk-in shower. You could honestly move in and live here, it has everything. I was actually arriving back and saying we are home. Also had a good balcony and a fantastic view over the beachfront area. The staff are fantastic, it is modern, clean and looks so new you could have been the first people there. You pay more for the stay here but when you consider we had a cooked breakfast every day on our balcony with fantastic views it was well worth it.It is set within the grounds of the 62 acre Hilton Hawaiian village on the prime location of waikiki beach. There are plenty of shops, bars and restaurants around the complex but you can pay a bit more due to the location. The grounds are fantastic, lots of ornamental ponds and waterfalls filled with koi carp and 5 swimming pools around the complex. The only drawback is it can be busy. The HHV is open to all and the place has various towers in the complex. Diamondhead, Ali'i, tapia, kalia, rainbow, lagoon and grand waikikian towers, so if you think your going to be on a golden deserted beach with no one around you will be dissapointed. The place can be packed especially on a friday night when they have a show and beach firework display open to all. It is a fantastic location and only a 10 minute walk to the ala moana shopping centre, more bars and restaurants than you could ever need and a vibrant night life. Overall a fantastic place to stay. My favourite places in the village was Benihanas Japanese Restaurant, where you sit at a table with your chef cooking your food in front of you. Round table pizza,(the kalua pig supreme has to be one of the best pizzas i have ever had), and next door Lapperts ice cream bar for dessert of a freshly made waffle cone and a double scoop of delicious ice cream (Mauna keys secret,vanilla with a raspberry swirl and chocolate fudge brownie pieces for me).....absolutely heaven. Fantastic apartment in a fantastic complex in a fantastic location. For me it was perfect but may not suit people wanting a quieter time. Be warned at the moment they are building another tower so there can be some construction noise around the diamondhead and tapia towers, especially the tapia pool and bar area, i was so chilled i hardly noticed it.","Chelmsford, United Kingdom","Mikejonm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chelmsford, United Kingdom</strong>",42,5.0

Staff was nice, common areas beautiful. We went in late June and we always had a place to sit by the pool. The lagoon is absolutely the best! We rented a paddleboard for $29 for an hour and had a blast. We also utilized the professional photography service by the lagoon and Joseph was just so accomodating and a total pro, highly recommend! My biggest complaints are: 1) We were on the 8th floor and even though we booked a ocean view, it was not that great. I knew it wasn't great because everytime we went to the concierge and told them our room number, they said, oh, sorry you are on a low floor. 2) There is a large window in the bedroom and in the kitchen that only had a sheer, no blackout drape.

The accommodations were nice, upscale, but the air conditioning system is VERY weak. Yes I am aware that it goes off when the balcony is open. It is VERY weak when operating properly.Beware of the concierge, they are not a true concierge, since they will only push to sell you what HILTON offers, not help you with finding out other services, or facilitating communication or navigating through your other non hotel interests. The Luau, it was BEAUTIFUL, HOWEVER extremely expensive. we paid about 110 per person, and the food was ok, but the buffet was promptly picked up after 1 serving. ridiculous. The ""free"" maitais were marginal at best. The show was nice, the dancers superb and talented, but I would recommend doing some research for other luaus that are less than 100 per person, and not in a parking lot rooftop, which is where this one was, pretty disappointing and non Hawaiian-eske.The pools are nice, and are FULL of kids, which is ok, but the hot tubs should be adults only, and the staff barely enforced the age rule or occupancy rule in the hot tubs. I often saw 5,6,7,8 year olds packed to the rim in the hottub without supervision, and surely making it warmer with their pee. There is really no adult relaxation area in any of the pools so be prepared for that. The beach and lagoon are beautiful and no complaints there. The hotel itself is beautiful but there are about 5 towers that share the grounds, so you will see thousands of people all the time. It is expensive to eat everywhere, so take advantage of the kitchens in the suites. The dvd service worked well, and we watched plenty of movies. Don""t be fooled by your status, pr preferred guest experience card, or whatever they call it, like a VIP card that you are supposed to show and get ""perks"" or treatment. It means nothing. You are just a hotel guest, and will be treated like everyone else.If I was to return to the island again, and not staying with my folks at this place, I would look for something smaller, more quaint, maybe zero amenities, but on the north side of the island, where there are DOZENS of virgin beaches, with beautiful views. Maybe a B&B or something. There is a beach about every 3 miles on the north side with breathtaking views and feel.

Great place. Checking in took a little too long but then again I was checking in over a dozen of family members in various rooms. The check-in staff did a great job not only getting us on the same floor but all in the same section - literally across the hall from each other. Rooms were awesome with all the amenities. Loved the kitchens with everything you need and then some - of course a coffee pot but it also came with a blender, rice cooker a more. Especially loved having a dishwasher and washer/dryer. Plenty of dish and laundry soap, coffee etc. We asked for more coffee and received plenty within minutes.Waikikian is part of the Hilton Hawaiian Village which may be huge but has numerous pools, a large beach, a lagoon and plenty of shopping. Since this was a family vacation with kids we spent most of our time at the pool next to the Lagoon Tower complete with two hot tubs, three slides and waterfalls. The kids loved it. I liked how the attendants were ready to help with an answer to a question or getting our food order but not pushy at all. They did a great job staying in the background.

We stayed in a one-bedroom suite and it did not disappoint. The room (separate bedroom, living room, kitchen) was nicely appointed and was very spacious. The bed was very comfortable and the room was nice and very quiet. The full kitchen was nicely stocked and was modern in design since it's one of the newer properties as part of the Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV). They are building a new tower which should be completed in 2017. Everyone on staff was helpful and friendly, from the front desk to the bell personnel. We stayed for 7 nights and never had any issues with our room or cleaning schedule. I went with my girlfriend this time so for the two of us, the suite was more than adequate in size. When I stay with my kids (ages 13 and 9), it's better to request a 2 bedroom suite in the Lagoon Tower for the extra beds. Otherwise, it would mean squeezing them onto the sofa sleeper in the living room. The property is right next to the lagoon and steps away from the beach. It is close enough to the main stretch of Kalakaua Ave. with a short walk along the beach to get to the main shops and restaurants. We didn't eat at any of the onsite restaurants, but we did go to the convenient onsite ABC Store daily for drinks, snacks, sunblock, etc. Since it's away from the main stretch of Waikiki, it's quieter and you can always find an open spot on the beach to lay out without being too close to your fellow sun worshiper. The property is also close enough to walk to Ala Moana mall or a short 5 minute drive by car. Parking fees are a bit ridiculous ($37 / day) but the nearby parking structures are convenient and we never had any problems finding an open spot. Overall, the Grand Waikikian is currently the most luxurious of the properties in the HHV. They will ask you to attend a timeshare presentation, but just say no and you won't be bothered the rest of the trip. It's a wonderful property with a fantastic location and I would definitely stay here again.","Campbell, California","kystone25</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Campbell, California</strong>",12,5.0

There is also a lagoon area exclusive to those staying at the Hilton and has rentals for paddle boards and paddle boats. There is also a surfing spot you can paddle out to from the hotel front.

This time, though - Honolulu was necessary. Relatives who ""own"" with Hilton Grand Vacations recommended the GW - and they were spot on. From the gracious presentation of leis/kukui nuts upon arrival to the ""owners' lounge"" available for those with late flights on departure day - the whole of our stay was relaxing. The tower is airy and beautiful - individual suites are casually elegant, well appointed (with American and Japanese small appliances in the kitchen) and quiet. There are numerous restaurants (for all budgets) and shops (not for all budgets) right on the property. ON Waikiki Beach (no road to cross), it's also an easy walk (one road to cross) to Ala Moana Mall, which has all the usual suspects, a cheapish food court and a GREAT used bookstore - Book Off - if you are looking for cheap beach books in English or Japanese.As for the beach itself, there is a sea wall near the hotel, so kids can paddle safely. The sea wall was also home to a remarkable number of sea cucumbers, urchins, crabs and fish. I was VERY surprised at how many creatures my son ""discovered"" in the heart of Waikiki. The rock-pooling is still FAR better at Ko Olina but you are a long way from anything down there.Friday nights there are concerts and fireworks (as seen on Hawaii Five-0). What a treat to watch the fireworks over the ocean from our balcony. Happy days, indeed.We had a car and found it relatively easy to get in and out of the self-parking. The parking is not cheap, but last year at Ko Olina (which is in the middle of nowhere, comparatively) parking cost $8 MORE per night. Build it in to your budget as yet another tourist tax.Two resort caveats: 1. The GW hot tubs were only open until 7:00 PM - and they were often full of tiny children, despite signs stating ""No children under five"". We were relaxing in the spa one night, when a man got in carrying a child wearing only a swim diaper. 2. The pool area - on the weekends - gets ""visited"" by local kids who hover around waiting for somebody to leave the gate unlocked, etc. Much as I dislike the wristband police (as seen at Waikoloa) - perhaps wristbands have become a necessary evil at the Waikiki pools. A pool full of kids (or indeed anybody) in grubby street clothes doesn't really fit the tone of the resort.Obviously these problems are ultimately the responsibility of rule-breakers - but I would have liked to have seen the property deal with the two above matters head on. I mentioned it to staff, and they just shrugged. Probably hard to police, but even so...NB: There are no private beaches in Hawaii, so remember that the ""lagoon"" outside the pool gates is open to EVERYONE, including the homeless guys that wash their clothes in it. Ultimately - I would stay again, the resort exceeded my expectations.","Greater London, United Kingdom","KittyMack</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greater London, United Kingdom</strong>",4,5.0

This is a great place, and you can't find anything to complain about. There are restaurants right within the complex - there are something like 7 towers of condos/hotel rooms all adjoining and there is a steak restaurant, a tropical restaurant, a starbucks, a great buffet breakfast (Ok, $29.95 is ridiculous, so eat plenty.) A private lagoon, snack burger bar, tons of free stuff to do. And tons of expensive tours to do. My one and only beef is that our building had no workout room, you have to go about 4 buildings down. Beautiful furnishings, upgraded kitchen (we had a 2-br). We had the 18th floor partial ocean view room, and it was truly lovely - overlooking the rainbow tower, and the lagoon, plus the beach. Expensive? Yes, Hilton Quality and Hilton Pricing? Add on Honolulu crazy pricing? Yes. But the food was literally to die for. EVERY MEAL!!!

I chose this resort largely due to the reviews on Trip Adviser so I feel compelled to write a bit about our experience. Overall, I felt it was average at best, contrary to the glowing reviews. I will start with the pros. The value of the room was good in my opinion. The room we stayed in was large and reasonably up to date. The beach at this location is fantastic for kids. They have a very large beach area in addition to the lagoon. My kids loved the beach. The property is nice and there are lots of fish and animals for the kids to look at. My 2 year old really enjoyed the fish. Now for the cons: Service was poor. The front desk staff was unhelpful at best. The concierge was even worse. I asked if they could help me find size 5 diapers nearby and they simply told me to go to Walmart. I also went to book a luau however the one at the hotel was booked. I asked the concierge if there were any other vendors for the tickets or if there were any other luaus nearby that we could use instead and she snapped ""I have no idea"" and moved on to the next guest. I requested late check out since our flight was not until evening and the staff would only extend it until 11am. Regular check out time is 10:00am which made for a very long day with no where for the kids to sleep. Food - This was the biggest disappointment. There are many places to eat on the property but we found the food quality to be poor. The food was generally flavorless and poorly executed. It was also very expensive, which is to be expected somewhat at a resort, but a pancake breakfast for 2 adults and 2 kids shouldn't be $96. I will qualify this by saying we are really into food and have pretty high expectations for it. The food here was a half step below Chili's or TGI Friday's quality. Location - It is located at the far end of the strip so there is not much in the way of food within walking distance if you don't like the food on property. This meant that we had to either eat the poor food there or deal with getting a cab and driving somewhere several times a day. Overall, I would not stay here again. The service and food just made it an unpleasant experience.","Dallas, United States","Haley B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, United States</strong>",2,3.0

The hotel does not offer any food service. You must leave the hotel to find a place to eat. For lunch and dinner this is OK, but for a quick coffee and Danish in the morning go hunt for a Starbucks and stand in line for at least 30 minutes. Also, there is no fitness facility in the hotel.

All the rooms on our side of the hotel look out over the street and the ocean can only be seen from the balcony and even then it's tiny and between 2 buildings. The worst thing was the traffic noise. We had to have the balcony doors closed the whole time! The building is a time share and because of this there were no rooms to move to nor to upgrade to. The manager could not help. If it was not a time share we would have upgraded to a better room but this place has around 95 per cent occupancy. the room was very nice, 1 bedroom, but it's a 10 min walk to the beach. We ordered pizza from Wikki Pizza, it took more than 2 hours NOT to arrive. I went to collect it after calling them and when I arrived it was siting in the warmer and the server said she would make a new one if I waited for that, after 2 hours I just too the luke warm pizza. By the way Wikki Pizza is really Fresh Connection, so you can imagine how long it took me to find the place called Wikki Pizza when there no shop sign saying Wikki Pizza only Fresh Connection. Why? I would not stay here again and would not stay at a time share ever again. We foolishly bought the 7 day pre-paid package when we stayed in New York Hilton, booking the place was a nightmare really because of all the international phone calls and as we ""only"" booked 3 months in advance, you would think that might be enough, but they were only able to give us limited options. Apparently their website says what a partial ocean view really is, for us a Street views with a bit of water if you go out on the windy noisy balcony. We tried to get lunch at one of the Hilton Village restaurants near the beachfront. it was just after 2 PM and even though there were lots of empty tables, we were told it was a 10 minute wait! Why? Avoid going to the time share type sales fest, that's how we got stuck with this establishment. By the way check in is not until 4 PM so if you are coming from Australia it is very annoying after a long flight. We were told that they would call us if a room came up, they didn't but we spoke to a helpful male check in person who got us in earlier than 4, whereas the female check in person did not put herself out to call and say we could get an earlier room. If you are from Australia you will probably be very disappointed with a partial ocean view. I don't think the the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would let the Hilton get away with such a misleading description of the room. I pity the manager having to defend that description when it's so obviously a city view or road view. I gave it 2 stars because the room is very nice. Two bedrooms on the ocean side would have been better but we not available when we booked. Mind you I haven't seen the rooms so I would check out the guest photos if you are tempted. The cleaners on our level were great.","Singapore, Singapore","Dmor12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",25,2.0

There was a big greeting and the staff couldn't do enough to help my family and I. We got to the hotel early so the room was not ready which we knew would likely be the case. However the staff were able to accommodate our request to check in early within a couple hours which was great because the kids were tired. The staff throughout the stay were excellent.We were in a one bedroom apartment which had a full kitchen and laundry which came in handy during the 5 night stay. The room was super clean and spacious, which met our needs with the two kids. We had a partial ocean view, which was nice and allowed a view of the fireworks on Friday night that the resort runs each week.The Grand Waikikian was the best option in the Hilton Hawaiian Village as the rooms were large and had the best pool. It was also very close to the man made lagoon and beach. The Hilton property itself is massive but has plenty of facilities including more pools throughout and a nice spot on the beach. The hotel is less than a 10 minute walk to the big Ala Moana shopping centre which was convenient. It is about a 20 minute walk into the main part of Waikiki but it was a nice walk and was a good way to get some exercise and stretch the kids legs.My son loved the pool at the Grand Waikikian which had multiple water slides, all of varying thrill levels.This was our third visit to Waikiki but our first to the Grand Waikikian.

The Hilton Hawaiian village is HUGE. It is a city unto itself. You could conceivable spend your entire vacation within the village (which would deprive you of the real Hawaii). There is so much to do on their property, and they do it well.The Grand Waikikian Suites are located at the far end of the property. The entrance was a little tricky to find in the night, but once you drive there, you will find it again easily. If you stay at this property, you may consider renting a car for only part of the time as do not need a car in the Waikiki area. There are buses and taxis available to move up and down the central area. What you will pay for this transport will probably be comparable for the parking fee that you will pay to store your car at this property. There is no street parking here.The entrance to the hotel was packed with vehicles upon our arrival, but the valets did a good job of moving the crowd along. After being initially annoyed by the crowd (probably due to a 16 hour travel day), I was impressed that we got through so quickly. Yes, chill - you are in paradise!Upon entering the lobby, I was struck by its quiet, understated elegance. The check-in area is located in an open-air area, and was nicely appointed. Check-in was quick and painless.We had reserved a two-bedroom unit. The elevator to our wing was a bit of a walk from the lobby; but, as indicated, this property is quite large.The unit was nice. We had 2 balconies: one off of the living room and one off the second, smaller bedroom. This actually worked out nicely in that one couple had the benefit of the master bedroom with en suite bathroom and the other couple had the benefit of the balcony. Everybody wins!Our balconies were truly enjoyed. We were located quite high up. Our living room balcony faced the water, and the second balcony had a street view (with a water view far to the left). We enjoyed coffee in the morning on the main balcony, and I spent late nights on the second balcony immersed in my book. Although it was a city view, it felt private and serene due to the height.The remainder of the unit consisted of the full-sized kitchen, small dining area and small living room area. There was a sofa bed in the living room. Two adults slept on it and they were fine. I did find that the common living areas were smaller and less spacious to the Marriott Vacation Club units in Ko Olina.The Hilton unit is a little older than the Marriott. It was in very good condition, but if they do not continue to maintain it, it could easily slip into feeling dated. It's not there yet, but the modern feeling is missing.The lack of ""newness"" is more than made up for by the sheer greatness of the Hilton Village. We had planned on making breakfast in the unit, and even bought groceries in the convenient (but a bit overpriced) ABC store that was downstairs (an on every corner of Waikiki). Coming from the East coast of the USA, the time change saw us non-morning people awake early every day. We decided to try the hotel breakfast buffet the first morning as we were feeling lazy the morning after our long travel day.We were initially annoyed (yeah, I know - paradise) by the fact that the hotel breakfast buffet is located in another building located a nice walk away from the GW. After walking through the beautiful grounds and along the beautiful beach, we arrived at the restaurant. Although crowded, we were seated fairly quickly.The buffet was $40 per person - pricey for a hotel buffet. But what a buffet! Choices, choices, choices! In addition to regular breakfast choices (omelets, sausages, bacon, waffles, pancakes, etc.), there was seafood, Asian cuisine, carving stations, etc. It is more of a brunch buffet than a breakfast buffet. We thoroughly enjoyed this buffet. In fact, all ideas of cooking breakfast were disregarded and we ate our $40 breakfast every day of our stay. There were no complaints about the expense as we felt it was worth it. After the buffet here, we didn't need to eat lunch. It is also important that I add that the wait staff at the restaurant was among the most outstanding of all the hotels during our visit. They were truly an exceptional set of people.We spent our first recovery day relaxing in the Hilton Village. There a multitude of stores to stroll through, beaches and pools to visit, and places to discover. I could see spending a week at the property simply because it would behoove you to dedicate two days to simply enjoying the resort. It would be a mistake, however, to miss everything else that Oahu has to offer.I enjoyed the property, and would visit here again.Happy travels!","Miami, Florida","MIAChels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",147,4.0

After arrival we walked to the nearby Wal-Mart to stock up on groceries then explored the grounds of this huge property. This tower is very well-maintained. Our suite was modern and beautiful, everything worked perfectly. The beds were very comfy and our family of 2 adults / 2 teens had plenty of space. The elevators were fast, which was important because the kids were always eager to get out to the pools and ocean. We loved using the mornings to walk along the beach walk, then return along the street. It's a busy vibe here, which is just what we were looking for. The beach was crowded but not so much that you couldn't find a spot for yourself. I give the property / room 5/5 but there were a few downsides when we compare it to other places we've stayed - getting into the ocean at this spot is difficult due to very sharp rocks right near the edge. None of us could walk in, we had to sit down and either float over top of the rocky area (only a foot or two deep) or crabwalk out. I ended up with a bad cut on my hand doing this, and my husband cut his foot. Once you get past this though, it was nice swimming. The snorkeling out further was OK but you are quite close to the reef and there's not a lot of clearance. The Paradise pool that was closest to our tower was always packed. We were lucky to find a single chair to put our stuff on which was OK since the kids were always in the pool anyway. This is a popular spot for very young children, so if you want to relax in the hot tub you can't do it here - there will be a small child cannonball in every few minutes with no parent in sight. One afternoon we came through to find that it was closed for ""sanitation"". It was opened again the next day. The lagoon is beautiful! Although we never swam in here, it was a popular spot for people trying SUP or kayaks. The bazaar is a really neat spot, and we went there every day just to peek in windows and take in the atmosphere. Shave ice was very good, but expensive here as we found later on in our trip.Overall this a great property and we would for sure stay here again. We didn't really need staff often, but they were helpful and friendly. We loved our leis on arrival, that was an unexpected touch! There is lots of shopping nearby, including several rental car agencies across the street. Due to a severe allergy in our family we are unable to eat out often, so it is wonderful when we can find a kitchen suite in a nice hotel so that we can prepare our own food but still get the hotel experience.","Calgary, Canada","sararussell13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",28,5.0

The Grand Waikikian is part of the Hilton Hawaiian Village property so the property is huge and there's a lot to do. I liked that there was a lagoon which was perfect for my 2 year old who wasn't so fond of the waves on the beach. She was a lot more comfortable playing in the lagoon so that was perfect. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was nicely appointed. The appliances were a bit tired but it was still great as a family of young children to have a kitchen and washer and dryer. Loved that there were various activities for us to do on the property - unfortunately my kids were too young for the penguin club, but every Friday there are fireworks and also an outdoor movie for kids as well. The two complaints that I had was when we called to get coffee filters for the coffee machine (that is provided in the room) we were told that they don't provide coffee filters. Didn't make sense, why would you provide a coffee machine that needs filters but not provide filters. So after asking to speak to the supervisor we were told that they were out of filters, not that they don't provide them. That was a little frustrating when you aren't provided the correct information and also when you can't get the necessity to operate an appliance. Also we got a little card in our room offering us a free box of chocolates from the concierge, I made the mistake of going to pick up the chocolates - it's a ruse to get you to go see concierge so they can try to book you in for a timeshare session (we don't own any timeshare, a friend of ours does and let us use his for our stay).

Excellent customer service, from check in to check out, every employee always greeted us with a friendly hello and how can we make your visit better. The rooms were large, clean and nicely decorated. Both bathrooms had glass showers, one bathroom had a shower and large garden tub. The kitchen had dishes, flat wear, pots and pans, cups and glasses. Your also provided with a roll of paper towels, dish washing soap and laundry soap. complaints we spent 1700.00 on this package but received no Hilton points.The bedrooms got very warm at night.The pools, you can reserve your pool seat and people would go down early in the morning and reserve large groups of pools chairs, half the day those chairs would sit empty while dozens of people wandered around looking for a place to sit. Also there is no adult pool so don't plan on a relaxing swim, I love children but sometimes you just want a quiet place to relax, the pools here are not that place.Parking is 36.00 for valet and 27.00 for self. Self parking is actually much more convenient as the elevator to the parking garage is closer to the rooms, since most people tend to valet there were always several spots close to the elevator.As part of our package we had to listen to a 90 minute presentation, it was relatively painless and Paul the salesman only cared about what he was saying, he chastised us like bad school children every time we tried to ask questions, and he was not aware that Vermont was a state ( we asked him. About resort property in Vermont and he snapped you need to tell me what state Vermont is in if you expect me to look it up). But he was just a 90 minute irritant.For the most part it was a beautiful property though in a great location, the package was money well spent.","San Antonio, Texas","Jill V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Antonio, Texas</strong>",208,4.0

We stayed as a first time visitors to the hotel, as we along with my parents own a timeshare with the Hilton Grand Vacations. We wanted to get a feel of what the rooms would be like, and how hard or easy it was to stay.We are Kama'aina, and were celebrating my husband's 40th birthday. 1. No “early check in”. We were told that with the credit card, ALL we were guaranteed was a 4 PM check in. Nothing more.2. The floor in the master bedroom, there was duct tape on the transition from the carpet to the tile to the bathroom. When maintenance arrived, they pulled it up to see that there was missing carpet, and rather than fix it - they placed black duct tape over it.3. The surround sound out in the living room, sitting area - did not work. When Dan called to find out how to work it, after following the directions there were in the room we were told the surround sound doesn’t work.4. Dan asked where the remote for the DVD player in the master bedroom was, he was told to use the PS3 controller. So, basically there was no remote for the DVD player in the master.5. Magazine in the room that shows all their restaurant specials, Hastuhana’s was out of date. They had a happy hour special of 50% off sushi printed, and when we went into the restaurant we were told that that special was not active anymore for a year. They refused to honor it, even if the magazine was for Jan/Feb 2015.6. There were lots of dirty walls and a hole in the lanai screen. Dishwasher did not have the full cycle completed, so when we got into the room there was a beeping noise that took me a good 15 mins to figure out what it was. It was the dishwasher, and the door had been pulled open rather than run the full clean cycle.7. The biggest thing was that we felt like since we were not Japanese tourists, we were not the most important guests on property. We were told that the room we got were the “leftovers”. I think management needs to work on their customer service skills when it come to non-Japanese tourists/guests. I checked trip advisor’s website, and that seems to be the running theme for the reviews of guests that were not from Japan. I noted lots of guests from Australia that felt that because they were not from Japan, they were not treated with the same level of service as the Japanese tourists. So, when this happened to us - it wasn’t surprising. 8. Dirty sheets in the 2nd bedroom.9. I was told at check in that there would be no maid/housekeeping service. So, we made the “error” in thinking that the do not disturb sign was not needed. Well, apparently we were wrong. On the 1st morning we got an early wake up call when the maid knocked on our door yelling housekeeping, while also trying to enter our room. Supposedly there was an error made on their housekeeping sheet saying that the room we were in was vacant and she was trying to enter the room to change out the room binder. (This is the binder that shows hotel information, numbers to restaurants, etc) I had opened the door, and the maid appeared to be shocked that there were guests in the room. Overall, while we enjoyed the stay and the boys had fun - the Grand Waikikian has a lot to improve on. If anything next time, I would reserve a room at the Kalia tower or the Lagoon tower. I think we’d get better customer service and more consistent rooms.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Nicole D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",2,3.0

We have stayed here in the past...and enjoyed it...and, we enjoyed our time here again.Here are some pros and cons:1. While some items are expensive, for example $9.50 for a hot dog, much on the property was pretty much on par for other resorts around the world. We travel quite a bit, and we were not completely shocked by some of the prices. During happy hour, cocktails are $6---not too shabby. Look for deals, and you may find them!2. The Paradise Pool (with the waterslides) has been closed twice in the last 3 days due to 'issues'...to be honest, the issue is the number of kids in the pool! Today it was 'code brown'. Yuck! But, by having so many kids in the pool, accidents are bound to happen. We have a child with us---but, with potty breaks, accidents in the pool are unlikely! 3. We have a partial ocean view. We love looking outside at the beautiful water/ships/planes/people. But, at night, the luau and fireworks show and parties on the property tend to be noisy. The noise seems to be caught in a tunnel that reverberates noise into the rooms. We had a city view for 3 nights...not a great view.... but, quiet!4. Hotel is 7-10 minute walk to Ala Moana shopping center. Very convenient But, a bit of a distance to downtown Waikiki. Perhaps a 15 minute walk to the main street. A nice, safe walk, though. Bus stop are outside. And, the transit system is pretty cheap $2.50 (ask for a transfer!), and buses run often.5. Staff is very helpful and courteous. 6. Our 2 bedroom suite is spacious, clean and modern. We LOVE having a washer and dryer in suite. While it takes forever to dry our clothes (?), it is very convenient!7. ABC on site is great...one can stock up on essentials like water!8. While chairs at pool look hard to come by, we have not had a problem at all! We have found available chairs everyday!9. Drycleaning service is great....sent 2 blouses out in the morning...I had them back by the late afternoon!10. No daily housekeeping...only every 4 days or so...but, they are more than willing to bring up whatever you may need. 11. Free WIFI. Hard to log on at times, but it was FREE..and, after a few tries, we were always connected!Overall, we love the HHV site...and we really enjoy staying at the Grand Waikikian!

There are three pools that you share with other Hilton Hawaiian Village guests. One pool even has water slides, but skip it unless you really like children.

The only other recommendation I have is to renovate Mandara Spa. It's nothing like the brochure.

We took advantage of this since we had a 10pm flight out of town. The lounge had computers for limited use, a few televisions and lockers incase you want to get in a little more beach time before you leave. They have fireworks on Friday night and lots of restaurants and shops directly on the premises including car rentals. Some of the restaurants will deliver to your room, however we did not take advantage of this offer. The food is pricey but I guess this is expected. Our unit had a stack-able washer/dryer that took hours to dry two or three items. We called maintenance and they promptly came only to advise us that the dryer was not broken it just takes a long time to dry. We took an excursion to Pearl Harbor and to the Polynesian Center, both notable trips and worth taking the trip. There is plenty in the neighboring community some of which is just a short walk...restaurants, shopping etc. Overall the trip was amazing and I'd have a hard time finding anything about the city, the resort etc. The only regret is that we did not take an inter island flight to another island.

Overall, the hotel is reasonably good value for money. There are very few hotels that offer a two bedroom apartment (with kitchen) in central Waikiki. We have stayed at the Westin and the Royal Hawaiian. They are nicer hotels but they are not comparable in terms of room options. The Trump looks very nice but double the price of the Grand Waikikian.The hotel lacks character, especially being part of the enormous Hawaiian Village complex. I find the village area very old fashioned and a little run down. The size of the complex means there are always people everywhere. I prefer smaller crowds. The check in time is 4pm and check out is 10am, which seems a little unfair and inconsistent with most other hotels.The location of the hotel is excellent for the Ala Moana mall - within 10 minutes walking - but it is a bigger distance to the main Waikiki strip (still walking distance in the cooler evening). Not a big deal but just be aware of that.Our room was ok. It seems to be a little dated and the furnishings are starting to look tired. But it had everything we needed and plenty of space. We had a city view and the room (even on the 18th floor) was a little dark because of that. The pool facilities are large but they get very crowded. I prefer the pool at the Sheraton (which you can also access from the Royal Hawaiian). The kids enjoy the slides.We did not eat at any of the restaurants on property. There are plenty of good options nearby.I would stay at the hotel again. Not because it is a great (or very nice) hotel, but because it provides all the facilities you need in Waikiki and the price is not too bad.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","Crjcge</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",23,4.0

We had an awesome time, but we know what we like and if you're into sitting by the pool all week, skip this review. As far as I'm concerned, the Grand Waikikian was over the top nice, but we stayed only 4 nights and did Waikiki during the day only once. We rented a car for our week in Oahu and really saw a cross section of the island. Yes, it was $27/night to park, but everything in Hawaii is a bit expensive. There are not that many hotels outside of Honolulu, so commuting to different parts of the island is a very reasonable thing to do, just plan to avoid Honolulu rush hours. I was not overly impressed with the beach in front of the Hilton complex, and even cut my foot trying to swim there. It's a public beach complete with the occasional homeless person! There are much nicer beaches all over Oahu, some with giant turtles and great snorkelling. Hawaiian culture is really interesting and it's worth taking the time to explore, with or without a car. So for us, getting a city side view from the hotel was no problem since we had so many other great views during the day. In fact, I actually enjoyed our city side view. One minor quibble was difficulty finding the lobby from the parking garage, but once we figured it out it was no big deal. I just wanted to mention it's very possible to have a good time, even if you're not a crowd lover.

Enjoyed walking to nearby activities like the outside bars with live bands.Would love to visit again with our children.",,chitown_aka,22,4.0

We were really lucky and got two beautiful rooms we decided to switch halfway through our stay. The accommodations were quite nice and the kitchen was very accommodating. Fluffy pillows… Nice duvet covers. Hawaiian Village itself is busy and very touristy. When we first got there there was a large crowd of Japanese tourists. It's quite obvious the resort caters to this demographic and all the signs are in Japanese and there was a rice cooker in our room. My friend who I traveled with told me that we should probably check out another island another Hilton resort after our experience here. Don't get me wrong, the proximity of the restaurants shops and night life is great… It's just super crowded and really not my crowd. I appreciate a little diversity in my vacations but this was kinda crazy. I think I checked Waikiki off my bucket list… I'll go back if there's a great deal but probably never again. I would like to check out something a little bit more quiet and remote honestly...I would definitely not recommend this for honeymooners or couples.

The beach, lagoon, pools, and everything else available for families at the Hawaiian Village made this a vacation they will never forget. They all had a ball, and the resort itself certainly provides everything a family traveling with kids could every possibly need (albeit for hefty charges).That said, for the prices they charge, it would be nice if your business was genuinely appreciated, and that just isn't the case here.","Memphis, Tennessee","KenR3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Memphis, Tennessee</strong>",49,3.0

I wanted so bad to like the Grand Waikikian, but at the end of the day/stay it really was just average, at best. If you're considering the property you probably already know the drill and may even be a Hilton timeshare owner. If not, then expect about what you'd get at a timeshare, just in a high-rise setting. The rooms are plain and minimal in their decor. The kitchen facilities are adequate and in a place like Honolulu and Waikiki, the option to prepare even some meals on your own is a major cost savings...though getting the groceries themselves is not cheap. To that end, do not do your shopping at a store that begins the alphabet. The property doesn't really offer much on its own as it is part of the larger Hilton Hawaiian Village, which is really why you'd consider this property. The access to several pools, a lagoon, somewhat private beach and multiple restaurants and shops all on one property is really what makes the visit worthwhile. We did encounter some good staff who provided quality service, and had some less than fulfilling experiences with others. The staff that ran the surf school the day we participated was good but the whole thing was a disappointment. More time was spent on dry ground learning the fundamentals of surfing than actually out in the water. Once in the water it was a process of holding a rope to become next up in the queue, then get one try at catching a wave while the instructor yelled at the students...really wasn't much a 'fun' vacation experience. The entire staff of the HHV would be well advised to remember that the guests are there on vacation, to relax and enjoy themselves...HELP THEM DO THAT...it's not rocket science. There are a multitude of options across Waikiki, in most ways, the Grand Waikikian is no better or worse than they are. Keep in mind you are at the end of the stretch of Waikiki, so getting into the main beach or around the shops is a little walk or challenge navigating in your rental car.","Lake Forest, California","travelguyry</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lake Forest, California</strong>",20,3.0

My wife, two kids and I spent a week here, and as with most things in life we found both pros and cons. THE PROS: The Grand Waikikian is a beautiful building with great rooms and wonderful views of the ocean, the city, and Diamond Head. The room are well appointed with full kitchens, a washer and drier, balcony and large bathrooms. As a timeshare owner with Hilton I've come to expect nothing but the best in all of their HGVC properties, this one included. However, for 39 floors, four elevators screams bad planning. No one should have to wait 30 minutes for an elevator. And asking someone to ""deal with it"" on Friday and Saturday Check-in/Check-out doesn't cut it. The resort offers several pools and even though a lot of people on here complain about the crowds and the rarity of getting a lounge chair - I offer the same as above - deal with it! The place has a lot of people and they all want the same chair by the same pool at the same time. We found there was always room on the giant beach to throw a towel down. We'd spend the day at the beach or lagoon, and then cap the day off at the pool where we found plenty of seats and a cold drink waiting. THE CONS: Crowds everywhere - so make reservations and don't just show up at a restaurant or you'll wait and wait and wait. And in ""The Village"" there is a very ""cruise ship on shore"" feeling. The place is in a prime spot on the planet so they'll charge you a lot for anything you might need or want. Go off sight for tours, luaus or rentals of surf boards, umbrellas, snorkels and chairs. I mention Cons, but I truly believe how much those add up are completely up to you and your attitude towards life. If you complain at a resort in Hawaii, I assume you complain most everywhere. Prepare for people, prices and fees, but also take stock in where you are and who your with. The Grand Wiakikian was fun for all of us because we knew what we were signing up for. Do the same, make your plan and then kick back and enjoy the surf and sun and everything else will be painless ... Unless your mind creeps into the negative while you're waiting for the elevator.","Los Angeles, California","CleChiLa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",51,4.0

Here is a breakdown of our stay. Hope it helps you plan your vacation as other reviews have helped me.Rooms: We booked a 1 bd bath ocean view room 5 months in advance. From reading the reviews I was concerned that the ocean would not really be visible. However when we got to the room we were pleasantly surprised. The ocean view was amazing. You could see the turquoise waters of Waikiki beach, as well as the lagoon. It did make me nervous when my kids (9 and 4) were out on the balcony as we were so high up so you have to watch them carefully when they are out there, or make it out of limits. We could hear and see the Luau every night but I found it a plus more than a minus.The beds were OK. They were a bit small and soft. They are double beds not queen so it’s a bit tight for 2 adults.Housekeeping came everyday. It was so nice to come back after a day at the beach to a clean room. Make sure you leave some tips as they will provide extra towels, toiletries etc. We rented on movie so really didn’t take advantage of the free rentals and x-box. But it’s a great feature to have and probably only possible in a resort as big as HHV.Pools : We were mostly at the Paradise pool since the slides were there. We didn’t have much trouble finding chairs as most people have complained about. If you go early (before 10) there are plenty of chairs. If you go later, you just stand around and there are ppl leaving all the time so you will find a chair soon enough. The pool and slides are great. It is full of kids, and a couple of times there were “accidents” so the pool had to be closed for cleaning for several hours.Lagoon: This was a good place to go when the pool is closed or you get sick of the slides. We did the stand up paddle and it was much easier than expected and a lot of fun. Even my 9 year old could do it. It is a good place to swim although colder than the pool, and has a bit of a stench.Beach: The beach is beautiful, clean and calm outside the hotel. It is not very crowded since most of the ppl there are hotel guests. You could spend the day there just frolicking in the water. The water is calm enough for little kids to play in the shallows. However there are no lifeguards, so be aware.Location: Location was good as it was not in the middle of Waikiki, so not as crowded but you can walk to a lot of touristy places if you wanted to. Ala Moana mall is about 15 mins walk, or 5 min drive. The food court there is good for lunch. Roys is good for dinner. Parking. I did a lot of research on this and we ended up renting a car and paying the $27/day for parking. When I did the math for renting a car for a few days in Waikiki vs paying for a full week rental near the airport it was only $50 more for the rental +parking and we would have the added flexability. Renting a car from Waikiki is expensive ($80/day) and you need to factor in the cost of the cab rides to and from the airport. I would recommend renting the full week from Costco.Other/Activities. Fireworks on Friday night is fantastic. Lapperts ice cream is a must. Love the full resort feel and all the conveniences it offers. We stayed at quieter places with nicer rooms, and this resort although busy more than makes up for in terms of location and full array of activities.Recommend going to the Farmers market at Diamond Head on Saturday mornings.","San Francisco, California, United States","KateN285</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California, United States</strong>",17,5.0

You have restaurants, shops, several swimming pools, and right on Waikiki beach.We were in a two bedroom suite with a view into the lagoon. The suite was well decorated and gorgeous. The view can't be beat! The kitchen was small but more than adequate for preparing food. My only complain is the terrible knives that they keep in the suite. If you are trying to cut a pineapple, be prepared to work hard or bring your own knives. The location of this hotel is great. As many other reviewers point out, you can pretty much walk to any of the main tourist areas. Our first day, we took a 15 min walk to Hard Rock Cafe for drinks and to explore the area. A few days later, we just took a walk along Waikiki beach starting from the Grand Waikikian to the other end. The hotel is also a common stop for many of the tour buses so you don't have to go anywhere to get picked up. There is also plenty of parking in the garage although it is pretty pricey but that's typical for most places in Hawaii.It there is one negative, I would say that its popularity makes it pretty crowded. For example, the Starbucks is always packed. So are the restaurants there but I would just advise eating off the property.",San Diego,"SANsna</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",123,4.0

The resort amenities are fine, but not great. They have 3 pools, of which one is a ""Super Pool"" but there is really nothing super about it. The much smaller pool has a couple of slides for the kids, but the pool is very narrow and small so it gets packed very quickly. The grounds are beautiful and right on the beach so that is very appealing and the main reason we chose this location.With that said, what really was disappointed me the most was their customer service (or lack there of). We spoke with several people at the resort (Concierge, front desk, guest services, etc.) and there were 3 people that were very nice and helpful. Everyone else truly lacked any customer service skills. I have written a letter of complaint to the GM and the corporate offices because they were rude and unfriendly, which is not what you would expect at a resort of this caliber.

Hopefully this will warn people who potentially want to book packages through HGV. In November last year I paid for a 7 night ""VIP"" package for the GW Suites (2 bedroom apartment). This purchase was under the promise from sales staff that we would have absolutely no trouble booking the room in 2014. Coming from overseas, travel times are limited and I was assured and GUARANTEED there would be no problems at all. In January, I tried to book for April - no availability. So I decided to give more notice and attempted to book for October (6 months in advance) and was told the same. Apparently we had to stay in another hotel owned by Hilton, somewhere else in Waikiki. The sales reps were so rude and wouldn't respond to our calls and pretty much just said 'tough luck'. The rep who originally sold me the deal still has not responded to me 6 weeks later. We were told that the Tower was completely booked out, which was strange as the exact room I purchased was available on numerous accommodation sites as well as Hilton's own website. Scam?! The rudeness from the staff just kept continuing and I realised that they just don't care. Then came the fight to get a refund! In the end I enlisted the help of the Better Business Bureau to try an get the money back. The BBB were told I would get a refund in ""a few business days"" -- 3.5 weeks later a US check turned up. We cannot deposit a foreign check and it's going to take 8 weeks to clear AFTER we get charged a whole bunch of fees. So we are losing money! After more frustrated emails, HGV refuse to refund directly to the credit card we payed for this disaster on. I now cannot get MY money in time to book the planned holiday somewhere else in Waikiki. So bitterly disappointed in Hilton's staff, especially the ones at the Village who sold me a package that couldn't be used. Completely lost faith in the Hilton brand, which is a shame as the HHV used to be a favourite place to stay. I don't expect anything more than a generic template reply to this review... I just want to warn any travellers who are looking to purchase pre-paid packages to stay in the Grand Waikikian without secured dates. DON'T DO IT! For people staying at HHV (as I was) if you are approached to purchase such a deal, run away! No matter what they promise you, don't do it. It's not worth the trouble. Worst customer service ever.

THe room was very comfortable and spacious. We had an excellent ocean/lagoon/pool view between the Lagoon Tower and the building next door. We also had a spectacular city view from the bedroom balcony. The Friday night fireworks were spectacular and we had an excellent view from our front balcony. THe location of the Grand Waikikian in the HAwaiin village is much better for young families than Waikiki beach itself. WE loved the lagoon, and the equipment, like stand up paddle boards for hire. A little expensive, but a great experience.The turtles pond and the magnificent parrots were a hit with the kids and looked great in photos. It is very easy to access many different types of food, restaurants and takeaway. For lunch, I loved the California Sushi rolls by the Paradise pool. THere were many great choices for dinner. Starbucks in the resort is a bonus for that breakfast caffeine hit. THe only downsides occur because the resort is so large and can feel crowded in areas. Also inconsiderate people are in the habit of putting towels on all the poolside chairs early in the morning to bar them all day, whether they use them or not. At Disney Aulani resort staff remove unused towels after an hour...Overall ,a great, convenient choice for families.

Normally our visits to this property is overall satisfying, however, we were forced into accommodations - because of HGVC online booking feature failure - we never got to book the tower we prefer despite very early and repeated efforts even with customer support. It appears that HGVC might be oversold and thereby can no longer deliver on promises made to timeshare buyers/owners. Anyhow, because we had concrete plans, we ended up in a much smaller unit than our elite status purchases and were also immediately disappointed with the response when an article of clothing was reported to management as disappearing from the unit never again to be found; one of the toilets 'sang' when flushed through the entire stay; air-conditioning did not control temperature uniformly throughout the unit; main bedroom was too stuffy as a window couldn't even be cracked a little and even with the bedroom door wide open all night; garbage was not picked up in a timely manner and needed to be left out in the hallway overnight; etc... Overall, a big disappointment on what was to have been a pleasant graduation surprise outing for our eldest daughter. HGVC needs to either fix their online booking system or else stop not allowing HGVC members to book select properties as might be occurring (meaning once you stay at a 'prime' location you cannot go back). At least that is what it seemed like despite our valient efforts to secure the property we had wanted. In the past year we have stayed at HGVC Miami South Beach (A+); the Hilton Hotel in the Florida Keys (B+) and HGVC waikola (Big Island) (A+) and, as elite members, believe our expectations are not unrealistic.

PROS: It is very clean and quite beautiful. They have fireworks on Friday which were actually pretty good. They even show movies at night outside as well one or two nights per week. The resort is really it's own city - there is shopping, restaurants, ice cream ect,. and if you are really lucky they may even be filming Hawaii 5-0 while you were there! They have their own dedicated parking spots and rooms at the Grand Waikikian. The beds and rooms are comfortable, there is a Starbucks on the property - there is also a small little beach lagoon as well (that's where the fireworks are set off from) The staff is friendly and helpful. If you want to stay at a hotel and not really have to leave this would be great for you - there is a lot to do just on the grounds (but be prepared to $$) CONS: Pools - yes there are 4 or 5 but none of the pools have sun at the same time -you have to rotate pools with the sun which is hard since everyone else is also doing the same thing - and there is a lot of chair hoarding due to that fact. towels for the pool and rooms need to be replaced - as well as the lounge chairs at the pool as well. You want to go the beach? - It will cost you $15 for an umbrella and $10 for 2 chairs DAILY to layout on the beach???? UMM doesn't the resort fee cover that? Guess not, and Parking - another $35/day -- we rent a car wherever we go - we like to explore. I just think with a resort fee of 25/day there should not be a charge for beach chairs/umbrellas - parking I can understand since it's pricey all over the island - but to be charged for both is excessive. Since the place is so big - be prepared to walk and walk - 10 min from our room to the restaurant/bar area - but hey you are on vacation walk off some of the drinks/food!Would I stay here again.... I am 50/50 on that - one point I know what I am getting myself into with the fees and costs AND I also know that I am getting a clean and maintained resort as well - so do the pros beat out the cons, probably so. My most important thing is how clean and comfortable the rooms and hotel grounds are. I know you don't spend a lot of time in the room, but I like to start my day feeling relaxed and I can only do that in nice rooms. I am a hotel snob will freely admit that.

This was my first trip to Hawaii. I stayed in a 2 double bed partial ocean view room. I stayed for 8 nights. I am NOT a HGVC member. Upon arrival there were no problems the staff was very accommodating and assisted me with my luggage. They also gave me information about the pools and various excursions at the resort. This is a big busy resort, I was totally aware of this going in. However I was surprised it was actually not that busy. This is not a secluded Maui resort, you should not be expecting that. As I said it is busy but not ridiculously busy. The hotel facilities were very nice. See my Hilton Hawaiian Village review for a review of the facilities. My room was on the 28th floor with an amazing view of the city and an OK view of the ocean. I come from a small town, so the view was just that much more amazing. The view of city and the mountains is amazing anytime of the day even at night. The room was large. The bathroom was small and the shower head was broken but worked fine. The internet was fast. The TV and the PS3 with DVD rentals were an added plus. The beds were great as well as the couch. The furnished balcony had amazing views and was a very good size. I think the best part of the room had to be a washer and dryer. This was extremely useful especially because most of my trip it was extremely humid. The staff is very nice. I would not say they would go out of their way to assist with 5 star service, but then again this is a resort not a five star hotel. On my day of arrival I left my luggage on the shuttle the staff was very helpful in assisting me to get it back. On the day of my departure the lounge was very nice. It has lockers so you can store your items, and showers to refresh before your flight. The lounge also has cold water and internet access. Overall my stay was amazing. The only reason I do not rate this as 5 stars is because it is not a 5 star hotel and I think it is better that way. I am very picky when it comes to my hotels. Overall very pleased.

We had a great experience 4 years ago and decided that the apartment style complex would suit us and our two children.Having booked 6+ months prior for this visit, I was surprised to not be able to book a 2br apartment for us and our two young children. I went ahead and booked a one bedroom with a very specific request that we not be directly opposite the luau which is held on top of the car park next door. Of most important to us was that there a view of the beach given the amount of time that we spend in the room. We were extremely disappointed that there was only a glimpse of water and just the boat masts on the harbour when you craned your head from the balcony. With two small children, we spent a lot of time in the room and it was very disappointing as a part of a beach holiday to be overlooking a main road and buildings when I had specifically requested and booked a beach view. I spoke with the reception about this who offered no solution. I then requested to speak with the manager. Late that afternoon we were shown the only alternative available which was what smelt like a smoking room on level 7 directly opposite from where the luau is held which was clearly not going to be suitable.All in all, I like the hilton facility, the location, the staff, the room service, the pools and one of the restaurants (Tropics) but I'm not sure that we will stay there again next time given the room we were provided with in this trip.","Sydney, Australia","We_love_holidays_107</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",76,3.0

We arrived around 1:30 and were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready. Check in staff were very pleasant and delighted my kids with welcome leis as well as an escort to the owners lounge – just in case we needed it as we were leaving. They also introduced us to the concierge who gave us a welcome beach bag, a great map of the resort, and offered to help us book activities if needed. There was no pressure at all. We’re advance planners so we didn’t need anything but food recommendations.When we booked we had our choice of the Waikikian or the Lagoon Tower. We chose the Waikikian because of the washer/dryer and the updated décor. We did use the washer/dryer almost every day. It was especially nice to be able to dry swimsuits. We used the refrigerator and microwave to prepare restaurant leftovers and to have cereal in the morning, but did not do any heavy duty cooking. There are too many good restaurants in the vicinity and we were on vacation! We were traveling with our 6 and 9 year old children who loved going to Benihana and would have gladly had dinner there every night. It’s expensive, but provided one of the trip highlights for my kids. Another good option for food is the Wailani Coffee House (great and inexpensive breakfast) just across the street from HHV. Round Table Pizza also provided a good in-room respite after a long day at the beach. We also loved going to Starbucks for their boxed food (protein packs, fruit and cheese tray, etc.), and taking it to the beach with Frappuccinos. We did not care for Pronto Pickle – the HHV quick food to go service. As for activities, we spent one day at Pearl Harbor (book in advance directly to avoid crazy tour fees!), one day at the Polynesian Cultural Center (highly recommended), and the rest of our week mostly lounging at the beach and pools. Our on-site activities included the Atlantis submarine trip. My kids loved it! My 9 year old did a surf lesson through the resort. The instructors took great care of him on the water. They have a photographer on the water as well to get action shots. They were so great I bought a flash drive with all the photos for $60, which I consider money well spent to keep me out of the deep water! We also did a hula lesson and a ukulele lesson which were very much enjoyed. My kids also really enjoyed the penguins. You can sit on the wall/enclosure and just chill with them for as long as you want while they swim and play. We played at the Paradise Pool for the water slides, but always migrated back to the beach. It’s a lot less crowded, the water is warm, and the sand is so nice on the feet. HHV uses a card system for towels. When we checked in they asked how many cards we would like. We got two per person. You trade the cards in for fresh towels and can trade the towels back for cards. You pay $10 if you lose a card/towel. It was really nice being able to get fresh towels when ours got too wet or caked in sand.The room is equipped with two televisions and a Playstation. Each tower has a bank of DVD Now machines that offer games and movies at no charge (one at a time). My son loved the ability to rent various games to try, with the option of just taking it back if he didn’t like it. We also rented a movie.There is a mall just down the street as well – probably a mile. We walked it easily. It’s an odd mix of very high end (Prada, Dior, Chanel, etc.) and Long’s Drugs, Foodland, etc. Nonetheless it provided a great distraction for our exit day. We had to leave the room by 10am but our flight didn’t leave until 3pm. We stored our luggage with the bell captain and went to the mall for a bit of souvenir shopping and a nice lunch. My only complaint for the week would be the blankets on the bed/sofabed, which were scratchy. Tips: • Charley’s Taxi has a flat rate to/from the airport for $29. No coupon required – just ask for it.• Bring your own laundry soap and dryer sheets to avoid high prices and unfamiliar brands/scents","San Diego, California","Savarra</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",25,5.0

Upon arrival everything was the way it should be, professional check in, professional baggage handling, etc. First impressions for looks were very good. We did not have an ocean view but city view which was kind of a nice change as we would be on the beach all day. One surprise is how busy the traffic is on the main road next to the hotel. The traffic in the entire city is as bad as I have seen. You will hear sirens and loud exhaust systems with the patio doors closed but it's not bad. I liked the city and mountain views at night. This is an enormous complex with several hotel buildings and a mini shop and restaurant area in the middle which was also a nice surprise. We shopped and ate at several of them, (Frescos, Tropics, one of the Japanese places, the pizza place and the ice cream place). I also liked the several ABC stores on site for snacks. We laid out by two of the pools and one day on the beach and rented an umbrella and beach lounge chairs, all placed for us by staff. (By the way for you cheap skates, tip these guys, as I saw many people not tip them after they lugged these items out to the beach and set them up for you). I also tried paddle boarding in the lagoon which was really fun. There is a car rental place on the premises and we rented a car for the day and drove the north shore, only 75 dollars. Don't waste money on the Atlantis sub ride, you don't see much. There was a huge party and band on Friday night in the common area which we could have attended but did not, it looked fun though. I have seen many posts about this being a ""Japanese tailored property"". I have to disagree. While there was a large contingent of Japanese tourists and staff to assist them, there are as many non Japanese staff and people staying as well. Frankly I liked it as it made the hotel an international experience for us. The room was a suite with a fold out couch and full kitchen which we stocked with items from the ABC store. Huge bathroom, jacuzzi tub, and large patio and sitting area. Nice flat screens, and comfy furniture. We did run out of toilet paper and towels and I talked to a worker in the hallway who promptly brought us what we needed. Our next trip to Hawaii I don't think we would go to Waikiki or Oahu island as Maui was much more of the Hawaiian experience we were looking for, but if I had to go to Honolulu again, I would stay here no problem. Lots of pluses here, no real negatives, maybe the sheer size of the complex, but do your research first if this is a problem for you.

I chose this location over the other two Honolulu locations based on price and Trip Advisor ratings.This hotel is nice, but so are most other hotels in Honolulu. I was disappointed in the room and the view, especially after recently staying at the Elara in Vegas. The view from this 21st floor hotel was an unimpressive city view. I requested a high floor beach view, but I guess the are less willing to accommodate if you have prepaid for the room. Self parking was $27 a day and you had to drive to least the 3rd level of the deck unless you wanted to valet park, which was $33 a day. I hate valet parking, because you have to pay more to wait for your car. No big deal. The room was nice, but sort of bland for a beach room in Honolulu. It was clean when we entered the room, but they only service the room one time in a week unless you pay for more service. All the pillows are very thin, which is so unlike any other Hilton worldwide I've stayed in. I was able to eventually get service to bring me another one, but the guy stood there like he was wanting a tip. Why should I have to tip for a decent pillow? They would bring up towels quickly if you called down and requested it. I had a hard time getting toilet paper, so I finally went to the second floor and procured some off a cleaning cart. I'm not sure why they can't just stock extra in the room like other Hilton properties do. They have a decent kitchen with an empty fridge. Bring your own skillet or buy one, because theirs is terrible. For some reason I had to attend a sales pitch for the property, although I had already paid for the room. It was in the middle of the day, which ruined our day. I tried to get them to reschedule to another time for us, but they said they couldn't. We attended with an open mind anyway. My goal was to be very friendly and actively listen to their pitch, but ""Lance"" quickly changed my attitude. ""Lance"" didn't like when I mentioned that I wished I could have changed the time of our meeting. He rudely said they were too busy for that and that I should just be glad I got a good deal on the room. I told him that I paid almost $300 a night 8 months ago, which wasn't that a great of a deal after I researched that hotel and others. He got furious and exclaimed I was staying in a $1,200.00 a night room. I was shocked that he thought I was an idiot. I told him that I could have gotten this room for around $320 online. He told me I was wrong. I said I guess my computer was lying. He said it sure was. I then told him he needed to treat me better than that, because I did have a little sense. I have an MBA and am very well-traveled staying in many hotels, including some in Honolulu. He said he didn't care and then asked me if I planned on wasting his time or if I was buying. I told him not with the way he was treating me. He then walked out of the room and then came back to tell us that we were free to go, while he escorted us to the door. I then proceeded to give him a tip to help him, because I work with consumers daily. I told him he would be more effective if the treated people nicer instead of like third-graders. He didn't seem to care. I can't believe Hilton lets their salesmen treat potential customers like crap. What a way to lose a potential customer. This hotel was just okay for me.

The Rainbow Tower blocked most of them. 2) AC was great in the living room and the second bedroom, but pretty wimpy in the master bedroom.Room was clean and plenty spacious for the five of us.

I told him that we already own property elsewhere and we weren't interested. He accepted this and it wasn't mentioned again.Our 2 bedroom room was wonderful it was very clean and comfortable for 2 adults and 2 teenage girls. We wanted a room this size as teenagers need their own space as we were staying 12 nights. It had a partial ocean view which was very nice indeed. The house keeping was also exceptional except they don't like to leave toilet paper and we had to keep asking for this. They would immediately send up as many rolls as we required. The only down fall would be that their beds need upgrading. I found them to be very uncomfortable, not bad enough to say I had a bad night sleep but I like the Hilton sleep serenity beds and having stayed in many Hilton hotels this is what I expect to sleep on. If they upgrade there beds (and they should as they are getting old) this would have been a perfect room. Having a washer and dryer in the room is a BIG BONUS as this is something that I now look for when booking a room.Our room was right next to the elevators and many people say that they can hear the elevators and ask for a room away from them. Well up until now I have never stayed near the elevators and I have to agree. From now on when I book a hotel room I will DEFIANTLY be asking not to be near the elevators. It really is annoying and I couldn't work out what this noise was that was keeping me awake, it was the elevators and YES they go all night. This is nothing against the Hotel as it would be the same where ever you stay. I guess it only takes one experience to realize this.The HHV it self is FABULOUS very glad we stayed there but it could have been closer to the center of Waikiki. It is only about a 10 minute walk to Ala Moana which is good but like a 30 minute walk to Waikiki. It really is to far to just pop down to Waikiki for tea so plan to be there in the afternoon and hang around for tea. Recommend the Cheesecake factory before 6pm. We went there at about 5:30pm and had to wait till 6pm to be seated but we expected this and planed it that way. You can have up to a 2 hr wait at times. The restaurants in the village are great as well, we ate at the New York Deli 3 times including breakfast, Roundtable pizza, the Italian restaurant and the Japanese Steakhouse. All was wonderful. You don't have to leave the village it is a holiday destination in itself.As a well rounded traveler I would defiantly recommend the Grand Waikikian at the Hilton Hawaiian Village my family and I loved it.

I was very nervous prior to our travel as I had booked direct through Hilton Vacation Ownership and we had to do a timeshare presentation. I must admit I was checking trip advisor regularly to see if I could get a good understanding of the hotel. I was scared at some points with peoples reviews of the properties but just kept thinking that was their opinion only. We arrived at the hotel at 9am to a lovely and hospitable welcome. Our room was not ready (which we had expected), so they let us shower and refresh on Level 8, which was just what we needed. So we hit the streets for breakfast with our buzzer in our hands waiting for our room. We got a beep at 1pm and we were in our room absolutely thrilled at what we had been given. I could finally relax.. it truly was fantastic and exceeded all my expectations. Dennis our personal concierge had already left a lovely message for us and we felt like all was going to be great... which it was.The 2 Bedroom Apartment was fantastic and spacious. I have 2 boys with food allergies, so the kitchen was my best friend. It was well equipped with pots and pans. We had enough crockery and glasses for 6 people which was enough for us. In Bedroom 2 we had 2 double beds which was great and a king in the Master Room. Make sure you get above 7th floor if you are staying on the resort side as you do not want to be looking at the car park. I would have been so upset with that view, especially after travelling 11 hours from Australia. The pool area is fantastic but very busy. My only complaint is that people would leave their towel on seats and leave the hotel. I had a couple do it in front of us. They left the grounds with their towels on the seats, then came back over an hour later. This is so not fair as you want to watch your children whilst they are playing in the pool. This might be something for the hotel to look into. (Very hard to control though). I said to my husband that the pool with the slides lacked poolside service. But on our last 3 days this became available with a cafe opening up. Fantastic to sit with a cocktail by the pool.We did many tours, which were fantastic. The only downside to this is that we had to walk all the way to the tour desk on the other side of Hilton Hawaiian Village to get collected. At 6.30 or 7.45 in the morning and 2 kids this was a bit of a task. They should be able to collect you from Grand Waikikian entrance, It would make it a bit easier.The location is a bit further out from Kalakahua Ave but it is an easy 15 min walk. If you want to be in the middle of it all then maybe this is not for you. We were happy with the location as it was a 10 minute beachside walk to Trump on Kalia RD, and a 10 minute walk in the other direction to Ala Moana Shopping Centre. We ended up buying a 7 day Waikiki Trolley pass that came in handy when my little boy was too tired to walk back. It was time to do the Timeshare presentation. Coming from Australia we really didn't know much about it, but we were interested to find out. We did not feel at all under any pressure to buy. Melissa our agent was lovely and then we met Ron which was great. I just wish we had more information before we attended as we were not going to commit to a $30,000 purchase until I spoke to my accountant. I would have liked more information to bring home with me so I could investigate this option for us more closely. We were offered a deal to come back and stay by 2015, but didn't take it up at the time as i felt like information overload. I like to contemplate things before I jump in and buy. We decided to take up this offer as it would allow us to investigate time share more closely at Hilton. To this day I am still waiting on a response from phone calls, messages left prior to leaving Grand Waikikian,nand emails re this offer, which is pretty disappointing.In Conclusion, we had the most amazing time on our holiday and it would have not been as memorable if it wasn't for the care to detail and patience of Linda Bade. She made our Hawaii trip so successful and we are now organising our next one. You will love your stay at Grand Waikikian.

The Lagoon tower has better ocean views. You can not hear the annoying nightly luau from the GW , so that is a plus ! There is no direct way in to this building, you seem to have to walk around or thru the Lagoon tower lobby. There should be an entrance closer to the front of the property.

They re-did the TAPA pool , I don't like it as much. It used to be more secluded now people can get in from both ends of the pool ( it used to be only open at the bar end ) so it is busier. The beds in the one bedroom are kind of small for two people, I am guessing the are queen, king would have made a big difference.

We were offered 7 days plus car rental at Dollar and an upgrade from a 1 BR/ 1 bath to a 2 BR/ 2 bath suite (we paid for the upgrade)About us, we are well travelled in the US and abroad, middle class in late 40's of age. The experience;1) Dollar Car Rental is off site from the airport and is on the low end of car rental but free is free. The car wasn't clean and wasn't the best but again, it was free. 2) Upon arrival we were registered within 10 min and given a Hawaiian leis. My fiancé asked if we could have a room with an ocean view and was told it was a ""city view"" lol. OK, we had to try. We were taken to the 15th floor and upon entering found that it did indeed have an ocean view and overlooked parking and the luau as well (faced the Rainbow Hilton). We were pleased with the view. The room was a generous in size, fully equipped and even had a washer and dryer. Everything was clean and problem free. Our weeks stay was overall very satisfying. The property was clean ( they even buff the sidewalks) with plenty of shops, resturaunts and pools though I wish one pool was dedicated to adults only. The property was definitely kid/ family friendly and one evening we noted a childs movie being played on the lawn. The staff were friendly, and helpful including the valet, concierge and bellman. We had such a nice stay that my fiancé who was already a Hilton Diamond decided to buy into the time share. The salesperson was extremely nice, helpful and ultimately was instrumental in her deciding to make the purchase. Now the critical part;1) Upon registration, it would have seemed that the girl helping us should have known which side our room was facing. Surprised us upon seeing the ocean and a big plus but still she should have known. 2) Checkin was 4 pm and they stick to it no matter how early you get there. However, they do give you access to a nice lounge that has showers. 3) The worst problem and ALMOST a deal breaker was in the last hour of our stay. In signing the deal for the timeshare we were going to run past our checkout time and the salesman called the front desk and told them our checkout could be 1pm instead of the customary late 12 noon. At 12:20 a lady called stating we hadn't checked out yet and was charging $150 to her card. When my fiancé told her we had an email stating 1 pm and what had happened, she continued to state she was charging her $150. After asking for the manager, it was resolved and we checked out at 1 pm. We wanted to talk to a manager face to face but was told they were all out to lunch but one would call us before leaving the island in 3 hours. 3 days later, we are still waiting.

Not so! As luck would have it, we managed to squeeze three nights in the Penthouse again this year. It did not disappoint. To clarify, the penthouse suites at the Grand Waikikian are not your standard HGVC Penthouse suites. It comes with private Penthouse concierge service, daily cleaning service and evening turndown service, Penthouse lounge, complimentary continental breakfast, and cocktail/ pupu hour nightly including complimentary beer/wine. Penthouse suites are floors 35 and up. Theses cost a ridiculous amount of points (but are totally worth it). This year we got a two bedroom penthouse (ph) suite - room 3511. This suite was truly amazing. Being on the end of the building, it encompassed the entire side of the building, and offered three balconies each with its own view on a different side of the building. So we had a diamond head view (lots of ocean), a city view/ ocean view, and a full city view. Unreal!! The suite was beautifully decorated, well appointed and in good shape. Two balconies were average size and one was quite long. The views were gorgeous. Both bedrooms had bathrooms with jacuzzi tubs under the windows that allowed you to relax in the tub while enjoying the beautiful city lights at night. The second bedroom's shower was quite large and had a seat in the shower. Both bedrooms had their own balconies. The layout was not as open as the standard two-bedroom floor plan because of its end location, but given those views, there was no reason to complain. The suite is also on the same floor as the Penthouse lounge, which was very convenient. That meant we also had convenient access to the concierge staff just down the hall. There was no increased noise associated with being near the lounge. What really makes having a penthouse suite worthwhile is actually, in our opinion, the amazing Penthouse staff. We were really thrilled to see no turnover in the concierge staff from last year. Each one of them is remarkable in their own way. They are on top of everything, knowledgeable, multi-lingual, and just plain pleasant. We just love each one of them. From managing room switches, to making a dinner reservation, to making recommendations for what not to miss on your day's plans, to just smoothing out some little wrinkle, they can be counted on 100%. They remember everything. It's great walking in to the lounge for breakfast and being greeted by ""so how was dinner at Tiki's last night? Did you try the ribs?"". They just never miss a beat. I am not exaggerating when I say these people make the trip go from great to spectacular!! Penthouse was all we remembered it to be. Great suites, amazing views, and truly wonderful staff. I know we won't catch all of you (and we do mean to....not one of you fails to amaze us) and I will likely butcher some spelling but ... Thanks Keiko, Mayumi, Hiromi, David, Darlene and Stanley!

They did not allow us to get to our room until 3:30 PM. But they gave us access to a Lounge, which it was very basic compared to others I have been. The staff was very professional and eventhough they offer timeshare acquisitions, they were not pushy nor irritating. There are many dining options but it is better to call and make sure you can walk in. Many restaurants at walkable distance as well as cafe shops. There are small stores called ABC that sell absolutely everything and that's were I found healthy snack to take to my kids on the beach. Believe it or not there is a dairy queen as part of the complex as well. There was a breakfast buffet in one of the cafes close to the beach but only some days of the week.

But there is so much to see in Oahu that we also visited other areas in the island - Hanauma Bay, Makapuu lighthouse trail, Pearl Harbor and off course Waiola Snow Cones !

Last year we did the time share presentation in Orlando and purchased this trip at a discount. Well worth it! Not sure how it happened, but we were upgraded to a Pent House! (24 floor) ( I called about 3 weeks ahead of time and requested a ocean view room, per another person's reccomendation on tripadvisor... thanks to that person for the great idea). We were in the Lagoon Tower ( I don't think I was ever able to keep straight what each tower was and what it had until about the last day, the Lagoon tower and the Grand Waikikian are the vacation club towers). We didn't do the time share presentation until are 2nd to last day. The sales man was crazy, literally, I thought he had a mental illness. He spent more time telling us about his fancy sports car and how he missed his family in NY than anything. I don't even know the details of what he was offering. But that was fine, since we were not that interested in purchasing at this time. But we met another couple that purchases a once every other year package (so if you are interested ask about this.. our guy never mentioned it). Anyways back to the actual resort SO GREAT!! Our room was amazing. It was Lagoon Tower, room 2468. This was not close to the elevator (popular complaint after reading other reviews). We had a two story condo/suite. Upstairs had a Master Bedroom with a view of the Ocean/ Marina. Great closet and full bathrom. The 2nd bedroom had 2 twin beds, huge flat screen and another full bathroom,more than my 2 kids ever needed (they are a little spoiled now by the Pent House). The free nightly DVD rentals were awesome. We were able to rent one out of each machine each day. This was great for my kids. They rented games for the game station. Plus they watched movies ( which seems like a crazy thing to do on vacation, but a great way to entertain the kids while making dinner or getting ready for the day). We had a full living room. Another 1/2 bath on the main level. Great dining room table for 4 people. Full kitchen. The maid service provided dish washer soap ( we had to sneak out a 2nd packet from one of the maid carts for another day).There are free washer and dryers on each level, again each room had a packet of laundry soap. We were able to do laundry late at night and early in the morning with no difficulty. The kitchen was stocked with plates, silver ware, cups, coffee machine ( 2 packes of regular and decaf also included), toaster, rice maker and blender. Microwave, full stove and refrid.. I would highly rec'd going to Costco and picking up a few items to be able to eat in the condo if only for conveince, but mainly to save money ( we spent $80 one night on 2 pasta dishes and a small pizza, we went to costco and spent $25 on a whole baked chicken, vegtable tray, sweet rolls and raspberries). So the room was great! Maid service only comes on your third day. Excellent cleaning. The sundry store in the Lagoon tower had good prices comparatively, to the ABC store. The only place we could find cheap grapes and mac and cheese. The RESOT was excellent. The pools are great. My kids got to pet the penguins. The flamingoes are no longer there ( they are back at the zoo). We did the 9am hula lessons ( you need to sign up on your first day, because the classes are free, but fill up quickly). We did NOT do the Hilton Luau, we went to the Polynesian Cultural center and it was well worth the drive. Same price as the Hilton, but we go SO much more. One thing I was trying to find in the reviews was info about the Pools. Kids need to be 36 inches to be able to go down the water slide ( my kids are 38 and 41 but they needed to have a life jacket or water wings). Only one person can go down at a time. There are three slides, One is a short 5 foot slide, any age could do it. The Medium one was fast, my son was afraid at first, but then was going down like a pro. The ""big"" slide is mostly a tunnel and my husband said it was much faster than he imagined. My kids only did this one a few times. Other reveiws indicated how croweded every pool was, but it wasn't really a problem. I think we got at least 2 chairs everytime we went to the pool ( and I kids never got out of the pool to sit).

We had to call guest services OVER and OVER to request towels and TP. The number would ring and ring and the an automated service would pick up and some times place the call on a long hold or just hang up on us. Persistence eventually paid off but we had to be very persistent. We requested ice the night we checked in and waited 1.5 hours and called twice before it was delivered. The dishes and glass sets are incomplete. I suspect that when someone breaks one it is not replaced. One small frying pan nod one small and one medium pot made up the cookware. Really kind of pathetic considering the cost of the time share.Love the location. Love the grounds. Love the bed sheets. This was our fifth year in a row staying at Hilton properties in Hawaii. We will be back but compared to Kingsland on the big island or even our stay last year, the property has declined. As my daughter said that the customer service should have been outstanding for a hotel guest let alone a time share owner, but unfortunately it was not the case. We tried calling the concierge on Tuesday from 4:00 to 5:30 and no one ever answered. At check out we were not asked how our stay was....We will be back and hope that the customer service improves to what we expect from a Hilton property.",,Ayeessa,12,4.0

The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, pots, pans, etc. As an owner, the HGVC only provides mid-week cleaning. However, anytime I called for towels or supplies they were delivered within 10 minutes. The staff members around the resort were all very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the lagoon and the pool (both had sun and shade). The beach area was a bit crowded and the chair rental was expensive. However, our kids had a blast with the paddle boards in the lagoon.We ate at Tropics our first night at the resort and it was OK. We really enjoyed the Round Table pizza, Pronto Pickle and Starbucks. My kids also thought the ice cream shop was fantastic too. We prepared all of our breakfasts in the room and ate lunch by the pool a few days. We walked out into town for most of our dinners.Our car service from the airport stopped at Foodland for groceries and then we made a mid-week grocery stop at Safeway. However, we also purchased some groceries in the hotel store and the ABC store. We did not find the prices too outrageous. (Hawaii is still less expensive than the Bahamas.)Cab fare around town was relatively reasonable. We only rented a car for one day to make a trip to the North Shore.Here are a list of activities that we did: Nau Wale No Island Tour (Lighthouse hike, Blow Hole, North Shore, Turtles, Pali look out, etc.) Waimea Falls, Paradise Cove Luau, Island Magic Catamaran Snorkel, Dole Plantation & Hole-In-the-Wall Food Tour.

Location seems good; Don't have anything to compare with but it worked for us. Not so good stuff; Check-in: Lady at lobby who was handing out leis looked tired and uninterested. Offered leis to a party arrived before us but ignored us for most part as we walked in - even ignored our little one who went and stood in front of her trying to get her attention to get a lei. Half way through our check in process another member finally warmly welcomed and offered leis.The room: Kitchen: Roaches in the room. Found 2 roaches on the kitchen counter during our stay on 2 separate occasions. Not cool at all. We did not bother calling anyone because it was something that needed to be taken care of right away so got rid of them by ourselves. We did provide this input to the team member who was giving us the timeshare presentation and he offered to share this with the team. Never heard back before we left. If we decide to never come back to this property this would be one huge factor.Dated and stained/rusted silverware; Super scratched and smudgy glasses. Was missing can opener which was delivered when we called. No salt/pepper. I have stayed at various places with kitchens and always found salt and pepper in the kitchens but this one didn't have it.Kitchen needs to be better equipped (more pans)Bath and Bed linens: Not enough towels provided. Only 1 set of personal sized bath items. When housekeeping is only once in 4 days then I would think there should be more towels etc provided so you don't have to ask for more after every shower. Same thing with the dishwasher soap and the laundry detergent. Got more in reasonable time when asked for. Housekeeping only once in 4 days. When they cleaned our room they did not change fitted sheet for the pull out sofa. We ended up washing it ourselves.Rest of the Resort: Food: Didn't eat much at the resort: Round table pizza not good at all. Tried to get into the Tropics Friday evening there was a huge wait so passed. Tapa bar had a 30 min turnaround time for drinks (only drinks - no food was ordered). Breakfast buffet at the Lagoon tower was disappointing - very dry hash browns; ran out of white bread; oatmeal container was empty when we got there. Made to order Omelets were good. Expensive.Pools: Crowded but ok. It can get hard to get chairs. Couples making out in the pool in full view of young kids was embarrassing. We had to leave the pool to avoid that behavior. Cigarette smoke from the beach area can be heavily smelled in the pool area - again not something that worked for us.

I will however try to give a review of the Grand Waikikian which is where we stayed for a week of our visit to Hawaii. We didn't ask for any specific requests but found ourselves on the 27th floor overlooking the city and the mountains. As much as I would have liked the ocean view, I had no illusions that I would get one. I was however pleasently surprised to be on such a high floor. There's about 36 floors in this building. The ones above me were the Penthouse and sales floors. So we were pretty high up. The speed at which we moved up and down in the elevator was impressive. We never had to wait too long for an elevator and in such a large building, that's saying something. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite. The interesting thing is we were on the end of the building and the balcony (lanai) was as long as the room. In other words, the balcony was accessable from the bedroom and living room. The balconies on the end of the building were longer than the balconies on the side of the building. You will see that in the pictures I post to this review. The view was really very nice even if it wasn't the ocean view. The room was very nice. If you have ever stayed at Parc Soleil the rooms are similar but a little smaller than at Parc Soleil. Lighing in the room was very good. Even in the bathroom. There was only one sink in this room. I don't know if this is true for all one-bedrooms in this building, but was true for this one. For some reason, I couldn't adjust the AC. Since we visited Hawaii at the end of the rainy season, we had a couple of days of rain as well as a little cooler temperatures. The AC was set to 70 degrees but when we tried to raise it, it wouldn't change. So we had to adjust the AC by turning it off and on. I confess I did not report this but I'm sure if I had, someone would have come to fix it. The kitchen is well equiped with everything you might need for four people. It is a regular full size kitchen with full size refrigerator with ice maker, stove, microwave and dishwasher. The living room area had a nice flat screen TV with a PS3 attached. The PS3 had the capability of running Blue Ray DVDs. Interestingly, there is a DVD service for both the Lagoon Tower and the Grand Waikikian that offers free DVD rentals. Actually you can get as many DVDs as you want while you are there. You just have to get one DVD at a time. You have to replace one DVD before getting another. Our only problem was we could never find a DVD that worked successfully. We got a BR DVD of a movie from the Lagoon Tower (since we stayed there first) but had trouble with skipping and locking up. We put the DVD back and got the same movie from the Grand Waikikian and had the same problem. We reported this to the front desk and they had the PS3 replaced. So we tried again and had the same issue. So I'm not too impressed with the quality of the DVDs in these kiosks. In theory, this is a nice amenity, but for us, it was rather frustrating since we couldn't watch a movie without problems. Other than these minor issues, we were very happy with our stay in this room. A couple of other tips and information. Parking is expensive. Overnight parking costs $27 but offers in and out access. Since we didn't want to pay that amount everynight for the week, we only had a car for a couple of days. The Hertz rental desk is opened from 6am to 1pm daily. However if you want to return a car outside of these hours, you can drop off your keys and contract on the 5th floor of the parking garage. If you don't get a parking pass the hourly cost is $8 per hour. So if you decide to have a car for one day and want to use the parking garage, it could get expensive if you keep the car in the garage for very long. If you plan to rent a car for several days, you will need to go to the front desk to get a pass card for the garage. Then you will be charged the $27 per day that you are in the garage. A little known alternative is that there is parking at the marina next to the property. However, that parking expires at 10pm in the evening. There is a section called ""Lot A"" that costs $6 per hour. But something that is not well known is that there is free parking on the marina as well. The sign indicates that the parking is for beach and boating access. If you only plan to be a short period of time, like an hour or so, you might be able to park here for free. However, it is a popular place to park so it might be hard to find a spot. It's a convenience that I would not take advantage off for too long. I don't know if you could get towed if you weren't actually going to be beach. But who knows. It's a kind of a walk from that parking to the HHV buildings. There is plenty of transportation available to get around Honolulu and Waikiki. There are trolley shuttles that are $2 per person per direction. However, if it is raining, you could get wet even on the trolleys since it is open to the weather. If you're up to it, the Ala Moana Mall is 3 tenths of a mile from HHV. If you're young and ambitious, you can actually walk just about anywhere in the Waikiki area. Or you could take the trolley in one direction and walk back. Just an additional bit of information. I know it is expensive to eat in Hawaii. It is also expensive to eat at the HHV. If you are a breakfast person, some of the locations within HHV can cost as much as $20 for a buffet breakfast. We like going to the Wailana Coffee House for breakfast. They have an all you can eat pancake breakfast with coffee for about $8.95 or without coffee so you can order your own drink, for $6.95. They are right outside of the HHV property so they are close. There is so much more, but I need to stop. I love Hawaii and HHV is where I stay when going to Oahu.",South Carolina,"gwlane</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Carolina</strong>",21,5.0

The rate was cheap, the process was easy, and the trip was awesome. There are stands by the beach to rent a jet-ski, surf board, paddle board, go snorkeling(which I recommend), rent a segway(which was a blast), and just about anything else.

We were able to buy fruit and have lovely fruit salad for breakfast, also a toaster is available, so toast with cheese and we had a great little breakfast . (A rice cooker available as well :o)). The living room had a extremely comfortable little couch - usually hotels have lumpy hard couches, not this one. Also a DVD player and a game console were available - DVD's can be rented in the lobby. The bed and pillows were very comfortable - slept very well. All in all I really loved this place, was nice coming ""home"" at the end of the day and chilling!

We explored almost all of Oahu using The Bus and a car that we rented for 4 days (and parked in the public lot by the marina), and we discovered that the walk down into the main Waikiki area or to Ala Moana Shopping Center was easy and excellent way to burn off some of those calories we were consuming. We loved shopping in the ubiquitous ABC Stores, and we were rewarded with some free gifts for saving our receipts. The beach in front of the complex is one of the widest and nicest along ALL of Waikiki, and we never had a problem finding a place for our towel there. We had a small issue with our dryer door falling off! that was quickly and efficiently resolved by one of the nicest maintenance people I have ever encountered.

While the vacation itself was nice, I figure it is about time that I listed my long standing grievances with this Hilton property.The one constant detraction from this resort and my experience at Grand Waikian is the checking in and room assignment. Like most people, we had requested that where possible, we be put on a higher floor. We understand that this request cannot be accomodated all the times but asking for a higher floor at the Grand Waikikian is like dental surgery.First of all, it was clear that the Hilton staff had absolutely no intention of even trying to accomodate this request. I received a brief nod and after various clicks on the keyboard, the Hilton staff provided me with a room key and tried to send me on my way. The fact that she made no mention of the room number as she attempted to send me off immediately tipped me off and when I checked the card holder, I think we had been assigned a room on one of the lowest floors possible. I immediately returned and asked about the high floor preference and was met with a most disgusted look and informed that ""a higher floor is not a right"". Arguing that the lower floors may make it difficult for my son to sleep, the Hilton staff relented and promptly put us on the 25th floor (which was obviously open). I can honestly say it appeared that this simple gesture for her was absolute torture for her and this is how we had to start our vacation. This was not first time having this type of experience with the Hilton staff and I suspect it won't be my last.On that note, reading TripAdvisor and similar sites, I always thought it was funny how many people complained that Grand Waikikian (and other HGVC properties) was geared for Japanese tourists and Japanese tourists received preferential treatment. Speaking of my own experiences as a Japanese national and those of many of my friends here in Japan, I want to assure those reading this post that nothing could be further from the truth. If anything, due to the language difficulties and the cultural reluctance for Japanese people to complain, I would argue that Japanese tourists often get the short end of the stick.Lastly, before I forget, my wife was 4 months pregnant during our time and was suffering from morning sickness on the day that we were checking out. I explained the situation to the front desk and asked for a delayed checkout and was promptly denied due to ""being busy"". As my wife was ill, I even mentionned that I was an Elite member, but once again, denied. I guess in that sense, the Hilton staff are consistent in treating both Elite and non-Elite members poorly.As a HGVC owner, I am not happy having to post this negative review of a property that I own and frankly, I really do not expect that anything will change by this post aside from some template response from management. That being said, I really do believe that Hilton should make at least some effort to train their staff to provide even a minimal level of service. In closing, oddly enough, in my experience, I thought that all of the other HGVC properties actually provide much better service. Considering the costs and popularity of the Hawaii properties, I certainly expected Hilton to better services its guests, regardless of nationality.",New York,"Dragon26</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",19,1.0

We haven't been for many years and our last stay was actually in the Lagoon Tower (I have a previous review) which was nearly 7 years ago. This was long before the Waikikian was built. A few weeks ago we decided to do a mileage run to get me up to the next level of status on my preferred airline. We chose Waikiki as our destination and decided to stay at the HHV. This was a short trip for us (4 nights) so we took advantage of ""Open Season"" and paid ridiculously low rates for our suite, vs. using our points. A tip to other HGVC owners: the points redemption at the GW are somewhat higher than in the Lagoon Tower or Kalia Tower. If you are visiting for less than a week, I strongly recommend looking into the Open Season option vs. points if this is your preferred tower. That said, the Lagoon and Kalia offer perfectly nice accommodations at a much better value, so if points are your thing, I would look there first. As always, the service was impeccable. Everyone was friendly and accommodating from check in to check out. The room was also immaculate. We rented a two bedroom, partial ocean view and were placed on the 14th floor. Our view was of the marina and the lagoon. We could also see the rooftop luau. (Free show!)Beds were comfortable and everything was spotless. My only gripe about the room would be the showers. The shower heads were a bit of a challenge to get just right. They use handheld shower heads that can be adjusted to your height, which is nice. However the challenge is getting the angle right without having the handle crash to the floor. Not a deal breaker or anything to really complain about, but would be nice if the shower heads were more traditional and not the handheld type. Where I do have a moderate gripe is with regard to the wi-fi. For all owners and guests of HGVC wi-fi connectivity is free, however the connection strength is poor. In fact, poor doesn't do it justice. It was terrible. It was impossible to stay connected for longer than 30 seconds at a time before having to log-in again. If you want to stream video (watch a netflix video on your iPad for example) forget about it. At the most I think we had 2 bars of strength, which wasn't consistent. I ended up using my 3G for internet connectivity instead. My other gripe (and this is a big one) is the pool. I totally get that it's Hawaii and with this resort in particular, it is very kid friendly. I don't have children and I fully expected to see lots of kids at the resort. However, the GW pool is the only one on the property with a water slide and water slide = lots of kids. There were so many in the pool/around the pool it was impossible for me to enjoy myself and relax. In the past there used to be an adults only pool in the Kalia Tower. I was actually looking forward to spending my time there but learned that it was no longer available as an option. We ended up at the beach, which was totally fine (it is Hawaii afterall) but it would have been nice if the HHV dedicated a pool just for adults. Hopefully the absence of an adults only pool is only temporary. The other issue with the pool is with respect to the reserving of lounge chairs. We also own at Starwood and their policy is that if you leave your belongings unattended on the pool chairs for longer than an hour, they are taken away. Hilton has no such policy, at least that we could see was being enforced. People were arriving at early hours to 'claim their spot' and not returning until later in the day. This is incredibly obnoxious and inconsiderate behavior and a huge pet peeve of mine. I get that people can be/will be rude, but it's the job of the resort to ensure some sort of regulation around this. From what we could tell, this wasn't happening. Finally, something should be said about the hours of their restaurants and bars. We arrived really late on a Friday evening. By the time we checked into our room it was after 11 pm. We were shocked to find that not a single bar or restaurant on the HHV property was open except for the Round Table Pizza. What bar closes at 11 pm on a Friday night? Especially if your goal is to keep people on property and the majority of Waikiki stays open until the wee hours, you would think they would want to compete. Apparently not. Granted we could have walked into Waikiki, but after a 5 hour flight (and two hour time difference) we weren't exactly up for a stroll into town. We did really enjoy Tropics, though we never ate in the restaurant itself. We enjoyed live music in the lounge and snacked on pupus. Drinks were expensive, but strong and the pupus tasty. Overall, this is a great place to stay. The GW is a great facility, but to be honest, any of the other HGVC towers will do.

Our check in was a drama (especially after a 10 hour flight)! It was booked by a 3rd party (an Australian website) and upon check in I was told that our room had been cancelled. To cut a long story short after 45 minutes it was sorted out and we were allocated our room.We were a little disappointed that the room configuration was not what we were expecting and we had a ""city view"" . We had booked a 1 bedroom with two beds but instead got a 1 bedroom with King Bed and pull out sofa. After contacting management and our travel agent in Australia we could not change rooms. After the debarkle with check in this sadly left a sour taste but none the less we were in Waikiki so got offer the disappointment fast. The pull out sofa in the living room was fantastic as the kids thought it was a real treat to to have their own tv and Playstation. Having a washer, dryer and kitchen in the apartment was invaluable! The pool was a huge hit, especially the Super Pool. The kids would gladly have spent our entire stay in the pool but there was shopping to be done!!!!!It took us over half an hour to walk to restaurants not in the village. But the kids never whinged about it!!! The Friday night fireworks was great! Walking to Ala Moana Shopping Centre was easy! About 15 minutes (and that's walking with two slow coach kids in tow). And getting a Taxi back from there was not very expensive.Despite our initial check in hiccup (and wrong room allocation) we had an amazing holiday!!!!So great in fact that we are booked for 2013!!!! The kids are constantly talking about their Hawaiian experience (even though we didn't do anything besides swimming, shopping and eating!!!)","Melbourne, Australia","loveholidays20_123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",8,5.0

We booked a two bedroom ocean front property on a high floor (at a substantially higher cost in points). Everything about this property (and all of Hilton Hawaiian Village) is beautiful and the location is great. You are very close to Waikiki but are a little off the main roads so it is much quieter. The rooms are very well appointed with comfortable beds, full kitchens (although they really need Keurig coffee makers) and nice televisions. The shopping and restaurants on the property are very nice, and most are not outrageously priced (for a resort area). The shop in the Grand Waikiki and was great, with a nice selection of grocery, gift and drugstore items, along with ready to eat foods as well and everything was very reasonable. The staff in the store was super helpful as well. This property is within walking distance of the Ala Moana shopping mall as well as the shopping, restaurants, bars and beach at Waikiki. Everyone should make a point to find the Mai Tai bar at the Pink Palace (Royal Hawaiian Hotel) on Waikiki beach and get a beachfront table to watch the fabulous sunset as you enjoy the original Mai Tai (or the Royal Mai Tai – both are great). We experienced two problems which is why my overall rating cannot be higher. The first was that as I said above, we booked a room on a high floor, we again asked when checking in for a high floor, and said we would be happy to wait longer if we needed to. We arrived about 2 hours before check in time, so went to the hospitality room to wait. When our room was ready (just a little after the 4 pm check in time) we went back to the front desk to finish the process and again asked if we were getting a high room, he said it was very high. We then find out it is on the 17th floor (of a tower with 38 floors) and I said that I did not consider this to be a high floor. He said it was the best they could do. We said we could wait longer, and he said that would not make any difference as this was the unit we would get. We reluctantly headed to the unit. I will say it was ocean front, however since it was not very high, the view was nothing special. I contacted the front desk again to express my displeasure and was again assured nothing else was available. If this had been true, I would not have been upset, however we talked to numerous guests with rooms on much higher floors that checked in later the same day. One on them even told me how many points they used and it was MUCH LESS than what we had used. During our week of the 30-50 times I used the elevators I saw only two guests exit on floors below ours. Based on the number of people at the pools, etc. it was obvious that the property was not close to being full, however they did not honor our request for a high floor. I even talked to guests that were not Hilton owners that were given units on much higher floors. The management should have honored the specific reservation and requests that we made, or provided a better response that just – “that’s the way it is, quit asking”. The second problem was that while the pools and surrounding areas are beautiful, the water in the pools was much too cold to be comfortable. Most of the time there were only kids in the pools, since most adults found them cold (I visited with at least 20 people who said they could not get in them at all). We visited friends staying at two other Waikiki properties and both of their pools were MUCH warmer than those at the Hilton. The ocean and the man made lagoon were much warmer than the pools. Management needs to address this issue since a majority of their guests are adults. Hilton Grand Vacation Club is one of the best timeshare management programs there is, they have a lots of properties in great locations and their point system is very good. I hope we do not have a similar experience the future.Overall a Great Property that needs to provide additional training to some front desk staff.","Lahaina, Hawaii","Texascowboy3600</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lahaina, Hawaii</strong>",64,3.0

They do have though a hospitality room with plenty of seats to rest, spaious dressing room, several shower and toilets.Complimentary refreshments like coffee,tea and orange juice were offered too. Our suite was spacious and I love the interiors. There's a washer and a dryer provided and a steady supply of laundry detergent too. The kitchen was equipped with a big oven, microwave,blender and coffeemaker. On the downside, I find the cooking pans quite small if you're cooking for a family of five and they don't have any larger pans so that made our cooking options limited because of this. It's unfortunate because all their appliances were in full size (big ref, big oven,big stovetop). I also find the housekeeping inconsistent. On our arrival, I found some drawers very dusty and so were the lampshades and other furnishings. We stayed for seven nights and there were days when housekeeping was neatly or badly done. Most days it's not good.If not for this, i would rate this hotel a five. . The location of this hotel is excellent. Not in the busy area but still with quaint little shops and restaurants around. The beach in the property is quite nice and just walking distance from the hotel. Bell service was exemplary and we did not encounter any problem with the staff.

We rented a car because I'm not into taking a bus, and although we've stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village many times, I had a hard time finding the Grand Waikikian entrance. Minor detail, but we parked in the parking structure and made our way to the Grand Waikikian. Let me say, first of all that this place is gorgeous. It is very warm with floor to ceiling Hawaiian wood. Check in was a breeze and they welcome you with a Hawaiian necklace and a gracious Aloha and treat you like royalty. The room was not cheap, so our expectations were high. Our room was on a very high floor, but the elevator was quick and there really are very few suites per floor. The suite was great with a full kitchen and all utensils and soaps. There's a stacked washer and dryer. There are two Samsung TV's and a built in eating area. The suite was very well-apointed and would be perfect for families. And how nice to be able to wash your bathing suit and put it on clean and dry every day!! There is a gift shop in the lobby that stocks everything you need if you would like to cook. It is set back from the beach, but not far. We had sort of a city/mountain view but you still got a peek at the ocean.This is a time share property, so watch out for the hard sell. They will call you the second you walk into the room and invite you to come down for their pitch and ""free"" gift. They are very polite however.It is a very short stroll to Ala Moana shopping center. Try the Mai Tai Bar on the top floor with ocean breezes.

The rooms are fantastic - everything is brand new/modern, very spacious, and SO clean We had a one bedroom on the 28th floor mountain/city view. We were there as part of a timeshare exchange, but we only stayed for four days. Whenever we needed anything - especially clean towels, they were right there with them, at no charge. The only time we heard traffic was when we sat on our balcony, we were never disturbed while the sliding door was closed. We were treated to a nice little gift basket on our arrival for our honeymoon- really nice - above and beyond! Check in was a little slow - but extremely friendly. The valet and bellman were also very friendly. Improvements needed with concierge: two employees were very hard to approach and took time to ""warm up"" to us. When giving directions they acted as if we knew where we were, pointed, and rushed us along. And when I asked for opinions on restaurants for dinner - He abruptly pointed out the restaurant on site - which is probably a great restaurant, but I wanted personal/local advice and options. Then he handed me a magazine and said look at these restaurants. So I figured out our place to eat that night - and it turned out brilliant (might have to do a review on the Westin Surfrider restaurant!) For a snorkeling trip I was directed to a lovely young women at the inside office concierge - she was a doll - wish I got her name. So maybe go to the office concierge and not the concierge desks along the hallway? The turtle snorkel trip was great! Right at the Hilton pier - great staff, and we got to see turtles. AND it's only a one and a half hour trip! Which is great for a quick little trip right off shore, doesn't take up the entire day. Ok, read everyone elses reviews, it's a large resort. Lots of walking - its part of the Hilton Village. But close to a great little outdoor shopping area. The lagoon is freezing, couldn't get in, and the sand is really rough on the feet- but it's man made. Not enough Pools for the size of the resort and not enough chairs-the kind of hotel to get up early and get your chair. I abolutely refuse to do that. The Tapa pool was closed during our stay. Towels are awful!! Little little towels, and worn out. I think they should update these. And the one hot tub - close to the grand waikikian, closes at 7 PM - WAY too early!!!! That was a bummer. The beach on the Hilton side is cramped - and they charge something like $36 for beach chairs and umbrellas. I would just go down a little past Tropics and sit on the beach there - seemed MUCH less crowded. Tropics - great apps and happy hour music/band! I think this is not good for couples looking for romance- crammed up with families. Even in October. And I personally didn't enjoy Waikiki, especially on a honeymoon. Great to see the beach, diamond head, and have a great dinner and late night in the city, but one day/night was enough for me (I live in Philadelphia, I'm over the city vibe - but others look for that type of action with things at least being open late). Was easy to walk around - no choice, couldn't get a cab on the street! Great walkway along the beach from Hilton down past many properties, and lit up at night. And an awesome sunset - one of the best we were able to see. For a more relaxing time for couples I recommend the North Shore. We rented a car for a day and headed up there (about an hour drive) - it was amazing! And Pearl Harbor is very close also - the main reason we came to visit Oahu. Overall - Not one complaint about the room - great accomodations! And most of the staff was extremely friendly!! Just decide if you want city atmosphere, lots of walking, and many families. The atmosphere of this hotel (Grand W) is certainly high end and classy! It's a shame they rely on the Hilton Village for ammenities - that's where things go down hill just a little.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Jules92012</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",6,4.0

I learned a long time ago that one of the best aspects of a vacation is the prep work and consequently the expectations of a vacation. The number of points spent for a Grand Waikikian penthouse unit was almost prohibitive but we're glad we made the investment in our vacation. We were surprised, to say the least, on some of the amenities the unit possessed. For example, the toilet was one that both cleaned and dried thereby negating the need for toilet paper(nice). The view of the Friday night fireworks was excellent as we sat on our lanai. The size of the unit was extremely comfortable and the everyday maid service was right on time. The staff in the lounge was so great and always received us with a smile. My recommendation is if you have the points or cash and want to experience an extremely memorable week in Waikiki, give the GW a try.

We had booked the room directly through the Hilton website, so we had daily housekeeping, and only on one day was our room cleaned late, and the housekeeping staff apologized for the delay. I had done my research and knew my view would be that of a city, as this hotel is set back from the ocean. We had originally booked the Ali'i Tower, but felt that we needed more space and the kitchen amenities. I am incredibly picky about where we stay, and I was very happy with my unit.The CONS:Yes, the furniture was dusty, but I found the kitchen and bathroom clean.We had an issue with the washing machine in the unit, twice. However, both times, maintenance came up and reset the unit, and it worked.Distance from beach (hotel is not oceanfront, but via a long walk through the lobby, you emerge at the Great Lawn or a pool area)My kids only used the pool once, and as with many resorts, pool chairs were reserved by people who left their belongings...unable to find chairs.Didn't care for the ""bench style"" seating at the table in our room.Ridiculous charges for chair and umbrella rentals.Crowded beach.The PROS:Had several requests for housekeeping; my needs were met.Resort property is just stunning.My kids loved the lagoon activities (stand up paddling, canoeing, pedal boats).Wide, beautiful stretch of beach; we walked along the beach toward the Sheraton and the beach was narrow at the other properties we passed.My son loved the fish, penguins and flamingos on site.We enjoyed the live, nightly entertainment at the Tapa Tower.The Village is great (shopping and dining), enjoyed walking through the village after dinner.Very quiet front desk: line ups to check in and out weren't an issue.Free video rentals for each room (great for the kids).We enjoyed dinner at the Tropics, situated right by the beach.Previous reviews note that the HHV is busy and crowded, and in fact, there was a Convention going on and our property was at 100 % capacity. Yes, the Village, beach and pools are vey busy, mostly with young families. If you're looking for peace and quiet, the HHV isn't for you. And we found Waikiki busy, period. We walked down Kalakaua Avenue in the evening and it was incredibly crowded. We spent the following week in Maui, and it was quite the opposite: quiet and calm.The issue about the pool cards has me stumped. Upon check in, we were given orange pool cards, to be used in exchange for pool towels at one of the pool huts. I had read many complaints about this system but I thought it worked just fine: return the towels and get your cards back. Easy.With regards to the staff, front desk was fine, valet staff were friendly, and we only used the concierge once, and that experience went well.All in all, I'm glad I did my research as I generally knew what to expect.

The rooms were very dusty, the refrigerator was a mess with food residue, the inside of the cabinets was dirty, and the spare blanket was covered with stains. When we told the front desk, they said that someone would come to clean it - which never happened. On our second complaint, we were called and told that the mid-week cleaning could be done a day early. They did come to clean, but it was a mediocre job. The facilities are beautiful, but management need to reconsider their services.","Clearwater, Florida","GoCath</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clearwater, Florida</strong>",12,3.0

Our room 2802 had a great view of the water and the city. Maintenance came a time or two for small issues and they were timely and friendly. The sound bar that many of you see in photos near the television is NOT part of the TV but is connected to the DVD player. This was not an issue as my MP3 player would connect to it to provide ample Sara Evans to survive. Here is a tip that you can use. The parking elevator goes down to the street level. This helps as you bring back a heavy load from the ABC store. The reserving of pool chairs is a problem but I have no cure for this. We would head to the pool at 8am and that goes smoothly. Now a negative, HHV needs a decent workout room. On the morning that it rained we walked to the Kalia Tower to find about six treadmills for thousands of rooms! Each tower should have exercise facilities or a ratio of 3 treadmills for each bar on the property. The Mai Tai drinks at Tropics are great by the way (even at $12). Enjoy your visit.

We were told switching rooms would be simple (we had to do so because of availability)--her answer was that you'd better be out by 10am and we won't let you into your new room until 4pm. We have a young child who naps, and this does NOT work for us. I specifically asked about this when making reservations, and the Hilton representative said this would not be a problem. The room had lots of stuff broken in it, from HVAC (not cooling down below 79F), to sink not draining, to the dishwasher being totally useless (unless you completely washed the dishes before using it!). And the ""partial ocean view"" was a joke: you had to exit to the balcony and LEAN OVER to see a tiny sliver of ocean. Partial mountain view would have been slightly accurate. Full view of cheap hotels with their plastic lawn chairs on their balconies and the nonstop (round the clock, even with all windows and shades closed) sound of the busy street below, with buses and sirens going at all hours, is really the only accurate way to describe it. The front desk lady said ""too bad, this is what you get, be happy you're in Hawaii"". I've stayed at several Outriggers before and had a better view every time.The first day my kid and I got food poisoning at an on-site restaurant, and I just needed the single toilet bowl cleaned a bit (not the whole suite). The front desk staff REFUSED to do this without an additional cleaning fee for the entire suite. They finally said they would have the cleaning staff bring up the cleaning supplies but I would have to do it myself. Seriously??? Such a big deal over 2 minutes of effort? Their response: it's our policy, tough if you don't like it, we don't have to send anyone up at all. I said sure, I'll do it myself, and was ready to do it, but the non-front-desk staff at the hotel are all really nice and did it for me.The ""grand"" pools are a joke too, by comparison to other Hilton properties (e.g. Waikoloa). I can understand this since Waikiki is so dense, but it would have been good to know we'd be packed in like sardines in advance, just to set expectations. The concierge staff was nice but repeatedly gave us misinformation (e.g. when things open and close, how best to get places, etc.).I will NEVER be back here, and will continue telling everyone I know to stay away!","San Jose, California, United States","Polina S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California, United States</strong>",12,1.0

First of all, this is a huge complex, a city inside Waikiki itself. Fully self-contained. The hotel is very clean, staff was very pleasant and helpful, and the view (get an ocean view room) is quite nice, especially if you stay over on a Friday night and catch the firework from your balcony.There are some negatives. This is a very busy hotel. By noon, all the chairs by the swimming pool were occupied. This hotel was full of screaming kids (including my kids) at all its pool that it shares with the rest of Hilton Hawaiian Village. For the number of towers it has, the amount of pool is inadequate. Also, if you follow the direction to get to Hilton Hawaiian Village on the brochure, you WILL get lost. Call the hotel for directions and where to park for the Grand Waikikian (if you self-park) or else, you will exit into the middle of a very busy shopping plaza with no good way to get to the hotel.The kids love this hotel.

I've only stayed at HGVClub resorts in Oahu but the pool/chair space to amount of people should be criminal. The orange card towel exchange is a pain as well. Hilton Waikoloa is much better pool scenario. Some employees could care less about ""service"". Pros: Price due to timeshare usage. DVD kiosk. Location and fireworks on friday nights.

I even spoke to the General Manager, Henry Perez who once I finally got him on the phone at home , was offended that I had to talk to him and not his other managers after having such success while we were at the property.... Not. Let's break it down in detail:1) We were assaulted at the pool by another guest who felt we took his chairs. Maybe if there were enough chairs this wouldn't happen. Security was called and no one did anything to applogize or contact us about the incident my 5 year old is traumitized feomtge altercation. Additionally , for three straight days we watched locals use an assortment of room keys to get in and then proceeded to swim in their JEANS while all the locals that worked the pool looked the other way. 2) I specifically asked for a room with 2 double beds when I made the reservation. They gave us a King and when I asked why I was told ,"" we give preference to our owners not renters"". This is a timeshare property for Asain clients and if you are not Asian and a hotel guest you ate treated like garbage.3) On a particularly rainy day we stopped by one of tr concierge desks to ask for some tips to entertain our 5-year old. After she finally acknowledged our presence, she rudely asked what we needed . Once we told her he looked out side and snidely said ,"" it's a nice day out, why don't you go to the beach"". Wow, great job on that one!Once w returned home I took up the matter with Hilton Honors as I am a member . They were horrified at my story and told me they would have a reps ones in 72 hours. The supervisor never contacted me again. I kept pursuing the matter until I finally got a message a month later from the Hilton Honors supervisor that said the matter was resolved as the General Manager, Henry Perez ( complete waste of my time see above), had called me and the issue was resolved . HE lied and had not called to resolve the issue ever.After paying $3000 for our room for 5 nights I would not only NEVER stay here but will more then likely switch myself and my company of 1000 sales reps over to Marriott properties .","Laguna Niguel, California","Ripply13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Laguna Niguel, California</strong>",20,1.0

Have also stayted at 2 other towers within Hilton Hawaiian Village in the past. First room type - 6 nights - 1 bedroom unit - booked through ""timeshare tour special."" Beware - this saves a considerable amount of money - but - we felt treated like 2nd class citizens under this deal. They are clear that renters are treated different than owners. They gave us what was supposed to be a resort view unit but it ended up being City View and was right above Ala Moana Blvd. The traffic noise was so loud, even on a moderately high floor, that our balcony was not usable. In addition, there was construction going on. It was terrible and the managers had no empathy for us. I will say that the timeshare concierge was wonderful and understand - tried his hardest to help us move but when it did not work out they gave us $200 in restaurant vouchers. Another issue - the photos on the website show seating for 4 (at the dining table,then two more at the eat in counter in kitchen. This totals 4 dining chairs in the room, in addition to the built in bench at the table. This is false advertising - there are only two chairs in these 1 bedroom units and it looked as if something was missing. When I asked management about this, they have us such a hard time. After 3 phone calls and getting angry housekeeping brought us up 2 more chairs. Not sure why this had to be such an issue. Timeshare salesman was one of the most offensive people I've ever met. He turned the charm on at first, then turned it off and got angry at the end when he asked us why we want to throw our money in the garbage on our non-time share vacations. This were his exact words.2nd room type - 4 nights - 1 bedroom partial ocean view unit - this unit was paradise compared to the other. I had booked this myself as a rental via the Hilton site. Only could see a small part of the ocean but the absence of the traffic noise and street view was a big improvement. This until had all 4 dining chair, did not have to ask for more.Overall unit assessment - wonderful, modern decorations, clean but showing some wear and tear. Beautiful granite in kitchen and wood floors in living room. Washer/dryer was great to have but dryer was slow as others have noted.Employees were hit or miss at front desk - yes, some very rude. Others very nice. All bell hops and valets were super nice. Free video rentals was quite a treat. We loved the pool - did not find it hard to get a chair as others have posted. Prices of food at their market/shop were actually comparable to regular ABC stores and their selection was much more upscale.We love this resort - did not find it big and overwhelming or like Disneyland as others have stated. We had 2 boys age 8 and 9 with us and we loved being able to pick from several pools daily. This stretch of beach is magnificent compared to the rest of Waikiki....plenty of room even at Sunset to spread out and throw the football on the beach...never too crowded. We loved having the fish, birds, ducks, beautiful gardens to walk through every day.Since this was our 2nd stay here, we discovered many hidden treasures and tips. Get your hot dogs and snacks from the cart or snack bar from the Hale Koa next door - 1/3 the price than at hotel snack bars. If you are staying a while, it's worth a trip to Walmart to stock up on snacks and drinks to keep in the mini fridge. Parking is easy and cheap if you park in the Marina lot next door.....not a long walk if the weather is nice....who minds a walk in paradise? The rates go up on weekends so it's better to just self park in the deck then. Waikiki beach walk is very close and has lots of great places to each and shop......the whole Waikiki beach stretch is a very easy walk from the hotel. Starbucks is good but it's a treat to get your coffee from the Kona Mountain Coffee shop which is underneath the Grand Waikikian....we liked it better but it did not open till 9 AM.Definitely ask for use of the hospitality lounge if your flight leaves later than checkout. We did not take showers but did spend a few minutes in there. It was a nice benefit.","Cary, North Carolina","Maria R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cary, North Carolina</strong>",113,4.0

We were not disappointed. Having spent 9 nights there, our family will return to the GW on our next visit to Honolulu. Here's why: in addition to the location (HHV is perfect - convenient without the hustle-bustle of busier areas), the layout (convenience of having suite with a full kitchen and washer/dryer set cannot be beat!), we really appreciated the Concierge Desk. The staff were very friendly and helpful with our many questions. They gave good information and advice from restaurant recommendations to water activities to excursions. They made dinner reservations, arranged surfing lessons and booked our visits to popular sites (e.g. Pearl Harbor; Wakilea Premium Outlet; Hanauma Bay), all with smiles and good wishes to us for a great time.We were glad to be upgraded from partial oceanview to having a fantastic oceanview (but still under the same rate category as ""partial"" oceanview). When we reported a minor issue with the in-suite dryer, our trouble call was answered quickly (approx 15 mins). The HHV staff member was friendly and efficiently repaired the issue. While we had easy access to the beach we could use the pools (also the one in Lagoon Tower) when we wanted a change. The free DVD rental with very good selection of movies was great for our downtime. Our teenagers loved having our own in-suite PS3 system. Like others have mentioned in this forum, the only less-than-perfect item is their open bathroom in the master bdrm (we stayed in a 2-bdrm suite). This concept works for couples only and even so, it would have been nicer to have privacy in the bath.

We stayed at Lagoon tower's 1 bedroom unit in 2010 and decided to try Grand Waikikian's 1 bedroom unit this time, in slow season (so we can afford the exchange points). We were very impressed with the unit. Definitely a plus to have washer and dryer in the room as we were travelling with children. We were first given room 1712 which faces Ala Moana Boulevard. We were not impressed with the noise from the lanai. We asked for a room change and were moved to unit 901 the following day (due to all the units being full on the day we arrived). What a difference! 901 is one of two units facing directly south (partial ocean view past Lagoon Tower and Marina). 901 is also a corner unit with windows facing east. We were enchanted by the luau on the parking rooftop Sundays to Thursdays. We were so close, we could hear and see everything. Be sure to ask ahead of time for a partial ocean view if you are doing points exchange. 9th floor is also only partly taken up by units -- we think the remaining are for utilities, equipment, etc. The hallways are very quiet, and we had free Honolulu Advertiser paper by the elevator each day. The unit had a very spacious master bedroom. Kitchen was nicely finished, with a open concept. We had a separate eating area and living room. The bathroom had very nice glass door shower and large soaker tub.We had stellar service as well. We had a low battery indicator on the room safe. When we called, the security personnel came within 1 minute to open the safe for us. Then the service person came within the hour to replace the battery. We also had quick service with requests for toilet paper, and problems with Sony Playstation. We were given unlimited access to DVDs (machines near elevators). We weren't sure if the Blu Ray DVDs were scratched or the Sony Playstation, but 2 out of 3 DVDs had issue playing. We told the service person and he replaced the Playstation within an hour.The 8th floor Arrival/Departure lounge for owners was very impressive. (We could have used it when we last stayed at Lagoon tower, but did not need to due to our flight times.) There's a separate room for children to play (bring your own toys and DVDs as activities are limited). There are free lockers and showers -- very clean and luxurious. They also had several areas laid out for different groups to sit and relax with some privacy. We didn't realize that we could have used this lounge everyday. There were juices, teas, coffee for refreshments. There are 2 laptops and printer for limited use (15 minutes max, print 5 pages max). We used this to print our boarding passes. The staff were very friendly.As for pools, we were familiar with all of them from our last visit (see my previous review in 2010). I was surprised that the paradise pool was so busy on the weekends, as this was supposed to be slow season, but we were always able to find chairs. The lagoon and beaches are just as we remembered. Lots of room to accommodate everyone.We enjoyed watching the Friday night 7:45pm fireworks from the beach. We almost felt we were too close, feeling the heat and the thunder. It was spectacular.In comparing the Grand Waikikian and Lagoon Tower 1 bedroom suites, I would say that location wise, Lagoon Tower is closer to the rest of the Hilton Hawaiian Village shops and restaurants, and pools. Grand Waikikian is much more luxurious. We are already planning to come back Spring Break 2013, but due to the points we have, we will be going to Lagoon tower.

We stayed for 6 nights at the end of March/beginning of April 2012, and the 1 BR was spacious enough that we didn't feel as if we were stepping on each other - we could spread out a bit. The kitchen was functional enough that we cooked nearly every meal in our suite. I highly recommend hitting one of the local farmer's markets for amazing produce. Our 1BR was ""city view"" which meant facing Ala Moana, a very busy road. In addition, they were doing road construction at night. However, the sliding door and windows installed in the unit was amazing and blocked out 100% of the noise. The Grand Waikikian rooms have a washer/dryer right in the unit, which was great. The proximity to the lagoon and the beach is what really made it fantastic.We have two 6 year old kiddos who are good swimmers, but inexperienced in oceans. The beach is excellent - very protected so we didn't have to worry about the kids getting swept out in a big wave. Beaches farther east on Waikiki had a LOT more wave action and I was glad we weren't trying to swim there. But the lagoon was the bigger hit with our kids.

Honestly we are disappointed. Let me write cons and pros below:Cons:(1) When we checked in, we were told that they only have a room with full beds. When I told her that I reserved a room with a King size bed, she just told me ""That was your request. We didn't have a room."" She even did not tell us sorry! I definitely did not like the stuck-up attitude of this black long-haired Japanese-looking lady at the reception.(2) Moreover, right after we checked in, we were taken to ""Concierge,"" who explained us the amenities of the vast complex. But there was a true reason why the Concierge had to explain this to us, instead of the stuck-up lady at the reception. They want to sell their condos to customers! This hotel is basically a condo/time share, and rents rooms when they cannot fill the room with time share. Therefore, whenever a hotel guest shows up, they want to sell their condo to us! The Concierge lady even asked my annual salary (to see whether I qualify for their credit I suppose)! I wasted like 30 minutes for this crap before we finally checked into our room!(3) It is a part of the huge Hilton Hawaiian Village (sharing with other Hilton hotels). This implies that, even though you might be paying much more than a typical Hilton hotel in Waikiki, all the pools and stores are shared with guests from other Hiltons. Basically, a lot of family and kids. It was impossible to find a chair on the pool side. You probably paid like 400+ per night, but you end up sharing everything except for the room with people paying like 150-200.(4) Parking is not connected to the hotel, and you need to walk a long walk. If you choose to use valet, you wait 15 min to get your car instead of walking for 10 min.(5) Staff are not used for hotel guests. When I asked what time the beds are made, I was told ""we clean up the room every once a week. You need to pay for more."" The truth is, for a hotel guest, they do bed making every day, but many staff don't remember that, it seems.(6) The bed (two full size instead of one king) is one of the worst that i have ever had in a decent hotel. My hip sank like 5 inches. Unless you sleep n the edge of the bed, you suffer this sinking... Both my girlfriend and i suffered a back pain. It is unacceptable for a decently priced hotel.(7) I wish they had salt, pepper, and some basic stuff in the kitchen. You need to buy everything!(8) They have a lot of restaurants and bars, but all are sort of disappointing. They are what you should expect from 200-per-night hotel for large tourist groups.Pros:(1) It's a condo. You have a full kitchen. If you don't want to waste money for not-so-great food in Waikiki (compared with Tokyo or NY), you can cook yourself!(2) The room is huge, equipped with DVD players (there is a free DVD rental service for guests), PS3, and iPhone-compatible stereo. If you like the feel of living, you'll be happy.(3) There are a lot of pools and an artificial lagoon, although the temperature of all are definitely below the ocean (it was cold!)(4) It's conveniently located, in the middle between Ala Moana Shopping center, and Galleria DFS. Both are sort of walking distance (we drove).At the end, if you want a kitchen, but don't care about a lot of crowded pools or not being on the beach, Trump is a much much better option for possibly similar prices. If you don't care about kitchen, well, there is no reason to choose this hotel. Choose some suite room in one of the smaller but better-graded hotels. I recommend Halekulani but it's a bit pricy.

This time, with 5 of us, we upgraded to a Premier 2 bedroom, our view was straight out to the gorgeous sunset, over the marina. We could watch surfers all day long, see the Friday night fireworks from the lanai (really loud echo off the Illikai). It was called a ""corner ocean view"" by the staff checking us into the hotel. I had read about a lack of service here, and found this trip it was completely the opposite experience for us, we were treated quite well, and anything we needed was ours by pressing one button on the phone. We were advised there would only be a midweek cleaning, as we were staying a week on my Hilton Grand Vacations Club points. We called a few days into the week and said we needed more towels & shampoo, they were there in minutes. When the technologically challenged 3 of us messed up the TV, we pressed the customer service button and about 30 minutes later we were helped by Joanne from Maintenance. She was great! She walked us through how to manage the TV, DVD player, stereo system, and channel 4, which is SO beautiful in the hotel! We looked down on the twice weekly luau and had that lovely music on the lanai at dinner time. Even the always shady lagoon pool was just below our room, and we watched the filming on Hawaii 5-0 from our deck one afternoon. We bought some beach chairs for $25 at the ABC store and used them the whole week, instead of paying $11 per day to rent a beach chair. Most days we sat at the Hilton Lagoon, which was warmer than both the ocean and the Ocean Pool at the Hilton (very cold). I rented a Paddle Board on the lagoon ($30 hr) and was a little bored after the first 20 minutes. A couple of times around the lagoon and you're done. It's is a great workout and the boards at the Hilton Lagoon are nice and new. Service at the Tropics bar and pool were excellent. Almost all the food served at the pool comes pre-packaged from the same place, the grab and go next to the Ocean Pool. Meals eaten onsite were very good, Tropics Bar (except one poor breakfast item), Japanese Restaurant in the Bazaar, Round Table Pizza and Lapperts Ice Cream were all excellent and not unreasonable priced. We walked almost everywhere, just minutes from the Ala Moana and it's excellent food court, We needed a cab to Pearl Harbor and the Diamond Head Trail, so location is great. We rented a car for a circle island trip one day, watched the surfers at Bonzai Pipeline and Makapu Beach. Yes, the resort is huge, there is a lot going on all the time, but if you are sitting out at the lagoon, you don't feel overcrowded at all. We were there a full week, everyone who worked in the hotel was very friendly and said Aloha as we walked by. I will mention that I do always travel with ear plugs, and this is one of those places you will need them. Honolulu has a lot of traffic noise, but there also is a plethora of things to keep you entertained.

Alas, it has been over a month and I just can't shake my overall poor impression. Which means that I will have to post this review despite the fact that we were upgraded to a three bedroom penthouse unit on the top floor. Now before you close this review in disgust about me, assuming that I am a prima donna who cannot be satisfied, let me disclose that I write from our $120/night room at the Residence Inn in Overland Park, KS where we are having a wonderful stay visiting family for the holidays. So I don't need any kind of over the top luxury to have a good time, but as the price creeps up, and when certain ""amenities"" appear to be present, then my expectations do change.So, we booked a two bedroom ocean view unit at the Grand Waikikian over Thanksgiving. About a week ahead of time, their travel coordinators called and helped answer all of my questions about the unit and the amenities at the hotel - I had several questions about the kids club, about the spa, about the other activities at the resort, and about other activities we had planned while on the island. She was so knowledgeable and friendly, taking so much time with me on the phone, that I was actually more excited about the trip after talking with her! We used the recommended hotel transportation company to book a car service to pick us up. The driver was terrific and gave us his card so he could take us back to the airport when we left the island. He charged literally HALF what we paid en route to the hotel. If you want his number, message me.We happened to mention just as we were approaching the Hilton Hawaiian Village that we were staying at the Grand Waikikian, and that is very important information since there are two different hotel entrances. Ask your driver to drop you off at the Grand Waikikian or you'll have to trek through the grounds with your bags, and as several other reviewers have indicated, no one who works at the resort knows where anything else is located, and the signs and maps are not precise enough to be helpful.Up to the point of arriving at the check-in line at the hotel, the whole experience was really wonderful even with the very expensive airport transfer. When we got out of the car, we were greeted by lovely smiling faces and kukui nut leis for everyone. The appearance of the check-in area is beautiful, and consistent with a full-service hotel. We waited for some time in the check-in line, even though there was only one family in front of us. When we finally got to the front of the line, the person checking in was very disoriented and typed madly into the computer for several minutes without any word or update (think of the scene in Honeymoon in Vegas when Nicolas Cage is trying to get a flight to Hawaii to win back Jennifer Aniston). She finally looked up and said, ""It looks like you've been upgraded to a penthouse unit, so you can check in upstairs on the 35th floor if you want."" I asked if we had to go to the 35th floor to check-in and she told us that we could check in there where we already were, but that we ""might want to go to the 35th floor to check in."" We flew 10 hours to get to Oahu from Atlanta and my wick was rather short, so I figured rather than ask her again to check us in, we would just go upstairs and check in where she seemed to want us to go. The trek to the 35th floor was long and arduous. The layout of the hotel is odd in that the main lobby is separated from the elevator bay that leads to rooms by two long hallways, lined by ""concierge desks"" that appear to be focused on sales of timeshare units. We finally got to the 35th floor and ended up spending at least 45 minutes getting checked in there because ""they didn't have a record of our reservation,"" though I brought the printed confirmation with us and gave it to her. In the end, of course, we didn't complain since they upgraded us from a two bedroom to the most exquisitely beautiful three bedroom unit on the top floor.We figured that it would be nothing but smooth sailing from here. How bad can it be from the penthouse suite? Truthfully, our stay in Hawaii was wonderful, and of course we did enjoy our spacious suite very very much. The lanai facing out toward the ocean was absolutely delightful and naturally there is nothing to complain about AT ALL regarding the features of the suite. I have never before, and very likely never again will, stayed at a place as nice as that penthouse suite. The kids ADORED the Toto toilets/bidets.However, the niceness of the suite only served as a more stark contrast with the poor service provided by hotel staff. One example was when I called to find out about the kids program. I wanted to sign up my children for a session but was told that not only could they not tell me over the phone whether there was availability, but I had to physically walk all the way from the Grand Waikikian to the main Hilton Hawaiian Village check-in area to find out if they had availability and to sign up. Really? OK. So I walked all the way, only to find that all of the sessions we were interested in signing up for were already full. Another example occurred on our first morning there when we were looking for a place to have breakfast on the resort. We literally walked around for 25 minutes looking for the Rainbow Lanai, having asked three staff people that we bumped into, where to find it. We were either given incorrect directions or the staff people just didn't know. Several staff people milling about the main check in area saw us looking around clearly lost at 6:00am, but no one offered to help us. When we finally did find the breakfast place (it was temporarily in another building due to construction), we were extremely disappointed in the quality of the breakfast buffet. We paid $90 for our breakfast for two adults and two kids and the waffles were rock hard while the rest of the food was unremarkable at best. DO NOT EAT ON THE RESORT, except at Roundtable Pizza where you will get what you expect - greasy, decent pizza at only slightly elevated prices.. Best low cost and quick breakfast we found was the Wailana Coffee House across Ala Moana. Best breakfast buffet - about 20 minute walk with our five year old slow poke - was at the Moana Surfrider hotel. Before we fully learned not to eat at the resort, we ordered room service and once again were amazed at the gaping difference between food quality (very, very low) and price (very, very high). Another unsettling experience is the bus/shuttle terminal which serves the entire Hilton Hawaiian Village resort. I understand why they need to do this given the size of the resort, but there is an unmistakable air of being treated like chattel when one is waiting for a shuttle to an off-site activity (such as the Paradise Cove luau or our shuttle to Hanauma Bay to snorkle). Not to mention that it is a solid 15 minute walk from one's room at the Grand Waikikian to the bus pick up. It would actually be quicker and more convenient to arrange your pick-ups and drop-offs at the Ilikai Hotel which is right across the street from the Grand Waikikian. We got off at this stop when we returned from Paradise Cove and were in our room with our tired kids probably 20 minutes sooner than if we'd gone on to the Hilton Hawaiian Village stop.On top of all this is the ambiance created by their treat-customers-as-criminals approach regarding pool towels and wristbands, mentioned by other reviewers. Though we were upgraded to a suite we clearly could never afford to pay for at full price, we were still paying $650 per night for the two-bedroom suite we originally booked and so all of this poor service leads to a little bit of a bad taste in the mouth.The piece de resistance was that when we traveled to Oahu in November, the high temperatures outdoors were hovering right around 80 degrees. Not super hot. The one pool that my kids would want to play in - the one with the slides - was absolutely FREEZING. I couldn't even stand in the shallow one foot deep water for more than 10 minutes at a time. The hot tubs were overflowing with people - many of the children with visibly blue lips - and my kids ultimately didn't swim because they were too cold. The pool with slides does not get any direct sun at all throughout the day because it is located in the shadows between several buildings. They need to add a heater to that pool for it to be enjoyable. Luckily, we did play in the lagoon, renting stand up paddle boards two days in a row. Overall, I doubt we would return to any property at Hilton Hawaiian Village for all of these reasons. I am likely to look for adjoining rooms at a hotel closer to the action on Waikiki that will cost about the same as the suite at the Grand Waikikian. But especially in these economic times, I feel like I shouldn't settle for being treated this way when I am paying this much.","Atlanta, Georgia","husbus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",49,3.0

The room was clean and exactly as pictured on the internet, although it was smaller than I'd imagined, in particular the bathroom which was quite tight. Personally I disliked having a bath in the bedroom, but aside from this the suite was nice. Although we didn't cook the kitchen was perfect for breakfasts and the washer/dryer extremely useful. The hotel provided a crib for our son and our daughter slept on the sofa bed. While the main bed was quite comfortable the sofa bed was not and I wouldn't recommend any adults plan to spend too long sleeping there. Next time we would book a two bedroom suite based on this fact alone!The check-in service at the Grand Vacations was poor, with a very disinterested and unhelpful staff member at the desk. We had originally tried to check-in at the general Hilton Hawaiian Village reception as this was where we were ushered when we got out of our taxi (our driver didn't drop us at the Grand Waikikian, but rather the general entry point). The documentation sent by the hotel did not specify that we should check-in at the Grand Waikikian either - this wasn't a huge drama but I thought I would mention it to stop others from wasting 20 minutes standing in line at the wrong check-in desk.Our package included daily housekeeping. The service, when we received it, was ok. However, on one day the housekeeper arrived at 8 am so we sent her away as we just weren't ready. We did request fresh towels and for her to remove the rubbish from the room. As other reviewers mention, it isn't possible for housekeeping to return so if you send them away you should be aware of this.We also booked an airport transfer through the hotel. We clearly specified that we would need two baby seats (we checked this again when the front desk called to confirm the booking). We were quite disappointed and concerned when the taxi that arrived only had one seat (at 5 am with not a huge amount of time to spare for our flight we really didn't have many options available to us either). Again, it is difficult to ascertain whether this was the fault of the taxi company or the hotel, but no having a good relationship with a reputable taxi/car service seemed like another example of patchy service.Location wise, the Hilton Hawaiian Village is very convenient. It is a short walk to Ala Moana in one direction and to Waikiki in the other. The Village also has just about everything you might need in terms of food and entertainment and I am sure many people never venture through the gates. Obviously a place of this size is a bit soulless and if you prefer personalised attention and service this probably isn't the hotel to stay at.","Mount Pleasant, Australia","DenJenK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mount Pleasant, Australia</strong>",66,4.0

I was booked originally in a studio in a neighboring building. When I saw the tiny studio I pleaded with management to give me something better and both managers Steve and Shiho went above and beyond to make my vacation a pleasant one. I ended up spending 8 days in the GW and it was lovely. The room seems very new, with hardwood floors, a living area, full kitchen, breakfast table, balcony with a view (depends on what room you are in), a sunken tub, a walk-in shower, a bedroom, free internet, daily newspaper, and no maid service. The kitchen comes equipped with all you need to cook, and there is a stove, fridge, icemaker, microwave and dishwasher. All appliances are very nice. The room was immaculate upon entry (not so much when we left!). The balcony was nice size, with a table and a few chairs and had a view of the mountains and downtown. The service was excellent across the boards. From checkin to the bellmen to housekeeping, everyone was professional, pleasant and efficient. Some of the people working in the restaurants and bars could have used a little training, but all in all, we were well taken care of. The resort is huge. There are seven or eight buildings, with three belonging to HGVC and the others part of the Hilton hotel. The place is overrun with foreign tourists. There is a shopping mall right in the resort with many stores, restaurants, Louis Vuitton, Starbucks, etc. It is very nice and convenient, and pretty pricey. There are four pools, all of which are nothing special. There is no sun protection in the way of umbrellas or shady areas, so that was an issue. Also, they are all very crowded and lots of screaming kids. There are a few nice beach bars and restaurants, and a very very nice lagoon on the property for swimming and boating. The hotel is right on the beach, and very nice. If you want an umbrella or chair, you'll pay dearly ($60 for two chairs and an umbrella). The downside is, everything is far. The gym is in the Kalia building, which is about a ten minute walk from us. There are a lot of aerobic machines, but not much else. The place was packed, with not a free machine, at 7am. The spa locker room and sauna costs $17 per day, but the gym is free. The spa woman was one of those ""sour"" ones that, when asked about the internet at the spa pool, responded, ""we don't issue that kind of information."" With the size of the place, you'd think that they'd train the staff to help visitors find things, but constantly, when asking a staff member where something was located, they never knew where anything was or how to get there. That was very strange. The grounds, pools, beaches were all immaculately clean and beautiful. At the pools, you are required to wear wrist bands and turn in cards for towels. If you lose the cards before checkout, you pay $10 per card lost fee. I found it a bit irritating, but they do it to keep non-guests out and I can understand that. The center of Waikiki is a 15 minute stroll, or a $5 cab ride, but there are plenty of dining choices nearby and inside the hotel. There are amazing upscale malls everywhere, with multiple designer stores from every high end brand you can think of. Since I was upgraded I felt the value was good for me. If I were to pay $650 or so for this room on this property, I might be a little upset. There are many beautiful luxury resorts in the center that I would select before this one. However, if you are traveling with kids, like the hubbub of a big resort, then Hilton is the one. All in all, a great place to stay if you can afford it and don't mind being a bit outside the center.","Savannah, GA","Mikestages</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Savannah, GA</strong>",112,4.0

You also get a card to be able to rent free dvd's at the dvd kiosks around the lobby. There is extra charge for parking and valet. We opted for valet since I think the price difference was like a few dollars only. You have to pay extra for a beach bed and umbrella if you want one on the beach. I find that the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard before. And its not a one time fee for your stay, its a daily fee of I think $25 for a beach bed and another I don't know for the umbrella. I couldn't believe it. I mean when do you go to beach resort and be charged extra to be able to stay at the beach when your a paying guest. I could understand if your just a beach wanderer, but a guest of the hotel? They said its to keep track of their beach beds and umbrellas cause they've lost a lot, but really. If you found a system for the beach towels, why not find a better system for the beach bed and umbrellas. We tried laying on the sand with just our beach towels but didn't last long cause the sand would still burn our toes if it hit it. So we moved by the pool area, because the beach beds and umbrellas were free to use there, you just need to wear this bracelet that they give you upon check in so they know your a guest of the hotel. I understand why they have to protect themselves, their location is truly great, and I'm sure there are freeloaders from other places that pretend they are guests and use all their amenities, but I think they have to find a better way to treat their real guests and make them truly feel like their guest is in paradise. It just ruins the whole experience. All these extras that shouldn't be extras. Without all these little frustrations, there is really no need to leave this place. The restaurants around are great. They have shops in the area, including an ABC which is the same price as the ABC outside the hotel, they didn't jack up the prices, so you can buy whatever you need for the kitchen. I really want to love this place, and I did before, but I just didn't like the extras for every little thing.","makati, philippines","cammy79</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>makati, philippines</strong>",9,4.0

A/C is not cold...maintenance came in twice and told us that it was the best they could do and we should close our shades. We did close our shades and it lowered the temperature from 77 to 75...still not even room temperature. 1+ hour to deliver toilet paper...usually when somebody requests toilet paper, it's at least somewhat immediate. And, probably the most disappointing is the ""partial"" ocean view. Don't shell out $$ for this room. We're staring smack dab at downtown Honolulu, but if we go to the edge of our deck and lean over (which is quite dangerous on the 23rd floor), then we catch a tiny glimpse of a dock with some boats and some water.

We were in a two bedroom, two bath, full kitchen city view room. All in all, we had a great time at the Grand Waikikian, and if you want to vacation at a resort in Honolulu, this timeshare-hotel-resort can't be beat. However, there are a number of tradeoffs that you make when you stay at the Hilton Grand Waikikian.The Room. Overall, we were very pleased with the room. Clean, and very functional. We particularly liked the breakfast bar/counter where our kids could eat and do their little projects. The dining table was also a diner-style booth that easily seated five people, but was never in the way like a true dining table. The master bathroom did not have a separate bathroom ... the soaking bathtub, the shower, and the sink was adjacent to the bedroom with no wall or door separating it. I personally don't like this layout because it doesn't separate the sleeping quarters with the bath area. The room also had all sorts of electronic toys including a PlayStation 3 and DVD players. There's even a free RedBox style DVD rental machine in the lobby so you can get movies and games to entertain yourself.The Facilities. The Hilton Hawaiian Village is essentially a self-contained resort adjacent to Waikiki. The TV show Hawai'i 5-0 uses it frequently as a backdrop. There's a small mall, lots of restaurants, an artificial salt-water lagoon, and of course a sandy beach. There are even penguins and flamingos for your entertainment. The best part of our experience was the pools. There's a new pool complex adjacent to the Waikikian that includes two hot tubs, and three water slides, including one that's totally appropriate for toddlers. It's a fantastic play area for small children. The complex also has a free fireworks show on Friday nights on the beach. Get takeout dinner, and have a picnic on the beach while you wait for the great show. Finally, the self-parking lot is a challenge. It's not large enough for a resort complex of this size, so you unfortunately end up needing to valet, unless you want to spend a material portion of your vacation hunting for parking.There are unfortunately several considerations that make the Grand Wakikian a marginal experience at luxury hotel prices. First and foremost, I felt like I was being nickeled and dimed everywhere. I needed to keep track of plastic cards to get pool towels or suffer a $10 surcharge. I needed to wear a wrist band to get into the pool. There's no food service at the pools, but there was a ton of security like people telling us what we could not do. And there were a number of housekeeping / upkeep ""misses"", not the least of which was the garbage that was collecting on the window ledges, including several cigarette packs. I really don't want to see garbage when I sit on the lanai (patio). Finally, there's a bit of a disconnect between the price and the service. The price was luxury, but the service was just ""average Hilton"". Not bad service, but I was expecting better for the price.Then there's the location. On paper, it looks great ... close to Waikiki, close to Ala Moana Shopping center. But unfortuately, it's not close enough to be truly walkable to either places. So you need to take the bus or taxi, or get a car and suffer the parking issues. And you definitely need a car if you want to go to a grocery store or a big-box retailer for basics. Of course, this is not a problem if you are using the Grand Waikikian and the Hilton Hawaiian Village as a self-contained resort. BUT, if you want a self-contained resort, there are a lot of other choices on O'ahu and the other Hawaiian Islands that are frankly better choices. That is the tradeoff with the Grand Waikikian ... you pay for the privilege of being in the heart of Honolulu, which is a great city with a lot of things to explore and experience. If this isn't a priority, you have many other options to consider.In summary, if you want to stay in a new fully-equipped one or two bedroom hotel in the heart of Honolulu, you can't go wrong with the Grand Waikikian. Just understand that you are paying for that privilege.","San Francisco, California","PoodleRank</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",107,4.0

We loved it so much that we actually bought into the HGVC (more on that later).ACCOMODATIONS: This is definitely a nice hotel. Clean, nicely decorated, and has a well equipped full-kitchen and a washer and dryer. Make sure to ask for suppies for the week when you call down to the desk (coffee, laundry soap, dishwasher soap, pillows, towels, etc.). Otherwise, you'll be tipping out the yang for people to bring them to you everyday. We had a 2 bedroom suite. The master bedroom has it's own bathroom/soaking tub, but that room does NOT have any windows that open to the exterior and the thermostat is regulated by the temperature of the rest of the condo. The 2nd room has a bathroom next to it (just outside the room) w/a shower and no tub. That room has a slider to the exterior which is nice for fresh air. HOWEVER, if that slider or the slider to the living area is open, the A/C turns off (SMART A/C system). Thus...causing a ""sauna"" situation for the master bedroom. Both bedrooms had king beds and the living room had a sofa sleeper (both rooms and the living room have TV's). There's a ceiling fan in the living area which is nice for sleeping. There was a video gaming system in the living area but we didn't use it. There is also WiFi that you have to pay for unless you are a HGVC owner, then they provide you w/a password. I think it was $10 a day but since we were there on a ""promotional"" mini vacation, they waived the fee for us.LOCATION: This hotel is in a SUPERB location. It is walking distance from the International Market as well as ""high dollar"" shopping. The hotel has it's own lagoon which is great for snorkeling, etc. There aren't any waves so don't expect to body surf and and the ""beach"" around it isn't great unless you have chairs. It's pretty compacted (hard) similar to a decomposed granite track (like that which surrounds a football field). The actual beach is just beyond the lagoon and you can walk up and down it to other hotels, bars, restaurants, etc. The pool is fabulous with a water slide for the kids. Not as nice or as big as the one in Waikoloa (on the big island of Hawaii). Towels cans be checked out but make sure you return them by the end of the day or you will be charged. Also, check w/the bellhops...they have all types of goodies in their luggage closet that people purchased and then left behind (styrofoam ice chests, chairs, boogie boards, etc.). TRANSPORTATION: In my opinion, you really don't need a car unless you want to drive around the island. We booked a dive trip but the company came and picked us up at the hotel (many of the excursions include transportation). If you do have a car, parking can be a challenge and can be costly. We rented a car because we got a killer deal so we parked in the parking structure in the adjacent military hotel and it was reasonable with in/out privileges.DINING: Food and alchoholic beverages cost an arm and a leg so we did some shopping off site and ate most of our meals in the room (plus we got some pre-mixed Mai Tai and Pina Colada mix...we'd make drinks and then take them down to the pool). Most of the dining in the ""village"" was very high priced but if you walk a block or two, there's plenty of reasonably priced places to eat. Hawaii is big on ""plate"" meals and noodle bowls. We also found this great Itallian place on one of the side streets across from the hotel...the owner is a nice older gentleman that was standing at the main intersection there handing out flyers and giving ""tourism"" tips...LOTS of tourism tips;-)THINGS TO DO: We've been to Hawaii many times so we hit the activities desk to see what other fun things they had to offer. We are divers so we did a combination SCUBA/SNUBA trip. My daughter wasn't certified so she did SNUBA (they float the air tank on a raft and have 20 ft hoses with regulators. It's like SCUBA diving but w/o all the equipment on your back and you only go down as far as your hose allows). If you haven't been to Diamond Head, you have to do it at least once. It's a great hike but it's not too difficult. I wouldn't take small kids...you can't take a stroller or anything since there are stairs...LOTS and lots of stairs. There's zip-lining, para-sailing, snorkeling...you name it (but you also pay for it!!!). Nothing is cheap in Hawaii, that's for sure. We chose to borrow some boogie boards and take our snorkeling gear to the other side of the island. One day we hit the military beach where they rent out bungalos (you have to have military I.D. though) and had a blast. Beautiful sandy beaches, lifeguard tower, convenience store...We also stopped at Laniakea Beach one day (the locals call it ""turtle beach"" and it's outside Haleiwa on Waialua Bay). It's not very visible from the road and you'll miss it if you don't know where it is because it's not one of the main beach parks, but it's great. Turtles everywhere...just remember, it's a huge fine if you touch a turtle...they are a protected species now. You can look at video and photos that people have posted on Trip Advisor by searching Laniakea Beach or by going to this link: http://tripwow.tripadvisor.com/slideshow-photo/laniakea-beach-turtle-beach-oahu-hawaii-by-travelpod-member-bakasyonista-oahu-united-states.html?sid=11529042&fid=tp-9&supkl=kl&m=10995&supkw=%22Turtle+beach%22+oahu","Granite Bay, CA","WendyS542</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Granite Bay, CA</strong>",15,5.0

They have a great swimming pool with a water slide for the kids. It was a close walk to the beach - not exactly right outside the door but maybe 5 minutes away. The Hilton property is huge with lots of things to do. They had penguins and flamingos. At 8am Monday thru Friday you can go down to the penguin area for a ltitle talk about the penguins and they let you touch one of the penguins and feed the turtles. This was our second time back and we'll definetly be back again next year. In addition, there's a hospitality room for people who want to shower/freshen up before leaving the facilities.

Someone else wrote about the noise and that's so true. And that beeping in the morning - sounds like a backup bell but louder. Just the traffic, I guess. Hard to tell just what the noise is - not people. But, with your door closed, you don't hear it. We had two queen size beds and a nice view of the ocean from bed. The living room had a couch that made into a bed, too. Nice furnishings and a TV in both the living room and bedroom. Our view was directly across from Hawaiian Village Tapa Tower but you still had a wonderful view of the ocean and a beautiful view of the city behind at night. We were in room 2909 and it had a great bathroom with both shower and tub and a nice kitchen. You could cook meals here if you were so inclined. If you want to bring your own coffee or buy coffee there, bring cone filters. Otherwise, you can use the coffee they supply in the packages with the coffee already in the filter. This is part of the Hilton Hawaiian Village and is right on the same property. A nice lobby but a long walk to the elevators. On their website the map shows the property across Ala Moana Blvd but it isn't. I'm glad that someone wrote about the lounge chairs at the Paradise pool that are turned around toward the lagoon - they were great. Be sure to try the Wailuna Coffee Shop across the street. Walk out through the HHV shopping area, past Benihana, to the street and turn left. The coffee shop is straight ahead across Ala Moana Blvd. We tried to get there from our hotel's back door but it wasn't a good way. The ABC store on the property has everything you need, even wine. Beautiful grounds with lots of lawn area. Starbucks. Be sure to get cookies at the Cookie Store. Delicious.

Able to stop by Costco which is close by the air port to pick up snacks, water, etc. Save few $$ by eating breakfast and lunch in room with microwave, toaster, etc. Try to visit North shore, Shark cove for snorkling, Giovanni shrimp truck, and definitely Kailua Beach Park (has bathroom, showers, life guards) and nearby Lanikai Beach.

They have an excellent weight room that allows you to target every muscle group plus they have yoga classes, Zumba classes, Hip Hop classes, and body sculpt classes.) There are no fitness classes at Hilton Hawaiian Village. We took the Lei Making class and the Hula Dance class. Both were fun! We witnessed the penguin feeding time, but couldn't hear what the trainer was saying. I wished she would have been wearing a microphone so that we could hear about the 7 penquins and what they look for when they are feeding them, etc. Too many little kids surrounding the penguins. Great shopping on the hotel grounds! I loved selecting the oyster and getting not one, but two pearls at the Maui Divers Jewelry store for $14.95. Then you can have it mounted if you like. This was my favorite souvenir from Hawaii.The beach was beautiful. We took surf lessons at the hotel. I never knew how much upper body strength it takes to surf! But, true to their word, the four of us (ages 48, 49, 21, and 18) stood up and surfed.We attended the Luau on Thursday night. We paid extra for the premier seating. They tell you that if you have little kids it is better closer than farther. Since we are all adults, that was not a concern. We still chose the premier seating and it pays off when it is time to go up to the buffet line. The tables are called up and they start with premier seating. Plus, the premier seating gets a flower and a coral lei. We thought going early to eat was worth the extra $20/person. The food was good. The dessert was so-so. The entertainment was great! The drink guys worked incredibly hard.We also attended the dinner starlight cruise with fireworks viewing from the catamaran boat. We dressed up, and wished we had worn jeans or casual clothes.

This is by far the best hotel in Waikiki for families with young children.","Los Angeles, California","havekidwilltravel2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",40,5.0

For $1,200 plus 2 hours of our time one afternoon for a timeshare sales pitch we got 6 nights in a city view 1 bedroom condo in the Grand Waikikian Tower, plus free mid-size car rental and a $200 certificate toward a future Hilton stay. I'll talk about the marketing package at the end of the review.The room was nice, spacious, and comfortable. I was very excited that our city view balcony had an ocean view from one side- we were on the 28th floor in an end room (2811). However, it was very windy on the balcony when the trade winds were blowing and there was lots of street noise (even from the 28th floor), so we didn't spend much time out there. In fact, we spent very little time in the room overall, but the elevators were fast, the room was clean, the bathroom spacious, the shower pressure good, the bed firm but comfortable, the bedding and towels nice, and the kitchen, though we didn't end up using it, was very nice and seemed to have what you would need. As it is a timeshare you only get housekeeping 1x during your stay, but if you need anything in between you can request it. It was also nice to have a washer and dryer. Yes, the resort is enormous - it is truly a village. If you don’t care to walk don’t stay here. Amazingly while it accommodates 5,000 people and has 1,800 staff, it never felt crowded. The grounds are amazingly gorgeous with winding paths, ponds, waterfalls, koi, flamingos, penguins, swans, and gardens. You will do a lot of walking on concrete both on the resort and exploring Waikiki - I ended up going to the Ala Moana Center to buy some sandals with better support as my feet were throbbing by day 2 from my cute sandals. Bring some comfortable (but still cute!) sandals with a good sole.The pools are very nice. We started at the super pool the first day, as I thought the paradise pool would have too much noise since it's the fun pool for kids. Unfortunately the super pool doesn't have an ocean view, so I wasn't overly excited about it. Here's my #1 review tip if you don't have kids and a pool chair with a good view is important to you: the back row of pool chairs at the paradise pool are turned around to face the lagoon and the Pacific beyond. They're easy to get as most people have kids and need to be closer to the pool (we got them any time we wanted, even arriving early afternoon), the view of the lagoon and ocean is beautiful, and the noise from the pool wasn't bad (and I don't like noise). Plus, two out of the six days a kid puked in the pool, which requires them to shut it down for a few hours or the rest of the day. Gross, yes, but with a great side-benefit for us: suddenly all the kids and their parents exit for the other pools, and you're left with a great view and absolute peace and quiet - and you still have the lagoon steps away to cool off in! Another tip - they give you bracelets to wear when at the pool when you check in - don't worry about it (put them in your bag) - no one wears them and we never got asked. And be sure to go down the bigger waterslide – it was surprisingly fun!Waikiki Beach is beautiful. We didn’t sit on the beach, but we walked it every morning and several times during the day. It gets very busy as the day goes on but the beach in front of the Hilton is wide and isn’t crowded like the Diamond Head end of the beach. I didn’t think I’d like the Hilton’s lagoon but I loved it. It’s beautiful and fun to walk around and swim in. There’s also a nice wide concrete path (the beachwalk) from the Hilton to down past the Sheraton.We ate and/or had cocktails at Tropics several times, got sandwiches from Pronto Pickle, hot dogs from the little place at the base of the rainbow tower, and had Kona coffee and pastries from Lappert's coffee shop each morning. Yes they are all expensive, but so is almost everything in Waikiki. We had great burgers next door at the Hale Koa Military hotel (cafeteria style ordering then take your tray out to the bar/patio tables on the beach - you don't have to be military to eat there) and that is much cheaper - $18 for two burgers, fries, and cokes. A gallon of water for your room is $4.99 at the Accents gift shop in the GW tower, which I noted was only 50 cents more than the ABC store at the mall. Overall, expect to pay $8.50/beer, $10/cocktail, $15-$18 for an appetizer or sandwich, and $25-$35 for an entree - at the Hilton or most places in Waikiki. One recommendation is Tiki's at the other end of Waikiki for their Calamari Katsu appetizer - it is amazing. Rum Fire at the Sharaton also had a great atmosphere mid-evening for tapas.One thing I have to rave about is the service on check-out day. Checkout is at 11, but you can still use all of the hotel amenities for the rest of the day (your key still works to get into the pool area, you can get towels, etc). As a guest of HVC you can use the spacious concierge area of the GW Tower until 5 pm. It has painfully slow Internet, light refreshments, lots of sitting areas, and showers. We had an 11 pm flight, so we packed our bags, put them in the car, then sat by the pool all day. We didn’t want to shower by 5, so instead of the concierge room we used one of the hotel’s hospitality rooms. You can make a reservation for one at the main hotel front desk, and at your reserved time they will give you a key to a regular hotel room that you can use for 20 minutes per adult (I’m not sure what they do if you have kids). This was FANTASTIC – if it weren’t for this (or the concierge room) we wouldn’t have sat by the pool the last day – who wants to fly home covered in sunscreen and salt? The only minor frustration we had was right when we arrived. The signage at the Hilton is understated and tasteful so we had a hard time finding where to go once we were in the resort. We pulled up to the GW front desk after we finally found it, got checked in, then made our way back to the parking ramp – not really ever sure that we were in the right place. Once we got parked we had no idea how to get back to the GW tower from within the ramp - there's no signage in the ramp at all. If you're staying in the GW Tower go to level two on the opposite side of ramp from the elevators to a small section that seems like private parking with a shiny floor - a small almost unmarked door within that section will take you to into the GW tower. It's probably a staff entrance, but it's the only easy way back to the tower we found the whole week! Also, parking is $24 a day (which is probably why they give you the free rental car!), and some reviews recommend parking at the Hale Koa. It’s a long walk – spend the extra $8 per day.Some other random tips: Get an air mattress for $3.50 (includes inflating) at the ABC store and float in the lagoon. On your last day offer it to someone else. Venture out of Waikiki! Kayaking in Kailua was our highlight, and even if kayaking doesn't interest you go over there and spend some time on the beach to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Bring your GPS or rent one with your car - signage is HORRIBLE if it even exists and streets change names constantly. Even if you don't want to hike it, go to base of Diamond Head - there's a little cart that sells fresh pineapple spears for $3.00 a bag. It's wonderful and you can eat them right out of the baggie without getting sticky. If you venture toward Waianae stop at the Marriott in Ko'Olina for lunch - their beach restaurant overlooks the beautiful beach and lagoon and my husband is still raving about the fish tacos. (The Marriott itself was beautiful too if you’re looking for a nice place to stay out of Waikiki). If you're driving to the North Shore stop quick at the Dole Plantation to get a pineapple carving knife for $6 (works wonderfully) and try a dish of the Dole Whip (pineapple soft serve). It's right off the highway and is actually pretty cool. Also, “Oahu Revealed” is a GREAT guidebook written by locals. I’ve used it and the Maui one three times now and wouldn’t go without it.Be prepared when you go to Waikiki that it’s a major city. There are people everywhere, lots of street noise, heavy traffic, sirens, airplanes overhead, lines for restaurants, etc. If you are looking for peace and quiet go somewhere else – another part of the island or to another island altogether. The street noise does not extend to the pools or the beach, though there are people everywhere (again, without feeling crowded). In exchange you get a vibrant area to explore with tons of restaurant, shopping, and activity choices within walking distance. It’s also beautifully done – tiki torches light the beachwalk and restaurant patios at night, there are abundant gardens, trees, and parks , and the sea green ocean is breathtaking. Know what you’re going for - if you envision a week of absolute peace and quiet you are likely going to be disappointed.One final discussion about the “marketing package” as I was a bit nervous about it. It went without a hitch. I booked our April week in August after finding a good flight deal – the booking was easy. Our concierge called us the week before departure to confirm the details of our trip. Our car rental was easy to get. Check in was painless. We had a meeting with our concierge the first day we were there which I was sure would be another sales pitch – it wasn’t. She gave us some good tips (and some trinkets) and was fun to talk to – and didn’t try to sell us a thing. One note – the folder they give you with info on the island/resort has your $200 Spend a Night on Us certificate in it – don’t throw it away with the folder before you leave like I did.  The 2-hour sales pitch was not bad. I was actually interested in what they had to offer and considered it. If you think it may be for you research it before you go – if you’re going to buy you have to buy while you’re there and of course they give you extras/deals that you can only get if you sign while you’re sitting in the meeting. Also consider your financing before you go and know that it’s not just something you can generally go back to your bank and get a loan for as there’s really no collateral (I’m a banker). For the presentation your sales rep walks you through the program (it’s a points program), asks you a bunch of questions about your travel style, shows you a movie, answers your questions, etc. It’s a sales pitch but it’s not high pressure. If you say no her boss has to come in and offer a few more incentives. If you still say no they get a little short with you, but oh well. Be on your way and enjoy the rest of your week! It was well worth the value of the vacation deal.","Two Harbors, MN","C&amp;CCav</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Two Harbors, MN</strong>",125,4.0

We stayed in a 2BR penthouse suite in the Grand Waikikian while in Oahu. Our group was 2 couples, so the suite was a great choice. We both had our own bedroom and bath. We had room # 3611. Overall, the suite was very large with high-end finishings and furnishings. A very large LR with a balcony with ocean views, a DR area with round table. Kitchen with granite countertops and stainless steel appliances (would have been great if I wanted to spend my vacation cooking!) The master bedroom was very spacious with a balcony the full length of the room and bath. Our room had a great view of Diamondhead. The bathroom had a glass shower, toilet room and large whirlpool bath. There is a hallway with closet and washer/dryer combo. (Note: the washer & dryer take a LONG time to do a load. Not sure why, but allow 2 hours for each/load.) There is a door to separate the 2nd bedroom area. The bath is in the hall and also has a large whirlpool tub and glass shower. The 2nd bedroom has a queen bed and full length glass windows along both walls of the corner. The best thing about being in the penthouse is the penthouse lounge only for penthouse rooms. They have continental breakfast in the morning and happy hour in the evening. The suite personnel are wonderful and had great suggestions of where to go and what to do. It takes a lot of HGVC points for the penthouse, but if you figure in the savings for breakfast/appetizers/drinks it isn't too bad. We felt it was well worth the splurge! The Hilton property is very large and there is a lot of walking, but doable. There are two beaches and a couple pools. I preferred the ""real"" beach as opposed to the lagoon area. Be advised, if you want an umbrella and chair on the beach you need to pay for it. The chairs are $15.71, not sure about the umbrellas. We saw a lot of people who had gone to Costco or Walmart and gotten chairs and groceries. A good option if you are there for a more than a few days. The shops and restaurants at the Hilton are all typical resort type. We only ate in one restaurant, Tropics. It was fine, but overpriced for the quality. Not unexpected, but we were tired and didn't want to venture out. The number one suggestion I have is to get out of the Waikiki area and travel around the island. A drive around Diamondhead and up to the Northshore will let you see how beautiful the island is. Go to Chinatown and have some great, inexpensive food. One of our favorite experiences was ""The Hole in the Wall"" tour. A great tour of the food of Honolulu. Read reviews and go...you won't be disappointed! I also want to mention the fireworks every Friday by Hilton. This was an unexpected surprise. We watched from our balcony and they were really great! We were told it is done every Friday unless the weather prohits it. We loved our time in Oahu and can't wait to return!","Danbury, Connecticut","MrsBerry</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Danbury, Connecticut</strong>",91,5.0

I have traveled around the world and thes were definitely great accomodations. We had a 2 bedroom condo. It was not the biggest condo we ever had but it was spacious enough for my 2 nine year old boys to sleep on the pulluout couch and my daughter and mother to take the 2 full beds in one bedroom and my wife to take the king in the tohter room. The attention to detail that was mostly consisten in this tower was pretty impressive. It generally used quality materials and wen beyond mere trim to make more of a statement. The one exception I noticed was the base trim in our condo looked to be plastic because the paint was pealing in off in two different rooms. Overall this was a great vacation. The first day I went to costco to stock up. Costco is about 3 miles away. The second day I went to the Safeway to get the rest of the food. We went to Roys which was authentic Hawaiian cuisine it was ok then we walked down the strip. Second day did Duke's which was ok food. I would highly recommend that to fully experience Oahu you need to go native. Go see Lahai beach and Waimalea great boogie boarding and in car both are less than a 45 minute trip. Pack a picnic lunch. Only draw back to the condo was its location. It was at the west end of the Waikiki so it was not close to a lot of the action and the waves were pretty tame. By the way the room also had a PS3 in the room so the kids had a lot of fun.,"Downers Grove, Illinois","billcat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Downers Grove, Illinois</strong>",25,4.0

The 2 bd, 2 bth was large, modern, clean and great to run back up from the beach to make a meal. Ala Moana shopping center was close by for groceries - it was great not to have to pay $$$ for each meal, we could cook and eat whatever we wanted.

After spending the previous week in a small cabin cruising around the islands, the idea of the space in a 1 BR was most welcomed. We took Roberts from the pier and the large bus cannot drop you off at the GW. They drop you off at the Tapa bus depot and you have to schlep over to the GW but they will store your luggage for you there and deliver it to your room later. (The Tapa bus depot is also where you will pick up any tours you take.)Arrival: After arriving at about 10:30 we spent the day exploring the grounds since room-ready is not until 4:00. As others have said, the place is huge. It was a bit overwhelming that first day, but by day three we knew our way around, were taking shortcuts and it wasn't that bad. We ate lunch at CJ's and while it was very good, it came to $49 for two sandwiches with a ton of fries each, a soda and a beer, not exactly worth 50 bucks. Walked over to Hale Koa next door to pick up tickets and saw hamburgers for $4, cocktails for $7, etc., a much better value, although we never did eat there. Sat in the lobby for about an hour and they gave out fruit punch to people coming and going. (Saturday was the only day I saw this.) We got the room-ready call at 3:20, Room 1611. The elevators are now marked, so no problem getting to our room. The rooms: The hotel has 39 floors, and you need a key to access penthouse floors 35-39. From the outside you can see 5 balconies on Ala Moana Blvd,, 5 facing the ocean with little or no view because there is another tower right in front of them, and one balcony on each side of the building. Because ours was a trade-in, our room was city-view. Our balcony was on the left side of the building, about 25 feet long, with no balcony neighbors. The rooms were large, in perfect condition, and sparkling clean. The TV in the living room had a DVD player and game playing controls. In the lobby, there were free video rental kiosks, you just needed to get a card from the check-in counter. It was great to have a washer and dryer right in the room, not huge capacity but okay, and yes, the dryer did take forever, but when you turned it on it did say '1 hour 57 minutes, 2 hours 2 minutes, etc.' Trash and towel service was on Tuesday but for some reason we got extra towels on Sunday so we had plenty for the week with washing them. (Only use 2 teaspoons of laundry detergent in the washer.) They supply you with the detergent and when I needed more I just asked the housekeeper in the hall and was given extra with a smile. There is a guest services hotline and they were pleasant and accommodating both times we called with questions.  If you are a light sleeper and get city-view, you really want a room higher than floor 16. I was told the rooms were assigned on Thursday for Saturday check-in. The hotel is on the main street, between two traffic lights. There is constant traffic noise, not really loud but definitely not silent, especially when the buses and trucks accelerate as the light turns green, although after a few days, we didn't notice it anymore.We did not go to the concierge within 24 hours of check-in because we didn't want to be bothered by the timeshare pitch so we didn't get the HGVC tote that people were carrying around (It looked like a reusable grocery bag, but thinner,), nor did we get our blue 'experience' card activated. On the card in the room it said ""weeks from $10,000 to $278,700."" WOW!Food/dining: We ate breakfast in the room every day as we are not big breakfast eaters. The only dinner we ate on site was the last night because it was raining, so we went to Benihana's. At 5:30 there was no wait. (We saw loads of people waiting outside all week.) It was $84 for 2 Surf and Turfs, and 1 soda, similar in pricing to Kobe Steak House next door where we also ate. I found a grocery store about two blocks away, Food Pantry. It was a decent size with six to eight aisles and had anything you would need from eggs to steak, a deli section a produce section, etc. Prices were Hawaii prices, the biggest shock being milk at $4.09 a QUART, but it was nice to be able to get anything you wanted. (You cross the street, keep the Coffee House on your left, go to the next block and cross the street, make a left and it is halway up the block. Cross at the crosswalks. Jaywalking is against the law and you can get a ticket for over $100.)On property: The pools with slides were always crowded, but the ones without were not. The sand on the beach was very coarse. Beach rentals at HHV were very high, $42 an hour for the pedal floats. We did not rent the chairs/umbrella so no idea of the current price.The Honolulu Cookie Co. on property had the most delicious cookies. I bought 7 boxes to bring home. Only 5 of them made it back. Le Sportsac had two exclusive Hawaiian prints on a large selection of bags so I bought some for gifts. There were lots of jewelry stores, none of which ever looked busy, and of course 'there was a Pick a Pearl Factory.'. Also, there were some nice clothing stores like Tori Richard and Blue Ginger but I couldn't see spending $189 on a long sundress, although it sure was beautiful.More my speed/price range was the ABC store right in the Rainbow Bazaar. It was always crowded, but it was a nice size, lots of cheap souvenirs, postcards, T-shirts, etc. If you take the garage elevator, there is also an ABC store outside to the right, smaller, but a lot less crowded. We went to both often. Also, Lappert's ice cream in the Rainbow Bazaar was great.The business center on property has a post office substation. We sent two prepaid boxes home. They only take cash or traveler's check, so be prepared. I heard someone say they needed to connect to the internet and print seven pages. She was told it's a 15 minute minimum at $.50 per minute and a dollar a page. (I believe the internet is free at the GW, but there are six other towers so maybe she was from a different one.) The concierge will print your boarding passes for free. They also had a photo center there w/one machine like at the drugstores. I had 13 pictures printed out and a CD ($8.50) made for $13.26. You could not pick it up until the next day, but everything came out fine.Off-site: The walk to the main part of downtown by the International Marketplace is about 15-20 minutes. We took the bus twice and walked twice. If you are 65+ or have a Medicare card, the bus is only $1.We ate dinners off-site because we felt the on-site reviews were mixed and prices were high for a mixed review - Dinners at Roy's, Duke's, Kobe, Magic Show w/buffet at Hale Koa. Lunches at Orchid's Sunday brunch, Lobster tails for $28 at Blue Water twice, sandwiches in the room a couples of times, and the Shorebird w/$3.50 Mai Tais.Departure: There is a hospitality lounge available to you on check-out day for freshening up. You call the day before and pick a time and they give you 20 minutes per person. Ours was a regular room in the Diamond Head Tower. Since we could never both take a shower and get ready in 40 minutes, we just used it to change into traveling clothes. It was a nice touch. Overall: We absolutely loved the GW and would definitely return! We found everyone we came in contact with at the hotel to be very helpful and pleasant. We particularly loved Randy at the Tapa bus depot. What a nice guy! Prices were high on property, but prices in Hawaii in general are high. We loved the newness of the rooms in the GW and all the amenities available on property.

This is HHV's newest tower (timeshare) and everything was in excellent condition. The good: The Hilton Hawaiian Village is huge and has everything you could possibly need/want right inside the resort complex. Pools, restaurants, bars, luau, shops, fitness center, spa, beach, gardens, etc. Our unit was beautifully appointed with a full kitchen, washer/dryer, two spacious marble bathrooms, flat screen TV's with DVD player, highspeed internet access, and they just installed Sony Playstations while we were there - with free games (one at a time). The staff was very professional and there was absolutely no pressure to attend a timeshare tour, thank goodness!The not so good: We had a 2BR unit on the 10th floor, overlooking Ala Moana Blvd, which is VERY noisy all day/evening, making the lanai almost useless to us. Since we didn't spend a whole lot of time in our unit, it wasn't that big a deal - and we are not owners, so we didn't expect a great view. Also, for us, the beds were not all that comfortable (the mattresses were very firm, we prefer Westin's ""Heavenly Beds"") and the A/C didn't cool the master bedroom as well as the rest of the unit. At the lowest setting (68F), the other rooms were downright chilly, but the master bedroom was still warm. It would've been nice to open the door to the lanai to let breezes blow in, but the street noise was simply too loud. These were all pretty minor issues compared to the positives.Note: If you are more accustomed to resorts with ""super pools"" be aware that the pools at HHV are on the small side. There is one children's pool with a couple of slides, and it was always jam-packed with families!

We received a special rate for sitting through their vacation club sales pitch, but we felt it was well worth the deal we received - and we actually considered buying. Our room was on the 25th floor and our view was wonderful. Yes, there is the Lagoon Tower obstructing part of the view, but we could still see lots of ocean and watch the surfers every morning from either balcony. The only other island we have visited in Hawaii is Lanai. We've been there twice in the past couple of years and have stayed at both Four Seasons properties there, as well as in one of the Four Seasons villas. This, of course, was a different experience, but we knew that going in. Honolulu is a big city. There is traffic and noise and homeless people and high-rise buildings everywhere. Everyone needs to understand this before planning a vacation in Honolulu, but this has nothing to do with the Grand Waikikian. We found the property to be quiet. We never once heard our neighbors, and yet we knew they were there just from running into them in the hallway on occassion. Yes, they certainly accommodate Asian travelers, but I do believe Honolulu is closer to Tokyo than it is to Washington D.C., so why wouldn't they? It's not like we didn't feel just as welcome, and I really enjoy vacationing with people from all over the world. We found everyone to be very friendly - both the staff and the fellow vacationers. As others have said, the rooms are nice. The lobby is lovely. And, the grounds were prettier than I had expected. I have no complaints about the property, but again, I knew it was going to be big and not a quaint intimate resort when we made our travel plans. Oh, and it is a resort and it is in Hawaii, so drinks and food will be expensive - there's no getting around that. We enjoyed happy hour at Tropics twice and ate and drank there for less than we would at home, so it's not all too bad. We also thought the on-site pizza restaurant was pretty good one night when we didn't feel like going out, and again no more expensive than in Chicago.We went to Pearl Harbor, which we were all very glad we did. We also headed to the North Shore one day, stopping at Dole Plantation on the way. It was a nice place to stop and stretch our legs. We ate at Giovanni's shrimp truck in Haliewa, which was delicious as well as a fun experience. We followed the coast around the island and stopped to play on the beach in Kailua late in the afternoon. That is a beautiful beach with warm water and powder white sand. It was a great beach for my young daughter to get in the water and play in the sand.I think the Grand Waikikian is a great place to stay for a family. We all had fun and enjoyed the property, from my 1 year old daughter to my 67 year old mother and father in laws. I don't quite understand all of the complaints, and I would certainly consider my husband and myself to be pretty picky travelers when it comes to our accommodations.","Wheaton, Illinois","lovetotravelChicago</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wheaton, Illinois</strong>",70,5.0

If you are a member and you stay here, you get more perks. member advantages: free to use fitness center. otherwise I want to say $12 or $20 a day. I forget which. Use of hospitality lounge on the 8th floor. They have tv, refreshments, pastries, showers, lockers and toiletries so you can use them prior to check in or after check out. you get nicknacks like eco bags and scratch off gifts. Also, they have their own activities like hula lessons and lei making. Lei making at the resort is $10 a person. here it is free! Also, you get a preferred shopper's card that gives you free cookies at honolulu cookie company, discounts at restaurants on site, etc. location: closest to the parking garage, there is actually a garage elevator or you can walk so it is very convenient if you have a car. All other buildings including the regular hotel rooms will require a walk.GW is off of Ala Moana Blvd so if you have a room on the lower level, you can hear street noise. We had partial ocean as well as street view but while we were there, there was a parade so it was great! Also, if you walk the blvd side, it is a short walk to the Kalia tower where the fitness center is located.Close to the new paradise pool with slides. Kids have to be 5 yrs old for the bigger slides but the smaller one can be used as long as they are 3ft tall and they were a flotation device. Wings or vestSuites/lobby: very beautiful with dark wood decor. you can tell the difference if you've stayed at the other towers or hotel portion. Full kitchen with ss and high end appliances. Again, you'll see the difference if you stay at the lagoon tower. The suites are smaller than the lagoon tower, but it has hardwood flrs throughout, stand alone shower and separate soaking tub. Washer/Dryer is in suite for free.I honestly don't know why some people are leaving bad reviews. Maybe it has to do with time of vacation? ppl compained about long lines at the slides, there were none. Lack of service, okay if you went while they are on strike, that's another issue. These are condo type suites so you can't expect daily maid service like the hotel rooms, etc.We might just be easy to please, but we had a great time!","Birmingham, Michigan","ohana_kauai</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, Michigan</strong>",77,5.0

Housekeeping service was skipped on one day of our stay until we called to request it when it was clear that it wasn't happening; instead of an apology, the management insisted that we must have had our ""privacy"" card on the door (which was impossible since it was broken and couldn't have been hung on the door if we had wanted to). There are a number of concierge personnel, but each one we spoke with knew less than the one before regarding local sightseeing and dining options. Note that the location of the property is at the far western end of Waikiki, a fifteen minute walk from most of the shopping and dining. Also note that the Hilton Hawaiian Village can be a frenetic and claustrophobic place, so it is far from a relaxing getaway. The too-small fitness center is located in a different building in the complex, and getting there is an ordeal. While the rooms are fine, all else about the Grand Waikikian fails and it should be avoided in favor of the much better (and better located) full service hotels in the heart of Waikiki.",Chicago,"LXR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago</strong>",36,1.0

We have always stayed at the Ali'i Tower in the past. due to the special amenities that were once offered. Unfortunately, the Ali'i Tower's service and very wonderful staff have been replaced. As an example, continental breakfast is no longer offered on the pool deck floor by such wonderful staff as Mei-Ling, the evening pupus are no more (this was a wonderful time at the end of the day to chat with other guests). In summary the Ali'i Tower seemed to lose its charm. However, our extended family thought we would visit this one last time.....with some trepidation because of reported bed bug incidents and the mishandling (see TA reviews) of the guests' concerns. As a result, I began checking other hotels and rates that might accomodate us for our stay. THe Hilton Grand Waikikian seemed to be running a ""sell-off: rate of POV 2 bedroom at $474 or an OV at $554 per night. ( Please do not quote me exactly on these figures....) But obviously, these were discounted rates perhaps due to low hotel occupancy. We booked a 2-bedroom and my parents reserved a 1- bedroom. Aurevoir Ali'I! Bonjour GW.Our stay was booked from Dec. 18-26....here are my thoughts!ARRIVAL:The GW has a lovely portico lobby for the arrival and departure of its guests. We were greeted by smiling bellmen, who were only too happy to assist us. The lobby was inviting with festive trees welcoming us to our Christmas Holiday! We walked over to the Hilton HHonors guest line and were quickly checked in by a very gracious and efficient front desk staff (I wish I could remember her name.) Not even 10 minutes later, we were in our OV room (2907...I think). THe 07 suite had an extended balcony that some of the other suites did not possess. We had requested 2 beds in the second bedroom to accomodate our 2 children. Our intial impression of the suite was that it was meticulously clean, well laid out, and deluxe (not over the top luxurious as the flooring was a look-a-like wood (vinyl) and not real hardwood. However, I was happy with our choice over the Ali'i Tower, as we now had a kitchen in addition to the 2 bedrooms. (Please don't misunderstand...I did not make dinner even once, but we had lovely breakfasts every morning on our lanai. The kitchen did its job, by providing an area to store snacks and breakfast offerings. With 2 growing teenagers, it was certainly nice to have some healthy food on hand. :) SUITES:As mentioned, previously, everything was clean and well appointed. The stacking washer/dryer came in handy for rinsing out swimsuits, etc. (I did not experience any difficulty with the dryer as other posters have noted.) Kitcehn came equipped with all the necessities including a blender for those frou-frou drinks enjoyed on the lanai and a steamer that would assist in Asian meal preparation. The living room area was on the small side but certainl.y very functional. There were 3 flat screen TV's in all.....so no fighting for a TV......we hardly even used 1 TV! The Master bedroom had an open concept bathroom with a soaking tub and a separate shower and 2 sinks. Thirsty clean towels were abundant. There was also a slider glass door that opened onto the extended lanai. (It did not seem that all suites had this large of a balcony...)The second bedroom just had a window (good if you have small children). This bedroom also had its own bathroom accessible by the bedroom or off the main living area. Clean, well appointed bathroom with one shower and 2 sinks (no Tub). All in all, a very functional and cute set-up for our 8 night stay.RESORT GROUNDS:Okay, so we have ""been there done that"" on many previous occasions. However, we had not tried the new pool by the GW and Lagoon Tower. Much smaller (and warmer) than the SUperPool, but obviously a pool geared to families with younger children. No worries, we used the loungers that faced the lagoon for relaxation while our kids enjoyed the Lagoon toys. The HHV does have beautiful albeit somewhat urban grounds. Compared to other hotels in Waikiki, this is positively an oasis. RESTAURANTS:DO NOT EAT AT THE HHV! I REPEAT...DO NOT EAT AT THE HHV (EXCEPT FOR Lapperts) Whoah, every year we expect the restaurants to improve, and every year we are again disappointed.BALI : Run away. WE reserved the Christmas Eve Dinner @ 75.00 pp. A set menu that looked interesting. On the restaurants defense, we requested and were given a wonderful sea side table.....and the salads were excellant....but sadly, this is where it declined. The lobster bisque..OKAY.And then the entrees There were 3 or 4 choices. Vegetarian, risotto, steak, chcken and a fish. The chicken entree was served on a tomato risotto. (think brined chicken with loose hanging skin appendages ""on top"" of a tomato soup infused cold risotto. Think again, Bali, my Mother, daughter and I were disgusted with this offering. My Father and son had ordered the steak....definitely more palatable but certainly nothing exciting....served warm, not Hot! My husband had the fish.Overdone and lukewarm. WOW.. not good, not good at all. Dessert was again Okay. In summary, our servers did their best, comped 3 glasses of wine (big deal). and P.S. we did not eat our chicken...we were asked if we wanted one of the other ""PRE-MADE"" entrees. We declined and went to Lapperts for some ice cream and coffee. Dear Readers, save your money....AVOID. ( Incidently, 2 years previous at Christmas Eve we had reserved the Christmas EVe buffet at the Rainbow with extended family and friends (this was done prior to departure 3 weeks in advance.) We were not given any notice that this buffet was cancelled at any time. However, upon confirming this reservation 2 days prior to our dining time, the restaurant let me know that they were not offering the buffet, Whoah, again, really Hilton!! We ate at their now defunct steakhouse which was the only place that could accomodate us at short notice. This was worse than horrible...I believe it is now closed. :)Tropics. Actually did not eat here. We tried but we were very off-put by the attitude of the hostess. We were looking for a table for 3 just have the lunch crowd rush. We were happy to sit anywhere. Lots of clean, available tables......But impolitely given a pager and told ""we will call you!"" Really, really. This is not a Michelin star restaurant and certainly not the only place on Waikiki beach. Check the attitude ( for the record, we were very polite). No thank, you. HHV ..fool me once (think Bali).........WE declined their silly wait time and then suddenly as we were departing.....""Wait, I think we have a table!"" . No way.......Well, Dear REaders, if you are still with me, I can recommend some excellant restaurant choices. Check out Sorrentos on top of the Ilikai, (THis restaurnat shares the same owners as Sorrento'ss on the Beach and Nic's Fish Market in Maui...amazing restaurants, incidently) for an amazing view, wonderful wait staff, incredible food and still less $ than Bali. I wish we would have discovered it sooner. Absolutely fantastic.Also, check out Roy's. Excellant fish. Surroundings not anything to write home about. Great waiters and service.For casual eats; Keo's ..good thai food at Ok prices, gaudy decor, slow service.Bubba' Gumps....you know what you get.....great shrimp, fast service.California Pizza Kitchen.....again great food, busy atmosphere.CONCLUSION:Our family is very well travelled. We enjoy luxe vacations. WE are not particulary enamoured of Waikiki having visited the other islands many other times. However, that was the locale for a family and friend celebration. IF I WERE TO RETURN TO WAIKIKI,I would not hesitate to stay at the GW if I came with my children. The staff (doormen, front desk, maids) were all very friendly and helpful. The building itself had a beautiful foyer and corridors. And yes, there were a lot of Asians....but who cares. They were very well mannered and visiting with their families just as we were. I never once felt that we were being overlooked in service because we were Norh American. Yes, it was busy....but we recongize that prior to travel.We had a memorable vacation with the exception of the HHV dining experiences. I am giving the GW an ""Excellant"" TA review, because for what we were expecting, this property delivered. But, just to be aware, it is not a ""pampering, luxiourious kind of resort."" For this reason, I will give it the ""5 dots"" because I received what I was expecting. At the end of the day, whether I stay at a 3 star or a 5 star property, I just want to achieve what I would expect for that type of establishment. Again, just my $.02.

We were dressed well and arrived on time with patient children and very few bags- not quite sure what the problem was. I did however learn the meaning of 'mahalo'- Staff can be rude to you if they end every sentence with 'Mahalo'. They can also shoot dirty looks at you when you ask why your ocean view room in the lagoon tower has been moved to a tower off of the beach as long as they follow it with a 'mahalo'. It seems that booking through travel sites means the Grand Waikikian will try very hard not to honor your booking. We were finally moved to a better suite although not in the original tower which helped but did not live up to the expectations or the cost of 'beach views from all sides and being directly on the beach. We arrived to a room which despite the luxurious decor was filthy. The walls had black marks all over them as if it had just been used as a storage room for rubber tires, the artwork had spray marks from someones party all over it and the floors had clearly not been washed.we stayed there for 10 days and this did not change before we left. To be fair (and VERY THANKFUL) the bellman were incredibly friendly and always had a smile. As for the hotel encouraging you to spend your first few minutes with the concierge don't bother. It is a time share push and they bait you with a hotel discount card that surprise, surprise was not accepted anywhere we went! Yippee! From what I can tell the hotel believes the amenities were so great, service was notrequired. They were wrong. For our first trip to Hawaii we were excited for the welcoming 'Aloha Spirit '. For our first stay we were excited for the luxury and service. To our credit we didn't let them get us down and they will NEVER get us back. AT $950 a night I am sure we can find accomodations closer to the heart of the city with better access to the beach and better room service!

We were offered the opportunity to visit the new tower of the Hilton Hawaiian Village, the Grand Waikikian. SInce we had two major life celebrations, husband's birthday and 30th wedding anniversary we chose to visit the third week of September 2010. We received access to a Ford Escape which was a wonderful car through Dollar rent a car and arrived at the Hotel from a 6 hour flight from LA tired but hopeful. We were placed in a room on the 5th floor facing the street and were advised that no other rooms were available. It was a one bedroom, slightly smaller than the Vegas Strip property, and frankly not as well appointed. Minimal use of granite and stainless, functional and clean, with heavy pieces of ""Hawaiian"" style wooden furniture. The tub while deep was NOT a jacuzzi tub. We learned later during our sales presentation that the only jacuzzi tubs were in the penthouse properties on the 34th plus floors. Our 'view' was of the main street with of course the constant din of city traffic. We're pretty easy going folks so we were comfortable, although if you're going to try and impress an Owner to purchase more points or a piece of a property, not a good location. As they say in real estate, Location, Location, Location! We have to commend the young woman RACHEL who was our assigned personal conciege during our visit. She took the time to call us before our trip, ask about our interests and if we were celebrating any events (a birthday and anniversary) and frankly was so personally CHARMING that we ended up 'hugging' friends by the end of our stay. Hilton needs more people like RACHEL working on the public facing end. She rescheduled our sales presentation to accommodate our schedules and even tried to locate tours we expressed an interest in. Speaking of the sales presentation, we met with our sales rep at the appointed time AND WE WERE KEPT COOLING OUR HEELS almost 20 minutes in the Sales Office Lobby until we were met by TERRY, who was COMPLETELY UNPREPARED FOR OUR VISIT. He knew nothing about us, hadn't done his research and began the presentation asking us, ""DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?"". We asked a few questions and for a tour of the upper floors which we were graciously shown. Certainly spectacular views up there on the 37th floor, but for the $300,000 to purchase enough points to stay there for a week I didn't see the value. Unfortunately for Terry both my self and my husband have been in customer oriented industries for over 30 years. My husband in particular has been in real estate finance since the mid 80's. WE NEVER MEET WITH CLIENTS WITHOUT FIRST KNOWING WHO WE ARE MEETING, AND HAVING A GOAL AND OBJECTIVE FOR THE MEETING. Perhaps it was because the meeting was a reschedule, but as TERRY shuffled through our papers with Hilton we were struck by the fact that this sale WAS NOT going to happen. Once TERRY realized that we were NOT buying any more points (by the way $28,000 for 5K more AT that property, which by the way WAS NOT available), we were summarily, but courteously SHOWN THE DOOR. Fine with us, but startling none the less. Be advised that if you're given the $100 Hilton Dollars to use on property you'll be given conflicting information based upon where you try to cash them in. One restaurant on property REFUSED to take them for alcohol, fifteen feet away a second property restaurant took them for drinks WITHOUT QUESTION. Finally, be advised that Valet parking WHICH YOU CAN'T USE YOUR HILTON DOLLARS FOR is $30 a day. Self parkting is $26. And, you'll wait upwards of 15 minutes for your car when you call for it.

I was willing to spend the extra money to stay at a really nice resort. We rented a 2-bedroom, 2-bath suite with a full ocean view for $689 per night plus taxes. When we checked in the front desk lady was very nice but warned us about the housekeeping. She said if we put our ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on or if for any reason we sent the house cleaning away, they would not come back. So, we were very careful about making sure we didn't do this.... When we got to our room it was very nice but the first thing I noticed was that our ""Ocean Front"" room was blocked by the other buildings on the Hawaiian Village property in front of us... So, if you want an unobstructed ocean front view, DON'T stay at this property! Other disappointments:1. The house keeping NEVER came to our room... Not once and we called, went by the front desk and asked and nothing... 2. Our teenage son had to sleep on the pullout sofa which would have been fine if the sheets actually fit the bed! And, because we couldn't get service, he just wrapped himself in the blanket for the 2 nights and went without sheets....3. We had been very excited about the lagoon and it was actually one of the main reasons I booked this property... It was actually very disappointing. The water was murky all along the shore (almost like a film of whitish sunscreen) which kept all of us from going in the water. 4. This tower sits next to the pool area that has the slides for the kids, followed by the lagoon area. There are NO food or drink services by either of these areas! I had imagined parking myself on the beach of the lagoon, having a leisurely day with a drink in hand only to find out that if I wanted anything at all to drink or eat, I had to go to the ONLY outside bar on the property which was all the way on the other side of the resort by the other pool area! What a pain!!! This is a huge resort so be prepared to walk because nothing is convenient! 5. The second day we parked ourselves by the other pool so we could enjoy food and drinks.... There was ONE server for the entire area and she was slammed!! By the time our drinks got to us, they were watered down and nasty. Oh, and the minimal amount of food they offer is pretty pathetic for a ""luxury"" resort. SUPER expensive too. We got 3 hotdogs and a pizza type thing (no french fries... they don't have french fries!!) and the bill was almost $60!!All in all, VERY disappointing and I will never stay there again.","Santa Clarita, California","BJMUTA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Clarita, California</strong>",22,3.0

Twice, we rented an umbrella down the beach for 1/2 the price of the hotel and had a better time in playing in the waves there. But our boys hated the whole walk back to HHV with sand-filled swim trunks.

At first glance the location of HHV seems to be great. The Waikikian is a beautiful hotel / time share. The rooms are tip top with all the amenities; full kitchen, washer dryer, flat screens, cable TV, working AC. We had a 1 bedroom which was a bit small for a family of 4, the lanai was a bit small also. Since we were ""owners"" we had no maid service and had to call for extra coffee and towels. No biggie, except when we did call no one ever showed up! We had to stop a maid in the hall and grab some new towels. Besides that the staff were attentive and friendly. In all the Waikikian was a nice hotel, but unfortunately it is part of the nightmare that is the HHV.This was my second and last stay at HHV (previously without children). I am a very seasoned traveler, so let me list my gripes:1. The pools - The kids wanted to swim in the pools. However, unless you were down by 6:30 am you were not going to get a chair to be able to watch over your kids (especially at the one with waterslides). At one point it rained, people left there sandals on the chairs and went indoors to ""reserve"" their seats. This is BS. We swam in all the HHV pools except the private pool at Ali'i Tower. Every pool was grotesquely dirty. I had the misfortune of wearing goggles while I swam and got a first hand view of the ""debris"" field in the water including band aides and various ""other"" things floating around the bottom.2. The hottubs - forget about it. You'll be should-to-shoulder with kids and adults, no one obeys the limits on people allowed in the tubs at one time.3. The ""Lagoon"" - man it looks like it would be a great place to swim with the kids. Water is calm and flat. It looks clean... It's FREEZING. I mean if you are that hot and you need to cool off, by all means jump in. You won't stay in long, neither will your teeth-chattering blue-lipped children. Wear a wet-suit. Also, the water gets deep pretty quickly toward the center, keep your new swimmers close. Also, the sand on this beach might as well be a sidewalk, it is that hard - ouch!4. The Beach at HHV - OK, so you would expect the beach to be crowded because of the nature of the HHV Resort concept and its location. If you rent a couple chairs and an umbrella you can carve out your own little private hovel. However, you'll pay dearly for that privilege. The beach itself is nice, the ocean in this area is rocky, so wear some water shoes if you have tender feet.5. The Hilton Hawaiian Village - This is one of the ""features"" of staying at HHV. You have your own little village of way overpriced restaurants and shops to peruse. It is easy to take the kids on a stroll and let them shop around. The good news is that CJ's Deli is actually pretty good authentic deli food, I'd go there again. The bad news is that everything else is very average and is not priced averagely. Further, if you like to walk, getting anywhere else outside of HHV is a pretty good hike!6. Tropics Restaurant - Here's the deal. It is a gorgeous looking place. Its right on the beach and has a terrific view of the ocean. You get there early and try to get a table and find out they are booked. So they'll give you a buzzer and ""buzz"" you when a table is ready. There are couches outside and some torches and a band playing Hawaiian tunes. Go get yourself a beer while you wait. However, don't get one for your wife they will only server you one drink at a time, she'll have to go get her own. OR you can wait for a waitress, but you'll be seated in the restaurant before she arrives. Once inside odds are against you to get a beach front table, since there are more inside tables than out. Still the inside is nice and a great looking place. Here's where things get bad. The food is just aweful. Maybe our expectations were too high? But for the fan-fair and 1.5 hr wait combined with tasteful design and beachside prices I expected more than Hilton Cafe Food. Regular travelers who stay at Hilton's, Marriotts, etc know what I 'm talking about here. Hotels usually have 1 or 2 ""quality or named"" restaurants and 1 cafe, (usually for bfast or cheap late meals). Cafe food is not what you would expect from Tropics, but its what you get and you pay top $ for this. This was by far the most disappointing part of our stay at HHV.In would recommend the Grand Waikikian as a hotel but not the HHV as a resort.","Portland, Oregon","00gman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",12,4.0

This hotel has only been open about one year, and everything is maintained beautifully.Pros: Leis upon arrival; great customer service at both front desk and concerige; beautiful view at 24th floor oceanview unit; HHV is an amazing facility complete with shops and restaurants; HHV is walking distance to most sights in Waikiki. Cons: Crowded!!!! We were there peak season (after xmas, but before Near Years) and everything was too busy. It felt like Las Vegas during high season to us (just warmer and on a beach). Pool chairs were all ""taken"" (aka: reserved) at pool opening. Beach towel area closes at 5pm, so if you come back after a long day of sightseeing, you won't be able to get a towel if it is after 5pm. Pool hours: they all close early (by 7pm). So, if you were looking at having a nice relaxing hot tub after dinner - won't happen. During our 3 day stay, we never once actually got in the pool. Tried a couple of times and gave up.Possibly we are unique travelers, but love going to out of the way places that are relaxing and peaceful. This certainly did not meet our needs in that manner. Will we come back? Possibly - for a very short stay and we would have to have a reason to venture to this beautiful, but very crowded resort.As far as the Grand Waikikian, it is amazing and if you like or are used to traveling (and don't mind) to very busy spots - this might be what the doctor ordered.",Alaska,"AKEduktr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alaska</strong>",11,4.0

There is alot of walking involved as their elevators are at far end of long hallway and the staircaseS to get into Hilton Hawaiian Vlg or to Paradaise Pool are back at check-in/driveway area. There are a few side door staircases that you can take down to driveway cut over to front check-in counter/shops of HHVlg. But, basically if you stay at HHV you best understand it's huge complex and there is no way around not hiking it every where, we enjoy the exercise though and the gardens are gorgeous all around grounds! The 2 bdrm/2bath premier ocnvw condo has elegant furniture and all hardwood flooring, with granite counter tops. The living room is tight, especially if you fold out the sofa sleeper, you basically have to climb over to get to kitchen area. Don't know if it's mostly timeshare situation vs hotel room, but the hardwood floors need good moping, turned our feet or stockings black with dirt and all the mirrors were so dirty had to really use elbow power to clean them to be able to see ourselves!!! One negative, in these very front of building units, while the view is as good as you will get toward Harbor and between Ali'i Twr & Rainbow Twr to left (as Lagoon Twr is in front of GW blocking majority of Lagoon and ocean view with Rainbow Twr blocking ocean views to left of Lagoon Twr ) there is NO sun on front balcony until after noon,. Although there is side balcony off second bedroom facing Tapa Twr with views of mountains to left (between Kalia & Tapa Twrs) and ocean between Ali'i and Rainbow Twr, BUT they did not put table and chairs or sunbather on that balcony, only one chair and small end table ??? rendering it very useless if you want to relax in sun in mornings! Cost cutter that is annoying and ridiculous after making sure to spend on interior amenities of condo. Another annoying timeshare factor, is upon check-in if you don't get agent in good mood or generous attitude, all your hard work to secure best possible unit/views, is immediately shot down if they deem you are not getting above 20th floor to see over the Ali'i Tower to ocean (you will only get view of ocean between Ali'i Twr and Rainbow Twr, I call that PARTIAL OCNVW, which only gets worse the lower your floor goes because of trees in village, along with parking lot roof next to GW! If there are upper floor units available for week's stay (which there were lots, we checked later at night at front desk), why not give them to customers and keep the good will/feelings going?$! Front desk agents on power trips ?!There is lots to do on Oahu, tons of excellent restaurants ie Duke's, Hula Grill, Ocean House, House Without A Key, Yard House, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Benihana's, etc and shopS. Have to rent car to get out to sightsee because there is so much to enjoy as far as beaches and natural Oahu beautiful sights.Next time if we rent or do timeshare here we will stay at Lagoon Tower, as they are refurbishing them now, views are much better and units have more space in living room area.","Chicago, Illinois","Tredpositive</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",81,4.0

We asked for directions numerous times, as first time visitors, we were unaware that ""local"" directions are nothing like what they are in the other states, no North, South, East, West, only toward diamondhead, or away from the ocean, and that's only on one side of Oahu, locals on the other side have a different set.

The Grand Waikikian is newest building in the Hilton Hawaiian Village and its units are all time share suites with kitchen and washer/dryer. The lobby is beautiful and the rooms are very nice. Make sure you ask for a oceanview on a higher floors and not a partial oceanview if you really want an ocean view. I personally don't think it is worth the extra money for a partial oceanview when you can only see a small view of the ocean between other buildings (we were already on the 22nd floor). Please understand that the guests at the Grand Waikikian share the grounds of the Hilton Hawaiian Village and that includes the pools and lagoon . This is a huge place with six high raise hotel buildings. I think the pool areas are too small for a hotel this size and it is way over capacity especially during weekends. Self parking is $24 a night in a indoor parking lot that's larger than some of the shopping mall's parking lot. The signage and instruction getting around the parking lot is terrible. I spend time looking for my car or getting out of the lot everyday because there were no clear directional signage. Maybe valet would have been a better choice. The staff's services are inconsistent. Many of them were not friendly thru out the village. They were not flexible and doesn't seem like they want to do any extra for the quests. For example, we wanted to get to the beach early and got to the pool side at 7:50 am for our towels. The staff at pool side told us we have to wait until 8:00 am or we have to walk to a different building for the towels. The other building requires about 10 minute walk. Since he was doing nothing and waiting for 8:00 am, what's wrong with handing out a towel to your guests 10 minutes earlier and make them happy? We stayed at Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel (3 star) for one night before our cruise and the staffs were much more friendlier and helpful. The Hilton Hawaiian Village provides many convenient for family with young children. It has many shops and restaurants within the village. However I find it too crowded and overwhelming at times. Also the staff did not impress me at all with the exception of the staff at the Italian restaurant. If you want to stay here make sure you stay at the Grand Waikikian building. Some of the other buildings and rooms in the HHV are really dated for a 4 star hotel and not worth the money.","New York City, New York","thc152</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",84,3.0

Check in was very quick and the person who helped us was extremely nice. I asked about the cost of upgrading to a ocean view room and their were none available, but when we arrived at our room it was a partial ocean view. It was mostly city view, but did have a partial ocean view if you looked to the left. We originally booked city view so I wasn't expecting any type of ocean view. I assume we were slightly upgraded, but didn't ask so can't be sure. Our room also did not have the tub in the room, just a regular bathroom, which was nice and spacious, but not the big tub, so not sure about that. As other reviewers have noted, the Grand Waikikian is quite a ways from the main strip, but we did not find this to be a problem for us. We walked down (~20 minutes) one night and took the bus on a another occasion, but honestly didn't have a reason to go there everyday. There are plenty of restaurants near the Hilton Vacation Village. On site restaurants are super expensive, so we mainly ate offsite, but honestly everything in Hawaii is expensive so if you're going, unless you plan to eat at McDonald's everyday, be prepared to pay for food. Although we didn't cook in the room, we did buy some things for breakfast which saved money on a few of our days there so the fridge did come in handy. The Ala Moana shopping center is within walking distance (or a short trolley ride) and has a Foodland grocery store there. Again, this is not the mainland so do not expect mainland prices, even at a grocery store.We rented a car for 1 day to drive up to the North Shore which was nice. I highly suggest doing that. We took other posters advice and parked at the Marina just past the Grand Waikikian entrance. BEWARE that the machines do not give you change. We thought it did and put in a $5, but only needed it for about 12 hours. Our ticket was stamped for 12 hours, but we didn't get anything back. Granted we only lost $2, but I just hate when something like that happens. Someone who was in front of us lost there money as well except it was because they took too long as they were looking for extra change. They didn't get a ticket at all and had to pay all over again. Overall though, there was plenty of space and our car was safe. Oh, we also rented from Alamo which was right across the street. There was also an Enterprise and National in the same center. I would personally say there is really no reason to rent a car for your entire stay. We took the city bus several time and it is cheap and easy. It is $2.25 per person and you can get a transfer that lasts for 4 or 5 hours, which means you do not have to pay again on your way back to the hotel. We did this to visit Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head, and just for Dinner. $4.50 roundtrip for 2 people can't be beat. The concierge at the Grand Waikikian was very helpful in helping us determine which bus we needed to catch and printing off schedules for us. Super easy!Overall, my husband and I thought the room was very nice and we spent a lot of there. The pool was crowed when we first arrived, but by Tuesday, the pools were much less. I think we went right after peak season though. Pools, beach, and rest of Hilton Village were just a short walk. I really like the location of Grand Waikikian as it was convenient to everything...restaurants, bus stops, shopping, beach. We really didn't have any complaints.Other tips: Visit the Swap Meet for all your souveniers. Everything there is much cheaper than the stores around the hotels. The only thing we didn't buy there was Hawaiian chocolate, which they probably couldn't sell out there due to the heat.","Atlanta, Georgia","georgiaroots80</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",4,5.0

The only issue with the suite was that the dryer takes all day to dry anything. The pool at the GW was mobbed with kids (including my own) using the water slides. It was not a relaxing environment at all. The Super pool was a little better. We did not care for the lagoon at HHV . The man made ""beach"" felt like hard concrete covered with a very thin layer of very rough sand. We also did not care for the stretch of Waikiki beach that fronts HHV.

The rooms were quiet. We did not hear any outside noise from the pools, etc. The beds were very comfortable, even the sofa bed which our 12 year old slept on. We have two children ages 10 an 12, and they enjoyed using the pools and the lagoon. It was great to have the shops and eateries right on site. It was also very convienent to pick up tours from within the Hilton Village. Overall it was an excellent week. We found everyone to be very friendly and eager to help!

This is our third trip to this resort and we thoroughly enjoyed our previous stay at the Lagoon tower. We were looking forward to the new tower. Our family has been a HGVC owner for over ten years and we have truly enjoyed the HGVC ownership until our visit to the Hilton Grand Waikikian. Being a HGVC owner, we know the practice of room assignment and had requests notated for our reservation. None of the requests were met. The check in process seemed smooth but not friendly and the room was not the luxury we were expecting or lead to be expecting. We felt that we were bumped to a very low 11th floor. When we confronted the front desk, we were told that the building is fully booked and nothing could be done. In all my travels, I was surprised of the callous answer. In addition when you check in, make sure you request to have your room card specially coded to use the parking garage if you have a rental car otherwise you will have an angry line of cars behind you while you are trying to swipe your room key.To be fair, the room was very clean and well maintained; of course the place is new. All appliances work well and were clean. The rooms were comfortable and very clean. The lobby area is very nice and very well decorated. The resort has many amenities, shops and restaurants. The beach is nice and a protected area for swimming. It truly is a good family resort.Something has changed since our previous visits. The staff did not smile or acknowledge you but to be fair there were a couple of occasions of friendly staff members. As a return visitor we were expecting a level of service we have come to know from Hilton due to previous visits. Our room living area was very small, in fact smaller the any previous HGVC property we have visited in our travels.We tried to use the pool next to the GW. During busy period, too crowded and even counted fifteen small children in the Jacuzzi or hot tub (on several days). Also, people put towels on chairs (in the morning) to reserve a spot, even though they are not at the pool.We have visited other Hilton properties and after we left the GW, we stayed a week on the Big Island at a Hilton GVC resort. Level of service on the Big Island was excellent. Staff friendly and our suite was very nice in comparison to the GW.In summary, I would recommend a visit to the facility but would recommend the Lagoon Tower. If you had to stay in the Hotel the Rainbow tower has a great view and we also enjoyed our stay in the Tapa Tower (years ago), ocean facing corner room. To add, I was on vacation and I am not a confrontational person or one who complains or is demanding. I love HGVC, they have been great up to this point. It just seems that the staff is not happy working at this resort. I prefer to let my wallet finalize any negotiations.","Friendswood, Texas","HGVC_Member</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Friendswood, Texas</strong>",19,3.0

We chose the Grand Waikikian over the other Hilton Towers for the extra space and the in-room kitchen and laundry and to be in a location that was quieter. It was all of those. The rooms were comfortable and clean yet on the small side. The laundry was helpful, but took forever. It was near impossible to get a chair at the pool. The lagoon was close by, but the ocean beach...which was wide and open...was a little further away. This was fine for our family. As a Hilton Gold, we recieved complimentary breakfast in members lounge in the Rainbow Tower...coffee, juice, pastries, fruit and hard boiled eggs.Overall, this hotel worked for us.

Our previous visit was spent at the Lagoon Tower, and on this visit we were in the new Grand Waikikian Tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village.First, the new tower is quite lovely, with upscale decor and amenities throughout. Since everything is practically brand new it's hard to complain about the place.Our first three nights were in the Penthouse on the 37th floor. We had a two room master suite and there is no doubt this unit is very deluxe and upscale. Stainless steel, marble, granite and topnotch appliances, furnishings and bath amenities etc. We had a beautiful view of the ocean and the Hilton property.Out next seven nights were in a two bedroom plus unit on the 31st floor. We specifically asked to be on the Ewa/Harborside view since we wanted to see the fireworks on the 4th of July. So while we did miss the open ocean view from the Diamond Head side, we had a great view for the fireworks.These rooms are smaller and more ""cozy"" than the two bedroom penthouse. Instead of a separate dining room and table, there was a cute nook area, that we actually preferred over a separate dining area. There was not as much granite/marble and the appliances were black and not SS, and the soaps were standard fare rather than L'Occitane as they were in the penthouse. Here rather than a two king bedroom master we had a king bedroom and two queens in the second bedroom, which was better for our family of four.There is no doubt this is a very lovely project.We found the service to be excellent and we had no problem with the valets or bellhops, we simply called ahead and usually found our car waiting for us.Now for the negative - While this is a beautiful property, in my opinion it is no match for the older Lagoon Tower which is lagoon front and only steps from the beach. To us the Grand Waikikian was just too far removed from the overall Hilton Village and way too far from the beach. Now for some this wouldn't be a problem, but for us, we will book the Lagoon Tower if we do make it back to Honolulu, simply because we prefer its location over the Grand Waikikian.","Los Angeles, California","ricoba</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",45,4.0

The timeshare was spacious and well appointed. The Hilton Hawaiian Village was beautiful but very crowded. The food in the restaurants was good but way overpriced. We ate many of our meals across the street at the 24 hour coffee house. The pools were also extremely busy and it was often difficult to get chairs unless you arrived very early/late in the day. The parking fee of $25 per day was way too much and parking was not convenient if you were staying in the Waikikian. Save your money and park in the public harbor parking lot just past he entranced to the Waikikian. The Hilton Hawaiian Village was pretty far from the heart of Waikiki beach and all it's shops and restaurants. If you have a car it's not a problem but parking was hard to come by.

We have stayed at the Lagoon tower many times and were looking forward to experiencing the new tower. There were 6 of us, my husband and myself and our three grown kids(25,21,18) plus our other son(best friend) 18.We were booked in room 3005, a two bedroom plus. I remembered reading the new entrance was on the backside and not to go in the main HHV entrance so we had no trouble arriving. We were a day late due to airline and were allowed to check-in at 1:00 p.m. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the bellman brought our luggage up within 5 minutes of us reaching our room. The new lobby and furnishings are beautiful koa wood and traditional hawaiian. It is very elegant. The elevators are quite a distance from the lobby, you will walk a lot here as the new tower is far from the rest of the village. The rooms are very nice but smaller than the lagoon tower. They are new so are in good condition, but I prefer the spaciousness of the living/dining area in the lagoon tower rooms. The view is good but you can barely see Diamond Head from your lanai unlike the beachfront view in the lagoon tower. We had a king room and a 2 double bed room set-up. My one dislike for the six of us is yes there were two bathrooms but the shower in the master is glass and right in the bedroom. Therefore, no one can shower with someone else in the room. A separate shower/toilet combo would be good for having 6 adults in one unit. The washer and dryer are right in your room, they are apartment size and front loaders. Therefore, they take longer to both wash and dry. It is very nice to have them though. Having the kitchen is great, saves money on breakfast and lunch. We enjoyed the new pool, the boys had fun on the slides. Yes, it is very crowded, and lots of kids,(there are slides) but we managed to always get lounge chairs. Not together since their were 6 of us, but in groups. We did not eat at any on property restaurants this time, but did find it interesting the Village Steak house is closed/gone and the Rainbow lanai only serves breakfast. The Chinese restaurant is closed/gone as well. The economy must be the reason. It was odd that a huge resort would not have more restaurants available. The food choices in the shopping area are all still open. We had very good service from all staff, and were even given a late check-out by the manager.

This was our first stay in the new tower, we have previously been in the Lagoon or Rainbow. We bought in the Waikikian 2 years ago and have been anxiously awaiting its opening. Now having been there we are seriously considering selling. Our 2 bed 2 bath room was ok but not the luxury we were hoping for. Bathroom & kitchen counterspace is non existant, beds are like sleeping on a slab of concrete, the washer/dryer would have been a great convenience had they washed or dryed well or in a timely manner. The view from 26 was pretty good but nothing beats the views from the Rainbow. We were surprised at how in just a few months of being open our room was already trashed. Hardwood floors scratched, walls with not just paint chips but huge scrapes and dings. The beautiful tile in the bath had grout and paint all over the tiles. The kitchen was filthy, grease all over the stovetop & cupboards and the blender hadn't been washed from the previous guests.Having been there every year for the last 5 years, sometimes 2 or 3 times a year, we are aware of the higher prices for food etc... so that was no surprise. What did surprise us was that the some of the restaurants were temporarily or permanently closed. The new ""Super Pool"" should have it's name changed to the kiddie pool. You couldn't get near it to use the pool or hot tubs and with the amount of kids peeing in it you probably wouldn't want to anyway.As return visitors we have come to expect a certain level of service and it's just not there. Employees didn't acknowledge you if you passed, didn't inquire if they could asssist you in anyway. None of the normal chit chat and friendliness that has always been there. We spoke to a long time employee and she explained it's all because of the ""economy"". The employees are mad because friends have been let go, they fear for there own jobs and they just don't care to provide the service that we're used to.....yes she actually said this to us, guests. She claims it's not just HGV though, service in all the hotels and restaurants is poorer now because of the economy. What an excuse! I think Hilton needs to give their employees a little pep talk and remind them that guests are spending thousands of dollars when times are tough and they had better be providing the same level of service Hilton's known for or better if they want people to return.",seattle,"dahlia13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>seattle</strong>",3,3.0

All four of us loved this property. We walked through Waikiki on a few occasions, and after seeing other hotels, I was very glad we chose the one we did. We had not previously stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV), and much of the enjoyment was with the HHV in general, rather than the GW in particular -- although we thought the room was great as well. We loved the feel of the entire property -- the lagoon, the tropical animals (pink flamingos, penguins, koi, etc). And although it is on the very western end of Waikiki, walking into Waikiki in the evenings for dinner was no problem at all. It probably took us 10 minutes to walk to other restaurants in Waikiki.I have read some reviews of guests who were unhappy with the service at the HHV. We encountered very friendly and helpful staff and had no problems at all.Our only complaint is the price of food on the property. The food by the pool was overpriced, but you can go to the pool bar at the military hotel next door, and you will pay about half the price that you pay at HHV.The room was perfect for us It was very nicely decorated and is brand new.

I requested early check in and a top floor - neither of these requests were met (well check in was accommodated at 3:30 instead of 4). We were on the 10th floor. I informed the lady at check in that I had requested a high floor and that it was our 10th wedding anniversary and she curtly responded that this was all there was. I booked a ""resort"" view room. Based on the GW web site I expected a ""resort view"" to be of the HHV grounds but our view was of the city and city roads (Iilikai, Holiday Inn, etc.). I could not even see HHV grounds. I talked to a few employees including our bell man and housekeeping and they informed us that we were in a city view room. My husband initially complained to a lady at the front desk who IMO lied and told him that we had been upgraded as the room we were in was brand new. What the heck? Even if no one had stayed in that particular room before, the GW only opened approx 3 months before our trip so the entire place is new. After complaining to management and showing them our res for a resort view we were informed that the ""city"" view is the resort view and is in the same $ category. Upon checking the web site there is no choice for a ""city"" view. Management indicated that there were no other rooms available but if we wanted to move up to the 29th floor in a room with 2 double beds we could do so. I looked at the room and it was identical to ours with the exact same view, just higher up. If I stood out on the lanai I could see the ocean(but could not see any of the resort) but not worth moving to us and giving up a king bed. The new pool area was extremely crowded, tons of little kids and families. So much so that when I would go for my morning run people had already left towels marking their chairs before 7:00 a.m. By 9:00 a.m. most of the chairs were taken, prompting us to make sure to be down by the pool by 8:30 a.m. The staff were not overly friendly or helpful but were not rude to us either. However, I did overhear one housekeeper telling a guest that they ""need to get out of their room now so it could be cleaned"". The lagoon was great for our 3 1/2 year old not very deep and no waves/current to knock him down. But I thought that the prices for renting a paddle boat, kayak, paddle board were very high. Paddle boat was $20 for 1/2 hour or $31 for 1 hr. Kayak was similar. Paddle board was $40 for 1 hr. Much better prices a little further up the beach.Overall our room was nice and was as depicted on the web site (with the exception of the view). The dryer did take an extraordinary amount of time to dry the clothes.The GW was a little further down from beach walk and the main area of Honolulu than I expected. But, it was still within walking distance probably 20 minutes at a leisurely stroll.We did not have to park a car, but the public parking lot at the marina literally across the street from the GW is a lot cheaper (I think $6 or so a day vs $24) and there is a gate near the lagoon the enters into the parking lot. My in-laws live in the marina on their boat and I felt very safe walking through the parking lot at all different hours. I would definitely park a car there if $ were a consideration.I would recommend this hotel to a friend if they don't mind crowds with little kids and being further away from restaurants and the beach walk.","Truckee, California","Chicotravel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Truckee, California</strong>",30,3.0

We had booked a one bedroom partial ocean view. Check-in was efficient when we arrived, and the lobby area is very nice and spacious. It is a long walk to the room, but we expected that. We stayed on the 8th floor, and had a very poor view, mostly of the hotel next door, but also of the lagoon tower directly in front of the hotel. One would need a top-floor room to avoid the view of the other towers between GW and the beach. The room itself is nicely appointed, but the sheets on the pull-out couch were filthy. Most of the appliances worked; the dryer did take an extraordinarily long time to dry clothes. It was convenient to have the laundry and kitchen in the unit, and there is a small convenience store very near the hotel for a few food items. The Food Land grocery store is also within walking distance and has greater selection.The hotel is on the HHV grounds, and the grounds are impressive. Nice foliage, exotic animals. The pool at the GW is nothing special-a few small waterslides in a small pool. It was nice to be able to walk along the grounds, and we did eat at most of the restaurants at the HHV, which were overpriced but adequate. Be aware that the children's menu only extends to those under 8; those older pay adult prices.We participated in the various activities the hotel offered-hula lessons, lei making, Friday parade, etc. Be sure to sign up for these as soon as you arrive as there is a limited number of openings, although it really isn't clear why. My children enjoyed participating in them.What did stand out about this property was the uniformly poor service. Not a single employee seemed to do anything above the bare minimum, and then only grudgingly, and never offered to help a guest. We showed up for the free snorkel lesson, only to have to hunt down the bored beach instructor who spent two minutes handing my child a mask and walked off. The animal keeper at penguin feeding time seemed positively annoyed by guests' questions and walked off without saying goodbye, leaving a puzzled crowd. Neither the check-in clerks nor the concierge knew when any activities were scheduled or offered to find out. The children's activities staff seemed to do the bare minimum, and the manager I approached about an issue was indifferent at best.

The pool had just opened and was quite a hit with the children, as it has a water slide. There is a small spa at the pool, as well – with emphasis on “small.” Having read earlier reviews, I can say that some “issues” seem to have been resolved. My thoughts on our stay: Check in was a breeze. Although we were a bit confused and showed up at the HOTEL part of The Hilton. We did not realize the Grand Waikikian had a separate area/location for checking in. We were also presented with leis, which was a nice touch. The new 1-bedroom condo (I’m not sure what it’s officially called, so I’ll refer to it as a condo.) was spacious, well appointed, loved the large garden tub connected to the bedroom, loved the large balcony. The kitchen was well appointed with dishwashing liquid, laundry detergent, coffee maker, coffee, tea fridge with ice maker, rice cooker, paper towels, microwave – really everything we needed. The granite countertops in the kitchen and bathroom are what one would expect at a new Hilton.  It is my understanding that internet is free if you stay at the Grand Waikikian, although we did not bring laptops. The furniture was comfortable. The king-sized bed was heavenly. Plenty of pillows and soooffffffttttt linens…although I suppose being so new, the linens did shed and my husband and I would wake up with white fuzz balls in our hair an on our black night clothes (minor complaint). There is a flat-panel TV in the living room and bedroom.  The bathroom has a separate shower and plush towels. There are drawers for your toiletries to keep them out of sight. One thing that was missing was a vanity mirror (minor complaint). I wondered if we would be bothered by outside noise. We were not! It was so quiet, we slept like babies! There was a small, but sufficient in-room safe in the closet. The a/c kept the room nice and cool. There was no hint of cigarette smoke or any other smell for that matter. It’s hard to imagine that someone would smoke in the rooms, as there is a law prohibiting smoking in most places in Hawaii except for at the beach and on public sidewalks.  When we tried to use the washing machine in the room, it definitely needed to be reset. If this is a glitch or is “the norm,” it would help if management posted a note near the washer explaining how to reset the washer so that it will come on.  Getting to the elevator to actually get to your floor is a bit tricky from the check-in area. It’s kind of like a maze, and the first elevator will take you down to the parking lot, so it would be advisable to post signs such as “elevator to parking garage,” and “elevator to rooms.”  We found that taking the parking lot elevator down to ground level would put us right at the street next to an ABC shop, restaurants and other conveniences.  There was still some ongoing construction at the building and pool; but these were minor nuisances at most. The fountain at the entrance to the building leading toward the elevator was being completed, so on some days we had to walk by construction noise and the smell of what can only be described as “airplane glue.” I assume that was a temporary issue. The pool restaurant was not completed, so there was no opportunity to get a quick bite while staying near the pool. Again, a minor inconvenience. Being able to ask for and receive as many towels as we wanted – and not having to return them was convenient.  The lounge chairs at the new pool were definitely side-by-side, so it would have been better to have a larger lounge area around the pool and adjacent to the lagoon (which is lovely, by the way); but that seems to be the norm at most hotels. People do put towels out early in the day to reserve lounge chairs which many do not use. Someone should come up with a universal solution to this “unused lounge chair held captive” approach to allow those of us who actually LOUNGE IN CHAIRS ALL DAY a chance to use them. Also, I do not understand why there are no umbrellas around the new pool to allow shade for those of us who do not want to bake and burn. It was lovely not smelling cigarette smoke from folks around the pool, so three cheers for the no-smoking law in Hawaii. I would say my biggest complaint is that I would have liked to seen more open lounge chair surface areas and an option to lounge under an umbrella.  Thus far, I have not read anyone mention the hospitality floor at the Grand Waikikian. It is reserved for those who have checked in before their room is available and also those who need a place to stay after they have checked out. It reminded me of the first-class lounges at airports. There are drinks, snacks, a place to store luggage, separate sitting areas with televisions, and I believe we were told that there are even showers for use. This is a nice option that will certainly come in handy for a lot of guests. I am a very picky traveler who is more likely to give a negative review versus a positive one. So all in all, it was a good experience, and I would recommend the Grand Waikikian for the spacious and new rooms, and the ease of walking next door to dine at the many restaurants, shops, and the various other pools on the grounds of this massive property located on one of the widest beaches on Waikiki.","Houston, TX","jamiedalejuliegail</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, TX</strong>",113,5.0

We got back from our 2009 trip last night. This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. We booked a 5 night package directly with the Hilton. The package included 5 nights at the new Grand Waikikian, a rental car for 5 days, and 10,000 Alaska Airlines miles. When I booked the package I explained that we would only need a car for one day as we intended to spend most of our time at the beach. The car was needed for a quick business meeting on the west side of the island and a trip to the north shore afterwards. I was assured that the car would be ready to go at the Hawaiian Village on the day requested. When we checked in we quickly realized that the hotel was not completely finished. The pool was not open, many of the interior pots were not filled, and there was construction all over the hotel. We got such a great deal on the package that we were prepared to overlook that last minute things the hotel was completing. The day we arrived we visited the concierge desk to confirm that our car would be ready for us. We discovered that the hotel (and Hertz) had no record of our reservation. We were told a manager would correct the mistake and call us back right away. We went to lunch and when we came back we had a message confirming our request. On the morning we needed the car we went to the Hertz desk to find out that they still could not find our reservation. We went back to the concierge desk and the poor girl behind the counter made several calls to get us a car asap as we had a meeting we were going to be late for. It turned out that the car was being held at the airport, not the hotel, and would not be ready until noon (well after the 9am time we were confrimed for via phone two days prior). After we were told we could pick up the car Hertz told us we had to pay for it because the Hilton had not authorized payment. We just paid for it because we had to go even though the car was part of our pre-paid package. When we returned to the hotel that evening I requested to speak to a manager. No one would come down to speak with us. I asked to be reimbursed for the car rental. I was told that a manager would get back to me that evening with a solution. A manager called me a few hours later but could not give me a solution and said someone else would call me ""first thing in the morning."" At this point I was very frustrated but I agreed to wait for the morning call. Around 11am the next morning we still had not gotten a call. Again, I went to the office to speak to a manager. Again, no one wanted to help us and clearly no one had been working on a resolution. Later in the day I got a call from one of the ""managers"" of the reservation group. She is still working on getting this issue solved at this time. The whole experience was time consuming and frustrating on our ""relaxing"" vacation to Hawaii. The people working in the hotel never smiled or seemed pleased to see us. We didn't ask for much....a clean room and a rental car at the hotel as requested and confirmed. Overall I would not recommend staying at the Hawaiian Village. I feel like they are so big they don't really care about the average traveler. We also stayed two nights at the Outrigger Reef where everyone was friendly, helpful, and nice. It was cheaper than the Hilton too and in a better location on the beach. You can also get a drink for under $12 which is what a Mai Tai will run you at the Hilton!","Phoenix, Arizona","Megs98198</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",37,2.0

We had a 2 bedroom ocean view ( I believe an accidental upgrade since we had only asked for a 1 bedroom ocean view).The decor is beautiful. The kitchen had all major appliances necessary for self catering.We had daily room service by extremely courteous staff!I had unfortunately triggered the smoke alarm with cooking and hotel staff promptly came to disarm the unit.It's a pity that the pool isn't ready, but to be quite honest that did not affect the quality of our stay as the walk to the Superpool and lagoon is so short.One comment that I have to make is the front staff. They, I think are still evolving . We wanted to extend our stay by one night, since late check out in the hotel is 11 am and our flight wasn't until 10 pm, so that really wasn't too helpful.I asked front desk if they could do the booking for us and was spoken to by a rather rude young lady who addressed me as "" you folks"" which I thought was terribly inappropriate.She then told me that I had to call the general line for bookings. When I did this they said that the hotel should be able to do this.I called her back and she proceeded to tell me that I should call the general line again! I told her that this was not my job to do and that I would like to speak to her manager.Within the hour, the Manager did the booking and personally came out to our room to drop the receipt and new keys.All in all, our experience was great and we would recommend this place to anyone.",Vancouver,"reebs1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver</strong>",4,5.0

The kinks of a new Property are yet to be worked out.Kinks:1. They had me booked in a Partial Ocean View when I booked a Ocean View (Bring your hotel confirmation with you)2. It took three tries to find an acceptable room and they ended up giving us a 2 bedroom vs a one bedroom at a discounted price.3. The computer went down and they could not issue keys so they had to escort everyone to their rooms until they could deliver keys.4. The new pool area is not open which they did not tell people. You can use the faclities at HHV.5. The cable box is hidden behind the cabinet which was a mistake becuase Time Warner cable boxes shut off on there own alot and unless you know where it is to turn it back on you won't have tv. After maintenance showed me where it was I had to turn it on 3 more time during the week.6. The washer and dryer have a water shutoff valve which was triggered on ours which needed to be reset before we could use it.I actually had a great time and really enjoyed the property but I wanted everyone to know what could happen. Oh, we also heard alot of fire alarms mostly becuase of cooking in the rooms and the smoke detectors.","Los Angeles, California","goldbergd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",19,4.0

One day, and 13 phone calls to Hotel Management / Hilton Corporate later, I have not been offerred a viable solution. Hotel management told me to wait a day, and the front desk may be able to help. Corporate told me hotel management has another 72 hours to respond, which means I could be in a stale smoke-filled room for 3 days.Last night I also called hotel service to bring up sheets for the fold-out bed because I am here with my brother. It is the next morning and still nobody has brought bed sheets. I have to ask whether management is existent at this hotel. Maybe the staff are still developing like the hotel. There is ongoiong construction outside as I write this--and I did not see anything posted about it when I booked my stay last month. To the hotel's credit, it is a beautiful, new building with spacious rooms.I could see how, if you have no issues come up at your stay, and your main interaction is with the concierge, this place would get an exceptional review. It is an exceptional building. As a Hilton Diamond member, I have stayed at many hotels, and I usually encounter good service at Hiltons when problems like mine arise. But here it takes hours for staff to respond to telephone requests, if they respond at all. You have to leave a message to speak with hotel management, and they may not respond to you.A note to Hilton Diamond members: this property has a Penthouse Lounge. The Penthouse Lounge is not to be confused with the Executive Lounge. Diamond members do not have access to the lounge, and at Grand Vacations properties we do not get complimentary breakfast. I learned this when I tried to get breakfast this morning. They will give you a room upgrade, but that is the extent of your VIP benefits.If you want better service, stay at the property next door: The Hilton Hawaiian Village (I like the higher floors of Tapa & or any room in the Ali'i Tower) or the Westin. The staff at the Hawaiian Village are more experienced with handling difficulties. I know this because I stay there almost every month. I also had a great experience with the pricey Westin Moana Surfrider--though you get less value for the room size. You could stay at the Grand Waikikian if you want more space, but the Embassy Suites are spacious. I really like the washer/dryer/sink/room-size that you can't find anywhere else for the price at the Grand Waikikian, but they need responsive management, and better trained staff.",La Jolla,"Christopher F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Jolla</strong>",4,2.0

Because of that we encountered some problems that once they work out the ""new hotel"" kinks - they won't be a problem anymore.First the good.... The property is beautiful. Everything is brand new of course and first quality. The lobby and the public areas are really breathtaking. The kitchen appliances are high end and the decor in each room is just lovely.As with every hotel that is brand new there are problems associated with everything being untested. Our washer and dryer never really worked correctly until the handyman showed us that you have to actually unplug the washer each time you used it because something inside of it had to be reset. The outlet in our bathroom never did work. The pool was not finished and it looks like it has a few more weeks of work to go. You are however steps away from the lagoon which our kids really liked and of course a 4 minute walk from the main pool.On the positive side we did do a lot of complaining and each time we did the managers were VERY nice and listened sympathetically to our issues. All of our issues were slightly annoying but never anything serious like no power or no AC or heaven forbid elevators that didn't work.Even if you are checking in next week go with absolute confidence that you will have a great time and enjoy this beautiful new hotel.Aloha......","Long Island, NY","sleep7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Island, NY</strong>",152,4.0
