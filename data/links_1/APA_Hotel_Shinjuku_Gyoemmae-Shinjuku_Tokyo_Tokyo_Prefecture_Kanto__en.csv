When checking out the frontdesk staff was incredibly lackluster and NOT interested in dealing with the issue or giving a professional response.

The bathrooms are minute. But being Japan, everything is incredibly functional and efficient and after a day you get used to it and make it work.The beds are super comfy (but BYO pillow!) - what they give you is maybe 5cm thick, and nard as a rock - I couldn’t believe it!The shower is very good, great pressure and temperature and they provide high quality towels changed daily. (They don’t change the bedding for the duration of your stay). There is an air conditioning unit in each room but you can’t control the temperature This is a major downside as the hotel decide on a central temperature and that’s what everyone is stuck with - you can turn the unit on or off but it will blow air at the temperature the hotel decides . It was WAY too hot for my stay, thankfully I had a room with a window that opened so I could cool the room that way. I couldn’t use the Onsen as I have tattoos but it seemed popular, and the basement level has an ice machine and laundry (700 yen to wash and dry) which was convenient and appreciated. The lifts can be frustrating as the hotel is so busy, it’s not uncommon to return to a full foyer of people waiting for the lift (that’s if you can fit between the 100s of cases stored in the lobby all day). Having said that it is so quiet in the rooms - however they have done the soundproofing works as you are rarely disturbed by noise from the lifts/corridor and can get a really good sleep.The staff were so helpful to me, especially with changing the huge value notes you get from the ATM in Japan into manageable smaller bills, and allowing me 2 hours late checkout for 2000 Yen which was a blessing given my flight at Narita wasn’t until 5pm. Although it would seem to be a business hotel it is overrun with Western tourists, suggesting correctly that it’s a great base to explore Tokyo - the location could hardly be better. Metro station close by or a 10 minute walk to the JR lines at Shinjuku.Overall a good stay, even with my misgivings about the pillows and the air-con I would stay here again as it was comfortable enough for the price, the location is excellent and the staff very pleasant and helpful.","Melbourne, Australia","aj4422016</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",17,4.0

Upon getting to the room it’s incredibly hot and stuffy so I called and asked why the air conditioning wasn’t working and they said that the air conditioning is centralized which means guests can not control it in the room and that they controlled it. This was not disclosed to me upon checking in. I didn’t pursue the matter and I guess this was my fault because upon coming back from dinner the room was hot and stuffy and now they had turned on the heater because guess what it’s winter in Japan. Umm it’s 20C outside and I called them and here is where the lack of customer service or care comes into play. They don’t care all their other customers are cold and the ones that were hot are given fans so they have run out of fans too.

Lots of restaurants & 24 hr diners in the vicinity, highly recommend the Gyozanofukuho gyozas right across the street that opens late (until 4:30 am on weekdays?) Facilities: small rooms which is the norm in Tokyo, bed ok but mattress slightly tilted, pillows were thin & flat which was standard for all APA hotels & most westerners will find it uncomfy. We requested for extra pillows the first nite but they were out, 2nd day we asked again & 2 very fluffy pillows were delivered promptly. I was impressed by the complimentary spa facilities which had indoor pool and a smaller open air semi-outdoor pool, it was similar to the facilities at the APA hotel & resort Nishishinjuku gochome-eki tower albeit slightly smaller.Staff & service: very prompt & courteous, they also helped us filling out the forms & arranged for Black Cat luggage service which stored 2 of our luggage for 1 week ($3200 JPY only) while we traveled to other countries, then delivered the luggage to our next hotel when we returned.

Lots of self service check in machines that no one was using or were out of service, maybe use that space to store luggage? Lastly. CREATE A SMOKING AREA!

It rather reminds me of a budget airline where you are considered purely as a credit card and not a customer. So different to our next hotel The Knot which was so stylish, cheaper, larger with more comfortable rooms, and let you into your room earlier without paying extra. At this hotel I was forced to sit on the floor as there was nowhere to sit. So unprofessional to have guests sitting on the floor. So there you are finally arrived at your hotel, nowhere to sit you are literally turfed out of the hotel until 1500 when everyone crowds back in to get into their extremely tiny rooms. Luckily close by are the national gardens so we went there and laid on the bench for a couple of hours. Beds I have to admit are comfortable, how the staff actually get in to clean the rooms remains a mystery. We did get used to the room after a few days and would have assumed all hotels in Tokyo are like this had we not stayed next in the Knot.

People were lined up down the street for it.)The amenities in the room were good, the shower was more spacious than some of the other places we stayed in our time here, and the water pressure was also good. It was a nice cozy stay.Check-out was smooth. You drop your cards in a machine that time stamps them and checks you out. This technology was quite interesting, and easy to use. The location was not amazing and we found there were not many decently rated restaurants in the area,(outside of the Michelin restaurant that was lined ulntoonlong for us),however we did not mind the short subway ride.To get back to Haneda airport we took the Marunouchi Line just a short 3 minute walk from the hotel and then caught another subway to the Monorail.

The in house restaurant breakfast choices are ok but dinner menu an unsuccessful mix of cuisines and expensive for what is offered.Before we arrived for our first visit to Tokyo the hotel could not advise how to get there from Narita airport. This is how: go to the JR information point at the airport. Get a ticket for the Narita express (the N’ex express) to Tokyo central; there, get a subway map and find the Maranouchi line, take it and get off at M10. You will need some local currency, available at the airport. Subway tickets are dispensed from machines; choose your language and follow instructions.Once you’ve figured out the amazingly well run train system you will have no problem getting around economically. For instance, a guided tour to Mt Fuji for 2 will cost over 35,000 yen; if you take the Mt Fuji express to Kawaguchiko (one stop past Mt Fuji and best viewing, book a return ticket a few days before at a JR info point or on line) include the cruise on the lake, for less than 20,000 yen total.","Salamander Bay, Australia","Judy C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salamander Bay, Australia</strong>",13,4.0

Yes, it's small, but the rooms are well designed with plenty of facilities. We spent two weeks in the hotel and it was intimate, but perfectly comfortable for a couple. There is a lack of floor space, but we could easily get to our bits and bobs by popping our suitcases on the bed each day so we could open them up properly.The location can't be beat- it's in central Shinjuku, but in a peaceful area close to a beautiful park (which is well worth a visit). There are lots of restaurants and bars around and the hotel also has a restaurant on-site. The train station is a mere 10 minute walk away so it's easy to get around Tokyo. I really appreciated coming back to such a comfortable hotel after a long day sight-seeing.We arrived early and jet lagged, but the staff were happy to look after our bags whilst our room was being prepared which made things a lot easier. Check in was a bit weird as we were supposed to do it on a machine, but it wasn't working so Reception ended up checking us in the old fashioned way. As you would expect from Japan, you have a fancy toilet with a bidet and the rooms are cleaned to a high standard.I can't comment on breakfast and the onsen as we didn't use those facilities (sadly I have a couple of small tattoos and like most onsens in Japan, people with tattoos are banned from using it). The photos certainly looks super cool though, and if I wasn't so bashful I imagine I'd have been a lot more disappointed that I'd missed out.There's a vending machine in the basement which sells cans of beer and shochu as well as soft drinks.

Anyone of my size should consider a different hotel. A major turnoff was the Air Conditioning system. Each level is controlled by front desk. So if everyone is cold the heating will be on. If everyone is hot, the cooling will be turned on.So uncomfortable some nights when you feel very warm and stuffy and you cant have the AC on cool cause the floor you're on pick the heating.I asked for a twin share room and they said they dont exist only the double bed.Which I found odd when its advertised here.The breakfast is delicious.

I think if you are taller it would be uncomfortable. But the shower head is hand held with good pressure so no problems there. We were also travelling with small suitcases. If you have alot of large luggage the room might feel smaller. 2 very flat pillows were provided but we just asked for more at the desk and it was no problem. Spa - free spa included. My husband used it twice and it was nice. The reception warned us about busy times so he just avoided those times.Laundry - 2 small coin washers and dryers are available.

It's also just a few minutes walk to Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden – one of the highlights of Tokyo for me.The hotel itself is ok. My room was very small and somewhat dysfunctional. It's not terribly well designed with a huge television taking up half of the desk space in the room (could the television not be mounted on the wall?), poorly located power sockets and a bathroom designed so that one water faucet provides water for both the shower and sink. The two water pressure options were too high or two low. And the shower spewed water across the bath unavoidably onto the floor. The hotel lifts provided further frustration with some long waits and services stopping at virtually every floor from the tenth down!

My booking had an error and I couldn’t check in (I’d already paid and it was asking me to pay again). Staff fixed the issue quickly and apologised for the issue. The only things to consider for this hotel is that the rooms are tiny. Unless you’ve visited Japan before the room size might shock you. There is room for a bag and a person to stand. With two or more people in the room it gets a little claustrophobic. The other consideration is that the lifts are very popular and at peak periods you might wait 5-10 mins to be able to use the lift. Self check out key drop was a great experience. Would stay again.

We booked a double room (1 full-size bed) for four days. I felt so claustrophobic and DREADED coming back to the room each night. If you've ever been on a cruise, I'd have to say the room and bathrooms are much smaller than the rooms on the ship. The window was tiny and we could barely get any natural light in. The room is so smal that their is a sign in the bathroom stating that one should keep the bathroom door closed when showering or else the steam might trigger the the sprinklers to go off (what?!). The bathroom was even smaller. The faucet for the shower and sink were connected, so you turn one on, the other turns on. However, I have to give the hotel props for cleanliness. It was very clean. When we opted out of getting our room cleaned, hotel staff would always leave a bag of toiletries outside our door (a plus). Also, the wi-fi was TERRIBLE. It was slow, inconsistent, most of the didnt even work, and did not work for us after 10pm. Also only one outlet and two USB ports in the room. Front desk staff was not friendly. We had trouble making reservations to a restaurant in Shibuya and asked the front desk to help. Their response ""Sorry, we don't make reservations"". However, the wouldn't even help us/answer questions about how to use the room phone. Location was great. The subway station was only a few steps away and we easily took the subway to and from the airport and throughout Tokyo. Also, very close to the large shopping streets of Shinjuku. Summary: I am not sure how large the other rooms are, but I would NOT recommend booking a double room at this hotel.

Most restaurant operators understand simple English and English menu is available. I highly recommend the gyoza shop across the road. The food is delicious, service is good and price very reasonable.4 minutes' walk away is the shinjuku san chome station that connects to many major train lines and further down the road is the shinjuku train and bus station that connects to the airport. The hotel is a stone's throw away from the nearest train station. That is a plus point if you are travelling light.

The deluxe double rooms at 11m2 were very small, even by Tokyo standards, making it a life sized game of Tetris to simultaneously open suitcases, or get dressed, or even have a cup of tea and a chat. The length of the double bed set the width of the room, which gives you an idea of what you’re up for. The pillow (and you can safely assume I’m using air quotes when using that word, plus potentially some significant eye rolling) was little more than a plump, yet somehow hard, tea-towel sized slab of cotton. Shockingly uncomfortable. So much so, at 3am on the first night I was rifling through my suitcase (which I had fallen over despite trying my best to wedge under the desk) to see if I could find a rolled up jumper to use as an alternative. I did ask at Reception for a different pillow, or even a second terrible one, but they couldn’t help. Epically bad.My other niggle was that the tap in the bathroom that is used to control both the water to both the wash basin and the shower is around the wrong way. This means when you are trying to turn off the tap you are actually turning it on even more. So if you’re in the shower the sudden blast of water will damn near take your head off, or if you’re attempting to wash your hands, you end up with an alarmingly vigorous stream of piping hot water all over your groinal area. We ate brekky in the hotel once during our stay and at it was reasonable, if unspectacular. Cornflakes were available which in Japan is hard to find, and was very welcome after days of eating lord knows what. ¥1600 well spent.Overall the hotel was good. Location was excellent, rooms were clean albeit hilariously small, and it was reasonable value for money. If I’d brought my own pillow I’d give it 4 stars, but sadly I’ve had to deduct 2 stars because I had to rest my enormous noggin on a small mat rather than a pillow.

In reality it is suitable only for one night for very junior businessmen or women prepared to live in a tiny space lacking in any form of basic comforts. We expect small rooms in Tokyo but these are beyond anything. 11sq m for a ‘double room’. No wardrobe, just two hooks and four hangers. No drawers. No bedside tables. One tiny desk and chair. The bathroom was just tiny and is included in the 11 sq m. There is only one tap that serves both shower and mini basin. We had 14 nights here. No wonder they demand prepayment on arrival before you see your room. It was the worst fortnight of our extensive travels anywhere in the world. We literally had to take turns to stand up and dress. We had to pile our luggage by the door and move it to get out. You cannot even Store a suitcase under the bed. It is on a sort of platform. You have to crawl over each other to get off the bed. There is no hotel lobby area, just a check in desk. No seating area at all in the hotel. The restaurant / bar has very limited opening hours and you cannot even sit in there in between times. Good points? Very small but comfy bed. Clean room. I cannot warn strongly enough against staying here for more than one night with just a quick change of clothes. Simply appalling.

Some were excellent but this one, sadly wasn't. First things first, the overwhelming problem with this hotel is the size of the rooms. Honestly, I've stayed in hotels all over the world and this is by far the smallest room I've ever stayed in. You could literally wake up and make a cup of tea FROM YOUR BED!!The room aside, I didn't find any of the staff particulary welcoming or warming. At no point during my 4 night stay, did I ever feel wanted there as a customer, more that I was a hindrenece and in the way. That goes from the reception staff to the staff in the restuarant, who it appears their main job is to get you in, feed you and get you out as quickly as possible. I could forgive it lacking any kind of facilities (but it did have a downstairs spa) if it had charm and character, but sadly no. This was a cold, clinical chain hotel with tiny rooms, unfreindly staff and no character at all. If I ever go back to Japan, I certainly wouldn't choose this place to stay at again.The only positive thing I'll say about it is that it's in a great location, but equally, so will many other hotels that offer so much more.","Birmingham, United Kingdom","Hoppy22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, United Kingdom</strong>",249,2.0

This huge hotel has decent rooms, although a bit small. I stayed in a room for 2 persons on my own and I am glad I did. Bathroom is tiny and you do not have a lot of space to stow your luggage away. There is a large array of bathing products, toothbrushes, shaving equipment... Beds are soft but have flat pillows. VOD-system and a large tv are also available.On the B1-floor there is a hot tub, vending machines, washing machines and a dryer and a microwave. Everything is very tidy and the cleaning staff does a great job here. Coffee, tea and water are freely available. The hotel is also a great starting point for clubbing and partying. Shinjuku is easily accessible (but if you do not want to walk a mile, I recommend to pay close attention to the time tables of the subway. Last train is around midnight).

Room is very small. The bath area is decent. I was busy touring the city and didn't stay in the small hotel room much. In the last morning of my stay, I had some time to check the room and was shocked by the politically charged books and magazines staged in my room. I assumed every room has the same setup. The owner of the APA chain seemed to be very vocal in propagating right-wing agenda. Among the reading material was a Apple Town magazine. It calls for militarizing Japan. In a book Cherry Blossoms In The Wind in my hotel's desk drawer, war criminals were commemorated and their suicide missions against allies were glorified. One of his another provided free book Japan Pride III - Theoretical Modern History, author denied Nanking Massacre, defamed comfort women as prostitutes and claimed they were well paid and better managed when Japanese took over the operation, and claimed that the Peal Harbor bobming was an American conspiracy. I believe that people can proclaime that coal is white and snow is black. But to force feed guests the history distortion in his own hotel chain? No way. I regret not knowing earlier about Toshio Motoya (元谷 外志雄) and his controversial political view and practice. He can keep it to himself.

I understood it a little as it was in Japanese and my partner who is fluent in Japanese, said it made him very angry and he is against businesses that are racist <-- now for a successful chain of hotels in Japan, this word is very strong and it shows how insensitive APA hotel chain is to people from all walks of life and of many other nationalities. We felt this was anti-chinese. The wifi was bad for me too, sure it worked fine for maybe an hour or less, but after that it wouldn't give me internet even though I was clearly connected. I contacted frontdesk again and the lady kindly came up to my room to show me on her phone that the wifi is clearly working for her and she is unable to help me with why mine does not work. I figured it out on my own later that I had to disable VPN for the public hotel wifi to work. They should allow VPNs to work with public wifi because we want to protect our privacy especially when using a network that other people can access with the same password! How stupid! The way the staff handled payment was bad (please note this is a pre-payment hotel), the staff tried to push me towards a payment MACHINE? to self pay?? How many foreigners will be able to use a payment machine in Japan with their cards and how many foreign credit cards will have a PIN number to be used together? I can't remember mine either as I use it as a credit card -meaning you just hand it over and the charge is made. Simple, why do they try to complicate payment for foreign tourists?It made me feel like the guy at the front desk just wants to have as little contact with guests as possible. Is this an upscale motel? Sure feels like it at this point. Nobody to even help you with your luggage. There is also no view at all. I pulled back the curtains on the small horizontal window above the bed and it shows the stairwell of the next building. It was also hard to find what number to call for the frontdesk (7) I believe it was written in japanese somewhere. Oh and there is no room service, so really, I might as well stay in an airbnb, cheaper, payment is no hassle, communication is prompt and in English, and most importantly the host will be so much more helpful thatn an impersonal anti-chinese hotel chain. The good points? The artificial hotspring on the basement was good, the beds were soft and comfy, the rooms and facilities seem clean. Not too far from the station. But at the end of it, that anti-chinese war propaganda booklet made what would have been a passably pleasant stay, a bad experience. My partner said I should never stay at APA hotels again because now that we know they are pandering to such propaganda, how can we or ANYONE support such ideology or support the politicisation of a commercial hotel business for international travellers by staying at any APA hotel chain?","Singapore, Singapore","infrarouge</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",145,1.0

Location is pretty decent- close to Shinjuku (~10 min walk) and about 100ft from a red line Tokyo Metro stop.Arrived at Haneda airport at 6am and it took almost two hours and two transfers to get to the hotel by train. We weren't able to check in that early, but the hotel offered to let us leave bags in the lobby until check-in, and recognized the 2hr early check-in as offered by our online travel agency. It happened to be raining upon arrival and one of the front desk representatives went in back, and brought out umbrellas for us to use- very appreciated!When we got back in the early afternoon, check-in was pretty straight forward. You stop by the front desk where they ask to take a scan of your passports, then are handed a single keycard. To complete check-in, you have to turn around and used one of the kiosks to complete payment and receive activated room keys. The kiosk had no problem with our USA based VISA.The elevators are reasonably large, and require the keycard to call from the lobby. The only strange thing to note about the hotel is that while the lobby is inside, the atrium of each floor level is open to the sky, so the 'interior corridors' are really just outdoors. Did not particularly bother us as there were heaters in the hallway, but seemed a bit strange as it was 'raining' inside.The room we had was a 'Double'. It was not overly large, but was reasonably large enough for two people and a moderate amount of luggage. The bathroom was decent sized, but the tub was very difficult to step into due to the height of it, and the way the tub is designed let water flow all over the bathroom while showering. Amenities (comb, toothbrushes, cotton swabs, ect..) were very well stocked.Overall the room was pretty comfortable. The bed was nice, and sheets/pillows appeared high quality. I was most disappointed by the outlet placement/number. There was one outlet at the desk, one above the bed, one in the bathroom, and one for the air purifier (one plug at each outlet). I could have appreciated 1-2 more at the desk. I had seen the comments on AC/heat before staying at the hotel, and by mid-October it seemed like the AC had been turned off already. While it was still pretty warm in the room, leaving the window open (the 1-2"" that it would move) made it very comfortable.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","BlueEngineer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",10,4.0

Two of us could still fit in comfortably with a small double, a desk with chair, large tv, shower/toilet/bath ensuite and a large and a medium suitcase. Most importantly, the room was clean and the little well-thought-out touches made our stay really comfortable if you appreciate that sort of thing.They provide robes, slippers, shampoo, conditioner, body wash and an amazing array of other toiletries; toothbrushes/toothpaste, HAIR BANDS (lifesaver if you have long hair), razors with shaving cream, combs....these are replaced daily if you have used, along with fresh towels & robes.I think the bed sheets are changed every 3 days, although the bed is made everyday! Unfortunately, I was unwell on the 3rd day when this was meant to happen and spent most of the day in bed. The cleaner read the ""do not disturb sign"" and left fresh towels, robes and toiletries in a bag outside the door - so sweet! They were also lovely when you bumped into them in the mornings.The ""public"" baths in the basement are awesome! We waited until the second last day to try them even though it was in the back of our minds from the beginning that we wanted to give them go. I think we were a bit apprehensive at first being from London- we don't normally sit naked in a hot bath with a load of other naked strangers! Don't wait until the end to try because as someone else said below; it is absolutely perfect to do after a long day of being out and about in enormous Tokyo. It's so dim and steamy down there it's perfect for having a soak. Open-plan showering cubicles with a stool, mirror and toiletries are provided so that you can wash yourself beforehand.I can't comment on the hotel breakfast or food as we didn't have any. We preferred to go to coffee shops and get pastries for breakfast; saving our money to try some of the many amazing ramen places every evening.The hotel is near to two metro stations on either side of it and is situated within one of the busiest, liveliest districts in Tokyo where there is a lot happening. To get to the main Shinjuku trainmen (not the metro) it is a 15-20 minute walk. The hotel is also on one of the quiter roads within Shinjuku so that you can get some sleep (if you want to!).The hotel politely hold your luggage for you upon check-out (not sure for how long maximum, as we only needed an hour) which is a really kind gesture as although most hotels will do this, I have never seen every guest using this service before and the lobby was full of suitcases at 11am- they could have easily say no! Great customer service, thank you.I hope that one day I can come back to Japan and I would definitely stay at this APA again or try another branch because of this first experience.

It's also very well-located - there are cafes and restaurants nearby if you don't want to use the hotel facilities, and a minute's walk from the Tokyo Metro (Marunouchi line). The park is also just behind the hotel, and it's a great place to wind down from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Do note that as this is not a luxury hotel - the rooms are VERY small and hence the hotel is better suited for travellers with no children. There's barely room to keep one big suitcase on hand. The hotel also has a particular quirk of requiring that all services be paid upfront - no charges to the room are accepted. You pay for your stay in full immediately on arrival. I did not purchase a meal ticket with my stay and was obliged to pay for my breakfast prior to having my meal, as the restaurant would not charge the meal to my room. This was unsettling, and a few fellow travellers were rather dismayed at this policy.Stay here if you are a single traveller who does not need a lot of perks and extra services - the location and other food choices around the hotel more than compensates. It's also easy enough to get to the airport - taxis are available to bring you to the Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal, and vice versa. However, if you have children, you may wish to reconsider. This is completely unrelated to the services provided by the hotel, but pls note that the owner of the APA chain has been embroiled in political controversies before (it is easy enough to google).

I stayed for three weeks in Japan and flew in through Tokyo. It's not easy behind your computer back home to pick a place in a metropole like Tokyo is. This hotel was an excellent choice. It is close to Shinjuku station, which is one of Tokyo's busiest stations with 3 million passengers each day. The NEX (Narita Airline Express) runs to this station. If you've exchanged your JPR at Narita Airport you can use your JPR. I activated my JPR after my five nights in Tokyo and paid about 3000Y for this fair. There are cheaper options but this is a comfortable direct option which is convenient after a long flight. It's a short walk to the hotel. Or change at the Subway to Shinjuku Gyoenmae Station, then it's just across the street. The hotel is right next to the Gyoenmae park which I can definitely recommend to visit. During my trip I found out the quality of APA hotels in Japan differ. I had some bad ones too unfortunately. This is one of the newer ones and is excellent. I was just by myself and had a single room. The rooms are smaller in Japan, so if you need your space or if you're a couple think about upgrading. The rooms have everything you need. There are many amenities and the general level of cleanliness in Japan is really good. Housekeeping service during my stay was flawless. I paid about 240€ for 3 nights, which is not bad for Tokyo rates. I picked this to relax the first nights after my stay. Walk around Shinjuku, you'll be amazed. Don't talk back to the guys who try to pull you into bars. Buy a suica or pasmo card and use Tokyos subway to get around.

I was pleasantly surprised by how luxurious it was. Yes, the room is small, as are almost all rooms in Tokyo, but once you adjust to that, it's quite a special experience. Each room has a flat screen TV with the sharpest picture I have ever seen on any hotel TV in my life and about a dozen channels. There is a desk, pairs of permanent as well as disposable slippers, bathrobes, coffee, tea, creamer, hair dryer, and a mini fridge. In addition, amenities are replaced daily: toothbrush, razor, hair brush, shower cap, q tips, body sponge, etc. The bathroom in the room has a built in bidet in the toilet with three different spray options and a range of water pressure choices as well. There are laundry machines in the basement, coin operated, and 24 hour lobby service and entrance. For security purposes, a key is required to operate the elevator as well as to enter the rooms but you can come and go 24/7. A free daily Japan Times newspaper is offered in the lobby. The biggest amenity, however, is the public baths in the basement, nudity required, with separate facilities for each gender, open to all guests each morning and night. The property is one block from a subway stop. The only negative I can cite is that although the web page listed late checkout as a ""free amenity"" provided in the cost of the room, the front desk insisted that was not true and pointed to a sign there which says late checkout costs 1,000 Japanese yen per hour (up to 3 hours maximum, or 2 PM). There was also a language barrier as the staff really does not speak English, but in my opinion it is not possible for worldwide hotel staff to speak every guest's language so I do not fault them for that. By the way an earlier post said that upon checking in each guest receives a free snack--that policy has been discontinued apparently, as the front desk advised me they no longer do that. Overall, housekeeping was excellent and staff was helpful, if a bit aloof at times. This hotel is a good choice and, in my opinion, a bargain for what they offer and for the convenient location.","Fort Lauderdale, Florida","Pedro L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</strong>",27,4.0

I choose this particular one as it is new and had an outdoor bath. I went to the main line station and it's quite a walk to the hotel, along a dull dual carriageway which made the walk even more painful. Suggest going to the subway station which begins with S and is the name of this hotel. That is right under the building.The check in was smooth though a bit odd, you check in with a real person and they give you a key card and you have to check in with a machine around the corner that gives you your room number. Room was small but clean and comfortable with high quality freebies. The comunal bath was very nice they even have these huge ceramic flower pots you can bath in. When they say outdoor bath it's pushing the boat out a bit yes it is out door but under all the Aircon and roof top plumbing equipment. As in you can't see anything if it rains you might get wet. I did not try the food so can't comment. What let's it down is the location there is nothing around it. A petrol station and two restaurants. The more interesting places are only a few stops away on the underground. I would stay again purely from the value point of view. A clean pleasant new hotel.

I really liked the heated mirror that didn't fog up while showering. My only complaints are:1) The room is laid out so strangely. You only get a small aisle to walk in. There's a space at the end of the bed for the suitcase, but there's a corner wall notch that makes it hard to work with. If they'd put the bed in this little nook instead, there would be a better use of floor space! Also, the desk had a TV on it. If it were mounted on the wall, you'd have more desk space to stick things. It was a bit cramped. Not enough to ruin the experience, but enough to make you wonder why they didn't move the bed. I think it's simply because the bed has an electric headboard with lights + outlets, and it's sharing a circuit with the bathroom. If they put it on the other side, they wouldn't be able to do that. Oh well. If you stay here, don't bring a big suitcase. (If you're staying for about 3 weeks like we did, this part is difficult)2) There are only 2 washers and 2 dryers. It's a big hotel.

There's a bunch of great little restaurants and ramen places within steps of the hotel and multiple stores (7-11, Family Mart) around too. It's right beside the Shinjuku Gyoen garden. It's just outside all the action, which we liked because it has a quieter vibe than if you were to stay in Kabukicho. Rooms: Rooms are tiny! We stayed for 9 days, so it was tough because there's no closet and we had to keep everything in the suitcase. We did expect this considering that it is Tokyo and the price we paid. If you're used to North American sized rooms, you'll be in for a shock. The bathroom is very small also but both the room and bathroom are clean.

The room can get pretty hot and stuffy but the AC is quick to cool it down. We didn't eat at the restaurant because we didn't think it was worth the price. We chose to eat from the 7-11 when we were up early. Daily made sandwiches and other fresh foods and ramen bowls. There's a Freshness burger place that opens up at 7am that is really good, if you're into a burger for breakfast and a 24hr cafe type place that has breakfast too. There's also a small grocery store just down the block, which is cheaper than the convenient stores but it's not open 24hrs. There is a spa but we never ended up using it. I have tattoos and there is a sign about guests with tattoos so I didn't bother.Overall, our stay was very pleasant. The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly.

I disagree with some of the negative comments about the staff, I found them polite even a little shy, maybe because they don't speak English confidently. the location is convenient for tourist and business persons alike, close to the subway and a 15 minute walk from the main Shinjuku station. There are plenty of places to eat and drink nearby and the area is very safe for tourists including families and solo travelers. For a central Tokyo hotel the price was reasonable.Overall a clean new hotel with good facilities in the price range that I would use again.","Nottingham, United Kingdom","Jeremy E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nottingham, United Kingdom</strong>",13,4.0

APA Hotel in Shinjuku-Gyonmae fits the bill to a T. It may have bigger rooms, I don't know, but for solo traveller like me, I was just looking for 1 single room.The room was very small, as expected. But amazingly compact in design and complete. This is Japanese efficiency of putting everything together in such a small space. I had a study table, a mini ref, a hospitality coffee and tea, and a giant flat screen TV (this was the only big thing)! The toilet was also amazingly compact, but well designed to fit everything you would need, including automatic bidet and nice hot shower. The toilet seemed like a pre-fabricated module plug into the room, and was spotlessly clean! As a single traveller, the small space is really just enough for one to move around, but who cares, I just need a place to sleep and shower. And I must say, the bed quality and duvet was superb--super soft, although the pillows were flat (Japanese style?). It also had an aircon so I switched it on so it doesn't get so stuffy. The reading lights and switches were also well located in such a small space. And must I say that the wifi was super fast! The location is also just less than 5 mins. walk to Shinjuku-Gyonmae subway (Maranouchi Line) which connects to Shinjuku main station (2 stops away) where you can connect to so many trains. Around the area is quite New Yorkish (quiet side) with Choco croque, Tully's Cafe, Freshness Burger, Coco Ichibanya, many Family Marts and 7-11's, and a big nice park behind. Very safe and clean neighbourhood. I didn't book for breakfast, as it was easy to eat out.It also has a free sauna and spa at the lower basement in case you want to use. I just took a look. It was a small but very clean. Hotel is quite new, it seems, and actually is a tall hotel, seemingly a business hotel for Japanese businessmen or salarymen, but also catering to tourists. Lobby is nice and decent, and check in was fast and efficient. This hotel would definitely be my go to hotel next time I go to Tokyo.","Metro Manila, Philippines","alexohph</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Metro Manila, Philippines</strong>",87,5.0

We rented a double room for a week... and we came with a week's worth of clothes. The room fit 2 single beds (each pushed against the opposite walls). This left about 18"" left between the beds (no room for nightstands). At the foot of the beds was a builtin desk unit that had a small desk, the trash cans, a coffee maker and a refrigerator. Again, the distance between the foot of the bed and the desk unit was about 18"". The only available space to fit a suitcase is blocking the door. In order to enter the door, one must first move the suitcase into the 18"" gap between the beds, then open the door, then sneeze by the suitcase to get it back in front of the door. Okay, so you're thinking it's a bit tight... but that would be an understatement... there is no closet in the room so if you want something from your suitcase, then you must again guide the suitcase between the 18"" gap between the beds and then put the suitcase on the bed in order to open it. Once you get your article of clothing from your suitcase, you must then re-close the suitcase and again guide it to the only available floor space (in front of the room door). This gets old really quickly especially when you are headed out and realize you need a sweater (from your suitcase). Renting a room without a closet, even a small closet, should be illegal and, at a minimum, should not be an adult hotel room. To solve the problem, we ended up renting a 2nd room across the hall. This way we could leave our suitcases open on the bed in the second room and simply use the 2nd room as a changing room. The bathrooms are sized accordingly... if you're a VERY small person you can take a shower semi-comfortably... if not, forget it. Ditto for sitting on the toilet. The newest fashion (at least in the US) is ""tiny houses""... if you are a ""tiny house"" lover, then this is your place. If you just want a comfortable, reasonably sized room to sleep... there are better choices. We do want to point out that after 3 nights in the room, we were lucky enough to be able to move to the only deluxe room in the hotel (on the top floor) were there was a tiny closet, but at least we could consolidate our 2 rooms into one (with enough floor space to store and open the suitcases).","Fort Lauderdale, Florida","BobAndSatoshi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</strong>",59,1.0

It's a spa hotel because there is a hot mineral bath included. Limited English is spoken by most of the staff as we noticed most were trainees when we checked in. Given that my wife speaks Japanese, we cannot comment on the poor service mentioned by others. Generally, it's easy to flag down a taxi on the street. Just don't expect 4 star hotel service when you're paying for 2.5 star. Japan is a very structured society so don't expect them to conform to foreign customs. A 15 minute brisk walk gets you to Shinjuku Station and shopping. Drink vending machine, ice machine, coin laundry, microwave and the spa are all located in the basement. Elevator access to the rooms is secured by your room card. The room is really compact at 11 sq.m. or 118 s.f.! Some may find it too claustrophobic! It's acceptable for a single person but for two, we would not stay anymore than a couple of nights. The amenities include fridge, kettle, A/Cond, humidifier, strong WIFI, BBC News in English. Our only complaint besides feeling like sardines, is the flat pillows and soft mattress like I was sleeping on a water bed. The Family Mart convenience store is across the street and to the east at the crosswalk.The hot bath spa is Japanese style so you need to observe the Japanese etiquette of no tattoos allowed (cultural issue), removing your footwear at the entrance, put all your clothes and bath towel in the basket in the change room (valuables can be put into the self locking lockers but please reset the combination back to 0-0-0-0 after use), enter the hot bath area and completely wash yourself in the washing stall and finally rinse yourself using the scoop before entering the pool. We're told that the bath water is mineralized and the temperature is about 39C. There's also an outdoor bath area. After leaving the hot bath, a quick shower is recommended to cool off. For a different lunch experience, you can try the gyoza eatery right across the street from the hotel. English menu is available. for Y590, you can enjoy a hearty set lunch which includes two choices of six gyoza each (we chose 6 fried with garlic and 6 boiled with garlic), seaweed broth and bowl of rice. They serve beer but i chose non-alcoholic beer for Y380. To keep it light, we shared that and an appetizer of fried burdock for Y290. That left us room for afternoon tea at the Takashimaya Dept.

Also, it’s about a 10 minutes walk from the Shinjuku station.Room:We were expecting the room to be small but it was smaller than we anticipated.

(Cultural issue so we respect that)Customer Service:There is absolutely no early check-in so just drop off your luggages and come back after 3 pm. Half of the staff at the front desk do not speak English and they refuse to do any service for you. My wife wanted them to simply make a call and interpret for us but the front desk refused to do so and their explaination was the receiver isn’t the same company as they are. We were furious about that as we are only asking them to be the translator. Another simple service that we asked was calling for a taxi in advance as we were leaving to the airport in the early morning. However, the front desk staff refused to call and said we can just walk out to the entrance and look for one. To be honest, I never been to any hotel in advance cities that would refuse to call us a cab. I m not sure if it was a cultural thing or the cab company wasn’t the same company as they are so they can perform such service.Conclusion:We will never stay at this hotel chain again due to their horrible service.

It looks stylish and modern on the exterior but has a small lobby and very small guest rooms. It was suitable for single travellers like myself who stayed for less than a week. There is no concierge or bell boy service available at this hotel. This means that you have to lug your own luggage up to your own room. One or two counter staff can speak and understand English well so it is a good thing as I really had problems trying to communicate with other counter staff. They were friendly and polite but had a weaker proficiency with English. The twin-share room I had was clean and well stocked with all toiletries. There is no wardrobe in the room, only 3 hooks on the wall for hanging your clothes. So I was literally living out of my suitcase for the 4 days that I was there. The bathroom basin tap and the shower tap are the same tap (because of space constraints) which is quite ingenious because it is both space-saving and technologically savvy. Get a room away from the lift lobby because it can get a little noisy. However, you may wish to note that the corridors are not well lit if you choose a room further away from the lift lobby. An upside is that the hotel employs English-speaking housekeeping staff from Nepal (yea, surprise surprise) who are helpful and friendly. I requested housekeeping not to clean my room on a certain day but when I returned back to the hotel late at night, housekeeping had left a bag full of new towels and toiletries for my use at my room door! It was a pleasant surprise to end an otherwise tiring work day.Breakfast at the hotel came with the hotel package (it would otherwise cost 1800 yen per person I think). It was a comprehensive Japanese breakfast buffet spread with rice, porridge, fruits, salad and some assorted miso, soba, meat and vegetable items to go with the carbs. There were buns as well but no live station (e.g. omelette station). You drop your breakfast coupon into a rattan basket placed at the entrance and then you are free to go find your own table and do your own stuff. There is only one waiter who will clear your table after you leave, so you may have a table full of plates at the end of your meal if you go on multiple trips to the buffet line. I like it that the hotel is located beside Freshness Burger, is opposite a couple of yakitori places, near a local supermarket, a 7-11 convenience store and a 100-yen shop. Most importantly, it is within walking distance (1 minute walk) to the Shinjuku-Gyoename train station! :)",Singapore,"Adelyn T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",7,4.0

It is a small hotel without a concierge and porters, but the reception counter is always well-staffed with at least 3 staff. Although the English proficiency of each counter staff varies, they try their best to help their customers. For myself, I took a few tries to be clear on what I needed from them and also made sure that they could understand my requests. Check-in is at 3pm. Any earlier, you'd have to enquire at the counter to see if there are any rooms available and be prepared to pay additional $$ for the early check-in.Check-out is at 11am. It would be good to head downstairs earlier for check-out because the reception counter area is small and would not accommodate many large luggage with crowds. I stayed in a double room for 3 nights and it was comfortable and clean. There was a spray bottle of antiseptic which guests could use to disinfect any surfaces in the room. I found this useful and was surprised that there was virtually no speck of dust when I wiped the surfaces. When I ran into the housekeeper (a Nepalese man) the next morning, I asked if he could come to clear the rubbish in my room first as I was heading out. He willingly agreed and asked me what items I needed in my room so that he could top up for me. After cleaning up, he used a system wired into the room's plasma tv to update that he had cleaned the room. I was quite amazed with the technology used! I was pleasantly surprised to find a bag of new towels and toiletries set outside my room when I returned back late from a day of meetings. It turned out that the housekeeper did not enter my room as I had left the Do not Disturb sign on but he was kind enough to leave me spare towels and toiletries in case I needed a change. I think their housekeeping staff have done a great job! The pillows were a bit too hard and thin for my liking but I managed to stack 2 bath robes and 2 pillows together to make a new pillow for myself. This is manageable and not a big issue as everyone's pillow preferences differs. The quilt was very comfortable and warm. I could not really figure out the air-con and heater in the room but felt that the room was cool enough to sleep in without the heater turned on. At 18 degrees Celsius, the fall weather was comfortable. The heater is good for drying my towel and clothes worn for the day before, so that I could fold and pack them nicely back into my suitcase. Buffet breakfast was sumptuous with Japanese fare and some western food items like cornflakes and sausages. I had a good fill every morning though I think the fresh fruit selection could be improved. The waiter was polite and did not clear anything from my table until I was done with my meal. Even though my colleagues had finished earlier and left before me, the waiter waited patiently for me to finish before clearing everything on the table. The hotel is conveniently located near the Shinjuku-Gyoenmae train station and 7-11 is conveniently located in a minute's walk down the road. Freshness Burger is located just beside the hotel. Lawson's and Family Mart are nearby as well. There is also a supermarket (with a basement) that sells more fresh vegetables and fruits.",Singapore,"Adelyn T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",7,4.0

The hotel is new and in great shape. It's very Japanese so you need to be ready for that, in spades. Provided you are, it is in fact a very nice place. It's only real drawbacks are size (it really is tiny) and the rather quiet and farther out location is a good 10-15 minute walk to Shinjuku station. o There is a nice onsen in the basement, which is free (unusual in Japan where there's typically a small charge for just about anything). It isn't big (shocker) and gets heavy use during peak times, so it can be a little crowded. Nice Japanese touch though.o About 80% of their guests are Japanese and the rest, other Asian. I saw zero European or other flavour guests during our stay.o The standard of English of the front desk is better than I had expected, but not as good as larger Japanese hotels in busier districts. It was certainly adequate to basic hotel tasks like checking in and getting another pillow, though. o It is about a 15 minute walk from Shinjuku JR into a residential neighborhood, but the area still has a bunch of nice restaurants and a lot of convenience stores too. It's not smack in Kabuki-cho in other words, but you still have everything basic you need around it. The nearest Subway line station is Shinjuku-Gyoenmae, which is like 2 mins in the other direction and would be very convenient except that line doesn't actually go anywhere. o This hotel is BUSY. The lobby is small, and mobbed. Check in and out was efficient but there were still at least 10 people in line all the time. o The rooms are TINY. Very nice, with excellent sheets, towels, bedding, etc. But the smallest I have ever stayed in. The double is about 150 sq ft, not more. For two people to sleep, you have to be in an embrace all night, more or less. If you are two sharing the room, I would say if you have a combined waist measurement for the two of you of more than 65"", forget it. Seriously. Or large luggage x 2. One big bag and one small is as much as you can do. 2 large bags would be impossible. For a single person it would be ideal, unless you're Yao Ming or something. o The bathroom is small but for some reason is not a problem. Everything works out nicely, even a deep soaking tub, oddly. But the smallness of the bedroom really broods for two. o TV is predictably Japanese only. Great wifi, free fast and no palaver. Simple login. Unlimited devices.o Very odd pillows are standard. Kind of like one of those sponges for dish-washing that have a mesh over foam rubber. XL size, thin. Unusable for sleep. They will change them for better ones though if you ask and are willing to endure a bit of a palaver. o Window actually opens, which was nice in a Japanese winter to offset the nuclear heating. o The price is reasonable at about a third cheaper than our usual large hotels right on the stations. I would guess out of season you can probably get it for about ¥12-15k or so, which would be great value. I would stay here again if alone and on business. The appointments are in fact better then the other 3 large central hotels we usually use. It is only the rather remote location and the microscopic rooms that deter.",Hong Kong,"HKguy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong</strong>",181,4.0

I don't understand why other people give this hotel a good review. It was the worst service I ever recieved and I didnt expect this service from a hotel in Japan, by the way we paid 400 US during our stay at the new year. So it wasn't cheap.

In the middle of Shinjuku area, this is a good find and I loved it. It's cost performance is reasonable, too. Very close to Shinjuku Gyoen so you can just pop around to see this wonderful park. You can walk to stations within 10 minutes. If you are foreign and wanting to use Japanese spa, then please please please respect their local culture by learning the rules of how to take bath and how to behave: it has been really putting off Japanese people when foreigners are not respecting the local culture. Bathing area is where the Japanese come to relax, not expecting people talking loud and dominating the atmosphere.","London, United Kingdom","Enjoydifference</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",234,5.0

And this is it, the apa hotel shunjuku gyoenmae is 1minute walk from the metro exit, along a big street hard to miss.2. small rooms. I am sorry, rooms will be small unless you are prepared to pay 3-400USD/night, or in a location that is so off-center you waste time commuting. so yes, the apa-hotel has standard tokyo citycenter room size, once you open your luggage there will be no room to stand. However that is ""normal"" in this location. For a bigger room, try Hilton, Hyatt, Sheraton, but they are all at painful locations, locations where it is painful to walk, but ridiculous to get on a cab. For big rooms right in front of an accessible station, try Shangri-la Tokyo right at the door of Tokyo Tokyo station.3. an average bed in an average Japanese hotel is hard. some people grew up with it and are fine. I am not. for a Sealy mattress, you will have to go for SPG group... or the APA group! for SImmons, you will have to go for other expensive options. so I have to say that the mattress at APA hotel is the best bed for this price. other similar options include Super Hotel (not very good locations for Tokyo, unless Chiba)4. tiny bathrooms. sorry the bathroom is tiny, all plastic, earthquake-proof; but the tub is slightly modified, and managed to fit a 5'9"" guy weighing 225lbs reasonably well5. language problem. the staff here had no problem with English. and the checkout was automatic, just like a train ticket vending machine.6. wanting to try an onsen but donn't know how and where. well, there is an artificial onsen right at the basement of the hotel, don't know the how-to's? ask a staff.All in all, I am very happy with the stay at APA hotel, and would highly recommend this.",Hong Kong,"xumdeo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong</strong>",19,5.0

Booked the single room to save money and it was indeed tiny room, albeit with a double bed. No room for a suitcase, no iron in the hotel at all so a little problematic to get the wrinkles out of the shirts for work. Capsule like bathroom and average breakfast, but it was spotless and comfy bed. Definitely targeted to the Japanese market so little English spoken and TV instructions all in Japanese. However as I said, it's fine for a couple of nights and somewhere to put your head down at a decent price for the area. Handy to metro station and loads of bars and restaurants in the area.

Three of us stayed here and all agreed that it was more of a 4 star hotel than the 3 stars that its sold as. It opened in July and everything is still new and spotless. We booked single rooms which were pretty much as expected - not large rooms but ideal for one person - and with great facilities i.e. mini-fridge, heater (not needed), adjustable air-con, free wi-fi in the room, beautiful comfortable bed although the pillows took a bit of getting used to. For the Sat - Tues period we paid a total of Yen 46,000 - about £65 per night which included a hot and cold buffet breakfast (English and Japanese food) and access to the spa. The hotel is easy to get to from Narita airport - just get the Narita Express (N'Ex) to Shinjuku from the airport for Yen 1500 (Yen 3000 for the return journey). The journey takes about 80 minutes. Shinjuku, Shinjuku-Sanchome and Shinjuku-Gyoemmae stations / metro stops are all close with the latter only two minutes walk from the hotel. Around the hotel are a multitude of shops, department stores, restaurants and bars. Hotel staff - and everyone we met in Tokyo - were all very friendly and eager to help. Their level of English varies but far exceeds my Japanese! Most places used english as a second language. The metro has signs and announcements in both Japanese and English. The area appeared safe and we noticed that locals left handbags and cameras unattended on tables. Beware in Kabukicho of following touts into bars as these can be a complete rip-off. This is a great hotel and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there and would defintely use it again. There's loads to do in Shinjuku and its easy enough to get to Shibuya, or the centre of Tokyo within 30 minutes by metro.","Horsham, United Kingdom","555markus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Horsham, United Kingdom</strong>",10,5.0
