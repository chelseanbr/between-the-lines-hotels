When we went to our rooms we realised they had an interconnecting door. I went to reception to request the opening of the door as a special handle was needed. My initial request was met with ‘no we are sorry we cannot do this’. When I asked why I was told because we hadn’t booked interconnected rooms?! I then politely engaged in further conversation explaining that this would be extremely convenient for our family and they did end up doing so but told me next time I must request it in our booking.

The hotel sent out clear instructions showing how to catch their shuttle bus, and with typical Japanese efficiency we were going down the escalator to the bus stop 30secs after a bus was due to leave and of course we could then see the bus pulling off! Make sure you get the right shuttle bus as there are two MyStays hotels with shuttles from the airport.The hotel is just outside the airport area and depending which terminal you board the bus from, it will be 10-20mins to get to the hotel from the airport. Check in was efficient and trouble free, and we were allocated a room at the rear of the ground floor, just opposite the laundry room. This meant the room was towards the rear of the hotel but overlooking the quieter side street rather than the main road at the front. The room felt relatively spacious for a Japanese hotel and had an unusual arrangement of a desk area acting as the headboard for the bed, creating two separate areas to the room. We appreciated that TV had a few international channels, and there were bedside power outlets to charge our phones. Typical ""plastic pod"" bathroom.We had ordered a pre-paid SIM card and had this sent to the MyStays hotel; I had forgotten to ask about this at check-in, but we found the envelope neatly arranged on the desk. Japanese efficiency!We didn't eat in the hotel resturant, but there was a 24hr noodle bar just a block or so down the street with English menus (turn left out the front door), and of course an obligatory convenience store.Suffering from jetlag, we had an early monring stroll around the few streets just behind the hotel and there's a nice enough shrine you can spend a few minutes looking around, even though it wasn't open when we were there. There's also the local train station on the branch line going to the airport.The shuttle back to the airport was trouble free.

We took the shuttle to the airport the next day and from there we took a direct bus to Mt. Fuji for a day trip - absolutely loved our day!There are restaurants close by. It was quite a challenge to find something vegetarian but when we walked passed one restaurant in the back street, the owner came out and told me that she will cook anything they have on the menu, but with vegetables, instead of meat - she was great!As the shuttle does not run from the Hotel to the Airport in the evening, we had to take a taxi. The cost was 1300 yen. I would suggest that they provide the shuttle to the airport in the evening also as many flights leave Haneda airport around midnight.

The bathroom had the usual shampoo, conditioner and body wash and even toothbrush and toothpaste. The beds were very comfortable, though the pillows were a little on the hard side. For just one night, this was not a big deal. There is a restaurant in the lobby, but we did not use it. If you want to travel into town, there is a train station that is literally around the corner from the hotel so that was very convenient too since uber was approx $75-100 depending on the time of day from Ota to Shibuya. The trains maps are a bit daunting, but with a little patience and a little asking of the station staff... who are also very helpful.... we made it into and back from Shibuya quite easily.

The information ladies in the international terminal told us they did not pick up passengers at that international terminal so we took the free shuttle to the domestic terminal to catch the hotel shuttle there. But when we left the hotel the shuttle bus dropped off passengers at the international terminal. Confusing.The hotel itself was clean and modern plus the desk staff were helpful and polite. The rooms were nice but small by western standards so be prepared. If you want western sized rooms in Tokyo be prepared to spend big bucks! The room itself was immaculate and stylish but the reason I didn't give the hotel 5 stars was the bathroom. It was functional but smelled musty, which wasn't too bad if you left the fan on. I think the problem is that there is an unsealed gap between the wall and the bathtub that can trap water and create mold/smells. Nothing a bead of silicone sealant can't fix.There are plenty of convenience stores and shops in the neighborhood to buy snacks and refreshments.

Were given a room facing the road but the room was quiet, perhaps good sound proofing at wok here.The hotel's restaurant was closed so we went to a nearby convenient shop to buy dinner. Next day, breakfast was not too bad. We took a free shuttle bus from hotel to Haneda International Terminal to take our LimoBus to go to Hakone via Shinjuku Station. Didn't want to board the busy Tokyo train with the morning rush hour crowd with 2 luggage and 2 kids in tow. Overall we are happy with our stay in this hotel for 1 night.","London, United Kingdom","220ahmadi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",12,5.0

The room had a weird damp/rot smell whenever we opened the window though. The air-conditioning unit didn't seem to work unfortunately. The layout of the room is really weird. Like a long corridor wirh the bed at the end facing a window. There's a big TV in the room but it doesn't face the bed. Not really sure of the logic behind that but luckily we had an iPad with us anyway. Wifi connection is good. We realised that if we'd booked the room on the night we would have saved £25 so that was a bit annoying. Can't comment on the food as the reviews of the restuarant put us off eating there.

The hotel has a free shuttle from Haneda which operates late into the evening, and seeing as I was getting in after 11pm, this was a great way to save some money to get to where I needed to stay. There is a timetable and information on where to get the shuttle directly on their website which is a major plus. The hotel is pretty basic, but seems to be new/renovated. The lobby has a low ceiling but is bright and features a nice looking cafe/restaurant attached to it.Check-In was quick and efficient, although the clerk serving me was pretty stoic. Not unfriendly, but just...stoic. I tried to request a late checkout but he informed me that every hour over the checkout time of 11am would be an additional 2,000 yen (as is fairly standard for hotels in Japan as I have discovered; it's rare to get complimentary late checkouts). No apology that there was a charge, or remorse, just very matter of fact stoicism devoid of personality. Not the end of the world but it would have been nice to see a bit more of a smiley and friendly personality. I booked their lowest category/smallest room as I was really only staying here for a grand total of 12 hours. The room was definitely more narrow than your standard hotel room, but was a lot ""longer."" There was a water closet/shower room right after walking in, followed by the double bed nestled nicely in the corner closest to the door. Beyond that was a sitting area that faces the desk and TV's. The room actually felt perfectly spacious and comfortable for one person despite it being their smallest room. It would also be perfectly adequate for two people, particularly if staying just for a night. The shower and water closet was very clean, and the water pressure and amenities were perfectly good. The bed was comfortable and I got a really solid nights sleep. AirCon in the room, and cleanliness were top notch at this hotel. My only regret was not staying here a bit longer. The location isn't great if you're trying to explore Tokyo, its a pretty significant trek to get into the city but there is a subway station just around the corner from the hotel so the ride in to the city is manageable and for the price point it is considerably less than city center hotels of equal or comparable value I found. One of the best things about this hotel though is that you book rooms directly as either smoking or non-smoking: there's no requesting a smoking/non-smoking room as they segregate this in the reservations process, and, appeared to separate the floors accordingly too. If you're allergic to cigarette smoke like me, you'll love this hotel.

I don't have any photo evidence, so take from this what you will. I personally had a bad experience but that may not represent other customers views.When we arrived we were earlier than the check in time (3pm) which was fine so we explored the area a bit. After checking in we went to our room it wasn't very clean at all; there were dead flies stuck to the ceiling of the bathroom and there were some white kinda crusty stains on the over sheet thing on top of the bed. There was also a couple of spiders in the room, which can't be helped but they were very difficult to catch as they jumped (perhaps something to be wary of in this area). Also the room was not very sound proof, so we could hear what was going on in the corridors outside, so I didn't get much sleep as people were constantly coming and going. However the room was very comfortable and was well equipped as well as being spacious.We checked out the next morning and took the shuttle bus. The checking out process was quick and easy and the shuttle bus was very handy, especially at 4am.However we got to the airport and our flight was delayed by 24 hours, British Airlines were completely unhelpful and just told us to sort ourselves out, so we reluctantly booked another night there.We arrived back at the hotel at 8am, as we knew that the check in time was at 3 pm, we just waited at the lobby as we were tired and didn't want to walk around. At around 11am staff began checking in guests, however when I asked to check in early they told us we had to wait, so I was annoyed but I understood that there may have been special circumstances. But the staff continued to check in other people and when I asked again to check in early and they told me that I had to pay 2,000JPY per hour that I checked in early. I speak Japanese and had been listening to the other people checking in and they had not mentioned it to any other guests, I was really annoyed and feel as though we are being treated unfairly.SUMMARYFood 4/5 The cafe is quite expensive but the food is niceStaff 2/5 Staff are not particularly helpful, although they do speak English, Japanese and ChineseFacilities 5/5 Rooms are well equipped and there is also a laundry areaCleanliness 1/5 Room was not up to standard and is one of the main reasons I rated the hotel very low, because it's a very basic thingOverall I had a poor experience and will never be returning to this hotel or any of the other Hotel MyStays","Cardiff, United Kingdom","dainty24</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cardiff, United Kingdom</strong>",1,1.0

The complimentary shuttle is easy to find from the HND terminals (there are good maps and schedules on the hotel's website).

The hotel is near the airport so it's a train ride into the more touristy areas of Tokyo - but when staying at a hotel near an airport for the convenience of the airport, that's expected. Local train station only 5 mins walk away and easy enough to get around. Get a Passmo card and you can load with cash and don't have to buy separate tickets all the time. My only downside of the hotel is that the airport shuttle only runs at really limited times a day (to airport in the morning and back from the airport evening). This isn't made obvious when booking - you have to dig around to find out. But you can get from Haneda to hotel by train. We learned all this the hard way lugging skis and duffel bags. Aargh!

Our return flight was for 12.30am and we were allowed to leave our bags with the reception whilst we ventured out for our final day. This was really helpful to us. The room we had was very satisfactory, with a toilet that was separate from the bathroom. The main space was modern and well laid out, with a good amount of space and amenities. There was room behind the entrance for luggage and a desk as well as a small seating area.* It would have been helpful to have the air con Instructions In English! I eventually somewhat figured It out.The area Is surprisingly close to Haneda airport. There Is a limited free hotel shuttle bus to and from the airport at certain times which we used upon arrival. However It does not run later In the evenings from the hotel so we took a taxi. Travel In Tokyo Is not cheap but the fare was not too much with the airport being close by. The train station Anamori-Inari Is nearby and trains go to the airport which Is another option available. There are a couple of 24hr mini markets very close by such as Familymart. However, If you want better prices and much more choice a couple of blocks behind Is a Fuji supermarket. The area Is quiet and residential but there are a few nearby places to eat out.Make sure to visit the small but charming shrine, Its a short distance behind the hotel.

Traditional Japanese slippers and pyjamas were provided and the toiletries in the ensuite were good quality, with extra items available free in Reception. The room itself was a reasonable size for Japan and was really well finished and equipped. Facilities included free wi-fi, a really practical desk and sofa, a fridge, tea/coffee making and plenty of power points and a good size comfortable bed.The staff were really friendly and even provided me a map of local convenience stores so I could pick up some food as I had arrived late.Breakfast in the morning was reasonable value and there was a good selection of Japanese and Western choices. It is great that it opens at 0500 so those people catching early flights still have time to eat.The only negative is the frequency of the hotel shuttle in the evening. I arrived at Haneda at 2200 and had to wait nearly 45 minutes for the minibus because it runs to a timetable rather than on demand. In the morning there was no such issue as the bus operated every 10-20 minutes.","Southampton, United Kingdom","RBuk25</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southampton, United Kingdom</strong>",16,5.0

There were no available hotel rooms in downtown Tokyo, and Mystays was close to the airport. We expected an average, so-so hotel. We were pleasantly surprised by this new facility and large room (by Japan's standards). The train station feeding into downtown Tokyo was a few minutes away, and there is a shrine just around the corner.If you arrive late or want to be near Haneda Airport, you will not be disappointed at Mystays Haneda.","Waimea, Hawaii","BigIsleFoodie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waimea, Hawaii</strong>",194,4.0

The hotel has a modern interior designs and nice Japanese standard bathroom equipments. The location, close to a few small fast food restaurants that opens late and about 10 minutes from the Haneda airport can not be beat. Price is about the same with the First class cabin style accomodation available at Haneda airport; which I had considered to stay at. The main difference is that you get more privacy and a bit more space at the Mystays Hotel Haneda than at the airport cabin. This hotel is definitely worth it!","New York City, New York","CharlesA767</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",33,4.0

This hotel was absolutely perfect for a late arrival or early morning departure from Tokyo International. The hotel is about a 10 minute (and $10 USD) cab ride if you miss the shuttle, so not bad at all. The next morning, we went back to the airport, via the free Hotel MyStays shuttle to catch the monorail and the the JR in to Shinjuku (make sure you buy your JR passes BEFORE you arrive in Tokyo). Tokyo central was about 50 minutes from the Haneda Airport. From the monorail, you have to transfer to the JR...it was really easy.The room was great, very NYC or San Francisco-esq. On the smallish side but the hotel is very new and there was not anything we were missing. WiFi in room was free, blow dryer, even pajamas on the bed when we walked in!! The MyStay has a restaurant in the lobby for breakfast - roughly $18 USD all you can eat buffet. We enjoyed it very much.The staff here was very helpful, many speak decent broken English....we had no problem figuring out what we needed to do. ARIGATO! If I ever have a late arrival or early departure again from Tokyo Haneda, I would absolutely stay here again.","Redondo Beach, California","MattE171</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redondo Beach, California</strong>",54,5.0

From the airport there is a free shuttle link every 10 past and 40 past the hour- but only from domestic terminals 1 & 2 if after 1pm. From International terminal, it is fairly easy to transfer to domestic terminals for free with terminal buses. There is a frequent shuttle service though in the AM from hotel to all terminals- see photo for times. In the immediate vicinity is a train station that can take you into Tokyo say to Shibuya in less than 1 hour. There is also many small Japanese restaurants and a Mcdonalds although that is about 20 minutes walk away. Lawsons and other mini marts though are within walking distance. Overall the area is quite nice.Room The room on the second floor was quite compact but cosy with a functional layout. As you enter you get a living room space with a small thin armchair with foot rest that faces a large TV. The TV is multifunctional with many movies in the ""room theatre"" mode costing about 1000Y for all. There is though some local and international TV such as CNN. As well as handy shuttle service and flight information screens. Although DVD was not present, noticed you can hire one. The room also had a large functional desk that backs off the bed posts. A lamp, phone, mini speakers, Pad, mirror & plenty of US plug slots are all on the desk. It a good size with a comfortable chair to work. This backs on to the queen sized bed quite firm but not uncomfortable- there are convenient dimming lamps either side of bed. Three kinds of pillow are offered, one of which is a memory foam ergonomic pillow. The room also offer s fridge, pyjamas, slippers, large safe, kettle and tea making facilities, portable luggage rack, open wardrobe with even clothes fragrance spray. Very functional room for an airport hotel but you cannot watch TV in bed, since the TV is behind the bed. The bathroom was typical of Japan, poky but functional offering a Japanese washlet, deep but small bath and shower on raised platform. All amenities are large bottles and quite nice products, dental kits is also offered. Overall the room was better than expected, there only thing for international travellers is the A/C unit is only in Japanese so found it hard to use when one cannot read Japanese. Considering they have very clear guides in English such as for WIFI, they should consider something helpful in English for AC unit as I found it cold and then fiddled about and the room became too hot. FacilitiesThe hotel has quite a good standard of facilities. Firstly WIFI is free and worked fast. There is a cafe/bar in the lobby but did not use, plenty of vending & ice machines on each floor. On the top floor is a small gym, the floor down is a 'Relaxing room"" with a few massage chairs and TV's but always occupied when I visited. There is also a laundry room, smoking room (room's are all non smoking) & meeting rooms. The whole hotel is absolutely spotlessly clean and modern. StaffStaff are very enthusiastic at this hotel, noticeably more welcoming than JAL hotel I stayed at previously which is across the street- even when you pop out they make effort to say 'welcome back' when you walk in lobby. Check-in and check out was very smooth and the shuttle service is extremely efficient with really professional staff that take pride in their roles. Overall I think this is one of the best hotels I have stayed at in Japan. I generally only have stayed at airport hotels but was very impressed and would certainly come here again on my next stay at Hanaeda.","London, England","doc d</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, England</strong>",473,5.0

Free Shuttle was nice and it was easy to find with the directions printed off the hotels website. Shuttle ride was about 10 minutes. The room was very clean and they had free wi-fi. Our luggage was lost so it was nice they had pjs to sleep in and a lot of available free toiletries (toothbrushes, combs, razors etc) in the lobby we could use. The hotel just opened September 2014. There were several areas to lounge in including a library and room with free massage chairs. English was easily understood.The breakfast buffet was decent the next morning and had a lot food options including fruit, cereal, rice, rice porridge, salad bar, many juice choices, coffee & tea etc.There isn't a lot near the hotel as far as tourist attractions. This is more of a good place to stay before or after a flight at Haneda.","Missoula, Montana","mirandium</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Missoula, Montana</strong>",20,5.0

It went beyond our expectations. We waited for the shuttle as instructed on their website (note: same area were airlines picked their crew. There is not a designated spot or sign for their shuttle but they parked at the end of the row and the driver asks around looking for guests). Check-in was easy and friendly. Rooms are new, impecably clean and even though they are small, they do have all you could need including nice speakers for your IPod/IPhone. The decoration was modern and minimalist (our fave style), pillows were perfect and it was really quiet, so we had a good rest. We didn't get breakfast there so I can't review that part. After checked out we walked to the train station a few blocks from there. A little hard to find since its in between small streets and also small station, but from there to Tokyo was a blink of an eye. All in all, an excellent price and value. It's marked as one of our places to return back. Congrats to the chain.",,Muriel M S,19,5.0
